   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith is
among the first in line for one. Aerobics instructor Abbie Miller
of St. Paul, Minn., has her order in. Former South Dakota Gov. Bill
Janklow says no thanks.
   They're talking about the newest generation of the Chevrolet
Corvette, the ZR-1 with an engine that puts more punch into
America's original two-seat muscle car than ever before.
   Detroit's automotive press has been gushing praise for the car,
calling it GM's high-tech answer to the Porsche and Ferrari without
their higher pricetags.
   But don't expect to see thousands of ZR-1s screaming down the
interstates at top speed with youthful joyriders at the wheel.
Chevrolet marketing experts anticipate buyers will be predominantly
college-educated males in their 40s with household incomes of at
least $100,000.
   With a production schedule of 3,000 for the 1990 model year and
a price between $50,000 and $60,000, the car ZR-1 is aimed at
luring at least some would-be customers of the European luxury
performance cars.
   ``We've clearly got enough interest in this thing to sell out
this year once we set the price and get on with it,'' said
Chevrolet spokesman Ralph Kramer.
   The final price is to be determined late this month, when the
ZR-1 begins rolling off the assembly line in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Its 5.7-liter, 32-valve, V-8 engine with 375 horsepower can
propel the car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, less time than it
takes a phone to ring three times.
   The car also comes with a special switch that shuts off half the
valves, commonly called a ``valet key'' that temporarily tames the
monster engine and prevents hot-dogging car jockeys from roaring
around the parking lot.
   The ZR-1 doesn't have the most horsepower of any assembly-line
production Corvette _ a 1967 model with 435 horsepower did _ but it
does have the highest top speed of any Corvette at about 180 mph.
It has fuel economy ratings of 16 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on
the highway, good enough to avoid the federal government's
``gas-guzzler'' tax.
   It's the latest in a long line of Corvettes, dating to the
original 300 produced in 1953. Since then, more than 900,000 have
been made and they've created a cult with its own magazines, clubs
and rallies devoted to the car's ground-hugging bullet appearance.
   ``I guess it's the excitement, it's like a dream car,'' said
Mrs. Miller, 49, who owns two other Corvettes and has had her order
in for a ZR-1 since July 24.
   As head of GM, Smith gets first dibs. He's had his order in
since late last year.
   The ZR-1 originally was planned as a 1989 car, but engineering
and marketing decisions pushed the introduction back to this month,
making it a 1990 in the automotive industry's calendar year.
   Despite the car's power, highway patrol officers evidently
aren't too worried about an outbreak of ZR-1 speed-mania.
   ``I think that irresponsible people can't afford that car, and
those people who can afford it aren't likely to risk their
investment by driving dangerously on the highway,'' he said.
``Aside from that, regardless of how fast they are, they aren't
faster than a radio.''
   Janklow, governor of South Dakota from 1978-86, is one Corvette
owner who's had some experience with law enforcement officers on
highways. He owns a 1969 T-top 427 Corvette, a car he's unafraid to
push to its limit.
   ``I was notorious for my speeding,'' said Janklow, who has
received about 100 speeding tickets. ``It's just a great
automobile. It's America's one unique touch of freedom.''
   He talks enthusiastically about his 1969 Corvette, but the ZR-1
evidently packs too much muscle for him _ Janklow said he doesn't
plan to buy one.
   Even Joe Pike, a retired Chevrolet merchandising manager and
former editor of the Corvette News magazine, said he has some
reservations about the newest model's power.
   ``I don't think there's half of 1 percent of the people who buy
that car who are capable of driving it,'' he said. ``I don't think
I could drive it anymore even if you could find a place to drive it.
   ``It's the kind of car that belongs on the Autobahn in
Germany.''

   Gm Says Future

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is considering killing its
highly touted ZR-1 Corvette because of sputtering sales for
the 375-horsepower sports car.
   A Chevrolet spokesman confirmed reports by suppliers and
Auto Week magazine that the future of the $65,000 Chevrolet
model is "under review." Chevrolet is looking at alternatives
to killing the ZR-1, including boosting the power of its
high-tech, eight-cylinder engine to rekindle its appeal, he
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But by acknowledging that the ZR-1's future is in doubt,
GM risks turning a car that was supposed to burnish the auto
maker's image into another emblem of disappointment.
   "The ZR-1 came into being for one reason only," says the
Chevrolet spokesman. "And that was to add luster to the
Corvette line and, by extension, to the entire Chevrolet
line."
   Instead, the ZR-1, nicknamed "King of the Hill," is the
latest in a string of heavily promoted GM image cars to
stumble in the market. In 1988, GM was forced to kill its
Pontiac Fiero after the plastic-bodied car's propensity to
catch fire killed demand. Earlier this year, GM pulled the
plug on its slow-selling Buick Reatta two-seater. GM
continues to produce the Cadillac Allante, a two-seater
designed to compete with exclusive Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz
roadsters. But GM has heavily discounted the $57,000 Allante
in the past because of disappointing sales.
   GM isn't alone in having trouble selling high-priced,
exotic cars in the recessionary auto market. Honda Motor
Co.'s aluminum-bodied Acura NSX sports car, which came out a
year ago to rave reviews, now appears to be struggling. Honda
sold just 86 NSX models in October, down from 270 cars a year
ago. A Honda spokesman conceded that demand is soft, although
he said the drop in NSX sales also reflects a slow launch of
1992 models.
   But many of the Corvette ZR-1's problems appear to be of
GM's making. Like the NSX, the ZR-1 started out red hot when
it was introduced in 1989, with some dealers charging
premiums of thousands of dollars above its $58,995 list price
back then. "It was absolutely wild in the beginning,"
remembers Dan Bischof, general manager of Ed Morse Chevrolet
near Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "People were calling us from all
over the U.S."
   But a year ago, GM changed the rear end of the standard
Corvette so that it looked like the ZR-1. Then, Mercury
Marine, which makes the ZR-1's 32-valve, eight-cylinder
motor, stopped production for more than three months to fix a
design flaw that was causing some ZR-1 engines to self
destruct. When production started again in April 1990, demand
for the car had chilled.
   The crowning blow came this fall, when GM put a more
powerful motor in the regular 1992 Corvette. The base
Corvette, priced at about $34,000, now accelerates to 60
miles per hour in just five seconds, only a step slower than
the sizzling 4.3-second zero-to-60 time of a ZR-1 that costs
nearly twice as much.
   The result: Dealers are now heavily discounting the ZR-1,
bad news for collectors who bought early models in hopes they
would appreciate. "We have them in stock and we've got
relatively few buyers," says Ed Morse Chevrolet's Mr.
Bischof.
   Without giving specific figures, Chevrolet says ZR-1 sales
are down, even though overall Corvette sales rose 9% in
October from a year ago. Moreover, production of the ZR-1 is
being scaled back. Mercury Marine's Stillwater, Okla.,
factory is producing just six ZR-1 engines a day, a third of
capacity. GM had expected the ZR-1 would account for 10% of
total Corvette production this year, but the company
spokesman says the actual percentage is less.
   Mercury Marine workers, meanwhile, want to save the car.
They even rigged up experimental engines that produce over
500 horsepower, says James Skalitzky, a manager in the
factory. However, those engines don't meet federal pollution
standards, he said.

<HL> Sea-Horsepowered Corvette to Cruise At Lots of Knots --- Mercury Marine to Produce All-Aluminum Engines For Special Version of Car </HL>

   Chevrolet is turning to an unusual supplier for the high-performance engine on a new Corvette sports car -- the Mercury Marine engine division of Brunswick Corp. 

   The General Motors Corp. unit said Mercury Marine will manufacture about 2,000 a year of the all-aluminum, 32-valve, 5.7-liter engines for the Corvette ZR1, a special-version model that will debut by early next spring. 

   A Chevrolet spokesman acknowledged the agreement was unusual, but added that under the circumstances, "Mercury is the best business alternative." 

   GM said Mercury is expert at getting "very high horsepower and long life from small-displacement, lightweight engines" -- an important factor in boat racing. 
Mercury, Brunswick's largest division with 1987 sales in excess of $1 billion, is a dominant force in that field, where its MerCruiser stern drives and inboard engines have set numerous speed records. 

   GM said Mercury has an exclusive license to adapt the Corvette engine for marine use, effective about one year from the car's introduction. 
That agreement is more in keeping with the companies' traditional business relationship, under which Mercury has purchased GM-made marine engines and engine blocks. 

   Brunswick said inboard boat engines aren't all that different from car engines, since both have four cycles and share the same functions. 
But the Corvette engine will have a better power-to-weight ratio than normal boat engines. 
That means once it's adapted for boats, it will have more power and weigh less than comparable engines, Brunswick said. 

   The new Corvette engine was developed and designed by GM's Group Lotus division, of Hethel, England, in conjunction with Chevrolet. 
The engine will be capable of delivering as much as 390 horsepower, which could mean top speeds nearing 200 miles an hour for the ZR1. 
A lofty top speed wasn't the objective in designing the new engine, however, said the Chevrolet spokesman, adding that the car's exact performance specifications haven't been determined yet. 

   GM sold about 25,000 Corvettes in 1987. 
The 1989 models, other than the ZR1, will go on sale at the end of September with a base price of $31,545. 
Industry watchers estimate the ZR1 will cost more than $50,000, but the Chevrolet spokesman wouldn't discuss its price.

   Jack Taylor has a saying: You don't
drive a Corvette, you wear it.
   ``If you've ever sat in one, you kind of have that feeling,''
said Taylor, director of manufacturing engineering at the General
Motors Corp. Corvette plant at Bowling Green. ``It's a statement of
people's success in life.''
   Taylor calls his 1966 blue Corvette ``an adult pacifier.''
   The cars, introduced to America in 1953, pacify such well-known
adults as Mike Love of the Beach Boys; members of the singing group
Alabama, who own four; basketball great Michael Jordan and
entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.
   The car also is the choice of such renowned speedsters as Al
Unser, Mario Andretti and Chuck Yeager. Signed photographs of their
Corvettes hang on walls in the plant's visitors' area and the snack
bar.
   This year, Chevrolet will make 26,411 cars at the only plant
that assembles the Corvette, America's first two-seat sports car.
Of these, 3,000 will be the souped up ZR-1 model.
   Corvette assembly moved to Bowling Green from St. Louis in
August 1979. The first car rolled off the Kentucky line in 1981.
The 1-million-square-foot plant, about the size of 22 football
fields, houses more than a mile of railroad track and 7{ miles of
conveyor track.
   About 1,250 workers and 65 robots produce 14 cars an hour _ a
piddling line speed in a world where many factories crank out a car
a minute.
   ``We want to make our quality the best it can be,'' said Jim
Case, a trim utility auditor. ``A person who owns a Corvette is
proud of his car. He knows everybody looks at it and wants one.''
   The price of Corvette is pushing it farther from reach.
   The standard coupe now sells for about $34,000; the convertible
for $40,000. The ZR-1, which begins production later this month,
will cost $50,000 to $60,000.
   Nonetheless, the Corvette plant tour is popular, even among
people who could never afford to buy the car. Jane Bowlin, a GM
spokeswoman, said about 40,000 people toured the plant last year,
making it one of Kentucky's most crowded tourist attractions.
   The plant also is a shrine among Corvette owners. Some leave
their calling cards.
   Corvette club patches fill a display case outside the visitors'
area. They're from the Thunder Basin Corvettes in Gillette, Wyo.;
the Vette Set from Decatur, Ill., and the Flood City Corvettes from
Johnstown, Pa.
   ``Some people take their vacation to come here,'' Mrs. Bowlin
said, pointing out patches from Hawaii, Switzerland and Sweden.
   Inside the Corvette plant, some things are done a little
differently from others.
   During the painting process, the outside of the car is covered
in plastic wrap and workers apply a flat black paint to hidden and
hard-to-reach parts, including the firewall and the inside of the
hood.
   ``We want to cover all the places only Corvette nuts would
look,'' paint supervisor Bob Breeding said.

<TEXT>     It's the National Corvette Museum Annex, barely a month old and already
becoming a shrine for 'Vette owners and adulating wanna-bees, a mecca for
legions of devotees. Museum officials say it's the first and only facility
devoted exclusively to the Corvette.;    Situated a few miles from the
museum's permanent site and near Chevrolet's Corvette plant -- the only place
that Corvettes are built -- the museum annex is quickly becoming assimilated
in the local 'Vette montage.;    "When you buy a Corvette, you're not just
buying a car. You're buying a lifestyle, a heritage, a legacy. It's a lot more
than just owning a car," said Owen Bugnaski, 28, who cruised down from Monroe,
Mich., with a friend to visit the plant and museum.; Open within a year;  The
museum, which will be on a 32-acre site across the street from the Corvette
plant, is expected to open in late 1991 or early 1992, said museum manager
Judi Hollander. Its $6 million initial construction cost is to be paid by
individual contributions and corporate sponsors, said Darrel Bowlin, a member
of the museum's board of directors.;    On the drawing board are a 250-seat
auditorium that will regularly feature a video history of the Corvette, an
auction room with a revolving floor and a library featuring technical data
books, trade journals, professional papers and car manuals.;    Also planned
is a 700-seat convention hall for car displays and exhibits, a full kitchen
for catered affairs, a visitor's restaurant and a minimum of 30 vintage,
collector-quality Corvettes.;    The storefront "mini-museum" annex has four
cars on display and a lot of Corvette souvenirs for sale.;    All this hoopla,
just for a car?;    Ah, yes, but not just a car, the faithful would say. It's
a Corvette. Introduced in January 1953, the two-seat, fiberglass-body roadster
has emerged as among the most cherished of all automobiles.;    Ironically, a
slow drive train and some corny design features in the early models nearly
killed the Corvette in its infancy.;    But by 1957, the car had been given
the looks, speed, power and handling that have been its trademark ever since.;
   The 1991 Corvette ZR-1 with a high performance engine can top 190 mph and
holds several international and world speed records, Bowlin said. It begins at
$65,000. Other 1991 'Vettes, without the high performance engine, list at
about $38,000.;    Maserati, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini -- none strike a
chord in the American car lover's heart like the Corvette -- a slicked-back,
torqued-up, distinctly American machine that has often left the hoity-toity
foreign jobs trailing in its dust.;    Lining the walls of the annex are more
than a dozen different Corvette posters, some priced over $50, that depict the
actual engineers' designs of some of the cars.;    But to get the best sense
of where Corvette fans are coming from, it's best to talk with them, watch
them together, see them around the objects of their passion.;    "I love these
cars. I always have," said Clarence Long, gazing lovingly at the sleek,
two-toned 1967 L88 LeMans Racer housed at the museum.; One of the family; 
Long has owned six different Corvettes, including a beautiful late '50s model
that a friend cracked up in an accident.;    "Oh, it was terrible. It was just
like losing a family member. I mean, the insurance company can pay you for the
life, but you can never get it back," said Long, an employee at the Corvette
plant.;    "It's the feel of the car that gets you, the speed, the feel of the
gears as you take off -- it's that vroom, vroom, vroom-vroom, VROOOOM,"
growled Long, a gleam in his eye, as his wife watched her 53-year-old husband
make odd sounds in front of a stranger.;    True believers speak in their own
language.;    They talk about prototypes and engine specifications and the
aerodynamics of the cars as if they designed the cars themselves. If it were
not for the venue, the adjectives they tossed around might have led a
passer-by to think they were discussing a beautiful woman.;    "So sleek and
smooth, yet voluptuous. Every curve is perfect, yet not obtrusive," said
visitor Jeff Gutschow, speaking in the hushed tones expected in a shrine.;

BEHIND THE WHEEL: HYBRID TURBOCHARGES ITS WAY TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The galloping Callaway Twin Turbo -- barred from California since creation 
because its builder chose not to chase state emission standards -- has cleaned 
up its act and has been cleared to sell locally. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a 190-m.p.h. pacemaker to the heartbeat of America, a private-sector 
mutagenesis of a Chevrolet Corvette that accelerates faster than a Lamborghini 
Countach or a Porsche 911 Turbo. 
</P>
<P>
With twin turbochargers building almost 400 horsepower, the Callaway can outrun 
a Ferrari Testarossa -- and the terminal velocity of that particular Italian 
redhead just happens to be faster than liftoff speed of an F-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Callaway Twin Turbo is also relatively affordable, undisputedly exclusive 
and a hot rod in sheep's cladding that may be ordered alongside Luminas and 
Corsicas at your neighborhood Chevrolet dealer. 
</P>
<P>
This assigning of an RPO (Regular Production Option) designation to the 
Callaway says a lot for GM's tolerance and acceptance of an after-market hybrid 
clearly competing in price, performance and enthusiast appeal with Chevrolet's 
super fast (but still slower) Corvette ZR-1. 
</P>
<P>
And by tacit endorsement of the Twin Turbo, Chevrolet obviously is putting its 
reputation (also its 12-month and 12,000-mile powertrain warranty) behind a 
product that meets cherished standards of reliability for sports cars that -- 
like the thirtysomething Corvette and the yearling ZR-1 -- are docile enough 
for the 'burbs yet become absolute thrashers on interstates. 
</P>
<P>
The Callaway Twin Turbo rose from a 1985 misfit -- a turbocharged, experimental 
Corvette built for Chevrolet by an outside contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet wasn't much thrilled by the prototype. But Connecticut engineer Ely 
Reeves Callaway III, former Formula Vee racer, descendant of Georgia Baptist 
preachers and Callaway Vineyards, saw it as the greatest potential for blinding 
motion since the $25 firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, with Chevrolet's blessing, Callaway was in limited production. 
Today there are some 400 Twin Turbos blowing off doors throughout 49 states. 
But not until last month's certification and satisfaction of California's 
bulletproof smog standards has the brute that purrs been available here. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, there's a limited market in the rest of the country for a high 
performance car such as this, and selling in California was the next logical 
step," said Roger Smith, managing director of Callaway Cars of Old Lyme, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we are seeing the rest of the country moving towards adopting 
California's (emission) standards. So we thought we might as well do it 
(comply) and get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
Every Twin Turbo starts life as a stock Corvette equipped with the venerable 
but trusted small block Chevy V-8. The car is shipped to Callaway's Connecticut 
skunk works where moving parts are magnafluxed and balanced. Main bearings are 
worked over. Stainless steel valves, a forged crank and pistons and a new cam 
with hydraulic lifters are added. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the heart transplant -- the addition of twin, intercooled 
turbochargers that boost the Corvette's standard 245 horsepower to 390 
horsepower, which actually is more like a stampede. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate proof of power, however, is this thing called torque -- the engine 
force that produces wheel rotation and vehicle motion. Torque is measured in 
terms of maximum oomph produced to move poundage over footage. 
</P>
<P>
The torque-feet of a Toyota Celica GT, for example, is 140 pounds-feet. The 
5.0-liter Ford Mustang puts out a very respectable 300-pounds-feet. But the 
Callaway Twin Turbo transmits a thumping 562-pounds-feet to its rear wheels and 
that's enough to leave divots in your driveway. 
</P>
<P>
For the discreet who do not wish to advertise, the Callaway Twin Turbo may be 
purchased as a coupe or convertible that externally is only a badge and a 
plaque removed from a stock Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
But the brash might choose an $8,500 Aerobody option that gives the car a row 
of flared nostrils and straked body ducts. It includes a new, slick, rounded, 
aerodynamic nose and a sculptured rear end that looks for all the world like a 
grown-up Miata with a ducktail. The whole is awfully handsome. Especially with 
the Dymag magnesium wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the car is pure 1990 Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
It also is an abomination. 
</P>
<P>
In their semicircular, Pac-Man setting, essential instruments are a mix-up of 
needles and digital readouts. Warning gauges, numbered to show only the 
extremes of their operating range, confuse before they inform. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is dash lettering that's a squint even for those with vision 
only one diopter removed from 20/20. Is this a radio we see before us? Or the 
climate control panel? Either way, the display is a litter of toy knobs and 
pitiful symbology. And the radio doesn't scan. 
</P>
<P>
On a happier note, the cockpit cuddles nicely, the seats feel rugged and hold 
well during spirited cornering, and like all Corvettes, the car comes with an 
air bag. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is no doubting that this is a Callaway. It says so on a dash plaque 
(and in the true spirit of adventure and high-speed risk, the production number 
of the test car was 007) and a boost gauge for monitoring the twin 
turbochargers. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension remains untouched and stock Corvette. So does the car's 
six-speed manual transmission. Together, they give a surplus of performance 
management that does not diminish as speed builds but actually seems to improve 
with pace. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Corvette always has been a flat, determined, obedient ride. It has 
brakes (13-inch discs) to spare for late dives into interesting corners. More 
important, there's power aplenty to boot through and out of the turns. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Corvettes come with selective ride control (Tour-Sport-Performance) and 
at no time -- even if fishtailing, overcorrecting or losing some other portion 
of the car's geometry -- is there a shadow of suspension floats or steering 
dithers. 
</P>
<P>
To all of this, add a power plant designed and tuned to do little else but 
convert a two-place car into a drill boring 190-m.p.h. holes through the air. 
</P>
<P>
But forget that speed. It isn't important. It would also be fair to state that 
nobody who owns a Callaway has ever driven it at that speed. Or will. Then why 
have it? 
</P>
<P>
Because an inordinately quick top end is simply the byproduct of searching for 
a stupendous mid-range where most mortals live. And it is here -- entering 
freeways, pulling clear of tailgaters, moving around the blind idiot cutting 
across our bows -- where the Callaway is simply astounding. 
</P>
<P>
It takes five seconds to accelerate from 60 m.p.h. to 100 m.p.h. It rockets 
from rest to 100 m.p.h. in a sniff over 10 seconds. And it is raw speed in a 
gentle hurtle where the power seems endless. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, smoothness is the pleasant surprise of the Twin Turbo. In town, in 
traffic, it's an easy drive. Shifting is a click and the clutch no heavier than 
a Honda. On the open road it's an enormous dose of docile power where the 
rear-view mirror can be forgotten because no other car will be fast enough to 
sneak up. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
That's a Callaway.

   Over Engine Flaw

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. had to stop building its
most expensive car, the $64,138 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, for
three and a half months while engineers tracked a flaw that
caused some of the 370 horsepower engines in the cars to
self-destruct, company officials confirmed yesterday.
   The ZR1, nicknamed "King of the Hill," has been the object
of considerable hyperbole from GM's Chevrolet division and
the automotive press. Car and Driver magazine called the ZR1
the "Corvette from Hell. . . so good it's scary." And dealers
cheerfully accepted offers well above sticker price from
collectors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ZR1 costs $31,683 more than the $32,455 Corvette.
That's mainly because of the ZR1's 32-valve, eight-cylinder
aluminum engine, which can fling the car from 0 to 60 miles
per hour in just 4.3 seconds. The regular Corvette has a cast
iron eight-cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepower and
takes an additional 1.4 seconds to get from 0 to 60 miles per
hour.
   But in December, GM officials quietly halted production
and sales of the car, after a vexing engine problem surfaced.
The company resumed building and selling the cars last month.
   Engineers found the problem in a defectively manufactured
camshaft, the component that regulates fuel flow into the
engine. The defect caused the engines to overheat and
ultimately "seize," a Chevrolet spokesman said. In other
words, the engines self-destructed.
   Chevrolet officials say they checked an entire batch of
500 ZR1 engines manufactured by Mercury Marine in Stillwater,
Okla. They found 17 engines with the problem, which they
dismantled in their search for the solution.
   But more importantly, Chevrolet officials say, none of the
defective engines got into the hands of buyers. "I guess the
proof of the pudding is that there haven't turned out to be
any more problems," the Chevrolet spokesman said.
   Analysts say Chevrolet handled the ZR1 problem well by
halting sales and production until they fixed it. "This is a
sign of how customer-driven manufacturers have become," says
Chris Cedergren, an industry expert with the Agoura Hills,
Calif., consulting firm J.D. Power &amp; Associates. "Things have
radically changed from 10 or 15 years ago" when manufacturers
might sell the cars anyway and later try to fix problems at
dealerships, he said.
   But Corvette customers may still end up paying more than
the sticker price. Production cutbacks caused a shortage of
ZR1s, which is likely to encourage dealers to demand high
prices, Mr. Cedergren says.

   A distinct identity for Chevrolet's Geo line of
small vehicles still hasn't been developed, nearly a year after the
first of the cars were introduced, a company executive says.
   Chevrolet General Manager Jim Perkins said Wednesday the GM
division is about halfway through its process of developing its Geo
franchise.
   The company is walking a narrow path between selling and
servicing the three Geo cars and one truck at Chevrolet dealers and
fostering a separate image for the nameplate.
   Geo cars were introduced in January. Since then, one model, the
Spectrum, has been dropped and two, the Metro and Storm, have been
added.
   Separate Geo signs are going up at dealerships and some Chevrolet
dealers are taking out space in commercial telephone books in the
G's to encourage the brand distinction.
   Also, Chevrolet's well-known ``Heartbeat of America'' advertising
theme, going into its fourth year, will not be used in Geo ads.
Instead, those ads feature the theme, ``Getting to know Geo,'' to
the tune of ``Getting to Know You,'' from the play ``The King and
I.''
   ``The Geo imagery is going to become more focused than it has
been in the past,'' Perkins said.
   Perkins, speaking during the introduction of the Chevrolet lineup
for 1990, also said GM is ready to give Chevrolet dealers a hand in
marketing the Geo and will boost the potential dealer profit margin
on Geo cars and trucks.
   GM has been criticized for failing to give consumers a clear
picture of its new line of cars. For the coming model year, there
will be three Geo cars _ the Storm, Prizm and Metro and one
sport-utility vehicle _ the Tracker.
   The Metro is made by Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. in Japan; the Tracker
is made in Canada by the GM-Suzuki joint venture Canadian-American
Manufacturing Inc.; the Prizm is made in Fremont, Calif., at the
GM-Toyota joint venture New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.; and the
Storm is made in Fujisawa, Japan, by Isuzu Motors Ltd.
   Eighty-four percent of the 4,800 Chevrolet dealers have agreed to
sell Geos. GM denied reports earlier this year that some dealers
were pressured into taking on Geo in return for getting a crack at
selling the new Corvette ZR-1, production of which begins later this
month in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Perkins said the ZR-1, with a 370-horsepower engine that can push
the car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, will sell for $58,995.
About 3,000 of the cars will be available in the United States
during the 1990 model year, mainly because of restraints by the
engine maker, Mercury Marine.
   An undetermined number of ZR-1 Corvettes will be sold in Europe,
Perkins said.
   Separately Wednesday, Ford Motor Co. rolled the first 1990
Lincoln Town Car off the assembly line in Wixom, Mich., with a
ceremony complete with a cake the shape of a 1989 Town Car. The new
version, which will be introduced formally Oct. 5, is a longer,
slightly rounded version of the 1989 model.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / ACURA NSX: A $100,000 HONDA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Berlin Wall has crumbled to paperweights, reading presidential lips 
suddenly became as unreliable as reading minds, and Southern California real 
estate is no longer a platinum hedge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet here's the absolute shocker of an audacious year: a Honda that costs 
$60,000. Or $64,000 with automatic. 
</P>
<P>
But only if you own the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Tightly limited supplies of the new, pivotal, radical and very rapid 
Honda/Acura NSX sports car already have created a scalper's market. Only 5,000 
of the cars will be made this year, and only 3,000 of those will come to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
So offers of $100,000 are being whispered. A physician in Tennessee, according 
to AutoWeek magazine, is offering his first place on a dealer's NSX waiting 
list for $33,000. A Florida broker is ready to pay dealers $10,000 above their 
sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
It's a repeat of Miata Mania -- yet a display of frantics that will surprise 
only those who still believe Japanese automobile manufacturers make unemotional 
motorcycles, build super gasoline generators and really know how to recycle 
lawn mowers into commuter cars. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of this matter: 
</P>
<P>
Honda's maiden vehicle exports were two motorcycles shipped to Okinawa in 1957. 
That was three years before Nissan came to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the short generation since: 
</P>
<P>
* Of all new automobiles sold in California, 50% are imported. When it comes to 
reliable, thrifty, pretty, zippy, little imported cars, Japan owns the 
showroom. 
</P>
<P>
* Lexus and Infiniti have grabbed the luxury performance car market by the 
lapels. Mercedes, Jaguar and BMW aren't exactly shaking in their Connelly 
leather britches, but the big dogs are reducing prices or introducing less 
expensive entry-level vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* Now comes a hefty sports car, the fastest, most expensive Japanese car ever, 
to raid and plunder the stables of Ferrari and Porsche, builders of lusty 
exotics that offer performance close to the speed of thought. 
</P>
<P>
And the Acura NSX, this car that will be king of Acura, Honda's upscale 
division, is offering easily in its first year what others have struggled to 
deliver after more than four decades of development. 
</P>
<P>
The competition are gladiators all. From Italy, weighing in at $103,000, the 
Ferrari 348. From Germany, where the motor car was born a century ago, the 
Porsche 911 Carrera at $72,000. From the United States, wearing skinned 
knuckles and drinking Budweiser from the can, comes the Corvette ZR-1 at 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier cultures, these cars would be considered talismans to be buried 
alongside their masters. Top speeds usually exceed a driver's weight. They are 
useless for anything but going fast and reminding the self-indulgent of their 
limitations. They certainly do not kiss back. 
</P>
<P>
The NSX snarls with the baddest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it doesn't roar louder than the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
Externally, from any view, whether seeing styling or examining aerodynamic 
design, the NSX is superb and doubtless one of the most handsome cars ever. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin-forward design starts with a short nose and a gentle slope reserved 
for high-performance vehicles built to slide beneath and shove aside 
obstructive air. Just like a Group C racing car. 
</P>
<P>
Amidships -- and for the full length of the doors -- twin horizontal lines 
leading to rear fuselage air scoops visually lower the car and accent its 
Nutra-Slim look. 
</P>
<P>
The roof line resembles a canopy, and the rear rises to an aerofoil; the 
profile is of a jet fighter's vertical stabilizer. That's no accident: In its 
search for the optimum silhouette of speed and purpose, Acura researched 
America's aeronautical designs, in particular General Dynamics' F-16 Fighting 
Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
From an engineering standpoint, the NSX is probably a decade ahead of its time. 
Here is a car with an all-aluminum monocoque body and subframe, and at 460 
pounds, the chassis weighs less than a sumo wrestling tag team. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension is cast aluminum (mounted on a nice piece of walnut, the 
wishbones would make sensational bookends), with a unique, additional strut to 
prevent the front wheels from kicking out of true when riding road bumps. 
</P>
<P>
The engine uses lighter, stronger (and frightfully expensive) titanium 
connecting rods. There's also something called a Variable Valve Timing and Lift 
Electronic Control System (VTEC), an automatic orchestration of cams and 
valves. In essence, it creates a 20-horsepower reserve that is uncorked only 
when the car's performance must graduate from serious to competitive. On 
fighter aircraft, it used to be called combat boost. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is five-star and flawless. Leather-covered seats are closer to 
custom chairs with a full, but unobtrusive shoulder support for tighter turns. 
These are better than the most expensive custom seats by Recaro. 
</P>
<P>
Vision would only be better if your head were inside a goldfish bowl. There's 
even clear sighting to back corners and directly behind the car, a weak spot 
among mid-engined cars that traditionally have had gun slits for rear windows. 
</P>
<P>
The engine note is a ripper. The shifter couldn't be smoother in buttermilk. 
Headroom is just enough for anyone 6-foot-4. There's sufficient luggage space 
for a weekend away with even overdressed beloveds, although the trunk is set 
against the engine, so be prepared for hot baggage. Or it may be used to warm 
take-out lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
Only one fault: Lighting is dim on digital displays telling the driver what the 
radio and climate controls are supposed to be doing. In sunlight, they 
disappear entirely. 
</P>
<P>
But with its thinner air bag fabric (for a smaller lump in the steering wheel) 
to automatic traction control (which completely tames the overcontrol buffoon 
in all of us), the car is a technological marvel. 
</P>
<P>
If only Honda/Acura had moved a little faster. 
</P>
<P>
For the NSX was conceived in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Its announced targets at that time were the Porsche 911, the Chevrolet Corvette 
and the Ferrari 328. And the Acura NSX clearly is superior to all three. 
</P>
<P>
But they were cars of seven years ago, and in the development cycle since, 
Porsche has produced the all-wheel drive Carrera 4. Chevrolet built a day of 
thunder it called the ZR-1. And Ferrari recently began selling the 348ts. 
</P>
<P>
We have driven them all. 
</P>
<P>
The NSX generally is superior in engineering, design and technology, but only a 
peer in performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of the average to better driver, nothing corners sweeter, flatter 
and safer than the all-wheel Carrera 4. The NSX is only a rear-wheel drive 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
No sports car offers more muscle for the buck than the Corvette ZR-1. The NSX 
isn't quite so quick from zero to 60 m.p.h. and has a slightly slower top 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari 348ts can claim an identical edge at the top end. And in its maiden 
year, the NSX cannot possibly match the 40-year racing heritage, mystique, 
exclusivity and visceral appeal of Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Acura's 3-liter engine and 270 horsepower were a significant threat to 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1990, that engine has lightened a little alongside the 3.4 liters (290 
horsepower) of Ferrari, the 3.6 liters (247 horsepower) of Porsche and the 3.5 
liters (375 horsepower) of the Corvette ZR-1. 
</P>
<P>
Acura officials have heard the comparisons, express no concerns and counter 
with some acceptable arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The ZR-1, they said, survives only on brute strength. Handling is coarse, and 
the fit and finish barely American average. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche Carrera? A tired, 25-year-old design, they said, on the life-support 
system of modern technology. Also more expensive than the NSX. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari 348ts? A purist's car and a hard drive. And twice as expensive as the 
NSX. 
</P>
<P>
Would that our road test could have produced an honest conclusion. Or, at the 
very least, some understanding of the near-total canonization of the NSX by 
automotive magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But our test car had been their test car. 
</P>
<P>
It was production prototype 007 that had been ridden hard and put away wet by 
motoring journalists from the United States, Canada and Japan. Even dealers got 
to lap this one at 150-m.p.h. So, at 4,400 miles, the car was close to the end 
of its career as a performance punching bag. 
</P>
<P>
But we took the NSX to Willow Springs Raceway anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of its heart remained to be impressive on some smart laps of the 
facility's secondary circuit, the tight, often tortuous Streets of Willow 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The car has grip and balance, and when its ends get loose, the wagging is both 
predictable and correctable. 
</P>
<P>
Even adjusting to the car's oversteer snap-roll (created when over-correcting a 
drifting tail, failing to catch lateral forces and blushing when stored energy 
whips the car in the opposite direction), quickly becomes a reflex because the 
buildup and release is so constant. 
</P>
<P>
The steering, which is unassisted, seemed a little on the thick side, and that 
created a heavy turn-in. And there was a constant understeer. 
</P>
<P>
But on the highway, lightness and feel return, and the register is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Track. Highway. Those dual personalities, and the broad division between polite 
jogger and Olympic athlete, is the enormous gift of the Acura NSX. 
</P>
<P>
In traffic, around town, harumphing through clotted freeways or settled down on 
a pleasant and legal run along the coast to Santa Barbara, the NSX is relaxed 
and terribly smooth. It is a touring car. 
</P>
<P>
But when the going gets tough and the tough get rambunctious, quick shifts and 
a heavy foot unleash that extra horsepower in the higher engine ranges. And the 
NSX becomes a race car. 
</P>
<P>
Then that mid-engine sets up serious wails behind a driver's right ear and the 
moment rises to a breathtaking blur in search of a checkered flag. It is pure 
performance, even Ferrari pace, and certainly with Porsche's poise. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, being a Ferrari for the masses most certainly isn't a bad place to 
occupy. Especially when one considers that Acura has earned that heady spot in 
the Major Leagues from its first at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Honda officials acknowledge that with huge development costs and limited 
production numbers, the NSX -- which goes on sale Wednesday -- will not be a 
money maker. But they do expect it to be an image-enhancer for the Acura line. 
</P>
<P>
It also is worth noting that Porsche, Ferrari and Chevrolet are not known for 
nimbleness of product development. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese car builders are. 
</P>
<P>
And senior types at Honda are not reluctant to discuss tomorrow's NSX, 
enlarging that V-6, adding turbocharging and all-wheel drive -- and noting how 
quickly they can bring a second generation NSX to market. 
</P>
<P>
Then watch out.

<TEXT>     The problem was discovered in November when seven of the car's
370-horsepower engines broke down as workers revved the engines at the
assembly plant's shipping yard, Hoxie said.;    Chevrolet located the entire
batch of 500 ZR1s with engines made by Mercury Marine in Stillwater, Okla.,
all at dealerships and in the shipping yard, and found that 17 had defective
engines, Hoxie said.;    There was no official recall as production was halted
from early December through March 16. The plant makes all types of Corvettes
and there were no layoffs due to the defect, he said.;    If it were not for
the production halt, about 1,500 cars would have been built in that time. The
normal production is 3,600 a year.;    "It's taking a while to catch up,"
Hoxie said. "Obviously it's going to affect the annual production.";    The
shortage may cause dealerships to raise the prices, an auto analyst said.;   
Chris Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp; Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif., said the
No. 1 automaker handled the situation well by correcting the problem at the
assembly plant level, rather than selling the cars anyway and letting the
dealerships handle recalls.;    The ZR1 has a 32-valve, eight-cylinder
aluminum engine that can zoom from zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds.;    They
discovered the engines' camshafts were slightly oversized, but found that the
breakdowns were due to a combination of situations. The engines that blew out
had never been started up before and were stored in below-freezing
temperatures, Hoxie said.;    "There are a series of circumstances that had to
exist for it to happen," Hoxie said.;    John Harris, sales manager at Vermont
Chevrolet in Los Angeles, said Monday that his business was not affected by
the stopped production.;    "I didn't have a single one in stock," he said.
"Not a lot of people can afford those."  </TEXT>

   A sizzling hot Corvette, a quartet of new
Japanese luxury cars, federally mandated safety devices and an
influx of four-door trucks from overseas top the new car and truck
news for the 1990 model year.
   While consumers are admiring all the new sheet metal and
technological changes for the new vehicles, they may find
themselves hit with a dose of sticker shock. Prices for 1990 cars
are higher, and part of the reason is safety.
   The federal government ruled that cars manufactured after Sept.
1, 1989, must have either supplemental air bags or automatic seat
belts on the driver's side.
   Cars with air bags also must have manually operated lap and
shoulder belts. By the 1994 model year, passive restraints _ either
air bags or automatic belts _ must be standard for the front-seat
passenger, too.
   All Chrysler models built in the U.S., about 15 percent of the
General Motors fleet and just less than half of Ford's will have
standard air bags this year.
   Costs of the systems, which manufacturers often decline to
reveal, could add hundreds of dollars to the price of a 1990 car.
Each of the Big Three has blamed air bags for part of its price
increases.
   In the truck market, importers were shaking in their boots in
January and February, worrying about whether the Treasury
Department would classify their sport-utility vehicles as cars,
with a 2{ percent tariff, or as trucks, with a duty 10 times
stiffer.
   The department ruled, in effect, that four-door vehicles are
primarily for passenger use, making them cars, and two-door
versions are mostly for commercial purposes, making them trucks.
   That ruling had a direct impact on the prices of the imported
trucks, which already had been hurt by a currency exchange rate
that ballooned prices of their vehicles. The number of two-door
sport-utility vehicles from overseas will drop substantially.
   In the United States, Chevrolet is making just 3,000 of its new
Corvette ZR-1 cars, which have engines packing 370 horsepower to
push the sports car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. The consumer
is going to pay the price for all that power, though. The sticker
on the ZR-1 carries a base price of $58,995.
   The much-publicized entry of two Japanese luxury car lines,
Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus, has occurred. The cars, two
from each division, first were shown during January on the
auto-show circuit. They will be marketed through dealers separate
than those franchised by their parent companies, as are Honda's
Acura cars now.
   Here's a nameplate-by-nameplate look at major manufacturers'
offerings for the 1990 model year in the United States:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENERAL MOTORS CORP.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CHEVROLET _ GM's largest division is marketing under the Geo
banner a new line of three cars _ the Metro, Prizm and Storm _ and
a sport-utility vehicle _ the Tracker. None of the cars is made by
GM itself; two are made by joint ventures and two are made in
Japan. Geo vehicles are aimed at potential imported car buyers.
   Chevrolet is the first of three GM divisions to sell the
company's new plastic-body minivan. The Chevrolet Lumina APV, like
the Pontiac Trans Sport and the Oldsmobile Silhouette, has a
radical wedge design.
   Chevrolet began marketing its Lumina sedan in April as a
replacement for the Celebrity sedan. The Lumina coupe will be in
dealerships this fall. The Beretta nameplate gets a new GTZ model
with a Quad 4 engine and a convertible; Corsica, Cavalier and
Camaro models get new engines, while Caprice remains essentially
the same. The Celebrity nameplate stays only on a station wagon.
   More than a dozen new Chevrolet truck models are on tap for
1990, including four-wheel drive and extended versions of the Astro
cargo van and a new ``454 SS'' full-size pickup with a heavy-duty
engine.
   PONTIAC _ The so-called GM performance division is featuring an
all-wheel drive option on the 6000 S-E (which replaces the 6000 STE
of last year), a four-door Grand Prix and a Turbo Grand Prix for
its car line and the Trans Sport version of GM's minivan.
   Upgraded engines are due for the Grand Am, Grand Prix, 6000
series and Firebird models. The sunroof is being dropped from all
Grand Am models.
   Otherwise, a Sunbird LE convertible replaces the GT convertible.
The Bonneville and LeMans undergo minor changes.
   BUICK _ The convertible Reatta two-seater finally debuts in 1990
after several delays. Three new Regal sedans will be introduced in
mid-1990.
   Buick is replacing the LeSabre-Electra wagon designations with
the Estate Wagon name. Otherwise, the Skylark, Century, LeSabre,
Electra, Park Avenue and Park Avenue Ultra remain essentially the
same.
   OLDSMOBILE _ A new Cutlass Supreme sedan, the Silhouette and a
Cutlass convertible are new for 1990. The division also has
restyled the Toronado and Trofeo to make them longer and smoother.
   New engines are available on some cars in the Cutlass line,
including the Quad 442 on the Calais, reviving the 442 name that
Oldsmobile originally introduced in 1964.
   Few changes are on tap for the Ninety-Eight, Eighty-Eight
Royale, Touring Sedan, Cutlass Cruiser Wagon and the Custom Cruiser
Wagon.
   CADILLAC _ GM's flagship line retains six cars for 1990, each of
which has anti-lock brakes as standard or optional equipment.
   The Allante two-seater will be offered as a convertible or as a
soft top with an aluminum hardtop. The Allante will have a traction
control system as standard equipment. More powerful engines will be
available in the De Ville, Fleetwood, Seville and Eldorado models.
   Driver-side air bags will be standard equipment in the Allante,
De Ville, Fleetwood, Seville and Eldorado models.
   GMC TRUCKS _ A new all-wheel-drive GMC Safari van with standard
anti-lock brakes on passenger versions will debut in 1990. Rear
anti-lock brakes will be standard on Rally and Vandura vans,
full-size Jimmy utility vehicles and Suburban wagons.
   Also, extended Rally and Vandura models will be available, and
4.3-liter V-6 engines will be standard on all S-145 Jimmy and
four-wheel-drive S-15 pickups.

<HEAD>Acura's `Little Ferrari': An Eye- and Money-Catcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While some car buyers are drawn to big rebates,
others can't resist paying $40,000 over list price for a new set of
wheels.
   The Acura NSX is commanding that kind of money from those who
want an exotic car without a Ferrari or Lamborghini price tag.
   ``It's a bargain,'' said sales manager Betsy Volaric of Sunshine
Acura in Farmington Hills.
   The NSX, which looks a bit like a shrunken Ferrari Testarosa,
carries a list price of $60,000 with a manual transmission and
$63,000 for one with an automatic.
   But since Acura, the luxury division of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. of
Japan, plans to import just 3,000 of them a year, demand is far
outpacing supply.
   That pumps up the price.
   Premiums on cars are nothing new to the auto industry. Last
year, buyers shelled out up to $25,000 for the hard-to-get Mazda
Miata, which carried a base price of $13,800.
   Volaric said her dealership, one of 300 Acura dealers in the
country, is tacking $20,000 to $25,000 onto the price of the NSX,
because that's what the market will bear.
   ``Anybody who is familiar with the exotic car market realizes
that $85,000 is a bargain,'' she said. Ferraris and Lamborghinis
begin at more than $100,000 and stretch past $300,000 each, before
any premium.
   Acura spokesman Mike Spencer said dealers in markets with high
exotic-car interest, such as Los Angeles and Miami, are getting up
to $100,000 for an NSX - $40,000 over sticker price.
   ``Legally, we can't tell the dealers what to sell the cars
for,'' he said. ``At the same time, they look at this as `Geez, if
Isell the car to a speculator for $60,000 and he turns around and
sells it for $80,000 to $90,000, who's the fool here?'''
   A fool has no place behind the wheel of an NSX. The sleek,
two-seater packs a 3-liter, V-6 engine which puts out 270
horsepower. It's top speed is rated around 165 mph, and it can go
from a standing start to 60 mph in about 5.5 seconds.
   Tooling around Detroit freeways in an NSX causes normally vacant
highway stares to come alive. Even at highway speeds, motorists
hover around the NSX for a closer look.
   In a recent test drive:
   -The driver of a Mazda RX-7 on the right looked for a minute,
dropped back for a different view, came up on the left for another
peek and moved to the front to take a look at the NSX in his
rearview mirror.
   Afterwards, he dropped back to the right, nodded his head up and
down vigorously and flashed a thumbs-up sign.
   -A load of what appeared to be teen-agers in an Oldsmobile
pulled alongside and accelerated, appearing to dare a highway race.
The NSX is a conspicuous car and the offer was ignored.
   Parked at a local mall, the car was a magnet for nearly everyone
who walked by, including car crazies and store clerks.
   ``I thought it was a Ferrari,'' said Denise DiDonato, of
Rochester Hills, a cosmetics clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue in a
suburban Detroit shopping mall. ``It's cute, very cute.''
   She owns a 1990 Lincoln Town Car - 56.8 inches longer and 1,000
pounds heavier than an NSX.
   Kevin Corcoran, of Franklin, could have been doing an
advertisement for the car: ``It's extraordinarily flashy and
reasonably priced as far as these things go. There's a lot of
Italian in it.''
   Corcoran owns a pickup, in which he spends most of his highway
time, and a McLaren, an extremely low-volume exotic sports car.
   With a target volume of 3,000 annually, the NSX doesn't pose a
significant volume threat to any car now being sold in the United
States.
   It's priced somewhere around a Porsche 911, the Mercedes-Benz
300-series, a BMW 7-series or a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1, the
hottest car made by a major American manufacturer.
   The NSX doesn't look nearly as muscular as the ZR-1, and it
isn't. The ZR-1's 5.7-liter, V-8 engine produces 375 horsepower,
nearly 30 percent more than the NSX.
   The all-aluminum NSX makes up for some of that difference in
weight, coming in at 3,010 pounds compared with the ZR-1 at 3,465
pounds.
   Canadian visitor Craig Donnelly is an NSX fan. He said he had a
poster of a black one back home in Ottawa, where he also has a
Pontiac Sunbird.
   ``It's got the same size engine as that,'' he said nodding to
the NSX, ``but it doesn't go like that.''

   Chrysler Corp. has decided to produce its
proposed Viper sports car featuring a 10-cylinder engine, a source
said Tuesday, a move apparently designed to polish the image of the
struggling carmaker.
   The Dodge Viper, equipped with an engine originally designed for
truck use, will go into extremely low-volume production late next
year for the 1992 model year, said a company source speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Anything that shows people that Dodge is back in the
performance business is good news,'' said David Slone, general
sales manager of Lynn Hickey Dodge in Oklahoma City.
   A Viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto
show in Detroit and drew huge crowds. The two-seat convertible is a
throwback to the era of sleek, muscular sports cars with few
electronic gadgets.
   The prototype has been part of a six-city tour this spring
during which Chrysler executives have touted the quality of the
company's vehicles, comparing them favorably with those made by
Japanese automakers.
   The tour winds up Friday in Los Angeles, where Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca is expected to announce that the Viper will go into
production.
   Such an announcement would come as Chrysler car sales and
profits slip and as the company struggles to carve $1.5 billion
from its annual $26 billion budget.
   The cost of the Viper project hasn't been pinpointed. Despite
that expense at a time when the company is trimming back, analysts
and dealers on Tuesday were enthusiastic about the project, not
only because of the exotic nature of the car, but because of the
traffic it can draw to dealerships.
   Slone said he already has noticed an increase in traffic through
his showroom just because of media attention the Viper has received.
   ``We've had people wanting to put deposits down on it,'' he said.
   The car's price won't be announced until just before it hits the
showrooms. AutoWeek magazine said it could be in the $40,000 range.
   The Viper would be entering the exotic sports-car market,
broadly comprised of the Corvette ZR-1, some BMWs and Porsches.
   No firm performance statistics were available, but AutoWeek
magazine reported that with the V-10 engine, the Viper could go
from a standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds. The ZR-1,
the hottest Corvette ever, takes 11.5 seconds to get to 100 mph,
according to a Road &amp; Track magazine road test.
   ``There is an enthusiasts' market out there,'' said auto analyst
Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``I
think there is room in the market for it (Viper). I think the hot
cars carry fairly nice (profit) margins and you wouldn't have to
put an incentive on them.
   ``I think it will make people sit up and notice Chrysler even
though there aren't many (Vipers) around. It's what they can do in
styling and performance.''
   The prototype has distinctive door panels with chrome-plated
exhaust pipes running below them. A spy photo appearing in the June
issue of Car and Driver magazine shows a Viper without the
side-mounted pipes.
   The source said all major components of the car would be made by
Chrysler. The source declined to reveal the final assembly site,
but said it would be an existing Chrysler factory.
   Production figures weren't available, but it could be as low as
a few hundred a year. By contrast, General Motors Corp. sold about
24,000 Corvettes last year, before the introduction of the ZR-1
model.
   Chrysler has said that the Viper was the first project to result
from the carmaker's conceptual design and rendering system. The
computer-driven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time
needed to bring a totally new car to market, Chrysler officials
said.

   Rain Poses Acid Test
   For Auto Exteriors

   ACID RAIN threatens lakes and forests, many scientists
say, but what about cars?
   An Environmental Protection Agency study finds that acid
rain etches dull-looking spots into a car's paint. That's
because the acids in rainwater don't evaporate, but instead
become more concentrated as the raindrops dry. Heat from the
sun or engine increases the damage.
   The spots are hard to detect on light-colored vehicles but
are easily found on darker cars, especially black ones. The
spots are also easier to see under fluorescent lights than in
sunlight.
   Car owners living on the East Coast are most likely to see
the dull spots on their cars, because the region's rain is
more acidic than in the rest of the country. However, people
living elsewhere will probably detect spots if they examine
their cars closely.
   "There is little doubt that the problem is widespread,"
says Edward Edney, an EPA researcher who has studied the
effects of acid rain and fog. The only cure is prevention:
keeping cars out of rain or fog, or drying them immediately
after exposure.
   Some auto makers are working with paint suppliers to find
a solution. General Motors and Chrysler, for example, each
have developed a clear protective coating to go on top of
paint. GM says its coating, developed about two years ago, is
effective at spot prevention even though it wasn't developed
specifically to combat acid rain. The coating is currently
being used on about half of its vehicles, GM says, and will
be put on more in the future.
   Chrysler, which introduced its coating in February, says
it was designed to protect against acid rain and works well
in most regions of the country. Chrysler uses it in three
assembly plants and expects to use it in most of its
facilities by July.
                                                                                                       

   They Help You to Pick
   Peaches, Not Lemons
                                                                                                       

   THE HIGH PRICE of new cars has many buyers looking for
used ones, but how do you avoid getting taken? Try calling an
expert.
   A growing number of firms will, for a fee, inspect used
cars and tell potential buyers how much they're actually
worth. Car Checkers of America, for example, inspects 3,500
electrical and mechanical components of used cars. The
company also determines whether a car has been involved in an
accident and whether it's starting to rust. The inspection
costs between $75 and $100, and takes about an hour.
   "Just listening and looking isn't enough anymore," says
Lee S. Geller, vice president of Car Checkers, in
Bridgewater, N.J. Business has jumped 30% since the recession
began, he says. Auto Critic of America, in Dallas, performs a
90-point inspection for between $54 and $79, grading such
components as the battery, air conditioner and transmission
on a scale of A (high quality) to F (poor quality). Patrick
A. Ludwick, president, expects the two-year-old company to
earn its first profit this year.
   Most companies that inspect used cars send technicians to
the vehicle's location, even if it's a dealer's lot. While it
seems this might irk dealers, the companies claim they're
welcome. "Many dealers pay us" to determine the quality and
value of used-car trade-ins, Mr. Geller says.
   "These companies can serve a purpose," says Marion Gorton
of the Michigan attorney general's office. "The inspection
gives consumers the opportunity to find out what's obviously
wrong with the car." The companies don't do repairs, and most
require customers to sign a disclaimer releasing the firms of
liability in case a highly rated car turns out to be a lemon.
                                                                                                       

   It's Very, Very Fast,
   But It Isn't Moving
                                                                                                       

   GENERAL MOTORS' highly touted Corvette ZR-1 once fetched
as much as $80,000 -- a whopping $15,862 above its suggested
retail price. But now, some dealers are having trouble
selling the car -- even below retail.
   The ZR-1, nicknamed King of the Hill, was a hit with
auto-enthusiast magazines. They loved the 32-valve,
eight-cylinder, 370-horsepower aluminum engine that zips the
car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a bone-jarring 4.3
seconds. GM won't disclose the number of ZR-1 models -- as
opposed to regular Corvettes -- it has sold this year, but
concedes that sales have slowed.
   So why has demand for GM's most exotic and expensive car
cooled? The auto maker's Chevrolet division contends that
after a year on the market, the ZR-1 is no longer a new, hot
item. "It's a natural thing in the marketplace," says a
spokesman for the division, who also cites the effects of the
recession.
   But a mechanical snafu also may have damped consumer
enthusiasm. GM had to stop selling the car for 3 1/2 months
while correcting a problem -- it turned out to be some
defective camshafts -- that caused some engines to overheat
and "seize," or self-destruct.
                                                                                                       

   Buy a Trendy Couch
   And Get a Car to Match
                                                                                                       

   WANT TO KNOW which car colors will be hot in few years? Go
shopping for a new sofa or drapes.
   The colors of home furnishings are one of the leading
indicators that car companies track to figure out colors to
paint their cars. Turquoise, a trendy color today on sporty
cars, first showed up in furniture in the Southwest. White,
the leading color today, also has made a comeback in home
appliances, such as refrigerators.
   Right now, auto makers are deciding colors for the 1994
models. Turquoise and aqua (along with perennial favorites
red, white and blue) are expected to be popular still.

<TEXT>
   From the 700 Corvettes in the 20-mile
road tour to the 200 radio-controlled models in their own road
race, there was something for every Corvette fan at the Bloomington
Gold-Corvettes USA show.
   There's also the coveted Bloomington Gold certificate for the
Chevrolet two-seaters preserved in or restored to 95 percent of the
showroom condition.
   And there's a classification for ``Survivors,'' Corvettes at
least 20 years old that have been largely unrestored but preserved
well enough to serve as models for those doing restoration.
   In excellent condition, a Corvette built between 1963 and 1967
could fetch up to $100,000, says David Burroughs, president of the
show.
   Some custom-built racing models go even higher. Five Grand Sport
Corvettes produced in 1963 exclusively for racing are worth up to
$1 million, Burroughs says.
   Next on the most-valuable list would be the L88 Corvette, says
Burroughs. Produced from 1967 to 1969, and also built for racing,
L88s sell for $100,000 to $500,000. Only about 200 of the cars were
built.
   The demand for Corvettes is changing, though, Burroughs says.
The 'Vettes of the 1950s are popular with people who grew up then,
but as baby boomers become able to invest in the cars, the 1963-67
models are becoming more popular.
   About 35,000 people and as many as 5,000 Corvettes were expected
for this year's show, which concluded Sunday with judging and the
radio-controlled finals.

<HEAD>Big Engines, Luxury Cars Trendy Items at Geneva Motor Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Extravagant, sporty cars with powerful engines and
fancy technical frills are headline items at the 1989 Geneva Motor
Show, reflecting the auto industry's buoyant confidence.
   Organizers of the annual show, which opened Thursday and runs
until March 19, cite the worldwide comeback of the top-priced sports
car and renewed competition in the compact model range as this
year's major themes.
   Billed as the European show most representative of the global
industry, Geneva is considered a prime testing ground for automakers
because of Switzerland's liberal import policy and lack of a
domestic industry, which make it a highly competitive market.
   Opel, Volkswagen and Toyota were the top-selling makes in
Switzerland last year, followed by Ford Europe, Fiat and France's
Peugeot.
   The industry's optimism is evident after low oil prices and a
continuing economic boom in Western countries spurred world car
production to its fourth straight record high last year.
   The show appears aimed at Western Europe, where environmental
worries had an impact on the car industry through the mid-1980s.
   But that concern seems to be waning. The European Community has
launched a drive to cut harmful exhaust emissions, and use of
pollution-reducing catalytic converters, though hardly universal, is
rising.
   At Geneva, Mercedes unveiled its revived SL roadster series,
aimed at recapturing affluent buyers from its West German rival BMW,
whose 7-series is considered the leader in the upscale market.
   BMW's display featured the M5, a model introduced last fall with
a 315-horsepower six-cylinder engine.
   Not to be outdone, General Motors Corp. offered an updated
Corvette sports model with a 32-valve V-8. The Corvette ZR1, is
expected to cost about $50,000. GM officials have not said when the
ZR1 will go on sale in the United States or Europe.
   Porsche, the West German maker of prestige sports cars,
highlighted a new automatic tire pressure monitoring system in its
top-of-the-line 928-S4 model, which lists for $74,900.
   Volvo of Sweden offered a heated steering wheel for its
higher-priced cars.
   Recognizing the continuing vast market potential for affordable
compact cars especially in Europe, Ford Motor Co.'s West German
division premiered a complete revamp of its successful Fiesta
hatchback, of which more than 4.5 million have been built since 1976.
   Main innovations include four-door models, more passenger space
and an updated body. Prices have remained stable, ranging from about
$8,200 for the basic models to $12,500 for a sporty three-door.
   Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz said in opening the 59th
show that the event was a ``convincing denial'' of a clash between
economic and environmental goals.

less than 10 seconds. A Corvette ZR-1 takes about 11.5 seconds,
according to a road test in Road &amp; Track magazine.
   The announcement of Viper's production will be during the last
of a six-city road show Chrysler has been conducting since March.
The program is aimed at boosting interest in Chrysler products and
quality.
   A concept version of the Viper made its debut in January 1989 at
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Chrysler
Motors President Robert Lutz, design Vice President Thomas Gale and
other executives have backed efforts to make Viper.
   Gale said last year the Viper was the first project to result
from Chrysler's conceptual design and rendering system. The
computer-driven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time
needed to bring a totally new car to market, Gale said.

   Chrysler Corp.'s decision to go ahead with
production of its high-performance Viper sports car may not make
much money for the strapped automaker, but it could draw crowds
into dealer showrooms, analysts say.
   A company source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday that Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca would announce approval
of the project at a news conference Friday in Los Angeles.
   The source had few details about the project, but said it was
aimed at starting production in late 1991 for the 1992 model year.
   Production volume and a retail price were not available.
However, there have been reports that Chrysler was aiming at
building no more than a few thousand a year, and AutoWeek magazine
said its price could be as much as $40,000.
   The cost of the project also was not available. But company
officials said use of a new computer-aided design process was
helping keep costs down.
   The car would be equipped with a V-10 engine which reportedly
would put it in a performance class with the hottest Corvette ever
made, the ZR-1. AutoWeek said it has the capability of going from a
standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds. The Corvette
ZR-1 reaches the same speed in about 11.5 seconds, according to a
road test in Road &amp; Track magazine.
   Some analysts questioned the wisdom of developing such a
muscular, narrowly focused car when Chrysler is wrestling with
slumping sales and in the throes of a $1.5 billion cost-cutting
program.
   Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said he wasn't excited about
the project but thought it would do respectably well in the market.
   ``If you are going to make a penny on it in low volume, you're
going to have to price it up there,'' he said.
   Analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New
York said there was a place for the car.
   ``There is an enthusiasts market out there,'' she said. ``If
they come out with something that's really sensational, it's
conceivable they could sell out however many they choose to make.''
   Sudol and Brady agreed that the Viper should serve as a magnet
in dealerships, drawing in curious consumers who may end up buying
something else.
   That's already happened at Lynn Hickey Dodge of Oklahoma City,
general sales manager David Slone said. He said media reports of
the car have boosted showroom traffic.
   ``I know we've sold one Daytona off it,'' he said. ``Anything
that piques the traffic is what we want. Anything that shows people
that Dodge is back in the performance business is good news.''
   A Viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto
show in Detroit and drew huge crowds. The two-seat convertible is a
throwback to the era of sleek, high-powered sports cars with few
electronic gadgets.
   The prototype has been part of a six-city tour this spring
during which Chrysler executives have touted the quality of the
company's vehicles, comparing them favorably with those made by
Japanese automakers. The tour ends Friday in Los Angeles.

Corvette collector/trading cards called the Vette Set. The 100 glossy,
full-color cards depict every Corvette built as well as some that made it to
dream-car status but never into production.;    They arrived at the San
Francisco Card Exchange last week. Vette Set cards will be sold in packs of 10
for $1.25 to $1.50.;    Neil and John Connor formed Collect-A-Card about a
year ago. Their first trading card set was of Professional Bowling Association
stars. Then Neil, a former marketing executive with an organ company, and
John, a retired postal clerk, decided to move into cars.;    "There's 'Vette
people everywhere -- those who own one, once owned one or who just like the
car," John said. "There's more than 7,000 Corvette clubs across the country.";
   Collect-A-Card has a five-year non-exclusive agreement with Chevrolet to
produce the cards. It paid a hefty license fee and will pay a royalty for
cards sold.;    The cards feature a photo of each car on the front and some
statistics and special features on the back. Whereas baseball cards provide a
rundown on the player's stats, including times at bat, hits and lifetime
average, the 'Vette cards list the total number assembled of that particular
model, base price when new, optional body styles if any, colors, engine
options, and vital serial numbers cherished by car collectors.;    Though the
brothers hope to capitalize on the collecting habits of 'Vette enthusiasts,
neither owns a 'Vette. Neil drives a Honda Acura and John a GMC Jimmy.;  IF

<HEAD>Old-Time Parade For Astronauts To Feature Vintage Corvettes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Astronauts from the shuttle Discovery
will ride in vintage Corvettes once driven by speed-loving pioneers
in the nation's space program for a nostalgic parade Monday in this
Space Coast town.
   From 1967 to 1971, a Melbourne Chevrolet dealership gave
astronauts the cars of their choice for $1 a year under a
promotional lease.
   Almost all chose Corvettes and they were easily spotted. Each
was red, white or blue, with two stripes in the other patriotic
colors slashed across the hood and trunk.
   ``Being the hot-footed test pilots they were _ craving for speed
_ it was only natural for them to choose Corvettes,'' said Jim
Falkowski of Fort Lauderdale, who paid $25,000 for astronaut Gus
Grissom's 1967 convertible Corvette and has been offered $52,000
for it.
   Grissom, one of the seven original Mercury astronauts, drove the
car until he died in the Apollo 1 launch pad fire in 1967.
   A 1968 Corvette originally owned by astronaut Alan Shepard will
be used in Monday's parade, along with two 1988 Corvette
convertibles on loan from Jim Rathmann Chevrolet in Melbourne.
   The five-mile motorcade, from Patrick Air Force Base to a Cocoa
Beach motel, will be modeled after a half-dozen parades held in
Cocoa Beach for astronauts during the 1960s.
   Thousands of people lined the streets from the air base to Cape
Canaveral during those parades.
   ``It was like a big homecoming parade,'' said Bob Murkshe, Cocoa
Beach mayor from 1963 to 1972. ``The astronauts would ride in open
convertibles and people would line the streets and wave flags.
   ``We were all working in the space program then.''
   About 500,000 people watched the launching of Discovery on Sept.
28. The shuttle fleet had been grounded for 32 months since the
January 1986 explosion of the shuttle Challenger, which killed all
seven crew members aboard.

(followed by a "C") and cash incentives manufacturers are offering to dealers
for each car the dealer sells (followed by a "D"). A dollar range means the
cash incentive depends on the number of cars the dealer sells, with the same
targets for all dealers, unless otherwise noted. Reduced-rate financing plans
also are noted. The programs listed are those in effect as of Nov. 1, 1991.

CROOKS PREY ON THE UNWITTING WITH CLONED CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF YIP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a dark side of muscle car collecting. 
</P>
<P>
"As the stakes went up, the crooks came out," explained Corvette aficionado 
Brian Lee, of Mt. Pleasant, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem: unscrupulous sellers and restorers who clone muscle cars 
from standard models and pass them off as original. For example, said Craig 
Jackson of Barrett-Jackson Auction Co., it's all too easy to be stung when 
dealing with 1963-67 Chevrolet Corvettes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the most powerful versions of the 1967 Sting Rays sold for as much 
as $100,000. But experts say there are now more of these Corvettes -- known as 
"tri-powers" because of their three-carburetor induction systems -- on the road 
than were produced by the factory, thanks to the availability of restoration 
parts and the potential for big bucks. In fact, sharp scroungers are turning 
salvage-yard iron into gold, asking as much as $4,000 for correctly dated and 
numbered carburetor setups alone. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a dozen years ago, $4,000 would buy a first-rate, 
original-condition 1967 Corvette convertible, powered by a 427-cubic-inch, 
435-horsepower engine. And that was for a car with "documentation" -- the bill 
of sale, manufacturer's window sticker, factory order sheet, dealership invoice 
and title and service records coveted by hard-core auto collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to verify one of those cars," says Tom Sloe of the 
Corvettes. "They make every piece of documentation now. All they're doing is 
changing the number on the engine to correspond to the (vehicle identification 
number) on the car. 
</P>
<P>
"As collectors we need to band together and turn over to the authorities 
anybody who is committing fraud," said Sloe, a Cleveland-area auto repair shop 
owner who has 25 muscle cars. "That's the biggest thing that will hurt these 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to protect yourself is to become an expert -- read, join car clubs 
and attend car shows, swap meets and nostalgia races -- or hire an expert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to wish a car is what it is claimed. It's also a very good way 
to lose a lot of money," said Robert DeMars, whose Oakland company appraises 
collectible autos and charges a minimum of $470 to appraise a muscle car. JEFF

<HL> GM's 1988 Corvettes, Some Vans Recalled To Fix Faulty Welds </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> GM </CO>

<DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said it is recalling 4,900 1988-model Chevrolet Corvettes for possible faulty construction of their wheels and 460 1987-model GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans because of a possible leak in fuel tank pipes. 

   GM said dealers will inspect the wheel center and rim areas of the Corvettes for faulty welding. 
The Corvettes are all equipped with 17-inch wheels. 
The missing weld could cause the wheel to slip part way off the rim during braking or cornering, resulting in partial loss of steering and a shift in the direction the vehicle is traveling. 

   In the full-size vans, GM said dealers will replace the fuel tank filler pipes because they may have small holes that are also caused by faulty welding. 
The pipe, which allows gas to flow to the fuel tank from a gas station nozzle, may leak during refueling or when the car is turning on a roadway. 
In a crash, fuel spilling as a result of the faulty welds could result in a fire, the company said. 

   GM said it is not aware of any fires resulting from fuel leaks in the vans and said it is also not aware of any injuries or accidents resulting from the problems in either the Corvette or the vans.

<LEADPARA>  The editors of Car and Driver magazine printed the following letter from a
concerned citizen in Angola, Ind.:;    "OK, the year 2000 is closing in on us,
and apparently I'm the only one worrying. I've been concerned since I was a
grade-schooler in the '50s. How are we going to refer to the model year of
cars built in the year 2000? How are ads going to encourage us to buy 2000
Corvette ZR-1s? Will they be referred to as 'oh-oh' Corvettes, or 'zero-zero'
Corvettes or will they be '20 zero-zero' or '20 oh-oh' Corvettes? . . . Yes,
I'm currently on medication for hypertension."  </LEADPARA>

   Just five months after its introduction, General Motors Corp. is raising the price of its 1990 Chevrolet Lumina sedan, the first of a new line of four-door sedans GM is counting on to boost its sagging car-market share. 

   The least expensive Lumina will sell for $12,340, up 3.8% from the original base price of $11,883. 
The base price of the Lumina Euro sedan, which Chevrolet expects to be the more popular version, will rise 3.4% to $14,240 from $13,776 currently. 

   GM appears to be boosting the Lumina prices in step with its prime competitor, the Ford Taurus. 
The 1990 Taurus will start at $12,594, or $254 more than Lumina, and up 6.9% from the 1989 Taurus base price of $11,778. 
But the 1990 Taurus will have a standard driver-side air bag. 
Chevy's Lumina will not. 

   So far, Lumina hasn't set the market on fire. 
At the end of July, dealers had an 82-day supply of the sedans; a 60 to 65-day supply is considered desirable. 
In mid-August, GM sold 2,865 Luminas. 
Ford, by comparison, sold 8,363 Taurus sedans. 

   Meanwhile, Chevrolet set the price for its top-of-the-line image car, the Corvette ZR-1, at $58,995. 
That sticker could make the ZR-1 the most expensive car GM sells, depending on the final price of Cadillac's Allante model. 
The 1989 Allante sells for $57,183. 
Cadillac hasn't announced a final price for the 1990 Allante. 

   Overall, Chevrolet officials said they expect the division to increase its combined U.S. car and truck market share to roughly 20% in the 1990 model year from an estimated 18% for 1989. 

   Chevrolet general manager J.C. Perkins forecast 1990 Chevy sales at about 2.9 million vehicles, including more than 1.4 million trucks. 
That's up from 2.8 million currently estimated for the model year that ends next month. 

   Division marketing executives said the new car advertisements will focus on product and features, rather than image. 

   Truck advertising will accent image, however, with lots of quick shots in one television version of men hard at work in factory settings.

CRAZE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Vintage Cars  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There were Road Runners, Super Bees, Chargers, Barracudas and Challengers
at the Chrysler outlets.;    Ford and Mercury had Torino Talladega GTs,
Montego GTs, Mustangs and Cougars.;    At General Motors, there were GTOs,
442s, Gran Sports, Chevelle Super Sports, Firebirds and Camaros.;    In their
usual trim, these cars were rockets -- capable of 14-second quarter-mile times
on the skinny stock tires of the era.;    But for some discerning buyers, the
base models of these hot rods were not enough. The name of the game was to
out-horsepower your neighbor, and Detroit was only too happy to oblige.;    So
listed on the option sheets were several upgraded engines, all with amazing
amounts of horsepower.;    Chevrolet was particularly astute at playing the
engine-option game, particularly on its Camaros, Corvettes and Chevelles.;   
That the Camaro and the Corvette had many engine options was not surprising --
they were, after all, sports cars designed to appeal to the high-octane
crowd.;    But the Chevelle was, in the beginning, a staid, mid-size passenger
car, targeted at a young family that couldn't afford the full-sized Impala or
Caprice.;    Introduced in 1964, the Chevelle was available in 13 model
choices, ranging from station wagons to four-door sedans to convertibles.;   
Since Detroit was just waking up to the sales power of high-performance
models, the Chevelle was also offered in Super Sport trim.;    Called the
Malibu SS, it came with bucket seats, upgraded vinyl interior trim and a
center transmission console. And when the right option box was checked, a
300-horsepower 327-cubic-inch V-8 was added.;    Two years later, the hot
setup in the Chevelle was the SS-396, a car that epitomized the mid-size
muscle-car craze. The SS-396 was, by all accounts, the best-selling model when
compared to Road Runners, GTOs and the like.;    In base tune, the SS-396
produced 325 horsepower, but power-fiends could order versions that produced
350 and 375 horsepower.;    The SS-396 survived as the top-dog Chevelle until
the 1970 model year, when the largest-displacement Chevy engine ever built --
the 454 -- was offered alongside the standard 396.;    And again, the engine
mavens at Chevrolet obliged the speed crowd by offering two versions of the
SS-454. The base engine, called the LS-5 -- which was its designation on the
order form -- was rated at 425 horsepower.;    The LS-5 was awesome even by
today's standards, but some Chevelle buyers craved more and, they ordered the
454-cubic-inch engine designated as the LS-6.;    Conservatively rated at 450
horsepower, the LS-6 came with solid valve lifters, aluminum cylinder heads,
an aluminum intake manifold and an 11.25:1 compression ratio.;    Available
with either a Turbo Hydramatic or M-22 four-speed transmission, the SS-454 was
put into several thousand Chevelles and El Caminos -- the snazzy pickup truck
derivative of the Chevelle.;    Road tests in 1970 verified that a showroom
stock LS-6 Chevelle could turn the quarter-mile in a few ticks over 13
seconds.;    It was a performance high that would never be duplicated in the
Chevelle, as government regulations, oil embargoes and insurance worries
deflated the horsepower boom in the early 1970s.;    While the SS-396 remains
one of the best-known muscle cars of the 1960s, the SS-454 LS-6 Chevelle is
highly valued by Chevy collectors.  </TEXT>

The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest death rate in crashes, while a four-door 
Volvo has the lowest, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car wrecks for every 
10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United States. It also found that 
the Volvo 740-760 four-door had 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were released by 
the Michigan Assn. of Professional Insurance Agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival when driving a 
larger vehicle," said James Alexander, president of the Michigan association. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates, three were large, six were 
mid-size and only one was a small car -- the Volkswagen Jetta with 1.1 deaths 
per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small, and the other 
three are midsize. Several, including the Corvette at the top of the list, are 
high-performance cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the association, said high-performance cars tend 
to have higher death rates because of the type of drivers they attract. 
</P>
<P>
"The study shows there's a direct correlation between high-performance sports 
models and a higher accident death rate," he said. "The Corvette, Camaro, 
Mustang, Firebird and Dodge Daytona were all in the top 10 in terms of highest 
overall death rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years old," he said. 
"Industry figures show that cars with a higher percentage of female drivers 
tend to have lower death rates." 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of the 1985-87 models with the lowest and the highest death 
rates. The figures in parentheses refer to the number of driver and passenger 
deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
10 Lowest Death Rates -- Volvo 740-760 four-door (0.6), Ford Taurus station 
wagon (0.7), Lincoln Town Car (0.8), Audi 5000 four-door (1.1), Cadillac 
Fleetwood DeVille four-door (1.1), Cadillac Fleetwood DeVille two-door (1.1), 
Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon (1.1), Olds Cutlass Ciera station wagon (1.1), 
Toyota Cressida four-door (1.1) and Volkswagen Jetta four-door (1.1).

   Slow sales are causing General Motors Corp. to extend the model-changeover shutdown at its Chevrolet Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Ky. 

   The plant will return to work the week of Aug. 14 instead of the week of Aug. 7, as originally planned. 
Corvette inventories stood at a 126-day supply on June 30, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication. 

   GM also has shut down plants in Fairfax, Kan., and Doraville, Ga., for two weeks ending Aug. 7, because of parts shortages. 
Both plants recently had reopened after being been closed for several weeks for model changeover and inventory adjustment. 

   Sales have been slow for the Grand Prix cars produced in Fairfax and for the Cutlass Supreme cars produced in Doraville. 
At the end of June, GM had a 131-day supply of Grand Prix cars. 

   Meanwhile, the nine domestic car makers planned to produce 86,851 cars this week, 18% more than the 73,541 cars built a year ago. 
So far this year, the manufacturers have made 4.1 million cars, down about 30,000 cars from last year's levels.

<LEADPARA>  An insurance industry research group has judged the midsized Volvo 240 station
wagon the safest car in America.;    The Chevrolet Corvette had the highest
death rate per 10,000 registered cars, the Insurance Institute for Highway
safety said Tuesday in a report that affirmed the long-standing conclusion of
many researchers that larger cars are safer than smaller cars.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VOLVO JUDGED SAFEST
CORVETTE HAS HIGHEST DEATH RATE, INSTITUTE
SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The institute checked the reported death rates for the 134 most popular
1984-1988 model cars on U.S. roads during the years 1985 through 1989.;    Of
the 14 cars registering the lowest death rates, it said five were large, seven
midsized and only two small. Nine of the 13 cars with the highest death rates
were small, four midsized and none large.;    The institute said death rates
vary not only by size but within car size and body style groups.;    Large
station wagons, large two-door cars and large luxury cars registered the
lowest death rates. The highest death rates were recorded by midsized sports
cars.;    Driver age was also important in determining death rates. The
institute said drivers under 30 tended to have higher death rates.;    And it
said that cars with high percentages of female drivers tended to have lower
death rates than for cars largely driven by men.;    The institute noted that
most models studied were not equipped with automatic seat belts or air bags.; 
  Five of the cars with the highest death rates were Chevrolets.;    "GM long
has known that larger, heavier vehicles fare better in a collision than
smaller ones," said Jack Dinan, a spokesman for the automaker.;    He said
many Chevrolets on the list were involved in single-vehicle accidents "while
being driven by younger males.";    And he said air bags now are installed on
the driver's side of all of the cars listed except the discontinued four-door
Sprint and the discontinued Pontiac Fiero.;    The Corvette got the air bag in
the 1990 model and that the other cars on the risk list received them in the
1991 model year.;    He said there also have been a number of changes in the
drive-ability and strength of the cars on the risk list that would enhance
their safety.;    According to the institute, these are the cars with the
highest death rates, stated as occupant deaths per 10,000 cars.;    The
Chevrolet Corvette Coupe, 4.7; Chevrolet Sprint four-door, 4.5; Chevrolet
Sprint two-door, 4.3; Chevrolet Camaro, 4.3; Ford Mustang, 4.3; Ford Mustang
convertible, 4.0; Nissan 300ZX, 4.0; Yugo two-door, 3.6; Chevrolet Spectrum
two-door, 3.5; Pontiac Fiero, 3.5; Hyundai Excel-Mitsubishi Precis two-door,
3.3; Pontiac Firebird, 3.2; and Ford Escort two-door, 3.1;    The cars with
the lowest death rates were:;    The Volvo 240 station wagon, 0.5; Saab 900
four-door, 0.6; Volkswagen Vanagon, 0.6; Olds Cutlass Cruiser station wagon,

BEHIND THE WHEEL: THE MERCEDES 500SL BUILDS ON YEARS OF ENGINEERING TO LIVE UP 
TO A REPUTATION FOR IMPECCABLE MOTORING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wunderwerke that is this new, strapping, brazenly handsome Mercedes-Benz 
starts from its articulated top and works down. To a single button on the 
console that awaits the lazy pressure of one fingertip. 
</P>
<P>
At that touch, a hidden orchestra of 17 switches, 15 pressure cylinders, 11 
solenoid valves and one electric pump combine in an electro-hydraulic concert 
that opens and closes the 500SL like a two-ton cuckoo clock. 
</P>
<P>
Windows whisper down. A trunk lid flaps. Catches clack. Brackets bend and 
hinges hiss. There is a pause. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fully lined, sail-canvas convertible top slaps up, back and down to 
bury itself in the boot. In finale, the trunk lid flops flat, locking itself, 
and windows slide back up. There hasn't been this much mechanical movement from 
anything so typically German since yesterday's performances of the Glockenspiel 
in Munich's Marienplatz. 
</P>
<P>
And at a long traffic signal in Studio City, a crosswalk trio actually stopped 
to watch and then applaud the Mercedes' 30-second special effect. 
</P>
<P>
Techo-nonsense, maybe. Yet also clear verification of Mercedes' current 
commercials that do not undersell its 1990 duet of heavyweight sports cars (the 
300SL and 500SL) as: "The most passionate statement of engineering leadership 
Mercedes-Benz has ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Heritage and the 500SL's descent from the legendary 1954 300SL Gull Wing coupe 
(currently a more promising short-term investment than stock in IBM) has 
something to do with that engineering edge. So does the car's evolution through 
its 35-year ancestry and the 560SL it now replaces, and its reputation for 
impeccable, implacable motoring. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive? At $83,500 for a two-seater (the same price would buy five Mazda 
Miatas), inordinately so. Over-engineered? More than the first DC-3, which was 
tested by a tractor driving over its wing. Durable? As the Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
But for the essential truth of a Mercedes 500SL, consider another European 
masterpiece, the Rolex watch. It is carved from a solid block of stainless 
steel or gold. It provides a unique heft, a distinctive integrity, a sense of 
total security from the strength of absolute indestructibility. 
</P>
<P>
Bugatti built cars like that in the '30s for decadent owners wanting to assume 
such poise and power. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes still builds a car as if it was carved from a block into a two-ton 
ingot. Then the company peers into tomorrow's promising technology and 
automotive appointments, extracts the best and perfects them for today's 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
That convertible top is magic enough. But the car also has a spring-loaded roll 
bar that is hidden around the inner rim of the rear deck. It snaps upright in a 
30th of a second at critical roll angles. Or if one wheel lifts off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Most cars have power-adjustable side mirrors -- but Mercedes allows adjustment 
of the side mirrors and the interior rear-view mirror by the same button. 
</P>
<P>
Many automobiles have power-controlled seats with memory buttons for several 
drivers -- but Mercedes' memory stores three settings for seats, headrests, 
inside and outside mirrors and positions of the tilt and telescoping steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
A singular pain of convertible motoring is its invitation to pilfering when 
parked with the top down. And the SL -- with seven compartments for the precise 
storage of everything from audio tapes in the center console, through 
sunglasses in a felt-lined dash box to parcels in bins beneath the back seat -- 
is a warren. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the car also comes with central key locking (or an infrared remote control) 
that secures both doors, the trunk, all mini-holds and the fuel filler lid. 
</P>
<P>
Safety in a Mercedes, however, is not confined to threats against your David 
Benoit tapes. 
</P>
<P>
In this new generation SL, it is extended fully to all occupants who, with the 
protection of that automatic roll bar and reinforcement of the windshield 
pillars, are surrounded by a virtual roll cage. 
</P>
<P>
There are driver-side and passenger air bags. Seat belts with instant inertia 
locking are mounted to cast-magnesium seat frames so that adjusting the seat 
does not change the set of the belt. Antilock disc brakes, of course, and that 
over-engineering for a frame and body tough enough to survive a collision with 
the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Externally, the car has lost the angles and edges of previous years, with 
Mercedes' stylists choosing the poised, tiptoe look of a lowered front and 
elevated rear section. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion -- which doubtless will appall purists -- is of a German-built 
Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
In apparent pursuit of aerospace construction that seems to preoccupy many 
manufacturers today, Mercedes has gone to a composite for the aerodynamic skirt 
surrounding the SLs. That might not have been a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Any plastic, even space shuttle, detracts from that substantial, robust Rolex 
image. Worse, the skirt is in a satin finish that forms a definite second-rate 
contrast to the deep, magnificent luster of the metal above. 
</P>
<P>
In thankful contrast, the interior of the 500SL is almost perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Wood actually twinkles, reflecting sunlight and clouds with the top down, and 
the leather has the tactility of a fine brogan. Instruments are large, analog 
and traditional. The seats would serve Malcolm Forbes' ante room, and any 
switch, any lever, works with that soft whisper of hair's-breadth tolerances. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is only one description for the odd symbology and controls of an 
otherwise peerless climate system and an equally super sound system: 
self-explanation achieving the inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
Such nits, however, are nothing once the engine fires and the 500SL's enormous 
V8, with its four overhead cams and 32 valves, starts burbling and 
deep-breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a 322-horsepower left hook. The car carries more punch per liter than 
the thunderous Corvette ZR-1, and that's quite enough to intimidate anything on 
the road save the ZR-1, Ferrari and Lamborghini. 
</P>
<P>
That any convertible can motor with only a hint of frame flex or twitch is 
simply incredible. That any rolling stock this heavy is able to deliver such 
pace and smoothness is a smidge short of miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
This car does not accelerate from stop or even the higher levels of its 
performance range. It explodes. The four-speed automatic is not just silken. It 
shifts and transfers power on diamonds dipped in ermine. 
</P>
<P>
The 500SL moves flat and stolid, and its weight goes virtually nowhere. Not 
even when accelerating briskly around a Cadillac braking desperately for a 
sweeping interchange of the Golden State and Glendale freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike so many other convertibles, wind rush and bulging of the soft top, is no 
part of the SL's progress even when approaching its performance perimeter. That 
limit, incidentally, is close to 170 m.p.h. that even on Germany's Autobahnen 
is electrically governed down to 155 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Suspension is taut on anything but billiard table surfaces (since Proposition 
13, however, these are mainly found in pool halls) because despite its 
opulence, distinction and Teutonic reserve, the SL was always born to be wild 
and sporty. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Mercedes 500SL is the best reason we can think of for East 
Germans to continue moving west. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the high-performance luxury car market is over-dosing on 
comparisons. Prevalent is the debate surrounding Lexus and Infiniti versus 
Mercedes and BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in truth, a non-argument. 
</P>
<P>
Japan does and always will, build its quality cars to rigid budgets. Mercedes 
goes after quality and technological supremacy with little attention to cost. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy doesn't seem to have intruded upon success. 
</P>
<P>
The 500SL goes on sale in Southern California this month, and several dealers 
are reporting 60-customer waiting lists. Order a car now, said a Mercedes 
spokesman, and delivery will be "in excess of a year, at least." 
</P>
<P>
And out-of-state profiteers already are placing Los Angeles advertisements for 
minimal-mileage, used 500SLs. They are asking for $46,500 over list. That's the 
cost of about three more Miatas.

Paul Dean's recent article about the Corvette ZR-1 was of particular interest 
to me because of the "ZR-1's favorite party trick" of going from zero to 100 
m.p.h. and back to a dead stop in 14 seconds. With this capability, the ZR-1 
would be the ideal vehicle for an automated freeway ("For Just $50,000 Leave a 
Ferrari in Your Rear-View Mirror," May 26). 
</P>
<P>
Controlled roadbeds have been discussed for at least 50 years (the 1939 World 
Fair had an exhibit), but never implemented. An automated freeway is based on 
the conclusion that our existing transportation system using independent motor 
vehicles cannot be optimized. For example, we assume that entering vehicles 
will not slow down the system. On-ramps are designed to allow acceleration, yet 
we see vehicles enter at reduced speed. A ZR-1 in an automatic system could be 
directed to accelerate from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in a little over four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway system in Southern California does not now work satisfactorily and 
it is getting worse. Car-pool lanes are only a minor improvement. Why not try a 
controlled ultra-high-speed lane of vehicles with the performance of a ZR-1?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
ordered General Motors Corp. to recall almost half a million 1985
cars and light trucks sold under the Chevrolet, Pontiac and GMC
nameplates, EPA said today.
   The cars exceed federal standards for carbon monoxide exhaust
emissions and for evaporated gasoline, EPA said.
   Such orders are rare and are generally a sign the agency and the
manufacturer could not agree on something, such as the cause of the
problem, its scope, the necessary repair or terms of the recall.
Most recalls are made voluntarily.
   GM's Washington office said the company would have a statement
later.
   The company has 45 days either to request a public hearing to
contest the order, or to submit a repair plan for EPA's approval
before notices are mailed to owners.
   EPA said the affected vehicles are equipped with 5.0-liter (305
cubic inches) and 5.7-liter (350 cubic inches) engines and were
sold as the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic, Camaro, Monte Carlo
and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville, Grand Prix and
Parisienne; and the GMC Caballero. Models sold in California, which
are built to stricter standards, are included.
   The excessive emissions are in part the result of defects in a
thermal vacuum switch in the evaporation control system, EPA said.
But the agency said simple replacement of the switch may not
completely remedy the problem and further repairs, which it did not
specify, may be necessary.
   Last year, GM recalled more than a million vehicles from the
1982 and 1983 model years for similar problems.
   GM also is recalling about 4,900 1988 Chevrolet Corvettes to fix
defective wheel welds that could cause the wheel center to separate
from the rim during braking or cornering.
   The automaker said Wednesday it is also recalling about 460 1987
GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans to correct fuel tank filler pipes
that could cause fuel to leak during refueling or turning.
   No accidents or injuries have been linked to either problem, GM
said. Vehicle owners are being notified of the recall by dealers,
who will correct the problems at no charge, the company said.
   The Corvettes, all equipped with 17-inch wheels, may be missing
a weld on some wheels, GM said. The condition could result in
partial loss of steering control and a sudden changed in vehicle
direction, the automaker said.

<HEAD>Creator Of Corvette Stingray Dies Of Heart Failure</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to include day of death.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William L. Mitchell, creator of
the now-classic Corvette Stingray and a former General Motors
executive, has died of heart failure at the age of 76.
   Ranked as one of the top 10 auto designers of all time by Car
and Driver magazine, Mitchell was a winter resident of North Palm
Beach, Fla. He died Monday in Michigan and was buried Friday in
Bloomfield Hills.
   A vice president of design at GM for 19 years, Mitchell molded
the appearance of hundreds of car models, including the 1963 Buick
Riviera and the 1970 Camaro. His designs were transformed into more
than 72.5 million automobiles, according to GM.
   The Stingray was introduced in 1963, when the Corvette was about
10 years old, and quickly became the dream of sports-car lovers.
   Mitchell told The Post of West Palm Beach, Fla., last year of
the genesis of his idea for a body design that became the
fiberglass-body Stingray.
   ``I bought a Corvette chassis for one dollar,'' he said. ``I
created the Stingray. I wanted it to look like no other car. I
wanted to race.''
   GM officials had stipulated that Mitchell remove all company
logos and keep the car off GM property while he tinkered with it,
Mitchell said.
   He was quick to complain about today's cars.
   ``I don't like the new Corvette,'' he told the newspaper. ``I
think it's very bland. The emblem looks like a cigar wrapper. It
has no classic look.''
   And most new cars ``all look like a bar of soap ... they lack
definition,'' he said.
   Mitchell joined the GM design staff in 1935, and a year later
was promoted to chief designer for the Cadillac Studio. There he
created the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, the first smaller,
personal luxury car.
   He retired from GM in 1965.
   Survivors include his wife Marian, three daughters and four
grandsons.

<P>
ESCAPEE FLEES IN CAR AFTER ASKING SALESMAN TO CHANGE PLACES; HE'S CAUGHT AFTER 
CHASE 
</P>

A prison escapee talked a salesman out of a new Corvette convertible while on a 
test drive Monday and led police on a chase through three cities before he was 
captured trying to run into a Costa Mesa office building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the man was captured, the Corvette was involved in three separate 
collisions involving a total of four cars, but no one was injured, Newport 
Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of grand theft, auto, was James Robert Hruby, 22, who was 
wanted on an arrest warrant for a recent escape from the state prison at Chino, 
Newport Beach Police Lt. Don Chandler said. He said Hruby's driver's license 
indicated that he lived in Mission Viejo before he was sentenced to 2 years in 
state prison on conviction of multiple counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Because syringes and insulin were found on Hruby and he claimed to be a 
diabetic, officers transferred him to the Orange County Jail, where he was 
being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chandler, a man posing as a customer drove a Corvette out of 
MacPherson Chevrolet in Irvine about 4 p.m. with a salesman riding along. A 
short time later, the customer asked the salesman to drive because his foot 
hurt. When the salesman got out of the Corvette to change places, Chandler 
said, the suspect sped away. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't use force or a gun. He just faked the salesman out of the car," 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Officer Kirk Jacobi, who had heard a description of the 
stolen Corvette broadcast over his police radio, first spotted the car on Coast 
Highway near the Rusty Pelican restaurant and followed it while he 
double-checked the suspect's physical description: long, curly blond hair tied 
in a pony tail. The car had paper dealer plates. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobi, a rookie in his first week on patrol, turned on his lights and siren on 
Brookhurst Street just north of the highway, but the driver sped away, Chandler 
said. A Costa Mesa police helicopter entered the chase and officers from 
various cities joined in as its driver traveled back and forth through 
Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was caught, the suspect drove the wrong way on Newport Boulevard, ran 
into four cars and also banged up both sides of the white Corvette as officers 
chased him for 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen Corvette first collided with a car at Adams Avenue and Mesa Verde 
Drive, then hit another car at a filling station at Harbor Boulevard and Adams 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:10 p.m., at the corner of Harbor Boulevard and Sunflower Avenue, the 
Corvette's driver careened into two cars in the parking lot at Digital 
Equipment Corp., where police said the suspect jumped out and tried to run 
inside the office. But employees kept the suspect out by holding the door shut, 
and officers who arrived moments later handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette had a flat right-front tire and damage to a fender. Police did not 
know exactly how many miles the chase covered, but the Corvette's odometer read 
163 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at MacPherson Chevrolet declined to discuss the theft and would only 
estimate the Corvette's value at $35,000 to $40,000.

<HEAD>Oldsmobile Enters Crowded MPV Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lede and final graf to change style on car to multi-purpose

   Oldsmobile entered the crowded multipurpose
vehicle field Wednesday, rolling out its Silhouette multi-purpose
vehicle at Detroit's annual auto show.
   Two other General Motors Corp. subsidiaries _ Chevrolet and
Pontiac _ also unveiled aerodynamic-styled vans for 1990.
   Chevrolet General Manager Bob Burger said meanwhile that Chevy's
new Lumina sedan, which will go into production this spring for the
1990 model year, will be the car upon which GM's future success
depends.
   ``We know that it's going to be a big hit because we've had it
out there among the people who are going to buy it,'' he said.
   William Lane, Oldsmobile General manager, said the Silhouette
utility vehicle will give Olds the chance to capitalize on the
expansion of the market for minivans, started and led by Chrysler
Corp.
   Burger said Chevrolet's Lumina, Oldsmobile's Silhouette, and the
Pontiac Transport SE, which share frame design and windswept
styling, will be built at the GM plant in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   Production during the 1990 model year of the GM minivans is
expected to reach 100,000, rising to 225,000 a year subsequently as
sales rise toward plant capacity.
   Pontiac General Manager Michael Losh predicted the minivan market
would increase to 1 million units in the early 1990s from the
current industry output of about 750,000 units a year.
   Chevrolet and Pontiac share the GM minivan production on a rough
65 percent to 35 percent basis, Burger said.
   Lane declined to speculate on what percentage Oldsmobile would
garner in the new GM production. Burger said the split among
Oldsmobile, Chevrolet and Pontiac would depend on how many vans each
sells.
   Oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business because 1.1
million customers switched from cars to light trucks in 1988, he
said.
   ``Among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market,
34 percent purchased a mid-sized van,'' he said.
   GM's was one of a host of briefings by the 41 exhibitors at the
North American International Automobile Show, where more than 700
cars and trucks are on display.
   GM featured the three multi-purpose vehicles, or MPVs, the Lumina
sedan, the Corvette ZR-1, the Pontiac Stinger and Oldsmobile
Aerotech II. Like other concept cars, the Stinger, a beach-buggy
type vehicle, and the Aerotech II, a four-passenger sports coupe for
the highway, are exhibited for the manufacturer to measure consumer
interest in design and performance characteristics.

SHOTS FIRED AT WEST HILLS COUPLE ON VENTURA FWY.; NEITHER INJURED

A West Hills couple escaped injury early today when their car was hit twice by 
gunshots fired from another vehicle on the westbound Ventura Freeway in 
Woodland Hills, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Rodriguez, 30, and her husband, Alex, 31, were heading home after 
visiting friends about 3 a.m. when they spotted two vehicles apparently racing 
each other near the Shoup Avenue off-ramp, Detective Joel Price said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the vehicles, described as a late-model red Ford Bronco, pulled in front 
of the couple's car and abruptly slowed, Price said. At the same time, the 
second vehicle, a late-model black Chevrolet Corvette, drove up next to the 
driver's side of the Rodriguezes' car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the two cars had boxed in the couple's car, the driver of the Corvette 
began shouting obscenities at Theresa Rodriguez, who was driving, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
As the couple tried to escape by getting off the freeway at Shoup, they saw a 
passenger in the Corvette fire a gun at them, police said. The couple also 
heard what they described as "a pop and a bang," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
The left rear tire began to go flat, and the couple pulled into a gasoline 
station to call police. Investigators found bullet holes in the driver's side 
and in one tire of the car but did not know what kind of gun the assailant 
used, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shots were fired, the two vehicles continued westbound on the freeway 
at high speed. Police said there were two men in each vehicle.

A LITTLE YANKEE INGENUITY GOES OFF TO LE MANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a Cinderella story where even Cinderella looks a little homely. 
</P>
<P>
It involves a rookie racing team without sponsors and a 2-year-old Chevrolet 
Corvette prototype that in a previous life entered nine races, won none and 
regularly finished behind the tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
The car does have a new 900-h.p. engine that cost $40,000. But the motor was 
designed primarily for cabin cruisers and drag racers. It has never been 
installed in a car and has logged fewer test miles than the average lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this unknown, under-financed, untested and certainly baldfaced Eagle 
Performance Racing Team of Santa Barbara is in France anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday it will be America's only entry in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 
toughest ordeal for drivers and machines since Patton pounded through Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we're a low-budget effort and even getting there will be a major 
accomplishment," said team driver Dennis Kazmerowski, 43, of Morristown, N.J., 
before the group flew to Paris. Kazmerowski has been racing cars for 15 years 
but far from the rarefied level of Le Mans. "I think we'll be 20 miles (per 
hour) off the pace . . . our aim is to start the race and be around at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Team founder and co-owner Paul Canary could sing no happier tune. "It's an 
horrendous challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canary, 50, restores collector cars in Santa Barbara and is the only member of 
Eagle Performance Racing who actually has driven the 8.3-mile road circuit at 
Le Mans. "That was in 1981. But we had a French driver who had an accident in 
qualifying and we didn't get to start the race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former drag racer and car designer Joe Schubeck, 52, head of Eagle Engine Co. 
of Westlake Village, built the power plant for the team's recycled Corvette. 
"What we've got here is a dedicated, flag-waving, fired-up, gutsy patriotic 
effort that says 'Born in the U.S.A.,' " Schubeck said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, that doesn't win races. So the object is to keep the car alive 
. . . and if we get close to the end, maybe then we'll be able to kick butt and 
do a little dragging down the straightaways." 
</P>
<P>
Kick derriere at Le Mans? Mon dieu! 
</P>
<P>
For Le Mans is the Indy 500 of Europe and Mardi Gras with croissants. This 
small city of grain and Gothic architecture, 112 miles southwest of Paris, was 
the birthplace of grand prix racing in 1906. It also was the death place for 80 
people in 1955 when a Mercedes rolled and spun into spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Le Mans is a circuit of remorseless extremes varying from the 250-m.p.h. 
Mulsanne straight followed by floor pedal braking for Arnage Corner that must 
be taken at a dawdle. Men have been expendable throughout this daylong ordeal 
because the history of Le Mans is written as periods of domination by 
manufacturers and not drivers: the Bentley years; the Alfa Romeo reign; the 
Jaguar, Ford and Ferrari eras. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar has arrived at this year's Le Mans with four cars, a dozen engines, 
several transporters loaded with parts, 150 helpers, rented helicopters -- and 
a large slice of the $25 million Jaguar annually spends on big sports car 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan is entering seven cars at Le Mans. Toyota, three. Mazda, three. And 
there will be 22 Porsches filling a field of supercars capable of topping 250 
m.p.h. and racing 3,000 miles in one day. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not," noted Canary, "too many out-and-out junkers there." 
</P>
<P>
Le Mans represents million-dollar American drivers who ascended to legend: Dan 
Gurney. Phil Hill. Carroll Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots for Eagle Performance Racing are Canary, Kazmerowski and amateur 
sports car racer Daver Vegher, 30, of San Francisco; all are driving for 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Factory drivers usually arrive at Le Mans by Concorde from New York or private 
jet from Zurich. Members of Eagle Performance Racing booked early on Pan Am 
from LAX to Paris and traveled midweek to qualify for a $600 seat in economy 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entire budget for the car and engines, putting everything together and 
getting everybody to France has been $500,000," said Canary. "We (Canary and 
Santa Barbara business associates Jay Drake and Jim Brucker) raised that by 
selling off a couple of classic race cars . . . a couple of CanAm racers and 
the car that Johnny Rutherford drove to second place in the 1975 Indianapolis 
500." 
</P>
<P>
In world racing, sponsors pay up to $2 million to have their products 
advertised on big-name cars. Goodyear gives tires to its blessed favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodyear wouldn't even sell us tires for Le Mans because they are dealing with 
other entries," said team manager Drake. "We went for Bridgestone and paid full 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"We turned down sponsorship from a soft drink company. They wanted to paste 
their name all over the car for $20,000. We decided we didn't want to sell our 
soul for that." 
</P>
<P>
Discounting all underdog parallels, there is indeed a proud, solid soul to 
Eagle Performance Racing. 
</P>
<P>
The idea began with Canary a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted another shot at the race denied him in 1981, one more opportunity to 
make some small scratch on the history of "the ultimate challenge in sports car 
racing . . . Le Mans, the hardest to win, the most historic, the most 
nostalgic, the most prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the spiritual was the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Canary -- through his Santa Barbara Competition Motorsports -- wants to 
manufacture a limited-edition American supercar. 
</P>
<P>
In his mind, it will be faster than the 200-m.p.h. Ferrari F40 street car that 
goes on sale in the United States this summer and will accelerate quicker than 
the proposed Jaguar 220. It will also be a precise copy and a legal street 
version of the car Canary has taken to Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
"That means a top speed of 250 m.p.h. with a zero-to-100 m.p.h. time of between 
six and seven seconds," Canary explained. "So Le Mans, for us, is an 
opportunity to get some publicity for the car and the engine for when we 
produce copies for street use." 
</P>
<P>
Few cars could be more all-American than Canary's Le Mans car. Although built 
on an aluminum honeycomb chassis developed by Lola, a British firm, the 1988 
car was constructed as a Corvette prototype racer powered by a short block 
Chevrolet V-8. 
</P>
<P>
But in two seasons of American racing, the Corvette GTP fell out of the money 
and short of its promise. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't have enough horsepower," said Drake. "It was a sprint engine, a 
high-compression engine that couldn't last for two or three hours of racing." 
</P>
<P>
Kazmerowski, a Corvette racer, bought the car when it was retired from racing. 
He sold it to Canary, who then went looking for an engine and found Schubeck 
working on a huge and thundering thing of aluminum and steel and double 
overhead cams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a V-8 engine that combines European engine technology with American brute 
horsepower," said Schubeck. "Think of it as a (European) Formula One engine on 
steroids." 
</P>
<P>
It also was an engine that Schubeck -- while developing new techniques for 
cooling cylinders and strengthening the engine block to allow higher horsepower 
-- was designing for dragsters and off-shore cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't matter," said Canary. "What he had was a big, powerful motor 
giving high speed at slow revs (engine revolutions), and 860 h.p at 5,200 revs 
should be ideal for Le Mans." 
</P>
<P>
So the car was built and tested at Willow Springs race track near Rosamond. The 
drivers reported that it ran powerfully, was well balanced and very quick out 
of the turns. 
</P>
<P>
"But, basically, despite working night and day for the past six weeks, we have 
run out of time," continued Drake. "We should have spent more time testing the 
engine. We should have been running with a more rigid chassis, one built for 
this race." 
</P>
<P>
Additional time might have produced a richer, kinder sponsor. More money would 
have purchased backup engines. Yet in such shortages, Drake added, there are 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad to realize that everybody loves a winner only after you have 
won," Drake said. "And that there's no reward for old-fashioned Yankee know-how 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
"But facing that has become about 50% of our incentive. We want to show people 
that hard labor can offset cost and that individual dedication can be worth 
much more than a $2-million race budget." 
</P>
<P>
So Eagle Performance is off to the races in mismatched driving suits and with 
no frills to spare. Canary, Kazmerowski and Vegher will familiarize themselves 
with Le Mans by driving the circuit in a rental van. Their only spare engine is 
one borrowed from Schubeck. 
</P>
<P>
This team cannot possibly win. 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what everyone said when Cameroon trotted out to play 
Argentina in last week's World Cup.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will consolidate
production of most Cadillac models in one factory and launch
a new line of near-luxury models at another as part of a plan
that could mean fewer people building GM's highest-priced
models.
   GM said it expects new Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac
models due out in late 1993 will be popular enough to keep
both its Detroit-Hamtramck, Mich., Cadillac factory and a
plant in Orion Township, Mich., running at full speed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the No. 1 auto maker, which is wrestling to cut excess
capacity, didn't guarantee that 6,000 workers at Orion and
1,000 laid-off employees at Hamtramck all will have jobs
after the new cars are launched. GM is adopting more
efficient manufacturing techniques and simplifying the
designs of its new models in part to reduce the time and
workers needed to assemble them.
   GM said it will shift production of redesigned Cadillac
DeVille and Fleetwood models to the Hamtramck factory from
Orion in late 1993. The Orion factory will get as a
replacement for the Cadillacs a new line of near-luxury Buick
and Oldsmobile cars still under development.
   By agreeing to give the Orion factory a new line of cars
to build, despite a history of labor problems, GM apparently
headed off a confrontation with the United Auto Workers
union. UAW union president Stephen P. Yokich said the moves
create "a potentially difficult situation for several
thousand UAW members," but he didn't indicate any plan to
fight the move.
   Separately, GM said it is recalling 320,000 of its
1987-1988 Chevrolet Corsica/Berettas because the hood could
fly open at highway speeds, blocking the view of the driver.
The defective latch is alleged to have caused five injuries
and one fatality. The car maker switched to a different latch
for its 1989 Corsica/Berettas.
   And it is recalling 250,000 of its 1984-1991 Chevrolet
Corvettes because the seat belts could get stuck in the
retractor, making the belt useless. The problem was a
retractor mechanism part that could break, GM said. This part
has been replaced for the 1992 Corvettes.

   For the first time since the 1970s, automakers
are back in the business of making cars and trucks with a
vengeance, and their offerings for 1989 show it.
   Performance, handling, and wind-cheating styling are required
just to get into the game.
   For 1989, engines are fuel-injected, turbocharged, supercharged,
multivalved or just plain bigger and faster. Many cars have
anti-lock braking, a computerized system that prevents lockup;
advanced suspension systems aimed at a variety of driving tastes;
more responsive four-speed automatic transmissions and styling that
makes the large and small econoboxes of the early 1980s nothing
more than a bad memory.
   Buyers looking for plain, basic transportation can still find
it. But for 1989, the pure pleasure of driving is once again a key
factor in the automotive equation.
   Here are highlights of what's new for 1989:
   GENERAL MOTORS=
   CHEVROLET: Chevy's imports _ the Suzuki-made Sprint minicar,
Isuzu-built Spectrum subcompact and Toyota-GM Nova, along with the
new Suzuki Tracker sport-utility vehicle _ will be sold under the
lineup name Geo at Chevrolet dealerships beginning in 1989. Geo is
the result of Chevy's various attempts to sell imports to buyers
who don't usually shop its dealers. For 1989, the three-cylinder,
50 mpg Sprint becomes the Metro and the Toyota Corolla-based Nova
becomes the Prizm.
   During 1989, Chevrolet will get its first member of the GM-10
midsize car family, a four-door called Lumina. Chevrolet's midsize
Corsica sedan, introduced as a 1988 model, gets a hatch-back
version with fold-down rear seat for 1989. Another option, the LTZ
touring sedan, has a 130-horsepower, 2.8-liter V6 engine and sport
suspension.
   The Cavalier subcompact will be the first car with GM's
so-called ``self-aligning'' steering wheel, which sits on legs that
collapse on impact, flattening the wheel against the driver's torso
to evenly distribute impact force and reduce chest injuries.
   The big 22-year-old, rear-drive 1989 Caprice full-size sedan
comes with a 5.0-liter V8 engine and air conditioning.
   For 1989, Chevy's Corvette sports car gets the most powerful
small-block V8 ever at 5.7 liters, a six-speed manual transmission,
bigger wheels and, on the Z51 performance model, adjustable
suspension. Convertibles will get an optional removable hard-top.
   Like most of its competitors, Chevy's compact S-10 pickup trucks
and Blazer sport-utility vehicles come with standard rear anti-lock
brakes for 1989. Big 4.3-liter, V6 engines are offered on both.
Chevy full-size pickups and Astro rear-wheel-drive compact van also
get rear anti-lock brakes.
   PONTIAC: The Grand Prix coupe, Pontiac's GM10 model, starts the
model year with a 2.8-liter V6 engine, upgraded to a 3.1-liter
engine later in 1989. Air conditioning is standard. Also later,
Pontiac will offer a limited-edition McLaren Turbo Grand Prix, with
a turbocharged 3.1-liter engine and automatic transmission and
anti-lock brakes, both standard.
   Anti-lock brakes also are available on the Pontiac Bonneville
sedan, which has GM's 3.8-liter, 165-horsepower V6 engine on all
versions.
   Pontiac's Grand Am, its best-selling model, is slightly restyled
for 1989. Engine choices, all four-cylinder, include a 2.5-liter, a
turbo-charged 2.0-liter and a 16-valve 2.3-liter.
   For 1989, the 20th anniversary for the Trans Am sports coupe,
Pontiac is offering a limited edition with a turbo 3.8-liter,
250-horsepower engine, automatic four-speed transmission and white
exterior.
   OLDSMOBILE: In mid-1989, Oldsmobile's GM10, the Cutlass Supreme,
also gets the 3.1-liter V6 engine. Anti-lock brakes are standard on
the Trofeo coupe and Touring Sedan and optional on Toronado,
Ninety-Eight and Cutlass Supreme. Oldsmoile also offers
International Series versions of Cutlass Cierra and Cutlass Supreme
and Cutlass Calais, more powerful engines than the base models,
computerized driver information systems and, on the Supreme, a
compact-disc player.
   BUICK: Buick's Riviera coupe and midsize Century are restyled
and Riviera is longer and more graceful. Century gets an optional
3.8-liter V6 engine. Later in the year, Buick moves further upscale
with the Park Avenue Ultra. Ultra will have an all-leather interior
and power front seats. Regal, Buick's GM10, shares the 3.1-liter
engine with its sisters at mid-year and an optional CD player. All
Buick models will have Dynaride suspension, which Buick says is
more responsive while still offering a smooth boulevard ride.
   CADILLAC: ``Bigger is better'' is the motto of GM's luxury-car
division, which has lengthened both the Fleetwood and DeVille for
1989. Allante, the nearly $60,000, Italian-bodied convertible
coupe, has a more powerful 4.5-liter V8 engine, shared with the
rest of the lineup. Allante also has sportier handling and larger
wheels with a self-adjusting suspension system. Other goodies
include a rapid-melt windshield option, personalized remote entry
system and a rear-view mirror that automatically adjusts itself to
glare from other vehicles' headlights.
   FORD=
   FORD: The big news is the sleeker, lower all-new Thunderbird
midsize coupe. The 1989 image model is the Thunderbird Super Coupe,
replacing last year's Turbo Coupe. The Super Coupe is
super-charged, a mechanical system that unlike turbo-charging gives
the engine extra boost at all times rather than only after reaching
highway speed. It also has big, easy-to-read, black-and-white
analog dashboard gauges. The 1989 T-bird has four-wheel independent
suspension, automatic adjustable suspension and a 3.8-liter V6
engine. Options include anti-lock brakes and a compact disc player.

<P>
They are sculptured, expensive, pampered and haughty. 
</P>
<P>
And like all stars attending any international festival, these cosseted cars 
have been arriving by air from around the world for Saturday's premiere of the 
1989 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
From Crewe, England, where it is crafted alongside the Rolls-Royce, came the 
new Bentley Turbo R. The car costs $149,000. The British Airways flight cost a 
mere $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
From West Germany, on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt, came two new cars by 
Bitter. One is a prototype four-door sedan. The other is a production two-door 
convertible. Both are big-ticket and aimed at the consumer who wants a German 
car that isn't seen everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luxury Four-Wheel Drive 
</P>
<P>
From Italy, aboard Alitalia, came the first of the Laforzas, an upmarket, 
$43,000, four-wheel drive vehicle. Its manufacturer is hoping to dethrone the 
British-built Range Rover from its ermine pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
"For nine days we will be spotlighting the products of all manufacturers from 
all countries," said Ben Orloff, manager of the Los Angeles show, which now is 
in its 67th year. "That will translate to 500,000 people examining 650 new 
cars, trucks and vans at a show that's a 500,000-square-foot showroom." 
</P>
<P>
That showroom will also be displaying more first season players than the 
opening day of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti lines -- luxury boats all -- will merge 
approving glances with glazed stares from customers who never thought they'd 
see the day when any Japanese car would cost $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet is introducing the Lumina line, a coupe, a four-door sedan and an APV 
(All-Purpose Vehicle) -- a new family of vehicles for families with children, 
desires for maximum grocery space, multiple entrances and outdoor pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Geo, the new import sales arm of Chevrolet, is out to snare whatever 
entry-level motorists might be left over from Hyundai and Daihatsu with the 
Prizm, a family hatchback expected to sell for less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the high-line cars -- the ones we wouldn't have the gall to drive, 
even if we had the money to buy -- that sell the shows and the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Such as that 140-m.p.h. Bentley Turbo R, once described by David E. Davis Jr., 
publisher of Automobile magazine, as the car that will "replace the Ferrari 
Testarossa and the Lamborghini Countach as the most 'in' car in which bicoastal 
trendies can be seen." 
</P>
<P>
For the purchase price of a Turbo R, you could buy 20 Plymouth Horizons. Eleven 
cows gave leather to upholster the Bentley. Its turbocharger was built by 
Garrett for airplanes. It is the highest combination of elegance and power 
since elephants wore gold saddles. 
</P>
<P>
But who on Earth -- let alone in Beverly Hills -- would want such a car? "Merv 
Griffin, Barbra Streisand, Bijan and Jay Leno all drive Bentleys," a company 
spokesman replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off-Road Luxury 
</P>
<P>
The new Laforza (Italian for "strength") is a rural and off-road luxury vehicle 
-- from leather seats to burled walnut dash and audiophile sound system -- that 
by purpose and $43,000 base price will attempt to give the British-built Range 
Rover (at $35,800) a tug for its 4WD money. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian-American hybrid, the vehicle is powered by a 5-liter Ford engine 
installed in the United States. The rolling chassis, body and interior are 
designed, assembled and shipped by Italian coach builder Pininfarina. 
</P>
<P>
"Range Rover is stately, has heritage, is the queen's choice and is a superb 
vehicle in its class," noted Gene Stinson, senior vice president of Laforza 
Automobiles Inc., of Hayward and Turin, Italy. "But our buyers will be offered 
the aerodynamic look and greater luxury in a vehicle with 40% greater carrying 
capacity, smaller turning circle and a 40% greater towing capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Bitter is back with the Bitter Type 3, a heftier advertising budget and loftier 
marketing ideas, in an attempt to find the California niche it has been 
pursuing since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are going from almost total handcrafting to a car that is 50% 
(machine) production," explained Jim Reilly, general sales manager for Bitter 
Automobile Co. of Santa Monica. "As far as price goes ($47,000), we'll be in 
the mid-range of manufacturers like Mercedes and BMW. But much better 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans make great interiors. But they do tend to be a little vanilla. The 
Bitter has sharp looks on the outside and it's real sexy. The interior will be 
African rosewood and Italian glove leather with a Blaupunkt stereo system so a 
driver can sit in Los Angeles traffic all day and not get bored." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West German Convertible 
</P>
<P>
The Type 3, manufactured in Schwelm, West Germany, is a two-door convertible 
with an in-line, six-cylinder engine by Opel. The car develops 210 horsepower 
and has an estimated top speed of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche will be introducing three new cars to Southern California -- an area 
with a larger Porsche population than all of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Spotlighted on the main turntable will be the Carrera 4, a $69,500 version and 
revision of the venerable 911. This one features all-wheel drive and other 
technological goodies cannibalized from the company's 959 supercar. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche also will be displaying its S2 Cabriolet ($52,600), a convertible 
version of the 944, with a new 3-liter engine; and a new 911 Speedster 
($65,480) attempting to recapture some of the cheeky elan of the bathtub 
Porsches of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen is moving deeper into the power picture with a 140-m.p.h. VW Corrado 
that will replace the Sirocco in the high-performance, small-sedan market. 
</P>
<P>
Audi has a new speed toy for 1989 -- a four-door, V8 sedan also said to be good 
for speeds in excess of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Surprises 
</P>
<P>
High performance, in fact, will be a hallmark of the show. From Ford come the 
Taurus SHO (for Super High Output) and the supercharged Thunderbird SC (for 
Super Coupe). From Mitsubishi comes the turbocharged Eclipse that will also be 
marketed through Chrysler as the Laser. All are sports cars beneath docile duds 
and capable of 140 m.p.h. and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Even the beyond will be represented in Los Angeles -- as Chevrolet unveils, 
nay, uncages its Corvette ZR1, a limited-production, specially engineered, 
heavily armed Top Gun. 
</P>
<P>
This most expensive and fastest Chevrolet ever will go on sale later this year 
for $50,000. Insurance may be almost as much. The ZR1 is a 180 m.p.h. car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Ferrari of the domestics," said Mickey Garrett, executive vice 
president of the Greater Los Angeles Motor Car Dealers Assn., which endorses 
the show. "Buyers are demanding more horsepower -- but from engines that 
provide good fuel economy -- and that trend will be visible at the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there's definitely a return to the luxury car, especially in Southern 
California. The Japanese are seeing the importance of that market and you'll 
see the Nissan Infiniti and the Toyota Lexus in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deepening Affair 
</P>
<P>
To industry officials such as Garrett, automobiles and their pageants are as 
endemic to Southern California as sunshine and sushi. And, he says, the love 
affair is deepening. 
</P>
<P>
"We are predicting that between now and 1994, we will be seeing 50 to 60 new 
(auto manufacturers') nameplates," he said. "Many will be from nations we don't 
really associate with automobile manufacturing -- Yugoslavia, Spain, Australia 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"And where will they be hitting first? California."

   General Motors Corp. on Wednesday recalled about
147,200 cars and vans in five separate actions for problems that
include the possibility of parts breaking in rear suspensions of
some Corvettes.
   The recall included 46,000 1988- and 1989-model Corvettes with
rear-wheel tie rod assemblies that may break, causing a loss of
control.
   GM spokesman Tom Pyden said the automaker wasn't aware of any
deaths or major injuries because of any of the problems.
   The automaker also recalled:
   _About 1,100 1990-model Pontiac Grand Prix SE Turbo cars for
removal of a rear spring heat shield which may puncture the fuel
tank in a collision.
   _About 84,000 1987-89 Chevrolet Corsica sedans because of door
hinge problems which could affect the car's ability to withstand a
side-impact crash.
   _About 10,000 1990 Buick Riviera and Cadillac Eldorado and
Seville cars with potentially sticky rear shoulder safety belt
assemblies.
   _Nearly 6,100 1987-89 Chevrolet and GMC Step Vans built for
commercial delivery for replacement of a seat pedestal which may
not be able to hold the seat or a passenger during a crash.
   GM said owners were being notified by mail. Inspections and
repairs will be performed for free.

   General Motors Corp. executives today rolled out a
new line of multipurpose passenger vehicles for 1990 and for the
first time included an Oldsmobile MPV in its stable.
   William W. Lane, Oldsmobile General manager, said the utility
vehicle will give Olds the chance to capitalize on the growth in the
minivan market. The trend was started and is dominated largely by
Chrysler Corp.
   Chevrolet General Manager Bob Burger said Chevrolet's Lumina,
Oldsmobile's Silhouette, and the Pontiac Transport SE, will be built
at the GM plant in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   Production of the vehicles is expected to reach 100,000 during
the 1990 model year, rising to 225,000 in later years, Burger said.
   Lane said he expects the minivan market to sell 1 million
vehicles a year in the 1990s, compared with 750,000 sold annually
now.
   Chevrolet and Pontiac currently produce minivans and share the GM
production on a rough 65 percent to 35 percent basis, Burger said.
   Lane declined to speculate on what percentage Oldsmobile would
garner in the new production. He predicted most of Oldsmobile sales
would come from crossovers from other manufactuers.
   The GM guiding principle, he said, is ``he who sells them is the
one who earns them,'' meaning that sales dictate the production
split among GM divisions.
   Lane said Oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business
because 1.1 million customers switched from cars to light trucks in
1988.
   ``Among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market,
34 percent purchased a midsized van,'' he said.
   In an elaborate news conference featuring the three MPVs, the
Lumina sedan, the Corvette ZR-1, the Pontiac Stinger concept car and
Oldsmobile's Aerotech II, GM officials said the company is moving
forward quickly in aerodynamic design. It was the first time GM
divisions have shared a news conference to unveil new vehicles.
   The displays were presented at the North American International
Auto Show, which opens to the public Saturday in Detroit. Forty-one
other manufacturers are showing off new models designed to attract a
greater share of the 15 million-vehicle U.S. car and truck market.

   Millions of drivers, young and old,
have dreamed of owning a Corvette in the years since the car was
introduced in 1953.
   That dream came true for Dennis Amodeo _ 36 times over.
   The 33-year-old carpenter from Huntington Station, N.Y., learned
Saturday that he won VH-1's grand prize: one Corvette for each year
the car has been manufactured.
   ``I've always told myself: `Before I die, I'll have one,'''
Amodeo said Monday night at a reception at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
offices in Culver City.
   Amodeo plans to hold on to the Corvette collection, worth an
estimated $1 million, although insurance costs could exceed the
cars' value.
   ``I'd like to try to keep them,'' he said. ``For now, I'll try
to find a way to get them back'' to his home.
   About 2.2 million people entered the contest sponsored by VH-1,
the soft-rock music video cable channel operated by MTV Networks,
said Jim Cahill, a VH-1 executive.
   The success of the contest was due to the enduring popularity of
the Corvette, Cahill said. ``I can't think of another product which
has inspired as many people in the postwar era than the Corvette.''

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- A California jury awarded $6.1 million
to a man who said his injuries in an auto accident resulted
from the defective roof design of General Motors Corp.'s
Chevrolet Corvette.
   On Tuesday, the Contra Costa County Superior Court held GM
liable for most of the injuries suffered by Sherill Smothers,
30 years old, after his Corvette was hit from behind and
flipped over in a 1988 accident. The roof collapsed and Mr.
Smothers's neck was fractured, permanently injuring his
spinal cord.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the Corvette's roof met federal safety
guidelines, the jury found GM 80% responsible for Mr.
Smothers's injuries. Accordingly, GM is liable for $5.5
million of the award. The other driver is responsible for the
remainder.
   Yesterday, GM officials said that the Corvette's roof
wasn't defectively designed and that they will appeal the
jury's decision.

<HEAD>Car Thieves Prefer Camaros, Corvettes And Porsches, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car thieves like sporty special models and in
some cases they're interested in only the radio, says an insurance
industry study. The cars safest from theft are small- and mid-sized
domestics, especially station wagons.
   A report by the Highway Loss Data Institute said Thursday that
the likelihood of theft ranges widely among cars and that the most
frequent targets are Volkswagens where the radio is easy to steal
and is a powerful lure.
   A study of 1985-87 model cars found seven Volkswagens among the
11 car models with the highest rate of theft claims. All 11 cars
were imports, and in many cases thieves were only interested in the
radios, said the report.
   The radios ``are easily accessible,'' said Rick Elder, vice
president of the insurance group, in an interview. ``You can snap
them out of one car and easily put them into another. It's a very
attractive theft target.''
   But when thieves are out to steal an entire car they are likely
to pick expensive sporty models, including a number of U.S. cars,
the study concluded. High on the list is the Porsche 911 Coupe,
followed by the Chevrolet Corvette and the Chevrolet Camaro, the
report said.
   It said sports and speciality cars continued to account ``for an
overwhelming share of total theft losses.'' While these cars
account for about 15 percent of the total number of cars insured,
they represent 40 percent of the dollars paid on insurance claims
because of theft.
   The least likely cars to be stolen or broken into are small and
mid-sized domestic models, led by the Mercury Lynx, said the
insurance group.
   According to the report, the Volkwagen GTI, which had the
highest theft rate, was nearly 70 times as likely to be the target
of a thief as the Lynx.
   Other cars with little interest from thieves, according to the
study, were the Mercury Grand Marquis station wagon and Mercury
Topaz, the Plymouth Colt Vista wagon and Pontiac Sunbird wagon.
   The study covered 1985-87 models.
   Among vans, pickup trucks and utility vehicles, the 1985 Jeep
CJ-7 and the 1986 and 1987 Suzuki Samurai had the highest
likelihood for theft. Small pickup trucks generally had the lowest
theft rate.
   Some cars lost the interest of thieves after their design
changed or in some cases security devices were installed, the
report said. For example the theft rate for the Chevrolet Corvette
declined somewhat after new security system was put in the 1986
model.
   But it said design changes in the Mazda RX-7 and Toyota Celica
resulted in sharply lower theft losses in 1986 and 1987. Elder
attributed the decline to thieves not having a market for the newly
designed parts.
   ``The demand for the stolen parts hasn't built up,'' he
suggested.
   Meanwhile, theft losses for the Buick Regal and Chevrolet Monte
Carlo, both of which adopted a more sporty look in 1987, increased
sharply that year, the report said.
   The report tracked theft losses during the first year of
availability for the 1987 models cars, the first two years of
availability for 1986 models and the first three years of
availability for 1985 models.
   The Highway Loss Data Institute, which is part of the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, gathers and processes a broad range
of insurance statistical data.

The cars were moving off the showroom floor at Security Chevrolet in Vista like 
hot cakes, faster than anything sales manager John Quinn had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, nobody was buying them. In a heated rush, salesmen were driving 
spanking-new cars -- and even pushing one vintage model -- to save them from a 
fire that struck the East Vista Way dealership early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze erupted about 9:40 a.m. in a faulty light fixture in the showroom 
ceiling. A salesman heard a couple of weird popping noises. Then, "Blam!" Quinn 
recalled, the ceiling was a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the small showroom was an $11,000 Geo Storm as well as a much more 
valuable vehicle that the dealership had placed on display: a 1956 Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
The car was the prize awarded to the relative of a local resident 34 years ago 
for dreaming up what was to become a famous advertising slogan: "See the U.S.A. 
in Your Chevrolet." 
</P>
<P>
As sparks and pieces of the burning ceiling began falling, the salesmen knew 
they had to move the valuable cars or watch them burn, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
But first they had to move five autos that blocked their way, parked on a porch 
outside the showroom -- including a $37,000 Corvette directly in their path. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into the office and looked in the drawer where we keep the keys to the 
Corvette," Quinn recalled. "They're in a special place because of the value of 
the car. And when I looked, they weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the heat of the moment and I was fishing around the drawer like a 
madman. Finally, my fingers found them." 
</P>
<P>
After moving the Corvette, the salesman rescued the silver and white '56 Chevy 
that the late Albert Merrill of Boston had won for his winning slogan. They 
shoved the car from the blackened showroom without so much as a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to go back inside and push it because we didn't have the keys," Quinn 
said. "The embers were falling, and right after we got the car out, the ceiling 
really started to drop. The only thing that was on our minds was to get the 
hell out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Osce (Tex) Gross, 84, of Vista, whose wife was related to Merrill, said he went 
by the dealership Sunday and was "glad to see the car was still alive." 
</P>
<P>
"That car really means something to this family," he said. "It's a V-8, 
four-door with original upholstery. Everyone who sees that car wants to buy it, 
it's just that special." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said Merrill, his wife's uncle and a bank treasurer in Boston, was the 
kind of man who liked to enter contests and had a way with words. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how he came up with the winning jingle," Gross said. "And Chevy went 
right to the bank with it. You used to hear it on television all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The car stayed in the family after Merrill died several years ago at age 98, 
Gross said. After refurbishing it, Gross and his wife gave the car to their son 
Fred, who runs a Vista insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
While the salesmen said they were glad to have been able to rescue the cars, 
the showroom didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the fire caused about $300,000 damage to the building and 
contents, a figure they said was substantially reduced by the quick actions of 
the salesmen in moving the cars. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived at the fire, they found smoke pouring from the 
showroom and flames flicking from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The firemen were able to protect our office and 99% of our records," said 
Randy Hollingsworth, general sales manager of the 22-year-old dealership. 
"Without our records, we would have been a crippled business." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, yellow Fire Department tape surrounded the empty showroom. But the 
salesmen at Security Chevrolet were still on hand to do what they do best -- 
sell cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, let's take a look at this little V-6 right here in the corner," one 
salesman said, leading a would-be customer by the arm. "It's a real beaut." 
</P>
<P>
Hollingsworth said the dealership was business as usual. "If you want to buy a 
car," he said, "we're opened for business." 
</P>
<P>
The boys on the lot, however, didn't sell any cars at all on Saturday or 
Sunday. But car salesmen are resourceful, Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll have us a little fire sale," he quipped. "That's a real incentive 
for the salesmen. Because if they don't get any sales, they get fired."
