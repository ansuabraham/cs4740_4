   With something as simple as a greeting
card, Truesillia Ruth Shank hopes to help bridge the gap between
the worlds of the sighted and the blind.
   ``It seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the
simple, little pleasures of life,'' said Mrs. Shank, sitting in the
living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her
7-month-old card company, Sucurre Greetings. Sucurre is an Old
French word meaning ``to assist.''
   ``Can you imagine being 30, 40 or 50 years old and having to
wait for someone to read a stack of Christmas cards to you? Or not
being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for
your wife or a birthday card for your child?'' she asked.
   The inspiration for Sucurre Greetings, which Mrs. Shank owns
with her husband, came while she was working on an advertising
project with a blind businessman.
   ``He was doing things I couldn't do even with my sight,'' she
said. ``It just didn't seem right that he needed someone to go to a
store with him just to pick out a card.''
   Because of the limited market, Braille greeting cards have not
been manufactured by established card companies, said Adam Ash,
publisher of the Gift Reporter, a trade publication for the gift
industry. Some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some
Braille cards at Christmas, and others translate greeting cards to
Braille when requested.
   ``At best, what you've been able to get up until now is a card
for a sighted person that's been Brailled. These cards are designed
specifically for a visually impaired person, but are still
appealing to a sighted person as well,'' said Paul Ponchillia, a
professor in the Department of Blind Rehabilitation at Western
Michigan University.
   Ponchillia, who is blind, helped the Shanks design the cards.
   The Shanks, also co-owners of a year-old advertising and
printing company, hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant
designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide
audience. Underneath the design is a description of the object in
Braille. Inside, Braille appears under the message, typically a
short phrase with slightly raised letters.
   One lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover.
Inside, the message is ``My heart's all a-flutter.''
   In addition to her basic line of 25 cards, Mrs. Shank said she
also has a line of Christmas cards.
   ``We want the person to get the full impact of the card _ a card
that everyone can enjoy,'' said Mrs. Shank, a bubbly, 32-year-old
mother of three.
   She does the embossing by hand. Her husband, Michael, art
director at a television station, does much of the designing and
printing. Most of the Brailling is done by blind volunteers.
   Distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops,
but Mrs. Shank says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up
distributors for the cards in other parts of the country. The cards
sell for $2 and $2.50 locally.
   If the cards catch on, the Shanks would like to provide jobs for
blind rehabilitation and training groups.
   And it looks as if the cards may be catching on. Marshall Field
has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of
department stores, as well as an alphabet book Mrs. Shank designed
for use by both sighted and blind children.
   ``Before getting involved in this, I never really knew a blind
person and I don't think I ever remember seeing a book that's shown
me what Braille's like,'' she said.
   ``We planned the book to get rid of the gap between sighted and
blind children. We want a sighted child to know what Braille feels
like and a blind child to be able to feel the letters that we're
seeing. Maybe that way we can get rid of some of the prejudice.''
   Prejudice is a subject Mrs. Shank knows well.
   ``Because I'm black, some people might ask why I'm not doing
something for a black cause. Well, blindness knows no color. When
people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped
people, maybe they'll stop being prejudiced about black people,''
she said.

<HL> Net at American
Greetings Dropped
82% in 2nd Period

   American Greetings Corp., hurt by competitive pricing as it seeks to snare market share from other greeting card makers, reported that profit in the fiscal second quarter plunged 82%. 

   Despite a 10% rise in revenue, net income in the quarter ended Aug. 31 slid to $832,000, or three cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $250.2 million from $226.8 million. 

   "Without question, our earnings decline was greater than we had expected," said Morry Weiss, president. 
He also said it is "doubtful" that profit in the year ending Feb. 28 will exceed year-earlier net income of $63.4 million, or $1.97 a share, as predicted by the company earlier this year. 
Fiscal 1987 revenue was $1.13 billion. 
Mr. Weiss didn't make a specific earnings forecast. 

   For the past several quarters, American Greetings -- the country's largest publicly traded greeting card maker -- has been embroiled in an intense fight for market share with major competitors, such as Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings Inc. and Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark Cards Inc., which is closely held. 
According to an analyst report from Neuberger &amp; Berman, New York, Hallmark holds about 40% of the greeting card market, followed by American Greetings with 35% and Gibson Greetings with 9%. 

   An American Greetings spokesman noted that the company recently won a national drugstore account away from Gibson but that overall the market share battle has resulted in a draw. 

   Nonetheless, E. Gray Glass III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., predicts "the competitive battle among the big three will continue." 
Most retail outlets, he said, already sell greeting cards, and therefore the "only way to grow is to take away market share" from competitors. 
Ultimately, smaller card makers probably will be forced to close, he predicted. 

   American Greetings signaled it might favor a cease-fire in the pricing war, saying that relationships between retailers and suppliers are being hurt along with profits. 
"The futility of continued profitdraining competitive activity should now be apparent," Mr. Weiss said. 

   Ward A. Cavanaugh, Gibson Greetings' chief financial officer, said the company has been getting "mixed signals" on whether pressure on pricing is easing. 
"We hope it abates," he said. 
Mr. Cavanaugh said the company doesn't comment on accounts won or lost. 

   Mr. Weiss said profit in the fiscal second quarter was pinched by higher-than-expected returns of seasonal merchandise, weaker-than-anticipated sales of such non-greeting card product lines as gift wrap, and increased interest expense on higher borrowing levels. 

   American Greetings said sales of everyday greeting cards have improved, "perhaps signaling an upturn in the poor retail environment" that has been hurting profit. 
Beginning with this year's Christmas program, American Greetings said it will reduce seasonal shipments, among other things. 

   The company said it will review options "for dealing with underperforming noncard business" and also said it has reduced costs by eliminating 127 positions last month, mostly at corporate headquarters. 
A company spokesman said further staff reductions aren't planned. 

   In national over-the-counter trading, American Greetings stock closed yesterday at $24.875 a share, down $1.50. 

   In the fiscal first half, the company earned $14.4 million, or 45 cents a share, down 33% from the year-earlier $21.7 million, or 67 cents a share. 
Revenue rose about 9% to $513.5 million from $470.6 million.

   American Greetings Says Estimates
   Of 4th-Quarter Earnings Are on Target

   CLEVELAND -- American Greetings Corp. officials said they
are comfortable with analysts' estimates that net income for
its fourth quarter, ended Feb. 28, will be about $22 million,
or 70 cents a share, up from $18.9 million, or 59 cents a
share, for the year-earlier period.
   "I have no problem with that estimate," said Henry
Lowenthal, chief financial officer for American Greetings,
the No. 2 greeting card maker behind closely held Hallmark
Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That would bring earnings for the year to $94 million, or
$2.60 a share, compared with net of $72.2 million, or $2.25 a
share, last year. Revenue this year will be in excess of $1.4
billion, Mr. Lowenthal said in an interview, compared with
year-earlier revenue of $1.31 billion.
   Mr. Lowenthal said he is confident that American Greetings
can maintain the 9% revenue growth achieved in the first nine
months of fiscal 1991. He cited the company's strong position
in the growing mass retail market and its limited exposure to
the specialty market, which is shrinking.
   For fiscal 1992, Mr. Lowenthal said he is comfortable with
the lower end of analysts' earnings estimates, which range
from $2.90 to $3 a share.
   The company's president and chief executive officer, Morry
Weiss, said this year's earnings were boosted by the
recession-typically a good climate for the industry because
consumers who can't afford gifts send cards instead.
   Demand was so strong that American Greetings has
successfully increased prices by an average of 7% to 8% over
last year, Mr. Weiss said. "It's taking place because the
consumer is opting for it," he said, explaining: "During a
recession, higher-priced cards sell better because they often
do not accompany a gift."
   Surprisingly robust Valentine's Day sales also helped
increase earnings, he said. "As good as Christmas was,
Valentine's Day was outstanding." The war may have helped
out. "During a war people are much more sentimental," he
said.
   The company's "Treasured Original" $100 Valentine's Day
cards -- framed oil paintings done by hand -- inspired
consumers to buy more $2.50 and $5 cards, Mr. Weiss said. All
2,000 of the Treasured Originals were sold to retailers, who
can't return them. However, any unsold cards can still be
marketed because the cards' verse is also appropriate for
Mother's Day and love in general, American Greetings said.
   Mr. Weiss declined to say how much of the increased
earnings were due to price increases vs. sales volume. But he
said sales "outperformed" the company's expectations.
   The Persian Gulf war brought other good news for American
Greetings. In an attempt to promote its brand name, the
company produced two new lines: "America Misses You" cards to
be sent to the Gulf and "Greetings from the Gulf" to be sent
home. Unlike most of the company's new card lines, which
require production time of 12 to 15 months, the war cards
were produced in three weeks, Mr. Weiss said.
   In light of that accomplishment, American Greetings will
try to cut its time to market so it can respond quickly to
trends. "We're looking for a 30% reduction," by 12 to 18
months from now, Mr. Weiss said.
   Mr. Weiss said the company will continue to expand its
best-selling "anytime" greeting cards, such as its Couples
lines, targeted at people in love relationships. This year,
two more "anytime" card lines will be introduced, this time
targeted around family relationships and friendships, Mr.
Weiss said.
   National Wildlife Cards -- nature theme cards with
traditional greetings printed on recycled paper -- were
shipped to retailers two weeks ago. It's too early to tell
how well they're selling, Mr. Weiss said.
   American Greetings is pleased with its 1.5 million share,
or 40% stake in Artistic Greetings, which markets cards by
catalog, Mr. Weiss said. American Greetings bought the stake
at $4.30 a share in April 1990. Since then the value of the
shares has shot up. Revenue for the equity stake will total
about $1 million for fiscal 1991 and will be reflected in
year-end earnings, Mr. Lowenthal said.
   American Greetings has the option to buy all of Artistic
through March 1992. Mr. Weiss said he expects to decide in
the next "12 to 18 months," explaining that he can extend the
March deadline.
   American Greetings' biggest challenge will be to create
greeting card shops within mass retailer stores, where
consumers shop "as a matter of choice, not just convenience,"
Mr. Weiss said.

<HL> American Greetings Profit Plunged 95% In Fiscal 4th Period Due to Competition </HL>

   American Greetings Corp. reported that profit for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 29 dropped 95% to a scant $748,000, or two cents a share, mainly because of extremely tough competition in the greeting card industry. 

   Morry Weiss, president and chief executive officer, said at a news conference that there are indications in the past few months that the three major greeting card makers are becoming a little less aggressive in trying to win retailers away from one another, but that it is too early to forecast a significant profit upturn. 
Hallmark Cards Inc., Kansas City, Mo.; American Greetings; and Gibson Greetings Corp., Cincinnati, together produce about 85% of the greeting cards sold in the U.S., Mr. Weiss said. 

   In year-earlier quarter, American Greetings earned $15.4 million, or 48 cents a share. 
Sales for the latest quarter rose 8% to $314.5 million from $291.2 million a year earlier, mainly because sales of newly consolidated subsidiaries were included in the 1988 period. 

   For the fiscal year, net income fell 47% to $33.4 million, or $1.04 a share, from $63.4 million, or $1.97 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 6.5% to $1.20 billion from $1.13 billion. 

   Mr. Weiss said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the profit outlook. 
However, he said he was "more optimistic than the record would suggest I should have been" a year ago, and declined to make an earnings forecast. 
A year ago, officials said profit would rise in fiscal 1988. 

   For both the quarter and the year, American Greetings had higher than normal returns of seasonal merchandise and a decline in profit from its toy division and foreign subsidiaries, Mr. Weiss said. 
He said the company is considering dropping out of toy production and distribution, but hasn't put its AmToy Inc. subsidiary on the block. 
Even if the company halted toy production, it would continue to license other companies to produce American Greetings-designed toys, he said. 

   Analysts said they weren't surprised by the poor showing in the fourth quarter because management signaled in January that competition was eating away gross profit margins. 
Several analysts said they expect a profit increase in fiscal 1989, but they don't expect net to recover to the levels of the 1984-87 period when net ranged from $1.91 a share to $2.35 a share. 

   "We're still going to see the major players battle to maintain market share, and gross margins will continue at about the current depressed levels," said Charles E. Cerankosky, who follows American Greetings for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, Cleveland. 
Major retailers have become very good at playing competing manufacturers against one another to obtain free display fixtures, cooperative advertising, extended payment terms and other concessions, as well as price discounts, he said. 

   Mr. Cerankosky estimates that the company will earn $1.20 a share in the current year. 
Some other analysts said they estimate current year net at $1.50 a share. 

   Mr. Weiss said American Greetings defended its market share last year, "but at a very dear price." 
He said the company will continue to "maintain our market share as a critical element of our strategy." 
The company expects to use its position in retail stores to sell other items besides greeting cards, he said. 
Already the company is selling picture frames, he said. 

   American Greetings reduced shipments of seasonal cards in recent months, which it expects will also cut the number of cards returned by retailers, Mr. Weiss said. 
However, for the latest quarter and year, sales were reduced both by the lower shipments and the higher returns, which are subtracted to produce a net sales figure.

<HL> Card Makers' Tough Tactics Belie
Sweet Verse as Competition Rises

   Their verses may be perky and sweet, but behind the lines, the nation's three major greeting-card makers are waging a nasty, and costly, battle. 

   "It's like a military situation," says Benjamin J. Sottile, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who has been on the attack since joining Gibson Greetings Inc. as president a year ago. 
"Cards are a mature industry, and the only way you can grow is at the expense of competitors." 

   Although Americans buy seven billion cards annually -- nearly 30 apiece -- growth in the $4 billion-a-year industry has stagnated. 
And the industry -- after introducing cards for everything from grandparents' day to Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in recent years -- has practically exhausted occasions to celebrate. 

   So far, the three largest card makers have battled to a stalemate. 
Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark Cards Inc., with 40% of the market, is still the industry leader. 
American Greetings Corp. of Cleveland is No. 2, with a 35% market share, and Cincinnati-based Gibson is third with 11%. 
About 300 small card companies account for the rest. 

   As the Big Three try to carve into each other's market share, their tactics have gotten brutal and their profit margins have plunged. 
They raid each other's major retail accounts and forage into each other's product niches. 
Smaller card companies accuse the giants of pillaging their best ideas. 

   To woo major accounts, the card makers are forking over more and more of their profits to retailers -- and accounts shuffle back and forth, often to the highest bidder. 
"We pay the chains to keep our cards there," says Morty Wyman, vice chairman of the directors' executive committee at American Greetings. 

   Although American Greetings and other card makers refuse to say how much they pay to win the loyalty of retailers, a lawsuit filed by Gibson against a national drugstore chain provides some insight into the rivalry. 
In the suit, filed in August in Cincinnati's county court, Gibson claims Revco D.S. Inc. repudiated its agreement with the card maker after American Greetings made special concessions to the retailer. 
The suit says American Greetings made the concessions this year to win back half of the 2,000-store account it had lost to Gibson. 
American Greetings wasn't accused of any wrongdoing. 

   Gibson says it spent more than $5 million installing new racks in about 500 Revco drugstores, with the understanding that it would supply 1,000 Revco stores for five years. 
Gibson contends that Revco, after asking Gibson to make a proposal to supply all the chain's stores, suddenly picked American Greetings as its sole supplier. 
In the suit, Gibson is seeking $27.5 million for, among other things, damages and reimbursement for the money it spent on the racks. 

   Revco denies the allegations. 
"It is not uncommon, as a result of normal competitive processes, to find these or other greeting-card manufacturers displacing one another in various retail outlets throughout the nation," the company says. 

   The card makers also are waging an expensive battle for the accounts of specialty-card stores and gift shops -- one of the market's few bright spots. 
Such stores, previously Hallmark's bastion, continue to grow in number, while card makers believe they have saturated the mass-merchandiser market. 

   Such stores account for at least a third of all card sales, says Morry Weiss, American Greetings chief executive. 
Although American Greetings has mainly supplied drugstores, discount stores and other chain outlets, it now is making a big push to expand into specialty stores. 
"I can't walk away from that market," he adds. 

   The card makers' biggest battlefield, however, is in the market for so-called alternative cards -- known for their satirical or inspirational messages and usually not pegged to a particular holiday or event. 
Alternative cards -- now the industry's hottest sellers and still growing -- represent between 17% and 22% of all cards sold. 

   The Big Three are making their gains in the alternative card market largely at the expense of tiny competitors, who were successful early on in offering such lines. 
The major card companies didn't get into the market until last year. 

   The alternative cards appeal largely to baby boomers; the companies say many young adults enjoy sending humorous cards to friends for no particular occasion or holiday, but just to stay in touch. 
Many of the alternative lines also are geared toward women, who buy 90% of all cards. 
Gibson, for example, offers a line called Women's Writes. 

   Of the major companies, Hallmark generated the most controversy with its alternative-card entry. 
In the largest rollout of new cards in the company's history, it brought out the "Shoebox" line, aimed mainly at women, and "Personal Touch," a line of sentimental cards. 

   Soon after the unveiling, suits were filed accusing the industry leader of buying up competitors' cards and then restocking shelves with Hallmark cards that closely resembled those that were pulled. 

   In a suit seeking damages of $50 million, Blue Mountain Arts Inc., a Boulder, Colo.-based company known for its watercolor designs and sentimental verse, accused Hallmark of copying its cards, among other things. 
In November 1986 in federal court in Denver, Judge Jim R. Carrigan issued a preliminary injunction against Hallmark, halting distribution of 83 cards that the court determined had been copied from Blue Mountain. 

   Hallmark denies the allegations and has appealed the preliminary injunction. 
A trial date hasn't been set for the suit. 

   In July, in amending the suit, Blue Mountain claimed Hallmark "pressured" greeting-card dealers to pull Blue Mountain cards from their shelves "as a condition of being allowed to continue a beneficial business relationship with Hallmark." 
Blue Mountain also alleged that Hallmark leases shopping-center stores only to dealers who pledge they won't sell Blue Mountain cards, and that Hallmark bought up and destroyed the smaller company's cards at various stores. 

   Hallmark denies the allegations in the amended suit as well, a company spokeswoman says. 
She says the company does have a program of giving dealers credit for "obsolete" cards made by Hallmark or any other company, but that dealers aren't obligated to accept the credit. 
She says "a large percentage" of Hallmark trade-name stores and independent dealers carry competing brands, including Blue Mountain at some stores.

unit. Defying recessionary reports of penny-pinching, the
greeting-card company is offering Treasured Originals --
framed, 17-inch by 21-inch oil paintings of pink and red
roses, which open to one of four assorted love verses fresh
from the company's data base of romantic rhymes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What better way to say `I love you' than with the world's
most exclusive greeting card?" Carlton bubbles in a news
release.
   Having planned the new line before the invasion of Kuwait,
the Cleveland-based company says the cards can sell well
despite economic turbulence prompted by war fears.
   "Love doesn't seem to be daunted by those things," says
Mary Ann Corrigan-Davis, a Carlton vice president.
   Research shows that shoppers are willing to dish out more
for Valentine's Day cards than for cards on other occasions,
she says. American Greetings' ordinary valentines cost $1.75
to $2, while greeting cards for other occasions average
$1.40.
   As for the leap from $2 to triple digits, Ms.
Corrigan-Davis says, "It's not unusual to spend over $100 on
dinner and flowers. And a Treasured Original is a lasting
gift."
   The company ordered 4,000 cards from its painters in the
Orient and says it's already shipped some to distributors.
The profit margins on Treasured Originals are considerably
lower than on high-volume paper cards, Ms. Corrigan-Davis
says, but American Greetings will recoup its investment.
   Some analysts say the costly cards may help establish
American Greetings as a trend setter. Others, however, are
dubious. "It's an extreme extravagance," says Sheldon Grodsky
of Kenneth, Jerome &amp; Co. in Florham Park, N.J. "I thought
that went out with the '80s." He predicts American Greetings,
the No. 2 card maker behind Hallmark Co., "won't tap the mass
market with this one."
   What do women think? Sally L. Schaadt, an analyst at
Fourteen Research Inc., an equity research firm in New York,
says she doesn't care what she gets on Valentine's Day, "as
long as I get something." But she says she'd probably rather
be wined and dined by candlelight than handed a Treasured
Original.

HOLIDAY CARDS PUT EXTRA EMPHASIS ON PEACE

<P>
With thousands of soldiers encamped in the deserts of the Middle East, peace on 
Earth may be too much to wish for this holiday season, but there's good reason 
to expect peace in your mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Greeting card industry officials and analysts say holiday cards bearing peace 
wishes will sell briskly this holiday season, reflecting consumer concerns 
about the state of the world and events in the Persian Gulf in particular. 
</P>
<P>
And although the sputtering economy is expected to bring a not-so-merry 
Christmas for the nation's big retailers, sales of greeting cards should buck 
that trend, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"When times are tough, people cut back on buying expensive gifts and buy more 
expensive cards," said analyst Kendrick Noble at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeting Card Assn., an industry group based in Washington, estimates that 
2.3 billion cards will be purchased this holiday season, up from 2.2 billion in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But for the full year, consumers will spend $4.6 billion on 7.3 billion 
greeting cards, up nearly 10% from $4.2 billion last year, the association 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a pretty tough Christmas," said Kevin Moore at Ohio Co. "But 
on the other hand, greeting cards are a lower-priced kind of purchase and 
generally more of an impulse purchase." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Riviere, a spokeswoman for the trade group, said card sales overall have 
grown steadily for years. They totaled $2.1 billion in 1980, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is by far the leading card-sending holiday, said Riviere. Valentine's 
Day and Easter are second and third, respectively, followed by Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to peace theme cards, the environment is another theme likely to 
dominate this season and throughout the 1990s, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a consumer preference for peace-themed items, such as doves, a 
reflection of people's concern over the world situation," said Steve Doyle of 
Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., the nation's largest greeting card 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Riviere said many manufacturers are jumping on the environmental bandwagon by 
planning cards made of recycled paper or linking their products to 
environmentally friendly organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are being pushed by consumers to have a green ideology in all their 
products," said Jody Roberts, marketing coordinator at Cleveland-based American 
Greetings Inc., the No. 2 manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said American Greetings plans a complete environmental line of boxed 
cards for Christmas, 1991, and will introduce a line linked to the National 
Wildlife Federation before Father's Day next June. 
</P>
<P>
Other growing categories in the industry are cards that reflect changing social 
realities -- "Merry Christmas, Stepfather" is one example -- and cards, 
particularly those with humorous messages, designed to appeal to younger 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The average family sends a total of 44 Christmas cards, according to the group, 
37 of them from boxed sets and seven that are purchased individually. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 companies make greeting cards in the United States. But the three 
largest generate 80% of the sales, the association estimates. Gibson Greetings 
Inc., based in Cincinnati, is third behind Hallmark and American Greetings.

   In the fiercely competitive greeting card
industry, Among Friends is a grain of sand on a beach dominated by
giants like Hallmark Cards, American Greetings and Gibson
Greetings.
   But the alternative card company, which was formed two years ago
by three women in this Lake of the Ozarks community in central
Missouri, has set some lofty goals.
   ``People say, `Oh, is your goal to have Hallmark buy you out?' I
say, `no, our goal is to buy Hallmark,' '' Claudia Parrish, one of
the company's founders, said with a poker face.
   She quickly breaks into a smile and laughs at the thought of the
tiny, anonymous firm gobbling up Hallmark, the industry leader,
which reportedly notched $1.25 billion in greeting card sales last
year.
   But Parrish and her partners, Roxie Kelly and Shelly
Reeves-Smith, are serious about carving their own niche in a market
ruled by huge corporations.
   In just a couple of years, Among Friends has expanded from
selling a few cards in local shops to marketing a line of 36
all-occasion cards, gift tags, decorative bags and a
card-organizing notebook in 48 states, Japan and England. The
company is working to expand that line.
   Parrish, the company's business manager, says Among Friends
tripled its sales in the past year and now has about 1,300
accounts. She refused to disclose any figures.
   ``We don't even want them to know we exist,'' added
Reeves-Smith.
   Rudolf Hokanson, who tracks the greeting card industry for Blunt
Ellis &amp; Loewy in Milwaukee, said the company has one advantage:
alternative cards are the fastest growing segment of the industry.
   ``It's impossible to say whether (Among Friends) will survive,''
Hokanson said. ``It's a competitive field, and there are a lot of
quality players. Like with any business, if they have a good
management team and marketing people . . . I think they've got a
chance.''
   The women say they are somewhat surprised at the company's
limited success considering the mistakes they made in the early
going.
   ``We knew nothing about the greeting card industry,'' Kelly
recalled. ``We made some of the worst mistakes you can imagine. But
the cards sold anyway. It was amazing how much people liked them.''
   The women say the company name was a natural because of their
long friendships.
   Kelly, 35, a former physical education teacher, used to own a
popular restaurant and a combination gourmet bakery-gift shop at
the lake. She handles marketing duties and maintains contact with
about 35 sales representatives.
   Parrish, 49, was a hostess at the restaurant and a business
partner in a cookbook Kelly wrote and sold. She keeps a close eye
on the finances.
   The artist, Reeves-Smith, 24, was a student of Kelly's and later
worked in her restaurant and bakery. A longtime friend of the
Parrish family, Reeves-Smith also designed the cover of her
friends' cookbook.
   Kelly and Parrish credit Reeves-Smith, a 1988 art graduate, for
much of Among Friends' success.
   Reeves-Smith works with colored pencils and ink to design
``subjects that conjure up soothing, pleasant feelings, like a hat
box, an old clock, a New England house - that's the style I feel
most comfortable with.''
   The result is detailed, intimate cards featuring a soft,
water-color appearance.
   The message inside is often inspirational, featuring classic
poems or a verse the women came up with themselves. Some contain a
favorite recipe, like Kelly's blueberry-peach-cinnamon muffins.
   The women say that even though they work so closely together
they've managed to stay good friends.
   ``We don't always agree, but we respect each other for our
individual talents and opinions,'' Kelly said. ``We were friends
before we were partners and we want it to stay that way.''

IT'S ALREADY 1992 FOR CARD COMPANIES

As the Christmas season -- the greeting card industry's biggest moneymaker -- 
approaches its climax, major retail card makers are busily planning for 
Valentine's Day, 1991, and Christmas, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally work about 18 months to two years in advance of the holiday 
lines," said Barbara Miller, products spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards in Kansas 
City, Mo. She said planners are researching and planning 1991 Valentine's Day 
cards, which are second to Christmas cards in total sales and volume. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 900 million sweetheart cards and 2.2 billion Christmas cards are 
exchanged in the United States, said Nancy Riviere, director of communications 
for the Greeting Card Assn. in Washington. She added that the card industry 
makes $4 billion in U.S. sales annually. 
</P>
<P>
American Greetings Corp., based in Cleveland, has already begun creative 
development for Christmas, 1992, said John A. Hernandis, director of corporate 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
"The activity doesn't parallel the event," Hernandis said. "Our work for this 
Christmas season ended many, many months ago." 
</P>
<P>
It takes months for the card makers to design, produce, write and finally 
distribute the cards. After assignments are given to artists, writers and 
editors, their proposals are checked by a review committee. Finally, after 
being printed, boxed and packaged, the cards are shipped to warehouses and 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Hallmark, the nation's largest card maker with about 44% of the market, will 
design about 2,000 different Valentine's Day cards for 1991, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Westen, manager of the Card Factory at the Beverly Center in Beverly 
Hills, said his store will not have to put away any unsold Christmas items to 
make room for the next major holiday, because this year's Christmas sales have 
been "wonderful. We have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Westen plans to display Valentine's Day cards beginning in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Easter and Mother's Day are the third- and fourth-largest card-selling 
holidays, with U.S. sales of 185 million and 145 million cards, respectively, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday cards usually remain available for sale for four to six weeks.

   Father's Day card browsers faced a seemingly
endless choice of saccharin-sweet love messages and bad-taste
zingers this year, tailored to senders ranging from first-born
children to adoptees.
   The card glut reflects an effort by makers to capitalize on the
time-strapped consumer's quest for convenience. They're turning out
more types of cards and cramming them into store space approaching
saturation.
   If you looked past the Father's Day racks, the categories go far
beyond run-of-the-mill anniversaries, birthdays, baptisms and bar
mitvahs.
   The holiday lineup has lengthened into a string spanning more
days of the calendar. Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day,
Easter, Father's Day, Halloween and Thanksgiving are the leaders.
But Sweetest Day, Mothers-in-law Day and Boss's Day are getting
space too.
   No occasion is too obscure or private. Safe-sex friendship cards
warn about the dangers of AIDS. Conventional get-well messages now
include versions for the terminally ill.
   One company recently unveiled a faxable greeting card, betting
that use of facsimile machines will get trendier than it already is.
   In their zeal to satisfy every taste and circumstance, card
companies seem determined to make sure no one ever fumbles for words.
   Card sending may be a widely held habit partly because many
people simply don't know how to express their thoughts in writing,
officials of the $3 billion-a-year card industry say.
   Nonetheless, they're not taking any chances on missing a market
of literate card senders. Many supply artwork-adorned versions with
empty space for customers who have the time and inclination to write
their own.
   Most buyers probably jot down a thought or two anyway,
supplementing the generic sentiments, but even so some may feel
guilty as they span the racks for something to send.
   Commentator Andy Rooney has put his feelings about greeting cards
this way: ``Why are we buying someone else's words to convey
supposedly intimate sentiments? Doesn't anyone just sit down with a
blank piece of paper anymore and write a simple note to someone on a
special occasion?''
   More often than not, the answer is no.
   Industry analyst E. Gray Glass III of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. says consumers seem to be clamoring for alternative cards that
are becoming more plentiful.
   These non-occasion cards, appropriate any day, are part of the
industry push to develop new card-sending opportunities.
   ``That's going to have the effect of expanding the per capita
sending of cards,'' says Glass. ``Cards are also impulse purchases
so the idea is that you should have as many types of cards available
on the market as possible.''
   Marianne McDermott, executive vice president of the Greeting Card
Association, says consumers have become more demanding in choosing
cards and makers have reacted nimbly to social change, creating a
card-choice explosion.
   ``People aren't happy to pick up just any card, it has to say
just the right thing,'' McDermott says.
   The challenge is that cards are proliferating but the growth in
retail distributors has slowed to a crawl.
   Space-wise, one of the few remaining card-selling opportunities
is in mass merchandizing outlets and supermarkets.
   ``Food stores are the last to fill up,'' says McDermott.
``There's still some room for expansion there.''
   American Greetings Corp., the Cleveland, Ohio-based company that
ranks second to industry leader Hallmark Cards Inc., always has
maintained a strong mass market presence. Its cards are carried in
giant retailers such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., K mart Corp., big
discounters and drug chains.
   Spokesman John Hernandis says American Greetings is trying to
enhance its good position within the mass volume retailing business.
Responding to retailer needs, it's making shelf space more
productive.
   Redesigned cabinets increase density, accommodating more cards.
High-visibility locator signs make it easier for shoppers to find
what they want.
   Helping shoppers locate desired cards has grown in importance
partly because women, who buy about 90 percent of the 7 billion
greetings cards sold annually in the United States, have less time
to look. Many work full-time.
   American Greetings also is emphasizing a concept called seasonal
program marketing. They did it first this past Easter by grouping
all Easter merchandise _ cards, party items, giftwrapping and plush
toys _ around a central theme. Bloomer Bunny was the pitch rabbit
for the stuff.
   Hernandis says the company intends to use this approach every
holiday. Placing related merchandise readily at hand makes people
more apt to buy.
   ``You end up spending more, buying more than you would
normally,'' says Hernandis. ``You may have your paper cups and paper
plates, but you may not be even thinking about streamers.''
   Gibson Greetings Inc., based in Cincinnati, Ohio, has found ways
to increase card and related merchandise sales in supermarkets,
which now account for about 15 percent of annual sales industrywide
vs. about 7 percent in the early 1980s.
   Greg Ionna, vice president of marketing, says Gibson has
identified several natural tie-ins between foods and cards.
Valentine's Day cards have been placed in candy aisles, puppy and
kitten calendars have crept into pet food shelves and cards are
appearing alongside flowers in grocery-store floral departments.
   ``There's lots of opportunities, we believe, to cross merchandise
with other products,'' Ionna says.
   Hallmark, of Kansas City, Mo., dominates what it calls the social
expression business, with an estimated 42 percent of the market,
followed by American Greetings with about 32 percent and
third-ranked Gibson with about 10 percent. Possibly as many as 1,000
other companies share the rest.
   The rankings are only analysts' best guesses because Hallmark is
a private company and doesn't disclose many financial details.

<HEAD>Baby Boomers Like Humor For Christmas Cards But Tradition Prevails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DWIGHT WOODWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   'Tis the season to be traditional, but silly
Santas, laughing reindeer and teddy bears are arriving in mailboxes
nationwide this year as Christmas card makers appeal to a trend in
card buying that transcends race, religion and sex _ humor.
   Those who like the offbeat can send a card showing cow udders
singing a Christmas carol or Santa kicking a football through the
antlers of a laughing reindeer.
   While the majority of the 2.3 billion Christmas cards sent this
year will reflect more customary symbols of the holiday, humor is
where the growth is, said Terry Carney, spokeswoman for American
Greetings Corp., the largest publicly owned greeting card company
with $1.2 billion in annual sales.
   ``But it's not usually the kind of humor that is nasty, rude or
sarcastic,'' said Ms. Carney.
   About 500 members of the creative staff at American, based in
suburban Cleveland, produce about 2,300 designs a year of which
about one-third are Christmas cards, Ms. Carney said.
   In addition to laughs, specialty cards with a regional flavor _
cactus for the Southwest, for instance _ or messages aimed at
particular occupations are popular.
   As with most consumer tastes, the explanation is demographic.
   ``The bulk of the cards purchased are by people between 35 and
59,'' said E. Gray Glass III, a New York stock market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Inc. Glass. ``These are people that move around a
lot and they want to keep in contact with their friends.''
   Barbara Miller, spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards Inc., agreed that
humor is in this year, but she said tradition dies hard.
   ``Wreaths, holly trees, bells, fireplace and sleigh scenes _
these are the symbols people see as Christmas,'' she said.
   That doesn't mean the giant Hallmark hasn't cultivated a Yuppie
sense of humor. One Hallmark offering shows a dazed cat with a
stocking cap swinging on an ornament attached to Christmas tree
lights. Inside, the caption reads, ``In the air there's a feline of
Christmas.''
   Among the specialty cards designed to suit distinctive tastes
are ones ``for the barber, the teacher, bus driver or the
mailman,'' Ms. Miller said.
   With annual sales of more than $3.5 billion, the privately held
Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., has the biggest single share
of the greeting card market, producing 2,700 card designs for
over-the-counter sales and another 400 different boxed sets of
multiple cards, Ms. Miller said.
   Glass said Hallmark produces about 44 percent of U.S. Christmas
cards, followed by American with 32 percent and Cincinnati-based
Gibson Greetings Inc. about 10 percent.
   Another 700 to 800 U.S. companies produce the remainder of U.S.
Christmas cards with a negligible portion coming from foreign
manufacturers, Glass said.
   Among the strangest, if not funniest, cards to emerge are
pet-to-pet missives.
   ``From our cat to your cat, from our dog to your dog _ people
consider their pets part of the family,'' Ms. Miller said. ``They
are cute cards, not drippy or sentimental.''

<HEAD>Greeting Card Company Reports Earnings Decline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Greetings, the nation's second largest
greeting card company, reported Wednesday that its earnings
declined by 95.1 percent in its fourth quarter, which included
Christmas sales.
   The quarter contributed to a 47.3 percent earnings decline in
American Greetings' fiscal 1988, completed Feb. 29.
   Morry Weiss, president and chief executive officer, said at a
news conference that stiff competition, combined with unexpected
returns of seasonal merchandise, contributed heavily to the
earnings drop.
   The company's AmToy subsidiary also had a disappointing quarter
and year, Weiss said.
   The company earned $748,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter, although revenue amounted to $314.5 million. In the final
quarter of 1987, American Greetings earned $15.3 million, or 48
cents a share, on revenue of $291.2 million.
   For the full fiscal year, American Greetings earned $33.4
million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of nearly $1.2 billion. In
the prior year, earnings came to $63.6 million, or $1.97 a share,
on revenue exceeding $1.2 billion.
   Earnings dropped for a third consecutive year. The per-share
earnings of $1.04 was the lowest since fiscal 1981, when earnings
were 97 cents per share.
   ``While results for fiscal 1988 are a major disappointment, the
good news is that they reflect, in part, a number of corrective
measures taken which should be positive for our future prospects,''
Weiss said.
   He said the company has begun or is considering consolidation of
its manufacturing and distribution operations of the domestic
greeting card business, personnel reductions, revisions in seasonal
merchandise shipping and a scaling back of the toy business.
   He also said the company needs a spurt of creativity to increase
sales, adding that there has been good initial reaction to its new
Nosy Bears and Special Blessings products.
   The Cleveland-based company employs about 20,000. Some layoffs
occurred last year, although the company-wide figure has not been
made public, said John Hernandis, American Greetings spokesman.

   American Greetings Corp. posted a 14% profit rise in the fiscal first quarter, signaling a turnaround for the greeting card maker after a costly two-year battle for market share. 

   Net in the May 31 quarter rose to $15.5 million, or 48 cents a share, from $13.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. 

   In the latest quarter, a reduction in the effective tax rate to 39% from 43% added as much as three cents to per-share figures, the company said. 
However, that increase was partly offset by a "nominal loss" the company had as a result of the previously reported sale of two businesses. 

   Revenue rose about 15% to $303.2 million from $263.3 million. 

   The profit rise, the first improvement in eight consecutive quarters, was slightly better than analysts expected. 
They also viewed American Greetings' robust results as a barometer for the entire industry. 

   "I believe it's a pivotal quarter. 
We expect further good news as we go through the year," Henry Lowenthal, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview. 

   Mr. Lowenthal described the mood at the company's Cleveland headquarters "as definitely upbeat." 
Officials said greeting cards, especially everyday and non-occasion, "showed particularly strong sales increases, both domestically and internationally." 

   In an effort to snare market share, American Greetings, Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark Cards Inc. and Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings Corp. began slashing prices. 
Mr. Lowenthal said the intensity of the battle has abated, although there are occasionally flare-ups in parts of the country. 

   However, the big three's market shares have remained almost unchanged, Mr. Lowenthal said. 
He didn't quibble with analysts' estimates that American Greetings has slightly more than 30% of the market. 

   Hallmark is the leader with about 40%, and Gibson has about 10%. 
About 800 companies, many of them producers of off-beat "alternative cards," make up the industry. 

   E. Gray Glass III, an analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said the quarter's results make him feel more comfortable with his estimate that American Greetings for the full year will earn $1.65 a share. 
In the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, the company earned $33.4 million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of $1.19 billion. 

   Mr. Glass said he had been recommending the stock, but that its price recently has reflected upgraded analysts' estimates. 

   In national over-the-counter composite trading Friday, American Greetings closed at $19.125, up 75 cents.

<HEADLINE>  HALLMARK LEAPS INTO CABLE TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Hallmark, a privately held company based in Kansas City, Mo., with sales of
$2.7 billion last year, began diversifying into cable only in the last two
years.;   "We are in the communications business, and the greeting card is the
most prominent manifestation of that," Irvine Hockaday Jr., Hallmark's
president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview Friday. "We see
in cable an attractive investment on its own with long-term possibilities for
cross-marketing.";   Cencom, a privately held company based in St. Louis, has
about 150,000 subscribers in the St. Louis area. In addition there are 400,000
subscribers in systems that are owned by partnerships affiliated with Cencom
and managed by Cencom.;   Hallmark began moving beyond its core greeting card
business in 1984, when it bought Binney &amp; Smith, the manufacturer of Crayola
crayons, for $204 million.;   Three years later it began expanding into
broadcasting with the purchase of the Spanish International Communication
Corp., a group of nine television stations that carry Spanish-language
programming. The group included WXTV-TV, Channel 41 in New York, and KMEX-TV
in Los Angeles. That purchase price was $286 million.;   In 1988, it bought
Univision Inc., the Spanish-language television programming network, for $265
million.;   Hallmark remains the largest maker of greeting cards, ahead of
American Greetings and Gibson Greetings. Hockaday estimated that Hallmark had
44 percent of the market and that about half of the company's revenues came
from cards.;   He said Hallmark looks at expansion from two angles. On the one
hand, the purchase of Binney &amp; Smith was "a form of reinvestment in our core
business." Many of Hallmark's card sales come from a franchised chain of card
shops, which the company thought would also be good sites for selling Crayola
products.;   "People use the word diversification loosely," Hockaday said. "I
prefer to think of new channels of distribution.";   By contrast, he said, the
more recent acquisitions, of Spanish-language television and cable, were an
example of diversification as most people use the term.;   "We saw a market
that is growing four to five times faster than the Anglo market," he said.  </TEXT>

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Happy occasion for greetings card maker - Second Nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rod Schrager's business maxim is 'focus at the top end of the market'. In
10 years he has turned a chance holiday encounter into a successful
greetings cards company using just that principle.
'A Queen's Award puts the seal on our success in building up a British
presence in an international industry', he says. His company Second Nature,
a publisher of quality cards and Christmas decorations, has a projected
turnover of Pounds 7m this year, and expects to sell more than 1m cards a
month - one quarter of which will be outside the UK.
By contrast, most greetings card manufacturers do not export very much, he
says. The reason is that they focus on the bottom end of the market.
Low-priced cards can easily be produced locally, and some designs -
including those with a particular country's humour - often do not easily
translate to overseas markets.
He points to three segments in the greetings card industry: those bought for
associates; for family and close friends; and 'the one or two beautiful,
more expensive cards for those you are closest to'. Second Nature focuses on
the latter two categories, with a series of elaborate cards at higher
prices.
The company was launched in 1981 after Zimbabwean-born Mr Schrager, who was
then working as an accountant for Peat Marwick in the UK, went on holiday to
the US. He met a Californian designer who asked him to try to sell some of
his greetings cards with floral patterns in Britain. Keeping up the theme,
he also suggested a name: Second Nature.
Schrager was surprised to find British retailers greatly interested, and on
an investment of Pounds 3,000 of his own money, he started to produce the
cards himself, with designs under license from the US.
His big break came four years ago, when he began to sell pop-up cards. The
pop-up was originally invented by the Victorians and then faded out in card
designs, although a number of books using the same principle were beginning
to emerge in the early 1980s.
'I just brought the idea back up to date,' he says. 'We wanted an unusual
design, but one we could produce commercially. It was quite a bold move
then.' Second Nature began selling cards at Pounds 2.50, at a time when the
average card price was about 65p. 'But there was a definite need for a
contemporary card with a higher price.'
Now the company has a total portfolio of some 800 cards. Half a dozen of the
designs have even been patented, and many use sophisticated paper
engineering techniques.
The cards are still entirely made in the UK, using labour-intensive hand
assembly that can take up to three minutes for each card. The company
searched overseas to see if they could be produced more cheaply, but the
difference in costs was negligible.
None of the company's 65 staff are involved directly in production, however.
'I don't believe it's good to vertically integrate,' says Schrager. 'By
contracting out all our assembly work, we can stay on top of innovation and
creativity.'
The focus on higher-end cards also means that the company's business is less
seasonal than for many manufacturers. Nevertheless, Second Nature has
launched high quality Christmas decorations using similar sophisticated
designs.
In two weeks' time, representatives from the company will be anxiously
sitting in New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel. They have 11 nominations for
the 'Louie awards' - named after Louis Prang, inventor of US greetings
cards. But it will be hard to improve on last year, when they were the first
company outside North America to win 'Card of the Year'.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Against Hallmark Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATTY REINERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling
temporarily forbidding Hallmark Cards Inc. from making greeting
card designs resembling those of a small competitor, clearing the
way for a full trial of the company's $50 million damage suit
against Hallmark.
   ``Blue Mountain Arts has pushed the bullies back to the alley.
We've been waiting and waiting on the ruling and it's entirely in
our favor,'' said Bob Gall, general manager of the Boulder,
Colo.-based company, which won the injunction. ``We are absolutely
ecstatic.''
   Blue Mountain brought suit against Hallmark, based in Kansas
City, Mo., in July 1986, alleging that Hallmark's ``Personal
Touch'' line of greeting cards is deceptively similar to Blue
Mountain's ``AireBrush Feelings'' and ``WaterColor Feelings'' lines.
   Blue Mountain alleged that Hallmark was guilty of unfair
competition and copyright infringement.
   A federal court ruled in November 1986 that Blue Mountain's two
card lines have ``an inherently distinctive and highly uniform
overall appearance that is recognizable and attributable to Blue
Mountain.''
   It ordered Hallmark to stop producing and marketing 83 specific
greeting card designs.
   The Blue Mountain cards are characterized by backgrounds of soft
colors done with air brush blends or light watercolor strokes.
   In April, Hallmark appealed the injunction order, arguing that a
single greeting card company should not have ``perpetual rights to
a style of art, a style of text and a concept of their combined
use.''
   In Tuesday's decision, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the injunction, saying the lower court was correct in
determining that the combination of features comprising the trade
dress, or the overall appearance, of Blue Mountain's cards can be
protected.
   A date for a full trial is expected to be scheduled now that the
appeal has been decided. Blue Mountain is seeking $50 million in
damages from Hallmark and will fight what they consider Hallmarks's
other ``copycat'' card designs.
   ``It's not only a victory for Stephen and me and for Blue
Mountain, but it's also a victory for the arts and for all creative
people,'' said Susan Polis Schutz, a poet who co-founded Blue
Mountain with her husband Stephen Schutz.
   Polis Schutz said Blue Mountain's main complaint was the look of
the cards, which she said confused everyone, ``including myself.''
   ``This decision means you can create something and not have to
worry about it being stolen,'' she said. ``One of the things that
Stephen and I learned is that it is possible to stand up for your
rights no matter how small you are or how big your opponent is.''
   Charles W. Hucker, a spokesman for the greeting card giant, said
Tuesday night that Hallmark was disappointed but not surprised by
the decision.
   ``We will consider making a further appeal. It is important to
understand that this is a preliminary decision based on a limited
airing of the issues,'' Hucker said. ``We will have the opportunity
to present our case in full for the first time at the trial.''
   Hucker noted that the Blue Mountain suit contended Hallmark
copied the smaller company's look.
   ``It is absolutely not true, and they know it's not true, that
we copied specific designs,'' he said.

   American Greetings Corp. reported a 31% decline in fiscal third-quarter net income and said it expects a drop for the year as well. 

   For the third quarter ended Nov. 30, the company earned $18.2 million, or 57 cents a share, down from the year-earlier $26.3 million, or 82 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 2% to $370.9 million from $364.3 million. 

   The maker of greeting cards, gifts, wrappings and stationery said it expects to post net income of between $1 and $1.10 a share for fiscal 1988. 
For fiscal 1987, earnings were $1.97 a share. 

   But Morry Weiss, president and chief executive officer said in a statement that the termination of an employee benefits plan could add as much as 10 cents a share to the year-end figure. 
He also said if certain accounting changes are made, as expected, profits could climb to the $1.40 to $1.50 range. 

   Mr. Weiss said the falloff in third-quarter profits was due to a variety of factors, including returns of seasonal merchandise that exceeded expectations; a dismal year for the toy industry and, thus, the company's AmToy unit; smaller than expected sales increases, particularly on non-greeting card items; and requirements for higher levels of working capital that resulted in increased borrowing and higher interest expense. 

   Mr. Weiss also cited keen competition and said pressure on earnings should continue through the fourth quarter.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Brownsword in cards merger with Hallmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRATULATIONS to Andrew Brownsword, thought to be one of the highest paid
men in the UK, who is moving house.
Mr Brownsword, who started designing and publishing greetings cards from his
kitchen table more than 20 years ago, has agreed to merge his group of
companies with the UK - Ireland operations of Hallmark Cards, the world's
largest greetings card publisher with annual sales of more than Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2bn).
In its last published accounts for the 13 months to January 1991 the
Brownsword company, which owns the quintessentially English Gordon Fraser
and Forever Friends, reported turnover of nearly Pounds 45m and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 19.7m.
Hallmark Cards is one of the biggest privately owned companies in the US. It
is based in Kansas City, Missouri, where founder Joyce Hall started selling
postcards in 1910.
Mr Hall, who was named after a bishop and constantly received mail addressed
to Miss Hall, died aged 91 in 1982, handing the business on to his son,
Donald J Hall.
The company employs 700 artists and offers cards for every occasion - from
birth to death, taking in all stages of modern American courtship, including
a request for information on a partner's HIV status.
In the UK, Hallmark has 140 retail outlets known as Hall of Cards, where it
offers its collection of brands including the Snoopy range. Mr Brownsword,
46, will assume overall responsibility for the combined group's operations
in the UK and Ireland.
Neither Mr Brownsword or Mr Don Read, Hallmark UK/Ireland's group managing
director, were available for comment yesterday.
But Mr Read said in a press statement that the merger 'brings together two
of the leading names in the greetings cards business and offers exciting
growth prospects for the industry as a whole.'

   CLEVELAND -- American Greetings Corp. said Edward
Fruchtenbaum, who has been credited with leading the
company's turnaround in core greeting card operations, has
been named president and chief operating officer.
   Mr. Fruchtenbaum, 43 years old, succeeds Morry Weiss, who
was named chairman. Mr. Weiss, 51, will remain chief
executive officer, a post he has held since 1987. He had been
president and chief operating officer since 1978. Irving I.
Stone assumes the new title of founder-chairman and retains
his post as chairman of the board's executive committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since January 1990, Mr. Fruchtenbaum had been director and
president of American Greeting's U.S. Greeting Card Division,
which accounts for roughly 90% of the company. Under his
leadership, the company rebounded from an earning's low of
$1.04 a share in 1988 to a high of $2.61 in fiscal 1991. The
company's fiscal year 1992 ends Saturday; analysts expect
earnings to hit $2.80 a share for fiscal 1992.
   All domestic and international operating units will now
report to Mr. Fruchtenbaum.

SINGLE LIFE: GREETING CARDS PUT NEW STAMP ON DATING RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Life.

<P>
Situation One: You were under the impression that your blind date had as much 
fun as you did. But 2 weeks have passed and you haven't heard a peep out of 
him. What's a woman to do? 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Send him a card, perhaps the one that says, "1,387 hours, 22 seconds. 
Average length of time a woman waits for a man to call. . . . Time's up." 
(Carolyn Bean Cards.) 
</P>
<P>
Situation Two: You and your best friend recently had a no-good-men 
conversation, which she immediately followed up with an appropriate card. So 
now you owe her one. How can you outdo her? 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Go to a Hallmark shop, and find the card that says, "We shouldn't 
worry about finding a man. There are lots of men out there. They're married, 
lunatics and losers, sure, but they're out there." 
</P>
<P>
And so on, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of such greeting cards 
aimed at the singles market. Commonly found in the "Fun and Love" section at 
gift shops, the humorous cards address every aspect of single life -- for 
better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
There are post-date cards, love-hate cards, losing-weight cards. There are 
congratulations-on-your-divorce cards and sorry-your-dumb-boyfriend-dumped-you 
cards. There are cards too sweet for words and cards too dirty for mention. 
</P>
<P>
"We have cards for all the different stages of dating -- first date, casual 
flirtation, longstanding relationships," Hallmark spokeswoman Barbara Miller 
said. "They are one of our fastest-growing areas." 
</P>
<P>
Paper Moon Graphics, the Los Angeles-based manufacturer that rocketed into 
orbit 12 years ago, sells as many "Fun and Love" cards as it does birthday 
cards. "In the past 3 years, our relationship cards have had phenomenal 
success," said Vivian Lipman, national sales manager for Paper Moon. 
</P>
<P>
Lipman attributed the genre's upward mobility to relationship-confused yuppies. 
"So many men have the Peter Pan syndrome (i.e., fear of commitment) that it has 
become women's little joke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Male-bashing is definitely hot in card land. "Quick: What's the difference?" 
asks a Hallmark witticism displaying a rock vs. a man on its cover. Answer: 
"Right, the rock is slightly more sensitive (also a better listener)." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Templeman, president of Southern California-based Scott Cards 
(distributed by Recycled Paper Products), gave two reasons for the popularity 
of male-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
First, women buy 85% to 90% of all greeting cards. "It's a female-dominated 
market," Templeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Templeman added, "all those male-bashing books of the past 10 
years" have fanned the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a double standard," he said. "Some of the things you can get away with 
saying about men would be viewed as sexist if said about women. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's all in fun; I don't think men take this stuff too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Relationship themes have been "revolutionary rather than evolutionary," said 
Dennis Chupa, executive director of everyday products for American Greeting. 
"They emerge almost spontaneously -- seemingly overnight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce cards did not fare well for American Greeting until they recently 
gained a sense of humor: "Let's face it: Your prince turned out to be a frog." 
</P>
<P>
"Still, divorce cards are tricky, no matter how they're approached," Chupa 
said. "You have to know how the person is handling their divorce before you can 
send them a joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Carolyn Bean Cards offers this consolation: "Your spouse 
was a louse. Be sure you get the house." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of "Fun and Love" cards actually deal with love -- or, at least, like. 
Many do so in a risque manner: 
</P>
<P>
* "The moment our eyes met, the rest of me wanted to get acquainted." 
(Carlton.) 
</P>
<P>
* "I've had it with you. And boy was it great." (Paper Moon.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Wanna cuddle? Or whatever." (Scott Cards.) 
</P>
<P>
* "You make me feel like a kid again. Wanna sleep over?" (Hallmark.) 
</P>
<P>
That last one is about as suggestive as Hallmark gets, but other manufacturers 
push the limits. "Some of the most conservative-looking people come in here and 
buy cards with four-letter words," said Sandra Small, manager of Mr. G's 
Expressions card shop in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hallmark's 3-year-old Shoebox Cards division sprinkles 
double-entendres throughout its line of cards, the company still steers clear 
of strong language. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard call," spokeswoman Miller admitted. "Our overriding concern is 
that customers consider our cards in good taste. Yet we don't want to seem 
old-fashioned; we want to be timely and to reflect contemporary society." 
</P>
<P>
Many "Fun and Love" cards reflect the issues singles are facing in contemporary 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Relationship befuddlement: "If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right. 
But if loving you is right, I don't want to be wrong, either. I'm so confused." 
(Hallmark.) 
</P>
<P>
Safe sex: "So it's our first date. How does dinner, a movie and a blood test 
sound?" (Paper Moon.) 
</P>
<P>
Birth control: One dog to another -- "Jowles, I hate to spoil the romantic 
mood, but have you been fixed?" (Paper Moon.) 
</P>
<P>
Fear of scaring off a love interest: "Please don't take this as a sign of 
weakness, but I miss you." (Scott Cards.) 
</P>
<P>
Noncommittal communication: "I want to tell you how I really feel. I really 
feel fine, thanks." (Recycled Paper.) 
</P>
<P>
Unrequited love: "I'm so miserable without you.. . . . It's almost like having 
you here." And, "Thinking of you. . . . Wish you would change." (Paper Moon.) 
</P>
<P>
But most "Fun and Love" cards are on the lighter side. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Zack, manager of Krazy Kards store in Santa Ana, summed them up this way: 
"They get the message across without saying, 'I want to have your children.' "

   It's a child's delight _ rows of bright
red, yellow and green crayons that pop out of molding machines,
roll along conveyor belts and slip into little boxes that have
become a fixture in any toy store.
   But Binney &amp; Smith is making more than Crayola crayons at its
plant in this small Kansas town south of Wichita. The 85-year-old
company has branched into art products designed to appeal to
everyone from toddlers to professionals, as part of a larger
diversification plan by parent company Hallmark Cards Inc.
   The Kansas City-based cardmaker bought Binney &amp; Smith for $200
million five years ago, shortly after Irvine O. Hockaday Jr. became
Hallmark's president and chief executive officer. Hockaday has
since steered Hallmark into markets ranging from real estate to
Spanish-language television, but he still thinks his first buy was
a good one.
   ``It's hard to match the criteria we set,'' Hockaday said. ``But
Binney &amp; Smith is incomparable as far as people recognizing the
Crayola name and having good feelings about it. We thought that
feeling could be widened to different age groups, and we were
right.''
   Binney &amp; Smith plants in Winfield and at the subsidiary's
headquarters in Easton, Pa., now turn out about 9 million crayons a
day in 72 colors.
   But with marketing help from Hallmark, they also make new and
higher-priced lines of washable felt-tip markers and paints for
youngsters, and more precise erasable colored mechanical pencils
for older children. They also produce the company's Liquitex brand
of acrylic paints used by art students and professional artists.
   Last year, Binney &amp; Smith even began selling coloring books.
   ``Our crayon market has always been as stable as any market can
be,'' said Jim Wilson, manager of the Winfield plant. But parents
were looking for other products for their children.
   ``We knew mothers would love this,'' Wilson said of the felt-tip
markers printed with ``erasable'' in large letters. ``They were
telling us they wanted it to keep markers off the furniture and
walls.''
   In addition, the company is selling its products in new places,
from hotels to airlines, and planning more products targeted toward
teen-agers and the growing adult crafts market.
   ``The teen-age and young-adult market is enormous,'' Hockaday
said. ``We feel we can migrate the feelings that a young person has
toward Crayola into other products as they move into the pre-teen
years and then beyond.''
   So far, the theory seems to be working. Hallmark doesn't reveal
financial figures because it is privately owned, but Hockaday said
Binney &amp; Smith and its 1,300 employees have done slightly better
than Hallmark forecast five years ago. Its revenues and profits
have been growing by double digits in the last few years, he said.
   Hallmark itself, which had sales of $2.3 billion in 1988, still
specializes in greeting-cards and the related products in dealers'
stores.
   Its lines of greeting cards, including the Hallmark line and the
mass-market Ambassador line sold in grocery and drug stores,
account for 44 percent of all U.S. card sales.
   But officials decided they needed to diversify for the future of
the company owned by descendants of founder Joyce Hall and some
employees.
   ``We don't see any serious clouds on the horizon of our core
business, but theoretically, technology could eat into the
greeting-card business a bit in the future,'' Hockaday said. ``And
theoretically, rapidly increasing postal rates if they occurred
could slow our sales.''
   In 1987 and 1988, Hallmark bought 10 Spanish-language television
stations and a Spanish-language TV network based in Los Angeles.
   The company had some experience making greeting cards for
Hispanic customers but felt the market had been mostly overlooked
by advertisers in the past, Hockaday said.
   ``The Hispanic market is growing faster than any other market
segment that I'm aware of,'' Hockaday said. ``We think it's one of
those unique, niche, growth opportunities.''
   Future acquisitions are under consideration, Hockaday said, but
Hallmark officials view the market as ``overheated'' right now and
are acting cautiously.
   Meanwhile at the Winfield plant, crayons now share floor space
with washable markers. But it's still crayons that most fascinate
the local schoolchildren who regularly tour the plant, said plant
manager Wilson.
   ``Their appeal is enduring,'' he said. ``That's our greatest
strength.''

<TEXT>     A little isn't enough, of course, when you are talking about big business,
so the 49-year-old Kline and his partner, independent business consultant Dick
Salvatierra, 47, are attempting to mine the rich vein of passion people have
about commercial flight with their fledgling greeting card company, Zap'em
Corp., based in Bethesda, Md.;   Kline and Salvatierra were rooting around for
an entrepreneurial idea last year when they decided that there was a need out
there in terminal hell for an organized way to gripe. Ergo: cards that give
airlines the what-for concerning late flights, lost bags, bad food and old
magazines.;   One card shows a passenger being carried by a turkey with the
caption: "There are terrific ways to travel. Yours was not one of them!"
Another turkey-themed one pictures the birds slumped in front of an
arrival-departure sign reading "delayed," "overbooked" and "canceled," and
says, "You do things differently! How about doing them right!?";   Included
with all cards are addresses for all the major airlines and the names of their
executives, so disgruntled travelers can get through to the top.;   "People
are more likely to say something when they do not receive what they paid for
than when they receive outstanding service," said Kline, a former trucking
company executive who took a "three-year vacation" when he sold his trucking
stake in 1988. "So we thought it would make a good business.";   It could be.
The $4.4 billion greeting card industry is expected to grow to $5.6 billion by
1995, according to New York-based Packaged Facts. It is dominated by big firms
such as Hallmark, American Greetings and Gibson Greetings with a combined
share of more than 85 percent of the market.;   Smaller card companies have
made strides in the past decade with a 14 percent share, and sales of
alternative cards are expected to grow from 10 percent to 20 percent
annually.;   Zap'em's founders test marketed their product at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport by buttonholing travelers. They
toned down meaner cards after they found out unhappy customers did not want to
slam an airline, but rather wanted the ability to point out problems. The test
spurred the pair to create one positive card, so good service could be
commended.;   The pair is polling airport executives to determine if they are
threatened by having the cards available in airport gift shops.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. did some reshuffling
among its top-level management to reflect Chairman Donald J. Hall's
diminished role in recent years, the company's president said.
   The Kansas City greeting card company dissolved the three-member
office of the chairman and replaced it with a four-person corporate
executive committee.
   It also hired former BATUS Inc. President Henry F. Frigon to be
chief financial officer and fill the newly created post of
executive vice president-corporate development and strategy.
   Hallmark also renamed its main greeting card and related
businesses from the Social Expression Group to the Personal
Communication Group. That group will form a committee to look at
ways to expand the business internationally and through other
means.
   The reshuffling reflects the lessened role that Hall has been
playing, said Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and chief executive
officer.
   Hall, 62, remains the chairman and is still an important
presence at the company his father founded, Hockaday said. Hall
said in a statement to employees that he supports the changes
``enthusiastically.''
   Hall, Hockaday and Vice Chairman David H. Hughes have served
until now as the office of the chairman, the top executive
committee at the $2.5 billion company, which is the nation's
largest greeting card firm. Hughes retires at the end of the year.
   Hockaday and Frigon will share the new corporate executive
committee with Robert A. Kipp, group vice president of corporate
communications and services, and Robert L. Stark, executive vice
president of Hallmark Cards Inc. and president of the Personal
Communication Group.
   Frigon will occupy a new layer of management and will overseethe finance,
tax, and corporate development and planning divisions.

<HEAD>Consent Decree Ends Legal Battle Between Colorado Card Company and
Hallmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards today agreed to replace a line of
greeting cards that had been challenged in a lawsuit by Blue
Mountain Arts, a tiny Colorado card company that had accused
Hallmark of copying its card design.
   The consent decree filed in Denver U.S. District Court ends the
legal dispute between the two companies that began when Blue
Mountain Arts of Boulder filed a $50 million lawsuit in July 1986
against Hallmark.
   The card war had been scheduled to go to trial Jan. 2 in federal
court here. At issue were a line of cards, featuring watercolor art
and free-verse messages, which Blue Mountain created and Hallmark
allegedly copied.
   Under terms of the consent decree, Hallmark will stop publishing
its Personal Touch line of cards, discontinue use of the Personal
Touch name and take steps to repurchase the cards from Hallmark
stores.
   Blue Mountain had alleged that Hallmark's Personal Touch line of
greeting cards was deceptively similar to Blue Mountain's
``Airebrush Feelings'' and ``WaterColor Feelings.''
   The decree also stipulates a monetary settlement, but neither
Hallmark nor Blue Mountain would disclose the amount.
   Last week, Hallmark lost a bid in the U.S. Supreme Court to
overturn an injunction prohibiting Hallmark from distributing the
83 cards in its Personal Touch line.
   ``We are absolutely thrilled with this decree,'' said Susan
Polis Schutz, poet and co-founder of Blue Mountain. ``This is
important not only for us, but for all artists and businesses.''
   Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain, said that while the
decree requires Hallmark to pay a damage settlement, that is not
the decree's most important aspect.
   ``We feel the emphasis in the case is not money, but that
artists and businesses around the country can feel free to create
without fear of being copied,'' he said.
   Hallmark said one of the key points in the agreement with Blue
Mountain was that it will introduce a new card line with a new name
to replace Personal Touch. The company said it agreed not to
develop products similar in appearance to Blue Mountain's.
   The Kansas City card manufacturer also said it agreed in the
settlement not to pressure Hallmark outlets to refuse Blue Mountain
products for sale. And it said the agreement provides that neither
side admit liability or wrongdoing.
   ``We have found common ground with Blue Mountain because we are
interested in promoting fair competition while protecting both
companies' trademarks,'' Irv Hockaday, president and chief
executive officer of Hallmark, said.
   Blue Mountain attorney Hary Melkonian of Los Angeles said the
consent decree was ``a convenient way to resolve the lawsuit
without the ordeal of a trial, since little else could have been
gained.''

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Clinton buys in time to boost Christmas
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinton Cards added 86 shops to its chain of 277 greeting card and gift
stores in a Pounds 3.5m purchase announced yesterday alongside its interim
results.
The group, which is controlled by the Lewin family, claims that the
acquisition from its principal card supplier, Hallmark, the UK arm of the US
group, lifts its share of the UK greetings card market from 7.5 per cent to
9 per cent.
The acquisition will lead to the closure of more than 12 stores where
Hallmark shops compete with Clinton Cards in England and Wales. 'It
basically takes a competitor out of the high street,' said Mr Clinton Lewin,
managing director.
Pre-tax losses deepened from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 2.19m while turnover
edged up from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 32.7m in the six months to July 30. An
interim deficit is normal because the chain makes a large proportion of its
profits in the Christmas period.
The group blamed weak consumer confidence for a 4 per cent drop in
like-for-like sales and a 'disappointing' operating loss of Pounds 1.98m
(Pounds 770,000). In June the shares fell 31p to 105p after the company
warned that profits were unlikely to exceed last year's Pounds 3m.
Hallmark's 86 shops incurred a loss of Pounds 345,000 last year on turnover
of Pounds 21.1m. The purchase, which includes Pounds 2.7m of stock, will be
completed before Christmas trading begins.
A cash consideration will be paid over four and a quarter years without
interest, with annual repayments linked to Clinton's purchase of Hallmark
goods. Gearing stood at about 60 per cent at the period end.
Losses per share emerged at 8.4p (3.66p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.6p.
COMMENT
Clinton Cards' acquisition of the Hallmark shops seems to make sense for the
card retailer. The stores should need little work to fixtures and fittings,
and will be trading for Clinton over the busy Christmas period. Moreover,
Clinton's repayments are attractively linked to its demand for Hallmark
goods over the next four years. The interim results are worse than last
year, but are not as gloomy as expected after this summer's profits warning.
The group is thought to have improved cost control and should be in a good
position to benefit when consumer confidence returns. Analysts forecast
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m for the year, which gives a prospective
multiple of 13.7 on yesterday's close of 103p, up 2p. For those confident of
an upturn in consumer spending, the shares have scope for further recovery.

GREETING CARD LINE PULLED FROM RACKS AFTER PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa card shop took several greeting cards off its shelves Tuesday after 
more than 25 San Diego State University students picketed the store to protest 
the cards, which they described as racially and sexually offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dick and Suzie Collier, who own Suzie's Hallmark on Lake Murray Boulevard, said 
they did not believe the cards, which show a large black woman in a variety of 
outfits and roles that students described as "demeaning to women and blacks," 
were offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have bought them if we thought they were," Dick Collier said. 
"They seemed funny." Collier said the cards were probably not in good taste, 
but he did not believe they were racist. 
</P>
<P>
One shows a large black woman and a slim white woman posing as prostitutes. "I 
would have gotten you a surprise for your birthday," the card reads, "but, I 
was afraid I'd get the size and color wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Billi Gordon, the black model, and the Colliers called the protest "censorship 
by intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
"No one is sacred when it comes to comedy," Gordon said in a telephone 
interview Tuesday. "That's the beauty of America. . . . You have the right to 
express yourself. I find Eddie Murphy's attitudes toward women and homosexuals 
very offensive, but I would never go so far as to say he shouldn't be allowed 
to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Collier said the cards were removed, not to satisfy the students' demands 
but because their protest was distracting to customers and to neighboring 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who demonstrated Monday and Tuesday, plan to protest at other San 
Diego stores that carry the cards, including Graffiti in Horton Plaza, unless 
it also agrees to pull the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided Monday and Tuesday would be the best days to protest (at Suzie's 
Hallmark) because it was the day before Valentine's Day and it would hit the 
store the hardest. We wanted to tell them we wouldn't put up with this," said 
SDSU student Kim Harris, one of several students who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Meyd, floor manager at Graffiti, said the store had not received any 
complaints about the cards. Meyd could not comment on whether or not the cards 
would be removed, and a store manager could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is to get them off the shelf and to raise awareness of the existence 
of greeting cards which are demeaning to women and blacks," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Students got involved Friday after Theodore Kornweibel, an Afro-American 
studies professor at SDSU, brought to class a few cards purchased from Suzie's 
Hallmark, Harris said. One showed model Billi Gordon imitating Prissy, the 
squeaky-voiced, tearful young slave in the movie "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
The students then organized their protest and are now compiling a list of other 
retailers who sell the cards. Signatures are being gathered to petition the 
publisher, West Graphics Inc. of San Francisco, to discontinue Gordon's line. 
Harris said SDSU students were also contacting friends at other California 
State University and University of California campuses to see if the offensive 
cards were being sold elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Randy West, president of West Graphics, said the company had no plans to 
discontinue Gordon's cards, which he said have sold very well. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of stores which sell only black merchandise and are geared 
for blacks. They stock our cards and do not have a problem with them," he said. 
"We're not attacking anybody and we're not trying to create a victim." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon voiced personal objection to the student's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"They're protesting my . . . spoof on the 'Gone With the Wind' character. I 
find that offensive because my grandmother was a scrub woman like that," she 
said. "I don't feel ashamed at having come from slaves. . . . I think it's a 
proud part of my heritage because it's something we overcame." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU sophomore La Shon Walker said Gordon was "making a mockery of her own 
heritage and that's . . . sad." 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Bernay Griffin, another SDSU sophomore, said the Prissy character was 
an example of the fact that greeting cards often fail to depict blacks in a 
positive light. 
</P>
<P>
Kornweibel said of Gordon: "If she can feel that unaffected by the stereotype, 
that's OK for her. But there are millions of black women who labor under that 
cruel stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Comford, of El Capitan High School in Lakeside, said black history should 
not be presented in a "supposedly humorous" way. Comford, 17, attended the 
protest after hearing about it from a friend at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
The students were well-dressed and followed picketing guidelines because "we 
didn't want to be known as rowdy college students out for no reason," Harris 
said. "We wanted to let people know we were serious." 
</P>
<P>
Three or four bystanders joined the picket line Monday, Harris said. A 
middle-aged man and his two children who joined the protest Tuesday declined to 
comment or give his name.

<LEADPARA>  Tired of those silly, sappy, pre-printed greeting cards they sell at your
local drugstore?;   Now there's a computer gimmick for people who think they
can do better. Hallmark Cards Inc., the company that built its fortune by
saying it for you, is giving you a chance to say it yourself.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DERE FREND, I WRIT THIS ALL MY SELF
NEW HALLMARK SERVICE LETS THE SENDER COMPOSE,
PRINT OWN CARDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Over the summer, the nation's largest greeting card manufacturer installed
computer terminals in 400 of its retail outlets in 11 Western states. The
terminals allow customers to personalize their own cards and write their own
clever greetings.;   Each computer terminal walks the customer through a
step-by-step process that can take just a few minutes. The result comes out of
a high-performance laser printer that matches script and type styles to blend
personalized information -- names, addresses, short messages -- with a variety
of pre-printed formats.;   It costs more: $3.50 per card. But the higher price
enables customers to let their imaginations run wild -- within reason.;   "We
had one person come in the other day and make a birthday card for her dog.
They were going to have a party," said saleswoman Marci  Pollack at Sherri's
Hallmark store in Foster City.;   Profanities automatically are rejected by
the computer, but that doesn't mean the message can't be risque.;   One
birthday format lets the buyer insert a friend's name into this advisory:
"Doctors say that some previously normal people suddenly lose all interest in
sex when they turn (whatever age the friend is turning)! But don't worry about
it happening to you. You weren't previously normal.";   The syrupy option also
is available. A "birthday prayer" card reads: "Dear Lord, thank you for making
(the name of a friend) the most caring, thoughtful friend the world could ever
know.";   If sales go well, a Hallmark spokeswoman said, the company will
introduce the machine in other parts of the country next year.;   Hallmark and
other companies have used computers to create personalized announcements
before, but spokeswoman Meg Townsend said the previous systems have not
offered the same quality results -- and they usually required a store employee
to operate the computer. Hallmark is the first national manufacturer to use a
system that the customer operates, she said.;   "We've gotten a lot of return
customers," said Peter Hartung, sales clerk at McWhorter's Stationers on
Meridian Avenue in San Jose, where a terminal was installed two weeks ago.;  
Still, the new technology is not for everyone.;   "I showed it to one person
who couldn't think of anything to say," said another McWhorter's employee,
Rachel Gomez. "They ended up buying one of the old (pre-printed) cards."  </TEXT>

   Selling the Census 

   To Minority Groups 

   AD AGENCIES specializing in minorities are on the rise, and now the Census Bureau is seeking their help. 

   To get a better measure of minorities -- traditionally the "hard-to-count" segment of the population -- the bureau for the first time has hired three minority agencies to carry out campaigns targeting blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans for the 1990 census. 

   Mingo Group of New York is handling the black account; Castor GS&amp;B Advertising, also of New York, is focusing on Hispanics; and Muse Cordero Chen, a Los Angeles agency, will tailor ads for Asian Americans. 
WPP Group's Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit remains the lead agency for general census advertising. 

   Each of the agencies is working on ad campaigns that will run from January to May. 
The census begins in March. 

   "We're hoping to do better counting these people than we've done in the past," says Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the Census Bureau. 
He says the undercount rate for the total population in 1980 was 1.4%. 
By contrast, the undercount rate for blacks was 5% or 6%. 
The rate was similarly high for other minority groups. 

   Mr. Bounpane says he hopes the minority communications experts will be able to drive home the point that census results are entirely confidential. 
Officials speculate that minorities avoid being counted out of unfounded fears that government authorities have access to the data. 
Illegal aliens, for instance, worry their names will be passed to immigration officials. 

   The Census Bureau isn't the only group struggling with this issue. 
The American Marketing Association in Chicago sponsored a case-study competition among college students on the problems of persuading minorities to take part in the census. 

   Winning teams from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville suggested for one that community leaders should be enlisted to promote the fact that census reporting is crucial for proper political representation. 

   Sales Cheer the Makers 

   Of 'Occasionless' Cards 

   GREETING CARDS aren't just for birthdays or holidays anymore. 
Alternative cards, those not tied to any specific occasion, are booming -- even to the surprise of manufacturers. 

   According to Packaged Facts Inc., the alternative-card segment of the greeting card market grew 25% last year. 
It also accounted for most of the industry's overall 5% growth, the New York-based research firm says. 

   Alternative cards include blank cards and cards with everyday jokes, such as those featuring the Ziggy comic strip character or drawings by Gary Larson, the Far Side cartoonist. 

   "We had no idea the market would turn out to be this big," says John Sullivan, general manager of Hallmark Cards Inc.'s alternative card division. 
He says Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., is readying a "major" new line of alternative cards that will be introduced later this year. 

   Industry executives point to a younger, more impulsive card buyer as a reason for the jump. 
Another factor is increased distribution of alternative cards at grocery stores, drug stores and mass merchandisers. 

   "The size of the greeting card department in food stores has tripled in the last 10 years," says Ed Fruchtenbaum, vice president at American Greetings Corp. in Cleveland. 

   For the industry, it's a great bonus that the alternative segment isn't cyclical or seasonal. 
Alternative cards are less dependent on holiday sales and offer more opportunity for growth. 
Says Mr. Fruchtenbaum: "There's a fixed number of birthdays in the world." 

   One Man's Luxury Is 

   Another Man's Waste 

   MORE THAN 75% of Americans think that it's a waste of money to buy a luxury car costing $40,000 or more, to gamble at a casino and to own a car phone, according to a study by Bruskin Associates, a New Brunswick, N.J., market research firm. 

   The study -- based on interviews with 1,000 men and women -- suggests not too surprisingly that household income is a key factor in the way many people rate the value of purchases and activities. 
For example, 38% of those with annual family income under $40,000 said that taking vacations in foreign countries is a waste of money; only 19% of those with family incomes greater than $40,000 felt that way. 

   Perhaps more surprising were some large differences of opinion even when the so-called luxury item costs just a bit more than simpler versions of the same product or service. 
A full 71% of families making $40,000 or less said imported beer is a waste of money; 59% of those making over $40,000 felt that way. 
Many respondents, but especially those with higher incomes, believe seeing Broadway shows, investing in the stock market or dining at expensive restaurants are worthwhile expenses. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE SEVEN most common prefixes and suffixes in U.S. company names are Ameri, Nat, Mark, Star, Uni, Lead and Inter, according to Delano Goldman &amp; Young Inc., a New York naming specialist that conducted a broad search of business names and trademarks. . . . 
Word of mouth will have to sell Gentleman Jack, a new super-premium whiskey. 
The product, Brown-Forman Corp.'s first new whiskey since Jack Daniels was introduced 100 years ago, won't be supported by advertising. 
Officials hope the news will spread among patrons of fancy restaurants and selected liquor stores.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Hallmark Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday without comment refused to hear
Hallmark Cards Inc.'s appeal of an injunction that bars it from
making and distributing greeting cards at issue in a lawsuit filed
by a small Colorado firm.
   The ruling is the latest development in the legal dispute
between Hallmark, the Kansas City, Mo.-based greeting card giant,
and tiny Blue Mountain Arts of Boulder.
   At the center of the dispute is Blue Mountain's contention that
Hallmark copied a line of cards featuring watercolor decorations
and long free-verse poetry.
   Hallmark contends the market should be open to competing
versions of the cards. Blue Mountain, on the other hand, is bent on
protecting what it believes is a unique creation.
   ``This legal battle is emotionally draining and is tiring us
out, but we are strongly committed to this fight for artists'
rights,'' Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain Arts, said.
   Blue Mountain Arts had filed a lawsuit against Hallmark accusing
the company of copying the cards. The case is scheduled to go to
trial Jan. 2 in Denver U.S. District Court.
   ``Given the procedural precedents, this action was not
unexpected,'' said Steve Doyal, Hallmark's corporate media
relations manager, in reaction to the Supreme Court's move.
   Hallmark has denied the ``copycat'' allegations, and it
challenged a November 1986 injunction imposed by Denver federal
Judge Jim Carrigan that prohibits Hallmark from producing and
distributing the cards. Hallmark has since stopped printing the 83
cards in question, said Doyal.
   Hallmark attorneys had said the injunction gives Blue Mountain a
monopoly on such cards that is ``unlimited in time and scope.'' But
with the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the appeal, the injunction
will stand.
   ``The legal issues now to be tried concerns whether any card
company should have the right to create a monopoly simultaneously
with an artist's completed work product,'' said Doyal. ``While such
a legal policy would ultimately benefit Hallmark, given our size
and creative staff, it would actually stifle the viability of small
companies such as Blue Mountain.''

   America's greeting card to the Soviet Union,
which an Iowa businessman hopes will bear 2 million signatures by
week's end, gathered only a few dozen names during a brief stop here
Tuesday.
   The scroll-like card, which has about 30,000 names on it, looked
somewhat dog-eared when it was unrolled on Fountain Square Plaza.
The scroll was taken down after less than an hour because of high
wind. Among the signers were some policemen and Cincinnati Vice
Mayor Peter Strauss.
   ``Greetings from the people of Cincinnati to my friends in
Russia,'' Strauss wrote.
   ``We got some tears but we made repairs. It's fine,'' said Louis
Bolster, who designed the 42-by-12-foot greeting card Iowa
businessman James Lawlor intends to send on Saturday to the Soviet
Union.
   The card later was taken to City Hall in Columbus, where it
remained for two hours. The mayor of Columbus was not in his office
Tuesday.
   The tour originated in Chicago on Monday and was supposed to stop
in Indianapolis, but heavy snow wiped that leg of the trip off the
planned eight-city tour.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer was the first to sign the card in
that city. He wrote, ``Merry Christmas and God Bless,'' and declared
the card ``a tremendous idea.''
   The group's car hit a wall on a snowy ramp in Chicago, but no one
was injured and the group continued westward, said Janet Emard,
assistant director of the project.
   Lawlor, who owns a safety goggle manufacturing company in
Fairfield, Iowa, said he woke up Dec. 1 with an idea of sending ``a
message of peace ... from one superpower to another.''
   He had the card made. It says, in Russian: ``Dear Mr. (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev, We citizens of the United States of
America wish to extend to you and the people of the Soviet Union our
great appreciation for your courage and dedication in bringing peace
to the world. Merry Christmas.''
   Under the Russian Orthodox church calendar, Christmas is
celebrated on Jan. 7, but the main winter holiday in the Soviet
Union is New Year's Day.
   Lawlor has affixed to the card some 30,000 signatures that
arrived by mail from around the country, including those of
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and
singer Barbra Streisand.
   The group, Lawlor said, plans to finish the tour at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington.
   Pan American Airlines has donated a plane to fly the greeting
card to Moscow. Holiday Inn is providing lodging for the truck
driver and others in Lawlor's party.
   The project, according to Lawlor, will cost about $50,000.
   Other cities on the tour include Columbus, Pittsburgh, New York,
Philadelphia and Washington.

<HEAD>Groups Object to Mixed-Religion Holiday Cards</HEAD>

   Greeting cards that blend Hannukah and Christmas
religious symbols are objectionable, say two groups representing
Christians and Jews.
   The American Jewish Committee and the National Conference of
Christians and Jews criticized such mixed cards as ``an affront to
Judaism, to Christianity, and to serious interfaith relations.''
   ``To combine the religious and cultural symbols of Hannukah and
Christmas in greeting card art is to diminish the sacred symbols of
each faith,'' the organizations said Wednesday in a statement
released by the AJC.
   ``Greeting cards that mingle Santas and menorahs, angels, trees,
stockings and Stars of David, are objectionable,'' the statement
said.
   ``My concern is that people are going to say, `Well, there are
these two winter holidays, what's the difference between them,
let's send out a kind of greeting card that will bridge the two,''
said Judith Banki, deputy director of the AJC's interreligious
affairs department.
   Banki, stressing that the groups aim to raise people's
consciousness and not accuse any particular company, cited three
examples she found in a store.
   One card showed a menorah with the words ``Holiday Greetings;''
inside the menorah was sitting atop a Christmas Tree. Another
showed two men of similar appearance side by side, one in a
yarmulke holding a menorah and one in Santa Claus garb, with the
words ``Have a splendid whatever.'' A third showed a Christmas
angel lighting a Hannukah menorah, which sat on a fireplace also
decorated with holly. That one read ``Happy Holidays.''
   Banki said two of the cards she cited were by Recycled Paper
Products Inc., of Chicago; the third was labeled Mixed Blessing, of
Scarsdale.
   ``I'm surprised they take exception to it on such rigid basis,
since this is a melting pot country,'' said Mike Keiser, co-owner
of Recycled Paper Products. ``I'd like to think there's room for
all kinds of religious expressions, even if they're polyglot
expressions.''
   Keiser, noting that he is Presbyterian and his partner, Phil
Friedmann, is Jewish, said their company has issued mixed cards for
at least five years to a large market and had never before heard a
complaint. But Keiser said he would take the organizations' appeal
into consideration.
   There was no listing for Mixed Blessing in the telephone
directory or with the Greeting Card Association in Washington.

<HL> 'Friend of Court' Rebuffed

   Just how friendly can friends of the court be with parties involved in litigation? 
That's what Blue Mountain Arts Inc. has asked an appeals court to determine in its battle with Hallmark Cards Inc. 

   In filings with the U.S. appeals court in Denver, Blue Mountain has accused Hallmark of disguising itself as an impartial, expert "friend of the court" in an effort to overturn an adverse ruling. 
In that ruling last year, a federal judge concluded that Hallmark had copied some of the smaller company's greeting cards, and then issued a preliminary injunction barring Hallmark from distributing 83 cards. 

   In a brief filed with the federal appeals court in Denver, the prestigious Society of Illustrators, a New York-based non-profit group, came out in support of Hallmark, arguing that specific styles shouldn't be monopolized. 
The group's more prominent members have included Norman Rockwell, cartoonist Rube Goldberg and Vernon Grant, creator of the Snap, Crackle, Pop characters on the Rice Krispies box. 

   The society's supporters also include Hallmark. 
According to court filings, the company picked the lawyers who wrote the society's friend of the court brief and paid the legal expenses. 
The greeting-card giant also has contributed $200,000 over the past four years to the group's scholarship program. 
None of those details were disclosed in the brief. 

   After uncovering Hallmark's role in the brief, lawyers for Blue Mountain called it a "sham" and "a fraud on the court" in documents filed with the court. 
The attorneys were tipped off when they found that one of the society's exhibits for the brief was stamped "Property of Hallmark Cards Creative Department." 

   In September, the appeals court tossed out the controversial brief, and Hallmark, soon after, forked over $25,000 to Blue Mountain to cover legal expenses in contesting the society's filing. 

   The court, however, didn't set any guidelines for what would make such a filing acceptable. 
Blue Mountain has asked the court to rule that any party filing a friend of the court brief must explicitly state its connection with the litigants. 

   Hallmark says that how it handled its role with the society "was perfectly appropriate." 
The society, meanwhile, says it's unlikely "we would have been able to state our position" without Hallmark's financial help.

accessories including gift bags and boxes.
   Net for the first half jumped 13% to $25.5 million, or 80
cents a share, from $22.5 million, or 70 cents a share.

   Hallmark Cards Inc. has announced that
it will sell its costume jewelry subsidiary to Crystal Brands Inc.
of Southport, Conn.
   Terms of the sale of Trifari, Krussman &amp; Fishel Inc. of New York
were not disclosed.
   Trifari, which has about 1,000 employees, was being sold because
Hallmark wanted to concentrate on larger companies and investments,
said Steve Doyal, a Hallmark spokesman.
   Hallmark bought Trifari in 1975 from the family that started the
company in 1925. At that time, Doyal said Trifari was a good
complement to Hallmark's composition as a greeting card and gift
company.
   Hallmark last year acquired a Spanish language television
network for $300 million. Its other subsidiaries include printing
and graphics companies, Crown Center Redevelopment Corp. and Binney

   A Washington woman may have helped
establish a national day for dad, but folks in this coal-mining
town claim they laid the groundwork.
   ``I'd like to describe it as a good-natured rivalry,'' said
Harold Goff, historian for the Central United Methodist Church,
which claims to have held the first Father's Day observance on July
5, 1908.
   ``We've established it using several well-documented books and
people who participated,'' Goff said. ``Even the greeting card
companies have been receptive. About the only outfit we've gotten
short shrift from is the national Father's Day Council.''
   Ted Kaufman, executive director of the non-profit council based
in New York, said he doesn't dispute that the town held the church
service honoring fathers.
   ``But as far as we're concerned, the first Father's Day
observance was in Spokane, Wash., by Sonora Smart Dodd in 1910,''
Kaufman said in a telephone interview. ``All we know is the
movement for a national Father's Day started from that event.''
   No matter who gets the credit, Hallmark Cards Inc. spokeswoman
Barbara Miller said sons and daughters nationwide will mail or
hand-deliver about 90 million Father's Day greeting cards this year.
   The holiday is the fifth-largest for greeting card manufacturers
behind Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mother's Day, the
spokeswoman said from company headquarters in Kansas City, Mo.
   Road signs declaring Fairmont the home of Father's Day and a
plaque marking the site of the first observance have been in place
in since 1984, when the town first began publicizing its claim.
   ``We've held Father's Day services continually since 1908, but
any attempt to get wider attention has kind of languished,'' Goff
said. ``We're not saying we're responsible for the national
holiday, just the first observance.''
   Mike Archer, a spokesman for the Spokane Chamber of Commerce,
said Woodrow Wilson first proclaimed Father's Day in 1916, based on
Mrs. Dodd's efforts.
   ``I guess we'll go with that to back up our claim,'' Archer said
in a telephone interview. ``We use it in our brochures about the
city.''
   Fairmont's claim centers on Mrs. Charles Clayton, who lobbied
the congregation of the Williams Memorial combined Methodist and
Episcopal Church to honor fathers after Mother's Day was celebrated
in nearby Grafton two months earlier.
   Now a dying railroad town of about 3,000, Grafton still receives
national publicity once a year as the site of the first Mother's
Day service.
   Mrs. Dodd's father was a Civil War veteran who raised her and
her five brothers alone after the death of his wife. She decided
fathers should be recognized, too, after hearing a sermon about
Mother's Day.
   Spokane celebrated Father's Day on June 19, 1910, Archer said.
   Kaufman said it was through Mrs. Dodd's continuing efforts that
Congress in 1972 _ 57 years after official commemoration of
Mother's Day _ declared the third Sunday in June to be Father's Day.
   There had been six previous one-shot official observances,
including Wilson's first proclamation.

   American Greetings Corp. reported that profit more than doubled for the fiscal second quarter, as the Cleveland company continues to benefit from last year's restructuring. 

   Net in the Aug. 31 quarter rose to $5 million, or 16 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or eight cents a share. 

   American Greetings reported its highest second-quarter revenue ever. 
Revenue rose 6.5% to $282.7 million from $265.4 million. 

   The greeting card company attributed its improved performance to last year's cost-savings measures, including the sale or closing of several subsidiaries. 
The company also said its "Couples" card line, introduced in July, had brisk sales. 

   American Greetings earned $22.5 million for the first half, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $576.4 million. 
For the like period last year, the company earned $17.8 million, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $568.6 million. 

   Its shares closed yesterday at $30.25, up 12.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.

   American Airlines announced it would buy up
to 100 Boeing 757-200s to replace aging aircraft in its fleet,
giving Boeing Co. its second multibillion-dollar order in as many
weeks.
   American officials said Wednesday they were ordering 50 757s for
delivery between July 1989 and November 1991, with an option to
purchase 50 more. The deal could be worth more than $4 billion to
Boeing.

   American Stores Co. agreed with federal
regulators not to buy any shares of Lucky Stores Inc. until
Saturday.
   A 10-day waiting period following filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of American Stores' $2.5 billion buyout bid for
Lucky, the country's sixth-largest grocery retailer, expired
Wednesday.
   But the Federal Trade Commission asked American Stores, the
nation's third-largest grocery chain, not to purchase any shares of
Lucky stock until Saturday so regulators could review any possible
antitrust implications of the merger.

   A federal appeals court upheld a ruling
temporarily forbidding Hallmark Cards Inc. from making greeting
card designs resembling those of a small competitor, clearing the
way for a full trial of the company's $50 million damage suit
against Hallmark.
   Blue Mountain Arts brought suit against Hallmark about two years
ago, alleging that Hallmark's ``Personal Touch'' line of greeting
cards is deceptively similar to their ``AireBrush Feelings'' and
``WaterColor Feelings'' lines.
   The appeals court ruling came Wednesday.

   The Houston-based company, which posted 1987 revenue of $14.8
billion, will use part of the proceeds from the sale to help pay
its hefty $8.5 billion debt, Tenneco spokeswoman Suzanne Thomas

employees are quitting because they find they have to work like
Westerners and get paid like East Europeans.
   Since the U.S. fast food chain opened its outlet in Belgrade in
March, 40 employees _ about one-third of its workers _ have
voluntarily left their jobs despite a high unemployment rate in
Yugoslavia.

FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: Old idea: new greeting - Keeping up with
the designer age is a challenge. Helen Lowry finds how the card industry is
coping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELEN LOWRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in the age of fax, telephones and communicating computers, there is
still no better - or more popular - way of communication than the greeting
card. According to the Greeting Card and Calendar Association, 2.427m cards
are sold each year in the UK alone.
Greeting cards are keeping pace with our increasingly design-oriented times.
Individual artists, craftsmen, photographers, illustrators and architects
are turning their hand to the art. Cards now display a range of design
techniques and there is a wealth of choice.
According to Christopher Cordingly, of Art Angels Publishers: 'It is a
heavily populated industry in which you have to carve your own niche.' He
looks for a distinctive style and images which have a universal appeal. Lucy
Clibbon is one of four recent art school graduates he has commissioned.
Initially inspired by a postcard made to illustrate her degree show, she now
has a range of 50 cards which are sold worldwide. She uses two techniques,
monoprinting and gesso (primal paint). Her gently humorous designs are full
of detail. 'Hand in Marriage' features a couple in traditional wedding dress
within the outline of a hand.
Surrounding them, and in the fingers, are hearts, champagne glasses, a
wedding cake, and various other objects associated with marriage.
Each Art Angels card is given a title and all are 'blank message' cards.
Improvement in reproduction quality has opened the market to numerous other
professionals.
Emma Tennant specialises in rag-rug making, a traditional craft in the south
of Scotland from where she comes. She describes the craft as 'the flip side
of patchwork'.
Using left-over bits of wool, in particular scrap tweed, she pulls them with
a hook through hessian. First transformed into wrapping paper, the bouncy
texture and vibrant colours are captured equally well in card form. Living
on a farm, Tennant's designs are inspired by looking out of the window.
It is partly the simplicity of her designs - a cat, sheep, pig or flowers -
which gives the cards their charm.
Michael Ashpool, of IMAI Design, also uses a traditional craft, the Japanese
paper-folding art of origami. He regularly makes trips to Japan to buy
'washi', vast sheets of hand-made, silk-screen paper.
He believes that 'an image must be simple and stand out'. His first, and
most popular design, is a miniature representation of the kimono, one of the
most recognisable and colourful of oriental images. His range also includes
a swan and butterfly, and can be bought at The Conran Shop (address below);
The British Museum, Bloomsbury, London WC1; and The Japan Centre,
Piccadilly, W1.
Individual ventures and contemporary designers are only one aspect of the
card market. Galleries and museums, as well as reproducing items from their
collections, are increasingly bringing out ranges to cover special
exhibitions.
The Victoria and Albert Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 2RL, has a large
and varied card selection, ranging from reproductions of William Morris
prints to hand-made cards by young contemporary artists.
They have produced a series of cards following the popular Fornasetti
exhibition. Black and white designs feature the classic Fornasetti woman.
Her smooth and expressionless face forms the head of a light bulb, a sun, or
just her eyes and nose are encompassed in a winding ribbon.
Fornasetti's colour drawings, although blank inside, have 'occasion' themes.
'Paloni', which depicts a sky scattered with hot air balloons, is an ideal
card for someone about to set off on a trip; 'Brindisi', the striking image
of a man and woman's arm crossing in the air, their glasses raised in a
celebratory gesture, could mark an anniversary or engagement.
The Design Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD, has a small but excellent
selection. Fold-out cards, created by Japanese architect Masahiro Chatani,
depict simple shapes, scenes or buildings. 'Dining Niche', a table and
chairs, captures the intimacy of a dinner. There are three-dimensional
representations of the Taj Mahal, a multi-tiered wedding cake, and an
abstract design entitled 'Blocks'. In contrast to this understated
collection, is a series of cards celebrating product-design throughout
history.
Each card is a bold cut-out. There is, among others, a pop-inspired
Valentine Typewriter, bright red and toy-like; a Predicta Television, one of
the most famous images of post-war industrial design; and a classic 1930s
BMW motor-cycle.
Art Angels cards are available at Liberty of Regent Street, London W1; The
Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3; The General Trading Company, 144
Sloane Street, London SW1; The Medici Gallery, 7 Grafton Street, London W1;
and The Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, London SW7.
Emma Tennant cards, published by Frederica Freer Greeting Cards, are
available at: The General Trading Company; Graham &amp; Greene, 4 Elgin
Crescent, London W11; The Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square,
London SW1; The Chelsea Gardener, 125 Sydney Street, London SW3; Dartington
Cider Press (Devon); The Village Bakery (Cumbria) and the National Trust.

YOUNG CANCER PATIENTS DELIVER 'GLAD TIDINGS'

Stacie Smith looks like a typical 9-year-old. She wears fashionable clothing 
and a smile from ear to ear that could make any Christmas Grinch smirk. 
</P>
<P>
But at her young age, Stacie has endured three years of cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
With her illness diagnosed as acute lymphocytic leukemia, Stacie has received 
chemotherapy, undergone bone-marrow spinal-tap aspirations and had a tube 
inserted in her chest to receive her medicine. Having completed her treatment, 
Stacie is now in remission. The pretty girl with long, shiny hair now enjoys 
horseback riding, swimming, soccer and softball. 
</P>
<P>
A cancer diagnosis can be devastating, not only for the victim but also for the 
entire family. This is where the Kids Cancer Connection Inc. steps in to help. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based program, founded by parents whose children have suffered 
cancer, helps families deal with the pain of the disease, assists children 
returning to school during and after treatments, provides scholarships for 
children requiring continuing education and supports cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids Cancer Connection's primary fund-raising program, the "Glad Tidings" 
holiday greeting-card program, is currently under way. 
</P>
<P>
The program is now in its second year of operation, and this year's cards have 
been colorfully designed by Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles County children 
being treated for cancer. The cards contain original inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Stacie's greeting card features a fluffy lamb looking hopefully at the North 
Star. The sentiment inside says, "Do you hear what I hear . . .?" This is the 
second year Stacie has contributed artwork to the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we did about $220,000 worth in sales," said Michele Massey, 
executive director of the Kids Cancer Connection. "Last month alone we sold 
$65,000." 
</P>
<P>
A committee chooses artwork. The prospective artists are sent instructions, and 
when all the artwork is received, Massey and a group of volunteers select the 
ones that will be printed. 
</P>
<P>
Massey has already received letters inquiring about submitting designs for next 
year's cards. A letter from a parent in San Marcos read: "My son has cancer. He 
wanted to know maybe next year if he could send in a design." 
</P>
<P>
The cards are available at the Orange County Marketplace, on the Orange County 
Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa; I. Magnin and Bernans, both in South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa; and South County Re/Max offices. Orders can also be sent directly 
to the Kids Cancer Connection. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call (714) 851-7774. 
</P>
<P>
The Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation in Orange also offers holiday greeting 
cards created by children with cancer. Funds from the cards are used for 
research conducted at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairwoman Bonnie Dankberg thinks the foundation, now in its fourth year of 
greeting-card sales, will sell 145,000 cards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cards are available at Nordstrom and Vons Pavilion stores throughout Orange and 
Los Angeles counties and at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory office on 
the second floor of CHOC Tower in Orange.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATOR ASKS FIRM TO PULL GREETING CARD OFF 
SHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state lawmaker has asked a Burbank greeting card company to withdraw a card 
from stores that he says is demeaning to victims of sexual assault and to 
women. 
</P>
<P>
The card, printed by The Thought Factory card company, has a drawing of a 
police officer and says: "Prevent sexual assault. Cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who noticed the card while browsing in a 
Santa Clara County store, said this week that he "immediately saw red." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Pierson, sales manager for The Thought Factory, said the firm no longer 
sells the card "because we did feel it was offensive. . . . It had been brought 
to our attention." 
</P>
<P>
But Pierson said the company does not plan to remove the card from retail 
stores because "we never had that big a distribution of it. I can't tell them 
(the stores) to pull it. . . . I don't get into that kind of form of 
censorship."

<HEADLINE>  POET HIRES OUT TO GIVE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS
VOICE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Milt Brewster, a San Jose computer programmer, and a group of co-workers,
stumbled over a similar hitch in plans to honor a departing manager.;    "He
had been good to all of us and we wanted to let him know he was a pretty good
guy, but we didn't want to just get a regular old greeting card," Brewster
said.;    And when Patrick Toledo learned that his friend was chronically ill,
he too yearned to express gratitude to the ailing educator and Toledo's
personal mentor.;    "He talked to me about truth and how little of it there
is around. What I learned meant a great deal to me. I couldn't put that into
words," said Toledo, a janitor at San Jose State University.;    In the three
failures to find the perfect phrases of love, Paula Finn saw the opportunity
to make rhyme pay.;    For a fee, the Sunnyvale poet penned verses to order
and soothed the souls of Tierney, Brewster and Toledo, who were otherwise
unable to express their heartfelt sentiments. To get their feelings across
Tierney paid Finn $25, Brewster forked over $50 and to Toledo the service was
worth $75.;    "It's for people who can't say what they want to. It is a very
unusual and touching gift when a person realizes the verses were written
especially for them, to make them happy or to show them how much they are
appreciated," said the published author of several best-selling greeting cards
and two books of poetry.;    Finn has no qualms about choosing money as her
Muse and prefers to call her writing, "commercial sensitivity verse," not
poetry.;    The verse doesn't actually rhyme, but it is easier to grasp than
metaphor, simile and iambic pentameter, and most importantly, it pays the
bills.;    Typically, the doe-eyed poet with a penchant for playing Cupid
begins the creative process by interviewing a client to determine what he or
she wants to say. Based on the interview, she writes a few trial verses and
subsequent interviews, if necessary, serve to hone the verse. Eventually the
client feels as if Finn's handiwork is his or her own.;    "I listen and get a
feel for the tone they want to convey. I also show some samples of my work. I
was a writer for a resume service and I've done feature articles for South Bay
Accent Magazine, so I'm pretty good at interviewing," says the Cyrano de
Bergerac of the greeting card set.;    Toledo says Finn interviewed him for
about 40 minutes.;    "I talked about what we were about, he as professor and
I as a janitor. I wanted this man to know his time wasn't in vain. I never
thought I would meet a professor who would take me as an 'honor student' under
his wing," he said.;    For the effort he got a small volume of verse penned
with calligraphy on parchment which he later had bonded to a plaque.;   
"Paula's poetry talked about truth and how little of it there is around and
how he shared it with me even after he became ill," Toledo said.;    Brewster,
once a graphic artist, planned to design an over-sized greeting card for the
outgoing manager and hired Finn to write meaningful prose to fill in the
blanks.;    The poet's fees are based on the length of what she writes and its
presentation, rather than the time it can take to pen the poems -- $25 for a
few simple verses to as much as $100 or more for calligraphy, parchment paper
and treatment.;    She diversified into personalized poetry after writing two
$9.95 hardcover gift books "Our Lives Were Meant to be Shared," and "When Love
Isn't Easy," both published this past February by Mark Publishing Inc. in
Scotts Valley. Both 48-page books were illustrated by Cupertino a water color
artist, Floy Zittin.;    Finn has been waxing remunerative with her lyrical,
free verse since 1981, when she began penning for Boulder, Colo.-based Blue
Mountain Arts, the international greeting card company known for its
airbrushed pastels and free verse about relationships.;    Similar me-to-you
expressions of caring by Finn also have been etched on calendars, coffee mugs,
magnets, plaques and similar gifts.;    "I write about what I would like to
receive. My specialty is mending relationships. People who like my work say
I'm very sensitive. I get told that so many times, I'm starting to believe
it," Finn said.;    Not formally educated as a poet, Finn graduated Phi Beta
Kappa with a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology from University of
California, Los Angeles, but was influenced by her father, a television script
writer, who has "The Honeymooners" and "The Flintstones" scripts in his
portfolio.;    As a teen in the '60s, Finn became a finalist in a
lyric-writing contest for a Los Angeles radio station and "I wrote long
metaphoric, symbolic stuff that did not come right out and say what I meant.
It was called psychedelic peace poetry," she said.;    After trying her hand
at journalism, business and resume writing and briefly at teaching business
English at San Jose City College, Finn discovered the work of a friend of her
sister who had a knack for adding lyrical prose to blank greeting cards.;   
"It was something new and people responded to it more than to other cards. To
know I'm touching people's lives is very important to me. I can't think of a
better way to apply my love of writing," Finn said.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
For information call Paula Finn at (408) 736-4058.;     'WHEN LOVE ISN'T
EASY'; We can grow closer . . .; By accepting our differences; and expressing
them,; we can grow closer.; By resisting our differences; and denying them,;
we will grow apart.; Conflict can; enhance our relationship; . . . or it can
destroy it.; -- Paula Finn  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Presidential Christmas Card Depicts White House Main Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President and Nancy Reagan's 1988 White House
Christmas card, released on Thursday, depicts a colorful holiday
scene of the executive mansion's main hall, with evergreen-draped
marble columns and a table decorated with red poinsettias.
   Some 125,000 of the cards will be mailed out on Dec. 14, the
White House said in a statement accompanying a photograph of the
card.
   The card features a reproduction of a watercolor by the American
artist Thomas William Jones, of Bellevue, Wash. It was the fourth
time the artist was asked to paint a picture for the holiday
greeting card by the president and first lady.
   The painting, entitled ``North Entry Hall at Christmas,'' shows
boughs of evergreens draping the white marble columns of the Cross
Hall, the great hall that leads from the State Dining Room to the
East Room.
   Through the columns, a table purchased by former President Monroe
can be seen, decorated with evergreens and red bows and red
poinsettias.
   The inside of the card carries a greeting in gold engraved
script, ``The President and Mrs. Reagan extend to you warm wishes
that your holidays and the coming year will be filled with happiness
and peace.''
   The presidential seal is embossed in white above the greeting and
1988 below it.
   The five-by-eight-inch card is printed on white paper with a
deckle edge on the bottom.
   Last year, Jones painted a view of the State Dining Room, and has
in other years painted pictures of the East Room and the Blue Room.
   The White House said the cards were printed at cost by Hallmark
and that the Republican National Committee paid the printing and
mailing costs.

<HEAD>High-Tech Christmas Cards A Hit In Japan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report. Store name Tokyu Hands in 4th

<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They stand up, they sing, they flicker on and off.
   Ingenuity and high technology have led to some unusual Christmas
cards, which retailers say are a big hit with Japanese holiday
shoppers this year.
   Take, for example, the card that unfolds into an upright
Christmas tree, complete with blinking red lights and a two-tune
repertoire of ``Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer'' and ``Santa Claus
Is Coming to Town.''
   ``It's very big with 18- to 25-year-old women this year,'' said
Takehiro Ushishima of the sales promotion department at Tokyu Hands,
a popular store for hobby goods.
   The songs are stored in a tiny integrated circuit that is
activated by a light sensor when the card is opened. The cost is
about $15.
   Tokyu Hands has already sold out of cards made with real gold
costing upwards of $3.
   ``The most popular new cards this year are those that come with
compact discs,'' Ushishima said. The discs feature one or two
Christmas tunes and are often decorated to match the cards they are
sold with.
   High-tech cards are decidedly upscale, averaging over $8 each, or
more than four times the price of the conventional printed card.
   ``But this year card makers in general have been more
elaborate,'' bringing up the average price, Ushishima said.
   Christians are a 1 percent minority in Japan, where Buddhism and
the indigenous Shinto faiths are most common, and Christmas is not a
national holiday. However, many Japanese non-Christians celebrate
Christmas by having parties, exchanging gifts or eating special
foods.
   ``Sales of Christmas cards are now at their peak,'' said Ichiro
Saito, public relations director of Itoya, a major stationery store
in the swank Ginza district.
   ``It's been a good year for Christmas cards because of the
emperor's illness,'' Saito said.
   Emperor Hirohito, 87, has been seriously ill since Sept. 19,
causing a mood of self-restraint in the public, including a slump in
the sale of New Year's greeting cards.
   It appears that Christmas cards are more popular because their
neutral message of ``Season's Greetings'' is more appropriate than
``Happy New Year,'' Saito said.

<HL> Hallmark Reaches Pact In Dispute on Card Lines </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> KANSAS CITY, Mo.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. said it reached an agreement to settle a two-year dispute involving a line of its cards that resemble those of Blue Mountain Arts, a small Boulder, Colo., concern. 

   As previously reported, Blue Mountain sued Hallmark for trademark violations, contending that its Personal Touch line of cards was too similar to Blue Mountain Arts' products. 
Last week, the Supreme Court left intact a preliminary injunction that barred Hallmark from selling 83 "Personal Touch" cards. 

   As part of the settlement, Hallmark said it will introduce a greeting card line with a new name that will replace the Personal Touch line and agrees not to infringe Blue Mountain's trade dress. 
Under the pact, neither company makes any admission of any liability or wrongdoing. 

   In Boulder, Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain Arts, said the company is elated that its creative designs are protected and that "we can get back to publishing cards without fear of being copied." 
Mr. Gall said Blue Mountain publishes about 100 different cards under the lines it had charged Hallmark with copying. 

   Although Blue Mountain originally had sought $276 million in actual and punitive damages from Hallmark, Mr. Gall wouldn't comment on the financial terms, if any, of its agreement with Hallmark.

<HL> Business Brief:
Russ Berrie &amp; Co.</HL>

<IN> RUS </IN>
<TEXT>
   Russ Berrie &amp; Co., Oakland, N.J., said a federal jury ordered it to pay $4.3 million to a former licensor, which will result in a charge of about $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share. 

   The jury, in federal court in Illinois, awarded the damages to Georgia Roulo, a former licensor of the toy, trinket and greeting card firm. 
Ms. Roulo sued Russ Berrie in 1982, contending that the company's line of "Touching You" greeting cards infringed on the "Feeling Sensitive" cards she designed for Russ Berrie to sell from 1978 through 1980. 

   Russ Berrie distributed its "Touching You" cards from 1980 until October 1987, when they were discontinued for reasons unrelated to the suit. 

   The company said it considers the verdict "erroneous" and the damages "excessive." 
It said it would contest them through post-trial motions and appeal, if necessary. 

   A. Curts Cooke, a spokesman for the company, said the $2.5 million charge, to be written against the company's earnings for the fourth quarter, represents less than 10% of the earnings for the year, but declined to comment on whether it would affect dividends. 
The firm has been paying a dividend of 10 cents a quarter. 
For 1986, the company earned $30.4 million, or $2.05 a share.

<BYLINE>BRIGHT IDEA: GE Expands In Eastern Europe With Light Bulb Venture</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   BUDAPEST, Hungary - As hammers and saws drone in the background,
George Varga spins his vision of how General Electric Co. will
increase its stake in the European lightbulb business while
benefiting from the newly opened markets of the East. The beachhead
is Tungsram, a light bulb company once owned by the government of
Hungary. GE bought control of Tungsram last November for $150
million in the largest U.S. investment in Hungary since World War
II, and it's Varga's job to turn things around.

<BYLINE>TAKING IT TO THE BANK: The Wild Ride of Silverado</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   DENVER - Silverado was a shooting star - a spectacular burnout
that left little but a sleek skyscraper in downtown Denver, a $1
billion bill for the taxpayers, and a raging controversy
surrounding one of its directors. The director is Neil Bush, son of
the president; this week, he faces hearings on government
allegations of a conflict of interest in the demise of the thrift.
But Silverado is more than the story of George's boy. It is a tale
of profligate spending and lending, of three-card monte played with
millions. It is, in fact, the savings and loan fiasco in
not-so-miniature.
