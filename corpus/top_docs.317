   Typhoon Koryn headed
north of this U.S. island commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean on
Monday with winds gusting to 110 mph, and forecasters believed the
storm had hit its peak, officials said.
   On Guam, crews worked to clear damage and restore water and
power service cut when the storm hit Sunday night.
   By noon Monday (9 p.m. Sunday EST), Koryn's center was 40 miles
north of Saipan, and the storm was moving north-northeast at 8 mph,
said Navy Lt. Diane Crittenden of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
on Guam.
   The typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and gusts
reaching 110 mph, was believed to have reached its peak, she said.
   If the storm kept to its course, it would not hit any other
islands in the Northern Marianas, but might hit the Japanese island
of Minami-Tori, according to Ms. Crittendon.
   Residents on Saipan boarded up houses, put boats to sea and
moved to community shelters, said Civil Defense coordinator Felix
Sasamopo. The airport was closed.
   On Guam, water service was restored to about 40 percent of the
island's population of 130,000, and 40 percent remained without
electricity, said Ben Reyes, a staff officer with Guam Civil
Defense.
   Winds tore tin roofs off two houses in Guam and forced more than
500 people into emergency shelters Sunday, but only a few remained
in shelters after the storm passed, said Reyes. Two minor injuries
were reported.
   The Guam airport was reopened after the typhoon passed. Guam is
also home to Andersen Air Force Base.
   Both Guam and the Northern Marianas are located west of the
International Date Line.

   The Internal Revenue Service notified Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands that interest on $380 million of municipal bonds issued by the two Pacific jurisdictions isn't tax-exempt. 

   But the IRS made it clear it hasn't reached the point of moving to tax interest income earned by bondholders. 

   The Territory of Guam sold $300 million of bonds as tax-exempt securities in October 1985. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands sold $80 million of bonds as tax-exempts in December 1984. 
Both issues were underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc. 

   A U.S. grand jury in Guam late last year cited the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands bond issues, among others, in a 52-count indictment charging Matthews &amp; Wright Executive Vice President Arthur Abba Goldberg and a one-time company consultant with promoting a nationwide fraud involving more than $2 billion in municipal bonds. 
Mr. Goldberg has pleaded innocent. 
His trial isn't expected to get under way until next year. 
The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

   "After thorough consideration, we have concluded that interest on the (Guam) bonds is not tax-exempt under section 103 of the Code," IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs told Guam Gov. Joseph Ada in a letter. 
The same message was delivered to Gov. Pedro Tenorio of the Northern Mariana Islands. 

   The action wasn't wholly unexpected. 
Gov. Ada told a congressional panel earlier this year that the IRS was going to declare the $300 million issue taxable. 

   IRS officials have refused to discuss the bonds in question, and a spokesman declined yesterday to comment on the issues. 
Officials of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands couldn't be reached immediately for comment. 

   Attorney David Aufhauser of Williams &amp; Connolly, Matthews &amp; Wright's law firm, emphasized the view that the IRS's conclusions are "only preliminary." 
He said Matthews &amp; Wright is confident the IRS's conclusions will be "reconsidered and changed" in due course. 

   The IRS said in the letters, "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through the use of a closing agreement," explaining that under such agreements, "the service forgoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholder but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands separately have filed lawsuits against parties involved in the issuance of the bonds, including Matthews &amp; Wright.

   Typhoon Koryn, packing sustained winds of 75
mph and gusts to 90 mph, swept past this U.S. Pacific territory
Sunday night before heading toward the Northern Mariana Islands,
authorities said.
   High winds and heavy rains knocked out electricity over 30
percent of Guam, cutting power to 56 of the island's 90 water
wells, officials said.
   Winds ranging from 35 to 55 mph ripped tin roofs off two houses
and forced 21 people into emergcy shelters, the officials said.
   There were two reports of minor injuries. A 50-year-old man
suffered a cut ear while trying to put up shutters and a
46-year-old woman was injured when she was blown into a pole. Both
were treated and released from Guam Memorial Hospital, a hospital
spokesman said.
   As of 7 p.m. (4 a.m. EST), Koryn was 44 miles northeast of Guam,
moving to the northwest at 8 mph, according to Navy Lt.j.g. Ken
Minogue of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   The typhoon was forecast to pass to the north of Rota, the most
southern of the Northern Marianas, a U.S. commonwealth, some 40
miles north of Guam, Minogue said.
   Rota was getting heavy rains and winds up to 50 mph, the same
conditions the Mariana islands of Tinian and Saipan could expect
Monday, he said.
   On Guam, all Navy aircraft were placed in hangers for protection
against the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea
to weather the storm, said Lt. Dave Lee. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   Twelve planes, including 11 B-52s, at Andersen Air Force Base on
the north coast of Guam, were parked behind fortifications as the
storm approached, said base spokesman Capt. Wayne Perry.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.

   Typhoon Russ raked Guam today with wind up to
135 mph and pummeled the U.S. territory's southern coast with huge
waves that caused severe flooding.
   No serious injuries or deaths were reported, but power and water
service were disrupted in many areas and police reported some
looting, Ken Booth of Guam Cable TV said.
   The storm was the strongest to hit this western Pacific island
in more than a decade. Its eye moved within 15 miles of Guam's
southern coast early today, and wind hit 135 mph in the south and
90 mph with gusts of 115 mph in central and northern areas, said
Lt. Diane Edson of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   Fifteen minor injuries and no deaths were reported, Booth said.
   ``It was quite a blow, but not as bad as had been expected,'' he
said.
   Gov. Joseph Ada said about 500 families in the southern town of
Agat were displaced, Booth reported. About 2,500 people sought
shelter during the storm.
   Power and water service remained down in many areas, and
officials said it would be three days before full power was
restored, according to Booth.
   Booth said police reported looting in some areas. The duty-free
store in the central town of Tumon reported being robbed of
$250,000 in Rolex watches and an undetermined amount of other
jewelry. There were reports of looting in other areas as well. No
arrests were made.
   Waves cresting as high as 24 feet caused severe flooding in
southern Guam, uncovering corpses in the cemetery in the town of
Inarajan, Booth said.
   Several large concrete utility poles installed after the last
major typhoon, Pamela in 1976, snapped in half from the force of
the waves, Booth said.
   Russ damaged or destroyed only the few wooden homes remaining on
the island. Concrete structures built after Pamela escaped serious
damage.
   Ada said he planned to ask for federal disaster relief
assistance.
   Booth said the capital of Agana looked like a ``war zone,'' with
trees, traffic lights, poles and signs strewn about and flooding
everywhere.
   The storm center was out to sea and headed toward the
Philippines with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts of 175 mph,
Edson said. It was moving at 15 mph, but was expected to weaken
before it reached the Philippines.

   Typhoon Koryn, packing
110 mph gusts, knocked down trees and cut electrical power in the
capital of this U.S. commonwealth before moving away today,
authorities said.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported.
   The typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph swept past
Saipan and was moving to the northeast at 8 mph, said Air Force
Maj. Joel Martin, a meteorologist with the Guam-based Joint Typhoon
Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   As of 4 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), Koryn was 65 miles north of Saipan,
Martin said.
   There were reports of downed trees and power lines before
communications were cut with Saipan, Martin said, but added the
storm's path ``seemed to have spared them a lot of the heavier
winds.''
   Forecasters predicted the typhoon would not affect any other
islands before it lost power.
   The winds damaged power lines, cutting electricity on the island
Sunday night, said Jean-Louis M. Pierrefeu, assistant executive
director for the Commonwealth Utilities Corp.'s power branch.
   As the storm approached, residents boarded up houses, put boats
to sea and moved to shelters, said Civil Defense coordinator Felix
Sasamopo. The airport was closed.
   Conditions on Rota, the most southern of the Marianas, were not
known because of poor communications, Martin said.
   The first island to feel the typhoon was Guam, just to the south
of the Northern Marianas.
   Koryn skirted the U.S. territory to the west Sunday night with
heavy rains and 90 mph gusts, knocking out power and sending more
than 500 people to shelters. Without electricity, the island's
130,000 residents were without water.
   By tonight, electricity had been restored to at least 65 percent
of Guam and 50 percent of the island had running water, said Ben
Reyes, of the Guam Civil Defense.
   Island residents had been warned to keep a three-day supply of
water, Reyes said.
   All of the people who had sought shelter had returned to their
homes except for the 59 members of four families, who were provided
emergency housing, he said.
   Updated reports showed four people suffered minor injuries from
the storm, while the tin roofs of two houses were blown off, Reyes
said.

   Residents of this U.S. territory were advised
to stock up on emergency supplies as a powerful typhoon stalled 200
miles to the east.
   Typhoon Jack, unusually late in the season for a major storm,
had sustained winds of 125 mph with gusts to 155 mph at 1 a.m.
Wednesday and was gradually weakening, according to the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center.
   Forecasters said the typhoon was expected to drift slowly toward
the northwest during the next 18 to 24 hours on a course that would
take it 57 miles north of Saipan.
   Before it stalled in the western Pacific, the storm had been on
a track that would take it between Guam and Saipan, the capital of
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands north of Guam.
   ``The potential for erratic movement is high,'' said hourly
advisories issued by the center.
   The Air Force sent B-52 bombers to Okinawa and the Navy ordered
its large ships to sea to ride out the storm, officials said.
   Banks closed today and the 125,000 residents of Guam and the
30,000 people on Saipan were advised to get supplies of food,
water, batteries and the like.
   Guam is under a Tropical Cyclone Condition 2, meaning a storm
could hit the island within 24 hours.

   A weakening Typhoon Jack began to drift
toward this U.S. territory in the western Pacific today and was
forecast to at least brush the island on Friday, according to civil
defense officials.
   At 1 a.m. Thursday, (10 a.m. today EST), the storm was 190 miles
east of Guam, moving west-southwest at about 3 mph. Its sustained
wind speed was 85 mph with gusts to 100 mph. On Tuesday, its
sustained winds were 135.
   Lt. Richard Bouchard of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center here
said at the rate the storm was weakening it could lose typhoon
status _ sustained wind speed of at least 74 mph _ before it passes
south of Guam.
   ``Forecasters can't determine how close it will come, but it's
expected to pass Guam during the day Friday,'' said George Toves, a
Guam Civil Defense officer. ``We'll get some portion of it.''
   The storm had been stalled about 200 miles east of Guam since
early Tuesday.

   Typhoon Andy, packing winds reaching 185 mph,
sent 1,100 people fleeing to shelters and forced the military to
ferry 17 airplanes to Hawaii as a precautionary measure,
authorities said.
   There were no reports of major structural damage or injuries
associated with the storm, according to police officer John
Thornton.
   As of this afternoon, the center of the typhoon with sustained
winds of 155 mph was located 113 miles east-southeast of Guam,
moving to the northeast at 10 mph, the Joint Typhoon Weather Center
said.
   The typhoon was expected to head into the Northern Mariana
Islands, bypassing Rota by 115 miles, before missing Tinian and the
capital city of Saipan by 155 miles, the center said.
   Guam, a U.S. territory with a population of 105,000, is the
largest of the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific.
   Earlier today, Guam was hit with 50 mph winds and gusts to 65
mph that knocked out 15 percent of the island's electric power for
a few hours.
   Thornton described the weather as ``not too bad.'' He said,
``You feel it in small cars when you're driving.''
   However, the island's banana and mango crops were hard hit, Guam
Cablevision reported.
   About half of the U.S. territory's schools were being used as
shelters, Thornton said.

   Typhoon Russ damaged or destroyed more than
2,000 homes and injured 88 people in this U.S. territory in the
Western Pacific, but no one was killed, officials said.
   The storm, packing wind that gusted up to 150 mph, swept over
the island of 145,000 residents on Friday.
   Gov. Joseph Ada on Saturday sent a letter to President Bush,
requesting a disaster declaration to release federal funds to help
in the recovery.
   A disaster declaration from Bush is unlikely for several days,
said Bart Stinson, a Civil Defense spokesman. There was no
immediate estimate of total damage, he said.
   Electricity and water service had been restored to about 20
percent of Guam by Sunday morning, Stinson said. Telephone service,
however, remained intact because most of the cables are buried, he
said.
   Stinson said damage to Guam Community College, which is adjacent
to Guam University, was extensive.
   ``It looks more like a tornado hit it than a typhoon,'' he said.
   The wooden buildings were splintered and desks strewn around the
campus, where trees were twisted and not just blown down, he said.
   Ada said a preliminary survey by Federal Emergency Management
Agency teams found 341 homes destroyed, 460 with major damage and
1,210 with minor damage to the point they were uninhabitable.
   Hospitals reported treating 88 people, mostly for punctures,
cuts and scratches from wind-blown debris.
   The FEMA teams were already on Guam when Typhoon Russ hit. They
had come to coordinate recovery operations on islands in the
Federated States of Micronesia that were hit by Typhoon Owen three
weeks ago.

   Tropical storm Koryn became a full-fledged
typhoon Sunday, lashing this U.S. Pacific territory with strong
winds and heavy rains, toppling trees and flooding low-lying areas,
authorities said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to
structures.
   As of 5 p.m. (2 a.m. EST), Koryn had sustained winds of 75 mph,
with gusts to 90 mph, according to Navy Lt. Joe Atangan of the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   The storm's center was located 45 miles east of the northern tip
of the island, where Andersen Air Force Base is located, Atangan
said.
   The typhoon was ``quasi stationary'' but was expected to move
off to the north-northwest, skirting the northern coast, he said.
   Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands remained under a typhoon
alert, although the projected path of the storm would take it south
of the Marianas and away from any other islands, Atangan said.
   There were reports on Guam of intermittent power outages because
of downed lines, and flooding was reported in many areas, the
Pacific Daily News said.
   ``There's lots of coconuts on the roads,'' Atangan said.
   All Navy aircraft were placed in hangers for protection against
the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea to
weather the storm, said Lt. Dave Lee. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   The 12 planes at Andersen, including 11 B-52s, were parked
behind fortifications as the storm approached, said base spokesman
Capt. Wayne Perry.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.

   Typhoon Owen bore
down Thursday on Yap after killing two men and leaving more than

republic.
   The storm passed 20 miles south of the island of Woleai, but
there was no immediate word on the fate of the 300 residents, a

   Owen, with sustained winds of 130 mph and gusts to 160 mph,

island of Yap late Friday, said Lt. j.g. Richard Jeffries of the
Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center on Guam. Yap island has about
12,000 residents.
   Micronesia is in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator
and south of Guam, a U.S. territory. The principal island groups
include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, the
Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Two men were electrocuted Saturday by downed power lines when
the typhoon toppled a tree in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei,
said Tony Palomo, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Interior
on Guam.
   The typhoon lashed the state of Truk's sparcely-populated outer
islands with 125 mph winds Wednesday, destroying many homes, said
Ismael Dobich, a Truk state spokesman. No injuries were reported.
   Truk is about 1,488 miles southeast of Guam.

   Guam Gov. Joseph Ada said the Internal Revenue Service soon will declare taxable a $300 million Guam housing-bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc. 

   Gov. Ada told a House Interior subcommittee he met with the IRS last week on the bonds' tax status, and said, "They are coming out and declaring the $300 million (issue) taxable soon." 

   An attorney for Matthews &amp; Wright, a small Wall Street bond house, said he had no information on any IRS decision to tax the Guam bonds. 
A senior IRS official declined all comment on the matter. 

   The Guam bonds were issued as tax-exempt securities in 1985. 

   Two authorities on municipal bonds said they couldn't remember the IRS's having declared an issue taxable retroactively. 

   "I don't think it has ever happened," said James Lebenthal, president of the New York bond firm Lebenthal &amp; Co. Richard Ciccarone, senior research analyst of Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a Chicago, Ill., securities concern, said he couldn't recall it happening in his more than 10 years in the business.

   Residents waited behind boarded windows or
fled to shelters early Friday while Typhoon Russ battered the
island with winds topping 100 mph.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials
said.
   Russ was the strongest typhoon to hit this western Pacific
island in more than a decade. It toppled trees, pushed surf to more
than 20 feet high and made movement around the 30-mile-long island
virtually impossible.
   ``Everybody's just sitting tight,'' Guam Civil Defense spokesman
Mike Franquez said. ``We'll wait for the winds to pass and then
assess the damage.''
   About 145,000 people live on Guam. The last storm to cause major
damage here was Typhoon Pamela in 1976.
   Winds were clocked at 90 mph with gusts to 115 mph when the
storm made its closest pass before dawn, said Navy Capt. Dieter
Rudolph, commander of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   The wind readings were taken at the typhoon center, near the
north end of north-south lying island. The storm's center brushed
Guam's south coast, and southern areas were pummelled by the
strongest winds.
   The storm's maximum sustained winds were 145 mph, with gusts to
175 mph, Rudolph said. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.
   About 2,300 people went to shelters at schools. The windows of
most buildings had been boarded up, Franquez said.
   To avert the potential problem of dangling live wires if power
lines break, electricity was shut off to most of the island. Water
also was cut off. Some coastal roads were closed because the high
surf left them strewn with debris.
   ``There's downed power lines, downed trees, flooded streets,''
said Dave Ecret of KGUM Radio. ``It's just an eerie kind of
feeling.''

<HEAD>Executive Gets 18 Months in Mail Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street executive who pleaded guilty to
three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former
governor of Guam has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis on Monday also placed Arthur
Abba Goldberg on five years' probation, fined him $100,000 and
ordered him to repay the United States $300,000.
   Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, pleaded guilty July 14 to
three counts of mail fraud.
   He had been accused of funneling $70,000 to former Guam Gov.
Ricardo J. Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election campaign. In
exchange, Bordallo allegedly agreed to generate support for a $300
million housing bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February 1986 of accepting bribes from
Goldberg but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87.
   Goldberg had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a
$750,000 fine in addition to restitution payments, according to
William O'Connor, the U.S. attorney from Guam.
   The three counts referred to money bilked from the Guam Program
Development Fund and a ``lulling letter'' assuring fund authorities
that the transactions were legal.
   A December 1987 indictment charged Goldberg with preparing phony
invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.
   The bank paid the money to Goldberg, who spent $25,000 to buy
campaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ for
Bordallo's unsuccessful re-election bid, O'Connor has said.
   Authorities said Goldberg made his contributions after Bordallo
was promised that he would receive campaign contributions if he
supported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved by
the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp; Wright has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In exchange for Goldberg's guilty pleas, 46 other counts
alleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud were
dismissed. The case was moved from Guam, 3,800 miles west of
Hawaii, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.
   Twelve of the original counts against Goldberg were related
directly to Guam. The balance referred to fraud involving the use
of the Commercial Bank of Americas in transactions that did not
involve the U.S. territory.
   In August 1987, Gov. Joseph Ada sued Matthews &amp; Wright for the
return of $14 million in fees the firm had received, as well as
$250 million in punitive damages. O'Connor said in July the suit
had been settled, but he released no details.

   Typhoon Owen, a fierce storm with 125 mph
winds, slammed into the Federated States of Micronesia today,
killing two people and leaving more than 1,000 people homeless,
officials said.
   The two men were killed in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei
when they were electrocuted by downed power lines, said Tony
Palomo, a representative of the Guam Department of the Interior.
   Early reports estimated that well over 1,000 people were left
homeless after the powerful storm packing winds of 125 mph and
gusts of 155 mph battered the outer islands of Pulap, Ruo, Nomwin,
Fananu, Murilo and Tamatam in the state of Chuuk, said Ismael
Dobich, public affairs director of Chuuk.
   Each island has about 500 residents. Micronesia is in the
western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. The principal island
groups include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islnads,
the Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Owen destroyed nearly every home on Pulap and Ruo, Dobich said.
The entire banana, coconut, taro and bread fruit crops were
destroyed on Ruo, Dobich.
   ``In Pulap, all of the homes were destroyed with the exception
of one concrete structure,'' Dobich said. Most of the homes were
made of wood and tin.
   Owen was expected to regain supertyphoon status by late Thursday
or early Friday, with forecasters predicting winds of 150 mph and
gusts to 180 mph.
   Guam, 1,488 miles from Chuuk, remains on a typhoon alert status.
Owen was about 405 miles south of Guam, an American territory,
Wednesday morning.

   A federal judge today struck down Guam's
virtual ban on abortion as unconstitutional. The measure was the
nation's most restrictive abortion law.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the mother's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Two days after the law went into effect, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer, Janet Benshoof of New York, was charged
with violating the measure by publicly encouraging women to seek
abortions in Hawaii. The charges later were dropped; prosecutors
said the lawsuit challenging the law was a higher priority.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal
today's ruling.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   The challenge to the law was brought by an unidentified pregnant
woman who wanted an abortion, the Guam Society of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.
   Anita Arriola, a lawyer for the abortion-rights side, had argued
that the law _ introduced by her mother, territorial Sen. Elizabeth
Arriola _ was contrary to Roe vs. Wade and was passed to promote a
particular religious belief.
   Katherine A. Maraman, representing the government of this U.S.
possession in the Western Pacific, had argued that 99 percent of
all abortions on Guam were not necessary but were for the
convenience of the mother.
   In his ruling, Munson said sections of the law are vague and
that the provision against soliciting an abortion violates the
right to free speech.
   Arriola said the decision ``sends a very clear signal to
Governor Ada and the Guam Legislature and other legislatures around
the country.''
   ``This decision means that Roe vs. Wade is still the law of the
land,'' said Lou Leon Guerrero, president of People for Choice.
   Dawn C. Leon Guerrero, chairwoman of the Guam Pro-Life
Coalition, said she expected the ruling, ``because the judge has to
follow legal precedent.''
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''

   A federal judge on Monday extended a
restraining order against enforcement of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion law.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson had issued a temporary
restraining order Friday, a few hours after a group of Guam
residents and medical groups filed a class-action suit. On Monday,
he extended the order until May 8, when a trial on the suit is
scheduled to begin.
   ``We're very happy,'' said Anita Arriola, the plaintiffs'
attorney.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   The law in this Pacific territory is seen by abortion opponents
as a potential vehicle to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The Guam law provides for a referendum in the Nov. 6 general
election for Guam voters to decide whether to retain or reject the
abortion ban.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project defied the law last Tuesday when she
publicly encouraged women seeking abortions to have them done in
Hawaii. She was charged in the territorial Supreme Court with
solicitation to commit abortion, a misdemeanor.
   Among those named in the suit is Gov. Joseph Ada, who signed the
measure into law March 19.
   The plaintiffs include ``Maria Doe,'' a Guam woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion; the Guam Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an
Episcopal priest and three Guam doctors.

   The Coast Guard today called off a search for
10 crew members of a South Korean fishing boat missing for three
days since Typhoon Russ swept the area, officials said.
   A military transport ship located the partially submerged hull
of the 68-foot Marguarita I 35 miles off the southern tip of Guam
on Sunday, but there was no sign of the crew, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Assateague and a C130 aircraft searched a
19,000-square-mile area but didn't locate any crew members, said
Lt. Bob Ritchie of the Coast Guard Rescue Center on this U.S.
island territory in the Western Pacific. He said the search was
called off today.
   The Marguarita I sailed from Agana on Thursday, even though it
was well known the typhoon was bearing down on the island, said
Coast Guard Lt. Jeffrey Lee, duty officer for the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   The fishing vessel radioed its agent here late Thursday that it
was disabled with a clutch problem, Lee said.
   Communication with the boat was lost Friday when electrical
power went out on Guam as Typhoon Russ battered the island with
wind up to 150 mph.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said the storm
damged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes and injured 88 people. No
deaths were reported.
   Guam Power Authority officials said they expected to have
electrical power restored to 60 percent of the island today. Water
service remained disrupted in many areas because pumps were without
electrical power.
   Gov. Joseph Ada has asked President Bush to declare the island a
disaster area.

Candidates</HEAD>

   The fight to keep abortion legal on Guam is
being overshadowed in Saturday's primary elections by the
possibility that the U.S. territory may have its first woman and
non-native governor.
   Gov. Joseph Ada is unopposed on the Republican ballot as he
seeks a second term.
   Democrats face a choice between Sen. Madeleine Z. Bordallo, a
native of Minnesota and widow of Guam's former governor, or former
Lt. Gov. Rudy Sablan. The winner will face Ada on Nov. 6.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral legislature unanimously approved a
bill virtually banning abortions March 8 after Archbishop Anthony
Apuron threatened in a television interview to excommunicate any
Roman Catholic senator who voted against it.
   Ada signed the bill into law, saying: ``In my heart, I believe
that a fetus is a human being.''
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson struck down the law
as unconstitutional. Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Ada has not indicated whether he will seek an appeal.
   Mrs. Bordallo has said she also opposes abortion.
   Ada said he's running on his record of the past four years. He
said he is confident he and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Frank Blas,
will win re-election.
   On Jan. 31, Mrs. Bordallo's husband, Ricardo, chained himself to
a statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and shot himself in the
head. That occurred less than four hours before he was to fly to
Los Angeles to begin serving a four-year prison term for witness
tampering and obstruction.
   Ada defeated Bordallo in the 1986 election after Bordallo had
been indicted on the federal charges.
   Mrs. Bordallo wants to be Guam's first woman governor and the
first governor who is non-Chamorro, the name for native Guamanians.
   ``Women are moving ahead today. They are leading countries.
Right next door, we have a housewife leading 60 million people,''
said Mrs. Bordallo, referring to Philippine President Corazon
Aquino.
   Some 130,000 people life on Guam, an island about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.
   Mrs. Bordallo, 57, came to Guam in 1948 when her father accepted
a position as principal of George Washington High School here.
   Sablan, 58, served as Gov. Bordallo's lieutenant governor from
1974 to 1978, unsuccessfully challenged Bordallo in the Democratic
primaries in 1978 and 1982.
   Sablan, who also opposes abortion, said one of his priorities as
governor would be to set up a territorial tax structure that is not
tied to the federal tax system.
   The archbishop issued a pastoral letter published in newspapers
this week calling for voters to vote down pro-choice candidates.
   ``Like a modern day Pontius Pilate, a legislator or official may
attempt to wash his or her hands of abortion,'' Apuron said.
``However, the legislator cannot wash away the blood of the
innocents he or she has consciously declined to protect. Nor can
the voter sit idly by in apathy.''

   The governments of the Pacific islands of Guam and Saipan filed separate damage suits against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. alleging fraud and breach of contract in the New York bond firm's underwriting of huge bond issues there. 

   The suits, among a growing number of civil complaints against the Wall Street concern, seek $350 million in punitive damages and ask for a return of about $20 million in underwriting fees collected by Matthews &amp; Wright. 

   Filed in district courts of the U.S. territories, the suits also seek additional damages for "injuries suffered" to both islands' economies, said Donald C. Williams, an attorney representing the islands. 
The suits also name George Benoit, Matthews &amp; Wright's president and chairman; Arthur Abba Goldberg, its executive vice president; Frederick Mann, a Toronto businessman who served as an "authorized representative" in the bond issues; and a score of lawyers and consultants who helped package the bond issues. 

   Gerald A. Feffer, a Washington-based lawyer representing Matthews &amp; Wright, said, "We haven't seen the complaint" and therefore couldn't comment on the issue. 
In Toronto, Mr. Mann didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the suits. 

   As previously reported, both the Guam issue, for $300 million to finance low-income housing, and the Saipan issue, which was to fund $80 million in housing projects, are among more than 20 Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues under federal investigation. 
Many of the issues, all completed in 1985 and 1986 and representing about $3 billion in investments, are suspected of having been sham transactions designed largely to reap huge fees for the underwriter, federal officials close to the investigation have said. 

   In some cases, the underwriter is suspected of creating phony sales to beat a federal tax exemption deadline, and in others of coaxing municipalities into floating projects so huge and unrealistic that they were never viable. 
Investigators close to the case say that in some instances Matthews &amp; Wright is suspected of doing both. 
A number of grand juries investigating the bond issues, including one on Guam, also are investigating suspicions that Matthews &amp; Wright in some cases made payoffs to selected public officials to win their support for the bond issues. 
Attorneys hired by Matthews &amp; Wright to conduct an internal company investigation have said they found no evidence of bribery. 

   The federal probe, as reported, extends beyond Matthews &amp; Wright to perhaps a half-dozen other underwriters and involves another 80 municipal issues representing an additional $9 billion. 
All of the issues are so-called arbitrage or escrow bonds, a controversial type of financing that since has been greatly restricted by Congress. 
Until projects could get off the ground, proceeds from such low-interest bonds could be invested in higher-interest instruments that would provide income to issuers, fees to underwriters and returns to investors -- whether projects got built or not. 
In some cases, the proceeds in escrow were invested in a way that would protect the bond investors should the projects be scrapped. 

   Congress, in 1985, decided to severely curb arbitrage, arguing it gave issuers little incentive to complete projects and led to abuses. 
The congressional action set off a stampede of last-minute arbitrage bond filings in December 1985 and August 1986 in advance of two deadlines. 

   On both Guam and Saipan, no projects have yet been built under the bond issues, something common to many of the Matthews &amp; Wright issues. 
The bonds were structured so that the proceeds in escrow were kept from developers, thus preventing the financing for the projects to get under way. 
As a result, local contractors with limited skills and few resources were left to raise huge amounts of money in the interim, a task most have found impossible, according to investigators who have looked at many of the Matthews &amp; Wright issues. 

   In their lawsuits, Guam and Saipan allege that Matthews &amp; Wright, and its various consultants, breached promises and commitments to help obtain such financing, or misled local contractors about the availability or ease of obtaining financial backing for bond projects. 
The islands fear that the bond-issue problems might shut them out of the municipal credit markets in the future. 

   In a separate issue, the Guam suit also seeks to overturn an agreement between Matthews &amp; Wright and a Guam economic development agency that essentially limits the liability of the underwriter to $1.5 million in its preparation of the bond issue, shifting the liability to the government. 
The suit charges that the agreement represents an unauthorized "modification" to the original legislation authorizing the Guam bonds. 

   Guam is a U.S. trust territory of about 100,000 residents about 7,500 miles southwest of San Francisco; Saipan, a neighboring island, has about 20,000 residents and is the capital of a multi-island chain known as the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.

   A senior Internal Revenue Service official refused to say if the agency is likely to issue more letters, such as those sent to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, specifying that certain municipal bonds sold as tax-exempt securities are not tax-exempt. 
But he said the IRS is "not unaware" of a number of additional problem municipal issues. 

   "We just can't discuss anything we've got in-house," the official said, explaining that the IRS is barred by law from discussing taxpayer matters, including municipal bond deals suspected or deemed to have failed the tests for tax exemption. 

   At the same time, he said the IRS is "not unaware of a number of other bond issues" believed to have tax problems. 

   Former Treasury tax attorney Joseph Krolikowski, now in private law practice in Pittsburgh, said the IRS letters to Guam and the Northern Marianas "may open up a new era of the service quasi-publicly declaring bonds taxable." 
The IRS action is "a healthy development," he said. 
As previously reported, IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs recently told the governors of the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands that interest on $300 million of Guam bonds sold in October 1985 and on $80 million of Northern Marianas bonds sold in December 1984 "is not tax exempt." 
The agency concluded the bonds were arbitrage bonds. 
Both bond issues were underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., which said it believed the bonds were validly issued and are tax-exempt. 

   Mr. Gibbs said in his letters that the bond issuing agencies are entitled to a conference where additional facts or legal arguments could be presented regarding the tax status of the bonds. 
He further stated: "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through use of a closing agreement. 
Generally, under such agreements the service foregoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholders but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Some lawyers involved in the matter, noting the IRS letters set no deadlines for talks or for any closing agreement, speculated that the IRS could let things stand as they are indefinitely, without actually taxing bondholders. 
However, there are clear indications the IRS doesn't plan to let the matter remain pending indefinitely. 

   Some market participants following the slowly unfolding arbitrage bond saga said they expect a number of other "not-tax-exempt" letters to come from the IRS. 
They cited as leading candidates for such treatment the so-called South Tucson bonds, three bond issues totaling $368 million from three Arizona communities. 
Several market people said privately there are billions of dollars of questionable bonds sold earlier in the 1980s that could warrant "not tax-exempt" treatment by the IRS on the same grounds cited in the Guam and Northern Marianas Islands letters.

   Officials of U.S. territories told a
congressional panel Thursday that they have increasing drug
problems, and need the additional federal aid included in pending
legislation.
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Don de Lugo, D-Virgin Islands,
would provide training, equipment and money for American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Palau.
   De Lugo, who presided at the hearing as chairman of the House
Interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs, said he
expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive
drug bill this year.
   The legislation would provide $11.5 million in assistance in the
first year, and $5.5 million annually in subsequent years.
   Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly of the Virgin Islands said his
territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from
South America to the U.S. mainland.
   But the governor and Iver Stridiron, president of the Virgin
Islands legislature, said significant amounts of the drugs remain
in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes.
   ``It really has our community under siege,'' Stridiron said. But
he added that with additional resources, the island territory could
become a model of combatting the drug problem in U.S. territories.
   Farrelly said his major problem is resources, commenting that
the assignment of a single Drug Enforcement Administration agent in
the islands indicates either ``non-recognition of a serious
problem'' or lack of interest in solving it.
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada of Guam said his territory is experiencing a
resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following
the Vietnam War.
   ``In 1985, there was not one single case of heroin possession in
the territory of Guam,'' he testified. ``In 1986, 12 heroin arrests
were made by our police department.
   ``In 1987, there were 108 cases of heroin possession, with 56
still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation. By any
definition, this is an alarming rise,'' Ada said.
   The governor said 91 percent pure heroin from Southeast Asia has
been entering Guam through Palau. But after law enforcement
officers discovered the route, the drugs began coming to Guam via
the Northern Marianas, he said.
   Asked by de Lugo if he could put a cost on Guam's drug problem,
Ada said the law enforcement price tag could be $2 million to $3
million, but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma
and shattered lives _ not dollars.
   Responding to a question by Rep. Fofo I.F. Sunia, D-American
Samoa, Ada said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing
drugs with ``no questions asked.''
   A written statement submitted by American Samoa Gov. A.P. Lutali
said the ``most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse
problem'' in his territory is marijuana, followed by cocaine.
   Referring to the marijuana problem, Lutali's statement said,
``What 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small
number of individuals importing the drug through the U.S. mail has
now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families
producing in excess of seven tons per year.''

   A New York executive accused of pumping money
into the campaign of a former governor of Guam in exchange for a
political favor pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of mail fraud.
   Arthur Abba Goldberg entered the plea before U.S. District Judge
Jesse Curtis, said Guam's U.S. Attorney, Bill O'Connor. In exchange
for his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wire
and mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statutes
were dismissed.
   ``In dismissing the counts, the Guam issues were dissolved,''
O'Connor said. ``Other issues are on the table if another
jurisdiction sees fit to follow through.''
   Twelve of the counts were related directly to Guam, a U.S.
territory since August, 1950, said O'Connor. The balance of the
counts related to fraud involving use of the Commercial Bank of
Americas in transactions that did not involve Guam, O'Connor said.
   Although Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, only pleaded to three of the
dozen counts, O'Connor was satisfied with the outcome.
   ``Mr. Goldberg's plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than
if he went to trial,'' O'Connor said. ``We, of course, will
recommend jail time and a heavy fine.''
   Goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a $750,000 fine
and restitution payments, O'Connor said in a telephone interview
from his Santa Ana office. Sentencing was scheduled in Curtis' court
Sept. 11.
   One of Goldberg's attorneys, Howard L. Weitzman, said he had no
immediate comment. A receptionist who answered a call made after
business hours to another defense attorney, Bruce Hochman, said
Hochman had gone for the day.
   The three mail fraud counts concerned $57,500 bilked from the
Guam Program Development Fund and a letter assuring fund authorities
that transactions were above board, while fraud was taking place.
   Goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bank
entrusted with fund money. ``The bank paid the money Goldberg
exerted for his purposes and ... he attempted to cover up later with
false papers in the files,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor said $25,000 was ``used to buy campaign paraphernalia _
parasols, hats, shirts, junk like that'' for Guam Gov. Ricardo J.
Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election bid.
   The funds were funneled to Bordallo after he was promised the
money in exchange for his support on a bond issue, $300 million of
which was sold by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   The bond was approved by the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp;
Wright deny any wrongdoing.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February, 1986, of accepting bribes
from Goldberg but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
   The case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwide
involving Matthews &amp; Wright under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

   Arthur Abba Goldberg, executive vice president of Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., a New York bond underwriting firm, pleaded innocent to charges he orchestrated a bogus $300 million bond issue on Guam. 

   U.S. District Judge Cristobal Duenas allowed Mr. Goldberg to be freed on a $1 million unsecured bond. 
He is represented by Stanley S. Arkin. 

   Mr. Goldberg and Frederick L. Mann, a Canadian citizen and former consultant to Matthews &amp; Wright, were indicted Dec. 10 on 52 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and mail fruad, and violation of interstate anti-racketeering statutes in a scheme to amass more than $2.5 billion in fraudulent bond issues in Guam, Palau, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and cities across the U.S. 

   Mr. Mann, who also was scheduled for arraignment yesterday, did not appear. 
Prosecutors said they did not know his whereabouts. 

   Edward K. Strauss, legal counsel to Matthews &amp; Wright on the Guam bond, pleaded guilty last week to a charge of withholding knowledge of Messrs. 
Goldberg's and Mann's actions. 
He agreed to disclose knowledge of their alleged schemes in exchange for a recommendation of no prison term.

FIRST CHARGES FILED TO TEST STRICT GUAM ABORTION LAW

<P>
Guam's attorney general, seeking a constitutional test of the U.S. territory's 
day-old anti-abortion law, on Tuesday filed a complaint against a New York 
woman who had disseminated information here about terminating pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on Monday, is the most restrictive 
abortion legislation in the United States and has riveted national attention on 
this tiny South Pacific island. 
</P>
<P>
The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion even in cases of rape, incest 
and fetal abnormality. An abortion is allowed only if two independent doctors 
determine a pregnancy would endanger the life of a mother or gravely impair her 
health. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes it a misdemeanor to have an abortion or "knowingly solicit" 
pregnant women to have one. 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint filed in Superior Court here, Atty. Gen. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Anderson said that Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Rights 
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, violated the law when she 
encouraged pregnant women seeking abortions to leave Guam for Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Anderson had previously advised both the governor and the Guam 
Legislature that the abortion law was unconstitutional and said Tuesday that 
her action was designed to force a constitutional test. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to bring a criminal charge under the new law will provide the 
basis for the courts to decide the question as quickly as possible. I believe 
this will be in the best interests of the government and of all persons 
affected by the new law," Barrett-Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Guam have an opportunity to repeal the legislation in a referendum 
scheduled in November. The law was passed by the territorial Legislature after 
the archbishop of Guam had threatened to excommunicate those who opposed the 
measure, although most of the legislators said they were unaware of the threat. 
More than 90% of the population on the island is Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the legislation on Monday, Gov. Ada had insisted the law was a local 
issue. "I am not taking this action today to affect anyone's life in the 50 
states. I believe that this is a community issue and a community concern, first 
and foremost." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion foes and abortion rights supporters have seized upon the law as a 
possible test of the Supreme Court's willingness to temper or undo its historic 
Roe vs. Wade decision, which guaranteed women a right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho and Maryland are currently studying abortion legislation, but the Guam 
law caught activists by surprise. Benshoof arrived in Guam over the weekend 
proclaiming that the new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade and likened 
the bill to a "Pearl Harbor for women." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday she acknowledged that she was breaking the law in providing the 
name, address and phone number of a Honolulu group that could help women get an 
abortion. The attorney general's complaint was filed Tuesday afternoon. 
Benshoof's arraignment was set for today.

   Gov. Joseph Ada said a fetus is a human being
in signing a bill creating the most restrictive U.S. abortion
statute, but abortion rights advocates already are challenging the
measure.
   Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,
immediately violated the law by telling women in a speech where to
go to have an abortion, and the territory's attorney general _ who
personally opposes the measure _ pressed charges.
   Territorial Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson says
prosecuting the case will be ``a heavy burden,'' but a
responsibility of her job.
   Benshoof made a court appearance Tuesday, Guam time, but
Superior Court Judge Ramon V. Diaz said he could not hear the case
because he did not feel he could render a fair and impartial
decision.
   Benshoof is scheduled to be arraigned today.
   The law, which passed despite a ruling by Barrett-Anderson that
it is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person
to perform or help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or
soliciting someone to have an abortion are misdemeanors.
   The law also sets a referendum during the Nov. 6 general
election for residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500
miles east of the Philippines to decide whether to keep the law.
   ``In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being,'' Ada,
the Republican governor, said in signing the bill, which prohibits
abortion except when the mother's health or life are endangered.
   Benshoof said she immediately violated a provision of the law by
advising women in a speech at the Guam Press Club later in the day
to go to Hawaii to have legal abortions.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' Benshoof
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the Honolulu Yellow Pages.''
   Barrett-Anderson filed a misdemeanor complaint charging Benshoof
with violating the ban on soliciting someone to have an abortion.
Benshoof faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   ``It's a matter of public record that I advised the Guam
Legislature ... that in my opinion the bill was unconstitutional by
operation of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade,''
Barrett-Anderson said later in a statement.
   ``My advisory role has now shifted to one of enforcement. This
is a heavy burden, but ... I will enforce this statute to the
extent that the law allows.''
   Benshoof, who went to Guam to try to persuade Ada not to sign
the bill, was not arrested but appeared in court voluntarily.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the
bill March 8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an
interview with a television reporter to excommunicate any Roman
Catholic senator who voted against it. All but one of the senators
is Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators said they
were unaware of the threat.
   Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life
Committee.
   ``This is great news,'' group spokeswoman Nancy Myers said in a
telephone interview from her Washington office. ``The people of
Guam are largely pro-life as reflected by the unanimous vote in the
Legislature, and they have made a strong statement.''

   Four delegates were chosen today to represent
this U.S. territory at the Republican National Convention and all
say they support Vice President George Bush for president.
   Those selected at the territory's Republican convention included
territorial Gov. Joseph F. Ada, who said of Bush: ``He knows where
Guam is. His heart is in Guam. He told me that one of these days
the people of Guam are going to vote for president.''
   Although residents of Guam are American citizens, they are not
allowed to cast ballots in presidential elections.
   Bush said of the Guam results: ``This victory is a tribute to
the hard work and dedication of our organization there.''
   About 200 party members who attended the GOP gathering approved
a number of resolutions that will be given to all GOP presidential
candidates.
   One of the resolutions supports the drive to give territorial
residents the right to vote in presidential elections, while
another presses for Guam to become a commonwealth of the United
States.

<HL> Attorney Agrees To Cooperate In Guam Inquiry --- Strauss Enters Guilty Plea In Matthews &amp; Wright Municipal Bond Scandal </HL>

   A key player in the Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. municipal bond scandal agreed to cooperate as a prosecution witness in a Guam federal grand jury investigation of a top Matthews &amp; Wright executive and a former company consultant. 

   The agreement was disclosed in documents filed in federal court on Guam by Edward K. Strauss, a Pittsburgh attorney, who provided tax opinions on numerous Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues, and William O'Connor, Guam's U.S. attorney. 
Mr. Strauss, according to the documents, pleaded guilty to concealing knowledge of "cognizable felonies" allegedly committed by Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's executive vice president, and Frederick Mann, a Canadian who served as a Matthews &amp; Wright consultant. 

   In exchange for Mr. Strauss's plea and cooperation, federal authorities pledged not to seek additional criminal charges against him unless he provides "deliberately false or misleading" testimony, Mr. O'Connor, the federal attorney, said. 
Mr. Strauss, a partner in the firm of Berkman Ruslander Pohl Lieber &amp; Engel, was said to be traveling and couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Strauss's surprising guilty plea would appear to strengthen the government's case against Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann, who were charged last month by a Guam federal grand jury in a 52-count indictment alleging fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
The indictments stem largely from their handling of a $300 million housing bond issue on Guam; an $80 million housing issue on the neighboring island of Saipan; and a $400 million bond issue for the island of Palau. 

   Those issues are among some 20 Matthews &amp; Wright bond offerings, representing about $3 billion, that are being investigated by several federal jurisdictions. 
Federal prosecutors suspect that many were bloated, sham transactions rushed to market by Matthews &amp; Wright to beat a federal tax deadline and generate huge underwriting fees. 

   In court documents filed as part of his plea agreement, Mr. Strauss stated that he "knew or had reason to suspect" that 13 separate bond issues allegedly bought by Matthews &amp; Wright were fraudulent transactions "conducted by Goldberg and Mann" using worthless checks processed through an unlicensed Saipan bank controlled by Mr. Mann. 

   Those issues -- representing about $2.1 billion -- include a $125.3 million East St. Louis, Ill., resource recovery bond; a $223.7 million East St. Louis port development bond; a $200 million Washington County, Pa., revenue bond; a $335 million City of Chester, Pa., resource recovery bond; a $500 million East Chicago Heights, Ill., resource recovery bond; and the $400 million Palau bond. 

   Mr. Strauss also stated that he knew or suspected that Mr. Goldberg had committed federal mail fraud in January 1986 by submitting $57,500 of "false or fraudulent" invoices to a Guam government agency for consulting services never performed. 

   The charge to which Mr. Strauss pleaded guilty is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and three years in jail. 

   Mr. Goldberg, who has taken a voluntary leave of absence from Matthews &amp; Wright, will voluntarily appear on Guam next week where he is expected to plead not guilty to the 52-count indictment. 
His attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said Mr. Goldberg, despite Mr. Strauss's agreement with federal prosecutors, "steadfastly maintains his innocence." 

   Authorities have sworn out an arrest warrant for Mr. Mann, who has denied the charges against him. 

   An attorney with Williams &amp; Connolly, the law firm representing Matthews &amp; Wright, said Matthews &amp; Wright continues to insist it engaged in no wrongdoing. 
"It's still the company's position they relied on Strauss's counsel," he said.

Indicted Over $300 Million Bond Issue

   A federal grand jury on Guam returned a 52-count indictment against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.'s executive vice president Arthur Abba Goldberg and company consultant Frederick L. Mann, alleging bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice. 

   Most of the charges stem from the roles of Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann in the company's handling of a $300 million Guam housing bond issue in 1985, William O'Connor, Guam's U.S. attorney, said. 
Some of the counts also relate to their handling of an $80 million housing issue for Guam's neighboring island, Saipan, and a $400 million issue for the Pacific island of Palau, Mr. O'Connor added. 

   The indictments are the first to come from a wide-ranging federal criminal investigation -- believed to include at least five other grand juries in the mainland U.S. -- of the tiny Wall Street bond house. 
The Guam bond issue is among more than 20 Matthews &amp; Wright municipal issues, representing about $3 billion, that federal authorities believe may have been sham transactions put together by Matthews &amp; Wright to beat a federal tax deadline. 

   Few, if any, projects have been built from the issues but they reaped enormous profits for the company and its principals while duping and defrauding some of the poorest municipalities in America, officials close to these investigations believe. 

   Mr. Goldberg will be ordered to post a $1 million recognizance bond and report to the island on Jan. 15 for a hearing in U.S. District Court, Mr. O'Connor said. 
The court also has issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Mann, president of J.D. Moore &amp; Co., a Toronto investment concern, and decreed that he be held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail. 
Mr. Mann is a felon convicted by Canadian courts in 1984 of swindling a dying widow out of $65,000, Toronto court records show. 

   Neither Mr. Goldberg nor Mr. Mann could be reached immediately for comment. 

   In the indictments, which don't name Matthews &amp; Wright itself, Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann are accused of channeling $70,000 in bribes -- part of $350,000 in bribery offers -- to former Guam Gov. Ricardo Bordallo for use in his 1986 election campaign in exchange for Mr. Bordallo's approval of the Guam issue. 

   The indictments also charge that a substantial portion of the funds paid to Mr. Bordallo were illicitly diverted from a Guam government fund that had been set up by the island's legislature to support local developers' efforts to construct housing to be financed by the $300 million housing issue. 

   The indictments also allege that Mr. Goldberg supervised the billing of $27,500 to the fund in the name of a non-existent company and in another case obtained a $30,000 fund payment "for work which was not done." 

   Mr. Bordallo earlier this year was acquitted of bribery charges related to the Matthews &amp; Wright payoffs but was convicted on unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on Guam. 
John Gilliam, a former aide to Mr. Bordallo, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court last summer to a wire-fraud charge in connection with the $70,000 bribery payment, records in Guam U.S. District Court show. 

   The indictment also alleges an "overarching scheme" by Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann to obtain "more than $11 million" in fees for the company and themselves by a "complex wire and mail fraud scheme involving a number of small, financially unsophisticated Pacific and stateside local jurisdictions." 
The indictment contends that the two men, by using an "unlicensed" bank on Saipan controlled by Mr. Mann, "bogus checks and bank accounts and world-wide wire transactions" promoted a "nationwide fraud." 

   In one example, the indictment charges that Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann "willfully and knowingly" misrepresented the need for a $400 million bond issue for "undefined, speculative projects" on the tiny Pacific island of Palau, which has 10,000 residents. 

   The documents allege that through a "series of bogus paper transactions" Mr. Goldberg, with the help of certain other Matthews &amp; Wright officials, duped the island's government into believing that its bond issue had been sold, when in fact it hadn't. 

   The indictment charges that certain Matthews &amp; Wright officials went to the extent of contracting with Texas and Pennsylvania computer concerns to print "bogus statements" aimed at convincing Palau officials that the bond transactions were legitimate and had taken place. 

   Also named, but not charged, in the indictment as "relevant" to the Matthews &amp; Wright scheme were: Edward K. Strauss, a Pennsylvania attorney for the company; George W. Benoit, a Matthews &amp; Wright founder and its chief executive officer; Roger J. Burns, the company's chief financial officer; Joseph Craven, identified as a Matthews &amp; Wright "junior executive"; Joel Schwarz, manager of New American Federal Credit Union of Jersey City, New Jersey; John C. Zaccaro, identified only as a Matthews &amp; Wright employee; and Phillip J. Kieffer, a Matthews &amp; Wright consultant. 
None of those listed could be reached immediately for comment.

<HEAD>Guam Governor Signs Most Restricted Abortion Law in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada today signed into law a
bill containing the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, and opponents pledged to fight to measure all the
way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``The question for me really boils down to one simple point,''
Ada said. ``In my heart, I believe a fetus is a human being.''
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. The law makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Although the bill is now law, it contains a clause calling for a
referendum on abortion during the Nov. 6 general election, allowing
voters to decide whether they want to retain the law.
   Ada signed the bill before a room packed with dozens of abortion
rights supporters and opponents.
   ``My personal views on the subject of abortion have been stated
many times and should be, by now, fairly well known,'' Ada said.
``I do not agree with the practice of abortion, except in the case
of rape, incest and where the life of the mother may be
threatened.''
   ``It was outrageous that the bill was signed,'' said Janet
Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project, based in New York.
   Benshoof arrived Sunday in this U.S. territory in the western
Pacific Ocean, hoping to meet with Ada to discuss the implications
of the bill. The meeting never took place.
   ``I was devastated he was making a personal opinion,'' Benshoof
said. ``We all have a conscience. I believe he should be making the
decision for the people of Guam.''
   Benshoof said she will remain on Guam for ``as long as it
takes'' and said she has no immediate plans to return to New York.
   The unicameral Guam Legislature unanimously approved the bill
March 8 despite an opinion from Attorney General Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson that it is unconstitutional.
   It was amended before approval to provide the public referendum
on the abortion issue.
   The vote came after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened to
excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against the
measure. All but one of the 21 senators are Catholic, as is Ada.
However, not all senators were aware of Apuron's threat before the
vote.
   Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom
Project, had said the Guam law, if approved, would give the U.S.
Supreme Court the opportunity to decide the core issue of the right
to abortion.
   In a letter sent to Ada before the signing, Benshoof said the
case would be ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court.

   Abortion on demand would be illegal in this
U.S. territory if Gov. Joseph Ada fails to veto a bill passed
unanimously by the 21-member Legislature.
   Supporters of legalized abortion have started a campaign to
pressure Ada to cast a veto, while abortion opponents applauded the
legislation.
   ``Clearly the people of Guam don't want abortion on demand and
have made a clear statement on this,'' said Nancy Myers, the
National Right to Life Committee's director of communications in
Washington.
   Ada can veto the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, or sign it into law. If he does neither by midnight
Tuesday, it will become law automatically.
   Under the bill, abortion would be allowed only if a pregnancy
endangers a woman's health. Two independent doctors would have to
give their approval and their decision would have to be reviewed by
a committee appointed by the Guam Medical Licensure Board.
   The bill was amended before approval to provide for a referendum
on the issue in November.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, was to arrive here Sunday to
lobby against the bill.
   ``Our position is that the bill is patently unconstitutional,''
Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said in New York.
``If the bill becomes law, we expect that it would be struck down
in the lower courts.''
   The ACLU is concerned that the measure could threaten the
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which legalized abortion.
   ``Guam seems far away and only a territory, but passage of this
law could take Roe versus Wade away from women all over the
nation.''
   The Legislature approved the bill March 8 after Archbishop
Anthony Apuron threatened to excommunicate any of its 20 Roman
Catholic lawmakers who might vote against it. However, not all of
the legislators were aware of the threat before the vote was taken.
   Myers said her group does not plan to send anyone to Guam to
lobby Ada to sign the bill.
   ``The people of Guam have spoken and we are not going to try to
foist anything on them like the ACLU is doing,'' she said.
   Ada, who is also Roman Catholic, has said the bill will have to
be thoroughly studied by legal experts before he makes a decision.
His deputy chief of staff, Mark Forbes, said the bill is ``a bit
more severe than the governor's personal view.''

   Arthur Abba Goldberg has taken a "voluntary leave of absence" from his position as executive vice president of Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. after his indictment by a Guam federal grand jury on charges of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice, the company said. 

   The Wall Street bond concern also said Mr. Goldberg resigned as a director of the firm and its units and plans to "devote full time and effort to the defense of his case." 

   Mr. Goldberg, known on Wall Street as "Abba Dabba Do" for his aggressive deal-making, couldn't be reached for comment. 
But his attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, called the 52-count indictment against the 46-year-old Mr. Goldberg "factually and legally baseless." 
Mr. Arkin said Mr. Goldberg will plead not guilty to the charges at an arraignment on Guam during the week of Jan. 18. 

   Mr. Arkin also said the bribery charges against Mr. Goldberg, related to an alleged $70,000 campaign payoff to Guam's former Gov. Ricardo Bordallo in 1986, are "ludicrous" because Mr. Bordallo already has been tried and acquitted of related charges. 
Mr. Bordallo earlier this year was tried and acquitted of bribery charges related to payoffs but was convicted on unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on Guam. 

   The indictments by the Guam grand jury Wednesday included allegations that Mr. Goldberg and Frederick L. Mann, a former Matthews &amp; Wright consultant, masterminded an effort to win Mr. Bordallo's support for a $300 million Guam housing bond, which netted Matthews &amp; Wright huge fees but has yet to produce any houses. 
The indictments charge that the men undertook an intricate scheme in which they secretly funneled money -- some of it from a Guam government account -- into Mr. Bordallo's unsuccessful re-election campaign in exchange for the governor's backing of the bond issue. 

   Mr. Mann, president of J.D. Moore &amp; Co., a Toronto investment concern, called the charges against him a "manufactured situation" and accused Guam U.S. Attorney William O'Connor of "self-aggrandizement" in his handling of the investigation. 
Mr. Mann said that proof of that "self-aggrandizement" was the omission of Matthews &amp; Wright itself and its chief executive officer, George Benoit, in any indictments even though both had "full knowledge" of the Guam and other Pacific island bond issues under investigation. 
Mr. O'Connor couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Mann declined to say whether he would voluntarily surrender to U.S. authorities, and he wouldn't discuss other aspects of the case. 
A federal judge on Guam has ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to arrest Mr. Mann, a Canadian citizen, "wherever they find him" and hold him under $1 million bail. 

   Mr. Mann was convicted in 1984 of swindling a dying widow and longtime family friend of $65,000, Toronto court records show. 
Though Mr. Mann acknowledges the conviction, he said that it had been misrepresented by the press and he vowed to take legal action against those who have "misquoted or given a slanted version of the events." 
For that conviction, he was sentenced to three years in prison, according to Toronto court records. 

   Matthews &amp; Wright declined to comment on the indictment of Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann. 
The company, in a prepared statement, said it "fully cooperated" in the Guam grand jury investigation, adding that "we think it is significant to note that neither the company" nor employees except Mr. Goldberg and the company's former consultant, Mr. Mann, were charged in the indictments. 
Matthews &amp; Wright added that the indictments were "limited to alleged unauthorized actions" of Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann. 

   "We continue to believe that the company has conducted business in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and that all underwritings were properly handled," the statement said. 

   The Guam grand jury, however, named several Matthews &amp; Wright officials, including Mr. Benoit and Roger Burns, its chief financial officer, as "relevant" to a far-flung Matthews &amp; Wright scheme that the grand jury said essentially allowed the company to fake $2 billion in so-called arbitrage bond sales to beat a federal tax deadline that made such transactions illegal. 

   The indictments allege that through a shell Saipan bank controlled by Mr. Mann and through a New Jersey credit union controlled by Mr. Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright manufactured a series of "bogus transactions" that made it appear that certain bond issues had been sold when they hadn't. 
In at least one case, Messrs. 
Benoit and Burns signed "bogus checks" that were part of the ruse, the indictments state. 

   The indictments also state that Edward K. Strauss, a Pittsburgh attorney, "helped the defendants" in part of their bond scheme by issuing a favorable tax-opinion letter on a certain Matthews &amp; Wright bond transaction, despite knowledge that the IRS had expressed "serious concern" about the issue's tax-exempt status. 
Efforts to reach Matthews &amp; Wright officials for further comment were unsuccessful. 
Mr. Strauss, who wasn't indicted, was said by his office to be traveling and unavailable for comment. 

   As many as 20 Matthews &amp; Wright arbitrage bond issues, representing perhaps $3 billion, are under a federal criminal investigation. 
Under a form of arbitrage that now is largely outlawed by Congress, proceeds from low-yielding tax-exempt municipal issues could be invested at a profit in higher-paying instruments, such as Treasury bills, until the proceeds were needed for projects. 
The issues were popular because they allowed underwriters to collect fees and municipalities to reap arbitrage profits, regardless of whether projects were ever built.

<HEAD>Guam Abortion Law Rescinded; May Set Stage for Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge overturned the nation's most
restrictive abortion law on Thursday. Pro-choice activists said an
appeal of that ruling would threaten the Supreme Court's landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion, ``applied with
equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued the
law did not apply to Guam because of the island's status as an
unincorporated territory.
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the woman's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   ``The threat we live with is that the Supreme Court has
indicated a willingness to overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``If the governor appeals (Munson's ruling) he will endanger the
rights of all women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of
Roe vs. Wade. Our goal is to keep these cases out of the courts,''
Michelman said.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   Abortion opponents say they were not surprised by the judge's
decision, adding the next step probably will be an appeal that
would send the case to the Supreme Court.
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''
   ``Guam's strong law ... could not be upheld without overturning
Roe vs. Wade,'' said Rep. Woody Jenkins, D-La., lead author of an
anti-abortion bill approved by the Louisiana Legislature but vetoed
by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   ``Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge
would follow the Roe decision and rule against the Guam law, it
must be remembered that this is just the first stage in the
process,'' Jenkins said.
   ``What is important is that this decision be appealed all the
way to the Supreme Court so that the highest court in the land is
given the chance to stop the killing of unborn babies,'' he said in
Baton Rouge.
   Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it
violated free speech and due process clauses of the Constitution.
   ``The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn
Roe vs. Wade,'' Simon Heller, an attorney with the Reproductive
Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``But I doubt it will stop
legislatures from adopting similar laws. It's not like the Supreme
Court issued this ruling.''

   Arthur Abba Goldberg, executive vice president of Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc., was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $100,000 for his role in a scheme to defraud a trust fund as part of a $300 million Guam bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright. 

   Mr. Goldberg, who in July pleaded guilty in federal court here to three counts of using the mails to defraud the Guam trust fund of $57,500, also was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to make restitution of $300,000 to the South Pacific U.S. territory. 
However, Mr. Goldberg would be eligible for parole after six months in prison, and the amount of restitution could be reduced under the sentence handed down yesterday by Senior U.S. District Judge Jesse Curtis. 

   Known as an aggressive Wall Street dealmaker, Mr. Goldberg was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in Guam in late 1987 on 52 counts of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice in what authorities had charged was a nationwide bogus bond scheme totaling $2 billion. 

   The 46-year-old Mr. Goldberg, a former New Jersey deputy attorney general, has been on leave from Matthews &amp; Wright since the indictment. 
Still pending are the Securities and Exchange Commission's charges against him and others of fraud in connection with "sham closings" of more than $1 billion of municipal bonds in violation of tax rules in 1985 and 1986. 
Matthews &amp; Wright and two individuals settled with the SEC; Mr. Goldberg was fighting the charges. 

   K. William O'Connor, the U.S. attorney for Guam, had sought a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a $750,000 fine. 
But he said yesterday that the court had gone "into the matter with great care and the public interest has been served" by the sentence. 
An attorney for Mr. Goldberg declined to comment.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Allows Guam Women to Seek Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today issued a temporary
restraining order allowing women in this U.S. territory to seek
abortions despite a law banning the procedure.
   The order resulted from a lawsuit filed by Janet Benshoof,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom
Project, Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said from
New York. Pine provided The Associated Press a copy of U.S.
District Judge Alex R. Munson's order.
   Munson scheduled a hearing for Monday at which he will decide
whether to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
the law until the lawsuit is heard in court, according to Pine.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman
to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person to
solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Gov. Joseph Ada signed the measure into law Monday. It was
unanimously passed March 8 by the territory's Legislature.
   Benshoof was charged Tuesday with a misdemeanor charge of
solicitation to commit abortion after she tested the law by
advising women seeking abortions to travel to Honolulu.
   She pleaded innocent in Guam Superior Court and is free on her
own recognizance. Pine said if the judge grants the preliminary
injuction, the ACLU would have grounds to ask that charges against
Benshoof be dropped.
   Guam is an island in the western Pacific Ocean about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.

   Opponents of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion law are organizing in hopes of persuading voters in this
territory to overturn the measure in November.
   A court test of a section of the new law already was under way
Wednesday, less than 48 hours after Gov. Joseph Ada signed the
bill, which was unanimously passed March 8 by the Pacific Ocean
island's Legislature.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, was to be arraigned
Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit
abortion.
   During a speech Tuesday at the Guam Press Club, Benshoof urged
woman needing an abortion to travel to Honolulu for the procedure.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' Benshoof
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the Honolulu Yellow Pages.''
   Two investigators from the territorial attorney general's office
taped the speech, and Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson
filed the charge later in the day. Benshoof faces up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   The attorney general had advised the Legislature before the vote
that the measure is unconstitutional. After the governor signed it,
she said, ``it is not my duty to decide the statute's
constitutionality but to enforce it.''
   A pro-choice group, Guamanians for Self-Determination, set an
organizational meeting for Thursday and pledged to fight the law.
The meeting was scheduled by about 35 women who met following
Benshoof's speech Tuesday.
   The law sets a referendum for the 130,000 residents of this
island about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines to decide whether
to keep the law.
   The issue of giving advice about abortions also was involved in
a federal appeals court ruling in Boston on Tuesday.
   The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a federal
regulation that prohibits government-funded family planning clinics
from discussing abortion with clients is an unconstitutional
infringement on freedom of speech.
   The court said the speech at issue involves telling a woman
about an activity ``in which she has a constitutional right to
engage.''
   Elsewhere, Idaho's state Senate put off until Thursday a vote on
what could become the most restrictive abortion law of any state.
Supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass. Gov. Cecil Andrus
has said he is anti-abortion but has refused to say whether he will
sign or veto the measure.
   A filibuster in the Maryland Senate against an abortion-rights
bill continued for sixth day on Tuesday. The bill would allow
unrestricted abotions until a fetus is old enough to survive
outside the womb.
   In Laredo, Texas, the City Council on Monday passed a resolution
stating that life begins at conception. While a resolution is
merely an expression of the council's opinion, an anti-abortion
activist said he'll push for a city anti-abortion ordinance.
   Benshoof came to Guam on Sunday in hopes of dissuading Ada from
signing the bill. She was unable to arrange a meeting with the
governor.
   ``This is an issue that effects all women in the United States,
not just Guam,'' she said.
   Guam residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S.
elections. It has an appointed governor and elected legislature.

   Typhoon Percy battered the Pacific
island of Palau and then roared Sunday toward the Philippines,
where 30 people were killed in a tropical storm last week.
   One child was killed on Palau, a newspaper said.
   The Manila weather bureau reported at 5 a.m. Monday that Percy,
packing 93 mph winds, was centered about 465 miles east of the
Philippine island of Samar.
   Percy was moving west-northwest at about 19 mph toward the
islands of Catanduanes and southeastern Luzon island, which were
expected to feel the effects of the storm late Monday, the weather
bureau said.
   Storm signals were raised over southeastern Luzon and the
central Visayas island chain, which includes Samar.
   In Palau, a young boy died Saturday night when he was swept by
rain into mangrove trees near his home in the cluster of islands
that comprise Palau, the Pacific Daily News of Guam reported.
   The storm passed 90 miles north of Palau, which is 800 miles
south of Guam, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   Wind gusts of up to 103 mph blew off tin roofs of many buildings
and knocked radio and television stations off the air, the Pacific
Daily News said.
   Airline flights into the republic were canceled, the newspaper
said.
   Earlier Sunday, the typhoon's winds battered Yap Island in the
neighboring Federated States of Micronesia, collapsing about 30
houses and damaging banana and coconut plantations, police said.
There were no reports of injuries on Yap.
   On Friday, Typhoon Ofelia swept over the eastern coast of Luzon,
the main Philippine island, then struck Taiwan. Officials said at
least 30 people were killed in the Philippines and at least seven
in Taiwan.
   More than 84,000 people in the Philippines were forced to flee
their homes because of flooding and landslides touched off by
Ofelia, officials said. Officials were still assessing damage to
crops and infrastructure.
   About 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the Philippines
each year.

   A U.S. judge in Guam on Friday blocked the territory's new
abortion law, the nation's most restrictive, and a legislative
package that would let Maryland voters decide the abortion issue
lost a vote and appeared doomed.
   In Idaho, more than 50 junior high school students staged a
brief sit-in in the office of Gov. Cecil Andrus, protesting the
Legislature's passage of a law that would ban more than 90 percent
of the abortions performed in the state.
   They demanded that the governor veto the legislation, which was
approved Thursday and is the most restrictive abortion measure
passed by any state legislature.
   Pro-choice interests in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Rhode
Island and North Carolina have threatened to boycott Idaho potatoes
if Andrus fails to veto the bill.
   ``Women can fight back,'' said Anne Nicol Gaylor, administrator
of the Madison based-Women's Medical Fund Inc., based in Madison,
Wis. ``We do not have to beg and plead for our rights any more.''
   Either the Guam law or the Idaho law could provide the basis for
a direct challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions.
   The Maryland Senate early Friday approved and sent to the House
of Delegates a complicated compromise to end an eight-day
filibuster on the abortion issue.
   But the House Environmental Matters Committee voted 13 to 12
against the package Friday night.
   There had been a possibility that an attempt to revive the
proposal would be made on the House floor, but because of House
Democratic leadership opposition, the committee action most likely
ends the matter for the 1990 session.
   John S. Arnick, chairman of Environmental Matters, told that
panel before he cast the tie-breaking vote that the leadership's
recommendation was to defeat both bills ``for the sake of the
system.'' He said the compromise involved a ``convoluted system
that doesn't make sense in a lot of ways'' and warned that ``the
public would be cursed with confusion.''
   Under the compromise, an abortion rights bill permitting
unrestricted abortions during the early stages of pregnancy would
have become law. Voters would have been able to call a referendum
on the law in November through a petition drive.
   If voters then rejected it in the referendum, then a bill
sponsored by anti-abortion senators would have become law _ unless
it also was defeated by voters. That bill would have allowed
abortions in cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother's life
or if the pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on
the woman's health.
   The compromise required that both measures be passed by the
House and signed by the governor. If one of the measures was
rejected, the other one aldo would have died, but the committee
vote made all that moot.
   In Agana, Guam, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson issued a
temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the territory's
new law, a few hours after a group of Guam residents and medical
groups filed a class-action lawsuit. He scheduled a hearing for
Monday on whether to extend his order.
   The plaintiffs included ``Maria Doe,'' a Guam woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion, the Guam Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an
Episcopal priest and three doctors.
   Defendants include Gov. Joseph Ada, who signed the bill into law
Monday, and territorial Attorney General Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson, who advised the Legislature that the bill was
unconstitutional before it was approved.
   Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union's Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, said the lawsuit
cites violation of constitutional guarantees of right to privacy,
due process, free speech, equal protection, guarantees of religious
freedoms and freedom from slavery.
   Guam's law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a felony to perform abortion or
aid in the procedure, and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or
have an abortion, or for a person to solicit a woman to have an
abortion.
   The law provides for a referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot for Guam
voters to decide whether to retain or reject the law.
   Guam's law is more restrictive than the bill passed by the Idaho
Legislature.
   The Idaho bill would ban abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the
mother's life or physical health. It would ban more than 90 percent
of the 1,500 abortions performed in Idaho annually.
   ``Idaho was one of the first states to give women their rights,
and now they want to take them away from us,'' said 15-year-old
Michele May, one of those protesting at the governor's office in
Boise. ``We can't let them do that.''
   If Andrus signs the bill, the law would take effect July 1, and
abortion rights groups have promised a quick court challenge. The
governor has not said what he would do.
   In Washington, D.C., Guam's congressional delegate worked to
head off retaliation from colleagues resulting from the abortion
law.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., sent a letter to colleagues
Thursday, urging them to withdraw support for a bill to provide
commonwealth status for Guam.
   ``States and territories may have the right to pass laws that
deny women the right to choice, but no government has the right to
deny its citizens freedom of speech,'' Miller's letter said.

<HL> U.S. Investigating Bribery Allegations
Against Matthews &amp; Wright Bond Unit

   Federal authorities are now investigating allegations that Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.'s municipal bond subsidiary systematically made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payments to certain public officials to influence them to approve a number of questionable bond issues. 

   The authorities also are investigating the allegedly fraudulent inflating of Matthews &amp; Wright's stock because of its earnings from fees generated in the bond issues, which the company underwrote. 

   Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and various U.S. attorney's offices said they are probing complaints by businessmen in the various locations that the municipal bond unit bribed officials to help win approval of the bond issues, which already are being studied by federal regulators for their tax-exempt status. 

   The investigators are focusing on a $300 million issue for Guam; an $80 million issue for its neighboring island, Saipan; and two issues totaling $350 million for East St. Louis, Ill. 
Investigators said other issues underwritten by the subsidiary, known as Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., may also be involved. 

   In a class-action suit filed against Matthews &amp; Wright last month in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, investors alleged, among other things, that a former $20,000-a-year assistant solicitor for the city of Chester, Pa., had received a $350,000 fee as "special counsel" to the underwriter for a $335 million bond issue there. 
The suit charged that the former official was "instrumental" in getting Matthews &amp; Wright selected as the sole underwriter for the bond issue. 

   In some cases, the payment of bribes together with high-pressure tactics were the company's "modus operandi," said an FBI agent familiar with the case. 

   Separately, federal law enforcement officials are also seeking to determine whether Matthews &amp; Wright violated federal securities laws in connection with the company's initial public offering of stock in 1986. 
The focus of the inquiry is whether an avalanche of questionable tax-exempt bond sales, including the Guam, Saipan and East St. Louis issues, were part of a ploy to fatten earnings through fees, and thus pump up the value of Matthews &amp; Wright shares, at the time of the public offering in August 1986. 

   Officials of New York-based Matthews &amp; Wright didn't return repeated phone calls seeking comment. 

   Matthews &amp; Wright went public with 1.5 million shares at $11 a share, and its stock has traded as high as $13.58. 
However, the company's shares have sunk following reports of investigations that could lead to a challenge of the tax-exempt status of dozens of Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues. 
The company's shares closed yesterday at $3, down 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange trading. 

   Those issues are among as many as 100 municipal issues, involving as much as $12 billion, that appear to have been rushed to completion by Matthews &amp; Wright and other firms in advance of 1986 federal tax legislation greatly restricting the practice of "arbitraging" bonds. 
In such situations, the issuers of the bonds, while deciding how and when to use the proceeds for the intended public works projects, invest them at a rate higher than the low rate they paid to borrow the funds, thus earning a profit on the difference in interest rates. 

   Investigators are probing charges, brought in at least one investor lawsuit, that some of those issues were merely sham transactions to beat the arbitrage deadline of Aug. 31, 1986. 

   In other cases, investigators are probing complaints that underwriters vastly inflated project needs under the bond issues, reaping enormous fees in the process. 
As previously reported, federal regulators are believed to be investigating whether the bond sales actually were completed in time to meet a tax-exemption deadline, and whether the projects to be financed were ever economically viable. 
The size of bond issues generally are reached by agreement of the municipalities and underwriters, usually after some sort of study of the need for the project to be financed. 

   At the same time, many of the issues are structured so that the bond proceeds are locked into escrow accounts and away from developers who were depending on them for payment. 
The developers would then have to find their own interim financing. 
In some cases, the proceeds in escrow were invested in annuities designed to protect the bond investors should the projects be scrapped. 

   "The idea was to generate fees. 
There weren't supposed to be any projects," said one federal investigator familiar with the case. 

   In the case of Matthews &amp; Wright, the Guam and Saipan issues alone, for example, earned the company fees of about $20 million. 
Yet governments on both islands are now pessimistic that the projects, to provide low-income and moderate-income housing, will ever be built, largely because of financing problems encountered by project contractors who expected to be paid through the bond proceeds. 

   Guam business officials, who played some part in formulating project estimates with the public officials and Matthews, now estimate that Guam's foreseeable housing needs are probably less than half the 3,700 units proposed for construction under the $300 million bond sale. 
On Saipan, local contractors say that island's housing needs could be met for about a tenth of the $80 million bond issue. 

   The governments of Guam and Saipan, both U.S. trust territories, have launched their own investigations of the issues and say they are considering filing lawsuits to rescind the bonds and recover underwriting fees. 
Eric Smith, an assistant Saipan attorney general, said the local government also may pursue an investigation of possible collusion among local officials and Matthews. 

   Matthews &amp; Wright also handled a $300 million industrial bond issue for the Pacific island of Palau. 
That issue, which also is under federal scrutiny, is in limbo. 

   "Let's put it this way," said a federal official close to the investigation. 
"Palau has 7,000 people, its government is on the brink of bankruptcy and its cash crop is marijuana. 
You tell me how they were going to spend $300 million." 

   In their investigation of alleged bribes, investigators are known to be focusing on the roles of Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's 45-year-old executive vice president, and Frederick Mann, who is identified in court documents as Matthews &amp; Wright's "authorized representative." 

   In U.S. District Court in Guam, Mr. Goldberg is named in recent court documents as having authorized Mr. Mann to channel $70,000 to the campaign of former Guam Gov. Ricardo J. Bordallo in exchange for Mr. Bordallo's approval of the $300 million Guam bond issue. 

   Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann were identified in an affidavit filed in support of a guilty plea by John Gilliam, an aide to Mr. Bordallo, to a wire fraud charge in connection with the payoffs. 
Mr. Bordallo, however, earlier this year was acquitted of five counts of bribery related to the Matthews &amp; Wright money. 
He was found guilty in federal court of other, unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on Guam. 
He was defeated for re-election last November and is appealing his conviction. 

   Mr. Mann is president of J.D. Moore &amp; Co., a Toronto, Canada, investment concern. 
Mr. Mann, according to records obtained from Saipan's office of corporations, controls Commercial Bank of the Americas, an offshore bank on Saipan through which hundreds of millions of dollars of Matthews &amp; Wright bond proceeds flowed. 

   However, the records show that the government declined to renew Mr. Mann's banking license in 1985 after officials learned that he had failed to reveal an April 1984 fraud conviction in Canada. 

   Federal investigators now say they believe several other unnamed Guam and Saipan officials accepted cash, bogus loans or payments for questionable consulting contracts in exchange for giving their approval to the Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues. 
Investigators are also known to be looking into similar allegations against at least one public official in the East St. Louis bond issue. 

   Authorities investigating the Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues have rejected any nationwide task force, despite the geographical breadth of the issues in question. 
U.S. attorneys' offices and companion agencies in at least six locations, including Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia, are conducting separate but closely linked investigations, federal agents and officials said. 

   William O'Connor, U.S. attorney for the Pacific island region, declined to comment except to say that separate grand juries on Guam and Saipan would be empaneled to investigate the allegations.

A federal judge Thursday overturned the nation's most restrictive abortion law, 
and abortion rights supporters said an appeal of that ruling would threaten the 
Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision 
establishing the right to an abortion, "applied with equal force and effect to 
Guam." 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued that the law did 
not apply to Guam because of the island's status as an unincorporated 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions except when 
the woman's life is in danger. It did not permit abortions in the case of rape 
or incest and made it a crime for someone to advise a woman about an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Munson on March 23 blocked enforcement of the law while he weighed a challenge 
from abortion rights forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat we live with is that the Supreme Court has indicated a willingness 
to overturn Roe vs. Wade," Kate Michelman, executive director of the National 
Abortion Rights Action League, said in a phone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If the governor appeals (Munson's ruling), he will endanger the rights of all 
women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. Our goal is 
to keep these cases out of the courts," Michelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents said that they were not surprised by the judge's decision 
and that the next step probably will be an appeal that would send the case to 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb," said Roland Rivera, vice 
president of Guamanians United for Life. "There is just the next higher level 
to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
"Guam's strong law . . . could not be upheld without overturning Roe vs. Wade," 
said state Rep. Woody Jenkins, lead author of an anti-abortion bill approved by 
the Louisiana Legislature but vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge would follow the 
Roe decision and rule against the Guam law, it must be remembered that this is 
just the first stage in the process," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it violated the free 
speech and due process clauses of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn Roe vs. Wade," 
Simon Heller, an attorney with the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said in a telephone interview from New York.

   Hours before he was to leave the island to
begin a prison term, a former two-term governor of Guam chained
himself to a public statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and
fatally shot himself in the head.
   Found at the base of the statue were four handwritten placards,
one of which said, ``I regret I only have one life to give for my
island,'' according to police Lt. Phil Dennis.
   Former Gov. Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 62, shot himself
Wednesday less than four hours before he was to fly to Los Angeles,
where he was to visit his daughter before reporting to the federal
correctional facility at Boron, Calif., to begin a four-year prison
term for witness tampering and obstruction.
   ``I choose death before dishonor,'' Bordallo wrote on another
placard. ``My loving wife ... has my message which she will impart
to the people of Guam in due time.''
   An aide to his wife, territorial Sen. Madeleine Bordallo, said
the senator had not found such a message.
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for Bordallo earlier in
the day said he had appeared to be in good spirits.
   ``I didn't think this would happen,'' Congressional Del. Ben
Blaz said from Washington. ``Ricky Bordallo always seemed to bounce
back from his many adversities.''
   At a busy downtown intersection, Bordallo shot himself with a
.38-caliber pistol while chained to the statue of Chief Quipuha,
the first chief in Guam to adopt Christianity, Dennis said.
   He died a short time later of massive brain damage, according to
a spokesman at the Guam Naval Hospital. Mrs. Bordallo was
reportedly with him when he died.
   Territorial flags were lowered to half-staff, and Gov. Joseph
Ada declared a state of mourning until after Bordallo's funeral,
which is yet to be scheduled.
   Bordallo told the Pacific Daily News in an interview last Friday
that he was facing his prison term with ``complete serenity.''
   ``When a man is innocent, his conscience is clear, and he is at
peace with himself,'' Bordallo said.
   But he also said: ``My own instincts make me believe that I will
not be coming back from Boron alive. I'm not dwelling on how it
will happen. I will be in the hands of people who are masters of
intrigue.''
   Bordallo was found guilty in February 1987 of getting engineer
Johnny Carpio to lie to federal officials about a $60,000 political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   During his trial, Bordallo admitted accepting money from the
businessmen, but contended the money was a campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted of extortion and bribery and was placed on
five years' probation.
   Bordallo, a Democrat, served as governor from 1974 to 1978, and
again from 1982 to 1986, when he was defeated by Republican Ada.

   Gov. Joseph Ada's chief counsel contends in
court papers that the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing
the right to an abortion does not apply to this U.S. territory.
   The memorandum argued that Roe vs. Wade and Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, the July decision giving states more
authority to restrict abortion without overturning the earier
ruling, are not in force in Guam because it is a territory.
   Ada signed the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion measure
into law last month. Enforcement remains on hold pending a hearing
in federal court May 8 on a challenge brought by a woman who wants
an abortion.
   Katherine Maraman, the governor's legal counsel, and attorney
Monessa Lujan argued that many of the Constitution's due process
and equal-protection provisions do not fully apply to Guam in
recognition of its traditions.
   The new law, if upheld by the court, would make it a felony for
doctors to perform abortions and a misdemeanor for women to have
abortions, except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the
mother's life.
   The measure also makes it a misdemeanor to solicit women to have
an abortion.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to authorize its staff to charge Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. and several officers of that bond house with fraud and other securities law violations, according to people familiar with the situation. 

   The action occurred Tuesday at a closed meeting and wasn't announced. 
It authorizes the SEC's enforcement staff to enter into settlement negotiations and, if those fail, to file suit alleging a host of violations in connection with Matthews &amp; Wright's role as underwriter of more than $1 billion of municipal bonds and as issuer of its own stock, the individuals said. 

   The vote, though unannounced, appears to kick off a kind of fall offensive by the SEC against abuses in the municipal-bond market. 
The agency is scheduled to release today the results of its investigation into Washington Public Power Supply System's gigantic 1983 $2.25 billion municipal-bond default. 
It also plans today to decide in an open meeting whether to release a broader report on the municipal-bond market in general, perhaps to demonstrate that the WPPSS case isn't an anomaly, as some on Wall Street contend. 
Finally, it will vote on whether to propose for comment a rule designed to enhance disclosure in the municipal market. 

   By taking action against Matthews &amp; Wright and proposing changes in the way the municipal-bond market works, the SEC may hope to assuage some in Congress who expressed outrage when it was reported this year that the commission had rejected its staff's recommendation to bring charges in the WPPSS matter. 

   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, couldn't be reached for comment. 
An agency spokeswoman declined to comment. 

   David Aufhauser, a Matthews &amp; Wright attorney, said, "I've had discussions with the commission staff, but I can't comment beyond that." 
Matthews &amp; Wright has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and insists that all its municipal-bond underwritings conformed with industry practices. 

   The SEC's charges pertain to about 25 municipal-bond deals underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright in 1985 and 1986, and to an offering of 1.5 million shares of its stock in August 1986. 
The SEC case doesn't include Matthews &amp; Wright's best-known deals, the $380 million of controversial issues underwritten for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 1984 and 1985. 

   The agency may have chosen not to include the Pacific issues in part because they are being scrutinized by other arms of the U.S. government. 

   Last year, a federal grand jury in Guam charged Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
Mr. Goldberg, who is on a voluntary leave of absence from the firm, pleaded innocent, and is scheduled to go on trial in January. 

   Last month, the Internal Revenue Service said interest income on the Guam and Marianas bonds isn't exempt from taxes. 
The tax-exempt status is the major selling point of municipal bonds. 
New York-based Matthews &amp; Wright responded that it believes the issues were made validly and that the interest income is tax exempt. 

   In addition to Mr. Goldberg, the Matthews &amp; Wright officials who could be charged by the SEC are Chairman George Benoit and Roger Burns, treasurer and chief financial officer. 
Also listed is Bernard Althoff, who is identified as the firm's outside corporate counsel.

   Gov. Joseph Ada posted an easy victory
Tuesday, making the Republican the first governor to win
back-to-back terms in the U.S. territory's history.
   With all 76 precincts reporting, Ada received 20,677 votes to
Democrat Madeleine Bordallo's 15,688 votes, the Guam Election
Commission reported.
   Final official tallies are expected Wednesday, the commission
said.
   The abortion issue was not a factor in the vote, as both
candidates oppose abortion and support a court challenge to a
decision striking down the territory's restrictive abortion law.
   Bordallo, the first woman and non-native Guamanian to run for
governor, is the widow of former Gov. Ricardo Bordallo. Her husband
committed suicide Jan. 30, one day before he was to begin an
18-month federal prison term in California. He was not in office at
the time of his death.
   In the territory's congressional election, Republican Ben Blaz

<HEAD>Guam Wants US Reparations for Japanese Damage in WWII</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guam wants the United States to pay millions of
dollars in reparations for the brutal Japanese occupation of the
Pacific island during World War II, a debt the U.S. government
forgave in 1951 for diplomatic reasons.
   ``Although we feel that a moral obligation'' falls on Japan, ``we
cannot seek justice from the Japanese,'' said Joseph F. Ada,
governor of the U.S. territory located only 1,150 miles from Tokyo.
   From 1941-44, Guam suffered through some of the most brutal
treatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recall
massacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors.
   But the United States ``most unfortunately gave away our right to
reparation from the Japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with Japan ...
without anybody once asking our people,'' according to Ada.
   The Bush administration opposes reparations, saying the U.S.
government spent $8 million immediately after the war on 4,200
death, personal injury and property damage claims.
   ``There is no reason for the American taxpayers to pay further
compensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,''
said Larry L. Morgan of the Interior Department, which in 1950 took
over responsibility for Guam from the Navy.
   A Guam Reparations Commission appointed this year asked for
compensation totaling $160 million to include payments for deaths,
injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment.
   The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean
War, ``was a policy decision of the United States to conclude a
quick treaty with Japan ... to turn Japan into a valuable Asian ally
and a bulwark against communist expansion,'' Ada said.
   Ada appeared last month at a hearing on Guam war reparations
legislation introduced by Ben Blaz, Guam's non-voting delegate in
the House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and a
possible committee vote later this year.
   The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size of
Rhode Island _ was acquired from Spain in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War. It remains a key U.S. Pacific military base.
   Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boosting
the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the
500,000 annual visitors to Guam's beaches.
   Blaz and Ada say the new payments are justified in light of $67
million paid in Micronesian war claims and the $20,000 authorized by
Congress for each Japanese-American interned during World War II.
   Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and
there was confusion over the eligibility of Guam natives, who
received U.S. citizenship only in 1950, said Blaz.
   Guam senator Eddie Duenas said: ``Apparently, many who were
eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or
were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.''
   A Guamanian woman, Mrs. Beatrice Perez Emsley, recalled during
the summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness
in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, native
tribespeople.
   She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there without
realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used
a bayonet instead of sword.
   ``I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the
dirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keep
still or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,''
she said.
   Mrs. Emsley, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle and
wandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her.
Years later, they met members of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division who
were liberating the island.
   Reparations ``will not remove from us the awful memories of the
horrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they ``will
show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.''
   Duenas, the senator, said that the United States made death
payments ranging as low as $221 and high as $3,500 to 750 people on
Guam after the war.
   Island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of the
population, or up to 2,000 people, were killed and 90 percent
suffered severe hardship, injury or disease.
   The Blaz bill contained an initial authorization for $20 million,

A major earthquake rocked the Northern Mariana Islands this morning, and 
seismologists pinpointed its epicenter off Anatahan Island, about 230 miles 
north of Guam. The island was evacuated two days earlier amid mounting fears 
that its volcano was erupting. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hattori of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Guam said the temblor had 
a magnitude of 7.4 and placed its epicenter in the Marianas Trench, one of the 
world's deepest ocean chasms, in the Western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Larry Guerrero of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands issued 
a tidal wave warning for Saipan and Tinian islands, part of the island cluster 
that comprise the U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:14 a.m. jolt startled residents from their sleep on Guam and several 
other islands in the Mariana chain, but there were no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries.

<HEAD>SEC Said to Authorizes Civil Charges Against New York Bond House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
authorized its staff to charge Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. and
several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in
connection with the underwriting of more than $1 billion in
municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
   Quoting what it called people familiar with the situation, the
newspaper said the SEC took the unannounced step at a closed-door
meeting Tuesday. The reported action followed a major inquiry into
the New York firm's activities.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined comment on the Journal
report, in accordance with the agency's policy on enforcement
matters.
   But the SEC had stated in a previously published notice that its
agenda for the Tuesday session included ``institution of
administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature.''
   David Aufhauser, a Matthews &amp; Wright attorney, was not
immediately available to comment, a receptionist said. The Journal
quoted him as saying he'd had discussions with the SEC staff but
could not elaborate.
   Matthews &amp; Wright has consistently denied wrongdoing and has
asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices.
   The Journal quoted sources as saying the SEC action means the
agency's enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations
with Matthews &amp; Wright. If those fail, the sources were quoted as
saying, the SEC may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses.
   Most of the charges stem from Matthews &amp; Wright's role as an
underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986, the
sources were quoted as saying.
   The SEC case doesn't include the firm's best-known deals, $380
million in questionable issues underwritten for Guam and the
Northern Mariana islands in 1984 and 1985, the newspaper quoted
sources as saying.
   It was unclear why these were omitted, but the newspaper said it
may have been because other government enforcement agencies are
scrutinizing them.
   Last year a federal grand jury in Guam charged Arthur Abba
Goldberg, the firm's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery
and obstruction of justice. He's pleaded innocent and will go on
trial in January.
   In August, the Internal Revenue Service decreed that interest
income on the Guam and Mariana bonds aren't tax-exempt. This is
significant because the tax-exempt status of such issues is a major
selling point of municipal bonds.
