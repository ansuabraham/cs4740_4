FT  15 OCT 93 / Uruguay Round draws fire from Perot camp

MR ROSS PEROT, the Texas billionaire, is refusing comment on a report that
he will pitch his political organisation, United We Stand, and his extensive
resources behind opposition to a Uruguay Round agreement, Nancy Dunne writes
from Washington.
A spokesman for United We Stand said he has not yet taken a position on the
Round, in order to focus his energies on defeating the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Mr Perot co-wrote a book detailing criticism of Nafta after
claiming, during the presidential debates, that 'a giant sucking sound'
would draw American jobs over the US-Mexican border.
His co-author, Mr Pat Choate, yesterday said he opposed Uruguay Round
provisions weakening US dumping laws and establish-ing a multilateral
trading organisation to oversee the world trading system.
Ms Lori Wallach, a prominent anti-Nafta organiser with Public Citizen, which
works closely with the Perot forces, said many of the same groups which
oppose the Nafta will also fight a Uruguay Round pact.
'Ross Perot feels about Nafta the way a vampire feels about garlic,' she
said. 'Ross Perot feels about Gatt the way a vampire feels about daylight.
One he regards with revulsion; the other means death.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton hails Nafta vote by Congress - US
now has 'economic, political and moral standing' to push for conclusion to
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A JUBILANT President Bill Clinton flew off to his Asian summit in Seattle
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress and promising new
initiatives to liberalise word trade.
Approval on Wednesday night by the House of Representatives of the North
American Free Trade Agreement was, he declared on the White House lawn, 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the Asian leaders but also in the
final push successfully to conclude a new Uruguay Round of global trading
talks. Vital Gatt talks are to be held next week in Washington between Mr
Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC
commissioner.
The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited Vice President Al
Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process.
The new trading bloc, which also includes Canada, is to take effect on
January 1.
The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement until late in the
evening. The majority was composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of
the 258 Democrats, with the sole independent voting against.
Before he went to bed, Mr Clinton signed letters of thanks to all who had
voted in favour and hoped that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the
day could be applied to other great upcoming issues, such as health care
reform.
But the president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition
and to heal the open wounds in his own Democratic Party, especially with
organised labour. He promised new initiatives on education and worker
retraining, while Mr Gore said the administration was 'uncomfortable in
being in disagreement with the folks we normally fight along with, side by
side.'
Trade union leaders, however, were unmollified. The full hierarchy of the
AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to regret
Nafta's passage.
'It has little to do with the national interest,' said Mr Lane Kirkland,
AFL-CIO president, but was 'a secure means of escape' from US laws for US
and multinational corporations. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians,
warned those Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're gonna make sure we get
even at the polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes
next week would be duly noticed, too. Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta
debate, also threatened retaliation by his independent movement.
Mr Jim Jontz, director of the Citizens' Trade Campaign against Nafta,
promised similar scrutiny of a Uruguay Round agreement. 'I feel we already
won because clearly Nafta could not be sold on its merits and the president
had to start dealing to get votes.'
Republican leaders were generally pleased with the co-operation with the
White House over an accord first negotiated by President Bush. Several said
Nafta would have failed without overwhelming Republican support and that,
therefore, the party could no longer be accused of perpetuating 'gridlock'
in Washington.
But a Congress staff member predicted 'serious disagreements' with Mr
Clinton on health care and spending cuts.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Chicago back-room operator to sell Nafta -
Laurie Morse on a Daley drafted in to lead ratification drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get
his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in
international trade arenas. But he comes to Washington well prepared for the
kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a
divided Congress to pass it.
William Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago's mayor
Richard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine 'Boss',
the late Richard J Daley. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,
45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with
important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised
labour. He has never run for political office.
Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet
position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton's chief negotiator at
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
He chaired Mr Clinton's election campaign in Illinois, where he delivered 48
per cent of the vote to Clinton, above the national average, and continues
as a tangible supporter. Most recently, he arranged a posh Chicago dinner
for the president that raised Dollars 1m (Pounds 670,000).
However, Mr Daley's appointment to chair the White House's task force on the
North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent
polls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support
Nafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.
Mr Clinton himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under
George Bush's administration, until side agreements dealing with
environmental and labour issues were reached last month. Many Democrats in
Congress, including some in the powerful Illinois delegation, are
uncommitted. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by
January 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and
visible.
Mr Daley was chosen for the job, Chicago observers say, because he has
proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a
controversial battle. 'Bill Daley is no Washington neophyte. Clinton needs
someone with political sense to move this thing through Congress, and Daley
has the connections,' says a fellow Washington lobbyist.
Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a
potential political pothole for Mr Clinton. Mr Daley's talents have been
summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the
agreement.
The president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta. The
administration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement. Clinton
ally and fellow Chicago Democrat, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his
committee. However, Mr Rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use
of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.
By rough count, Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic
representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement:
those along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer
product, or manufacturing export interests.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the
public tactics of Nafta's most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot. Mr Perot's
populist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will be
heard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border.
'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,' says Chicago political
commentator Mr Bruce DuMont. 'Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber. You may
not see him, but you'll see the results.'
Mr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead the
Nafta push. He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint as
president of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, which was founded by the
Amalgamated Textile Workers union in 1922. Although it passed into private
ownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile union
officials.
Mr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley's union ties to help the Nafta effort.
However, Mr Daley, by pushing Nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union
supporters. Mr Jim Jontz, former congressman from Indiana and director of
the anti-Nafta Citizen's Trade Campaign, said: 'I don't know why Bill Daley
would want to be in a position like that. It's just wrong.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Congress gears up for vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDESPREAD assumption is that if the North American Free Trade Agreement
is defeated in the House of Representatives tonight the cause of liberalised
world trade is in deep trouble.
There is little doubt, for example, that an even bigger cloud will promptly
gather over the head of the Uruguay Round, itself due to be completed by the
congressionally mandated deadline of December 15.
Yet there is one element in this equation which may not stand up to scrutiny
 -that a defeat for Nafta denotes such a depth of protectionism in Congress
that even if the Round is concluded it, too, would face certain rejection on
Capitol Hill.
The pro-Nafta forces, led with exceptional intensity as the vote approaches
by President Bill Clinton, understandably prefer to confine public
connections between the two to warnings of the fearful consequences for the
wider agreement and for the damage a Nafta defeat would inflict on US
leadership as it pursues a more open global trading regime.
In private, however, Nafta's supporters, and even some of its opponents,
will even go so far as to argue that a cathartic rejection of the
hemispheric pact would, if anything, reinforce prospects of the Uruguay
Round getting through. But to admit this openly would, for the
administration, have the effect of lowering the stakes and thus raising
chances of Nafta's rejection.
Everything, of course, initially depends on there being a Gatt agreement at
all, the hopes for which will certainly not be improved if Nafta goes down.
But US diplomats are quite encouraged by signals from Europe that French
resistance to agricultural concessions may be softening and that it will not
use a defeat for Nafta as a cover for its own refusal to reach agreement in
the Uruguay Round.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, is understood to have been particularly
impressed by last week's OECD report which concluded that a Gatt agreement
could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn by 2002, the highest
independent estimate yet of the potential accrued benefits.
But the key to the more optimistic US private scenario is the sense that it
will be hard to duplicate in Congress the sort of opposition to the Uruguay
Round that, win or lose, has characterised the Nafta debate.
Some elements of the anti-Nafta coalition, which includes the far right and
the progressive left, will remain dead set against the Uruguay Round. Mr
Ralph Nader's populist consumer movement, for example, sees it as yet
another plot by multinational corporations to extend their hegemony over the
international economy.
The 'America First' lobby, associated with Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative
ideologue-politician, is inherently suspicious of international
entanglements. Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential
candidate, is also making threatening noises against the Round. But the
clout of the populists in Congress still does not even remotely approximate
that of organised labour.
And the trade union movement, which has made Nafta into such an immediate
life-or-death jobs issue that it has entered into unholy alliances with the
populists of the right, has no record of entrenched opposition to global
trading accords as a matter of first principle.
Indeed, since President Kennedy secured passage in 1962 of his Trade
Expansion Act, no global bill has faced a tough fight in Congress. This is
essentially because congressmen, including those on the left of the
Democratic Party, do not like being labelled protectionist. Vice president
Al Gore knows this full well from his years in Congress.
Gatt agreements, often imperfectly understood on Capitol Hill, rarely can be
construed to pose particular threats to the constituencies of individual
members. As one lobbyist observed this week, 'It is hard to get people in
Evanston, Illinois, excited about competition from Malaysia.'
Nafta, on the other hand, deals with two neighbours, Canada and Mexico, the
second of whom is demonstrably different from the US politically, socially,
and in its economic development. It is a very particular US policy
initiative, with no exact antecedents.
Any consolation that believers in free trade may take from the above
argument does not reduce the importance of tonight's vote. Even allowing for
the hyperboles being thrown by both sides, the US political bottom line is
that the authority of the president is at stake, as may be the political
future of this incumbent, Bill Clinton. This, in turn, has imponderable
international ramifications on issues way beyond free trade.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Trade pact vote hanging in the balance: Arm-twisting on
Nafta will go on to the last minute before the US Congress decides
</HEADLINE>

THE debating, cajoling and arm-twisting will continue up to the very last
minute this week as members of Congress prepare for Wednesday's crucial vote
in the House of Representatives on the North American Free Trade Agreement
with Mexico and Canada.
The congressional votes have been counted, recounted and double-counted, and
still no-one can predict the outcome with real confidence.
'The undecided members of Congress still hold the balance,' Vice-President
Al Gore said yesterday.
If Nafta passes the House, it is expected to be approved more easily by the
Senate. It would then come into effect on January 1, lowering tariffs and
dismantling trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico.
President Bill Clinton said this weekend that he had won 27 members over to
Nafta in the three days since Mr Gore debated the issue with Mr Ross Perot
on television, and claimed to have the necessary momentum to win on
Wednesday. One more member, Ms Maria Cantwell, was due to announce her
support yesterday, despite Mr Perot's anti-Nafta rally in her Seattle
district.
But Congressman David Bonior, the Democratic whip who is leading the battle
in Congress against Nafta, said he had topped the 218 needed to win in the
434-member House.
'We have about 222 votes going into this weekend and we think we are going
to hold our votes,' Mr Bonior said yesterday, though other anti-Nafta
campaigners said they wanted a cushion of at least eight or nine members to
counter last-minute defections.
The White House's strategy for winning the Nafta vote is built on gaining
around 100 of the House's 258 Democrats and around 120 of the 175
Republicans.
Some pro-Nafta campaigners believe they will have the Democratic votes they
are counting on, but worry that the Republicans are so far assured of only
105 members and will be hard pressed to find their 120-vote contribution.
In the last month, however, the administration has been hard at work on a
wider spread of side-deals to alloy the doubts of wavering members.
'The only deal that hasn't been made is for working families,' Mr Bonior
complained.
Votes have been hard to buy. Deals on citrus and sugar won fewer vote
commitments than the White House had hoped for, and the promise of a North
American Development Bank doubled its yield this week when Congressman Ed
Pastor cited it as a reason he would vote for Nafta.
Asparagus growers and airlines have also received a helping hand, but the
administration denied that it had promised to build sewers or bridges in the
districts of uncommitted members.
What many congressmen are looking for, however, is a political umbrella. Mr
Clinton offered one to hesitant Republicans by promising to help them in
next year's congressional elections if his fellow Democrats bring up their
vote for Nafta against them.
Congressional vote counters say that Nafta is unlikely to pass by more than
one or two votes, if it passes at all. Several members of Congress may have
promised the president that theirs will not be the vote that kills the trade
pact; if the Ayes top 218, there will be a rush of these provisional Nafta
supporters to vote No.

                         can be expected to the last minute, as the US

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday raised the prospect of a broad free trade
zone in the western hemisphere by putting the whole of Latin America back at
the centre of US trade policy.
Speaking at a White House press conference, he promised to build on the
North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico by
expanding it to include free-market democracies such as Argentina and Chile.
The president, who has been fighting an uphill battle to win Congress
approval for Nafta, predicted that the House of Representatives would give
its backing in its deciding vote next week. 'I honestly believe we're going
to win it now,' he said.
Mr Clinton said he did not want to exaggerate the potential job gains to be
derived from Nafta alone, although he believed it was clear it would create
more jobs than it lost.
Much greater opportunities would come, however, when the pact could be
expanded to other market-oriented economies and with the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
'The real job growth . . . will come when all the other Latin American
democracies and free-market economies also join in a great trade group with
Mexico, Canada and the US.
'And it will come because, once this happens, we will have enormously
increased influence in the world community to argue that we ought to adopt a
worldwide trade agreement before the end of the year,' he added.
After Tuesday night's Nafta debate between vice-president Al Gore and Mr
Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, Mr Clinton sought
to portray next week's Congress vote as critical for the US's ability to
negotiate freer trade opportunities from its partners not only in Latin
America but also in the Uruguay Round.
Mr Gore warned in the debate that a defeat for Nafta would make conclusion
of the Gatt round difficult.
An expansion of Nafta to include the rest of Latin America was promised by
Mr Clinton's predecessor, Mr George Bush. But little has been heard of such
talk in recent months as the prospects of Congress accepting free trade even
with neighbouring Mexico seemed so remote.
Mexican stocks soared 81.49 points to a record close at 2,035.33, and the
peso recovered because of optimism over the result of the Gore-Perot debate.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Clinton steps up campaign for backing over Nafta: President
accuses unions of 'roughshod' tactics on free trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton turned up the political heat yesterday on opponents
of the North American Free Trade Agreement by accusing US organised labour
of using 'roughshod, muscle-bound' tactics to defeat the agreement in
Congress.
His attack on the labour movement, a traditional bastion of his own
Democratic party, underlined the importance he is attaching to the Nafta
vote in the House of Representatives on November 17.
The vote is widely seen as crucial not just to ratification of the accord
between the US, Canada and Mexico but also to US trade policy in general and
to the success of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, due to be
completed by December 15.
Mr Clinton, whose comments came in a morning television interview, left the
impression that he was more concerned about pressure being exerted on
members of Congress by the trade unions - by threatening to withhold
financial support and to run candidates against Nafta supporters - than he
was by the publicity campaign waged against Nafta by Mr Ross Perot, the
Texas billionaire and last year's independent presidential candidate.
The president also criticised US business for not doing enough to support
Nafta, at least compared with labour's grassroots campaign against the
agreement. But he was confident that Vice-President Al Gore would acquit
himself well in his televised debate with Mr Perot, scheduled for prime time
tomorrow night, because of his 'command of the facts'.
Mr Perot, warming up for the TV encounter, yesterday afternoon addressed
supporters in Tampa, Florida, and claimed there was evidence that he was to
be the target of an assassination attempt by a pro-Nafta group either at
Tampa or at the debate with Mr Gore.
Mr Clinton, in his interview, said Mr Perot was adept at 'keeping things
stirred up'. He denied he was boosting Mr Perot's apparently declining
popularity by agreeing to the debate, noting that 'he has enough money to
elevate himself'. The president remained confident that Nafta would have the
votes by November 17, even though they did not exist today. In particular,
he emphasised the safeguard clauses in Nafta's 'side agreements' protecting
against surges in imports from Mexico.
Only if these proved inadequate and there was overwhelming evidence that the
US was losing jobs would he contemplate renegotiating Nafta.
But Congressman David Bonior of Michigan, chief Nafta opponent in the House,
claimed yesterday to be 'on the brink' of winning the 217 votes needed to
vote the agreement down.
Mr Clinton stressed the serious international consequences of rejecting the
agreement. It would, he said, send the wrong message to Asian leaders he was
to meet in Seattle the day after the House vote - a view echoed yesterday by
the Senate Republican leader, Mr Robert Dole.
Passage, on the other hand, would constitute 'a clear statement' that the US
was intent on 'competing and winning' in international markets and was
committed to global free trade. It would put additional pressure on Asia and
Europe to complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks by the mid-December
deadline.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's first big challenge: meet
Salinas and save Nafta - The two men have much in common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON his maiden foray into international diplomacy, President-elect Bill
Clinton is going only one state away - to Austin, Texas, where he will today
meet Mexican President Carlos Salinas.
The two presidents will find they have much in common. Both attended
university abroad (Mr Clinton in the UK, Mr Salinas in the US) and became
young government reformers with pro-business views. Both are 'policy wonks'
 -fascinated with the technicalities of making government work. They are
both 'baby boomers' and know that unless they 'bond' swiftly, the future of
the North American Free Trade Agreement - involving the US, Mexico and
Canada - is at risk.
However, Mr Clinton assured Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney by
telephone yesterday that he would not be left out of any serious discussions
with Mexico on Nafta. The meeting with Mr Salinas would only be a
'get-acquainted session'.
It was Mr Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate, who fanned the
burning coals of public doubt about Nafta into blazing opposition during the
televised campaign debates. The quirky Texas billionaire repeatedly claimed
to hear 'a sucking sound' to the south, drawing US manufacturing jobs out of
the country.
Those who opposed the agreement - carefully cultivated by grassroots
environmental, labour and citizen groups - had little difficulty in
extracting promises from numerous congressmen to oppose the treaty. It
stands in danger of defeat.
Mr Clinton should have already won favour with the Mexican president, by
agreeing not to demand a renegotiation. Instead he promised to negotiate
'supplemental' agreements to protect the environment and labour standards
and guard against import surges.
Among Mr Clinton's Democratic supporters are three factions: business
groups, which care only that Nafta offers opportunity for new investment,
markets and cheap labour; the opponents, who believe the pact can be
improved with tough enforcement measures; and those - many in unions - who
will work to kill any deal.
There is also organised opposition in both Canada and Mexico, and the
citizens from the three countries will marry their views in a common paper
to be delivered this month.
Although there are some differences in interpretation of the Nafta text,
most opponents say the current version would depress wages and employment
levels, diminish labour rights and standards, degrade the environment and
promote massive migration and human rights violations.
'Nafta is by no stretch of the imagination free trade,' says Ms Thea Lee of
the labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'It is an investment
agreement and a sophisticated form of managed trade for the multinational
corporations.'
The Economic Strategy Institute, in a recent report called 'Nafta: Making it
Better', concluded that the pact as it now stands would stimulate foreign
investment in Mexico, but at the expense of US industry.
The opposition has grown so strong that Washington lobbyists acknowledge the
necessity of negotiating the side agreements and presenting them as a 'new'
Nafta, different from the one savaged by Mr Perot.
'We have to reposition the issue to take the focus away from the loss of
manufacturing jobs and focus on the overall closer economic and political
relationship between two neighbours,' says Mr Harry Freeman, a trade
lobbyist.
Those willing to accept a 'new' Nafta want one which would encourage
pollution clean-up in Mexico, raise standards of food safety, and boost the
living standards of Mexican workers. Their goal is 'the EC model' under
which countries were only admitted after democratic reforms took root and
the poorer countries are given compensatory payment for social programmes.
Mr Clinton has promised to establish a strong environmental protection
commission with substantial powers and resources to prevent and clean up
water pollution and encourage enforcement of air pollution laws.
But he has been vague about the relationship between the side agreements and
the original Nafta text. The critics will insist that this linkage be
formalised, so failure by any of the three governments to meet their
obligations on environment and labour could be punished by higher tariffs.
Mr Clinton will also have to make changes to the proposed dispute settlement
mechanism, according to Mr Alex Hittle, a spokesman for Friends of the
Earth, who is willing to support 'a Nafta with teeth'. The president-elect
apparently envisions a process under which citizen groups would take their
complaints to US officials, who would then pass them to their Mexican or
Canadian partners.
Environmentalists want the process opened to public participation. The
current text says both sides in a dispute must agree before outsiders are
brought into the process.
Mr Clinton will be leaned on hard, and he will have to press Mr Salinas, who
in turn has signalled that the price of new negotiations could be a
multi-billion-dollar fund to help pay for Mexico to develop infrastructure
and clean up its environmental. He may also reopen talks about labour
mobility.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges trade initiatives: Approval of Nafta hailed
as boost for Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JUBILANT US president Bill Clinton arrived in Seattle for his Asian summit
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress, and promising new
initiatives to liberalise world trade.
His mission, he said, was to drive down world trade barriers as a spur to US
economic revival.
Earlier, Mr Clinton declared from the White House lawn that the House of
Representatives' approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement was 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group but also in the push for a successful conclusion
to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
Mr Clinton's optimism was echoed by trade officials in Europe who said the
Nafta vote had improved the chances of an agreement on trade liberalisation
measures under the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by
the December 15 deadline.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, said: 'There is no negotiator
in Geneva today who isn't breathing a sigh of relief as a result of the
vote.'
The Nafta debate had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several weeks, tying
US negotiators' hands even though time was perilously short. It is now hoped
that talks next week in Washington between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner, will give
long-awaited impetus to the negotiations.
The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited US vice-president
Al Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process. The new trading
bloc, which includes Canada, is to take effect on January 1.
The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement. The majority was
composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of the 258 Democrats, with
the sole independent voting against.
Yesterday, Mr Clinton thanked all who had voted in favour of Nafta and hoped
that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the day could be applied to
other great issues facing the US, such as healthcare reform.
The president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition and to
heal the open wounds in his especially with organised labour.
Trade union leaders remained unmollified. The full hierarchy of the AFL-CIO,
the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to express regret
at Nafta's passage. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians, warned those
Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're going to make sure we get even at the
polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes next week
would be duly noticed, too.
Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta debate, also threatened retaliation by
his independent movement.
US stocks fell after investors took the Nafta vote as a signal to take
profits. The Dow closed off 19.01 points at 3,685.34.
In Geneva, Mr Sutherland, at a briefing to underline trade liberalising
moves that have already been provisionally agreed, warned of difficulties
ahead. He said: 'The overall picture is heartening, but there are still
significant difficulties in bringing the round to a conclusion.'
In Brussels, Sir Leon said the vote would remove a big distraction for the
US and allow a final drive for a Gatt agreement.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Clinton still requires a winning Nafta vision: The
president's uphill battle to win the hearts of Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton tomorrow formally launches his uphill battle to make the
North American Free Trade Agreement acceptable to a dubious US Congress.
With ex-presidents Bush, Carter and Ford expected at the White House for a
Rose Garden ceremony, Mr Clinton will sign the supplemental agreements on
labour, environment and import surges negotiated over seven months with
Canada and Mexico.
The White House is also hoping to acquire the salesmanship skills of Mr Lee
Iacocca, former head of Chrysler and a pitchman notable enough to challenge
Mr Ross Perot, leader of the strong Nafta opposition.
There is now a determination in the White House to portray the pact, along
with its side agreements, as 'Clinton's Nafta' and therefore one which
should be more acceptable to labour and environmentalists. However, if the
side pacts have won any adherents, they have yet to announce their
conversion.
As is usual with trade issues, the spotlight is on Mr Richard Gephardt, the
House majority leader, whose backing is seen as key to Nafta's passage in
the House. Mr Gephardt leaves a tantalising opening in his current
insistence that he cannot support the pact - as it stands.
Mr Gephardt has been demanding for a long time a fixed funding source,
dedicated to pay for environmental clean-ups at the US-Mexican border and
for worker retraining. An outline of the financing plans may be released
tomorrow.
The administration plans to propose a scaled down version of a North
American Development Bank. However, this could be expanded by Congress,
where there is support for an institution capable also of start-up business
loans in districts threatened by job losses.
Currently, the proposal is to limit the Nadbank to environmental projects at
the border and to locate it within the InterAmerican Development Bank.
However, congressional supporters of a larger bank may well prevail when the
plan gets to Capitol Hill.
It has been suggested that Mr Gephardt might find acceptable a cross-border
tax which would provide the embryonic funding for a Nadbank. The tax would
be 'finite' - in place only until it raised the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
currently envisaged from the US and Mexico for paid-in capital - which may
make it acceptable to the business lobby.
Vice President Al Gore yesterday suggested that the implementation of Nafta
may be delayed beyond its scheduled launch on January 1 1994. He
acknowledged that the vote may not come until early next year, but scoffed
at press reports that the administration is backing away from the
controversial agreement.
The White House has established a Nafta 'war room', reminiscent of the
quick-response team which won high praise for its wit and speed in last
year's presidential campaign. Nafta captains are in place - Mr Bill Daley,
an accomplished Democratic backroom deal-maker, and Mr Bill Frenzel, a
former Minnesota Republican congressman - although neither has been visible
much in public.
Mr Clinton's lack of enthusiasm in defending Nafta has fuelled doubts about
his commitment to the cause. He has seemed remote from the fray, unable to
inspire the public and unwilling to articulate a vision of an expanded home
market with more jobs to gain than to lose. He can hardly be pleased about
the rift it is creating between the moderate and liberal wings of the
Democratic party.
However, reports that the White House is backing away from Nafta have
'enraged' the administration. One jubilant official said: 'The political
will is there; the fight is now starting.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Liberal party softens its approach to
freer trade - Trade Pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Liberal party has substantially softened its stand on North
American free trade since the last general election in 1988. During that
election, which they lost, the Liberals made abrogation of the US-Canada
free trade pact a key plank of their policy platform.
By this year's campaign, however, the Liberals had pledged only to seek
renegotiation of some elements of the 1989 accord, the FTA, and the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico. 'Abrogating trade
agreements should only be a last resort if satisfactory changes cannot be
negotiated,' the Liberals' campaign platform said.
Nafta is due to come into force on January 1 1994. Diplomats and political
observers predict that, with a little help from President Bill Clinton, the
US Congress and the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the Liberals
will eventually sign on to Nafta in time to meet the implementation date.
The outgoing Progressive Conservative government pushed Nafta enabling
legislation through Parliament last summer. Only formal promulgation is
required to put it into law.
The Liberals pledged in the campaign to seek four specific 'improvements' to
the FTA and Nafta: a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code, a more effective
dispute settlement mechanism, and the same protection for Canadian energy
producers as is envisaged for Mexico.
Some Liberal concerns would be addressed if the Uruguay Round is
successfully wrapped up this year. The previous Conservative government
tried but failed to negotiate a subsidies package in the 1989 FTA.
Anti-Nafta pressure on Mr Chretien would also be eased if the US Congress
ratifies Nafta. Votes are scheduled in the Senate and the House of
Representatives next month.
On other issues, diplomats predict that Ottawa and Washington will find a
face-saving formula which will enable Mr Chretien to point out that his
concerns are being met, and allow him to proceed with implementation of
Nafta. A visit to Washington will be among the new prime minister's early
priorities.
President Clinton said yesterday he did not expect the election to have an
impact on Nafta.
The results of the election should also make it easier for Mr Chretien to
press ahead with Nafta. The left-leaning New Democratic Party, the only
parliamentary group unambiguously opposed to Nafta, ended up with only eight
seats in the House of Commons. The two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois
and the Reform party, which will form the bulk of the opposition, generally
favour the free trade agreements.
Even within the Liberal party itself, support for free trade is more vocal
and opposition more muted than it was five years ago.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Gore-Perot joust seen as gamble for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has taken a political gamble in sending Vice
President Al Gore into televised battle with Ross Perot, the Texas populist,
on the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The confrontation was last night fixed for Tuesday evening in Tampa,
Florida, with Larry King, the talk show host, as moderator. There may be
other TV debates before the House of Representatives votes on Nafta on
November 17. Mr Clinton is giving a hour-long interview on one of tomorrow's
regular Sunday morning current affairs programmes. Nafta is certain to
consume a fair part of this.
Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, warned Congress of the
dire consequences of rejecting Nafta. Drawing together the treaty, the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations and the APEC summit in Seattle later this
month, he said, 'these are 40 days that can shake the economic world and
shape America's future position in it'.
Last Tuesday's round of off-year elections, which saw the Democrats lose
three big races in New York, New Jersey and Virginia, might have stiffened
resistance to Nafta among the 50 plus Democrats still reckoned to be
undecided.
Nafta was not an issue in any of the contests but the results have been
freely interpreted as demonstrating that Mr Clinton's political coattails
are very short and that congressmen may be inclined to pay more attention to
local opinion against the agreement.
The White House also thinks Mr Perot's credibility is diminishing, a
conclusion borne out by public opinion polls. But last year's three
televised presidential debates showed how effective he could be with his
homespun arguments.
It was considered inappropriate for Mr Clinton himself to take Mr Perot on,
while fielding Mr Lee Iacocca, pugnacious former head of Chrysler and a
prominent pro-Nafta campaigner, might have resulted in verbal fireworks, but
too much on Mr Perot's terms.
Mr Gore, his many years in the Senate notwithstanding, is not a natural
television debater. His confrontation last year with then vice president Dan
Quayle showed him to be a bit stiff. But it is thought his dignity and
ability to marshal arguments and facts will stand up well against Mr Perot's
tendency to shoot wildly, if divertingly, from the hip.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Nafta vote raises Gatt deal hopes - US
decision means just half of the battle is won, says Sutherland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   GENEVA, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE officials urged yesterday that US congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement should be used to secure a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, praised President Bill Clinton's success, but noted that the
234-200 vote in the House of Representatives was 'just half of the battle
won'.
The priority would now necessarily turn to successful completion of the
Uruguay round.
'Nafta and similar enterprises - no less the European Union - cannot thrive
in isolation. They are not economically self-sustainable and must be part of
a broader world trading system under the aegis of the Gatt,' he said.
'The other half of the battle, making the Nafta a genuine positive force in
the world economy, must be the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.'
The Nafta vote cast a shadow over Gatt talks in recent weeks, tying US
negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing the round has been
perilously short, and difficult deadlock-breaking compromises have been
urgently needed.
Amid rising optimism that a long-elusive trade-liberalsing package is
finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high in Geneva that
the success of the Nafta vote would free top US and EU trade negotiators
meeting in Washington early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
Mr Sutherland's comments came during a briefing intended to underline trade
liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed in Uruguay
Round negotiations, and to focus on what is at risk if the small number of
outstanding differences result in failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said.
In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, welcomed the House
vote in favour of Nafta, saying it would remove a big distraction for the
Clinton administration and allow a final drive for agreement in Gatt talks.
However, Sir Leon sounded a note of caution, telling reporters that he
needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the White House may have
offered members of Congress to get their vote and how it might affect Gatt.
With only four weeks remaining to the December 15 deadline for a Gatt deal,
Sir Leon is due to hold talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, in Washington next week.
Meanwhile, France said it was now up to the US to produce 'new proposals' to
bring the Gatt negotiations to the same successful conclusion as the Nafta
accord.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's foreign trade minister, said the the Clinton
administration could and should henceforth 'devote itself fully to the
Uruguay Round'.
Mr Sutherland warned that 'if what is currently on the table is now lost,'
then 'the threat from unreconcilable disputes will be intense'.
Mr Gijs de Vries, a Dutch member of the European Parliament speaking for the
body's liberal group, hailed the Nafta vote as a 'victory for common sense'.
'The only 'sucking sound' Americans will hear is the sound of exports going
south,' he said, referring to Mr Ross Perot's oft-quoted description of
Americans losing their jobs to Mexico as a result of Nafta.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Traders nonplussed by trade vote - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE POLITICS of international trade can be devilishly complicated
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
just try explaining what GATT, the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all
about - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the
North American Free Trade Agreement: if Congress passes the treaty next
week, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the
stock markets, and good for President Clinton.
Their reasoning is quite simple. Investors believe that Nafta will lift
corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the
three signatory countries the US, with its superior industrial productivity
rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic
benefits. The expectation is that growth in US exports to Mexico and Canada
will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south.
Investors are not alone in their optimistic view of Nafta. Most Wall Street
economists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent
polls are to be believed.
There is, however, the dark side of Nafta to consider. What if Congress
votes no? Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous
knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the US, Latin
America and eventually Europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over
the Uruguay Round. By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote,
Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian
Pacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the
President's authority on trade issues will be compromised.
Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a
spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of
international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic
growth.
In this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. Many
economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating
collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global
inflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows,
which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets.
Thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher
inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are
already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock
valuations.
Then there is the political cost of Nafta's failure to consider. Although
the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he
has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through
Congress. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task,
because Congress is controlled by Democrats.
Yet, opposition to Nafta among Democratic legislators beholden to labour
interests is considerable. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up
trade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the
border, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market
remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans.
The result is that the President faces a tough fight ensuring that the House
of Representatives votes to approve the treaty on Wednesday.
As of yesterday, the outcome of the vote was deemed too close to call. Stock
markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for
Nafta improved this week. Share prices in Mexico rose on Wednesday and
Thursday, and US stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on
Tuesday between Vice-President Al Gore and Ross Perot, who is Nafta's most
celebrated opponent.
Gore clearly bested Perot in a heated war of words, and polls taken over the
next few days revealed that more Americans had been won over to Nafta.
Whether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the
Clinton administration's way remains to be seem.
Nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through
Congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. A week
ago bond yields jumped amid worries that resurgent economic growth might
rekindle inflation. Although data released this week on producer and
consumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now,
unjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.
Amid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets
next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night's
vote, which, like the battle over President Clinton's first budget, will be
extremely close.

Laureates and 284 economists versus Perot, Buchanan and Brown; it's your
choice'
 - Mickey Kantor, US trade representative
Barring the unforeseen, the latest addition to the matriarchy of all
political battles will be finally decided on November 17 when 258 Democrats,
175 Republicans, and one independent in the 435-member House of
Representatives (there is one vacant seat) vote on whether to approve the
North American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Mexico and Canada on
January 1. A simple majority of 218 is all that is needed. If it passes, the
Senate will almost certainly follow suit; if it fails, the upper chamber
does not have to act.
The stakes are enormous - for the political credibility of President Bill
Clinton early in his term and for the legacy of President Carlos Salinas as
he nears the end of his, for the evolution of the Mexican and US economies,
and for a global trading structure in which a Uruguay Round agreement
scheduled to be reached by December 15 may be unattainable if Nafta goes
down.
Conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war
now going on in pursuit of the 218-vote nirvana. More Republicans, perhaps
as many as 120 according to congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, far fewer
according to Mr Jim Jontz, a former congressman from Indiana, will vote for
than against, not least because the original Nafta was negotiated by the
Bush administration. This leaves Mr Clinton needing at most 40 per cent of
his own party to triumph - and therein lies the problem.
For the Democratic coalition that just - by one vote - sustained the
president in the great budget battle against unanimous Republican
opposition, is in tatters. In July it was the 'new' Democrats, especially
moderates from the south, who deserted Mr Clinton while the old liners -
labour, liberals, blacks - held their noses and held fast. On Nafta, the
positions are in good measure reversed.
According to Ms Lori Wallach, a leading co-ordinator of the 'anti-'
campaign, the 'no' camp already numbers 208-210 'including some leaners'.
Bill Daley, drafted from his Chicago domain to direct the 'yes' campaign,
disputes this estimate, counts about 195 in favour and says that some 55
Democrats are still undecided. Mr Jontz disagrees, reckoning there are now
more Republicans than Democrats on the fence. He thinks the freshman class -
66 Democrats and 48 Republicans - is particularly resistant to Nafta.
Both sides hail and blast each new convert. Democrat John Dingell of
Michigan came out for the 'noes' this week, but Mr Daley counters that he
could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different.
Ms Wallach is equally dismissive of the impact of the 'yes' declarations of
Democrats Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts and Esteban Torres from California.
The latter, she insists, probably could not carry the 18-member Hispanic
caucus.
The politics of Nafta have produced uneasy dalliances among political
heavyweights. In one bed lie the president, the Republican leadership,
including Newt Gingrich, a fervent conservative, the Senate majority leader,
the Speaker of the House, most leaders of big business, and some prominent
environmental groups: in the other can be found the House majority leader
(Richard Gephardt) and most of the Democratic House whips, including David
Bonior of Michigan, the chief anti-Nafta strategist, plus Ralph Nader, the
consumer advocate, most of the labour unions, Pat Buchanan, the right-wing
ideologue, and Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate.
Ms Wallach, who portrays the Nafta divide as one between 'populists and the
elites', says there is little top-level contact with Mr Perot, who first
spoke of the 'giant sucking sound' of US jobs going south to Mexico, but
that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses. Mr Daley
says that 'Perot's credibility is diminishing because he has become a
politician', an assessment borne out by several recent opinion polls.
Both sides agree that the role played by President Clinton himself is
crucial. 'He is my number one worry - never underestimate the power of the
presidency,' says Ms Wallach. He got off to a slow start. In the summer he
was consumed by the budget, and more recently distracted by healthcare,
Haiti and Somalia. Meanwhile the opposition was off and running early.
The administration pinned a lot of its midsummer hopes on Nafta's 'side
agreements', covering Mexican environmental and labour laws and guarding
against import 'surges', meeting most objections. But these were only
completed in mid-August, later than planned, and were only partly
successful. Six prominent US environmental groups came out in favour, but
union opposition became entrenched. Most important, Congressman Gephardt,
whose backing could probably have ensured passage, declared he was not
satisfied.
Mr Daley insists it does not matter that the president started late because
'in politics, decisions are only taken in the last few days'. Whatever the
merits of this argument, there is no questioning that the pro-Nafta campaign
is now in full swing, with plans that Mr Clinton himself do little other
than argue for the agreement in the next two weeks.
Every day brings a new media show. Last week saw Products Day on the White
House lawn, a display of 175 goods that would benefit from Nafta. Last
weekend the president went to Boston to maintain that JFK would have been
pro-Nafta. On Monday he appeared at an electronic 'town meeting' with
members of the American Chamber of Commerce. Later this week he is in
Louisville, Kentucky. On Sunday an hour-long TV interview is scheduled.
About twice a week he has 15-20 congressmen in his office for a Nafta
exhortation. He works the phones constantly, and all members of his cabinet
are fully engaged, sometimes inventively. Mr Kantor's latest pitch is that
Japan is against Nafta and would, along with Europe, seek to profit from its
defeat. The Nafta 'war room', operating out of the Old Executive Office
building next to the White House, co-ordinates it all and makes sure that
businessmen keep up the pressure on individual members.
Certain actions, both substantive and personal, get taken with Nafta in
view. Last week's creation of the North American Development Bank, with its
funds available for border clean-up, obviously helped Congressman Torres
come off the fence. At the other extreme, Congressman E Clay Shaw, a Florida
Republican, is demanding that the administration put pressure on Mexico for
the extradition of an accused rapist. Mr Daley says: 'We have made our views
known to the Mexican government on this, though they knew about it already.'
All this activity is matched with fervour and skill by the other side. Ms
Wallach claims to have kept a lid on vote switching. She points out that
Congressman Kweisi Mfume from Maryland, leader of the 38-strong black
Democratic caucus previously so loyal to Mr Clinton, is helping Mr Bonior
garner votes against Nafta, and that only one black congressman has come out
in favour. On broader policy issues, both camps were bombarding the media
with their respective spins after last week's Canadian election result.
'They've thrown everything at us, but it hasn't made a difference so far,'
she insists.
With two weeks to go, neither side will publicly admit the possibility of
defeat. Mr Daley says he will not sell the White House lawn, but seen
crossing it yesterday was a gaggle of living Nobel Laureates, including
Henry Kissinger, last seen being nice to Mr Clinton on Martha's Vineyard in
August. The grass seemed in place.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Nafta vote hailed as boost for Gatt: 'A long step in the
right direction,' says Clinton

TRADE officials said yesterday that US congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement should be used to secure a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, praised President Bill Clinton's success, but was quick to note
that the vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, by 234 to
200, was 'just half of the battle won'.
He said: 'Half the battle because Nafta and similar enterprises - no less
the European Union - cannot themselves thrive in isolation. They are not
economically self-sustainable and must be part of a broader world trading
system under the aegis of the Gatt.
'The other half of the battle, making the Nafta a genuine positive force in
the world economy, must be the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.'
Trade negotiators in Geneva have set a December 15 deadline for completion
of the round. The Nafta vote had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several
weeks, tying US negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing
the round has been perilously short.
Amid rising optimism that long-elusive trade-liberalising measures are
finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high that the
success of the Nafta vote would allow top US and EU trade negotiators
meeting in Washington early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
Mr Clinton, before flying to his Asian summit in Seattle, said the House
approval of Nafta was 'a long step in the right direction' of more open
markets and more vigorous international competition.
The vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make
its case with the Asian leaders and in the final push to conclude the
Uruguay Round.
The measure was passed by a far more comfortable margin than had appeared
likely even as the House debated the agreement.
Mr Sutherland's comments came during a Geneva briefing intended to underline
trade liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed, and to
focus on what is at risk if the few outstanding differences result in
failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said. 'The overall
picture is heartening, but there are still significant difficulties in
bringing the round to a conclusion.
'There is a lot there that should stimulate the participants with the
knowledge of how much they stand to lose.'
In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, also warmly welcomed
the House vote, saying it would remove a big distraction for the Clinton
administration and allow a final drive for agreement in the Gatt talks.
However, Sir Leon sounded one note of caution, telling reporters that he
needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the White House may have
offered members of Congress to get their vote and how it might affect Gatt.
With only four weeks remaining to deadline for a Gatt deal, Sir Leon is due
to hold talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington
next week.
A measure of concern exists that so much remains to be negotiated in the
Gatt talks, with so little time remaining. 'You have a feeling that each
side has spent half of its time calculating how to blame the other in the
event of a failure,' one Commission official said.

   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted
outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling
public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend.
The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al
Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot, hoped they had finally captured the
elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the House vote next
Wednesday. A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the
trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent
before the debate to 57 per cent after it.
Arthur Andersen &amp; Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and
business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives
of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support
Nafta.
Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr
Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious
response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate.
Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in
the US, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and
democratic rights. He said just 34 families owned half the country, and some
85m others lived in poverty.
The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political
parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments
expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack
and offend Mexicans. We condemn them as inadmissible and without
foundation.'
US opponents of Nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to
Mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact.
'The only thing that matters is the economy,' said Mr Christopher Whalen, a
Washington trade consultant.
'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for
Nafta will have to look for other employment next year.'
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, Congressman David
Bonior, an anti-Nafta whip, on Wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434
members pledged to vote against the pact. However, he needs at least 10-12
votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches, as the
Administration increases its pressure.
The Administration this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes, and
claims to have a total of 192. It is publishing a free 800 telephone number
with the offer to voters to send, free of charge, pro-Nafta telegrams to
their congressman.
Around the country, the opposition troops are planning rallies, marches,
town hall meetings and 'accountability meetings' with congressmen. Ms Lori
Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the
congressmen's home districts.
Washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend. The
anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol
to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a
reluctant Congress.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore up front and deals in the backrooms -
What turned the tide in the fight for Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOCIFEROUS opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement first
surfaced three years ago when a coalition of US labour, environmentalists,
consumer groups, farm and church organisations formed to oppose extension of
the 'fast track' authorisation, under which Congress agrees to vote on trade
pacts such as Nafta without amendment.
These groups comprise the worker bees of the Democratic party, so it was
with trepidation that the supporters of then Governor Bill Clinton watched
their candidate endorse Nafta during the primary and general election
campaigns last year.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman and now US trade representative,
said Mr Clinton immediately recognised that Nafta would not be 'politically
viable' - with either the electorate or the Congress later on - without the
side deals ultimately negotiated on labour, environment and unexpected
import surges.
The big business backers of the trade pact perceived that Nafta was in deep
trouble when, during the presidential debates, Mr Ross Perot, the
independent candidate, repeatedly raised the threat of a 'giant sucking
sound' drawing US factories south of the US-Mexico border. The phrase found
resonance in the steady drumbeat of corporate cutback announcements,
fuelling worker insecurity as the US economy restructures.
Organising against Nafta continued as negotiations over the supplemental
pacts dragged on for seven months. The administration was in a squeeze;
business, Mexico and Canada were resisting a strong deal guaranteeing the
right of Mexican workers to organise and strike. It was not clear that the
US unions would support any Nafta at all.
Just as Republicans and the business community were grumbling that President
Clinton did not have his heart in Nafta and Congress returned from its
summer recess alarmed about the pact's unpopularity, the White House put on
a spectacular launch ceremony. On the bill were President Clinton at his
most passionate (inexplicably, he is always his best on Nafta) and the
endorsements of former Presidents George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
all of which came to symbolise the extraordinary bi-partisanship which in
the end got Nafta through the House.
Thereafter, a succession of White House events, including Nafta endorsements
by practically every living former cabinet official and economist,
presidential trips and speeches, just barely moved public opinion on Nafta.
'Four weeks ago not one person, outside a few, thought we could pass this
Nafta,' Mr Kantor said.
The president was eating with, jogging with and pressuring congressmen, but
making little apparent headway until Vice President Al Gore suggested
debating Mr Perot.
It was a brilliant strategy, because it personalised Nafta in the form of an
arrogant, secretive and peculiar Texas billionaire. Mr Perot's televised
threats - and those of labour - that they would eject from office all Nafta
supporters in the House was a big miscalculation. It caused resentment among
congressmen and a determination by some not to be seen as being in labour's
pocket.
Implicitly acknowledging that backroom deals would be key to passage, the
administration brought in as 'Nafta czar' Mr William Daley, son of the late
Chicago mayor 'Boss' Richard Daley and brother of the current mayor. It was
a series of deals that Mr Daley was involved in and which were detailed in
presidential letters to congressmen, and a turnaround in public opinion
after the debate, which brought a flood of endorsements just before the vote
and clinched the 234-200 victory.

charts returns to the screen

MR ROSS PEROT, independent presidential candidate in the US last year, this
weekend accused the Clinton administration of using taxpayers' dollars to
promote the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Texan billionaire warned Americans that the pact with Canada and Mexico
would jeopardise their jobs.
In a paid television 'info-mercial', he made his case against Nafta with the
sort of pie charts and graphs he wielded during the presidential campaign,
and with film of Mexican slums.
Greedy factory owners would move south of the border to take advantage of a
minimum wage of 58 US cents (37 pence) an hour, Mr Perot said. The loss of
US jobs would make it impossible to balance the US budget.
'If you and I sit here complacently, it will create the giant sucking sound
I've been talking about,' he said of the job flight to Mexico. He urged
voters to write 'Nafta yes' or 'Nafta no' on a piece of paper and send it to
their Congressmen, the White House and him.
Mr Perot excoriated the 'lobbyists in the employ of foreign governments',
who he said had written the agreement. He signed off the half-hour broadcast
somewhat awkwardly, concluding, 'I love you'.
Supplements to the Nafta, signed last year for the US by the Bush
administration, are being negotiated by Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City.
After that, the accord would need approval by the US Congress.
The Clinton administration had sought, even before the Perot appearance, to
limit the damage with a show for the press - billed as 'a serious in-depth
discussion' - by three members of the cabinet. Although they came prepared
with their own visuals, to argue that jobs would be lost with or without a
Nafta, they inexplicably kept cameras out of the briefing room.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, used his graph to demonstrate how
exports to Mexico had soared in 1986-92, creating 425,000 relatively
well-paid US jobs in the process. Handling the popular Mr Perot gingerly, Mr
Kantor said the unpredictable billionaire had been 'misled' about the threat
of job losses. The Nafta would enhance the prospects of small and medium US
businesses which cannot penetrate Mexico's tariff walls.
'Opponents of this agreement are looking at the future through a rear-view
mirror,' he said.
When the presentation was taken up by Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the
council of economic advisers, the focus shifted from the impact of the Nafta
to the outcome if it were not to be enacted. Mexico's liberalisation 'could
easily be derailed', and many of the new jobs created could be lost, she
said. 'There's a great cost to not going forward.'
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said: 'Long term, America cannot compete
on the basis of low wages. The only way we can build up the American economy
is through a very different strategy premised on education, training,
infrastructure and resources in the private sector, to continue to invest in
America.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Battle for hearts and minds over Nafta -
Guerrilla tactics versus White House pomp and press machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp in
which Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearing
to unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and
again on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots
organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread
public hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico. A new Wall Street
Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest
level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.
The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff
announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration
with a formidable challenge. Fifty per cent of the Americans polled
disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created
than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that
US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the
opposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which
would cost jobs.
But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's
passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced;
President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a
demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of
Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country
would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given
no work at home.
'It was a revival,' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle. 'I think Nafta was
born again.'
To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday
took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out
on speaking tours across the country. Government agencies have been
mobilised for the battle, given pro-Nafta literature and instructed to boost
the pact in seminars and public forums.
Congressional committees have begun to examine the details in preparation
for writing its implementing legislation, now expected on the Hill in
November. It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional
doubters, who are demanding a 'level playing field' and a speedup of Mexican
tariff reductions.
Pro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning. A Greenpeace
release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be
undermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,
citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and
other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the
largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental
side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign,
one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk'
the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next
five years.
Unmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies:
anti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign
and more.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the House
Majority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to
committed opposition. He will join forces with Congressman David Bonior, the
majority whip, and three of Mr Bonior's lieutenants, leaving the House
Speaker, Tom Foley, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - the
very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting
this,' Mr Foley acknowledged.
Without Nafta, the US relationship with Mexico could 'deteriorate,' and
'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily
without Nafta than with it. Those things have to be presented more
forcefully.'

THE NEXT three weeks promise to be decisive for the future of global free
trade. Will the world's trading powers be able to proceed down the home
stretch towards an agreement in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade? Or will they have to brace themselves for an
escalation of bilateral trade conflicts that could poison international
relations and impair world economic growth? An initial answer may come on
November 17, when the US House of Representatives votes on whether to ratify
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and
Mexico.
Technically, the Nafta vote is quite separate from the wider Uruguay round
negotiations; in practice, the two are intimately connected. If President
Bill Clinton fails to prevail over Nafta's opponents - an alliance of trade
unionists, environmentalists and protectionists - he will be so weakened
that he will have little chance of gaining approval for the concessions
needed to secure a Gatt agreement. If he wins, he can choose to press ahead
with concluding the Uruguay round by the deadline of mid-December, when his
'fast-track' negotiating mandate expires.
The good news is that after months of hesitation Mr Clinton has finally come
out fighting for Nafta with a series of campaigning speeches for the
agreement and an increasingly sophisticated lobbying effort aimed at
congressional waverers. As a result it is beginning to look as if the
balance is tipping in his favour. Although Nafta could still be derailed by
the election of a new Canadian government, which claims to be committed to
renegotiating it, the US appears confident that Ottawa's ire is directed
more at its existing free-trade agreement with the US than at the new deal
which will supersede it.
Of course, Mr Clinton's efforts to secure Nafta come at a price. Sceptics in
Europe and elsewhere note that the US has lately taken a harder line over
the Gatt, withholding further tariff concessions, raising the stakes over
financial services with east Asian countries and refusing to mollify the
European Community over farm trade. They wonder whether Washington might,
having secured Nafta, be tempted to spurn the multilateral negotiations in
search of bilateral pacts with the Asian countries whose leaders Mr Clinton
is to meet in Seattle on November 19.
They should withhold judgment, at least for a time. Mr Clinton's current
negotiating posture may be more form than substance. There is no reason why
freer North American or Asian trade should do anything other than complement
America's commitment to the Uruguay round, while serving the useful purpose
of concentrating recalcitrant minds in the EC. It is in everyone's interest
that he secure Nafta. Then, if he is wise, he will decide it is in America's
interest to complete the new multilateral trading framework that the world
so badly needs.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Midwest speaks up for Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARM and manufacturing interests in the US midwest have grown weary of
holding their fire against foes of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Like business groups and public officials across the country, they believe
anti-Nafta forces, particularly labour unions and Mr Ross Perot, last year's
independent candidate for the presidency, need to be answered if the pact is
to be implemented next January on schedule.
In Illinois, the defence will be taken up by a coalition of 200 of the
state's largest companies, representing agriculture, manufacturing,
electronics, oil, steel and finance. The objective is to regenerate
political momentum for the pact.
In Washington, a business coalition, USA Nafta, has the same goal. It is
attracting support from across the country. The nation's governors,
particularly those in the west, are also coming out for the pact. According
to a survey by the heritage foundation, 40 of 50 governors strongly support
the agreement, with 10 undecided or not responding.
'If Nafta is to become a reality, the White House has to be behind it,' said
Mr Bill Lane, of Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker. He said the group
will work with the Illinois congressional delegation to create a pro-Nafta
force in Washington.
Illinois, with its farm and manufacturing base, has a lot at stake. Mexico
is its second largest foreign market, with exports of Dollars 16.5bn
annually.
Group members include drug maker Abbott Laboratories; electronics
manufacturer Motorola; the giant retailer, Sears; Amoco Oil; and a variety
of farm organisations and food companies. Caterpillar stands to gain Dollars
45m in additional sales under Nafta. In 1992 it sold Dollars 200m in engines
and equipment to Mexico.

political agenda

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL trade, above all Nafta, is an issue which has never quite
taken off in this year's long primary and presidential campaigns.
Yesterday's signing of the agreement threatens to change that, for the
moment at least.
President George Bush will be able to proclaim Nafta as another example of
his international statesmanship, conveniently obscuring the fact that his
administration has been unable to bring to pass a successful conclusion of
the broader Uruguay round of trade negotiations.
Coming on top of recent summits with the Russian and Israeli leaders and
with Middle East peace talks about to resume here, the image of a president
on top of foreign affairs can be presented to offset the lack of solutions
to what is happening in the Balkans and with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Yet the
biggest plus for Mr Bush may be in the extent to which Mr Bill Clinton, his
Democratic opponent for the presidency, is caught on a political hook on
which he can only wriggle.
Yesterday Mr Clinton issued statements almost identical to his last
pronouncement on Nafta two weeks ago. He reserved judgment on the treaty
itself, pending study of its details and whatever emerges from Congressional
hearings. But he repeated that he would support it 'so long as it provides
adequate protection for workers, farmers and the environment on both sides
of the border.' He added that 'we must have strong transition strategies
that ensure workers benefit from a more open world trading system.'
Mr Clinton has been trying to reduce the Democratic Party's dependence on
those of its constituent parts, such as organised labour, which have long
been associated with outright protectionism. To this end, he began his quest
for the White House by supporting the Nafta goals and the 'fast track'
approach to it, whereby Congress can only vote on the agreement, not amend
it.
The failure of Mr Clinton's Democratic opponents, and of Mr Patrick Buchanan
on the Republican side and Ross Perot, the defunct independent, proved
protectionism had only limited political appeal in the primaries. But as the
Nafta negotiations have moved to a climax, opposition to it, concentrated in
the Democratic Party, has become more focused and vocal.
In particular it has brought back to the fore Congressman Richard Gephardt
of Missouri, who ran for the Democratic nomination four years ago on a
blatantly protectionist platform. Some of Mr Gephardt's criticisms of Nafta
have reportedly been run past Mr Clinton.
Mr Clinton still felt free two weeks ago to condemn 'the outdated rhetoric
of both the free traders who are oblivious to workers and the environment
and the protectionists who ignore the benefits of expanded world trade.' He
associated Mr Gephardt with the same sentiments.
This is a fine line to walk and further qualification of his earlier stand
invites not only Republican attack. In a recent editorial entitled 'a test
of Mr Clinton's backbone,' the New York Times wrote that he 'will have to
choose between the protectionist policies of old and his own campaign
promises.'
In theory Mr Clinton can wait, since Congress will not vote on Nafta until
next year. He may try to confine himself to promising to change what he does
not like if he becomes president. His opposition and the media are unlikely
to allow him that luxury.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas'
supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The site of the signing ceremony in
Sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one of
the leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives.
In Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner
given for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. These featured
the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes
a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US.
Anti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through Tennessee, California and Texas
to mobilise opposition. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised
from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation
in Mexico.
With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds
134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount
a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
Nafta's US proponents - mostly the business community - are spending
millions, bypassing the voters, to convince Congress to pass Nafta.
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week showed 31 per cent of all
Americans in favour of the pact, a slight increase from previous surveys,
while 29 per cent are opposed. However, 63 per cent believe Nafta will cost
US jobs.
Although the Clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'Nafta
czar' to shepherd the pact through Congress, it has yet to announce it has
found anyone to take on the task. By contrast, the opposition has an
'anti-Nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country.
He is Mr Jim Jontz, a former Indiana congressman. Nafta foes have pooled
their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field
legislative directors. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two
weeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.
Nafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman
to back away from support of the deal. One California gubernatorial hopeful,
Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked
by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
According to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California's Fair Trade
Campaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest
of the state's Democratic establishment.
With the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on
labour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying
efforts.
The opposition is not awaiting an announcement of the details, said Ms Lori
Wallach, one of the opposition's leaders. The side pacts will be 'silly,'
she said, 'It's the same old Bush Nafta with the supplementals used to
create a fig-leaf.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nafta passage in peril
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK President Bill Clinton launched his campaign for ratification of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), with a finely choreographed
event involving three ex-presidents and a speech that rose magnificently to
the occasion. Here was a Democratic president, leader of the party within
which most resistance to the agreement can be found, setting out firmly and
clearly the reasons why that resistance is so utterly wrong-headed. At last,
one felt listening to him, the administration is going to give this issue
the priority it needs.
Yet by the end of the week the presidential propaganda machine had already
moved on to beat the drums for healthcare reform. That is an important
issue, but unlikely to reach decision point before mid-1994 at the earliest.
By contrast a decision on Nafta is needed by the end of this year, and as
things stand the decision is more than likely to go against it. One speech
is certainly not enough to undo the damage done by Mr Ross Perot in whipping
up hysteria on the issue.
Precious time was lost between Mr Clinton's inauguration last January and
the signing in mid-August of 'side agreements' on labour and the
environment, which he had promised to secure during his election campaign.
From a strict free trade point of view, these agreements actually reduce the
attraction of Nafta, since they forbid further unilateral deregulation in
these areas by any of the three signatories (Canada, Mexico and the US).
Worrying parallels
The object of the side agreements is, of course, to pacify powerful lobbies
in the US, whose anxieties Mr Clinton shares or at least claims to share.
The exercise is similar to the 'clarification' of the Blair House agreement
on agricultural trade, which the EC has now agreed to seek in order to save
the French government from the wrath of its farm lobby. Indeed there is a
worrying parallelism between the US attitude to Nafta and the French
attitude to Blair House: both have come to be seen as symbolising all the
demons that threaten national living standards and a cherished way of life,
although in both cases the likely economic effect is quite small.
It would be helpful if all discussion of Nafta in the US began with a
reminder that the whole Mexican economy is no bigger than the amount by
which the US economy grows in two average years, and then proceeded to point
out that US imports from Mexico are already virtually unrestricted. The next
point to note is that, even without Nafta, deregulation in Mexico has
already turned a US deficit on bilateral trade of Dollars 5.7bn in 1987 into
a Dollars 5.6bn US surplus in 1992. The 'giant sucking sound' of jobs moving
south, with which Mr Perot has terrorised American workers, should be
drowned, in any rational universe, by the noise of new factories being built
in the US to supply the Mexican market.
Strategic centrepiece
Nafta is not a zero-sum game. It should result in a net increase in
employment on both sides of the Rio Grande (and indeed of the 49th
parallel). But, while the short-term gains might well be greater in the US,
the agreement's political importance to Mexico can hardly be exaggerated.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made Nafta the centrepiece of his
liberalising strategy, which reverses all 20th-century Mexican traditions
and is still bitterly contested both outside and (more discreetly but also
more dangerously) inside the ruling party. US rejection is likely to derail
this strategy. That should be a matter of acute concern to Americans, right
across the political spectrum. The last thing the US needs is a southern
neighbour sinking back into economic stagnation and political instability,
from which ever growing numbers would flee northward.
Republican congressmen and senators should not let partisan feeling, or
dislike of the side agreements, dissuade them from voting for an agreement
which remains a great achievement of their party. Mr Clinton, for his part,
must not fall into the trap of thinking that, having at last made his own
position clear, he can now afford to move on to other issues. This one
requires all his persuasive powers, and if it goes wrong it will be a sad
victory for the forces of irrationalism, leaving little hope that the US
will grasp the more difficult nettles of freer trade with Europe and Asia.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: No 'slam dunk' shot for Gatt in Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has officially informed Congress of his intention to
sign a Uruguay Round package, but he repeated past vows not to 'enter any
agreement unless I am satisfied that US interests are protected'.
While praising the overall package, he said negotiations would continue to
work on 'a few areas of significance that we were unable to resolve at this
time'. This includes financial services, audio-visual trade and market
access.
'Some commitments were contingent on receiving satisfactory commitments from
other countries,' he said in a speech on Wedenesday night. 'We will continue
to work to ensure that the best possible agreement.'
Gatt - not to mention the newly named World Trade Organisation - is as
obscure as ever to most Americans; it is not likely to inspire the level of
passion achieved in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Congressional approval of the trade deal could be many months off, and might
even slip into 1995. Mr Clinton has 90 days in which to sign approval of the
package, then a further 90 legislative days before sending the implementing
legislation to Congress, already facing a packed agenda next year.
The long delay will allow both pro- and anti-Gatt forces, still trying to
disentangle the detail of the deal, plenty of time to muster arguments and
lobby congressmen.
Most of the business community in Washington yesterday was reacting
positively to the agreement. The chemical industry, however bemoaned the
failure of many countries to agree to tariff cuts.
'Our support for tariff reductions down to the 5-6 per cent range was
conditioned upon obtaining major country coverage in the round and the
elimination of non-tariff measures,' it said. 'If the developing countries
aren't on board, then the US must reserve the right to make adjustments to
its offer. . . to keep pressure on the developing countries to participate.
'We've been told this is possible, and urge it as a strategy of last
resort.'
Other industries have not achieved their objectives. However, it is by no
means clear they will strongly oppose it.
The main opposition that is surfacing is built around the core of populists
which fought the North American Free Trade Agreement. The followers of Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, may join in, but the trade unions may
split, depending on the gains achieved by their industries.
Congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, one of the cannier leaders of the Nafta
fight, believes it will not be 'a slam dunk', or easy shot, to get Gatt
approved by Congress.
Mr Kolbe was disappointed that the Japanese held firm against reducing their
tariffs on copper, a major commodity in the state. But he will still support
the deal.
'The issues in the Nafta were clear cut,' he said. 'This will be much
cloudier. There will be an attempt to pick off individual members by
different interest groups.
'Some agriculture people will oppose it and we could lose the
pharmaceuticals.' The environmentalists, who are beginning to appear to be
solidly against the pact, have exhausted their influence in the Nafta
battle.
Mr Abraham Katz, a former US ambassador to the OECD and president of the US
Council for International Business, says the members of his groups -
multinationals and service providers - will support the pact. It is
inevitable industry will be less united on Gatt than on Nafta, because many
had aims diametrically opposed. Exporters wanted the US dumping laws
weakened; domestic industry wanted them preserved. 'Every one of these
issues was a matter of balancing,' Mr Katz said.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Gore fights for Nafta as Congress vote nears: Perot attacks
trade pact in ill-tempered TV clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US vice-president Al Gore said early today that the North American Free
Trade Agreement would create 'hundreds of thousands' of jobs in the US but
if it did not work the pact could be ended by giving six months' notice.
Mr Gore strongly defended the Nafta pact with Mexico and Canada during a TV
debate, marked by testy exchanges, with Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire
who ran as an independent candidate in last year's presidential elections.
Mr Perot is one of the most strident opponents of the free trade pact, which
faces a crucial vote in the House of Representatives next Wednesday.
Answering Mr Perot's charges that jobs would be lost to Mexico, Mr Gore said
that 22 out of 23 studies had shown that Nafta would create more jobs in the
US. 'We know this works. If it doesn't work, we give six months notice and
we are out of it,' Mr Gore said.
President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration is pushing hard for
congressional endorsement of Nafta, which would create a free-trade zone of
more than 370m people. Mr Clinton negotiated environmental and labour
protection safeguards to add to the basic pact negotiated by his Republican
predecessor, Mr George Bush.
But even so, labour unions and environmentalists fear the pact will shift US
jobs abroad and cause ecological damage, especially in border regions.
The TV confrontation was marked by frequent interruptions and sharp attacks
by each participant on the other's personal integrity. Mr Gore said that
opponents of the Nafta were confusing 'the bad trade deals in the past with
this one, which is the first time we've been able to get one that's even
steven.'
Mr Perot retorted by arguing for a 'social tariff' to be imposed on Mexican
goods because of the much lower standard of living of Mexican workers.
'Livestock in this country and animals have a better life than good decent
Mexican workers,' the acerbic millionaire said.
The administration's efforts to build support for Nafta ahead of the House
vote appeared to be bearing fruit yesterday as half a dozen wavering
Democrats announced their support for the pact.
In a further move, the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax and
trade legislation, passed the bill implementing the trade agreement by a
surprisingly wide margin of 25-12.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Mexico 'spending Dollars 30m' to boost
Nafta in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is to spend as much as Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.4m) on lobbying efforts
by the end of this year, to try to ensure the passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, according to the Centre for Public Integrity in
Washington.
'Mexico has employed a veritable phalanx of Washington law firms, lobbyists,
public relations companies and consultants,' said Mr Charles Lewis,
executive director of the Centre, which draws about 10 per cent of its
support from labour unions.
Basing its conclusions on an eight-month analysis of Justice Department
records, researchers found that 33 former US officials had been hired by
Mexico to try to ensure the implementing legislation for Nafta gets
congressional approval. Among those working for Mexico are former US trade
representative Bill Brock and former analyst for the International Trade
Commission Ruth Kurtz.
The report is the latest snag in the Clinton administration's efforts to
sell Nafta to Congress.
Negotiations among the three governments on labour and environmental
supplemental agreements are now stalled over a US proposal to allow trade
sanctions against companies which demonstrate a pattern of failure to
enforce environmental laws. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, said this week he still expected to complete negotiations
this summer.
The most serious threat to Nafta may come from Mr Ross Perot, the former
presidential candidate, whose 'infomercial' against the accord is due to run
nationwide on television on Sunday night. Mr Perot's folksy presentations
have done much to arouse fear that Nafta will draw jobs from the US to
Mexico.
While many Democrats are in open rebellion against Nafta, Republican
senators and some business groups are threatening to oppose it if the
president succeeds in negotiating strong side agreements.
Union leaders, meanwhile, have given no sign that they will be satisfied by
the proposed tripartite commission on labour standards, which the side pact
would establish.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a
North American Free Trade Agreement.
'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of
the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good
paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The ceremony - for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge
side agreements - began with a spine-tingling entrance of Presidents
Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the
Chief.
Vice President Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta.
He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war. . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the Middle East.'
Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta
debate in a way that has been wholly lacking before as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
Workers have become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is behind most of the
opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in a time of change,
the only way to recover your security is to broaden your horizons and to
adapt to the change. . .
'If we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of
the governments of eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot
resist the winds of change,' he said.
Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Jimmy Carter to
take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a
demagogue. . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.

protesters trying to influence the vote on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate
opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.
A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the
college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.
Only 115 demonstrators turned out amid the autumn foliage in the grounds of
Virginia's capitol in Richmond.
They came promptly at two in the afternoon and by three most were gone. The
organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering
congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be
'remembered in November'. That is, next November's mid-term elections, when
those assembled - mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot
and union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office.
'We are absolutely for free trade,' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director
of Mr Perot's United We Stand. 'But Nafta undermines our constitution. It
puts decision-making in the hands of international panels, which undermines
our judicial system.' He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia's
tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous
downward pressure on wages.
'The administration is selling everything it can to every congressman it
can. That's wrong,' he says.
Mr Josh Greenwood, owner of a small hydroelectric company, says: 'I might
run against my congressman myself.'
Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims. 'In Virginia there was
slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued
them. They had better housing and better sanitary conditions than the
workers in Mexico today. The babies of the slaves weren't born with brain
damage from concentrated pollution.'
Virginia has 11 congressmen. Three have joined the anti-Nafta forces; five
have declared themselves in favour of the pact. The three undecided have
found themselves in the eye of a lobbying whirlwind.
Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from
both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says
his press secretary. As a member of the House armed services committee he
expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily
in his decision.
This argument carried little weight at Saturday's rally. Mr Ralph Dombrower,
a Perot devotee, brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing
a growing isolationism among American voters.
'The public is becoming less inclined to see the US as arbiter of worldwide
human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,'
he says.
The Virginia business community began a pro-Nafta lobbying effort last
March. 'The unions had gotten to everyone. We were going against a tide of
misinformation,' says Ms Kathy Otts, co-captain of Virginians For Nafta.
The coalition - 100 of the state's largest businesses and 500 small and
medium-sized companies - counter-attacked with an 'education' campaign.
Company employees were exhorted to write or call their congressman.
The anti-Nafta forces on Saturday published long lists of business
contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. 'Constituents only have votes to
give, and it seems these congressmen are having a hard time hearing their
message,' the cover page said.
On Friday, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a
dispirited Lorrie Beckwith, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had
been hindered early on by a lack of unity. President Bill Clinton seemed to
be buying off the undecided congressmen. One was reported to have been
promised that a manufacturing research centre would be located in his
district. Another was said to have received assurances of funding for a new
aircraft carrier to be built in his district. A visit to Congressman Sisisky
had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith.
'He says he had a bad feeling about the agreement in his gut. He was
concerned it may hurt family farms. But if he is offered a decent project,
he says he might find it tough to say no.'
In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen
Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend. His door bears a
sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of
Virginia'.
The unionised port workers are urging opposition. The military, which
comprises most of the district's voters, are worried about jobs in the face
of Pentagon cutbacks. 'He will listen to everyone's side,' a Pickett aide
says.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mexico offers a soft target - Nafta
critics accuse country of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton today begins a formal campaign to win congressional
approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mexico is a
problem.
The president has the backing of ex-US presidents and support from 280 US
economists, including 12 US Nobel laureates. However, silencing critics of
the pact, who say the US has no business integrating its market with a
non-democratic country guilty of corruption and human rights abuses, is
going to be difficult.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Mr Robert Reich, labour
secretary, and Ms Carol Browner, head of the environmental protection
agency, will all bring their persuasive skills before the House ways and
means committee to argue that the pact will create more jobs than it will
cost.
But the administration's efforts, now supported by pro-Nafta television
commercials funded by private-sector backers, have yet to address increasing
scrutiny of Mexico's political system.
'There is a lot of unease that the side agreements (on the environment and
labour) don't address the corruption issue and the chronic abuse of labour
rights and environmental standards,' said Mr John Cavanagh, a fellow with
the anti-Nafta Institute for Policy Studies. 'In the end the side agreements
have very weak enforcement powers.'
Mr Ross Perot is also exploiting the administration's vulnerability on the
corruption issue. The former presidential candidate has hit the air waves
with a scathing attack on the multi-million-dollar pro-Nafta lobby and the
'hired guns' - former US officials - working for a foreign government.
Mexico's one-party rule has been referred to on several occasions by Senator
Pat Moynihan of New York, chairman of the key Senate finance committee who
seems at best an unenthusiastic Nafta backer. Meanwhile, anti-Nafta forces,
led by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee,
are proposing a Nafta alternative: a common market which would require Latin
American countries to embrace democratic reforms before they could join.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, has not
taken a public position on the pact, but last week he held hearings which
featured testimony about drugs and corruption in the Mexican financial
sector. Mr R Christopher Whalen, a former official in the New York Federal
Reserve, warned of the lack of legal protection for private property and
contracts in Mexico.
The US unions are so hostile to the labour side agreement, which was meant
to pacify them, that the administration fears resources they have reserved
for healthcare reform will be diverted into the anti-Nafta cause.
'Mexican workers cannot defend their own economic interests,' says the
labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'Trade unions independent of
government control are discouraged. The Mexican government intimidates union
leaders and workers who do not toe the government line.'
Nafta opponents are also working closely with anti-government forces in
Mexico. Mr Carlos Heredia, a visiting fellow at the Development Gap, a
progressive policy group, is in Washington for a year because 'I want it to
be known that a pro-democracy movement - opposed to Nafta - exists in
Mexico'. He and others believe Nafta will reinforce the current political
system.
Pro-Nafta forces are left to link free trade, prosperity and democracy. Mr
Harry Freeman, a business lobbyist, says: 'Isolation is not the way to prod
Mexico into democracy and get rid of corruption. There is a higher
probability things will improve with Nafta than without it.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (5): Vote deadline is November 17 - Nancy
Dunne explains the US procedures for approving Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North American Free Trade Agreement, the most controversial US trade
agreement since the second world war, has now entered the shadowy world of
the Congressional fast track where legislative procedures are turned on
their heads, a bill is not a bill, a conference not a conference, and
legislation to implement trade agreements is born.
The fast-track procedure mandates an up or down vote on the 'implementing
legislation', thus evading deal-killing amendments designed to benefit
special interests. Unlike a treaty, which requires a two-thirds senate vote
for passage, fast track gives the responsibility of approval to a majority
in both houses.
The only hope for getting a trade pact through Congress without amendments
is to ensure a majority vote in advance.
This is achieved through a pre-approval negotiating process between the
administration and the Congress. Representatives of both essentially write
the implementing legislation together.
Work on the 'non-bill' that will become the implementing legislation begins
first in committees - the House Ways and Means Committees and the Senate
Finance - which have primary jurisdiction over trade. Other committees with
jurisdiction - like banking and agriculture - will also hold hearings.
After holding hearings, Ways and Means and Finance each write a 'non-bill',
in consultation with the administration and other committees. This process,
ordinarily called a 'markup', to produce bills, is called a 'mock up'.
The 'non-bill' makes changes in current law necessary for the implementation
of trade agreements, provides for financing mechanisms and changes tariffs.
It could also include the administration's interpretation of unclear
portions of the trade pact. Other trade legislation can be attached.
There is talk about adding a 'Super 301' provision to the Nafta in order to
attract wavering Democrats. Super 301 requires the administration to
negotiate away foreign trade barriers (or use sanctions if the trading
partners baulk).
The committees take their non-bills to a House-Senate 'mock conference'
where they iron out their differences and most of the changes are made. Mr
Richard Daley, the administration's 'Nafta czar', will be hard at work,
making backroom deals in exchange for member votes.
The result then goes to the president, who has a free hand with the
'non-bill'. He can tear it up, alter it, or submit it to Congress for
fast-track action, at which point it becomes a bill.
The bill can no longer be changed. It must be voted on in no fewer than 90
legislative days (days in session). The House committees have 45 days to
debate its merits before it moves on to full House debate for 15 days. If it
loses here - which may well happen - that is the end of the process.
If it passes, it goes on to the Senate, where the committees have 15 days to
debate and vote and the full Senate has 15 days. Both houses must schedule
20 hours of floor debate.
The president has asked Congressional leaders to accelerate the process in
order to get a Nafta into effect on January 1, as scheduled. Mr Tom Foley,
the House speaker and Nafta supporter, has scheduled a floor vote for
November 17.
There is considerable speculation about whether or not the vote will go
forward on schedule. The White House and Congressional leadership have vowed
that it will. A senior Senate aide said that the administration wants to get
the issue 'over and done with' to make way for more popular issues such as
health care and crime legislation. 'Members don't want to go home and talk
about it any more,' he said. 'The administration won't pick up votes by
waiting.'
Others say the administration has been forced to take a tough line on the
Nafta schedule to stem the flow of defecting Republicans and Democrats, who
are afraid a pro-Nafta vote will hurt them in their districts. They will not
want to support the bill if they think the president might delay it or pull
it for re-negotiation.
But will the leadership act if a Nafta loss seems probable? November 17 is
less than a month before the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round.
There is concern that a failure of Nafta in US Congress would discourage
politically-risky concessions in the Gatt talks, particularly if as
expected, Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, comes out in opposition to
the Gatt and promises to fund a fight against its passage.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Trade accords 'will benefit US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATIFICATION of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay
Round of talks on trade liberalisation would bring substantial cumulative
benefits to the US economy, a survey of 35 economic forecasters concluded
this week.
It says that ratification of the Nafta, over the next 15 years, would raise
the real level of the US gross domestic product by 3 per cent. A successful
Gatt deal would add a further 4 per cent over the same period.
Conducted by the London-based Consensus Economics, the survey nevertheless
reflected considerable uncertainty about success either in next week's Nafta
vote in the US Congress, or in meeting the December 15 deadline for
completion of the Uruguay Round.
The US forecasters gave a 57 per cent chance that Congress would ratify the
Nafta, but assigned a bare 51 per cent chance of the Uruguay Round being
successfully completed.
The findings coincide with signs in the US of a swing in public opinion
behind the Nafta.
Public support for the pact has leapt from 34 per cent to 57 per cent in the
wake of a nationwide televised debate this week between Vice President Al
Gore, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is a leading Nafta
opponent.
The Consensus Economics survey points to Nafta providing a Dollars 4.5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) boost to US exports in the first year after ratification,
rising to an annual Dollars 13.2bn by the year 2005.
Gains from a successful Uruguay round outcome would be even more marked,
boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than Dollars 24bn by
2005.
US imports would rise, but less markedly.
The forecasters see the agreements trimming inflationary pressures, slowing
the rise in employment costs, and generating a 'small net increase' in jobs.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore scores but game is still in doubt -
The TV clash with Perot over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUNDITS and pollsters alike declared Vice-President Al Gore the clear winner
in Tuesday night's televised debate with Mr Ross Perot about the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Unlike an election debate, however, this confrontation could hope to
influence fewer than a hundred members of Congress who remain uncommitted
either for or against Nafta. The debate's impact on ordinary viewers - a
pool already diminished because the debate reached only homes with cable
television - will be felt only indirectly in the crucial vote in the House
of Representatives next Wednesday.
Mr Gore may have attained a number of his objectives. The forum gave him the
opportunity to present the case for the treaty to a sceptical public, made
fearful by the slow recovery and corporate cutbacks. The vice-president
underlined the foreign and trade policy initiatives at stake and the danger
that the administration might be unable to overcome a Nafta defeat to
complete the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
However, he also presented a somewhat negative case for the agreement: he
repeatedly noted that the US could withdraw with only six months' notice if
the pact did not work, and warned that 'the Gatt round would probably not be
completed if Nafta were defeated'.
While the vice-president did not manage to provoke Mr Perot into any
stunning displays of paranoia, by constant needling he succeeded in making
his opponent appear nasty and thin-skinned. (Only on Sunday Mr Perot told a
rally that he had been warned by the FBI of a plot against his life by six
armed Cubans.)
The perception that Mr Perot may be more of a drawback than an advantage to
the Nafta opposition appears to be shared by several leading opponents of
the treaty, both inside and outside the Congress. The tone of Mr Perot's
arguments was so unremittingly negative and defensive that he actually
served up an excuse for any congressman still in search of a reason to vote
in favour in next week's Nafta debate.
The administration's calculated gamble, that identifying the anti-Nafta camp
closely with Mr Perot would work in favour of the agreement, appears to have
paid off, at least to some modest degree.
It still needs a political miracle to get Nafta through the House of
Representatives. The hope was that the debate would create a momentum
towards passage of the treaty that the administration has been unable to
achieve after weeks of deal-making.
Indeed, in its wake, one congressman, Mr Jim Bacchus of Florida, announced
his support, but he had been leaning towards a yes vote and the
administration has to secure 25-35 more.
It was useful to the pro-Nafta side that an hour after the debate was over
Mr Gore was quickly declared the winner in an ABC telephone poll by 47 per
cent of viewers compared with 33 per cent for Mr Perot. But the real gains
come in the televised soundbites - like the one in which Mr Perot calls the
vice-president a liar - and follow-up reporting.
Mr Al Hunt, former Wall Street Journal bureau chief, yesterday accused Mr
Perot of lying when he claimed to have never hired lobbyists. Mr Hunt said
Mr Perot had secretly lobbied the Ways and Means committee and had 'snuck
through' a Dollars 15m tax break for himself 'in the middle of the night'.
It was one more attack on Mr Perot's credibility, begun when the
vice-president pointed out that the Texan had supported Nafta before running
for president. Mr Gore held up a brochure featuring Mr Perot's picture and
extolling the benefits to be derived from Latin American trade for the Perot
family Alliance airport project in Fort Worth, Texas.
Mr Perot scored a number of debating points with his visual aids. One
featured a modern US company factory in Mexico surrounded by slums which
have sprung up for the workers. Mr Gore could have made the point more
effectively that, without Nafta, working and environmental conditions will
just worsen.
Ironically, Mr Perot often sounded as though he were more interested in
protecting the living standards of Mexican workers than those of their US
counterparts, and argued, with apparent seriousness, for a 'social tariff'
to force the Mexican government and elites to raise wages.
The sheer fact that the debate took place reflects the administration's need
to play catch-up in a race that is almost won by Nafta's opponents. The best
opportunity for winning support for the agreement was during the
negotiations on the side accords on environment and labour. But those
accords were not strong enough to win over influential members like
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the majority leader. Instead, the
administration is caught up in nerve-wracking last minute efforts which seem
only Sisyphean.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: White House gathers up endorsements for
Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOVING with all deliberate speed and flashes of passion and anger, the US
House of Representatives yesterday approached its climactic vote on the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue emotion of a different sort - barely
suppressed elation - was evident as the White House totted up the steady
stream of new endorsements for Nafta and calculated, though it would not
admit it publicly, that it would win.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was among those convinced that
the administration's application of maximum political force was on the edge
of producing a great victory for President Bill Clinton. Anything bigger
than a margin of one would be 'academic,' said Mr Bill Daley, the White
House's Nafta co-ordinator.
An evening Associated Press count suggested that the agreement had secured
support from 10 more members than the 218 needed for passage, though some
may be released from their promises once the magic number had been passed.
Significantly, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the Democrat from Ohio and a
leading Nafta opponent, conceded that she thought President Clinton would
carry the day, mostly, she added with scorn, on the back of support from the
Republican party.
The President went running in a pro-Nafta teeshirt and said 'it's never in
the bag until the vote's in.' He had despatched officials by the dozen to
Capitol Hill to keep up the pressure, as had the anti-Nafta forces. Mr Ross
Perot, the Texas populist, was behaving exactly like the lobbyists he
constantly condemns as he toured the halls exhorting members to vote
against.
In the House itself, the debate was briefly interrupted by anti-Nafta
demostrators shouting that Mr Clinton was bribing his way to victory and
throwing fake Dollars 50 bills on to the floor. Earlier Mr David Bonior, the
Michigan Democrat and chief anti-Nafta strategist, had opened the debate by
proclaiming 'its Nafta Claus time at the White House.'
'Its Dollars 50bn in goodies and give-aways,' shouted Mr Gerald Solomon, the
New York Republican.
Mr Solomon was at his most abrasive, which is saying something. He charged
that Nafta established an 'unelected, unaccountable bureacracy' that would
undermine the US constitution. But his assault on everything Mexican,
especially its '64-year-old one party dictatorship' of a government, was too
much for the venerable Kika de la Garza, the Democrat from Texas who rules
the House agriculture committee.
'I share blood with the Mexican people,' he barked back, 'and I resent the
xenophobia I've been hearing on this floor.' Reaching back into the last
century, he turned on Mr Solomon and others who had spoken in the same vein.
'They want a Mexican government run by the US, but let me remind you, we
tried that and it didn't work.'
Perhaps unconsciously, George Miller, the California Democrat, evoked
memories of Harold MacMillan's words condemning the Thatcher government's
attitudes to the British miners 'who had helped defeat the Nazis.' The
American worker, Mr Miller declared, 'had helped win the cold War and now
are not even being given an afterthought.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton gets tips on fine-tuning Nafta -
An influential report offers policy signposts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGGRESSIVE enforcement of national labour laws in Mexico and a Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2.1bn) environmental clean-up fund are called for in an assessment
of the North American Free Trade Agreement released yesterday by the
influential Washington-based Institute for International Economics.
The recommendations address fierce criticism of Nafta, particularly from US
labour and environmental interests which have been lobbying the Clinton
administration for amendments to the regional trade agreement.
Nafta was signed late last year by President George Bush, Mexico's President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister.
It is to be put to Congress for ratification later this year.
President Bill Clinton has committed the new administration to amendments to
the text, taking account of these pressures.
The IIE assessment - giving an overall B+ grade to the 2,000-page agreement
 -is intended to provide signposts to the policies he could adopt. It gives
clear support for the administration's call for supplementary agreements to
Nafta on labour and the environment, and recommends a Dollars 3bn 'Nafta
fund' in preference to a proposal from Democratic senator Max Baucus for a
special Nafta transaction tax.
The Nafta fund would finance the environmental clean-up on the US-Mexican
border and would help to underwrite work by the Environmental Protection
Commission, already suggested by Mr Clinton, in sponsoring broad assessments
of environmental conditions in each country. The IIE calls on the three
Nafta signatories to earmark for the fund Dollars 300m a year each for five
years, from 1994.
The Environmental Commission should also set up procedures to encourage
harmonisation of environmental standards, and set fines, or 'green fees',
for countries distorting trade inside the region because of poor
environmental standards.
The study predicts that Nafta would create a net 171,000 new jobs in the US,
with US surpluses in its trade with Mexico varying between Dollars 7bn and
Dollars 9bn a year up to 1995.
'Ross Perot got it wrong,' said Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the IIE.
'There has been a huge sucking sound, as Perot described, but it has been
due to US exports and the creation of American jobs.' Mr Perot last year
predicted Nafta would create the 'sucking sound' of US jobs lost to Mexico.
Mr Bergsten noted a Dollars 13bn swing in favour of the US in trade with
Mexico since 1989, a shift which he estimates has already created
200,000-300,000 jobs in the US.
While 316,000 jobs would be created by Nafta, the IIE report forecasts that
145,000 jobs would be 'dislocated' - a bare 2 per cent of the 8.9m jobs lost
in the US in the five years to 1990 because of plant closures, bankruptcies
and lay-offs. It calls for Dollars 335m a year to be spent from existing
tariff revenues for adjustment programmes linked with Nafta job losses, but
calls for this to be part of a wider national worker training programme.
Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott, the authors of the report, recommend
new negotiations to establish Mexican commitment to 'aggressive enforcement
of national labour laws and regulations'. They call for a trinational
commission to enforce labour standards, and authorise sanctions if
governments fail to halt abuses.
However, they insist the ultimate value of Nafta is in its boost to the
competitiveness of regional industries, rather than in job creation.
'Efficiency benefits and growth stimulus could exceed Dollars 15bn annually.
This figure, rather than jobs gained or lost, is the true measure of the
economic gain from the Nafta agreement,' which they see as one aspect of a
wider US strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and productivity.
The assessment confirms, but is more optimistic than, the findings of a
study just released by the US International Trade Commission on the
potential impact of Nafta.
This predicts the trade pact would provide a lift of up to 0.5 per cent of
real GNP in Canada and the US, with a potential increase of 11.4 per cent in
Mexico.
The ITC says US exports to Mexico could be boosted from 5.2 per cent to 27
per cent by the agreement, with Mexico's exports to the US jumping by
between 3.4 per cent and 15 per cent. It predicts aggregate employment gains
in the US of 'less than 1 per cent' of a workforce that currently totals
117m.
The commission says industries which will see greatest benefit will be
machine tools, bearings, industrial machinery, steel mill products,
pharmaceuticals, textiles, grains and oilseeds, cotton, wood products and
motor parts. Industries likely to suffer will be the motor industry,
garments, flat glass, glassware, household appliances, shrimps, peanuts, and
vegetables.
It points to 'an almost discernible effect on US wage rates for both
low-skilled and high-skilled workers' - a conclusion shared by the IIE
study.
The studies coincide with signals from labour groups that they may be poised
to moderate claims that Nafta will be a catastrophe for workers and
consumers.
As leaders of the influential AFL-CIO trade union grouping held their first
executive council meeting since the presidential election, they hinted that
US workers must come to terms with closer integration in Mexico, pressing
for higher minimum wages in Mexico instead of opposing Nafta itself.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Declining US surplus fuels Nafta debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE declining US trade surplus with Mexico has become a significant element
of the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US,
Mexico and Canada.
Last year the US manufacturing trade surplus to Mexico rose to Dollars
7.5bn, a feat President Bill Clinton and other Nafta proponents cite as
proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs. But
the growth of US sales to Mexico is slowing. The trade surplus has declined
from Dollars 380m in January to Dollars 120m in June as Mexico sinks towards
recession.
To Ms Thea Lee, an economist in the labour-supported Economic Policy
Institute, the trend is 'going the way we predicted; exports are rising but
imports are rising faster'. Ultimately, she contends, the trade surplus will
be in Mexico's favour, and the US will lose 550,000 jobs.
Mr Manuel Suarez-Mier, a visiting fellow at the Georgetown School of
Business Administration, believes nervousness over Nafta's prospects in
Congress has contributed to the the stagnant trade picture. The slowdown in
the Mexican economy is a consequence of high interest rates, in place partly
to control inflation and partly to offset the 'Nafta jitters' in a
securities market worried that Congress will damage the trade pact.
But powerful Nafta opponents - followers of Mr Ross Perot, the populist
billionaire, labour and many environmentalists - paint a depressing picture
of the US-Mexican trade relationship. In his new anti-Nafta book, Mr Perot
points out that Dollars 15.5bn of last year's Dollars 40.6bn US exports to
Mexico was capital goods. This, he asserts to the uninitiated, means
factories.
'When Smith Corona closed its typewriter factory in Cortland, New York, last
year and shipped its manufacturing equipment to Tijuana, Mexico, the
transfer of equipment counted as an 'export' from the US,' he says. 'At this
rate, the US will go bankrupt running up trade surpluses.'
He labels 'a myth' the administration's contention that Nafta will create a
vast, lucrative new market. 'The United States is the market,' he says.
'Mexican consumers do not have the money to buy American or Canadian
exports.'
At the Commerce Department's Mexico Office, where US-Mexico trade is
analysed, the US trade surplus slowdown is seen as 'a temporary pause', due
to slower growth in the Mexican economy and lower demand for imports.
Ms Regina Vargo, the office's director, says Mr Perot is purveying myths of
his own. The US ships a lot of capital goods to Mexico, because that is what
it produces competitively, she says. Capital goods comprise 40 per cent of
US exports worldwide, but only 33 per cent of US exports to Mexico.
What has been growing are sales of consumer goods. Giant US retailers are
undergoing an 'enormous expansion' and helping to renovate Mexico's retail
sector. The average Japanese last year spent Dollars 47 on US consumer
products. The average Mexican spent Dollars 49 - spurring sales of US-made
textiles, clothing, carpets, furniture, musical instruments and sporting
goods.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Another one under his belt: Nafta was a lesson for Clinton
on the power of his office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spinmeisters are having a field day now that Nafta is over and won.
President Bill Clinton's fans say he alone pulled it off, demonstrating
toughness with his own Democratic party, persuasiveness in argument and
shrewd tactical sense in understanding that this was a victory that could
only be gained late in the day. He displayed, they said, the sort of
resilience against all odds that characterised his election campaign and
this means broad sunlit uplands ahead, even in the Washington political
swamp.
His detractors are dismissive, saying he was too slow to realise that Nafta
might lose, bought it with give-away deals, was bailed out by his
vice-president, Al Gore, conqueror of Ross Perot in televised debate, and
only survived on the backs of a Republican vote he can never again take for
granted.
The truth is an amalgam of some of the above, and more besides. Perhaps the
most objective assessment has come, surprisingly, from Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican leader, a Nafta supporter but normally the most partisan of
politicians.
'I have to say I am impressed,' he said hours before the House voted but
when victory seemed assured. 'I had my doubts but it has become clear that
he understands it is important to win and he has not just stuck with it but
fought hard and realised what would happen to his presidency he if he
failed.'
The same could have been said for the budget battle in July and will
doubtless be said again when healthcare reform comes to congressional crunch
next year. The Clinton presidency, it seems, is destined to live or die on a
handful of hard-won votes. It may be a rum way to run a railroad but from
Tokyo to Paris these are the tracks on which democratic governments are now
consigned to run.
The clear lesson from Nafta, certain to be duplicated over healthcare, is
the extent to which most of the tough domestic issues, taxation only partly
excepted, cut completely across party lines. Success or failure depends on
amassing a series of shifting coalitions, often with unlikely bedfellows.
Most of the Democrats who sustained Mr Clinton over the budget deserted him
over Nafta. A majority of the Republicans, who voted as a bloc against the
budget because of its tax increases, supported him on Nafta. Already on
healthcare there are more glimmerings of an alliance between the White House
and moderate Republicans than with conservative Democrats. Liberal members
of the president's own party somehow have to be brought on board, if only to
offset the certain opposition of the Republican right wing.
The fault lines in both parties are now very deep. Democratic wounds,
especially with organised labour, will take some repairing. But Mr Clinton,
always good at political healing, was conciliatory in victory on Wednesday
night, as was Mr Thomas Foley, the Democratic Speaker of the House, in the
last speech of the great debate. With time the unions will probably retract
threats to work against Democrats who supported Nafta. They will fight Gatt,
if it comes to them, but with small expectation of success and thus much
less effort.
It is no exaggeration to say that Nafta might prove to be the last great
stand of the old left. Deprived of the demonology of the Reagan/Bush
presidencies and with tenuous peace prevailing in central America, it has
been pushed to find great causes around which to unite. Working with Ross
Perot and the 'America First' brigade cannot have been a pleasant
experience, especially since it came up short.
Divisions in the Republican party, contemplating a ferocious contest for the
1996 presidential nomination, are perhaps more profound now that the Cold
War no longer provides cohesion. Jack Kemp, who probably will run, and Pat
Buchanan, who says he will not again, slugged it out on TV this week
offering two very different visions of what the party should look like - and
both come from its right wing.
One of the more fascinating spectacles of the past two weeks has been the
performance of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the chief Republican
attack dog and almost certain to be its next leader in the House. Not only
was he seen co-operating closely with President Clinton, a prospect once
considered unthinkable, but he was even nice to some of his less
conservative colleagues. He also delivered the goods, in the shape of 132
Republican votes for Nafta. It is a larger question, however, if this
bipartisan approach will extend to other issues, above all healthcare.
A clear loser in Nafta was Ross Perot, increasingly perceived as not only
just another politician but also a most bad-tempered one. Both parties,
especially Republicans, will be relieved at this, but the well of discontent
he tapped last year as an independent presidential candidate has not
evaporated and there is every chance that he will continue to throw his vast
financial resources at issues which catch his fancy, including healthcare.
But it is Bill Clinton who gets the most attention. Here he is, 10 months
into his presidency, with two big victories under his belt and a long list
of lesser ones yet still unable to command the heights of respect that his
record might seem to warrant. This month's off-year elections showed no
regard.
Polls this week, admittedly taken before the vote, put his approval rating
at generally below 50 per cent. This is the lowest of any president after
nearly a year except, curiously, Mr Reagan. Since Nafta seemed so dimly
understood by most Americans there is no assumption that Clinton will get a
lasting bounce up again. His poll standing seems to rise most when little is
happening - as in the summer.
In a TV interview this week, Mr Clinton was typically philosophical. 'Any
time you try to change as many things as we do, you put yourself on the
line. But that's the kind of person I am. I didn't run for president to
husband my popularity or to be very limited in my aspirations.'
What he might have learned from this struggle, though, is a lesson in the
power of his office. All along, even when it appeared well ahead, the
anti-Nafta coalition confessed a fear of what might happen if Mr Clinton
woke up to this fact, not simply because of the patronage at his disposal
but also because of the force of argument he could bring to bear.
He had been pondering this, too, though for non-trade reasons. A few weeks
ago, he held a White House dinner for a small group of intellectuals,
including William Julius Wilson, the black sociologist from the University
of Chicago. Their advice was the imperative of using the presidency once
again as a 'bully pulpit', as Theodore Roosevelt once called it and as
Ronald Reagan so effectively used it.
Thus, last weekend, at Rev Martin Luther King's old church in Memphis, Mr
Clinton delivered a powerful sermon on crime and on the responsibilities of
black citizens to arrest the decay of their families and communities. Dr
Wilson probably was nodding in approval.
It is a far cry from this message to the legislative complexities of
anti-crime legislation and healthcare. Some White House officials already
think Mr Clinton spreads himself in public too thinly, others want him to
impose himself with greater authority on the political culture. Both seem
difficult to achieve, given his intellectual and political eclecticism.
Meanwhile, business will go on. Nafta digested and the instant spin spun
out, it will be back to healthcare, Bosnia and Haiti, a possible Cabinet
reshuffle, a balanced budget amendment, the Gatt conclusion, Apec in
Seattle, Nato in Brussels and Yeltsin in Moscow. At least the foreigners now
have reason to be impressed.

FT  28 APR 93 / White House shrugs off Panetta's Nafta doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday tried to minimise the impact of published remarks
by Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, to the effect that its economic
programme was in trouble in Congress and that the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) currently was politically 'dead'.
President Bill Clinton said he had no reason to be angry with Mr Panetta. Ms
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, insisted the legislative
programme was 'on track', that Nafta was 'alive and well', and that Mr
Panetta was only speculating on its prospects 'if it went up to the Hill
this week'.
She said that whatever the current opposition the Nafta treaty would be seen
in a different light when it was eventually presented for ratification with
supplemental agreements now being negotiated with Canada and Mexico. Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, also told Congress yesterday that the
treaty remained an administration priority.
Mr Panetta was particularly concerned at the anti-Nafta campaign being waged
by Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate. This, he
said, 'makes it even more difficult' to get the treaty through Congress when
it already had many enemies.
The general thrust of his comments, in an interview with US reporters, did
not appear to help the administration, recently defeated over the Dollars
16bn (Pounds 10bn) stimulus package and increasingly subject to criticism
from Congress over various aspects of its extensive domestic agenda.
The budget director, a former congressman from California, specifically said
he was advising Mr Clinton to delay releasing his plan for healthcare
reform, probably due out next month, until after the budget reconciliation
bill has been voted in June.
He predicted stiff congressional resistance to published proposals to trim
the costs of Medicaid and Medicare, the federally funded health care
programmes, to the energy tax in its present form, to the investment tax
credit, already under fire from Democrats, and to the new student loan
programme.
He thought there was no chance of passage of a value added tax unless it
were a 'revenue neutral' substitute for payroll and income taxes.
The president ran the risk of seeing his programmes torn apart by a
combination of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. He urged Mr
Clinton 'to define his priorities more clearly,' and to be willing to carry
the fight for his proposals to the public.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: US textiles caucus urges tougher stance in
trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton is being pressed by members of the House textiles caucus
to harden the US stand in textile negotiations in the Uruguay Round to win
votes for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ten congressmen from textile and apparel producing states last week told the
president that commitments on a number of issues - including the Uruguay
Round - 'would help decide our vote on Nafta and could influence the vote of
other Members with textile and apparel constituencies.'
The Clinton Administration is engaged in a frantic last minute effort to eke
out 218 votes in favour of Nafta. Most of the members, who signed the
letter, are undecided or planning to vote against Nafta, but they are less
worried about Nafta than the Uruguay Round. However, in Geneva the US is
being pressed to make further concessions by lowering its highest tariffs.
'The US has already made significant concessions in the Uruguay Round,' they
said in a letter to the President. 'If you want support for Nafta from
members from textile constituencies, extend the phase-out of the Multifibre
Arrangement from 10 to 15 years.'
This would also be supported by the Caribbean countries, who 'realise that
it will be hard for them to compete in the US market against lower-wage
nations like China once trade-allocation by quotas is eliminated.'
The congressmen said the staging of tariff reductions and quota phase-outs
should be gradually implemented over a 15 years. For quotas, the US should
not agree to lift restrictions on products for which foreign market
penetration exceeds 20 per cent until the last possible stage.
The US industry and their European counterparts are close to agreement on
tariff reductions, they added. 'Our government should make no offer beyond
the levels European and American industry have discussed.'

<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a
North American Free Trade Agreement.
However, an unexpected twist in Mexico City saw President Carlos Salinas
using the same occasion - for the signing of labour, environmental and
import surge side agreements - as an opportunity to downplay the deal's
importance to the Mexican economy.
'No one will do for Mexico what Mexico does not do for itself,' he said.
In Washington, Mr Clinton said his administration would 'make our case as
hard and as well as we can,' in support of the pact between the US, Canada
and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe
that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The US ceremony began with the entrance of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter
and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the Chief.
Vice-president Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta.
He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war . . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the Middle East.'
Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta
debate, in a way that has been previously lacking, as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
The president said workers had become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is
behind most of the opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in
a time of change, the only way to recover your security is to broaden your
horizons and to adapt to the change.'
Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Mr Jimmy Carter to
take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a
demagogue . . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.
The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month
would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the
month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further
pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday he saw no
evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of
previous economic stimulus packages to emerge.
The Economic Planning Agency, traditionally more optimistic than the central
bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the second half of
the current tax year to March.
Private sector analysts' forecasts for the full year range widely, from an
economic decline to something below last year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself
the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade surplus is going up and there is no
growth in the short term. Now let's get some policy response,' said Mr James
Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the
past 16 months, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn
(Dollars 226bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the first
quarter, holding out the short-lived prospect of a recovery.
The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a
5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this
was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5
per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private
consumption, down 0.6 per cent as Japanese spent less on cars, furniture and
clothes.
Japan's trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent
from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand
and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of Japan's exports were
the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent over the same
period.
Japan's surplus with the US, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars
3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with Washington just a few
weeks before Mr Morihiro Hosokawa meets US president Bill Clinton for the
first time since he became prime minister.
A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in August in bankruptcies with liabilities of
more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, Teikoku Data
Bank. This was the first increase in four months; compared with July,
company collapses were up 5.6 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free
Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides
of the US-Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday.
Referring to the Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he
acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also
an investment agreement'.
Because it would make Mexico a 'much more attractive' investment, the Bush
administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and
investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the interest of both the economies of
Mexico and the US, see that basic environmental standards and labour
standards are observed?' he said.
A few hours before the president spoke, his private sector and labour
advisers were briefed about the progress of the new Nafta negotiations. One
said labour union representatives now seemed hopeful they could use the
opportunity to strengthen labour law enforcement in both the US and Mexico.
The administration will try to satisfy labour in order to fend off attacks
by Mr Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, who is
still loudly opposing Nafta.
'Its going to be a tough spring,' the adviser said. 'There is a problem
between the US and Canada, the US and Mexico, and the administration and the
Congress. Congress wants a lot of teeth. Our guys know wonder how they can
get teeth when they know (the enforcement provisions) work both ways.'
Mr Clinton referred in his press conference to a Bush administration foreign
aid programme in which the US 'spent taxpayers' money to encourage American
companies to invest in Central America who then went down there and actually
lowered wages instead of raising them in the host company'.

deal is still alive

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is making a concerted drive to prove that the
North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada is not dead.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, threw the administration
and the Democratic congressional leadership into turmoil earlier this week
with the warning that Nafta simply could not pass Congress.
The loud criticisms of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas populist, were making the
task much more difficult, he said.
Since then, administration officials have gone out of their way to reaffirm
their commitment to the treaty.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, insisted that the
administration intended to complete this summer the side agreements on the
environment, labour standards and import surges which President Bill Clinton
has asked for.
'We intend to take Nafta to the Congress and we intend to meet the January
1, 1994 deadline for the implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement,' Mr Kantor said.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, acknowledged that winning
congressional approval would be difficult, but said Nafta's passage was
important for US relations with the whole of Latin America, and not just
Mexico.
'It's going to be a tough time passing it. It will not be easy, but I am
optimistic that we will get there, and this year,' he said.
Congressional leaders acknowledge that Mr Panetta's vote count is correct,
but say that, with the side agreements still to be negotiated, it is
scarcely surprising that Nafta does not yet have the necessary support.
Foreign governments and Washington trade analysts have at times been
perplexed over who in fact controls US trade policy, and there have been
reports of rifts between Mr Bentsen, with a broadly free trade approach, and
Mr Kantor, whose style has been more confrontational.
Mr Bentsen, however, insisted that trade policy was Mr Kantor's
responsibility.

European trade negotiators arrive in Washington today for a two-day meeting
with US counterparts that is likely to determine the shape and scope of the
Uruguay Round package of world trade reform.
'I am confident now that there will be an agreement by December 15,' the
deadline set for an accord, a European Union negotiator said before
departure. 'The Washington meeting will decide whether it is a big deal, or
something more modest.'
While warning that a 'small package' would be much harder for national
governments to ratify, he signalled that outstanding differences over
protection and subsidies for steel presented a stumbling block. Negotiators
would be trying to 'reduce matters to an absolute minimum' - focusing on
market access, trade in services, anti-dumping rules, subsidies and
disciplines over support for steel and aircraft.
The Washington meeting between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, will allow EU negotiators to
learn how events of the past week have influenced US strategy towards
completion of the Uruguay Round. The EU has been a spectator during the
approval by the US Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement and
the US courtship of Asian nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
summit in Seattle.
US officials said at the weekend they believed that winning congressional
approval for Nafta had strengthened their hand in the Uruguay Round
negotiations and had improved prospects of congressional support for the
Gatt deal.
'A good consequence of the Nafta win is that while we really would like a
deal, we don't have a high octane political need for one. When the president
says we want a good one, we can mean that,' an administration official said.
The Senate voted Nafta through on Saturday by 61-38. A total of 34
Republicans joined 27 Democrats in favour of the measure; 28 Democrats and
10 Republicans opposed it.
As the Uruguay Round approaches December 15, after which President Bill
Clinton will lose his fast track authority to negotiate without line-by-line
congressional oversight, the White House believes that the Nafta battle has
re-established a constituency for free trade within Congress.
Mr Clinton said that the US would 'not accept a flawed agreement' but added
that a good Gatt deal could create 1.4m jobs in the US over 10 years.
Tom Burns adds from Madrid: President Francois Mitterrand of France
underlined that the road to a Gatt agreement remained rocky when he used
bilateral weekend talks with the Spanish government in Madrid to deliver a
stinging attack on what he said were bullying US tactics following the Nafta
accord.
He was supported by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, who warned in a
joint press conference with Mr Mitterrand and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish
prime minister, that the US would have to soften its stance on Gatt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A victory for President Bill Clinton, a federal appeals court yesterday
overturned a ruling that US officials must prepare an environmental
assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The unanimous 3-0 decision reversed a lower court's ruling, which had
threatened to delay, if not scuttle, the proposed free trade pact between
the US, Canada and Mexico.
The earlier ruling would also have set a precedent which could have affected
other US trade agreements, including the Uruguay Round. Environmental impact
statements (EIS) take months to prepare, and sometimes years to argue when
they are challenged in court.
On June 30, the US trade community was thrown into an uproar when three
environmental and public interest groups - Public Citizen, the Sierra Club
and Friends of the Earth - successfully argued for US officials to prepare
an assessment of Nafta's impact on the environment.
District Court Judge Charles Richey ruled that the three groups had
'demonstrated that there is a reasonable risk that Nafta may cause
environmental injury'.
The administration swiftly appealed, arguing that while agency proposals
might be subject to the EIS rule, the president is not. It is the president
who submits trade agreements, and his ambassador who negotiates them.
The appeals judges agreed and said the plaintiffs could not even sue until
executive action was final, that Nafta has yet to be sent to Congress, and
the side agreement on environment 'may well change the dimensions of the
conflict over potential environmental damage'.
Although yesterday's ruling is likely to be appealed again to the Supreme
Court, the court is not required to hear the case, and, if it does, is not
expected to reverse it.
While the White House yesterday was claiming victory, the three groups which
brought the suit could claim gains in the court of public opinion. In early
summer, most Americans were just beginning to learn about the trade pact.
The publicity given the court action brought the environmental link into the
news.
Nafta has become the most controversial trade agreement in memory, as
opponents fan the fears of job losses and environmental damage. The
administration is finally pushing hard for the pact, but it will be an
uphill battle.
Free-traders in Congress worry that the unpopularity of Nafta bodes ill for
the more important Uruguay Round. They worry that, if the pact is defeated,
loss of US credibility will hamper the already arduous negotiations in
Geneva and strengthen the forces of populism and protectionism in Congress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITE HOUSE yesterday chose to characterise as 'merely a difference of
opinion' President Bill Clinton's criticism of strong-arm trade union
tactics to persuade members of Congress to vote against the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
Towards the end of his Sunday television interview, the president himself
had qualified his attack.
Advised during a commercial break of the initial news agency headlines of
his earlier comments, Mr Clinton said: 'These guys are my friends. I just
don't agree with them on Nafta.'
Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, went on television
yesterday to deliver the same message. The president and the unions 'shared
a lot of common ground,' he said, although Nafta was an exception.
Nevertheless, Mr Thomas Donahue, general secretary of the AFL-CIO, the
umbrella union organisation, had on Sunday evening accused Mr Clinton of 'a
cheap shot', one which was 'part of a desperate effort to capture votes'.
Only a tiny fraction of organised labour has come out in favour of Nafta,
though opposition to it from some white-collar and federal employee unions
has been muted.
More typical was a comment to the Washington Post yesterday by Mr William
Bywater, head of the electrical workers union: 'I tell any Democrat
(preparing to vote for Nafta) I am not going to support any of them, period.
I will try to get a candidate to run against them in the primary,' even if
it meant a seat falling to the Republican party.
Meanwhile, one employer with a heavily unionised workforce did come off the
fence yesterday in Nafta's favour. United Parcel Service, the country's
largest employer of members of the Teamsters union (165,000 out of the
company's payroll of 240,000), said that 'the trade boom from Nafta will
result in hundreds of new UPS jobs', most of them for union members.
Mr Clinton was critical on Sunday of US corporations for not lobbying hard
enough in favour of the agreement, though the shift in the UPS position had
been decided on Friday. Some substantial business political contributors
have also privately threatened to withhold funds from those who vote
against.
The president himself was fully engaged in the lobbying effort yesterday,
with three White House meetings and a dinner for 15-20 undecided members of
Congress on his schedule.
But most attention was focused on tonight's televised debate between
Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and last
year's independent presidential candidate.
The Justice Department yesterday confirmed that the FBI had passed on to Mr
Perot a death threat which, he said, came from a 'Mafia-like' group working
for Nafta approval.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US political sands shift under Nafta -
Prospects for the free trade deal are no longer so certain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement
seemed assured.
The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of the
Republican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospective
Democratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and most
of the Democratic leadership in Congress.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushed
to the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire. His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,
and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President
Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue. Although many working class
Hispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino business
organisations cautiously support the pact.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress
to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta
approved by Congress this year. Between retirements and election defeats,
one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee
the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the
agreement at the most politically opportune time.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive
director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a
weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to
Mexico.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the
Congress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action on
environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they
don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional
Democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't
matter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.
The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its
ground well in the House. It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,
introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman and majority leader Richard Gephardt,
which warns that they will not support a Nafta that does not have strong
environment or food safety provisions. Fifty-seven of the 200 signatories
voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on
the issue.
'There are millions more people who 'get' the Nafta now,' said Ms Lori
Wallach of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. 'They have been contacted by their
local churches, labour unions, farm groups, environmental or consumer
organisations. There is a new awareness of its costs and that has come back
to their representatives in Washington.'
In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator Don
Riegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.
'If the Riegle resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'we
might as well kiss Nafta goodbye.'

   Anyone who has been in Mexico City lately knows that the
city has a fair amount of industrial pollution. Now the talk
of including Mexico in a North American Free Trade Agreement
has stirred environmentalists' complaints that such an
arrangement would export a lot of Mexican pollution north of
the border.
   U.S. unions also complain about Mexican pollution. They
argue further that Mexican plants aren't subject to all of
the anti-pollution regulations that apply to U.S. plants.
It's easy to guess, though, that their major concern is that
NAFTA would send American jobs south of the border -- to
Mexico and its relatively low-cost labor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's impossible to come up with an easy answer. In a
National Bureau of Economic Research paper (Working Paper No.
3914), Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger of Princeton seemed for
a while to have done so. Their research indicated that
air-quality measures in a cross-section of countries indicate
that economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems
once per-capita income reaches $4,000 to $5,000.
   Mexico is already at $5,000 and thus possibly at the point
where further growth would generate new political pressure
for environmental protection and perhaps changes in private
consumption. The current Mexican government already has
reduced the lead content of gasoline, ordered several power
stations to burn natural gas instead of sulfur-generating
fuel oil, and shut refineries and private firms found to be
major sources of air pollution.
   Presumably Mexico still has a comparative advantage, at
least over the U.S., in pollution-control costs. But authors
Grossman and Krueger find little evidence that this advantage
has drawn much business to Mexico. They speculate further
that removal by Mexico of barriers to direct U.S. investment
could lead to specialization in low-polluting industries.
   If NAFTA works as well as its U.S. labor union critics
fear, it is a safe assumption that it will make Mexico more
prosperous. A more prosperous Mexico would be better able to
afford pollution-control systems and devices. After all,
hardly anyone is fond of dirt.
   The Princeton authors admit that they haven't offered the
last word on this subject: "Our findings must remain
tentative until better data become available," they write.
"We have been unable to use any information about the
pollution situation as it currently stands in Mexico, since
environmental monitoring there has been unsystematic at best.
Furthermore, the kinds of pollutants that we can examine are
limited by data availability."
   These are by no means the only obstacles to Mexico's
participation in NAFTA. This is an election year in the U.S.,
and legislators sensitive to union views -- particularly
legislators based in the South and Southwest -- have strongly
opposed Mexico's participation in NAFTA.
   There is, moreover, an entirely different sort of
opposition to NAFTA. There are many economists who believe
that free trade pacts such as NAFTA will steadily undercut
international free trade agreements, such as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Regional trading blocs have
done very well through the 1980s, while GATT seems to have
run aground.
   The European Community has sailed ahead, adding members
and planning to add more. Europe 1992, its expansion plan, is
regarded as so sure a thing that U.S. companies are rapidly
expanding in Europe to take advantage of it. At the same
time, GATT, which was supposed to have completed its Uruguay
Round by late 1990, has yet to reach an agreement.
   Some trading blocs seem more natural than others. Even
without the EC, European countries presumably would be doing
the bulk of their trade with one another, and North America
also seems a natural area. An agreement between the U.S. and
Korea would seem less natural. Even Israel, with its ties to
the U.S., would fit better with Europe.
   Some economists still see hope that GATT will reach an
agreement and, in the meantime, fear that its progress would
only be impeded by arrangements such as NAFTA. If GATT does
finally settle its differences, they say, NAFTA and similar
pacts would fit in quite nicely.
   Mexican and U.S. trade officials, however, are unlikely to
stand aside cheerfully while GATT tries to solve its
problems. The current Mexican government is embarked on
economic reform, a program that could be quite beneficial to
the U.S. as well as the Mexican economy.
   It's a difficult job, particularly when you consider the
obstacles. If it succeeds, however, Mexico may be not only
more prosperous but cleaner as well.

it was that, as a Democrat, he could break the legislative 'gridlock' by
working with the majority in both houses of Congress. Yet his main
achievement since taking office has been to scrape together, after months of
lobbying, the narrowest of congressional majorities for a distinctly
unadventurous budget. Within a few months now the political horizon will be
dominated by next year's congressional elections. If the president has not
by then firmly established his authority and used it to impose his own
agenda he will be in severe danger of becoming the third out of the last
four presidents to leave office after only one term.
The US political season opens today with a press conference at which the
vice-president, Mr Al Gore, will announce his proposals for 'reinventing
government'. In European terms this is partly about subsidiarity - letting
lower-level civil servants get on with their jobs and take decisions without
for ever referring to higher authority. In British terms it also contains a
dash of 'citizen's charter' - giving taxpayers guarantees of quicker and
better service for their bucks. In American terms there is something even
more familiar about it: a promise to cut the deficit by eliminating waste.
Such savings have generally proved illusory in the past. Perhaps Mr Gore
will do better, but in any case his performance will only be the hors
d'oeuvre. The substantial items on Mr Clinton's menu are healthcare and the
North American free trade agreement.
Fragmented consensus
Health is the issue he has made peculiarly his own. He believes the
uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs is the single most urgent
problem facing America, a view that is widely shared, not least in the
business community. But, as the budget deficit issue shows, it is not enough
to achieve consensus on the urgency or importance of a problem in general
terms. Consensus quickly fragments when specific groups discover the problem
is to be solved at their expense. The chances against Mr Clinton achieving a
workable healthcare package on the first try do not seem promising.
But at least he will try. There is no danger of that issue going by default.
It would be agreeable to say the same, with the same confidence, about the
issue of free trade, whether in the North American regional context or the
broader one of Gatt.
Deserves credit
Certainly Mr Clinton is on record as favouring both ratification of Nafta
and an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. He deserves much of the credit
for the breakthrough achieved in Tokyo in July, and he can hardly be blamed
if it is sabotaged by French threats to veto the Blair House agreement on
agriculture which the EC negotiated with his predecessor. But while it is
primarily for Europeans to deal with that European problem, there are many
other items in the round still to be agreed, and they are unlikely to be so
by the December deadline without intensive political involvement at the
highest level.
Some US businessmen see Nafta as an alternative to the Uruguay Round, even a
chance to punish Europe with a taste of its own regional protectionist
medicine. That would be a good reason for opposing it, but there is little
or nothing in the agreement to justify such an interpretation.
Those who oppose Nafta in the US, from Mr Ross Perot to Mr Ralph Nader and
the environmental movement, the trade unions, and an awkwardly large number
of Democratic congressmen, do so for other reasons. Mr Clinton has not
surrendered to these lobbies, but his handling of them has dismayed the
treaty's supporters.
That issue now cries out for real leadership, as do a number of foreign
policy issues: not least the Bosnian imbroglio, where Mr Clinton's
indecision cannot be excused by, even if it does not in turn excuse, the
feebleness of his European allies. At home and abroad, he is now being
compared with his last Democratic predecessor, Mr Jimmy Carter. If - as may
be safely assumed - Mr Clinton strongly dislikes that comparison, he must
realise he has only a short time left in which to prove it wrong.
