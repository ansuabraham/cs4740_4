   In an emotional reunion 44 years later, George
Bush paid tribute to the his World War II Navy flying comrades and
the submarine crewmen who nicknamed him ``Ellie'' after pulling him
from the drink.
   Fireworks lit up the sky over the Lincoln Memorial as Bush, about
to become the nation's 41st president, spent half an hour of quiet
reflection Wednesday night with about three dozen of his war buddies.
   ``He spoke with great feeling about what the squadron and the
Finback's crewmen meant to him,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence
Heyworth of Virginia Beach, Va. ``Mrs. Bush's eyes kind of teared up
a little. It was very intimate.''
   Heyworth was gunnery and torpedo officer aboard the USS Finback
in September 1944 when Bush was one of five young Navy aviators
rescued by the submarine after being shot down by the Japanese over
the Pacific.
   Bush has accorded the Finback veterans, the widows of a few
others and an equal number of members of his aircraft carrier
Torpedo Squadron VT-51 from World War II the choicest seats at
several inaugural events.
   But first he welcomed them to his temporary quarters at the Blair
House across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House for a private
reunion.
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark.,
the submarine torpedoman who helped pull Bush out of his bobbing
orange life raft onto the deck of the Finback after he had bailed
out of his flaming torpedo bomber on Sept. 2, 1944.
   ``You have to remember that few of us had seen any of the others
from the Finback for 44 years,'' Kohler said. ``And meeting under
these circumstances where the president-elect personally welcomes
us, it was pretty moving.''
   Kohler said Bush told the group that ``the youngness that was
there all those years ago and the things we were fighting for had a
great deal to do with directing his life and ideas.''
   Bush spent a few moments with each of the veterans, signing
pictures, looking at their scrapbooks, swapping remembrances.
   Heyworth quoted Bush as saying: ``If it weren't for you people in
this room, I wouldn't be here and I certainly wouldn't have been
elected president of the United States.''
   Hugo Parkman, 69, of Stone Mountain, Ga., the Finback's
communications officer, recalled Bush as ``a very clean-cut young
man.''
   ``I shared my bunk with him,'' Parkman said. ``That is, when I
was on duty, he slept, and when he was on duty I slept. On a
submarine everything's so tight, bunks don't get cold.''
   ``He was a very regular guy,'' said Parkman. ``We never knew that
he came from a distinguished family. He didn't tell anybody anything
about that.''
   W.E. ``Bill'' Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent
and retired Navy commander, recalled that Bush was nicknamed
``Ellie'' by the submarine's crewmen because he would imitate a
braying elephant. But it had nothing to do with his aspiring
politics.
   ``We had a nickname for everyone aboard, and George was a very
smart, fun loving guy,'' Edwards said. ``He was always joking,
mimicking this elephant. I think he'd seen too many Tarzan movies.''
   Then a 20-year-old lieutenant and the Navy's youngest pilot, Bush
was flying a bombing run against a Japanese radio communications
center in the Bonin Islands 600 miles south of Japan when enemy fire
struck his TBM Avenger. He later won a Distinguished Flying Cross
for completing the run before bailing out of the flaming plane.

   Michael Dukakis was getting his early
morning exercise walking down a Pittsburgh street, when someone
gave a cry of recognition: ``Hey, isn't that Caliguiri?''
   No, it wasn't Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri: It was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I guess the mayor and I look alike,'' Dukakis said as he
described the Sunday morning greeting. ``There's an old saying in
Italian: `One face _ one race.' We're all part of the same family.''
   Far ahead in the polls here for Tuesday's primary, Dukakis said
the incident shows ``we need to do a lot of work to make sure
people know who Dukakis is on the ballot.''
   The Massachusetts governor himself is working hard _ taking a
whistle-stop train tour across western Pennsylvania on Sunday and
making a six-city flying tour of the state today.
   Dukakis is looking for a fourth straight big-state win here over
his surviving competitor _ Jesse Jackson _ to tighten his grip on
the front-runner's crown and widen his margin in the delegate count.
   ``If we can win big here Tuesday, it will give us a tremendous
boost,'' Dukakis told a big crowd of students on the Pennsylvania
State University campus, who were welcoming back his wife, Kitty, a
Penn State graduate.
   Through the cold, cloudy day in Pittsburgh, Greensburg,
Johnstown and Altoona, Dukakis hit over and over again on his
message of good jobs and economic development in a region
devastated by changes in the steel and coal industries.
   ``If we can't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to
the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter
with us,'' he told a crowd there. ``I believe we can. I believe
we're going to.''
   Dukakis drew the parallels between New England's economic
troubles of the past and Pennsylvania's troubles of the present.
   ``As a New Englander, we went through the same kind of pain and
economic distress as you have,'' he said in Greensburg. ``Our
communities have come back and these communities are going to come
back.''
   Drawing on the two weekend debates between the Democrats,
Dukakis talked of how he and Jackson agree on many issues.
   ``Instead of investing in a lot of exotic weapon systems of very
marginal value, we've got to take these resources and put them _ as
both Rev. Jackson and I said Saturday _ into our infrastructure.''
   But on Sunday, Dukakis brushed off suggestions from Jackson that
he should put out a budget.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters on the chartered Amtrak train,
nicknamed the ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited.''
   And Dukakis resisted pressure from a new Jackson tactic, urging
massive new spending on education, drug control efforts and other
programs.
   The front-runner went down his own list of education programs _
which he says involve only modest spending increases _ while
Jackson said the federal government should double its spending on
education.
   ``We're not going to run the nation's school system from
Washington,'' Dukakis said. ``The thing a president has to do is to
set some priorities and get after them.''
   The Democratic candidate also took a couple of swipes at George
Bush, saying that the Republican nominee-to-be seems more
interested in building aircraft carriers than in rebuilding the
nation's railroads and highways.
   ``Mr. Bush was critical of me ... because I oppose spending $36
billion on two supercarrier task forces that we don't need and we
can't afford,'' Dukakis said. ``If he thinks that's where we ought
to put our scarce resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a
fundamental issue in this campaign.
   ``I think I know where the American people are _ they are tired
of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless
people on streets and in doorways ... and they want a change.''
   If Dukakis is the Democratic nominee, perhaps he will get a wish
expressed wistfully in Pittsburgh.
   ``All of you know me. I suppose we'd all like to suppose that
I'm a household word,'' he told the small crowd. ``I'd like one of
these days to come to Pittsburgh and hear, `Hey, isn't that
Dukakis?'''

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: GERMAN ANCESTOR'S ENGLISH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My ancestor, William Felton, was born in the lowlands of Germany 
about 1770 and arrived in America in 1776 with his parents and two older 
brothers, John and Robert. The parents supposedly died shortly thereafter, 
probably in Pennsylvania. What puzzles me is that Felton is not a German name, 
and I have been unable to find this family on ship passenger lists from 
Germany. My ancestor was bound to a man who raised him in the Presbyterian 
faith. Is it possible he took another name? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Anything is possible in genealogy. Felton is an English location name; 
from Old English meaning feld (pasture or open country) plus tun (enclosure). 
It also is spelled Felten, and to add to the confusion, there is a German 
surname spelled Felten or Feldten. 
</P>
<P>
However, with sons named John, Robert and William, I suspect your family is of 
English origins even though your ancestor supposedly was born in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
You need to make a thorough check in the probate and orphans' court records in 
the county where your immigrant ancestors died. Therein may be additional 
information on this line's origins. 
</P>
<P>
Ship passenger records are not complete for this time period. Examine the 1790 
Census for Felton and Feltin families. There were 53 heads of households with 
this surname -- most of them in New England, but four were in Pennsylvania at 
that time. The older brothers probably were heads of household when the 1790 
Census was taken, and it may be necessary to research them to learn more about 
your ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My maiden name was Musick, which my father says may have been of Czech 
origin. I have seen it spelled Muzik also. Great-grandpa was born in Missouri 
about 1856 in St. Joseph or Jefferson City. Do you have any clues to this 
name's origins? 
</P>
<P>
A: Musick or Music is Polish for peasant or vassal. However, Muzik is Czech -- 
an affectionate nickname for a man of short stature. 
</P>
<P>
These names would have sounded alike to American record-keepers, so your family 
tradition of being Czech is most likely correct. Since your family settled in 
Missouri in the mid-1800s, they probably came during the time of mass 
immigration of Czechs -- who came due to the drought and crop failures in the 
1840s and a revolution in 1848. Possibly your family left from the ports of 
Hamburg or Bremen in Germany and sailed either to New York or Galveston, Tex. 
Many Czechs settled in small towns and villages in Missouri. Examine the 1850 
and 1860 census records of Missouri for more clues; and check for 
naturalization papers. Look for all spellings of your name. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me the origins of the surname Hendricks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hendricks, also found spelled Hendrick, Hendrich and Hendrix, is of German 
origins, meaning a descendant of Heinrich, the German form of Henry, which 
literally means "home, rule." German surnames were originally formed from two 
roots that often have unrelated meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My surname is Fant, which I seldom find. My folks were Swedes, but this name 
does not sound Swedish. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fant has some English roots, as a nickname, meaning an immature person, one 
with the characteristics of a child. However, the name could have been derived 
from "Infante" of Italian and Spanish origins. 
</P>
<P>
How your father's Swedish family came to acquire this name will require a 
fascinating research into genealogical records.

<HEAD>Archeologists Uncover Remains of Capital's Red-Light District</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archeologists digging just three blocks from
the White House have unearthed thousands of relics from Washington's
notorious old red-light district, where Civil War prostitutes earned
their nickname entertaining Gen. Joseph Hooker's troops.
   Shoveling beneath an asphalt parking lot just south of
Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Commerce Department this
summer, investigators found perfume bottles, gaudy buttons, costume
jewelry, garter hooks and a long-forgotten cellar full of whiskey
and beer bottles.
   There was even a tiny, antique Bromo Seltzer bottle for treating
a morning-after malaise.
   Besides these artifacts of the hookers' trade, the investigators
discovered a wide assortment of everyday objects left by common
laborers, immigrants, runaway slaves and other poor folk who once
inhabited the crime-ridden neighborhood known as ``Murder Bay'' in
the mid-19th century.
   The six-week dig was completed just before Labor Day. Experts
have begun the year-long task of cleaning, cataloging and analyzing
the more than 250,000 objects recovered from the downtown site for
clues to the lifestyle of the humble people who lived there more
than a century ago.
   ``Nobody famous lived here. There's no `George Washington Slept
Here','' said Donna Seifert, principal archeologist with John Milner
Associates Inc., a historic preservation firm based in West Chester,
Pa., which conducted the dig.
   ``These were ordinary working folk, and this is one of those rare
opportunities to learn more about what their lives were really
like,'' she said.
   They lived in a hotbed of vice, gambling and rum running in a
squalid community of row houses and alley shanties between 14th and
13th streets, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the National Theater
and some of Washington's fanciest hotels and offices.
   Hooker, the Union commander defending the capital against
Confederate forces, tried to control the army of prostitutes
following his troops by herding the women into Murder Bay, away from
his encampment outside the city. The district became known as
``Hooker's Division,'' and its ladies of the night took the name of
``hookers.''
   A newspaper article from the 1890s, which Ms. Seifert acquired
from the Library of Congress, declared that the area was ``the
plague spot of Washington'' with 109 brothels and 50 saloons.
   ``Grover Cleveland can sit in his bedroom window at the White
House and survey this entire territory,'' the paper said. ``He is
within sight and gunshot of each of these 109 dens which defy the
laws which he is supposed to execute through his commissioners.''
   The prostitutes packed their bags when Congress outlawed brothels
in the District of Columbia in 1914, and the site was razed in the
late 1920s. Plans to build a monumental plaza were abandoned in the
Depression, and the area was paved over in 1931 to create a
1,300-car parking lot.
   Construction is expected to begin in the fall of 1990 on a
multimillion-dollar federal office building and international
cultural and arts center at the site.
   Because government funds are involved, the developer _ the
Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. _ is required by the 1966
National Historic Preservation Act to review the project for its
impact on cultural resources.
   The archeologists hired for the job consulted old maps, census
records and city directories, and began excavating in mid-July in
their search for backyard ``trash pits'' behind the former wooden
and brick rowhouses.
   They uncovered an old cellar from a rooming house whose boarders
included several prostitutes, and salvaged about 200 empty beer and
liquor bottles. Among the popular brands a century ago were Pabst
Milwaukee, Schlitz and ``John Fitzmorris Old Berwick Rye,'' plus
several earthenware jugs of German-brand ginger beer.
   Also found were fish, chicken and steak bones, many dating back
to the Civil War.
   Ms. Seifert says these and other mundane objects uncovered will
yield valuable information about the denizens of the former gambling
dens, saloons, brothels and boarding houses _ what they ate and
drank, what clothing they wore, how they spent their leisure time.
   ``We know how Thomas Jefferson set his table at Monticello and
who his guests were, for example, but we don't know very much about
the everyday dining habits of the ordinary people who lived in
Washington,'' she said.
   ``The documents tell us nothing about how they lived. And these
people did not save and cherish their household items, as the
wealthy did. They were used until they were broken or worn out, and
then thrown away.''

   The bumper stickers bragged, ``Nothing could
be finer than to eat at Digger's Diner.'' Now it's a diner to go.
   Anyone willing to flip flapjacks and hamburgers _ and pay the
cost of moving it _ can have the 1940s-vintage restaurant free of
charge, says William ``Digger'' Young.
   He grew tired of the diner chores because he also was juggling
jobs as a mortician, Butler County coroner, and ``Clown on Roller
Skates'' at children's hospitals and nursing homes.
   ``It's just that I wore too many hats. I'd ... put an apron on
over my suit and pour coffee. You didn't catch me cooking, but I'd
be running the cash register. I liked to be where the money was,''
he said.
   Young, 55, got his nickname from the funeral business his family
has owned since 1896.
   His funeral home is next to the diner, painted brown and yellow
to match. But the location is purely coincidental. Unlike the
funeral business, Young's diner brought customers back, before it
closed a few years ago.
   ``We had great food. Some of my customers were seven days a
week. Some would have breakfast and their evening meals there,
too,'' he said.
   Young wants to use the land occupied by the diner to expand the
funeral home and has been trying to sell the all-steel building for
two years. When no buyers nibbled, he decided to give it away and
placed newspaper ads that offered it ``free for the moving.''
   So far, the response has been pretty dead because no one has
been willing to pay the several thousand dollars necessary to have
the diner dismantled and moved, Young said.
   ``When they find out what it will cost to move it, they don't
seem to want to go any further,'' he said.
   The diner is the all-American variety, a Jerry O'Mahoney Inc.
special from Elizabeth, N.J., with curvaceous lines, stainless
steel trim, vinyl-covered stools and formica counters. It arrived
in Butler on two flatbed trucks in the early 1940s and had several
owners until Young bought it seven years ago.
   The pie was homemade, the burgers thick and the cereal came in
little boxes.
   But now all that's left is the building. Young sold the
refrigerators and countertops to a pizza restaurant in Illinois,
the pizza oven to a Pennsylvania campground, and the stoves, grill
and cash register to a Youngstown, Ohio, restaurant.
   ``Nobody would come in and take the whole place,'' he said.
``Then it got to be that I just started stripping things apart.''
   Stale cake donuts, paper doilies and a baby's yellow rattle
litter the dirty floor, and the walls in the kitchen area are
coated with decades of grease.
   But Young says there's still plenty of life in the diner, which,
with its concrete floor and industrial-strength walls, seems built
to last.
   ``There's stainless inside, good stainless,'' he said, picking
through the rubble to reveal an old menu. ``Paint that steel and
polish the stainless and you have a pretty good looking building.''
   But more than anything, it was an institution in this bustling
western Pennsylvania city of about 17,000. As a teen-ager, Young
remembers well the lines that formed outside.
   ``People waited to get in. It was a very busy diner,'' he said.
   When Young ran the diner, it featured such culinary specialties
as the ``Digger Special'' _ a hamburger topped with a fried egg and
sauteed mushrooms, his favorite.
   Speaking of his decision to give the diner away, he said, ``I'd
like to see it used someplace, and I'd go past and say, `That used
to be mine.'''

<HEAD>Jackson Says He'd Negotiate on Hostages; Dukakis Says `No
Concessions'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today he would
talk with terrorists holding hostages but ``never make
concessions,'' commenting one day after campaign rival Jesse
Jackson criticized what he said was Dukakis' view that ``we should
not negotiate with terrorists.''
   Jackson set off the exchange Sunday when he said, ``I've raised
the point in several debates this year. Every time a question comes
up about terrorism, Mr. Dukakis says, `I'm against terrorism. ...
We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the Middle East,
never negotiate with terrorists.'
   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do
it.''
   Dukakis, in Pennsylvania, told reporters today after being asked
about Jackson's statement, ``I think we need a tough anti-terrorist
policy. ...
   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never make
concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with
is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''
   Jackson, asked today about negotiating with terrorists, said he
would not make ``material concessions'' to them but could conceive
of situations in which he would grant hostage-takers safe passage.
   ``I would never exchange arms for hostages,'' he said, a
reference to the Iran-Contra operations steered by Reagan
administration officials.
   U.S. policy holds that American officials ``will talk to any
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we
will not make concessions,'' a State Department spokesman said
today.
   The gentle battling between the surviving Democratic candidates
got more direct as the candidates closed in on Tuesday's
delegate-rich Pennsylvania primary.
   A new poll, sponsored by Philadelphia's KYW-TV and Pittsburgh's
KDKA-TV, showed Dukakis apparently increasing his lead among likely
Pennsylvania Democratic voters. In the new poll, taken by telephone
over the weekend, Dukakis led Jackson 57 percent to 31 percent with
12 percent still undecided.
   Last week, with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. still being counted,
Dukakis led Jackson 45 percent to 34 percent, with 14 percent
undecided and 7 percent for Gore. The polls, with a margin of error
of five percentage points either way, were conducted by KRC
Research of Cambridge, Mass.
   It was Jackson who has stirred the biggest controversy in recent
days with his call on Sunday for negotiation with anyone to free
hostages.
   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up
preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' Jackson said at a rally in
Washington. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the
hostages out of Beirut.''
   Eight Americans are currently held hostage by Moslem extremists
in Beirut.
   On Sunday, Dukakis did a whistle-stop tour of Pennsylvania, but
he was switching to the air today, hitting six cities to make an
impression in every media market in the state before the voters go
to the polls Tuesday.
   Jackson raised money in Washington before returning late Sunday
for a final push in the Keystone State.
   Dukakis has a big lead in the polls in Pennsylvania, where 178
delegates are at stake. The complicated process _ with delegates
elected individually _ offers a challenge to voters who may have to
pull the lever up to 12 times. But it also offers Dukakis, if he
does well, a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates than
Jackson.
   ``You've got to vote more than once. This is the one time you
can do so legally,'' he told students at Penn State University in
State College. ``Vote early and often _ vote for me and vote for my
delegates.''
   Dukakis is more than half the way to a delegate majority,
holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. Jackson has 836.1 while
599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win
the nomination at the July convention in Atlanta.
   Guam's three convention votes entered the uncommitted column
Sunday evening following caucuses on the Pacific island.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush is virtually
unchallenged on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, when he may win enough of
the 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark _
1,139 _ needed to win the GOP nomination in New Orleans in August.
   A new poll by Time magazine indicates that a Dukakis-Jackson
ticket would get 47 percent of the vote nationwide to 42 percent
for a Republican ticket headed by Bush.
   A Dukakis-Gore ticket would defeat Bush 49 percent to 39
percent, but Bush would defeat Jackson by 52 percent to 34 percent,
according to the poll released Sunday.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis and Jackson have been unusually
cordial recently, but the best-friends atmosphere thinned when
Jackson urged Dukakis to release a proposed budget.
   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for Head
Start,'' Jackson said during the debate Saturday night in
Pittsburgh. ``I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.''
   Dukakis strongly disagreed.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters Sunday on his chartered Amtrak train,
nicknamed the ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited.''
   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that
in great detail,'' Dukakis said as he toured western Pennsylvania.

   Midwest John, Ohio Ned, Steam Train Maury
Graham and others are spreading their bedrolls this weekend in
Britt, home of the National Hobo Convention.
   About 40 hobos from across the country hitchhiked and hopped
freights to be on hand for ceremonies, including funerals for two
``brothers'' buried in the town cemetery.
   ``It's a homecoming of sorts. We're a vanishing breed. There's
no young guys out here anymore,'' said 36-year-old John Becker of
Sterling, Ill., known as Midwest John.
   Becker's traveling partner, Ned McNamer of London, Ohio, said
life on the road is getting more dangerous. Both men wear long
sheath knives hidden underneath sleeveless jean jackets covered
with souvenir buttons.
   ``We came here from the North Town rail yards in Minneapolis.
That's a real jungle,'' said McNamer, who sports the name Ohio Ned.
``In some parts of the country you could get killed for anything _
rings, shoes _ you name it.''
   ``It's a little lonely, sure. But it all depends on what your
tastes are. If you like a 9 to 5 job, fancy slacks, that's nice,
too,'' Becker said. ``But for some of us there's always that urge
to see what's up over the hill.''
   The hobos, mostly men, wore red bandanas, caps and many carried
sturdy walking staffs. They gathered Friday at the Evergreen
Cemetery for services for the Pennsylvania Kid and Hafey the Bo.
They are the fourth and fifth hobos to be buried at the Britt
cemetery. A tombstone also sits in the cemetery for all unknown
hobos who have died.
   ``We remember all of our deceased hobos, those who in hobo
terminology, `have caught the westbound,''' said a hobo named
Frisco Jack.
   Members of the Britt American Legion fired a rifle salute and
blew taps for the Kid, whose real name was Paul Wilson. Wilson, a
World War II veteran from Franklin, Pa., died in June at age 80.
   Whiskey was sprinkled on his tombstone.
   ``I know some people may look down on it, but it was what he
requested,'' Graham told the other hobos and a crowd of about 50
who attended the hourlong service.
   ``People think hobos don't make friends. But that is the main
point of our lives. Friends are the wealth of life,'' said Graham,
a short man with a long white beard and mustache who was crowned
King of the Hobos in 1973.
   ``Pennsylvania Kid was the only man I knew who shaved with
broken glass. He'd get a piece from a broken bottle, wrap it up in
toilet paper and put it in his pocket,'' said Graham, a Toledo,
Ohio, native.
   Hafey the Bo, whose real name was Al Zale, was a hobo from Los
Angeles who got his nickname because he suffered from chronic hay
fever. He was remembered as a kind and gentle man.
   ``We're going to miss those guys,'' said the El Paso Kid.
   The National Hobo Convention first came to Britt in 1900 when
Thos. A. Way, T.A. Potter and W.E. Bradford decided to do something
to show the world that Britt was a lively little town capable of
doing anything larger cities could do. The convention became a
fixture in 1933.
   The Britt Chamber of Commerce, which runs a small hobo museum in
the lobby of the defunct Old Chief Theatre, plans to expand the
museum to honor hobos, said Marian Malek, chamber secretary. Plans
also call to move the five graves of the hobos to a reserved
section of the cemetery.
   ``Hobos are a decent lot. We are not bums,'' said Joe Baker, 59,
a hobo from North Carolina. ``I've known no other life since I was
13.''
   ``Hobos have hearts, too, and they cry and laugh like everybody
else,'' Graham said.

   It was once called the ``American Clyde,'' after
the Clyde River in Scotland, then a major shipbuilding center in
Europe. Now the Delaware River is losing the last of its once-proud
shipbuilding yards, partially because of a general slump in the
industry brought on by new government policies.

<TEXT>
   When the unfinished hulls of two Navy ships
leave the yard of Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Co., the Delaware River
will be without a shipbuilding business for the first time in more
than 300 years.
   Since William West built the Amity in 1682, the year William
Penn came from England, companies putting together seagoing ships
have been a part of the Delaware River landscape. At one time or
another, there were 38 shipyards along the river and its
tributaries.
   It has been in decline here for decades, but spokesmen say a
national slump in shipbuilding, aggravated by new government
policies, really finished off a once-proud industry that was a
national leader.
   For example, John Fitch advertised steamboat trips along the
Delaware River 17 years before Robert Fulton ran his Clermont along
the Hudson. Some of the Civil War-era ironclad ``monitors'' were
built here.
   Delaware Valley shipyards built boats to defend the America's
Cup. In Wilmington, Del., the Pusey &amp; Jones shipyard built them for
trade on the Amazon River.
   In 1915, with war under way in Europe, American International
Shipbuilding Corp. built what was then the world's largest shipyard
_ 50 shipways employing 34,000 workers. It turned out 122 cargo
ships and troop transports in two years.
   The river was nicknamed the ``American Clyde,'' after the Clyde
in Scotland, then the center of European iron shipbuilding.
   The proud tradition continued down to 1960, when the huge
aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk was launched from the New York
Shipbuilding Corp. yard in Camden, N.J., right across the river
from the Philadelphia waterfront. That yard closed soon after and
is now being demolished.
   The Kitty Hawk is being modernized now in Philadelphia at the
U.S. Navy Yard, which does ship repair work but hasn't built a ship
from the keel up since 1971.
   The two ships the Navy ordered from Pennsylvania Shipbuilding
sit at the river's edge, one tied up in a slip and the other braced
in a dry dock and minus the bow, stern and deckhouse. A mortgage
agreement filed in the Delaware County Recorder of Deeds Office
gives the Navy title to four parcels of land owned by Penn Ship if
the company fails to pay for the costs of finding another company
to finish the work.
   Pennsylvania Shipbuilding was known as Sun Shipbuilding &amp;
Drydock when Sun Oil opened it in 1916 to guarantee a supply of
tankers. Over the years it built 674 oceangoing ships.
   Sun got out of the shipbuilding business in 1982 and sold the
yard to a Texas company that renamed it. It was later sold to three
Mobile, Ala., real estate developers.
   In May 1985, Penn Ship won a $222.4 million contract to build
two fleet oilers for the Navy, vessels that refuel combat ships at
sea.
   The Navy planned to buy 18 of the 677{-foot, T-AO-187 class
tankers eventually, and Penn Ship stood to gain a good share of
that business if it completed the contract successfully.
   It didn't. The Navy renegotiated the contract to $331.4 million,
but Penn Ship announced in February that it didn't have enough
money to finish the ships with the cost overrun factored in.
   Work stopped on the ships and Penn Ship laid off 1,200 workers.
Rumors have said the hulls, one 90 percent finished and the other
70 percent done, will be towed to either Tampa, Fla., or New
Orleans to be finished.
   William Gallagher, the yard's general manager, couldn't say what
would become of the unfinished ships.
   ``The contract has been terminated,'' he said. ``We are not
involved with where they will go. I have no idea when they will
leave.''
   What went wrong? Why couldn't the yard finish a couple of
tankers, basically like ships that were built here for years?
   ``There were a lot of circumstances contributing,'' Gallagher
said. ``We bid in a time frame when labor rates were low. There was
also an expectation of follow-up work. Our costs turned out to be
much higher than we expected, and there was no follow-up work to
spread them over.''

<HEAD>Bush's Wartime Rescuers Remember Him as `Ellie the Elephant'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush may be the Big Elephant in the
inaugural parade next week, but his buddies on a World War II
submarine remember him as ``Ellie the Elephant,'' the fun-loving
young Navy pilot they rescued from the Pacific Ocean 44 years ago.
   Surviving crew members of the USS Finback are looking forward to
a nostalgic reunion with Bush here next Wednesday, two days before
they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the West
Front steps of the Capitol.
   Inaugural planners have passed the word to several Finback
veterans that Bush is setting aside time to meet with them at Blair
House, across the street from the White House, to swap war stories
and renew old acquaintances.
   Prime bleacher seats have been reserved for the inaugural parade
Friday down Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly 30 survivors of the
Finback crew, plus several of Bush's old fellow pilots, who are
expected to attend the inauguration.
   Bush was nicknamed ``Ellie'' by the Finback's officers for his
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant.
   ``It wasn't because we all sat around thinking we were
Republicans,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth, 67, of
Virginia Beach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery
officer.
   ``We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie. We just thought
elepants were funny. We kept asking George to do it over and over
again.''
   Bush was plucked from the Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944, shortly after
he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the
Bonin Islands 600 miles south of Japan.
   Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during the
bombing raid against an enemy radio communications center. The
citation noted that Bush, then only 20, completed his dive and hit
his target even after his plane was hit and engulfed in smoke. His
two crew members were lost.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Don
Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull Bush out
of his bobbing orange life raft to the safety of the Finback's deck.
``Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the United States.''
   During the month he spent on the Finback before saying goodbye at
Midway Island, Bush eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches
and other seagoing duties, watched Betty Grable movies in the
wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's
torpedoes sank two enemy ships.
   Retired Navy Cmdr. W.E. ``Bill'' Edwards, who filmed Bush's
rescue with a Kodak movie camera from the Finback's conning tower,
remembers Bush's surprise that his first meal on the submarine that
night was filet mignon and fresh strawberry shortcake with whipped
cream.
   ``He said he'd been eating nothing but Spam and beans on the
carriers,'' Edward, 67, said in a telephone interview from his
retirement home at Bay St. Louis, Miss.
   Bush was one of three Navy pilots rescued by the Finback during
U.S. carrier raids against the Bonin Islands in early September.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said Heyworth. ``All three pilots we rescued were
bright, bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing
and had the most ebullient personality. He was the most
entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot.''

</P>
<P>
"I'd never sparred with Frazier before but now I was in there banging with him 
and I guess I got a little too loose," Klecko told the New York Times. "He

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Workers Join NYNEX, PacTel In Striking; BellSouth Settles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 41,000 telephone workers at Bell Atlantic
walked off the job Sunday morning, joining counterparts at NYNEX
Corp. and Pacific Telesis who had begun a strike hours earlier,
union and company spokesmen said.
   Mary O'Hara, district coordinator in Philadelphia for the
Communications Workers of America, said talks with Bell Atlantic
broke up around 6:45 a.m. and pickets were being set up.
   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, is parent to local phone
companies in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Talks continued Sunday morning between another union, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the Bell
Atlantic subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said Tom
Duddy, a spokesman for Bell of Pennsylvania. That union represents
11,000 operators and clerical workers at the two subsidiaries.
   Hours earlier, more than 100,000 CWA and IBEW workers walked out
at New York-based NYNEX and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis.
   A tentative agreement was reached between the CWA and a fourth
regional telephone company, Atlanta-based BellSouth, which employs
64,000 union workers and provides phone service in nine states in
the Southeast.
   Officials have said that most direct-dial telephone calls would
not be affected by phone company walkouts, because they are handled
by automated equipment, but customers could expect delays in
directory assistance calls, operator-assisted calls and in service
and installation jobs.
   In all, 221,000 telecommunications workers were covered by the
talks to replace contracts that expired at 11:59 p.m. Saturday. The
four companies provide service to 24 states and the nation's
capital.
   The regional telephone companies, nicknamed ``Baby Bells,'' were
created by the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   Contracts with three of the other ``Baby Bells'' _ Ameritech, US
West and Southwestern Bell _ expire next Saturday. Those three
companies employ 131,000 union workers and provide phone service in
24 states.
   The unions announced the strike against New York-based NYNEX
well before the 11:59 EDT deadline, saying myriad differences
remained. So great were the differences that no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   NYNEX serves seven Northeast states: New York, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of
Connecticut. CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers; IBEW 20,000.
   Talks with Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, were held
throughout the day but the unions announced the strike there at
midnight _ 3 a.m. EDT.
   Pacific Telesis is parent company of California's Pacific Bell
Co. and Nevada Bell Telephone Co. CWA represents 42,000 Pacific
Telesis workers; IBEW 2,500.

<HEADLINE>  INDIAN ISSUE MAY SOON COME TO A HEAD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  High School Report; Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "At some phase, we'll be reacting to those types of issues at schools,"
Larry Gorospe, the new executive director of the American Indian Center of San
Jose, said Tuesday.;   At issue is not only the use of Indian nicknames, but
also the way the nicknames are portrayed by team mascots.;   In particular,
members of the center believe that Fremont High's bug-eyed, huge-nosed mascot
is demeaning.;   "It's really quite grotesque," Gorospe said after being
showed photos of the mascot. "It's not even a good caricature. The problem
with something like this, and in most forms of the media, is that it's a
negative stereotype of Indian people. And what this does is reinforce it. It
has a big nose. It looks almost like a monster.";   Added George Martin, a
local leader of the American Indian Movement, "That's the most disgraceful
thing I've seen in a long time. Is that supposed to be an Indian?";   The
mascot head was purchased from Blackford -- whose nickname was the Braves --
when that school closed last spring, according to Cipriano Sena, Fremont's
student activities director.;   Said Sena: "The kids were interested in it. .
. . We talked about it administratively, and we weren't too pleased about it,
either.";   Though Martin said his group could picket schools or organizing
protests, Gorospe and Rosemary Cambra, chairwoman of the Muwekma-Ohlone tribe
of San Jose, said the best process is to educate people about Indians. Cambra
said she would like to see a partnership developed between Indian and other
community organizations.;   "I believe there is something wrong when certain
teams can use Indians, Braves and Warriors without the consent of the Indian
people," said Cambra, who hadn't seen the Fremont mascot.;   (Like Yerba
Buena, three other area schools use the nickname Warriors. But Westmont High's
is a Spartan-type warrior, and Valley Christian's and Fremont Christian's
nicknames are intended as biblical warriors.);   The complaint of racial
insensitivity was the basis of Stanford changing its nickname from Indians to
Cardinals in 1972 (it became Cardinal in '81). In the past two years, three
California high schools dropped Indian nicknames. Tamalpais of Mill Valley
went from the Indians to the Red Tailed Hawks, the Encina Apaches of
Sacramento became the Bulldogs, and Lowell of San Francisco dropped Indians
and has no official nickname.;   Bernie Schneider, athletic director at
Tamalpais, said his school was caught up in the controversy for nearly a year
before changing nicknames.;   "We went through quite an investigation and had
many different discussions at different levels," said Schneider, whose
school's "Indians" nickname dated to 1908. "We brought Native American groups
on campus to talk. . . . Even though our nickname glorified the bravery of
Indians, the Native American feeling was that they didn't want to be
stereotyped. They just wanted to be people.;   "It caused a lot of division
among our students. Mostly all of our alumni wanted to keep it.";   The only
battle in the South Bay-Southern Alameda County area that has already begun is
at Ohlone College in Fremont. Two students, Hector Miecznikowski and Charmaine
Leonard, are leading an attempt to replace the school's nickname, the
Renegades. Miecznikowski said not only doesn't Renegades fit with the heritage
of the Ohlone Indians, but more important, it doesn't represent the school's
students.;   "I looked it up, and 'Renegades' basically means traitors," said
Miecznikowski. "That's totally different than what you'd think. We call
ourselves the Ohlone Traitors. That's grounds for change itself.";  
Meanwhile, at Yerba Buena and Mission San Jose in Fremont, the only issues
that have been raised regarding their nicknames have centered on their logos.
Brook Vasconcellos, A.D. and football coach at Yerba Buena, said he is
changing his team's logo to make it look like "a more dignified" Indian.;  
Benny Breazeale, student activities director at Mission San Jose, said the
only complaint he has heard in his four years at the school is that some
students want to use a female Indian logo in addition to the male Indian.;  
Vasconcellos and Breazeale said their schools represent Indians in a positive
manner. Phil Kelly, A.D. at Fremont High, said basically the same.;   "When
you take a nickname and don't demean it," Kelly said, "I have a hard time with
(any flap).";   Gorospe doesn't.;   "Even if a mascot showed a traditional
Indian headdress and was noble looking," he said, "I still don't believe in
Indian people being mascots. People shouldn't be mascots, period.";  
Vasconcellos added that if the controversy filters down from Atlanta to Yerba
Buena, he and other school officials wouldn't ignore it.;   "If something like
this was very upsetting to the community," he said, "we'd listen."; Name that

<HEAD>Bush Known as `Ellie the Elephant' After Wartime Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surviving crew members of the World War II
submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with
George Bush, the young Navy pilot they dubbed ``Ellie the Elephant''
after rescuing him from the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago.
   Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull a
grateful Bush to safety from his orange life raft onto the Finback's
deck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty ``welcome aboard,''
but recalls little else about the incident.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Kohler,
a retired Chicago businessman. ``Nobody back then knew he'd become
president of the United States.''
   Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, Bush
eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing
duties, watched Betty Grable movies in the wardroom and donned
earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two
enemy ships.
   Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old Bush as a
gregarious jokester who earned the nickname ``Ellie'' for his comic
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recent
telephone interviews.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth of Virginia
Beach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer when
Bush was hauled aboard on Sept. 2, 1944.
   Said Heyworth: ``All three pilots we rescued were bright,
bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing and had
the most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and he
made us laugh a lot.
   ``We called him Ellie because of his outstanding imitation of an
elephant trumpeting. Ellie the Elephant. It wasn't because we all
sat around thinking we were Republicans. We must have seen one in a
Tarzan movie. We just thought elephants were funny. We kept asking
George to do it over and over again.''
   ``He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled W.E. ``Bill''
Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent and retired Navy
commander. As a bearded ensign aboard the Finback, Edwards filmed
Bush's rescue with an 8mm Kodak movie camera.
   Edwards said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers and
enlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend Bush's
swearing-in at noontime Jan. 20 at the Capitol.
   They and a few of Bush's former flying buddies plan to sit
together in prime bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue for the
inaugural parade after Bush takes the presidential oath of office.
   Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion
for Bush and his old submarine buddies at Blair House, the
presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House,
possibly next Wednesday.
   Heyworth and Edwards have stayed in touch with Bush over the
years. But most of the Finback veterans haven't seen or spoken to
Bush since he left the submarine at Midway Island after a month-long
combat patrol.
   Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing his
bombing run against a Japanese radio communications center in the
Bonin Islands, about 600 miles south of Japan, after his Grumman
Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in
flames. Bush bailed out over the water but his two crew members were
lost.
   According to his autobiography, Bush's only injuries were a gash
on the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war. He
was picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachute
hit the ocean.
   ``I'm proud of what I was able to do to help Mr. Bush on board
our boat,'' said Kohler.
   But Dan Moody, 71, a Finback veteran and retired radiation
laboratory technician living in Albany, Calif., gave little thought
to Bush at the time.
   ``We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,''
he said, and then forgot him.
   ``I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' Moody said.
``Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''

   Will Smith keeps a chessboard handy on the
set of NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'' But like the character he
plays, what he'd really like is a pool table.
   Smith, a Grammy-winning rap singer known as Fresh Prince,
frequently plays chess when he's not working on his new NBC comedy
series. The show is his acting and television debut in the role of
a tough street kid from Philadelphia sent to live with wealthy
relatives in Bel Air.
   The comedy hinges on his attempts to adjust to the alien
environment of wealth and excess, and to bring his relatives back
in touch with their humbler roots.
   The 21-year-old Smith's frequent chess opponent is Joe Marcell,
who plays Geoffrey the butler as though he's just stepped out of
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' They've also had a game on an episode of
the comedy series.
   ``I play a lot of chess, but I don't know if I could say it's a
passion,'' Smith says. ``Pool is more of a passion with me. I put
in a request for a pool table on the set.''
   Smith sees a similarity between himself and his character, also
named Will Smith and nicknamed Fresh Prince. Smith also comes from
the Philadelphia area and says he prefers not to fit in.
   ``I've never done any acting,'' he says. ``I've never had any
formal theatrical training whatsoever. I'm playing a character I
designed five years ago for my rap concerts. It's pretty much a
part of me now.''
   Smith, like his character, is a person who smoothes the way with
incredible charm and an ability to think - and talk - fast. On the
screen he seems at ease and natural, although his lack of training
and experience occasionally surfaces in scenes with other cast
members.
   Prior to its premiere in September, NBC ballyhooed the show as
its breakaway hit of the seasn. As often happens to highly touted
young racehorses, it stumbled coming out of the gate. ABC's ``Cop
Rock'' stumbled even more so, as did ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' last
year.
   In the ratings for its first weeks ``Fresh Prince'' has been
barely ahead of its Monday night competition, CBS' ``Uncle Buck''
and ABC's ``McGyver,'' and trailing ABC's NFL Monday Night
Football.
   Part of the problem may be that the audience apparently is not
reacting well to Smith's making fun of middle-class values. As a
result, some of the sharper edges of the humor are being honed
down.
   ``Fresh Prince,'' like NBC's ``Ferris Bueller,'' which
immediately follows it, is part of television's trend of
youth-oriented comedies - replacing ``sitcom'' with ``punk-com.''
In such shows, including NBC's ``Hull High'' and Fox's ``Parker
Lewis Can't Loose,'' wisecracking kids outsmart slow-witted adults.
   Among those hoping that Smith's ``Fresh Prince'' recording and
stage performance success will transfer to a new audience is 20th
Century Fox, which recently signed him for an action-adventure
movie.
   Smith picked up the nickname Prince in school. It has nothing to
do with rock singer Prince.
   ``My eighth-grade teacher started calling me Prince and it sort
of stuck,'' he says. ``She did that because I was a pretty charming
guy. I had a couple of different names. I don't remember all of
them. When you're rapping you change your name every week trying to
find one that fits. Once I was Willie Will. I settled on Prince in
1986, then I added Fresh because that's the new slang for cool.
   ``I was performing rap at parties by 1981 and getting paid for
it. I always did rap. I play a little piano and guitar.''
   His rap partner was Jeff Townes, and by 1986 they had become
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince. Their first single was ``Girls
Ain't Nothin' But Trouble,'' which they recorded on their own label
and sold nearly 200,000 copies in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New
Jersey. A major company picked it up and it became an international
hit.
   They've since recorded three albums, one of which sold 3 million
copies. A fourth album is due out next year.
   ``Fresh Prince is not very different from Will Smith,'' he says.
``He's fun-loving, mischievous and very handsome. He's just a sweet
fellow. It's me, not a character. It's just me, rapping or acting.
   ``Rap is the only real musical art form we have in America now,
other than jazz. You can listen to Elvis Presley and other stuff.
It's all stolen from black Americans. Elvis is nothing but bits of
Little Richard and Chuck Berry.
   ``Rap is more expressive and more individual. You have to write
your own material because rap comes from the heart. I'd never sing
anyone else's song.''
   Smith says the show is loosely based on the life of Benny
Medina, a record company executive who is a co-producer of the
series.
   ``He literally went from the streets to Beverly Hills High
School in the span of a weekend,'' Smith says of Medina, who
recommended that the ``Fresh Prince'' of rap music would be a
natural TV character.
   ``He saw my music video and never considered anyone else,''
Smith says.

I have just received my sample ballot for the upcoming (June 5) election. In 
reviewing the various candidates I note that entirely too many of them have 
cute little nicknames in parentheses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is old-fashioned to run for public office using your proper name. 
</P>
<P>
If the individuals in question were known better by the nickname it might be 
acceptable. However, in most cases the individuals have simply included the 
common informal name, i.e., Robert -- "Bob" or John -- "Jack." If this is a 
current ploy to win elections, I, for one, will not fall for it. 
</P>
<P>
If these individuals really think this will help voter recognition, I question 
their intelligence. I will vote for the "less cute" candidate and/or the one 
with the less placards attached to utility poles.

<HEAD>Radon's Shadow Remains Over Town That Put It on The Map</HEAD>

   Nearly four years after radon from his
house caused Stanley Watras to set off radiation detectors at the
Limerick nuclear power plant, he wonders daily about his family's
health.
   ``There's a fine line between making yourself sick by worrying
and having a genuine concern and doing the best you can,'' said
Watras, 37, a technical adviser at the plant.
   Radon levels in Watras' home of 800 times the concentration
deemed hazardous first alerted environmental officials and
residents of southeastern Pennsylvania to the danger of indoor
radon concentration. Last week, the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency said the problem is more widespread than
previously believed and urged that every home in the country be
tested.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced by the natural decaying of
uranium found in all soil and rock and usually dissipated
harmlessly into the atmosphere. It poses a health threat when it
seeps through the ground and collects in homes.
   The colorless, odorless gas could be responsible for 20,000 of
the nation's 130,000 annual lung cancer deaths, the EPA estimates.
It kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung,
irradiating the organs for a lifetime.
   Environmental officials first believed radon to be concentrated
along a geological formation known as the Reading Prong, a narrow
area of high-uranium soil stretching from Reading, Pa., across
northern New Jersey into New York state.
   But a recent EPA survey in seven states and Indian land found
health-threatening levels of radon in 29 percent of 11,000 homes
tested.
   The EPA has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as a
guideline for determining when long-term exposure poses a health
threat. A picocurie is a measure of radiation. Exposure to 15
picocuries of radon for a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a pack
of cigarettes a day, the EPA says.
   A reading taken in the living room of Watras' modest,
split-level house in December 1984 was 3,200 picocuries, the
highest ever recorded at a private home. Watras, his wife and two
young children were evacuated soon afterward.
   Tim Hartman, administrator of the state Radon Monitoring Program
set up several miles away in late 1985, said the Watrases' house
was built inches above uranium-laden granite.
   ``He just had an ungodly concentration of radon spewing into his
home,'' Hartman said.
   Watras and his family returned to the house in August 1985 after
a $32,600 research project dramatically reduced the radon level.
Watras and his wife have since had a third child.
   ``At the beginning, we were saying, `Why us?' We were looking at
the children saying, `What did we do to you?''' Watras recalled in
an interview at his home last week.
   Watras now believes God put his family in the home for a purpose.
   ``What we've got to do from now on is try to help other
people,'' he said, calling his efforts to bring attention to radon
``a crusade.''
   Some of the other residents in his suburban Berks County
neighborhood, nicknamed Radon Hills, agree with him and have
organized to push for legislation protecting homes from the toxic
gas. Others believe the threat is overblown.
   Kay Jones, who lives down the street from Watras, is president
of Pennsylvanians Against Radon, a group with about 150 members.
   Ms. Jones believes national building codes should include radon
guidelines, wants public service advertisements that warn people
about the danger of radon and supports a law that would force a
family to leave a home when radon levels reach a certain point.
   Unless the government acts, people will forget about radon as
media interest wanes, she said.
   ``Right now, everything you pick up, it's radon, radon, radon,
but in two or three days it's going to die out,'' Ms. Jones said.
   Dennis Hess, another neighbor, is one of those skeptical about
the radon threat.
   ``I don't think I'm walking into a gas chamber when I walk into
my home. I'd like to think something else will get me before the
radon,'' said Hess, a 34-year-old machinist at a chemical plant.
   Hess hasn't measured the radon level in his home, and he said
environmental officials haven't been able to convince him that the
problem can't be alleviated by opening a few windows.
   No records exist of the number of people who have had their
homes refitted in Pennsylvania to reduce the amount of radon in the
air. Hartman estimated the number was in the thousands, most of
them along the Reading Prong, where 60 percent of the homes tested
had levels above 4 picocuries.
   Even when houses have been fixed, health worries remain.
   ``The fear never goes away,'' said Ms. Jones, whose family spent
five years in a home that recorded a radon level of 450 picocuries
before being fitted with a ventilation system. ``We're living in
the unknown.''

   Snooky Lanson, a singing star of

   Lanson, whose real name was Roy Landman, was nicknamed
``Snooky'' at age 2 after the Irving Berlin tune ``Snooky-Ookums.''
   He got his first singing job with band leader Francis Craig at
Nashville radio station WSM.
   In 1940, Lanson was hired by the Ray Noble Band, and a year
later recorded the hit record ``By the Light of the Silvery Moon.''
   In the late 1940s, he had a hit with ``The Old Master Painter,''
which helped him land the spot on ``Your Hit Parade.'' He sang on
the show from 1950 to 1957.
   Lanson died Monday in Nashville where he had lived since 1967.

   George B. Peters, a dean of men at the
University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s and early 1960s, died
following a long illness.
   He died Saturday at age 75.
   Peters became the university's first dean of men in 1954.
   In May 1955 he led a crackdown on students who threw eggs and
stones at police when a traditional revelry called the Rowbottom
got out of hand. A discipline committee Peters headed suspended 20
students and put six fraternities on social probation for up to
nine months, meaning they could have no female visitors.
   He also served as a finish judge at the Penn Relays from 1934 to
1971.
   Peters became Penn's associate treasurer in 1961 and held the
position until he retired in 1978.
   During World War II, he survived the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and was awarded the Purple Heart. He was a
lieutenant commander in the Navy aboard the USS Maryland.

<TEXT>
   Municipal leaders want to change their
town's ``Queen City'' nickname to ``Superior Location'' because
they think the current moniker might be misinterpreted.
   ``It has come to my attention that there has been a resurgence
of the use of the phrase `Queen City' to describe the city of
Marquette,'' City Manager David Svanda said in a recent letter to
community leaders.
   ``The term's negative connotations conjured by many people do
not give justice to all that the Marquette area has to offer.''
   Visitors might think Queen City refers to homosexuals, said
Mayor Robert Berube.
   Marquette historian Fred Rydholm, who is writing a history of
the Lake Superior port of 23,280 people, said that was silly.
Svanda's request is ``the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,''
Rydholm said.
   The Queen City nickname originated after a 1868 fire, when an
ordinance required all buildings in the center city area to be
rebuilt with stone or masonry, he said.
   Visitors expecting to see the wood construction of other Upper
Peninsula towns in Michigan instead were greeted with tall spires
of stone.
   ``There was nothing from Seattle to Buffalo like it in the
north, and it was also the best port on Lake Superior, so it was
called the Queen City of the North,'' Rydholm said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When George and Barbara Bush set out from the Capitol in their new $600,000 
armored limousine for today's inaugural march, they'll travel a 
much-transformed Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As they near the parade's end and turn toward the White House, they'll view the 
crown jewel of the avenue's $1.5-billion renovation, the Willard Hotel, the 
once vacant Beaux-Arts hotel that was restored to its original opulence and 
reopened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and a host of other buildings and parks are among the major new 
sights that have swept Pennsylvania Avenue since 1961, when President John F. 
Kennedy rode the boulevard for his inaugural and saw a historic street so 
battered, filthy and dreary that he demanded that it be rebuilt to an image 
befitting America's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken almost 30 years, more than $1.5 billion and the efforts of a 
public agency working with private developers to fulfill Kennedy's demand. 
</P>
<P>
But now, gone are the shuttered shops, saloons and cheap hotels. New parks and 
lights, as well as restorations of historic buildings, have given Pennsylvania 
Avenue a clean, expensive look on the inaugural parade route. When the Bushes 
set out today on that path, stretching from the Capitol to the White House, to 
their right will be the newly completed Meade Plaza, featuring the relocated 
18-foot marble monument to Civil War Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade. 
</P>
<P>
To their left will be the dramatic, angular East Building of the National 
Gallery of Art, designed by architect I. M. Pei. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will continue past the Andrew Mellon Memorial Fountain, whose 
54-foot wide bronze basin is the largest ever cast in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cages of Canaries 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes will zip by John Marshall Park, one of five new park plazas 
completed since the last parade. The park connects the avenue to Judiciary 
Square, where cages of yellow canaries lined the walls of Ulysses S. Grant's 
1873 inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Marshall Park's stair-stepped garden and fountains is the gleaming, new 
Postmodern Canadian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up past 6th Street, the Bushes will ride past two elaborately 
refurbished office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Next they will see Washington's most laughed-at monument. The Temperance 
Fountain, featuring entwined dolphins beneath a water crane, symbolizes the 
superiority of water over demon rum. It was donated to Washington by San 
Francisco dentist Henry Cogswell in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Moving along, the Bushes will pass the Federal Trade Commission and another new 
park, Market Square Park Navy Memorial. The park features a 100-foot-wide disk 
inlaid with a map of the world, fountains and a 7-foot statue titled, "Lone 
Sailor." Military bands give concerts there in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houses U.S. Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, on the south side, will be the sprawling National Archives, 
designed by John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Built in 
the 1930s, its 75-foot-high exhibit hall houses the U.S. Constitution, the 
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
As much as those documents are a part of American history, Pennsylvania Avenue 
has been a key, colorful byway of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Pierre L'Enfant -- hired by George Washington to plot a capital in 
the 10 square miles ceded from Virginia and Maryland -- envisioned Pennsylvania 
Avenue as a sparkling boulevard of foreign embassies with unobstructed, 
breath-taking views between the Capitol at one end and the White House, 14 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
But the avenue evolved differently. During the Civil War, a section of 
Pennsylvania Avenue at 14th Street became the city's red-light district. The 
man selected to care for this area was Gen. Joseph Hooker, who distinguished 
himself to such an extent that ladies of the night became known as hookers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissions Appointed 
</P>
<P>
By the 1930s, the shops and boarding houses began to make way for a wall of 
Neoclassical office buildings. In the 1960s, the avenue was a hodgepodge of 
drab office buildings and run-down stores. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon appointed a series 
of commissions to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But a turning point did not come until 1972, when Congress established the 
Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. to supervise the refurbishing of the 
avenue in tandem with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the agency's major plans have come to fruition since the last inaugural 
parade in 1981. (Ronald Reagan's 1985 parade was canceled because of bitter 
cold weather.) Many feel the street has never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the beauty of the boulevard, there is also a lingering sadness. On a 
normal day, the homeless roam up and down the street. One man has set up a 
permanent residence of sorts, a configuration of plastic and cardboard, right 
in front of the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. 
His scrawled sign proclaims him to be a war veteran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless to Be Removed 
</P>
<P>
On parade day, the homeless will be removed from the avenue, though police have 
refused to discuss their plans for how this will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes, on the inaugural march, will pass between the J. Edgar Hoover FBI 
Building on their right and the Department of Justice on their left. The chunky 
FBI Building may not be pretty but it's one of Washington's most intriguing 
tourist attractions, especially the display of the "10 Most Wanted" criminals 
list. 
</P>
<P>
To spruce up the sprawling FBI building's Pennsylvania Avenue facade, the 
development agency is installing panels with eight life-sized figures of George 
Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Abraham 
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office development, 1001 Pennsylvania Ave., will pop into view 
next. The 785,000-square foot facility includes a central atrium and 
incorporates a number of old architectural facades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saved from Wrecking Ball 
</P>
<P>
On the left is a building that dominates this area of the avenue, the 
Romanesque-style Old Post Office Building, whose soaring observation tower 
brought it the nickname "Old Tooth" and made it the tallest building in 
Washington. Preservation groups had to fight to save it from the wrecking ball 
before an enormous restoration effort turned the building into a shopping 
gallery and 10-story office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the Old Post Office is the Evening Star Building, built 
in Washington's Beaux-Arts style to house the afternoon newspaper. Its finely 
detailed white marble facade is being spruced up as part of a rehabilitation 
project that eventually will contain 212,000 square feet of office and retail 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office complex appears next, across from the massive Federal 
Triangle office building complex. The Bushes then pass yet another park, 
renamed Freedom Plaza in 1988 in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A block 
long, Freedom Plaza is one of the major public spaces on the avenue and is the 
first of three parks spanning the next three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Freedom Plaza, the Bushes can see a brand-new shopping, hotel and 
office complex, and the restored National Theater. Washington's oldest theater, 
it first opened in 1835 and reopened in 1984 after a major face lift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Held Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The next block contains Pershing Park and just beyond it, the dazzling, 
renovated Willard Hotel and Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln held occasional staff meetings in the Willard lobby. Franklin Pierce, 
Calvin Coolidge and Harry S. Truman all stayed in the hotel, where King wrote 
his "I Have a Dream" speech and where guest Julia Ward Howe wrote the words to 
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" on hotel stationery. 
</P>
<P>
Howe might have written another battle hymn if she could have looked into a 
crystal ball and seen the coming of the 1989 inaugural prices. The Presidential 
Suite, which has been rented out this week and includes a separate dining room, 
a grand piano, four-poster king size bed and a spa, goes for $2,300 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The parade route then makes a right turn where Pennsylvania is rerouted to jut 
around the White House, passing the giant Treasury Building and Garfinckel's 
Department Store before taking a left back onto Pennsylvania Avenue, now in 
front of the White House grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street will be Lafayette Square, a large park that has become the 
parking spot for protest groups a lunch spot for office workers and home to 
many homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The parade ends just past the White House, and the Bushes then can move into 
their new home.

   International Business Machines Corp., which for years
resisted the nickname "Big Blue," is now fighting for
exclusive use of the moniker against a little company that
claims the name for itself.
   The smaller company, six-person computer and software
distributor Big Blue Products Inc., won the first round of
the battle recently when the federal Trademark Trial and
Appeal Board refused to cede the title to IBM. The board is a
branch of the federal Patent and Trademark Office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The board said an administrative trial would be needed to
determine whether the public or the trade had come to
associate the nickname with IBM's typewriter ribbons or other
products. If not, Big Blue Products, of Northport, N.Y.,
apparently would be allowed to keep its name.
   The dispute centers around IBM's 1989 application to
register Big Blue as a trademark for a new line of typewriter
ribbons. Big Blue Products opposed the registration,
contending that it had used the trademark since 1984,
although it had not registered the name. The Patent and
Trademark Office has not yet agreed to register the name to
either company.
   IBM maintains in its court papers that it has the superior
claim to the name, because "since the 1960s the nickname BIG
BLUE has been used publicly by the trade, by the news media
and by the general public to identify IBM." To support its
claim, IBM submitted more than 500 newspaper and magazine
articles where the term "Big Blue" was used in association
with the computer giant.
   Big Blue Products argued that the articles failed to show
that the public identifies the nickname with IBM. It also
pointed out that IBM had for many years objected to the
reference, considering it a derisive reference to the
company's size and power. The nickname apparently referred
originally to the color of IBM's large mainframe computers.
   In its opinion early this month, the board said it
recognized that a company may have a protectable right in the
use of a nickname, even though it hasn't capitalized on it.
But it noted that "the use by the public of a term to refer
to a company and/or its products or services does not mean
that the company has obtained rights to exclude others from
using the same term for any product or service, and it
certainly does not mean that the company has obtained rights
to register the term as a mark for any product or service."
   About two years ago, the computer giant began a campaign
to protect the name by pursuing legal action against
imitators, while trying to register Big Blue with the Patent
and Trademark Office. After talks with two companies -- a New
York winery and a Louisiana computer company -- IBM agreed to
leave them alone, as long as there was no confusion about
which company marketed the products, an IBM spokesman said.
   Patent lawyers say the nickname doctrine recognizes that a
company has a protected right in a nickname, even though it
has done nothing to promote the name. What is key is that the
public associates the name with a particular company and that
confusion would arise if another company uses the same name,
they say.
   Roger Schechter, a trademark professor at George
Washington University's National Law Center, says that over
the years companies have won the right to protect nicknames
like Coke (Coca-Cola Co.), Bud (Budweiser), Met (Metropolitan
Opera), HOJO (Howard Johnson), HOG (Harley Davidson Inc.) and
Bug (Volkswagen AG). "Can you market a brand of french fries
called Golden Arches?" Mr. Schechter asked rhetorically.

   MERRILL LYNCH sues three former employees over alleged
bribery scheme.
   In the suit, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. accused two former vice
presidents, a former construction manager and several
construction contractors of a kickback scheme involving the
construction of the company's headquarters at World Financial
Center in Manhattan.
   The two former vice presidents, Albert Young and John
Serino, pleaded guilty in November to criminal charges in
connection with the alleged scheme.
   In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Merrill
Lynch said that its in-house investigation is continuing, and
that it may add other defendants to the suit.
   The suit accuses Messrs. Young, Serino and Robert Fraser,
the construction manager, of receiving hundreds of thousands
of dollars in illegal bribes and kickbacks from the
contractors and suppliers. In return, Messrs. Young, Serino
and Fraser are accused of arranging for the companies to get
work on the project.
   Merrill Lynch said the alleged scheme resulted in the
company's paying inflated prices for the construction. The
company said in the suit that the scheme began in 1985 and
involved cash bribes handed over secretly in bathrooms and
stairways. The suit also alleged that Mr. Young used a secret
Bahamian bank account to funnel some of the payments he
received.
   The suit seeks unspecified total damages, including the
return of all compensation paid to Messrs. Young, Serino and
Fraser during the alleged scheme.
   Attorneys for Messrs. Young, Serino and Fraser couldn't be
reached for comment.

   LEBOEUF LAMB opens office in Moscow despite turmoil in
Soviet Union.
   LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp; McRae, a 425-lawyer firm based in
New York, has set up a Moscow office headed by James I.
Mandel. At least five other U.S. law firms have Moscow
operations.
   John I. Huhs, New York-based head of LeBoeuf's Soviet and
Eastern European practice group, said the firm is making a
capital investment in Moscow because Western companies
continue to want to participate in Soviet joint ventures,
despite economic and political turmoil.
   He said companies the firm represents are "getting their
feet wet" with modest investments of $5 million to $10
million in such wide-ranging enterprises as a consumer-goods
factory, a brick-manufacturing plant and a sound-recording
studio.

   BASEBALL STAR Joe Morgan's award against Los Angeles
police upheld.
   A federal judge approved a $540,000 jury award to baseball
Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, who sued the department after a
policeman allegedly roughed him up three years ago at the Los
Angeles International Airport. The award, reached at the end
of a trial last February, included $450,000 in punitive
damages against the officer.
   Mr. Morgan said he was waiting for a connecting flight
when he was grabbed, thrown to the ground and handcuffed by
officers who claimed he resembled a suspected drug courier's
companion. In his suit the former player claimed that his
civil rights were violated and that officers harassed him
primarily because he is black.
   The ruling by Judge Mariana Pfaelzer comes at a time of
controversy about police brutality in Los Angeles in the
aftermath of the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King
last month. On Friday a Los Angeles Superior Court jury
awarded about $8.8 million in damages to another man, wounded
in 1987 by an off-duty police officer. That award is believed
to be the highest police-related damage assessment in city
history.
   An attorney for the Los Angeles Police Department said it
will appeal.

   NOTED: David Andrews was appointed managing partner of the

the lead partner in McCutchen's environmental group, he was a
regional counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

   Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for
her campaign to unseat Nebraska Democratic congressman Peter
Hoagland. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski for a return visit to Omaha.
   The former Illinois congressman said Monday that Milder's
concern was ``understandable'' in the aftermath of his reference to
illegal aliens as ``wetbacks,'' a remark he conceded was ``a dumb
mistake.''
   ``There's no place in government for people who have attitudes
like this,'' said Milder, who said it was up to President Bush to
decide whether the remark was enough to force the Cabinet secretary
to resign.
   ``We're not going to comment,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Milder wouldn't discuss the incident which occurred Friday
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend.
   ``That's certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of
the word,'' said Kent Grisham, a spokesman for the Nebraska
Republican Party. ``I think she made an interesting point that
being Jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice first-hand.''
   Riccardo Correa, an Omaha businessman who is active in Hispanic
affairs, said Derwinski's remark had not altered his long-standing
support for Milder.
   Correa said her apology was ``not for people like me but for
people who would use this against her.''
   Hoagland won the Omaha congressional seat in 1988 by a margin of
fewer than 3,000 votes, succeeding Republican Hal Daub who ran for
the Senate.
   Howard Schloss, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign
committee, called the Hoagland-Milder contest ``a very tight race''
and he relished the opportunity to link Milder to Derwinski.
   ``It showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out
there in the first place,'' he said. Calling Derwinski
``insensitive not only to minorities but to women,'' Schloss said
Milder ``brought him out there regardless of his views on these
matters.''
   Derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the Cabinet
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as
``Little Miss Coffee Maker,'' ``Zsa Zsa,'' ``Little Miss Muffett''
and ``Lena.'' He also has nicknames for several male aides.
   Derwinski said the nicknames were part of his policy of running
``a completely informal office.''
   He called it ``just one of my efforts to have one great big
happy family on my staff.''
   Derwinski aides refer to him as ``The Big Cheese.''
   Sandy Peyton, a program assistant at the Department of Veterans
Affairs, said Derwinski calls her ``Miss America,'' and ``I don't
mind at all being called that.''
   Peyton said there was ``a good warm atmosphere'' in the office
and that the women employees ``were all livid'' to read a story
suggesting they were offended by the secretary's habit of giving
them nicknames.
   Derwinski said his use of the term ``wetback'' was ``just one of
those dumb slips ... that law of averages you have them, I guess.''
   He said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs.
   ``I just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is
they're so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in
the long run was the way we had to go,'' he recalled. ``And then I
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking
of exactly what I said, I said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks
to get drugs into the country.''
   He said he hadn't realized what he said and ``the first
opportunity I apologized ... I said, obviously, it was a dumb
mistake. ... It was an inadvertent, almost unconscious comment.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ephemeral, clean'' blue will signal the brash
new fashion statement of traffic agents, long saddled with the
nickname ``Brownies'' because of their oh-so-drab uniforms.
   ``Brown looks dirty; it seems to remind you of congestion,'' said
Joe DePlasco, spokesman for the city Department of Transportation.
   And so on Friday, at ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of
the traffic enforcement division, the department will reveal all _
via mannequins adorned with uniforms past, present and future.
   Much has changed since June 1, 1960, when the city sent forth its
first corps of so-called ``meter maids.''
   That all-woman ticket-writing force wore white blouses, navy blue
skirts and scarves, black kid pumps and a hat modeled after that
worn by the era's airline stewardesses. A men's version was created
when the force went co-ed in 1967.
   In 1974, the duds du jour became a brown skirt or pants; brown
jacket and overcoat; brown shoes; brown tie and white shirt.
   You might say that brown became all the rage after that. In
recent years, the color has become to some belligerent motorists
what red is to a bull.
   ``There is a lot of Brownie bashing that is going on in the
streets,'' said DePlasco. ``We'd like to change the image that
traffic agents can be abused by the public.''
   In the first four months of 1990, 167 traffic agents were
assaulted or otherwise confronted by unruly motorists; in the same
period last year, the number was 114.
   Besides, says DePlasco, the Brownies _ er, traffic enforcement
agents _ found their nickname to be pejorative. They hope the new
garb will signal a new era of respect.
   ``We think the uniform could give a greater sense of pride, would
be cleaner, look nicer, make the person feel happier about
themselves and win more respect from the public,'' said DePlasco.
   The city's 1,900 traffic agents will phase in the new look, using
their $480 a year uniform allowance.
   It will feature a navy blue hat, white shirt, navy blue tie, navy
blue jacket, gray trousers with a navy stripe and black shoes. A
committee is being formed to add the finishing touches, and the
final creation is expected by fall.
   ``We're willing to take suggestions from renowned New York
fashion designers,'' said DePlasco.

A Navy commander, engaging in unusually frank public criticism, said the U.S. 
warship Vincennes that shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290 people, had 
been given the derogatory nickname "Robo Cruiser" for its aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. David R. Carlson of the frigate Sides, which was in the Persian Gulf at 
the time of the July 3, 1988, downing, wrote in the September issue of the U.S. 
Naval Institute magazine Proceedings that the aggressiveness of the Vincennes, 
commanded by Capt. Will Rogers III, was well known among naval officers in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the 
incident, my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her 
long suit," Carlson wrote. "Her actions appeared to be consistently aggressive 
and had become a topic of wardroom conversation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unamusing Nickname' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Robo Cruiser' was the unamusing nickname that someone jokingly came up with 
for her, and it stuck," Carlson wrote. "My guess was that the crew of the

anti-aircraft system on the cruiser) in the Persian Gulf and that they hankered 
for the opportunity to show their stuff."

Carlson wrote that the Vincennes started a sea battle with Iranian gunboats 
earlier in the day in response to what may have been nothing more than warning 
shots from the boats feeling threatened by the cruiser's helicopter.

When the Iranian airliner came along later, the crew of the Vincennes 
misidentified the plane as an Iranian F-14 fighter jet and shot it down, though 
the Sides' radar showed the craft to be climbing and to be "a non-threat."

"The Vincennes announced her intentions to take TN 4131 (Track No. 4131, the 
Iranian airliner) with missiles at 20 miles. I wondered aloud in disbelief, but 
I did not do the one thing that might have helped. I did not think to push for 
a reevaluation of IFF (identification of friend or foe)," Carlson wrote.

   Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for
her campaign to unseat Nebraska Democratic congressman Peter
Hoagland. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski for a return visit to Omaha.
   The former Illinois congressman said Monday that Milder's
concern was ``understandable'' in the aftermath of his reference to
illegal aliens as ``wetbacks,'' a remark he conceded was ``a dumb
mistake.''
   ``There's no place in government for people who have attitudes
like this,'' said Milder, who said it was up to President Bush to
decide whether the remark was enough to force the Cabinet secretary
to resign.
   ``We're not going to comment,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Milder wouldn't discuss the incident which occurred Friday
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend.
   ``That's certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of
the word,'' said Kent Grisham, a spokesman for the Nebraska
Republican Party. ``I think she made an interesting point that
being Jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice first-hand.''
   Riccardo Correa, an Omaha businessman who is active in Hispanic
affairs, said Derwinski's remark had not altered his long-standing
support for Milder.
   Correa said her apology was ``not for people like me but for
people who would use this against her.''
   Hoagland won the Omaha congressional seat in 1988 by a margin of
fewer than 3,000 votes, succeeding Republican Hal Daub who ran for
the Senate.
   Howard Schloss, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign
committee, called the Hoagland-Milder contest ``a very tight race''
and he relished the opportunity to link Milder to Derwinski.
   ``It showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out
there in the first place,'' he said. Calling Derwinski
``insensitive not only to minorities but to women,'' Schloss said
Milder ``brought him out there regardless of his views on these
matters.''
   Derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the Cabinet
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as
``Little Miss Coffee Maker,'' ``Zsa Zsa,'' ``Little Miss Muffett''
and ``Lena.'' He also has nicknames for several male aides.
   Derwinski said the nicknames were part of his policy of running
``a completely informal office.''
   He called it ``just one of my efforts to have one great big
happy family on my staff.''
   Derwinski aides refer to him as ``The Big Cheese.''
   Sandy Peyton, a program assistant at the Department of Veterans
Affairs, said Derwinski calls her ``Miss America,'' and ``I don't
mind at all being called that.''
   Peyton said there was ``a good warm atmosphere'' in the office
and that the women employees ``were all livid'' to read a story
suggesting they were offended by the secretary's habit of giving
them nicknames.
   Derwinski said his use of the term ``wetback'' was ``just one of
those dumb slips ... that law of averages you have them, I guess.''
   He said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs.
   ``I just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is
they're so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in
the long run was the way we had to go,'' he recalled. ``And then I
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking
of exactly what I said, I said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks
to get drugs into the country.''
   He said he hadn't realized what he said and ``the first
opportunity I apologized ... I said, obviously, it was a dumb
mistake. ... It was an inadvertent, almost unconscious comment.''

   Minnesota's education commissioner is
urging schools to drop Indian nicknames, but an Indian leader says
that's not necessarily a good idea.
   ``If your school district has an Indian mascot, emblem or symbol,
please report your progress toward removing them,'' Commissioner
Ruth Randall and state Board of Education president Marjorie Johnson
said in a letter this week.
   They called the names ``offensive to persons of American Indian
culture'' and reminded districts of a board resolution adopted last
year encouraging removal of Indian mascots.
   But Chip Wadena, president of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and
the White Earth Indian Reservation, criticized the board for not
consulting tribal officials.
   Wadena and other Indian leaders said Tuesday that they want the
right to keep such mascots when the schools' students are
predominantly American Indian. They also said that Indian themes are
not a problem if handled with respect.
   Wadena said the White Earth tribal council is supporting the
Mahnomen School District, which is within the reservation, in
retaining its ``Indians'' nickname. About 38 percent of Mahnomen
High School students are Indian.
   But Phil St. John, a member of Concerned American Indian Parents
who has led a campaign against using Indian names as mascots, said
such names are derogatory and portray Indians in ``an animalistic,
warlike image.''
   Last month, the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue
50 public schools for civil rights violations if they don't change
their Indian mascots.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Pangs of delight for Hong Kong cartoonists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A hairdresser recently asked her view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new
governor, furrowed her brow and said: 'Hmmm, Mr Patten; a very important
man.'
'Why?' 'Well, he's the chairman of Britain. Hong Kong is lucky to have such
an important man.'
The former chairman of the Conservative party might be taken aback by his
elevation, but then, to the Chinese, the word 'chairman' has a singular ring
to it.
An altogether different grassroots perception of the new governor is
provided by cartoonists in the leading local newspapers. They have lighted
on Mr Patten's somewhat corpulent demeanour and nicknamed him 'Fat Pang' -
Pang being the Chinese surname he has taken.
This is not a case of lese majeste as such - the Chinese will pick on
someone's most distinguishing feature be it a stammer, squint or limp and
turn it into a nickname - but more a piece of well-intentioned and
irreverent teasing.
But it is a nickname the governor will have to live with for the rest of his
time in Hong Kong. One newspaper, the Hong Kong Economic Journal, has begun
to run a daily comic strip entitled 'Fat Pang's Theatre'.
Mr Patten's desire to run an 'open and accessible' administration - one
element of which will be a form of prime minister's questions in the local
legislature - will no doubt provide fertile material for the colony's local
wags.
So may his desire to run a 'presidential' style of government. Yesterday, he
held one of the largest press conferences the colony has seen in the garden
of his official residence. It was not quite the White House Rose Garden, but
the tone was unmistakable. Mr Patten intends to lead from the front.

   There is substantial evidence to indicate that your
labeling of Martin Van Buren as "a member of the Northeastern
Establishment" was erroneous ("Martin Van Bush," Review &amp;
Outlook, Nov. 7). No less an authority on the administration
of Jackson and Van Buren than a member of your own editorial
Board of Contributors, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., has shed
much light on this matter. In his book "The Age of Jackson"
Mr. Schlesinger devotes more space in the index to Martin Van
Buren than to any other person mentioned in the book except
Jackson.
   If there is one main theme that characterizes the
Establishment it is the close relationship between government
and banking, money creation, borrowing, lending, interest
rates and legal-tender laws. If there is another, it would be
the Establishment's advocacy of government aid to private
corporations. In his index, Mr. Schlesinger refers the reader
to Van Buren's positions on numerous issues by page number.
For example: "opposes government aid to private corporations,
58" and "supports hard money, 115, 126." These two positions
alone place Van Buren well outside the camp of the
"Northeastern Establishment."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Van Buren was born in Kinderhook, N.Y., and was given the
nickname "Old Kinderhook." From that nickname came the
expression "OK," the initials Van Buren scrawled on
documents. It has become the most universal word in any
language meaning approval. Martin Van Buren was indeed OK.

   What flagrant exhibitionism, what terrible
identity crisis, what suicidal yearnings would compel a middle-aged
man to wriggle into a woman's dress and brave the taunts of 56,000
howling fans at a Washington Redskins football game?
   Michael Torbert stood thoughtfully at his front-row seat at the
50-yard line at RFK Stadium. He fluffed his bright yellow tresses,
smoothed the wrinkles from his polka-dot skirt and sniffed through
his plastic hog snout.
   ``Hey, priests have been wearing dresses for years, right?'' he
said. ``We just add a little color.''
   Torbert and his pot-bellied buddies are familiar to millions of
TV football viewers as the ``Hogettes,'' the unofficial Redskins
cheerleaders who go hog-wild every Sunday afternoon in gaudy wigs
and skirts, floppy hats and pink snouts.
   ``Our designer is Calvin Swine,'' says Ralph Campbell, who wears
a bleached-blonde wig and ruffled yellow dress with red Hogette
sash across his ample waist. A retired Navy helicopter mechanic,
he's known as ``the pretty one.''
   These bearded bimbos have nicknames like ``Pork Chop'' and ``Big
Georgette'' and ``Peewee.'' They boast an average weight of 243
pounds, nurtured by plenty of hot dogs and beer. They like to chew
on huge plastic cigars.
   And when the Redskins are rolling toward a touchdown, they wave
their parasols and hoist their beefy legs over the railing,
bellowing encouragement.
   Torbert organized the Hogettes in 1983 to lead cheers for the
``Hogs,'' the nickname of the Redskins' offensive linemen, and to
raise money for their favorite children's charities.
   The Hogettes range in age and occupation from a 28-year-old mail
carrier to a 59-year-old retired civilian employee of Army
intelligence. Torbert, 45, an Energy Department engineer and
longtime Redskins fan, said all the Hogettes are devoted fathers
and civic activists.
   Since 1983, he said, the Hogettes have helped raise $30 million
for sick and underprivileged children by appearing at golf
tournaments, telethons, parades and other charity benefits at their
own expense.
   Each of the 11 regular Hogettes spends as much as $1,000 out of
pocket to attend Redskins games and log about 5,000 miles traveling
to more than 100 fund-raising events every year, Torbert estimated.
   Their 17 beneficiaries include Children's Hospital in
Washington, the Ronald McDonald House and a rural Virginia summer
camp for young cancer patients.
   ``I didn't have a dress in my closet for the first 40 years,''
said George Maxfield, alias ``Big Georgette.''
   ``My mom didn't raise me that way. But I'd do anything to raise
money for these kids,'' he said.
   Campbell, who's nickname is ``Grandpa,'' says he has no qualms
about looking foolish in a woman's skirt, ``if it brings smiles to
the kids' faces and makes some money for the sick ones.''
   The Hogettes have stolen dresses from their mothers' closets and
learned how to drink beer without getting their hog snouts wet.
   They've been pelted with ice and game programs. They've had
their snouts pulled back and snapped in their faces. Shouts of
``You're mighty cute!'' and ``What are you doing after the game?''
are commonplace.
   They take personal bodyguards when they travel to Philadelphia
to protect them against violence. ``We know how the Israelis feel
when we attend an Eagles game - four of us surrounded by an armed
camp,'' Torbert said.
   The Hogettes have endured not only icy stadium winds but more
than a few surprise pinches on their tushes from playful fans.
   Maxfield, who stands 6-feet-4, remembers a particularly painful
grab at the Hogettes' first Super Bowl at Tampa, Fla., in January
1984.
   ``I was going up into the stands for lunch when somebody hogged
down on my right cheek big-time,'' he said. ``I swung around, and
it was a woman who must have been at least 7 feet tall.
   ``She said, `I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.' I said, `If it
turns you on, feel free.' So darned if she didn't do it again -
real hard - and I almost went to the emergency room to see if she'd
torn a chunk out of me.''

<TEXT>     Clyde Bellecourt, director of the American Indian Movement, said there
would be protests outside RFK Stadium in an effort to get the NFL club to
change its name.;   "It's a bad part of this whole stereotype of Native
Americans," said Bellecourt, who has led protests outside the Metrodome in
Minneapolis to protest the Atlanta team's nickname and Braves fans' habit of
waving imaginary tomahawks. "Indians are people, and we don't want to be
mascots anymore for America's fun and games.";   Head said: "Generally, we do
the lobbying, and others, like A.I.M., do the protesting. We will work
together.";   The Redskins have rebuffed similar protests in the past, most
recently in 1988, when the Congress of American Indians complained that the
team's nickname was offensive.;   Although the term "Redskin" is considered by
many Native Americans to be pejorative, officials with the NFL team insist
that the team's insignia -- featuring an American Indian dressed in battle
headgear and war paint -- stresses the proud, strong heritage.  </TEXT>

   ``Lardy'' and ``Jughead'' know one of the
first rules of rural politics in Kentucky: Don't get too uppity
with the folks that put you in office.
   They are among more than 200 candidates in primary elections
today who have chosen to put their nicknames on the ballot.
   A name with quotation marks in it is the great equalizer, said
Flatwoods Mayor T.L. ``Lardy'' Groves, 71, who is running for
Greenup County judge-executive.
   ``Anytime you got (a nickname), it brings you down on the same
level with the ol' country boys out in the county,'' Groves said.
``They say, `He's not one o' them big shots.'''
   Besides, almost nobody knows him by his real name. Since Groves'
playmates named him ``Lardy'' at a swimming hole more than 60 years
ago _ ``I was a little, round boy,'' he said _ the label has stuck.
   Earl ``Jughead'' Mastin, 61, was born in Sardis, ``a little ol'
rough town'' in Mason County, he said.
   Mastin said his nickname comes from when he weighed less than
three pounds when he was born, but his head grew quickly. And the
townspeople dubbed him Jughead.
   ``That's an awful name, isn't it?'' he said.
   But he put it on the ballot.
   ``That's the way I'm known,'' he said.

   Cattle roundups do not appear anywhere in
the training manuals for city police officers.
   ``I don't think the academy prepared us for this,'' said Carl

   Rust and his partner, Dave Bardascini, were not the only ones
surprised to see the cows Saturday morning, wandering the streets

   ``At first I saw a couple of cows, and I thought I was seeing
something,'' said Nora DiCaprio, whose yard became an impromptu cow
pasture.
   The cows, owned by Joseph F. Korona of nearby Fort Johnson,
knocked down a pasture fence after being frightened by three dogs
and headed for the city, according to Korona's son, Joseph J.
Korona.
   Rust said he and Bardascini were dispatched to a city
neighborhood after police received a report of large animals
walking on the road.
   ``We got the call, and the dispatcher told us it was one cow.
And we turned the corner and it was about 20 to 22 cows,'' Rust
said.
   Rust said the cows began running through backyards and then
split into two groups, with about 13 of them heading for the
Amsterdam Municipal Golf Course.
   It eventually took the Korona family and some friends six hours
to round up the animals.

   It was no secret when two members of the
``Swamp Stompers'' motorcycle club tied the knot at the sixth
annual Dermott Crawfish Festival.
   Townspeople who were not on hand to see the wedding Saturday
likely heard about it.
   Before the wedding, the groom, Carey Rowland, 38, and the bride,
Helen Clemis, 33, rode around town on his Harley-Davidson
motorcycle followed by 100 other bikers.
   After Miss Clemis changed out of her blue denim biker attire
into a light blue wedding gown, the other bikers lined their big
choppers one across from the other in downtown Dermott, making a
long aisle that Miss Clemis walked down.
   The ceremony took about 45 minutes, said Justice of the Peace
James Scucchi, and was witnessed by at least 10,000 people
attending the festival in southeast Arkansas.
   Afterward, Rowland directed the bikers to rev their engines,
which they did, making them roar louder and louder each time.
   ``Oh, man, it was real loud. It was something,'' Scucchi said.
``The crowd just really got a kick out of it. Everybody said it was
the shortest, simplest and best wedding they had ever been to.''

   Fifty years ago in the Philippines, Resurreccion Florendo's parents had no trouble choosing her nickname. 
But today, their daughter faces big trouble because of their choice. 

   Mrs. Florendo's nickname is Sony. 
She and her husband, Gerardo, own and operate a modest restaurant in downtown Baltimore, plus a couple of fast-food outlets and a catering service, all doing business as "Sony's." 

   That fact has upset another -- and somewhat larger -- business: Sony Corp. of Japan. 
To the Florendos' dismay, the electronics giant has sued them in the federal courthouse a few blocks from the restaurant, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition and deliberate confusion of consumers. 
Sony wants Sony's to pay $300,000 in damages. 

   "Kalokohan!" responds Mrs. Florendo, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1968 and opened the restaurant in 1982. 
"I was Sony Florendo before there was a Sony Corp. 
What will happen to all the Resurrecciones, Asunciones and Corazones of my country who are nicknamed Sony?" 

   Sony Corp.'s trademark arrived in the U.S. in 1960. 
The company makes a habit of defending it aggressively, having won infringement cases against smaller businesses that sell everything from chocolates to bicycles. 
An attorney for Sony says the company's name has become so popular here that it "needs to be protected to avoid confusion." 

   But the Florendos' patrons don't buy that argument. 
"When I'm eating there, I never think of the other Sony," says Karen Salisbury, a longtime customer of the restaurant. 
"There's no confusion." 

   Some loyal patrons are so aggravated that they have mounted a counter-attack by writing letters, boycotting Sony products and setting up a legal fund for the Florendos. 
"Our goal is to protect our little Sony and put a dent in the reputation of the big Sony," says Bayani Elma, a restaurant regular who heads the boycott. 

   For her part, Mrs. Florendo says she has tried to compromise, but without success. 
She says the company rejects her idea of renaming the restaurant "Sony Florendo's" and instead insists she promise that, after she dies, her survivors won't use the name. 

   "That's too much," she says. 
"I'm an immigrant in this country with no roots. 
All I brought with me was my dignity, my principles and my name. 
My parents gave me that, not Sony Corp."

<HL> Here's a Solution: Kodak Could Just Change Its Name to Rakow </HL>
<AUTHOR> Clare Ansberry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EK </CO>
<TEXT>
   It's not easy for comedians to make a decent living these days. 
What with the sagging stock market and the current crop of presidential candidates, no one is in much of a laughing mood. 
So why is Eastman Kodak Co. giving D.B. Rakow such a rough time? 

   Because the Syracuse, N.Y., comedian performs under a nickname he's had for nearly 20 years -- Kodak. 

   And the photographic-products giant sees little humor in that. 
Indeed, Kodak (the company) has taken Kodak (the comic) to court; later this month a federal judge in Rochester, N.Y., is expected to hear arguments over who should get the last laugh. 

   Mr. Rakow -- already prevented by court order from uttering the K-word -- acquired the sobriquet in 1969, while serving in Vietnam. 
He won't say how he earned it, nor will he talk about the case in general. 
But war stories circulating in western New York suggest that either a small Kodak camera in his pocket deflected a bullet and saved his life, or that he took lots of pretend pictures with a Kodak camera. 

   Mr. Rakow has used the nickname professionally for eight years. 
It never posed a problem until last year when he appeared at a club in Rochester just down the street from Kodak's headquarters. 
The club marquee read "Kodak," and the company apparently didn't want anyone confusing the two buildings. 
It complained to Mr. Rakow and says that he agreed in writing to stop using its name. 

   So when the comedian, still sporting his familiar moniker, appeared recently at another Rochester club, Kodak filed suit and won a temporary restraining order barring Mr. Rakow from using his nickname. 

   Company officials worry that if Mr. Rakow uses the company's valuable trade name, others will do the same -- and soon it will lose its cachet. 
"We don't want to become another thermos or cellophane," says a Kodak spokesman. 
Moreover, the company fears people will associate it with Mr. Rakow, whose act, according to the suit, is "off-color" and "crude." 

   Walter Munson, Mr. Rakow's attorney, scoffs at this last notion. 
"There's no way he would be mistaken as a Kodak employee or representative," he says. 

   Still, the injunction against the comedian left Jeff Springut, owner of the Red Creek Inn in Rochester, not sure what to call Mr. Rakow during an appearance at the club last week. 
His solution: placing a sign in the club lobby that read, "Fuji or Polaroid or Something Like That."

   Actor Steve Guttenberg's wedding to model
Denise Bixler came much easier than his film marriage in ``Diner,''
in which his fiancee had to pass a football trivia test before he'd
marry her.
   ``No tests. Just true love,'' Guttenberg's publicist Jay
Schwartz said Monday.
   Guttenberg, 30, who also starred in ``Cocoon'' and the ``Police
Academy'' movies, married Ms. Bixler in a private, formal ceremony
Friday for a few family and friends in Plymouth, Mich.
   Ms. Bixler, who lives in Plymouth, wore a white wedding gown
with a long trail. Guttenberg wore a tuxedo with a white bow tie.
   Schwartz said he did not know the bride's age or how the couple
met.

   Looking dazzling, Horne attended a party Monday for her new

first record since ``The Lady and Her Music,'' the original cast
album of her 1981 Broadway show.
   ``They selected the songs,'' she said of the recording company.
   ``I think it's tough finding songs becoming to one of my
years,'' the 71-year-old singer said.
   She said her favorite songs on the new album are ``Roundabout,''
``Joy'' and ``Look to the Rainbow.''
   The album includes duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and jazz singer

name was an obvious choice.
   The couple already own two upscale restaurants in New York and
one in Dallas under the name Sam's Cafe. Sam is Stephen Crisman's
nickname for his actress wife and business partner.
   On Monday, the two announced plans to open a California-style
cafe aimed at young singles in the marketplace on Biscayne Bay. The
cafe will be named Zemos, which is Hemingway's nickname for her
husband.
   ``When the location became available, we jumped at it,'' said
Crisman, who managed the Hard Rock Cafe in London in the 1970s and
opened its New York branch in 1983.

   Combining work with protest, actor Martin
Sheen was among 110 people arrested at the Nevada Test Site on the
birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of civil disobedience.
   About 200 protesters gathered for the nuclear weapons protest
and observance of Gandhi's 119th birthday on Sunday, said Energy
Department spokesman Chris West.
   Many protesters were arrested more than once for crossing the
test site boundary repeatedly, West said. All were cited for
misdemeanor trespass.
   The Rev. Bill O'Donnell, a Catholic priest from Berkeley,
Calif., said Sheen brought along a film crew to shoot scenes for a
movie in which the actor plays a scientist exposed to nuclear
weapons. He said the demonstation was peaceful and called it ``just
typical civil disobedience.''
   Sheen has been arrested numerous times in demonstrations at the
site where underground nuclear weapons tests are conducted.
   Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1948, advocated passive
resistance as a means of ending British rule of India.

   Despite South Carolina claims, New York
City Mayor Ed Koch isn't convinced the ``Big Apple'' nickname was
picked in Columbia.
   Koch is willing to concede a dance called the Big Apple came
from Columbia, but he insists New York City's nickname was
home-grown.
   ``Big Apple,'' says Koch, was musicians' slang that came from
jazz circles in Harlem. Columbia Mayor T. Patton Adams claims the
name came from the ``Big Apple'' dance performed 50 years ago at a
nightclub of the same name in his city.
   Koch has bet a pizza; Adams is offering mustard-based barbecue
in a wager over the origin of the nickname.
   ``We're not disputing the story about the Big Apple dance. Does
it link up with the nickname? We're not sure,'' Koch spokesman
Larry Simonberg said Monday. ``If these people want to come up with
their evidence, we'd be glad to have them.
   ``Barbecue would be most welcome,'' Simonberg added. ``But we'd
rather have a couple of hitters for the Mets and just to be fair,
some pitchers for the Yankees.''
   The bet was sparked by a New York Times article Monday about the
Columbia claim.
   Adams believes he has a leg up. Documentation. Lots of it.
   The evidence, he says, includes newspaper and magazine articles,
photographs, oral histories of those who lived during the
Depression era _ including people who danced at the Columbia club
and those who danced the step on the stage of New York's Roxy
Theatre in 1937.

   Kansas may not have towering mountains,
but it isn't all flat. It now has a sinkhole that is fast becoming
a tourist attraction.
   It's also a menance, say officials of the state's Kansas
Corporation Commission. They warned people Monday to stay away from
the sinkhole so they don't fall in.
   The sinkhole in southwest Kansas is 300 feet across, 50 feet
deep and promises to get bigger.
   Since it was discovered July 21, six miles northeast of
Macksville, a steady line of lookers has streamed to the site.
People have crawled through the barbed wire to get a better view,
said Bruce Ney, a commission spokesman in Topeka.
   ``It's quite an attraction, unfortunately,'' Ney said.
   Corporation commission geologists estimate the sinkhole could
expand until its diameter reaches 800 feet. Geologists think it was
created when water from a leaking disposal well dissolved salt in a
formation 1,400 feet to 1,750 feet below ground.
   They say the roof of the cavern probably has been collapsing for
a number of years and the disintegration has now reched the surface.

   After a brief exposure, a nearly nude
billboard character is back with a change of clothes.
   Now there can be little doubt that the character, criticized by
some for appearing to be nude, is covered up. In a new sign
unveiled Monday, the man wears a bright red bikini bathing suit.
   ``The guy had a bathing suit before but it was hard to see,''
said Don Pierce, manager of Naegle Outdoor Advertising Co. in
Raleigh.
   Pierce said the company, which owns the three billboards in
Greenville on which the ad appeared, decided to change the sign
after talking with the advertiser and the advertising agency that
developed it.
   The original ads for the Carpet Bargain Center had the face of
an area television announcer imposed on a reclining body that was
clad in flesh-colored briefs.
   Greenville officials said they received about a dozen complaints
from people who thought the man was in the buff. But city officials
said the sign did not violate zoning ordinances or obscenity laws.
   Jeff French, a spokesman for the French Advertising Agency that
prepared the billboard, said Monday the billboards were done with
humor in mind and the advertisers didn't intend for it to be
controversial.

   ``A Bronx Tale,'' written and acted by Chazz
Palminteri, tells the story of a boy growing up with two father
figures, one of them a mobster.
   It's an interesting large anecdote, stuffed full of small,
fascinating, well-rounded anecdotes, containing both gritty
unpleasantness and light humor plus some moral points.
   The play, in which Palminteri takes a boy he calls Colognio from
age 9 through adolescence, opened Wednesday night at Playhouse 91
off-Broadway.
   Palminteri, who also plays 17 other parts, has learned well the
writer's lessons _ embroider on material you know and give your
story a beginning, middle and end. His ending wraps up every thread
in the story and is lavishly sentimental and it works.
   In this vividly populated Italian neighborhood in the Bronx,
nearly everybody has a nickname. In Little Johnny's bar, there's
Rudy Ice, who walks so smoothly it's like he skates on ice, and
Eddie Mush, a hard-luck gambler _ ``everything he touches turns to
mush.''
   Little Johnny, the top local mobster, makes young Colognio his
surrogate son and nicknames him C. Little Johnny tells C that the
working man is a sucker. The boy's father, an honest man who drives
a bus, says that Little Johnny is a bad man and that the working
man, who has a hard time getting up every day for work, is the real
tough guy.
   There are some surprises. When C complains to Little Johnny that
an acquaintance owes him $20 and is avoiding him, instead of Little
Johnny saying he'll rub him out, he says, ``It cost you $20 to get
rid of him. You got off cheap.''
   And there are some acting moments to be especially relished, as
C's youthfully awkward, pompous imitation of toughness and visiting
mobsters' sudden deference when they realize he is Little Johnny's
``boy.''
   In ``A Bronx Tale,'' C grows up learning from both men without
turning his back on either. The apartment house and bar-front set
and Little Johnny may be a little sugar-coated but there is murder,
fear and racial violence in ``A Bronx Tale.''

   On the 80th day of the Eastern Airlines strike,
picketing machinists, flight attendants and pilots at Logan
International Airport shared a picnic lunch brought by a fellow
striker.
   That kind of camaraderie, many Eastern employees say, has
boosted their spirits and determination as the bitter strike nears
the start of its fourth month.
   ``It's not easy but we're doing the best we can,'' Eastern ramp
service worker Bob Austin, 43, said Monday as he walked one of five
picket lines that operate daily at Logan.
   ``I'm not spending much. I haven't been to a store in two
months,'' Austin said. ``But I'm optimistic. I just hope the
airline will be sold in one piece.''
   Added 52-year-old pilot Ray Chumsae: ``I'm living on rainy day
money and so far there's been a lot of rainy days.''
   The local Machinists union has established a food and job bank
that many strikers have used to procure part-time work that allows
them to picket at least three times a week.
   ``We're still very solid and upbeat,'' said William Conley,
chief steward of the local Machinists. ``It helps to get all the
support. Our hope is to keep Eastern together.''
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors
since March 9, five days after the start of the paralyzing strike
by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York must approve a sale of
Eastern or any of its assets.
   ``This airline is not going to be sold in one piece, that's been
said over and over again,'' Eastern spokesman Steve Davis said.
``But for the strikers, it's a terrible situation. There's a
terrible human price being paid. We think it's awful.''
   About half of Eastern's 2,000 employees at Logan have joined the
walkout. On average, about 40 striking workers walk four-hour
shifts before being replaced by fresh pickets.
   The strikers exchange jokes as well as problems as they walk the
picket lines, which they have given nicknames.
   ``We talk about what's going on and all the things that crop up
because of this,'' said baggage handler Tom Hogan, 57. ``It's kind
of like a support group.''
   On Monday, strikers dined on pita bread sandwiches, potato chips
and soda on a blue-checked tablecloth spread on a grass island
adjacent to the Eastern terminal. They call the area ``Hollywood''
because it is the picket line of choice for television news camera
crews.
   ``There's a camaraderie about the whole issue,'' said B.J.
Phillips, 42, an Eastern flight attendant for 23 years who said she
was picketing at 6 a.m. on the strike's first day. ``People have
really pitched in for each other.''
   Phillips, who brought the picnic hamper, said some of the food
was donated by friends in her hometown of Carlisle.
   But despite the optimism, most of the strikers expressed anger
and frustration, much of toward Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air Corp., Eastern's parent company.
   ``Most of us here love our jobs but there's something terribly
wrong with the company,'' said 57-year-old pilot Bill Johansen, a
24-year Eastern veteran. People here have stuck together but
sometimes I'm amazed we've hung on.''

   Some soldiers being sent to the Persian Gulf have
their children at home to worry about. But Air Force reservist
Lorain Kuryla, who is nicknamed ``Grambo,'' also has her five
grandchildren.
   When the United States began sending troops to the gulf after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Kuryla _ an Air Force reservist
for 19 years _ didn't hesitate to answer a call for volunteers.
   ``This is what I've been trained for, and I'm glad for the
opportunity to serve my country,'' said Kuryla, who turns 63 on
Friday.
   ``In fact I feel better about going because I have no small
children at home to care for,'' she adds. ``I feel it will relieve
pressure from young mothers and fathers about being sent.''
   ``It's kind of weird to think of my mother with an M-16,'' said
her son, Michael Kuryla, 37. ``I can honestly say that my mother
wears combat boots.''
   Leaving behind her family in west suburban Hillside, Kuryla, a
master sergeant from the 928th Tactical Airlift Group, left O'Hare
International Airport on Wednesday, bound for the Middle East.
   Kuryla works in Air Force personnel and will be one of three
officers sent to the region to handle records, her son said.
   The grandchildren were the ones to come up with the ``Grambo''
nickname.

ALICE KAHN: HAPPILY, SHE'S DRIVEN TO MEMORIES

By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I remember what her face looked like in the delivery room mirror. I remember 
seeing her bouncing up and down in her Jolly Jump-Up. I remember her in that 
red, checkered party dress taking her first steps. 
</P>
<P>
I wiped her nose. I counted her toes. I changed her nondisposable diapers. And 
now, I am teaching my baby to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you go to practice driving?" my friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to the regional park," I said. "I figure if I'm going to die, I might as 
well do it in a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
Ju-u-u-st kidding, as my daughter Emma, now 15 1/2, would say. Actually, the 
odd thing is I don't feel frightened with my baby behind the wheel. I feel 
exhilarated. There are several reasons for this. 
</P>
<P>
One is that driving with my very own Student Driver is no more frightening than 
driving with myself. Not that I'm a terrible driver. I'm fine, really, once I'm 
on the road. My main problem has always been those darned parked cars that 
suddenly materialize while you're backing out of the driveway. You know, those 
little phantoms that are always ducking out of range of your rear-view mirror, 
taunting you with, "Hit us if you can." 
</P>
<P>
The second thing I like is that Emma driving represents a certain amount of 
freedom for me. Not only will I be off chauffeur duty for her, but she'll be so 
eager to get in the car that she'll end up driving around her younger sister, 
Hannah. Right? My days Driving Miss Hannah and being forced to listen to Paula 
Abdul are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason I like driving with Emma is that it gives us something to do 
together. It's a chance to heal whatever wounds remain from our boxing-kangaroo 
days of mother-daughter junior high hassles. And I like to be with her. She's 
fun. When she's driving, boys pull up to the car and wave. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, what I love is the look on her face when she's driving. You 
can see in her eyes when the light changes from red to green, the very gates to 
the universe open up. 
</P>
<P>
When she was little, we had so many nicknames for her. "Nucky" was the most 
common, short for Nucknose, short for Nucknosed Nuckersucker. She hated that 
one. "It's not even a common nickname," she complained once. "You know, like 
Snugglebunny." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, we called her "Sockeye," short for sockeye salmon. That came on a 
trip to British Columbia when she was 9 months old. She accidentally gave her 
dad a black eye by beaning him with her diaper-rash ointment jar after a 
wonderful salmon cookout. 
</P>
<P>
I won't tell you the names she's called me over the years. A sarcastic "Yes, 
Your Majesty" was one of the nicest. Then there was the time she threatened to 
write a tell-all biography of her mother, "Blankety-Blank, Dearest." 
</P>
<P>
But when I see her behind the wheel, I think of another nickname we gave old 
Sockeye, old Nucky, old Erma La Dooby. She used to have a rattle, one of those 
Educational Playthings-type things. Maybe your baby has one. It was a flower 
with a mirror in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
We used to call her: Flower-With-a-Face-on-It. And she really did look like 
that, wrapped in her blanket, with her peachy skin, her little black baby 
bangs, her tufts of curls around her ears. 
</P>
<P>
So today, when I see her maintaining an exact 25 on Spruce Street or executing 
a perfect left onto Cedar, I just kind of look at her and sit back and gasp. 
She's still my little Flower-With-a-Face-on-It coming into full bloom.

CRY IN THE WILD: THE TAKING OF PEGGY ANN
MONDAY AT 9,  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He's a mean, toothless, grungy killer.;    Not in real life, of course, but
in Monday night's NBC movie, "Cry in the Wild: The Taking of Peggy Ann," yet
another made-for-the-tube, based-on-a-real-story tale of horror.;    In this
case, although the action was shot in San Jose, Cupertino and Los Altos Hills,
it is supposed to be rural Pennsylvania, where in 1966 a 17-year-old girl was
grabbed by a mysterious mountain man and dragged through the woods for eight
days before authorities found them.;    I'm not sure why, 25 years later, we
need this particular story retold in the middle of the May ratings sweeps, but
then no one consults me about these things.;    If they did, I'd tell them we
need a kinder, gentler TV movie instead of all these crime stories.;    But
the thing about "Cry in the Wild" is, for what it is, it's not bad.;    Much
of it, actually, is fairly absorbing.;    Not entertaining or enjoyable, mind
you -- but absorbing.;    For one thing, it shows that David Soul can act, and
for those of us who lost track of him without Starsky or missed all those FBI
"In the Line of Duty" movies, that's something of a revelation.;    He seems
to have matured into a character actor of some weight, if his affecting
portrayal here is any indication. I guess you can't drive fast cars and
confess to People magazine about beating your wife your entire career.;   
Soul plays an FBI agent who enters the case after a young girl is snatched on
the way home from school with her friends.;    The kidnapping comes after two
years of terrorism in the town of Shade Gap, Pa., by a man (Morse) with a
shotgun who kept appearing out of nowhere and firing at people.;    "He's some
kind of peeping Tom," one investigator says, "except he likes to hurt
people.";    In addition to being crazed, he also turns out to be lonely,
which is why he grabs Peggy Ann Bradnick, sweetly played by Megan Follows of
"Anne of Green Gables.";    The kidnapper's name is Bill, but the kids on the
school bus, who had often seen him pathetically pedaling his bike, his hat
shoved over his face, nicknamed him Bicycle Pete, without knowing who he was.;
   "I've been planning this a long time; don't think I just did it," he tells
his last victim.;    When he goes on to exclaim, "You're mine," she asks, "Why
me?";    " 'Cause I love you," he confesses.;    But not only is he sick; he's
ugly.;    Clad in a dirty red hunter's cap and filthy coat, he's missing a
bunch of teeth, sporting hideous goggles and a buzz-saw haircut. If his
actions make him a monster, his appearance makes him look like one.;    He
bounces wildly from threatening to shoot the girl, smacking her around and
chaining her to a tree at night, to caring for her in his own warped way --
giving her his boots, for example, when she tears up her feet.;    At the same
time, the state police -- led by a hulking officer in the kind of role usually
played by Brian Dennehy but done here by big Dion Anderson -- and the FBI are
searching desperately for the two, hampered by driving rain. If he hadn't
stayed so close to home or come back to feed his dogs, they might not have
found him until it was too late.;    Although we know she must survive -- they
wouldn't make a movie like this if she didn't -- the script by Durrell Royce
Crays and the direction of Charles Correll (cinematographer on "Winds of War")
is surprisingly tense. It's hard not to get caught up in the plight of the
girl and root for her.;    Morse is so far removed from "St. Elsewhere," it
may be hard to think of him in the future as ever having played someone so
good.;    Bicycle Pete is not good, although there is an attempt here to
understand him. Peggy Ann Bradnick made that attempt, which may have saved her
life.;    "Nobody gave a damn," he tells her about his life before the
kidnapping. "Nobody.";    It's a pitiful declaration, and at that moment we
may have at least a little sympathy for this particular devil.;    Otherwise,
however, this is a nasty tale, even with its essentially happy ending.  </TEXT>

<F P=106> [Editorial by Nasrallah al-Dawudi: "The Accursed, </F>
Self-Contradictory One"] 
  [Text] The Iraqis have dealt with the accursed Ekeus with 
honesty and good will, avoiding the tricks of politics and the 
encroachments of the four big powers in the UN corridors. This 
has been intended to draw attention to the fact that we have 
frequently stressed, namely, that Iraq has fulfilled its 
commitments toward the Security Council resolutions. 
  This fact was confirmed in the statements made by the 
accursed Ekeus. These statements usually begin positively, and 
those concerned with politics and its secrets clearly understand 
such positive statements. Thus, the Security Council and its 
Special Commission should also clearly fulfill their commitments 
toward Iraq, lift the total embargo of its oil exports, and end 
the unjust blockade without resorting to a test period. This is 
because positiveness in international dealings means 
credibility. Throughout the joint work with the UN Special 
Commission, Iraq has been credible, particularly within the 
framework of building confidence, stemming from Iraq's 
international commitments and the maintenance of independent 
political and national decisionmaking. 
  Has the accursed Ekeus managed to move one step forward on 
the path of this positiveness, which remained the common 
denominator of all his statements before and after each round of 
talks held in Baghdad or at the UN headquarters? One who 
follows events sees the contrary and even senses a contradiction 
that evokes wonder and astonishment. Days after the talks 
ended, the accursed one ignored positiviteness and said 
something that satisfied the four big powers and stimulated the 
appetite of the agents, the defeatists, and their hired media 
trumpets run by Zionism. 
  The accursed Ekeus went back on his recent statements when 
he 
was received by the slaves of the Americans in the [Iraqi] 
governorate of Kuwait. Thus, positiveness turned into 
differences, and the tears he shed at the al-Rashid Hotel turned 
into greed for a handful of dollars. Ekeus wanted to ignite a 
fire and undermine Iraqi steadfastness. But, he did not realize 
that an Iraqi palm tree will not bow to storms. History will 
note that Ekeus has sold only the honor of his job, lost 
himself, and deserves a new nickname in addition to his previous 
nicknames. Mankind will recall Ekeus as an accursed and 
self-contradictory one. How bad are his nicknames and his loss 
of conscience!

<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Mike ``Mad Dog'' Roark
walked out of federal prison Wednesday after serving five months of
a cocaine possession sentence.
   Roark, 42, nicknamed for his flamboyant exploits as a
prosecutor, was whisked past reporters and photographers shortly
before 8 a.m. at the Federal Correctional Institute in Petersburg,
Va.
   Warden J.J. Clark said Roark refued to sign forms that would
have allowed him to be interviewed and prison officials to comment.
   A federal grand jury indicted Roark last July on 27
cocaine-related counts and three obstruction of justice counts.
   The one-time assistant U.S. attorney and Kanawha County
prosecutor pleaded guilty to six counts of cocaine possession Nov.
17 as part of a plea bargain and resigned as mayor Nov. 24, seven
months after he was elected to a second four-year term.
   He was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined $5,000.
   Roark entered prison Feb. 12 and was scheduled for release Aug.
8. He was a model inmate, which enabled the early release, a prison
official said.
   ``Obviously, he's presented no problems to us,'' Clark said,
adding that Roark worked as a clerk in the prison's education
department.
   Roark is to meet Aug. 1 with the State Bar Association, which is
trying to revoke his license to practice law.
   Roark earned the nickname ``Mad Dog'' for various reasons,
including an incident in which he donned a camouflage jacket and
sidearm for a drug raid.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bossi Tells The Knight: `Antitrust </F>
Measures Will Apply to You Too'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Despite their electoral agreement, [League 
Secretary] Bossi has never ceased making cutting remarks about 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. However, he has never 
before touched his ally's most sensitive nerve -- namely, his 
broadcasting empire -- so closely and, moreover, riding one of 
Forza Italia's own white horses. In fact, speaking in the town 
of Varese, the League leader said: "I will be very interested 
to see how the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] -- who speaks so 
much of liberalism -- reacts to what we will be saying about 
antitrust measures, when the League addresses the problem of 
competition. Liberalism," Bossi went on to explain, "cannot 
entail dominant economic positions, and therefore I will be 
interested to hear what Berlusconi has to say when we call his 
TV networks into question." 
  In his Varese speech, however, Bossi did not limit himself 
to 
attacking Berlusconi's "treasures." He also accused Forza 
Italia, once again, of being an instrument created by the 
establishment to try to weaken the League. Despite this, Bossi 
did not seem to be afraid of contradicting himself by asserting 
that "if Forza Italia does not betray us in any way, we will 
make room for freedom even in a Catholic-communist country such 
as Italy, where liberalism has never before taken root." 
  In any case, the Senator [Bossi nickname] is convinced that 
the League will be successful within the liberal-democratic 
coalition. Therefore "Forza Italia," he said, "which was 
launched by the DC [Former Christian Democratic Party] to 
destroy the League, is being used by us to destroy what is left 
of the old Catholic party." "This is why we entered into an 
agreement, but this agreement is only an electoral one." 
  In order to permit his supporters to swallow the pill of 
being asked to vote indiscriminately for all the "liberty" 
lists, including Forza Italia, Bossi explained that, in 
single-member constituencies, where the choice is 
"unfortunately" compulsory, 70 percent of the candidates will, 
in any case, belong to the Bandwagon [League nickname], and only 
30 percent will be Berlusconi's associates. "However, in the 
proportional vote," the Lombard leader emphasized, "you will be 
able to choose your political force, namely the League, and will 
not be forced to vote for Forza Italia, which was set up to 
rescue the establishment."
