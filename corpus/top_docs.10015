Sir, I very much enjoyed your 'Business Travel' (April 20), especially the
section on various 'airports of the world'. However, I have to say that Ms
Rawsthorn's report on Charles de Gaulle airport was typical of a certain
Anglo Saxon arrogant wit (whereas your other airport descriptions struck me
as being quite neutral), as well as a collection of all possible cliches you
may gather on France - the foie gras, the expensive clothes, the
Concorde-travelling top models, le 'glamour', quoi]
I must have flown into, and out of, Roissy a good 100 times over the past 10
years, and have never had to complain about my luggage being 'pillaged', not
even opened. As far as our 'sticky-fingered luggage handlers' are concerned,
they, too, probably would be happy to wear Chanel gloves to handle Ms
Rawsthorn's personal belongings.
Much to many people's surprise, France has less 'numerous national holidays'
than many other European countries (I have to admit, however, that the point
on public sector strikes was more relevant). And I honestly have to say that
I have never had 'to wait - and wait' for a bus at the RER station, whereas
I have been stuck at Acton Town for half an hour (at least) because of a
signal defect on a quite regular basis . . .
What Ms Rawsthorn needs, and must be eagerly awaiting, is the Chunnel. She
will be able to shop until she drops in downtown Paris, and then not have to
worry about struggling all the way to Charles de Gaulle. And then enjoy
frequent unexplained stops in the beautiful English countryside on her train
journey back to London. Bon voyage]

Like millions of people living in the south-east of England - and
particularly in my own county of Kent - I have never been a Channel Tunnel
enthusiast. This is not because the high-speed rail link, should it ever be
built, would go anywhere near my home. Put my feelings down to being an
old-fashioned reactionary. I liked Britain being a proper island and I have
always seen the Channel crossing by ferry as pleasure, not penance.
I doubt I was alone in hoping that if I ignored the Chunnel, it just might
go away. But new bridges began appearing across the M20 as it neared
Folkestone, while a forest of gantries and overhead wires went up behind
high concrete retaining walls. Work trains could sometimes be glimpsed.
When the first advertisements appeared for the Chunnel car ferry, which
starts running next May, I thought it was time I had a look. It was a
revelation. What has been built, unseen by M20 users, is something as big as
an airport terminal. But instead of acres of runways, there is a marshalling
yard and rail tracks running into a tunnel.
The operating company, Eurotunnel, says people still have many
misconceptions. Many think they will be able to drive their cars through to
France; and while most do realise it is rail only, some believe their cars
will go on flat trucks, as on car-carrier trains, while they ride in
passenger carriages.
Wrong again. You stay with your car in a windowless van. You can walk around
it if you wish, but the only place to visit is the lavatory in every third
interconnected coach.
When, in five months, the tunnel starts competing with the car ferries, this
is what will happen. Motorists will leave the M20 by the Eurotunnel slip
road, pause at a toll booth to pay for their passage, and then have a
choice. Those in a hurry can pass through Customs and drive straight on to
the train. Others can go to the terminal building for refreshments and
duty-frees.
Tickets can be bought from travel agents in advance but there are no
reservations; all-comers get in line for the next train. At peak times,
there will be one every 15 minutes; but if you just miss one at, say, 2am,
you could have to wait an hour or so.
Platform to platform, the under-Channel train will take 35 minutes.
Eurotunnel says that, during the day, a motorist should be able to drive out
of the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais, and on to the A26 autoroute
within one hour of coming off the M20.
There will be separate ferry trains for cars and commercial vehicles. Main
line passenger and freight trains will also use the tunnel but, apart from
sharing the tracks, have nothing whatever to do with the car ferry trains.
Fares have not been fixed but, to compete, they must be about the same as
those on the ships. Every safety and security precaution known to man has
been taken. Using Eurotunnel should be rather less risky than riding in a
clapped-out London Underground train.
Will it kill off the Dover-Calais ferries? Of course not, although it will
take a chunk of the available (and constantly growing) business of
transporting cars and lorries to and from mainland Europe. If the tunnel's
freight trains reduce the number of juggernaut lorries now pounding our
motorways to pieces, every motorist will cheer.
I have two reservations about Eurotunnel (which, beyond any argument, is a
wonder of 20th century civil engineering of which Britain and France can be
proud). While I do not exactly relish the thought of an underground - and,
even more so, undersea - journey of more than 30 miles (50 km), I shall
certainly try it. But the idea fills many people with such undiluted horror
that they say there is no way they will ever make the trip.
A more logical objection is that the time saving could be an illusion. The
train might take 35 minutes, platform to platform, against the ferry's 75
minutes, dock to dock. But you can eat, stretch your legs and shop during
the sea crossing. A family driving from, say, Birmingham to Paris would have
to stop for a meal before or after the tunnel crossing - so what has
happened to the time saving?
Many cross-Channel travellers, very sensibly, use the ferry as a mobile
motorway service area. So, with an eye on the Chunnel's opening, P &amp; 0 and
Stena Sealink have upgraded their fleets. The ships are now more like cruise
liners than ferries in size and facilities. They are so stable that even a
gale does not disturb their equilibrium - or, more important, that of their
passengers. For an extra Pounds 5 on each leg, P &amp; O club class is a truly
civilised way of crossing the Channel.
When heading west to Normandy and Brittany, I like using the longer routes
such as Newhaven to Dieppe; Portsmouth or Southampton to Le Havre, Cherbourg
or St Malo. Longer crossings are not always reflected in higher fares; a
four-hour Newhaven-Dieppe voyage can be cheaper than Dover-Calais.
Although the ships on these routes are not as large as the short-haul
super-ferries, their facilities are comparable, if on a smaller scale. My
wife and I have passed less comfortable nights in hotels than we did
recently between Portsmouth and St Malo on Brittany Ferries' 23,000-ton
Bretagne. It has every facility to make the eight-hour crossing pleasant;
even a hairdressing salon.
In Britain, Suzuki is synonymous with small four-wheel drives, and its Swift
front-wheel drive hatchback gets overlooked. It deserves better. I thought
the Swift GLX 1.3 automatic five-door, which I used as a runabout recently,
would suit many buyers whose motoring is mainly in town and who rate ease of
control above all else. The four-cylinder, multi-valve engine and
three-speed automatic gearbox are well matched. Power steering is
finger-light; central locking and a tilt-adjustable steering wheel are
standard; and the high-roofed body is agreeably roomy, with good all-round
vision. The ride can be bouncy on bad roads, and luggage has to be lifted
over a high sill. But, but at Pounds 9,125, the two-pedal Swift is cheaper
than any power-steered rival.

its own cheap flights look competitive. BA said air travellers could buy
return flights from London to Paris for Pounds 83, provided they travelled
in mid-week and stayed in the French capital over a Saturday night.
However, Mr Cris Rees, commercial manager at Thomas Cook, the travel agents,
said Eurostar could probably afford to charge a small premium because it
offered a convenient route from the centre of London to the centres of Paris
and Brussels, cutting out travel to and from airports. Mr Rees said
travelling by rail for the weekend would also be more appealing for families
than flying.
American Express, the financial services and travel group, said it welcomed
the added competition for London-Paris travel, the world's busiest air
route. The company said it expected Eurostar to win over travellers who
found it easier to travel to Waterloo station than to Heathrow airport.
American Express said: 'Commuters to Waterloo will just have to change
platforms to travel to Paris.' They would also be able to work more
comfortably on the trains than on an aircraft, the company said.
In the first few months of Eurostar travel departures will be limited to two
a day each way. Services will increase in frequency as more trains and
carriages are delivered.
Because of continued work on the tunnel by Eurotunnel, operator of the
cross-Channel link, there will be no Eurostar services on Saturdays and
Sunday mornings. But the Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon services will
allow travellers to spend weekends away.
Tickets will go on sale through Eurostar's telesales office, at main railway
stations and through travel agents.
The journey time between London and Paris is three hours and between London
and Brussels 3 1/4 hours. These times will fall when the Belgian and British
high-speed links have been completed.

For the regular air traveller between London and Paris, the Channel Tunnel
rail service is the answer to a jet-lagged dream. Farewell to the
interminable London Underground journey to Heathrow airport. Goodbye to the
air passenger in front whose seat is pushed back against your nose. No more
confused wanderings around the circular terminal one at Paris Charles de
Gaulle. Adieu to FFr250 taxi rides into central Paris.
While many travel agents expect the Eurostar railway service from London's
Waterloo station to Paris and Brussels to take business away from the
airlines, they say it will not appeal to everyone. And they are less
optimistic about the chances of the Le Shuttle car service taking business
from cross-Channel ferries.
The Eurostar service is expected to win business from the airlines,
particularly among business travellers. European Passenger Services, which
will run the trains, has indicated it will charge fares which undercut
airline prices.
Mr Simon Beeching, managing director of Wexas International, a club
organising business and leisure travel for its members, believes Eurostar
could win business even if it charged slightly more than the airlines.
'Everyone I've spoken to has said they like the idea of going by train. It
takes you from the heart of London to the hearts of Paris and Brussels,' he
says.
Mr Mike Platt, director of commercial affairs at Hogg Robinson Business
Travel International, says many of his customers have mentioned the
attractions of being able to sit around a table on trains between London and
the Continent, running through presentations or preparing for meetings -
something which is difficult to do on an aircraft.
For anyone living reasonably close to the centre of Paris or London,
travelling by Eurostar could take about the same amount of time as flying.
Door-to-door, a journey from a London suburb to central Paris is about four
hours. The Eurostar train journey between the two cities is expected to take
three hours; door-to-door travel will also be about four hours.
Mr Platt points out, however, that the Channel Tunnel rail service will not
be convenient for everyone. Many business travellers from London live in the
Home Counties and they might not be travelling to the centre of Paris. Mr
Platt says: 'If you're travelling from your office in London SW1 and going
to downtown Paris, the train is ideal. But it's not if you're going from
your home outside London to a factory outside Paris.'
The train service will also be up against one of the airlines' principal
attractions: frequent flyer points. Accumulating frequent flyer points has
become an obsession with many business air travellers, who use them to take
their holidays.
Business travel agents say that European Passenger Services should have no
difficulty developing attractive customer loyalty programmes. Paris and
London are popular tourist destinations for the British and the French
respectively. The opportunity to collect points towards a family visit to
either capital would be a strong incentive for many Eurostar customers.
If the attractions of the Eurostar services will be obvious to many, those
of Le Shuttle will be less so. Cross-channel ferries have succeeded in
recent years in making the journeys they offer more pleasant, with bright
decor, children's play areas, cinemas and better restaurants and shops.
Car shuttle services are expected to be relatively spartan, with travellers
remaining with their cars during the journey and the price of travelling by
shuttle will be higher than crossing by ferry.
But Mr Peter Shanks, retail commercial director at travel agents Thomas
Cook, points out the time advantage to travelling by shuttle. From motorway
to auto-route, travelling time by shuttle will be 60 minutes. By ferry, it
is 80 to 90 minutes.
Mr Shanks expects that by next year Le Shuttle will have 40 per cent of the
non-air, non-rail traffic, compared with 60 per cent for the ferries, and by
1996, 50 per cent.

PARIS PLEASURE 




A travel agent suggested a trip to Paris in early December. 


She said that Paris is beautiful at Christmastime and there would be no crowds 
as there are in summer, spring and fall. She was absolutely right. And there 
were no lines to wait in at either the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay. The French were 
friendly and helpful. Winter there was wonderful and I'll jump at the chance to 
do such a trip again.

in relation to the FT-SE-A All Share index (gross dividends re-invested) and
a 90-day Halifax building society account (gross income re-invested).
In fact, investors who have held on to their shares have done better than
the options. Return fares on Le Shuttle range from Pounds 220 to Pounds 310,
depending on the time of year the trip is made. If you had paid Pounds 350
to qualify for one return journey in the first year, and wanted to travel in
the most expensive period, you would have benefited to the tune of Pounds
327, allowing you to make another free trip.
The calculation assumes that Eurotunnel's price holds at Thursday's close of
348p. So, you would have paid Pounds 350 and got back Pounds 348.
There was a rights issue in 1990. If you had not taken it up, the value of
the nil-paid shares would amount to Pounds 35 for someone holding 100. Thus,
you made a 'profit' of Pounds 33 and got a trip worth Pounds 310. Since you
have to pay a further Pounds 16 for the journey, your total gain is Pounds
327.
You would have done less well by investing in a share matching the
performance of the All Share. Although the market has done well, turning
Pounds 350 into Pounds 875, paying for the Pounds 310 trip leaves a Pounds
215 gain.
The building society investor would have made Pounds 221 by depositing
Pounds 350 and getting back Pounds 571. But forking out for the Pounds 310
fare means he is out of pocket by Pounds 89.
Given the volatility of the Eurotunnel share price, shareholders cannot do
their sums until after their journey. The wiliest would have sold their
shares when the price reached a high of Pounds 11.64 in 1989. With Pounds
810 profit in hand, they could have bought a round-the-world airline ticket.

be a showpiece for the UK government's initiative of attracting private
capital to public infrastructure projects. It provides an opportunity both
to harness the private sector's skills in project management and to remove
at least part of a Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3bn project from the public sector's
balance sheet.
But to achieve these benefits, the Treasury will need to abandon its purist
line that all the risk of such projects should be borne by private
investors. Sticking to this line could delay or even kill off the project,
as Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary set up to develop the link,
will tell ministers later today.
The essential point is that the private sector is not well suited to bear
the political and regulatory risks associated with the early stages of large
infrastructure projects. Before construction on the Chunnel link can
proceed, planning consents must be won, public inquiries conducted,
legislation passed and safety standards determined. At each stage, there is
a danger that the project will be delayed and extra costs imposed.
This particular project does not start with a happy history as far as
private companies are concerned. Several construction groups have already
spent money making proposals, only to have them rejected largely for
political reasons. There is also the overhang from the main Channel tunnel
project, whose financial attraction has been reduced by a tightening of
safety regulations and the delay in building road and rail links.
It is doubtful whether private funds could be attracted at this stage and,
even if they could, a high risk premium would be required. Far better,
therefore, for the public sector to put up the Pounds 200m needed for the
project's next phase, tiding it over until political and regulatory
uncertainty is largely out of the way. After that, it should be easier to
find a further Pounds 2.5bn-plus from private investors. The remaining risks
 -concerning construction costs, operating expenses and customer demand -
are the type the private sector is best at managing.
Given the current budgetary pressures, it is reasonable to ask why the
Chunnel link should have priority over other worthwhile projects that are
now stalled. Part of the answer is that the link is already badly delayed.
Constructing it is important not only to maximise the economic benefits of
the Channel tunnel but also to ease congestion for commuter traffic in the
south-east.
But the most compelling reason for priming the pump is that a success with
Union Railways would give a boost to the government's private funding
initiative. It could open the door for private capital to flow into roads,
railways and prisons. That, more than almost anything else, would ease the
pressure on government finances.

'HELLO' AND 'BONJOUR' AS TUNNELERS MEET; 


ENGLISH CHANNEL: BRITISH AND FRENCH WORKERS KNOCK OUT A PASSAGE BIG ENOUGH TO 
WALK THROUGH, LINKING THE TWO SIDES OF THE 'CHUNNEL.' 




From Associated Press 




SANGATTE, France 




Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and 
French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a 
passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. 


"Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground," French 
President Francois Mitterrand said. "What a brilliant sign of the vitality of 
our two countries." 


The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to 
maintain two rail tunnels still being bored. It marked a symbolic milestone in 
Europe's biggest engineering project. 


Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 
37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the 
British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel." 


The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national 
flags. Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. 


"God save the queen!" cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. 


"Vive la France!" came the reply from the British side. 


Saturday's handshake came three years to the day after tunneling began at 
Sangatte, near Calais, and in Folkestone, England. 


The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to 
London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993. 


The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared 
with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry. 


Fares for the undersea crossing have not been set. But experts say the charges 
may be at least double the 1986 projections of $46 per person in a car and $19 
per train passenger. 


The tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of 
chalk with giant American-built boring machines, trying to align the two 
halves. 


The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when 
workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel. 


The connection ended Britain's island separation from continental Europe for 
the first time since the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago. 


Fagg and Cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent 
their countries in Saturday's meeting. After widening the passage from the size 
of a peephole to a window, they laid down their tools and shook hands. 


"Bonjour," boomed Fagg. 


"Hello," Cozette said, chuckling. 


Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation 
ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness 
the handshake. 


Fagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for 
Folkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night. 


Nine workers have been killed during the project. The cost has climbed from an 
initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion. 


The tunnel is viewed positively in France, where it is expected to revive 
economically depressed northern areas. But Britain has shown worry over the 
loss of its historic moat from the Continent. 


Many Britons fear drug traffickers or terrorists will invade their island via 
the tunnel.

MUCH OF the interest surrounding the opening of the Channel tunnel has
focused on the competition it will offer to the ferries. Yet the most
dramatic impact of the tunnel could be on business air travel between
London, Paris and Brussels.
If train services which run through the tunnel can emulate the success of
France's high-speed trains on the Paris to Lyons route, they could corner as
much as 80 per cent of passenger journeys.
Initially, two services will be available through the tunnel. Passenger
trains operated by European Passenger Services, trading as Eurostar, will
run from Waterloo to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels Midi. At the same time,
a shuttle service, known as 'le shuttle', and carrying cars and lorries,
will operate between terminals at Folkestone and Calais.
The shuttle service is due to start next May, beginning with two departures
an hour but rising to four an hour in the peak holiday season in August. The
journey will take one hour from motorway to motorway.
Travel agents do not expect large-scale business use of the shuttle service,
though businessmen who use their cars to carry exhibition materials or
samples are potential users.
European Passenger Services, a British Rail subsidiary, is still testing the
special trains it will run on the London to Paris/Brussels route and will
say only that it expects to start operations next summer.
The journey will take three hours to Paris and 3 hours 15 minutes to
Brussels. Track improvements in France and Belgium should cut the Brussels
times to 2 hours 40 minutes by 1996. The opening of the high-speed link
through Kent and East London in 2001, assuming there are no further delays
to the project, should cut journey times to Paris to 2 hours 30 minutes and
to Brussels to 2 hours 10 minutes.
When the high speed link is opened, the main passenger terminus in London
will move from Waterloo to either St Pancras or Kings Cross.
Passengers who do not want to go as far as Brussels or Paris can make use of
those trains which stop at intermediate stations. These are being built at
Ashford in Kent, Calais and Lille while further stations have been proposed
at Ebbsfleet, near Gravesend, Rainham in Essex and Stratford in East London.
In 1995 passenger services will be extended beyond London with night
services from Plymouth and Glasgow through the tunnel to the Continent.
Daytime services will operate from Manchester and Edinburgh. For travellers
who want to go beyond Paris and Brussels, there are existing rail
connections while high-speed links are being further developed. Further high
speed rail links are planned to come into use in France in 1994-95, skirting
Paris to link with the existing high-speed trains to Lyons and Bordeaux, and
in the Netherlands and Germany in 1988.
More than 40 trains will run in each direction every day and even at
off-peak times there will be at least one train an hour, Eurotunnel says.
There are also plans for overnight services linking London and other cities
in the UK with continental destinations.
'Once people get used to rail travel this could open up the rest of Europe,'
says Mr Paul Allen, chairman of the Guild of Business Travel Agents. 'To my
mind there is no choice when you can jump on a train, sit down at your seat
and get straight on with some work.'
The main advantage the train can offer over air travel begins before
boarding. For many travellers it is far simpler and quicker to travel to a
rail terminal in the centre of town than to an airport on the outskirts.
Flying frequently involves a long journey by taxi or underground to the
airport and a wait to board the aircraft. Take-off and landing delays caused
by congestion at airports can also prolong a flight.
The tunnel rail service will offer regular departures which should make
pre-booking unnecessary at many times of the day, though booking will
probably be necessary at peak times.
The tunnel should also offer a means of travel which is unaffected by the
weather, unlike autumn and winter airline flights which can frequently be
delayed by fog and ice.
For the nervous flyer the tunnel offers an alternative though questionnaires
of whether people would use the tunnel have revealed many travellers do not
welcome the prospect of a long journey in a tunnel. The time actually spent
in the tunnel will vary from 23 to 27 minutes.
Travel agents are generally enthusiastic about the benefits which the
Channel tunnel service will bring for customers. Just as the arrival of
competition in airline routes in Europe has brought down prices, so the
tunnel is expected to exert further pressure, says Ms Vanessa Leak, head of
marketing for Thomas Cook Travel Management.
But there are residual doubts about the delays in building a dedicated high
speed link in the UK and some travellers, disillusioned with the poor
commuter service provided by British Rail on some routes, may need
convincing that rail can be an attractive alternative.
'Our research suggests that the first few months will be crucial,' says Ms
Leak. 'We anticipate strong initial demand because of the novelty value. But
if travellers are in any way disappointed, it will be extremely difficult to
win them back.'
What is not yet clear about tunnel travel is the price of tickets.
Eurotunnel says prices will be announced in January, though it has said that
the shuttle ticket prices will be similar to ferry prices.
European Passenger Services says it will offer a range of prices which will
be competitive with the airlines. It expects to announce its fares structure
in the spring.
For businessmen who prefer to continue travelling by air, the opening of the
tunnel may also bring indirect benefits. Some travel agents are forecasting
that the cross-Channel routes will experience competition similar to that
which has prevailed on the North Atlantic air routes in recent years. These
have led to considerable price reductions and improvements in the quality of
the service offered.

   From Mr K D SHILLETO


Sir, Charles Batchelor's report ('Tunnel prompts Stena to simplify ferry
fares', January 5) on the 'simplification' of Stena Line cross-Channel fares
appears to indicate another huge rise in some tariffs, particularly for a
car with driver only or even with single passenger. For these travellers the
increase, particularly during the summer months, will represent a much
greater rise than the 'couple of per cent' vaguely indicated by the
operators.
This is typical of the arrogant and rapacious attitude of the ferry
companies towards travellers since announcement of the construction of the
Channel tunnel.
One is persuaded that they have deliberately raised their almost identical
fares way beyond inflation almost every year, confident that the eventual
Chunnel tariffs could not compete with them if necessary cash flow to
service mounting debt was to be raised.
They have now set a comfortable 'floor' for the tunnel while castly
increasing their own profit potential. There is a smell of collusion about
this cost-push manoeuvre which involves not only the ferry operators but the
tunnel management as well.
Dr Stefan Szymanski of Imperial College has written a paper, already
referred to in your newspaper, that clearly indicates progressive and
unwarrantable raising of ferry tariffs since the announcement of the
tunnel's construction. It is to be hoped that the Office of Fair Trading and
the EU competition office are closely monitoring this pocket-picking of the
public.
Cross-Channel ferry tariffs have been set far above any comparative journey
in Europe for as long as I can remember. Why should the advent of an
additional alternative send up passenger costs even further? That is not
competition or the working of a 'market'.

Although the Channel Tunnel opened for a very exclusive clientele this week,
it will be a while before British drivers start pouring through the Chunnel
en masse. But thousands of drivers will pile on to ferries and hovercraft
this summer.
In a continental Europe supposedly without borders, you might think driving
there should not require any more special planning than a long-distance trip
within the UK. Unfortunately, car insurance and breakdown cover which are
perfectly adequate in the UK can leave you exposed to all sorts of trouble a
few miles across the Channel.
Green proof-of-insurance cards were not consigned to the dustbin at the end
of 1992; French police have been known to fine foreign motorists caught
without one far more recently. And police in Spain can jail you after an
accident, so it is wise to travel with a bail bond.
Breaking down on the M25 is enough of a nightmare - but being stranded on
the hard shoulder of the Paris ring road could be 10 times worse. The
biggest selling point for the AA, RAC, Europ Assistance, National Breakdown
and the other rescue services is the promise of a friendly, English-speaking
voice on the other end of the emergency telephone who can summon help
anywhere in Europe.
Some of the services have their own rescue patrols, while others use a
network of local companies. All promise a speedy roadside response and will
tow your car to a service station - or, if necessary, return it to the UK.
Extras to look for are: emergency credit facilities; additional
accommodation costs; car hire or other onward travel costs; despatch of
spare parts from the UK; and provision of a driver if the only one in your
group is incapacitated.
The AA charges Pounds 30.50 for one week's car-only Five Star cover for
Europe while the RAC's equivalent Eurocover costs Pounds 40.95 for between
five and nine days (Pounds 3 off for existing RAC members). National
Breakdown's Blue Riband scheme would cost Pounds 31.25 for the same period
and Europ Assistance would charge Pounds 25.50 for seven days. If you just
want to go to Ireland, it could cost less. There are often supplements for
cars more than 10 years old, and caravans or trailers.
Carrying a green card is no longer a strict legal requirement (although this
message might not have filtered through to the more rural police forces),
but it is still sensible to take one in case you have an accident or are
stopped by police. You should always tell your insurance company before
taking the car abroad; otherwise, you could find your cover restricted to
the third party legal minimum.
If you have comprehensive cover in the UK, you will probably want to extend
this for overseas trips. Some insurers include European cover free while
others charge up to Pounds 50, according to brokers Telesure. A few, such as
General Accident, issue a European certificate automatically with policy
documents. Very frequent travellers or those spending extended periods
abroad - such as second-home owners - may have to make special arrangements
with their insurance company.
Most of the breakdown cover packages allow you free rein to wander as far
afield as Moscow or Morocco, but a few corners of Europe are out of bounds:
the former Yugoslavia and Albania are among likely exclusions. If you are
planning an adventurous itinerary, check before you go.
Insurers can be more restrictive, and some start charging more than their
standard European rates if you venture into, say, Turkey or Romania. As
usual, it is best to make inquiries before setting off if there is a chance
you could stray outside the European Union.
Some pieces of equipment, such as a warning triangle and in-car first aid
kit, are compulsory in many places and recommended in any case. There are
also a few quirks you should know about. It is illegal to carry spare fuel
in Italy, Luxembourg, Greece and Turkey, and you must carry spare headlamp
bulbs in Spain.
Motoring organisations such as the AA and RAC have leaflets on motoring
regulations, speed limits and equipment required by law in the countries
visited most often by UK tourists. On-the-spot fines for breaking the rules
could make a large dent in your holiday spending money - and traffic police
do not always accept credit cards.
Sales of unleaded petrol in the UK have overtaken the leaded variety but the
same is not true in all parts of Europe: unleaded can be hard to come by off
the beaten track in Spain, Italy and eastern Europe.
Leaded fuel can cause expensive damage to catalytic converters so it is a
wise move to fill up with unleaded before crossing borders and, indeed,
wherever it is available.
Travel insurance is also a must, particularly to cover medical and legal
expenses.

   MOST of the world's great cities are either modern


New York and Tokyo - or monumental, like Rome and Prague. Paris is almost
alone in being both. It is a picture postcard of a city - breathtakingly
beautiful and steeped in history, but with all the techno-toys of a modern
metropolis.
The Mitterrand era is now nearing its end. But Francois Mitterrand and his
glittering Grands Projets will leave as strong a stamp on the fabric of
Paris as Henry IV's 16th century construction schemes and Baron Haussmann's
19th century urbanisation drives.
The Grands Projets are President Mitterrand's monuments to modernism, but he
has also breathed new life into the city's past. In the Mitterrand years,
ancient buildings have been renovated, the statues of the city regilded and
the grime washed away from the sandstone bridges along the Seine. The result
is a compelling combination of the old and the new.
The real appeal of the Grands Projets is their rapport with the ancient
aspects of Paris. The giant glass pyramid in the Louvre is all the more
beguiling because of the contrast between its glacial modernity and the
grandeur of the old courtyards. The brutal new Grande Arche at La Defense
looks at its best when framed by the 19th century splendour of the original
Arc de Triomphe.
Then there is Palais-Royal, the arched arcades built by Cardinal Richelieu
as an aristocratic enclave in the 17th century that degenerated into dens of
debauchery under Philippe d'Orelans in the next century. The Grand Vefour,
the restaurant where Napoleon dined with Josephine, is still there today as
is the tiny cobbler tucked away on rue de Beaujolais, a beneficiary of
Paris' paternalistic property law. But Palais-Royal is also the home of Jack
Lang's arts ministry. The ministry itself has been meticulously restored,
but a futuristic wall of video screens shimmers through the windows and
Daniel Buren's monochrome sculptures glower in the courtyard.
Paris does share the shortcomings of most metropolises. The streets are
choked with traffic. The pavements are littered with the homeless, the
jobless, the penniless and the new efflux of emigres from eastern Europe.
The city centre may be plush and prosperous but its suburbs are
socially-explosive powderkegs of poverty and violence. This is a side of
Paris that the traveller can choose not to see. The French excel at le luxe
and Paris can pamper its visitors like no other city. A grand hotel like the
Crillon, or the great restaurants, Taillevent and Lucas-Carton, offer
classic French style at its very best. This is the peculiarly Parisian
product of finesse and instinct, beautiful, but restrained without the
slightest hint of vulgarity.
But the paupers' Paris has its pleasures too. It costs next to nothing to
travel from one end of the city to another on the fast and efficient Metro
system, or to sip a steaming cafe-creme at the counter of an Art Nouveau
cafe-tabac.
As for staring at the silhouette of the Seine islands while crossing the
Pont des Arts, or catching the magical moment when the lights of Place de la
Concorde come on all at the same time, that costs nothing at all.

NO HELP AT EMBASSY 




Referring to the story on embassy help by Richard Gilbert in the June 17 Travel 
Section ("Abroad and In Trouble? An Embassy Can Help"), I dare say he didn't 
ever work at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. 


Two years ago, and two days before leaving Paris for home, my purse with all 
our travel documents was ripped off. 


We went immediately to the embassy and were met by two men with deep accents 
who advised us to report to the local gendarmerie. We did, with much 
language-barrier difficulty. Then the two men said the embassy only deals with 
French-American problems and we would have to go to the consulate (which was 
closed for the weekend). We had to wait until Monday for any aid. 


Fortunately we were with friends who helped tide us over. At the consulate, we 
had to buy new passports with cash only (no traveler's checks, no credit cards) 
and new pictures, and we also had to wait a full day, almost missing our flight 
home. The consulate people weren't very pleasant about it either. They behaved 
as though we had committed a sin. 


While we sat waiting all day at the consulate, we watched how some of our 
citizens were treated by the French employees of our consulate. Students that 
had been robbed of everything were not even allowed to make collect calls home 
for a full 24 hours to get funds. They were advised to apply to some charitable 
agency for help in the interim. 


What possible excuse is there for treating our own citizens in such a cavalier 
fashion? Is this the government we support with our taxes? Thanks for letting 
me unload a lot of long dormant anger.

Hardened businessmen and journalists burst into spontaneous applause on
Friday evening as the driver announced that we were travelling at 100mph 40
metres below the seabed of the Channel on the first public journey through
the channel tunnel, writes Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent, who
was with the group.
The new Eurostar trains, which will not be operating commercially until next
summer, will transport passengers in just three hours from the centre of
London to the centre of Paris. The trains are still being tested. Friday's
historic trip through the tunnel was made in a Thameslink Sprinter.
It may have been historic but it was not spectacular. After 30 minutes one
tunnel looks much like another.
But the ride was exceptionally smooth. With the air-conditioning working, a
guaranteed seat and a meal, it will be very comfortable.
Return fares to Paris and Brussels will match those charged by airlines. The
first consumer test suggests the tunnel will be a real alternative for the
business traveller crossing the channel - that is if British Rail can sort
out the journey from London to the tunnel.

   LILLE


Mr Pierre Mauroy yesterday inaugurated a FFr800m (Pounds 96m) shopping
centre, the latest stage in the colossal 'Euralille' commercial/transport
project in the centre of the north French city.
The venture forms a key part of his campaign to win a fifth six-year term as
mayor of Lille next year.
The former Socialist prime minister has been mentioned as a possible
Socialist presidential candidate if Mr Jacques Delors decides not to run.
But despite recent conservative inroads into his Socialist bastion, Mr
Mauroy's enthusiasm for municipal politics seems undimmed. To bolster his
record as mayor since 1971, he is counting heavily on the Euralille project
and on Mr Delors' own daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, the former labour
minister, who is running on his ticket as first deputy mayor in the June
1995 municipal elections.
But the politically double-edged nature of the Euralille project was
underlined yesterday when organisers of the new 66,500 square metre
commercial centre admitted that they had deliberately turned away textile
and clothing companies wanting to install themselves in the new centre in
order to protect these traditional industries of Lille, where unemployment
is already more than 13 per cent. 'In the interests of diversification, we
decided to make leisure and beauty a major theme of the centre which is now
95 per cent filled,' one organiser said coyly.
Exploiting the local textile industry's anxiety, Mr Alex Turk, a Gaullist
RPR law professor running for mayor against Mr Mauroy has criticised the
Euralille project for siphoning too much money away from other social
services and for over-emphasising commercial development, rather than just
settling for the still-ambitious goal of making Lille the hub of new TGV
high-speed train services between Paris, London and eventually Brussels.
Mr Jean-Paul Baietto, overall director of Euralille, said yesterday that the
city had only sunk FFr84m directly into the project, with its main
contribution being the gift of 70 hectares city centre site which had been
in French army hands from the 17th century until the early 1980s. More than
FFr3bn of the total investment was from the private sector, and much of the
balance from central and regional government and French railways.
But the delayed start to full commercial TGV services through the Channel
Tunnel was in danger of unbalancing the project, he conceded.
Some delay has been welcome, he said, because Lille started its TGV station
well after work on the Chunnel began. But the Lille station was finished
last May, 'and we will be in trouble if the Eurostar (TGV) trains don't
start arriving by next May', he said.
The next chunks of Euralille, described as Europe's biggest city renewal
project, due to open are a 5,000 seat theatre in November and a World Trade
Centre next January. The latter is supposed to provide a variety of services
to travelling businessmen.
The trade centre will include apartments, temporary offices, and banks and
travel agencies, and as such it is highly dependent on the Eurostars
bringing in the businessmen.
