  [Text] India and Germany have agreed to take all necessary 
steps to boost India-German cooperation in industrial and 
technical fields. The two countries have agreed to set up an 
India-Germany joint mechanism to monitor progress in scientific 
cooperation. An official spokesman summing up the prime 
minister's visit to Bonn said both the countries have also 
agreed to review the avoidance of double taxation treaty and 
pursue efforts to sign bilateral investment guarantees. Our 
correspondent Sudarshnam reports from Bonn: 
  [Begin Sudarshnam recording] The Federation of German 
Industry and India-German Chamber of Commerce have sent 54 
proposals to intensify the economic relationship between the two 
countries. These relate to general and financial issues, 
pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, private sector and air 
traffic. As many as 40 ministries and departments in India 
examined these proposals. Several of these have been 
implemented. Decision in respect of some are awaited. [end 
recording] 
  In another development, leading political parties of Germany 
have assured India that the New Asia concept initiated by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl making India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation will be honored whichever 
party comes to power in this year's German elections. The 
assurance was conveyed to the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, when important German political leaders called on him in 
Bonn yesterday. An official spokesman said that there is a 
multiparty support to Chancellor Kohl's New Asia concept, as 
Germany has willingly recognized that Japan, China and India in 
Asia will be important political and economic powers in the 
years to come. The chief of the German Agency for Aid has 
shown his willingness to open a second window for soft credit to 
finance infrastructure projects in India. The projects include 
power and telecommunications sector. Meanwhile, the minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who is 
accompanying the prime minister, has reiterated India's 
willingness to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. He 
made it clear that Islamabad has no locus standi in Kashmir, and 
it is not in a position to advise India in this matter. The 
minister said India has no problems regarding protection of 
human rights, and it is always ready to be open with 
international human rights organizations. 
  As reported, the prime minister is leaving for Berlin today. 
He will meet the German president and address the Humboldt 
University. Mr. Narasimha Rao is also scheduled to have meeting 
with German business leaders and inaugurate the Indian Cultural 
Center in Berlin. On Sunday [6 February], Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
returning home. Our correspondent Karuppaswamy reports that his 
meeting with German indologists and business leaders will be 
continuation of his earlier exprience in Bonn to reassure 
Germans that the reform process in India is irreversible. The 
visit of the prime minister is the first official visit from 
India to the reunited Berlin -- the upcoming capital of the 
united Germany.

  [Excerpts] Germany has assured India that it will continue 
to take a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and not make any 
value judgments. Kashmir figured prominently in the talks 
between the prime minister and the German leaders in Bonn. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao explained to them the problems faced by India 
because of Pakistan's abetment of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir 
and Punjab. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Spranger, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. He emphasized that the theme of the Asian 
partnership choice and strategic partnership should be made a 
reality [sentence as heard]. 
  Our correspondent S. Sudarshanam adds from Bonn that India's 
line of thinking is in tune with Germany's new Asia policy which 
seeks to widen its cooperation with the Asian countries like 
Japan, China, and India. The German minister told the prime 
minister that he would lead a 20-member delegation to India soon 
to explore further cooperation in trade, investment, and joint 
venture in technical and technological fields. The signing of 
aid protocol for this year will also come up during his visit. 
  Meanwhile, the new foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, 
told 
newspersons at Bonn that the German leaders emphasized greater 
cooperation in trade, science, and technology. He said Germany 
is a major trading partner with India and two German ministers 
in charge of economic development and foreign affairs are 
planning to visit India before June this year. 
  The chairman of the German multinational corporation, Bayer, 
held talks with the prime minister and indicated that Bayer is 
to set up a pharmaceutical plant at Manali in Tamil Nadu. This 
afternoon, the prime minister will have talks with the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, on strengthening economic and trade 
relations. Dr. Kohl will host a working lunch. Cooperation in 
scientific, technical, and cultural fields and issues of mutual 
interests are likely to figure in the talks. The prime 
minister, now on a four-day official visit, will leave for 
Berlin tomorrow.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came home
Friday after five days in China and said his visit restored the
friendly Indian-Chinese relations of the early 1950s.
   Also Friday, about 100 Tibetan students outside Parliament set
fire to a Chinese flag and denounced India's recognition of Tibet as
part of China. Police with bamboo canes watched the rally but did
generally not interfere.
   Gandhi told a news conference at New Delhi's international
airport, ``I believe this visit will be a new beginning for both
countries.''
   A border dispute has strained relations between China and India,
the world's two most populous countries, for nearly three decades.
China has more than 1 billion people, and India has about 800
million.
   Gandhi's visit to Beijing was the first by an Indian prime
minister since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited China in
1954.
   The two countries issued a communique in Beijing earlier Friday,
agreeing to set up a joint working group to take up the territorial
dispute, which led to war in 1962. Gandhi said the group would set a
time frame in which to resolve the issue.
   The communique also said Chinese Premier Li Peng has accepted an
invitation to visit New Delhi, but no date was set.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier that
India says is part of its Arunachal Pradesh state. India also says
China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles in India's Kashmir
state.
   Gandhi also told reporters that Chinese leaders respected India's
views on Tibet, another sore point in relations. China invaded
mountainous Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later.
   The communique noted that China ``expressed concern over
anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that
the Indian side had repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a
part of China and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese
political activities on Indian soil.
   India has granted asylum to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's religious
leader, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Beijing blames
supporters of the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that
led to clashes with police in the last 14 months.
   India and China on Thursday signed three agreements _ a civil
aviation accord calling for direct flights between New Delhi and
Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement, and a science and
technology pact.

  [Text] India and Germany have expressed concern at the 
dangers posed by religious extremism. The prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for immediate 
steps to check the spread of this threat. Briefing newsmen on 
the one-to-one talks between Mr. Rao and Dr. Kohl, an official 
spokesman said in Bonn that the two leaders discussed 
Indo-Pakistan relations. The prime minister reiterated that 
India is in favor of peaceful relations with Pakistan. Mr. Rao, 
however, regretted that despite New Delhi's efforts, the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has taken a 
strident view. Referring to the package of proposals offered by 
India following the recent foreign secretary-level talks, Mr. 
Rao expressed the hope that continuance of worthwhile dialogue 
will yield positive results. During the talks, Bonn promised to 
take steps to speed up access of German technology to India. 
The German chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, said bottlenecks, if 
any, will be removed. He promised to support India in its 
dealings with the European Union. Germany has a prominent place 
in the Union. Our correspondent, S. Sudarshanam, understands 
that Mr. Rao spoke about human rights environment in India and 
the steps taken to protect and promote the human rights 
aspirations of the people. Earlier, the German foreign affairs 
minister, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, called on the prime minister. 
  The prime minister is visiting Berlin later today. Our 
special correspondent, Karuppaswamy, reports: 
  [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] Berlin is one of the very big 
cities in the world outside India with a full-fledged museum 
dedicated exclusively to Indian art. There are several streets 
named after Ravindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indira 
Gandhi. And Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose visited the city for 
the possible assistance during freedom struggle. Mr. Narasimha 
Rao will be received by the federal president, Dr. Richard Von 
Weizsacker. His engagements during his two days of visit to 
Berlin include a meeting with the governing mayor of the city, 
the German indologists, and representatives of the industry and 
commerce. [end recording]

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India ended a visit
to China today with the two nations expressing a common desire to
improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations.
   Gandhi, accompanied by his wife, Sonia, departed for home from
Shanghai after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head of
government since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited in 1954.
   Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will
between the world's most populous nations. Gandhi said his trip
marked a ``new beginning'' for the two countries.
   During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint working
group to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial dispute
that broke out into a short border war in 1962.
   ``The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depth
discussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed to
settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,''
a joint communique said.
   It added, ``They also agreed to develop their relations actively
in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and
conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary
question.''
   It said Gandhi's talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng were held
``in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutual
understanding.'' Gandhi also met with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang and President Yang Shangkun.
   The border issue, Gandhi said, is ``very complicated'' and a
quick solution is unlikely.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   The communique said China ``expressed concern over anti-China
activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that the Indian
side repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a part of China and
banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities
on Indian soil.
   India has been the home of Tibet's religious leader, the Dalai
Lama, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. China blames supporters of
the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that have led to
violent clashes with police the past 14 months.
   Gandhi on Thursday presided over the signing of three bilateral
agreements _a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights
between New Delhi and Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement and a
science and technology agreement.
   The communique said Premier Li accepted an invitation to visit
India, but no date was set.
   China, grappling with economic problems at home, has made a
commitment to improving relations with its neighbors.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to visit China
next year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years.
   China will likely normalize relations with the Soviet Union
during the visit. The two countries fought a border war in 1969.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and China's
president, Yang Shangkun, today discussed China's troubled region of
Tibet, and Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's
internal affairs.
   The Indian leader spent much of his second day in China
sightseeing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Yang explained China's
position on Tibet to Gandhi during a one-hour meeting at the Great
Hall of the People.
   Yang, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president
since April, stressed that the Beijing government provides
assistance to the Tibetan region, one of China's most backward areas.
   ``We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the
Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,''
Yang said.
   Gandhi repeated India's position that Tibet is an autonomous
region of China and that India will not interfere in China's
internal affairs, Xinhua said.
   The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the
two countries because India has provided refuge to the Tibetan
religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his followers, who have
demanded independence for Tibet. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after he led a failed uprising against Chinese military forces.
   At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by Chinese security
forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on
Dec. 10. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in Lhasa
in the past 14 months.
   China and India are trying to restore friendly ties after a
quarter century of soured relations, which hit bottom during a
21-day border war in 1962.
   The border question was the main topic during talks Monday
between Gandhi and China's Premier Li Peng.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of what India says is part of
its northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claims 14,500 square
miles of land seized by China in 1962.
   Gandhi and Li, however, vowed not to let the border problem
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to visit China since his
grandfather, former Prime Minister Jawalharlal Nehru, came in 1954.
   Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, Sonia, Gandhi today
traveled about 37 miles northwest of Beijing to the Badaling section
of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a
2,000-year period to keep out invaders.
   The Indian leader also visited the Temple of Heaven, a 15th
century structure where China's emperors once prayed for good
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang.
   The two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation,
border trade, science and technology and the exchange of consular
offices in Shanghai and Bombay.

  [Text] The prime minister has invited German businessmen 
to invest in India. Addressing the Indo-German Economic 
Conference in Bonn today, Mr. Narasimha Rao described the 
industrial climate in the country as extremely good and 
favorable for investment. Making it clear that his government 
has absolutely no hesitation in going ahead with the economic 
liberalization process, Mr. Rao asserted that India will step up 
the reform process. He assured the German industry that there 
will be no constraints coming in the way. He added that 
constraints if any will be resolved by him and the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. 
  Opening the conference, the chancellor, Dr. Kohl, assured 
India of all possible assistance for the development of the 
industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic 
policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference 
that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of 
Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr. 
Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish 
a high-level India-German commission for science and technology. 
The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N. 
Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on 
technology transfer. 
  Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that 
German 
industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and 
liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been 
forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after 
a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being 
examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our 
correspondent understands that a German festival in India will 
be held as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the 
forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao 
inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force. 
  Here is a report from our special correspondent A. 
Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the 
first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German 
chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step 
towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the 
successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists 
since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of 
view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference 
largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to 
come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global 
interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable 
strategic partner in economic and scientific development because 
of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at 
liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end 
recording] 
  That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn. 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. 
  Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a 
neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured 
prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the 
German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the 
problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is 
deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful 
dialogue.

India of all possible assistance for the development of the 
industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic 
policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference 
that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of 
Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr. 
Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish 
a high-level India-German commission for science and technology. 
The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N. 
Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on 
technology transfer. 
  Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that 
German 
industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and 
liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been 
forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after 
a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being 
examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our 
correspondent understands that a German festival in India will 
be held as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the 
forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao 
inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force. 
  Here is a report from our special correspondent A. 
Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the 
first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German 
chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step 
towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the 
successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists 
since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of 
view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference 
largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to 
come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global 
interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable 
strategic partner in economic and scientific development because 
of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at 
liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end 
recording] 
  That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn. 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. 
  Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a 
neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured 
prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the 
German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the 
problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is 
deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful 
dialogue.

  [Text] Bonn, February 4--The Indian government is 
"seriously considering" doing away with the situation that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category, 
as part of ongoing liberalisation process, UNI reports. 
  This has been conveyed by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, in the Indian government's reply to the "Kohl 
memorandum" sent to New Delhi after the German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl's visit to India in February last year. 
  The memorandum, entitled `Proposals on Economic Policies and 
Procedures of the Government of India', was forwarded by the 
Chancellor in July last year. 
  Some of the other proposals for further liberalisation, made 
in the memorandum and under active consideration of the 
government, are: 
  --Liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry; 
  --Removal of the phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy; 
  --Increasing the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations; 
  --Amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act. 
  The government's reply to the memorandum also states that on 
some other issues, such as enforceability of foreign awards, the 
government had an "open mind" and was willing to consider the 
matter. 
  The Indian reply to the memorandum was given to the German 
government a few days before Mr Rao's arrival on a state visit 
here. 
  The Indian reply states that it must be appreciated as a 
fundamental point relating to the issues raised in the "Kohl 
memorandum" that since the process of reforms was initiated 
several policy changes had been progressively made and 
procedures increasingly streamlined to improve the business 
environment in the country. 
  The reply adds that several of the proposals made in the 
memorandum were already under implementation. They were 
identified as: 
  --To decrease the number of industries reserved for the 
public sector; 
  --Faster clearance for applications under the EPCG [Export 
Promotion Capital Goods] scheme; 
  --Negotiation of more favourable double-taxation agreement; 
  --More liberal procedures for payment of foreign 
technicians; 
  --Long duration purchase agreements for power and secured 
fuel supplies for such projects; 
  --Equal opportunities for manufacturers in the telecom 
sector. 
  Under six broad classifications, the memorandum put forward 
suggestions on a vast range of areas and subjects such as 
desirability of a "negative" list; speeding up of state 
governments' proposals; uniform industrial policy in the states; 
remittance facilities for foreign nationals; disinvestment 
procedures; and governing law and arbitration for contracts 
entered into with foreign parties. 
  PTI adds: Leading political parties in Germany 
have assured India that the new `Asia concept' unveiled by the 
Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, with India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation and embracing a wide range of 
fields, would be honoured irrespective of which party came to 
power in this year's elections there. 
  This assurance was conveyed to Mr Rao, when a series of 
important German political leaders called on him here yesterday. 
  An official spokesman said that by and large there was "a 
multi-party support" to Dr Kohl's new `Asia concept', as Germany 
has willingly recognised that Japan, China and India in Asia 
would be the important political and economic powers in the 
coming years. 
  The important German leaders who called on Mr Rao included 
Mr 
Hans Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of 
Socialist Democratic Party, Dr Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Party, and 
Dr Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of Free Democratic Party. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Rao reached the historic city of Berlin this 
afternoon on the last leg of his six-day tour to Davos and 
Germany. 
  Mr Rao is scheduled to meet the German President, Mr Richard 
von Weizsaecker, besides opening the cultural festival programme 
at the Indian cultural centre there tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Rajiv Gandhi comes to China Monday for the first
visit by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, Jawalharlal
Nehru, made the trip 34 years ago.
   For Gandhi's nation and his political future, the stakes appear
high. For China, little seemingly can go wrong.
   During a week long on symbolism but short on substance, Gandhi
will be feted in the capital, tour the ancient city of Xian and
visit Shanghai.
   The visit, Gandhi recently said, will be ``very important ... for
this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations _ the world's most populous _ will probably sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology, Indian and Western diplomats said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. China and India also may agree to establish consular
offices.
   But no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of
their 2,400-mile border, over which the two countries fought a brief
war in 1962.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress. China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian territory.
India rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200
square miles it took in the 1962 war.
   Since then, relations have improved, but only slightly. The
border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade,
which resumed in 1977 but amounted to only $150 million last year,
is limited.
   Both China and India say Gandhi's visit is intended to create an
atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border
question. But Western diplomats said pressures on Gandhi could make
him more willing to compromise than his Chinese counterparts.
   China is moving quickly to improve relations with the Soviet
Union after nearly three decades of hostility. A summit between
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping may be held next year.
   Better Chinese-Soviet relations will eliminate Moscow's need to
cultivate New Dehli as a foil against Beijing. And by removing
tensions along its northern border, China will be under less
pressure to accomodate India on its southern flank.
   China continues its close relationship with Pakistan, India's
traditional enemy. Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, is
expected to visit China in January on her first official trip abroad.
   ``For Gandhi, the whole visit has an air of him running along so
he doesn't get left out in the cold,'' said a Western diplomat in
Beijing who recently returned from New Delhi. ``For the Chinese, the
visit can't possibly go wrong.''
   A society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign
affairs, China has watched with apparent enjoyment as the Indian
press has pressured Gandhi to make progress on the border issue,
Western diplomats said.
   ``The prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to
his travel bags,'' wrote the normally pro-government Times of India
in an editorial Wednesday. ``The more important question, however,
is, what is the prime minister going to China for?''
   Gandhi also faces an election next year in which victory is far
from certain. Diplomats say he must convince his public that simply
establishing goodwill with the Chinese _ and not achieving a
dramatic breakthrough _ is a worthy goal.
   ``If he feels that he is failing at that, he might be persuaded
to do something rash,'' the Western diplomat said.
   India could use the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader who has
taken refuge in India since 1959, to embarrass the Chinese. The
Tibetan refugees' parliament-in-exile on Friday called on Gandhi to
raise the issue of Tibet with Chinese leaders.
   But India's hand is weakened by China's apparent willingness to
crush dissent in Tibet, regardless of international opinion. On Dec.
10, police shot and killed at least one monk in Lhasa, the capital
of Tibet, during an anti-Chinese demonstration. In addition, New
Delhi also has backed China's claims to the region.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
China in the early 1950s. Relations soured in the early 1960s over
the border question and political disagreements.
   Relations improved slightly in the late 1970s. China invited an
Indian leader to visit as early as 1979, but India agreed to come
only in November of last year.
   Western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was
significant because it came well after Sino-Soviet relations had
begun to improve.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their
troubled border, the main issue dividing the world's most populous
nations, Indian journalists said.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet and trade with his Chinese hosts.
   Gandhi and China's premier, Li Peng, met for two hours in the
morning following Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi. They continued
meetings after lunch, said the journalists who attended a news
briefing closed to non-Indian reporters.
   Gandhi's five-day visit marks the first time an Indian leader has
come to China since 1954, when his grandfather Jawalharlal Nehru
came to Beijing.
   The last time Chinese and Indian leaders met was in 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. Two years later, India and
China fought a war over the border and China occupied a large chunk
of Indian territory.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing accompanied by about 100 top officials
and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology.
   Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   Little progress was expected on the 2,400-mile border.
   China's Xinhua News Agency and Indian journalists said Gandhi and
Li agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the
border question peacefully.
   ``We should work now toward resolution of the border issue while
we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral
relations,'' the journalists quoted Gandhi as saying.
   Li said the border problem was hindering the two countries'
relations, Xinhua reported.
   Xinhua also said Li expressed ``admiration'' for India's position
on Tibet, a Chinese province bordering India.
   India has reiterated that Tibet is part of China and forbids
Tibetan refugees in India from engaging in political activities. In
1959, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's leader, and thousands of Tibetan
refugees fled to India after an abortive, anti-Chinese uprising.
   On Dec. 10, at least one monk was killed in the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa during a clash between Chinese troops and Tibetans who seek
an end to 38 years of Chinese rule. It was the third bloody clash in
Lhasa in 14 months.
   Earlier Monday, at the Great Hall of the People in downtown
Beijing, Gandhi was given a 19-gun salute and met by Premier LI.
   Indian and Chinese flags lined Tiananmen Square, colored flags
lined the city's main boulevard, Changanjie.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and personal
and political disagreements between Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and
Prime Minister Nehru.
   China now claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India
rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200 square
miles it took in the war.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations instead of
exporting socialist revolution.
   Direct trade resumed in 1977 but it amounted to just $150 million
in 1986-87 with few prospects for growth.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress in eight rounds.
   Interviews with Chinese scholars over the weekend found them
pessimistic about the possibility for good Sino-Indian ties. For
one, they said, the economies of the two countries are too similar
to allow for much trade.
   ``They export textiles and we export textiles. They want high
technology and we want high technology,'' said Zhang Minqiu, deputy
director of the Institute of South and Southeast Asian Studies at
Beijing University. ``We're competitors so we lack cooperative
spirit.''
   In addition, Chinese researchers said the border question appears
intractable.
   ``In some of the areas that we claim, the Indian government has
made big investments and has registered good economic growth,'' said
Ms. Zhang. ``It's very hard to see them giving it up.''

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping agreed today to restore friendly ties between
the world's most populous countries despite a long-standing border
dispute.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old senior Chinese
leader said to Gandhi, 44, as the two leaders met in the Great Hall
of the People.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' Deng said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   ``I agree and would like to thank you for your warm welcome,''
Gandhi said.
   Deng said he knew Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, who
came to China in 1954, the last Indian prime minister to do so.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between, there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' Deng said. ``But let us forget it.
We should be looking forward.''
   Later at a speech at presitigious Qinghua University, Gandhi
summed up the goal of his five-day trip.
   ``I have every hope that during this visit we will, together with
our Chinese friends, build a better political climate for the
solution of the border issue,'' he said.
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   ``I am heartened that the Chinese leadership is more than
prepared to put behind us past rancor and past prejudices,'' Gandhi
said. ``I am heartened that we are both prepared not to be mired in
the past.''
   Chinese-Indian relations were good in the 1950s but a boundary
dispute led the two countries into war in 1962.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India rejects
the claim and demands China return the 15,200 square miles it took
in the 1962 war.
   During Gandhi's visit, China and India are expected to sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology. Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be
established.
   Little progress is expected on the border.
   Gandhi arrived in Beijing on Monday and spent most of the day
meeting with Premier Li Peng. His visit marked the first time Indian
and Chinese leaders have met since 1960, when then-Premier Chou
Enlai went to New Delhi.
   Gandhi and Li discussed the border problem and Gandhi called for
a renewal of friendship between the two nations.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at a
banquet Monday night. ``It is now time to look forward to the
future. It is now time to restore the relationship between our two
countries.''
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict
with his Chinese hosts in talks his official spokesman described as
``warm, cordial and very friendly.''
   On Tuesday, Gandhi met with China's president, Yang Shangkun, and
again talked about China's troubled region of Tibet.
   Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's internal
affairs. The issue is sensitive because Tibet's spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, fled to India in 1959 after an abortive,
anti-Chinese uprising.
   Gandhi was to meet tonight with Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, he is to fly to the
ancient city of Xian and Friday he will go to Shanghai.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements.
   Relations began to improve in the late 1979s but the border
remains heavily guarded. The two countries began border talks in
1981 but have made little progress in eight rounds, the last of
which was held in November 1987.
   China has more than 1 billion people. India, the world's largest
democracy, has a population of about 800 million.

  [Text] Bonn, February 3--The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut 
Kohl, today assured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
that his country would do everything in its power to boost 
industrial and technological co-operation with India and 
announced that a high-level Indo-German commission on science 
and technology would be set up soon, report PTI and UNI. 
  Addressing the Indo-German economic conference along with Mr 
Rao, the German Chancellor said India's economic development was 
on the "right course" and acknowledged that there was scope for 
further increasing German investments in India. 
  Mr Rao, declaring there was "absolutely no hesitation or 
dilution in the commitment to liberalisation," urged German 
industrialists to take "one more determined step" to increase 
the flow of investments, in view of the "ideal opportunity" 
provided by the reforms process in India. 
  The Prime Minister assured both Indian and German 
industrialists at the conference that he and Dr Kohl would solve 
"any problem, if it comes to our level." 
  The two leaders told the delegates that both India and 
Germany were aware of the vast and untapped potential for 
further deepening and strengthening bilateral economic relations. 
  The federal government and German industry were following 
India's policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and 
"modern India, with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at 
liberalisation, is one of our most important partners on the 
Asian continent," the German leader told Mr Rao. 
  Mr Rao said further liberalisation to cover some more items 
was on the anvil. The items to be liberalised were those which 
one could think of, he said and added that he could not say a 
syllable more because the Union budget was only three weeks away. 
  Mr Rao welcomed the Asia offensive of the German 
industrialists who are increasingly turning towards the 
Asia-Pacific region for investments. India, Japan and China have 
been identified as major thrust areas by the newly-launched 
Asia-Pacific Association (APA). 
  In his observations, the president of the Confederation of 
Indian Industry (CII), Mr Jamshed N. Godrej, announced the 
signing of a memorandum of understanding between CII and BDI 
(the German federation of industry). 
  Mr Godrej said India, Germany and Singapore could enter into 
trilateral partnership to exploit the complimentaries and 
individual advantages in areas of skilled manpower, technology 
and industrial sophistication. 
  Meanwhile, Germany has told India that it would continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and avoid making any 
value judgment in the matter. 
  The issue figured prominently during the talks Mr Rao had 
with German leaders, during which he voiced serious concern over 
the problems his country faced with regard to Pakistan's aid to 
terrorists in the Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir and 
Punjab. 
  The issue also figured during the foreign secretary-level 
talks where the Indian foreign secretary, Mr K. Srinivasan, 
briefed his German counterpart on the outcome of the recent 
foreign secretary level talks in Islamabad and the subsequent 
six proposals mooted by New Delhi." 
  Germany urged India to sign the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty (NPT), which New Delhi has refused to comply with, 
arguing that the existing global non-proliferation regimes were 
discriminatory against the developing countries. 
  The German Chancellor reiterated his strong commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation which he has been consistently and 
resolutely pursuing at all international fora. 
  The German leader told Mr Rao that strengthening the 
existing 
global non-proliferation regimes must take "absolute priority" 
and reiterated his government's resolve for an indefinite 
unconditional extension of the NPT in 1995. 
  The two countries have been engaged in a comprehensive 
dialogue on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and other 
political matters of mutual concept at the foreign office-level 
talks for quite some time. The two sides have already held three 
rounds and the fourth round is due to commence shortly. 
  Three high-level ministerial delegations from Germany will 
visit India in the first half of the current year. 
  An official spokesman today said these high-level visits, 
which will follow Mr Rao's current visit, were in line with 
Germany's "new-look" Asia concept unfolded by the Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl. 
  The spokesman said the German development co-operation 
minister would visit India next month, followed by the visit of 
the German economic co-operation minister in April. 
  The German vice-chancellor and foreign affairs minister, Mr 
Klaus Kinkel, is expected to come in May. 
  The new German perception was that it had put too many eggs 
in the European basket. It now wanted to expand its influence in 
Asia as well and had identified India, Japan and China for 
cementing ties, the spokesman said. 
  Mr Rao's visit, his second to Germany in less than three 
years, was extremely important because Germany had already 
declared India "a partner of choice in Asia." Germany had also 
described its relationship with India as a "strategic" one. 
  Germany, Europe's number one and the world's third largest 
economy, till recently used to be the second largest investor in 
India, after the United States, but had gone down to the tenth 
position after 1990. 
  However, trade volume between India and Germany had been 
growing steadily and touched nearly 5.5 billion Deutsche Mark 
(DM) in 1992. It was anticipated to cross the DM 6 billion mark 
in the current financial year. 
  Indian exports to Germany have been getting more and more 
sophisticated and diversified.

officials say they do not expect any breakthroughs on the main border dispute
between the two countries, which involves unresolved claims to thousands of
square miles of largely uninhabited territory in the Himalayas.;   In
interviews published before Li's arrival, both the Chinese premier and India's
prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, emphasized that their countries shared an
interest in asserting themselves internationally at a time when an ascendant
West is moving to shape the post-Cold War order.;   In an apparent gesture to
Beijing, Indian officials arrested about 20 Tibetan democracy advocates before
Li's arrival and imposed tight security in the capital. India has for decades
provided safe haven to Tibetan exiles, including Tibet's spiritual leader, the
Dalai Llama, but had never arrested activists. A number of Tibetan protesters
demonstrated in New Delhi on Wednesday but were unable to get near the
visiting premier.  </TEXT>

<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "India, A Priority Area for </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 4--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today began the last leg of his Germany visit. 
Flying into Berlin from Bonn in a German Government plane, the 
Prime Minister's major programme for the day was a meeting with 
the German President, Mr. Richard von Weizsacker. Mr Rao also 
had a luncheon meeting with eminent Indologists here, when a 
number of issues to facilitate studies on India were brought to 
the notice of the Prime Minister. 
  With Mr. Weizsacker, the discussions were general in nature, 
it being basically a courtesy call. The German President is well 
acquainted with India, having been there in 1991. Mr. Weizsacker 
was in India at the height of its political crisis when the 
minority Chandra Shekar Government was in power and its 
continuance in office was under doubt. This aspect was 
highlighted by the German authorities on many occasions as a 
measure of their commitment to maintain high political relations 
with India, irrespective of the Government in power. 
  In fact, the importance that Germany attaches to India has 
been confirmed to the Prime Minister not only by the present 
Government in Bonn, but by the host of Opposition leaders as 
well, who called on Mr. Rao during his two-day stay in Bonn. 
<H5>  `Asia policy' </H5>
  The leaders of the coalition parties in the present 
Government, as well as those from other political parties, have 
also told Mr. Rao that the new "Asia policy" of Germany had a 
national consensus and would be pursued by any Government that 
comes to power after the federal elections in October this year. 
The "Asia policy" of Germany focuses on the entire Asian region 
as the priority area for trade and economic concentration as 
well as for high political contacts. Almost all the countries of 
Asia have been included in the priority list, including India 
and Pakistan, but three countries have been identified for 
intensive co-operation--China, Japan and India. 
  Parallel meetings conducted by the members of the Prime 
Ministerial delegation had also indicated that the German 
Government has sent out the signal to its industrialists that 
India is now a priority area for investment and that 
concentration should begin. The process has been facilitated by 
the fact that just a few days before Mr. Rao's visit, the 
Government of India relied to a detailed memorandum that was 
submitted by the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, after his 
return from India in February last year. This memorandum listed 
out the various irritants that were obstructing German 
investment in India and the response of the Government of India 
had been sought to the points raised. 
  The proposals submitted by the Germans were broadly divided 
into six categories covering the financial sector, the 
pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the power sector, 
telecommunications, air traffic and general issues. The Indian 
response too has been fairly detailed with areas listed out 
where decisions have already been taken. The pending areas 
include liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry, removal of phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy, 
increase in the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations, amendments to the 
Industrial Disputes Act and removal of the condition that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category. 
  The Government has also indicated that it is not in a 
position to agree to the suggestion for a negative list of 
imports, an uniform industrial policy in all the States, 
abolition of octroi and automatic adoption of environmental 
standards prescribed in advanced countries. 
<H5>  Joint Ventures </H5>
  Individual interactions between the Prime Minister and chief 
executive officesr of multinational corporations too have 
confirmed that German industry was now positive about investment 
in India. For instance, the representative of Mercedes Benz said 
that a passenger car project was being finalised with the Tata 
group which would make the project one of the major investments 
by Benz in India. Similarly, the Siemens group will be setting 
up two power projects in India--one at Jayamkondan with a 
capacity of 1,500 MW [megawatts] and another at Gandhar of 600 
MW capacity. Another multinational, BASF is setting up a 
chemicals factory in Mangalore for the manufacture of dyestuff.

  [Text] The prime minister left New Delhi this afternoon on 
a six-day visit to Switzerland and Germany. He was seen off at 
the airport by cabinet colleagues and senior officials. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao has been invited by the World Economic Forum to 
address the closing plenary of the symposium at Davos tomorrow. 
The prime minister is expected to apprise the world business 
community of the liberalization process in India. The theme for 
this year's Davos meet is redefining the basic assumptions of 
the world economy. The meeting of the forum, which began on 
Tuesday, is being attended by more than 20 heads of government 
and state. In all 800 company chief executives and 150 
government representatives are attending the deliberations. 
  From Davos, Mr. Rao will go on to Bonn on Wednesday on the 
second leg of his visit. He will hold talks with the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. Both the leaders will address the 
Indo-German Business Conference. The prime minister will later 
go to Berlin where he will meet the German president.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Germany has responded favourably 
to the Indian request for greater access to German technology 
and to its middle-level industry for partnership. 
  The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, during his just-concluded visit to Germany of 
clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding 
Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his 
ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic 
cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process. 
  Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their 
efforts for further democratisation of the United Nations, to 
reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of 
the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent 
members with veto. Both India and Germany are keen for a place 
in the extended Security Council with veto power. 
  In the next few months three high-level delegations from 
Germany, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for 
Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign 
Minister are slated to visit India to provide fresh impetus to 
growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields. 
  According to official sources in the External Affairs 
Ministry, in the context of German view of playing an important 
role in world affairs, Bonn has formulated a priority programme, 
"Asia concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high 
growth" Asian countries like Japan, China and India. The market 
in Russia and Europe was not considered to be sufficient to meet 
the growing German capabilities in fields like science, 
technology, economic, investment abroad. 
  These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future 
large-scale German investments could be expected in various 
spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit 
and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the 
outcome of the visit so early. 
  However, Mr Rao himself said that he was satisfied with the 
outcome of his German visit. 
  These sources further pointed out that the reception the 
Prime Minister received in Germany was much warmer and greater 
than the one he received during his first visit in September 
1991. 
  These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's 
talks 
with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated 
by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the 
talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the 
German official sources also denied having given any such 
briefing at all.

  [Text] Germany has assured India that it will continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on Kashmir and avoid making any value 
judgments in the matter. Kashmir figured prominently during the 
talks the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, had with the German 
leaders in Bonn. The prime minister explained to them the 
problems faced by India due to Pakistan's abetment of terrorism 
in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Mr. Narasimha Rao also 
apprised the German leaders of the serious threat posed to the 
country's unity and integrity from cross-border terrorism. The 
prime minister said Pakistan is deliberately creating conditions 
for not having a meaningful dialogue. He also informed them 
about the confidence-building measures his government had taken 
in the past toward good neighborly relations with Pakistan. 
  The issue also figured prominently during the foreign 
secretary-level talks in Bonn. The Indian side told the Germans 
about the setting up of the commission to look into the 
allegations of human rights abuses and permission given to the 
Amnesty International to visit the country. Attention was also 
drawn to the threat by Pakistan to move an anti-India resolution 
at the Geneva session on human rights. New Delhi sought 
Germany's help to thwart the attempt. Bonn assured that the 
anti-Indian motion on Kashmir will not serve any useful purpose. 
Both countries also called for wider representation in the UN 
Security Council to ensure the political effectiveness of the 
collective will of international community. Both India and 
Germany are aspirants of a permanent seat in the council.

<TEXT>
   China and India have agreed to establish a group
to take up their thorny border dispute following discussions with
visiting Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the Foreign Ministry
announced today.
   Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, speaking at the end of Gandhi's
visit to the Chinese capital, also said good will fostered by the
trip could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the near
future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian this afternoon following three days of talks
with China's top leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared that the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute, which exploded into a short war in 1962 and
since has poisoned relations between the world's two most populous
nations, was the most pressing topic in Gandhi's talks with Premier
Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Spokesman Li, speaking at a news conference, said:
   ``Thanks to the visit, the Sino-Indian history of relations now
ushers in a new period. Leaders of the two countries conducted
sincere and in-depth discussions on the border question between
China and India, which are conducive to reaching a solution on the
boundary question in the near future.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister-level
and will be like a joint commission.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks in the past seven
years on the border, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little or no progress.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' Gandhi
said at a Wednesday news conference. ``We can't expect instant
solutions.''
   The symbolic restoration of friendly ties dominated the Gandhi
trip, although the two sides added some substance today by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for direct flights between New
Delhi and Beijing and two other accords.
   The two sides also signed a three-year cultural exchange
agreement and a science and technology accord promoting contacts
between their scientific communities.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on
Friday. The two sides are to issue a joint communique when he
departs.

   China announced Thursday that it and India will
establish a group to tackle a border dispute that flared into a
brief war in 1962 and has poisoned relations between the world's
most populous nations ever since.
   The agreement was announced at the end of Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's historic visit to the Chinese capital. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing also said good will fostered by the
Gandhi visit could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the
near future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian on Thursday following three days of talks
with Chinese leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph, and declared the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute exploded into a short war 26 years ago and has
since kept the nations apart. It was the most pressing topic in
Gandhi's talks with Premier Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Li Zhaoxing, speaking at a news conference, said, ``thanks to the
visit the Sino-Indian history of relations now ushers in a new
period. Leaders of the two countries conducted sincere and in-depth
discussions on the border question between China and India, which
are conducive to reaching a solution on the boundary question in the
near future.''
   He said the two sides ``agreed to establish a joint working
group, which is specially devoted to the boundary question.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister level.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks since 1981 on the
border issue, but there has been no formal structure to the

said Wednesday. ``We can't expect instant solutions.''
   Gandhi's trip to Beijing brings a new era of detente to
Sino-Indian relations that is likely to be followed next year by a
visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Gorbachev visit
will formally end 30 years of political strain and distrust between
the Soviet Union and China.
   The symbolic restoration of ties dominated the Gandhi trip,
although the two sides added some substance Thursday by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for flights between New Delhi and
Beijing and accords for cultural and technological exchanges.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [2 January] India's 
head of government, P.V. Narisimha Rao, arrived in Bonn for a 
four-day visit to Germany and for talks on expanding relations. 
Rao is returning a visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited 
India last February and thus introduced a new stage of Germany's 
policy toward Asia. 
  A few hours after his arrival Rao, who will meet with Kohl, 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany), as well as high-ranking representatives of German 
industry and the leaders of the coalition parties this Thursday, 
had an appointment with Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter 
Spranger (Christian Social Union). The minister will go to 
India on 10 February to take a look at the projects of 
German-Indian cooperation in situ. On Wednesday, the Fraunhofer 
Society for the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council 
of Scientific and Industrial Research" signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  Deepening political and economic cooperation between India, 
which has 900 million inhabitants, and Germany will be the focus 
of all of Rao's meetings in Bonn and Berlin. On Friday 
President Richard von Weizsaecker will receive Rao in Bellevue 
Palace in Berlin. [passage omitted]

Demanding an end to China's rule of Tibet, Tibetan refugees in New Delhi,

<LEADPARA>  Chinese Premier Li Peng offered on Friday in New Delhi, India, to open a
dialogue with the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet, on any subject
except Tibetan independence. Li, whose visit to India has been dogged by
protests from Tibetan refugees, reiterated Beijing's position that Tibet is a
province of China, and there is no room to discuss independence, news services
reported. Tibetan officials were not immediately available for comment. But
the Chinese condition on talks with the Dalai Lama has prevented such meetings
in the past. Before Li's arrival Wednesday for a six-day visit, a spokesman
for the Dalai Lama's government in exile said the Chinese were approached with
a proposal for a meeting between Li and the Dalai Lama. But they replied that
the Dalai Lama must first renounce the demand for Tibetan independence. The
56-year-old Buddhist monk left New Delhi for his home in Dharmsala, 250 miles
north, the day before Li arrived. It was the first time since the Dalai Lama
fled Tibet in 1959 that he was in the same country at the same time as China's
leader.  </LEADPARA>

   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi put aside the
affairs of state for some sightseeing Tuesday, a day after talks
with Chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have
divided the world's two most populous nations.
   No breakthroughs were reported on the border issue, which led to
war in 1962.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict in
the Monday talks which his official spokesman described as ``warm,
cordial and very friendly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng and Gandhi met most of Monday following
Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi for a five-day visit to Beijing,
Xian and Shanghai. Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, were later treated to
a state banquet at which Li acted as host.
   Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the last Indian
leader to travel to China, going to Beijing in 1954. Chinese and
Indian leaders last met in 1960, when then-Premier Chou En-lai went
to New Delhi.
   On Tuesday, Gandhi toured the Temple of Heaven, a 15th century
structure where China's emperors once prayed for good harvests and
performed sacrificial rituals.
   In the afternoon, he was to travel 40 miles northwest of Beijing,
the capital, to the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The
3,720-mile-long barrier was built over 2,000 years to keep out
invaders from the north.
   Gandhi's only scheduled meeting Tuesday was with 81-year-old
President Yang Shangkun, a former senior army leader who took over
the largely ceremonial state post last April.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is to meet 84-year-old senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   China and India are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices
in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   In comments throughout Monday, Gandhi and Li said Chinese-Indian
relations should follow a two-track policy of solving the border
dispute and improving other areas of their relationship.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at the
banquet. ``It is now time to look forward to the future. It is now
time to restore the relationship between our two countries.''
   The pronouncements appeared to signal a change in Indian policy,
bringing it more in line with that of the Chinese. India said in the
past it would improve Indian-Chinese ties only after progress was
made on the border.
   Western diplomats said last week that Gandhi's political worries
and India's external problems could have sparked the change.
   China is improving its relations with the Soviet Union and
maintains strong relations with Pakistan, India's traditional enemy
on its northeastern border.
   China's strong international position may have convinced New
Delhi to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to Beijing, the
diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At home, Gandhi faces an election year next year in which victory
is by no means assured.
   Li also praised India's position on the restive region of Tibet,
which India recognizes as part of China.
   The Indian spokesman also said Gandhi and Li discussed Cambodia,
but he refused to elaborate. India recognizes the current government
of Cambodia, which was installed by Vietnam after the Hanoi
government invaded the country in December 1978. China supports
Cambodian resistance groups.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements. The border remains heavily guarded despite eight
rounds of Indian-Chinese talks on the question since 1981, the last
of which took place in November 1987.
   India says China should return 15,200 square miles of territory
it took in the 1962 war.

OVER GANDHI POST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At issue between the two men are less their ideologies, which are centrist,
than their personalities and styles, which are strikingly different.;   
Pawar, who has said in the past that he abhors "the social and political
culture in Delhi," the capital, is a highly successful regional politician
with a reputation for toughness and an ability to raise millions of dollars
for the party in the state and nation among businessmen in Bombay.;    Rao, on
the other hand, is an ailing, soft-spoken leader who has no political base and
few enemies, an intellectual whose critics say he would be too pliant to the
various factions in the party, thereby leaving the nation adrift for six
months to a year until new elections are called. Among those favoring Rao are
the so-called coterie of aides to Rajiv Gandhi, a group that Pawar is known to
detest.;    By Tuesday evening, at least 40 members of Parliament who are
believed to be supporters of Pawar demanded, in a statement, that lawmakers be
"left free" to elect their leader and that the party "opt for the democratic
process of election.";    Implicit in the somewhat unusual statement was
concern by Pawar's supporters that the Congress Party bosses as well as the
former aides to Gandhi were seeking to steamroll the appointment of Rao, a
former foreign minister who served under Gandhi as well as his mother, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    The debate comes as the party, which has ruled
India for 40 out of 44 years, prepared to return to power after emerging as
the front-runner in the nation's 10th parliamentary election. Projected to win
about 210 to 215 seats in Parliament, out of 511, Congress is now in the midst
of talks with left-of-center parties to forge a coalition that would enable it
to form a government.;    With Parliament set to resume on Thursday, the
Congress Party leadership is working under a deadline in which it will either
choose the leader and present the choice as a fait accompli to lawmakers, or
leave it up to the rank-and-file members of the party, who are seeking a
stronger voice in the control of India's dominant party after Rajiv Gandhi's
death.  </TEXT>

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 6--On the completion of the 
week-long foreign visit to Switzerland and Germany, the Prime 
Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned home today, highly 
satisfied with the interactions with political and business 
leaders. 
  Declining to address the customary on-board conference on 
his 
special aircraft, Mr. Rao just told presspersons in his 
delegation that "you have seen how the visit went off. I don't 
think I have anything more to add." 
  The task of elaborating on the Prime Minister's successful 
trip was left to the top officials who accompanied him, 
including his Principal Secretary, Mr. A.N. Verma, the Finance 
Secretary, Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the Foreign Secretary, 
Mr. K. Srinivasan. These officials drew attention to some of the 
significant aspects of the Prime Ministerial visit both in terms 
of economic and political content. 
  On the economic front, there were two factors which emerged 
from the visit. In Davos for instance, Mr. Rao chose the 
gathering of world business leaders to clarify India's position 
that it would go along on the path of economic reforms, but 
would choose its own pace and direction. 
<H5>  Pressure Resisted </H5>
  The insistent pressure on India to speed up the reforms 
process has been resisted by the assertion that the country 
would not blindly follow the prescriptions laid down by "people 
sitting thousands of miles away, but would instead choose its 
own model of development, suited to its genius and 
circumstances." In other words, potential foreign investors have 
been assured of the Government's commitment to the reforms 
process but with the caution that all their demands would not be 
met. 
  "There is a standard check-list with these people before 
they 
take investment decisions. Has the country de-regulated; has it 
lowered tariff barriers; has it privatised (meaning the public 
sector); has it liberalised labour laws, etc. We have said "Yes" 
to some of these points and "No" to the others. That is our 
position and it has been made clear to the investors what to 
expect from India," a senior official said. 
  That the Indian official position this year could be 
different from what it was in 1992--the Prime Minister's first 
visit to Davos--is obviously based on the stronger economic 
position today. With foreign exchange reserves of over $10 
billions, with a large number of proposals for foreign direct 
investment being cleared and with buoyant foreign institutional 
investment in the stock markets, India could afford to take a 
stronger stand at Davos this time, the official added. This 
strong economic position is reinforced by the fact that India is 
now definitely on the "investment radar screen" of most 
industrial groups, particularly with the collapse of the 
expectations that had arisen with the changes in eastern Europe 
two years ago. 
  "The euphoria about Russia is over. The other markets don't 
show much prospects. The Asian region and India are the few 
bright spots for investors and most of them are aware that they 
should be in India in the medium term. This is the message we 
got in Davos," the official added. 
<H5>  Industry, Government Mix </H5>
  The second important development of the Prime Ministerial 
visit is the new relationship established between Government and 
industry. This was evident not only in Davos but also in Germany 
where the inter-mixing of the official and industrial delegation 
was so much that the entire entourage of industrial leaders 
practically became part of the Prime Minister's delegation. 
  The meeting between Indian and German industrialists in Bonn 
was held in the office of the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut 
Kohl. "This is unprecedented. Never has the NATO [North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation] room of the Chancellor's office been thrown 
open for an industrial meet," the Indian Ambassador in Bonn, Mr. 
K.S. Rana, pointed out. The second point to note was that at 
this meeting, where Mr. Rao and Mr. Kohl were present, the top 
bureaucrats of the Government of India literally took a back 
seat and were seated behind the Indian industrial delegation. 
"This too has never happened before. Imagine the Finance 
Secretary sitting behind an industrialist," one official pointed 
out. 
  "The industrialists were given the signal that they were as 
much important in selling India as an investment destination as 
the Government. This close relationship between Government and 
industry is a new development, unlike in the past when 
officialdom maintained a distance from industry," the official 
said. 
<H5>  Politically Significant </H5>
  On the political front too, Mr. Rao's second visit to 
Germany 
in a little over two years is of much significance. As is known, 
this is an election year in Germany, including that for the 
Federal Chancellery and going by indications available now, Mr. 
Kohl faces an extremely difficult task in getting re-elected. 
His bane has been the economy, which has come under severe 
pressure with the unification of West and East Germany, an 
achievement for which Mr. Kohl had taken the entire credit in 
the past. 
  Today, there is over 10 per cent unemployment in the 
country, 
the economy is expected to grow at zero per cent and interest 
rates are too high for fresh investment. In short, the economy 
is in recession and is burdened by the continuing cost of 
reconstruction of the eastern parts. 
  Mr. Rao's singular political achievement with this visit has 
been the establishment of a rapport with the entire political 
spectrum in Germany. The packed schedule that the Prime Minister 
had in Bonn was marked for the more meetings he had with 
Opposition political leaders against the one meeting with Mr. 
Kohl. Moreover, the message that Mr. Rao got from these meetings 
was that India would continue to be a priority area for Germany, 
irrespective of the Government that comes to office after the 
October elections. 
  "The Asia Policy of Mr. Kohl has national support and this 
has been confirmed by the political leaders who met the Prime 
Minister. Thus, India would remain a partner of choice and the 
strategic partnership between the two countries would remain 
unaltered even with political changes in Germany. This assurance 
has been received by India," another top official in the Prime 
Ministerial entourage said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "sm": "Installation Constructers Hope for </F>
Large-Scale Orders"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 31 January -- Economic relations will be 
the focal issue of a four-day visit to Germany by Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao to begin on Wednesday [2 February]. 
German companies hope this visit will support their efforts to 
get large-scale orders from India. In return, Rao is working 
for German investment on the subcontinent. 
  One of the central issues of the talks in Bonn is the 
participation of German companies in expanding the power supply 
in India. This involves orders worth double-digit billion sums. 
Yesterday, Indian Energy Minister Salve explained to leading 
German installation constructors in Bonn his government's plans 
for expanding the energy supply. According to him, new 
construction is planned of seven conventional power stations 
with a capacity of 5,500 megawatts and an investment of 12 
billion German marks. In addition, seven existing power 
stations are to be modernized, that is, to be equipped with 
modern environmental technology. Furthermore, it is planned to 
expand India's mains distribution. [passage omitted] 
  During his visit to Bonn, Rao will take time for a 
"German-Indian economic conference," and for individual talks 
with the directors of Hoechst, BASF, Mercedes, and Siemens as 
well as with Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech. 
  The political talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping will focus primarily on coordinating a joint 
route toward the goal of the two countries getting permanent 
seats on the UN Security Council. The Germans will also be 
urging India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- After warnings from 
Bonn because of the conflict between China and Tibet, the Dalai 
Lama, the Tibetan leader, has declined an invitation to the 
1,200th anniversary of Frankfurt/Main. The Foreign Ministry had 
warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the Dalai 
Lama and the mayor of Frankfurt's Chinese partner city of 
Guangzhou could lead to "problems." On Wednesday [16 February] 
the Dalai Lama's Swiss representative office declined the 
invitation that Frankfurt Mayor Andreas von Schoeler (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) had extended to the Dalai Lama, who 
lives in exile in India. 
  The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling for the 
reestablishment of the autonomous status of Tibet, which is 
under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office 
in Zurich says the Dalai Lama had been very sorry to hear that 
his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had 
been created without his fault "as a result of obviously 
political motives." He wants to spare the city and its 
population difficulties. He had been pleased with the 
invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In his talk with Indian Prime 
Minister P.V. Narisimha Rao, Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on 
German industry to make more investments on the subcontinent, 
which is inhabited by 900 million people. On Thursday [3 
February], the second day of his visit to Germany, which will 
last four days, Rao met in Bonn with Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and was then received 
by Kohl with military honors in front of the Chancellor's Office. 
  It has been said that in the political part of this talk 
with 
Rao, Kohl clearly expressed the Western community interest in 
having India sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Kohl had 
broached this topic already during his visit to India last 
February. During this visit representatives of German and 
Indian industry signed an agreement on building two conventional 
power plants with an order value of 5.6 billion German marks. 
  After the political exchange of opinion, Kohl and Rao opened 
a German-Indian economic conference in the Chancellor's Office, 
which is under the patronage of the "Asia-Pacific Committee" of 
German industry. Kohl cited the focal issues of cooperation, 
which he sees as part of the Federal Government's Asian concept. 
The dialogue of the consultation forum, which was established 
during Rao's first visit to Germany in 1991, must be continued 
with representatives of industry, science, and members of the 
governments. Kohl announced that a German-Indian committee for 
science and technology, which will be staffed with high-ranking 
officials from both states, will soon start its work. 
  Kohl pointed out that the FRG is currently India's second 
most important supplier and its fourth most important sales 
market. "Our investments in India are remarkable, but they 
could still increase," the chancellor said. The deregulation 
and liberalization of the Indian economy also plays a big role 
in that. The successful conclusion of the GATT round is of 
great importance for the further development of the 
German-Indian economic relations. 
  On the first day of Rao's visit the Fraunhofer Society for 
the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research" had signed an agreement on cooperation 
in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  The Indian prime minister's schedule also included meetings 
with the chairmen of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union and Free Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag 
groups as well as a continuation of the exchange of views with 
leading representatives of German industry. On Friday, Rao will 
receive Rudolf Scharping, minister-president of 
Rhineland-Palatinate and chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany, before he goes to Berlin, where he will be welcomed 
by President Richard von Weizsaecker.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
left New Delhi this morning for the United States. He was seen 
off at the airport by his cabinet colleagues, chief ministers of 
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, the governor of 
Uttar Pradesh and senior officials. The seven-day visit will 
take Mr. Narasimha Rao to four cities, including the capital 
Washington and will enable him to meet a broad segment of the 
Clinton Administration, congressmen, and business circles. 
  Our correspondent, M. Rama Rao, covering the visit, says the 
main thrust of the prime minister's talks will be on enhanced 
economic and investment cooperation between the two countries. 
India will also reiterate its position on sensitive issues like 
Nuclear Nonproliferation, arms control, human rights, and 
Kashmir to the U.S. leaders. The Clinton-Rao talks slated for 
Thursday are expected to be open and frank, giving the leaders 
an opportunity to appreciate each other's point of view on world 
issues as also matters of mutual concern. 
  A high-level official delegation is accompanying the prime 
minister. It includes the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; 
the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salaman 
Khurshid; and the minister of state in the prime minister's 
office, Mr. Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi. A 21-member trade delegation 
drawn from the three apex bodies of Indian industry is also 
accompanying the prime minister to help forge enhanced Indo-U.S. 
economic relations. The highlights of the visit include an 
address by Mr. Narasimha Rao to a joint meeting of the U.S. 
Congress and the lecture at the prestigious Harvard University.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 3 KYODO -- The Chinese Government 
will soon allow the young spiritual head of the Kagyu sect of 
Tibetan Buddhism to make his first visit to his seat in Rumtek 
monastery in northeast India, sources belonging to the sect said 
Thursday [2 June]. 
  The 11-year-old Ugyen Thinley Dorjee, whose identity as the 
reincarnation of the sect's 16th karmapa was revealed in 1992, 
currently lives in the sect's former headquarters in Tsurphu 
monastery, some 50 kilometers from the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. 
  "The Chinese Government has agreed to allow the new karmapa 
to go to India for a brief visit," the sources said. The timing 
and duration of the visit is still unknown, they said. 
  A high-level team of lamas, including Tai Situ Rimponche who 
was largely responsible for the discovery of the sect's 17th 
living god, returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi after 
successful negotiations with the Chinese Government in the last 
week of May, the sources said. 
  The reincarnation of the 16th karmapa was found with Chinese 
help through a prediction letter which Tai Situ Rimpoche, a 
regent of the last karmapa, discovered in 1989 almost a decade 
after the last karmapa's death. 
  All 15 karmapas since 1193 were identified in their 
childhood 
on the basis of prediction letters left by their predecessors. 
  However, a rival group of lamas questioning the authenticity 
of the letter this March enthroned a 10-year-old Tibetan boy, 
Tenzin Chentse, in a Buddhist monastery in New Delhi claiming he 
is the last karmapa's true reincarnation. 
  According to a Tibetan follower of the sect, it is the first 
time that two karmapas have been enthroned, although numerous 
succession struggles have occurred throughout the sect's 
900-year history. 
  Both vie for control over Rumtek monastery, which became the 
sect's center after the last Karmapa fled Tibet during the 1959 
uprising. The karmapa is considered No. 3 in Tibet's 
religio-political hierarchy after the dalai lama and the panchen 
lama. 
  By retaining the new karmapa in Tibet, Beijing is trying to 
calm the restive Tibetan populace there, one expert on Tibet 
said. 
  Beijing needs a religious figure compliant to its policies, 
with the panchen lama dead in early 1989 and no successor in 
sight, and the dalai lama remaining in his self-imposed Indian 
exile, he said.

  [Text] India is in the agonising process of an evaluation 
whether the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, should 
call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States, 
sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is 
sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly 
advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the 
vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would 
help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove 
growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. 
  If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks 
by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is 
evident that they do not see India requiring any high-level 
attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two 
decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy 
Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in 
the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any 
visits in the near future either. 
  The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to 
India. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between 
India and the United States. But all the loving and hating is 
done by India only. 
  Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent 
spate of provocative statements from the White House and the 
State Department makes it all the more imperative for Mr 
Narasimha Rao to meet the top U.S. leadership and other opinion 
makers in the country. They point out that such 
misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest 
political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake 
if he did not do so because of false prestige. 
  If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of 
President Clinton were responsible for pushing this 
administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis India, a 
personal encounter between him and Mr Rao may well restore the 
balance. Moreover, Prime Minister Rao would also have the 
opportunity in Washington to meet influential Congressmen, 
Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain New 
Delhi's case on Kashmir, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
(NPT) and a host of other contentious issues. 
  Those who support Mr Narasimha Rao's going to Washington are 
convinced that he would get strong backing from the business 
lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of 
the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is 
perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this 
should enable him [to] project a progressive image of India in 
the United States as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about 
human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab as well as on 
nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent. 
  Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in 
Beijing which has managed to deflect criticism on the human 
rights front by luring big American business with tempting 
investment prospects in China. A similar gambit by Narasimha 
Rao, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with U.S. 
businessmen pressurising the Clinton Administration to stop 
making provocative statements and gestures against this country. 
  The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by Mr 
Narasimha Rao is that if he refused to go to Washington out of 
pique with the Clinton administration, it would only allow 
Pakistan--its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, is also 
scheduled to visit the United States within a few months--a free 
propaganda run. It is felt that Ms Bhutto would then use this to 
project New Delhi as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like 
Kashmir and NPT. 
  Those who are against the Prime Minister going to 
Washington, 
however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that 
in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when 
there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between 
Washington and New Delhi, a Prime Ministerial visit could be 
counterproductive with only the differences between two 
countries getting articulated. 
  Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on 
bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative 
pronouncements on India from the Clinton Administration, 
including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere 
visit to Washington by Mr Narasimha Rao. In fact, there is a 
possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working 
out a compromise at the moment. 
  There is also the question of personal vibes between Mr 
Narasimha Rao and the U.S. President. Both leaders come from 
different generations and cultures with clashing styles and 
world views. 
  While it is possible that a leader like Rajiv Gandhi may 
have 
hit it off with President Clinton, this appears to be far more 
unlikely in the case of Prime Minister Rao. Even if there are no 
open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal 
encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory, 
resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao's mild professorial style, however 
impressive to the knowledgeable on India affairs, is also 
unlikely to attract much media attention in the United States. 
This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with Ms Bhutto's visit 
which is bound to cause more flutter in the U.S. media. 
  In any case, the flamboyant young Harvard educated leader 
has 
many more personal friends in the U.S. establishment, 
particularly in the Clinton Administration. Under the 
circumstances, Mr Narasimha Rao, if he goes to Washington, would 
be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani 
counterpart. 
  Significantly, most officials both in the Foreign Office and 
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic 
about Mr Narasimha Rao visiting Washington at this point. While 
the Foreign Office is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful 
Prime Ministerial visit to the United States further 
complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between 
New Delhi, Washington and Islamabad, the PMO is apprehensive 
about the political repurcussions at home in the event of Mr 
Narasimha Rao failing to pull off a public relations coup with 
President Clinton. 
  There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country 
today, 
including the national media, which closely follows the progress 
of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the 
success or failure of Mr Rao's visit in all probability would be 
exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead 
or not with his trip to the United States may have far less 
impact on bilateral ties than other factors. Mr Rao would have 
to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix 
dates for the proposed visit. 
  This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who 
has been pressing for a visit to Washington for the past many 
months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to 
Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to Mr 
Rao's cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in 
Beijing and Tehran and Davos. 
  A failure or even a damp squib in Washington, on the other 
hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime 
Minister Rao but also further add to the mounting strident 
anti-U.S. chorus in this country.

<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "Germany Will Stay Neutral on </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 3--India has conveyed to the German 
Government the latest position in the bilateral talks with 
Pakistan at the Foreign Secretary level, held in Islamabad this 
January and the follow-up in terms of exchange of "Non-papers." 
  At Germany's request, India has given a summary of the 
discussions that took place. Also handed over are copies of two 
non-papers presented by Pakistan, including the one on 
plebiscite in Kashmir, which were subsequently rejected by 
India, and the six Indian proposals pertaining to 
confidence-building measures aimed at improving bilateral 
relations. 
  These documents were handed over during the Foreign 
Secretary-level discussions here on Wednesday. The Indian side 
was led by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, who 
flew into Bonn to be part of the Prime Ministerial delegation. 
Wednesday's discussions were the fourth in a series of talks 
structured by India and Germany for closer political contacts. 
The earlier three rounds were conducted by the then Foreign 
Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and his predecessor, Mr. Muchkund 
Dubey. 
  Though maintaining a neutral stance on Kashmir and 
Indo-Pakistan relations in general, Germany is interested in 
seeing an early resolution of the problem and improvement in 
ties between Delhi and Islamabad. The same dilemma confronts 
Germany over Pakistan's strident propaganda against India on the 
question of alleged human rights abuses. 
  The talks here took notice of the shrill speech by the 
Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, at the Human Rights 
Conference in Geneva on Tuesday, when India conveyed its 
displeasure at the Pakistani move to try and get a resolution 
passed against it. The Indian side has conveyed to Germany what 
New Delhi's attitude would be if the resolution is indeed moved 
and the consequences. 
  In response, Germany, typically, remained non-committal, 
saying it was neutral on the issue and added that moving such a 
resolution would not help in improving Indo-Pakistan bilateral 
relations. 
  The other matter that came up for discussion pertained to 
the 
restructuring of the United Nations. Germany already filed 
papers for election as a non-permanent member in the Security 
Council and solicited Indian support. India kept its options 
open, saying many others had filed papers and a final decision 
on supporting a particular country would be taken later. The 
decision would, of course, depend on the status of India's 
bilateral relations with the contending countries, it was said. 
  Strategic alliance: According to observers, the 
significance of the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's visit to 
this country twice within a short span of two years is part of a 
strategic alliance India and Germany want to form. While trade 
and economic exchanges are in the forefront of such an alliance, 
the political aspect is equally significant. 
  India, on the other hand, is keen on taking advantage of 
Germany's new Asia policy under which it wants to focus on the 
continent with emphasis on China, Japan and India. India, 
therefore, wants closer political contacts with an emerging 
global power as well as one of the key nations of Europe. 
  The idea is to have greater interaction so that Germany will 
have a better perception of the Indian position on various 
thorny issues, including Kashmir and human rights, which are 
being internationalised. The fact that Mr. Kohl in particular 
and Germany in general enjoy a good rapport with the United 
States administration under Mr. Bill Clinton is also taken note 
of. 
  To keep up political contacts, with Germany a series of 
bilateral visits has been planned for the current year, though 
this is year of elections, also involving the offices of 
President and Chancellor, are to be held in Germany. 
  Talks at the level of officials are also on for finalising 
treaties on double taxation avoidance and extradition and a 
bilateral agreement for investment guarantee.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Goodwill Gesture"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese ambassador, Mr Cheng Ruisheng's 
statement, that Beijing is soon likely to officially recognise 
Sikkim's merger with India, is further good tidings for New 
Delhi and indicates that India can now look forward to the 
dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from 
past hostility between the two countries. Ever since Indira 
Gandhi's decision to make the "Protectorate" of Sikkim a State 
of the Republic in 1975, Beijing has steadfastly questioned the 
legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the 
Himalayan kingdom's merger with India and whether or not a 
sovereign nation had been subjugated, Beijing was bothered by 
the disappearance of a buffer between India and China. After 
all, Sikkim had been the gateway to Tibet and its merger with 
India meant pushing the Indian frontier that much forward. 
Indeed, Chinese unhappiness with the turn of the events was 
reflected in Beijing's refusal to acknowledge Sikkim as a part 
of the Indian Union, a view which has been repeatedly expressed 
over the years. 
  It was Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China that led to a softening 
in Beijing's stand on Sikkim insofar as any official mention of 
the protectorate's merger with India was concerned. It is 
possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy 
with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures 
on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal 
of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting 
Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China 
last year which led to the Sino- Indian agreement on maintaining 
peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, 
second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent 
the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have 
contributed towards an upswing in Sino-Indian relations to the 
detriment of America's hegemonistic designs in the region, an 
added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan-China axis. 
  True, Beijing's official recognition of Sikkim's merger will 
not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino-Indian 
relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth 
road to solving the vexatious border dispute. At the same time, 
the benefits of narrowing down differences in other areas by 
stepping around what is apparently an intractable problem cannot 
be over- emphasised. Some problems will continue to plague 
Sino-Indian relations and both New Delhi and Beijing will have 
to learn to cope with them if a lasting relation is to be forged 
between the two Asian giants. For instance, Beijing will have 
to stop doubting New Delhi's official position on Tibet -- that 
it is an autonomous zone of China -- and accept the 
inevitability of pluralism in a democratic society. By 
cavilling at views on Tibet's future expressed by individuals at 
seminars and rallies, like it did recently, Beijing will be 
running the risk of setting the clock back. A better option 
would be to hasten the reopening of the silk route which once 
connected two civilisations.

   Thousands of Tibetans threw flowers and
offered silk scarves in a tumultous welcome Tuesday for their
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who returned to his home-in-exile
with the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama arrived at New Delhi's international airport just
past midnight and was greeted by cheering men, women and children
from the 100,000-member Tibetan community exiled in India.
   Inside the airport's arrival lounge, monks in maroon and saffron
robes lined up to welcome the 54-year-old Dalai Lama with low bows
and traditional gifts of white scarves. Outside, thousands of
Tibetans lighted incense sticks and covered the roadway with
marigold and rose petals.
   ``I feel (the award) is recognition of my sincerest motivation
for nonviolent action,'' the leader of Tibet's resistance to
Chinese rule told reporters. ``I feel it may help to create more
awareness for the value of compassion and nonviolence.''
   When he was awarded the prize in Oslo, Norway, on Oct. 5, the
Dalai Lama was in California on one of the U.S. visits he makes at
least twice a year to minister to Buddhist faithful and to heighten
international awareness of the Tibetan struggle. He spent four
weeks in the United States on this trip.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the 1951 Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
He has set up a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, an Indian town
300 miles north of New Delhi.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that China retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   So far, there has been no concession by China. The Beijing
government has said it is willing to discuss Tibet. However, it
insists Tibet must remain an integral part of China.
   Asked whether his receiving the 1989 Nobel Prize could alter
Beijing's stance, the Dalai Lama said: ``At the moment, I don't
know. But after a few months you may see something.'' He did not
elaborate.
   China has condemned the award as an insult and interference in
its internal affairs.
   The Dalai Lama, dressed in the sleeveless robes of an ordinary
Buddhist monk and wearing a rosary on his left wrist, said he had
still not decided what to do with the award's $469,000 cash prize.
   ``I may contribute something for the starving people in Africa
or create an institution for world peace,'' he said. ``I need some
more ideas. I will speak to my colleagues.''

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (AFP)--China strongly criticized 
India Tuesday [22 March] for failing to prevent a recent 
conference on Tibet from being held in New Delhi, slamming the 
event as a "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "We 
deeply deplore that such anti-China political activities had not 
been forestalled on the territory of India," said a foreign 
ministry spokesman, referring to last week's All-Party Indian 
Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. 
  The three-day convention, attended by parliamentarians from 
30 countries, "openly trumpeted for `liberation of Tibet' on the 
grounds that there were human rights problems in Tibet," the 
spokesman said. "This anti-China act and gross interference in 
China' internal affairs has aroused great indignation of the 
whole Chinese people including the Tibetan compatriots," he said. 
  The conference statement denounced alleged Chinese human 
rights abuses in Tibet, urged the release of all Tibetan 
political prisoners and expressed concern over Chinese nuclear 
testing in the region -- which Chinese troops entered in 1951. 
It also called on China to open unconditional talks with the 
Dalai Lama and urged the United Nations to grant observer status 
to the Tibetan spiritual leader's government-in-exile, based in 
northern India but not recognised by any country. 
  "We thoroughly condemn the anti-China clamours made at the 
meeting," which was organised by "a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international 
anti-Chinese force," said the foreign ministry spokesman. 
  The Indian government has also come under fire from 
conference delegates, who accuse it of succumbing to Chinese 
pressure by trying to scuttle the event by denying a venue in 
the heart of New Delhi and by allegedly declining visas to some 
MPs. "The (Indian) government put obstacles at the behest of 
China. China twisted India's arm," said Indian MP George 
Fernandes Sunday, calling on the Indian government to support 
the Tibetan cause. Fernandes said the Dalai Lama, who has 
lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed 
anti-Chinese revolt, did not make an appearance at the 
convention because of Indian pressures. 
  India, which is home to some 100,000 Tibetan exiles, treats 
Tibet as an autonomous region of China and has cracked down 
hard on Tibetan protestors during visits by Chinese leaders in 
recent years.

  [Text] The Czech president, Dr. Vaclav Havel, has been 
presented with the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament, 
and Development for the year 1993. Presenting the prestigious 
award at the Ashoka Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House] 
in New Delhi today, the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, 
described Mr. Havel as a champion of human rights. He said Dr. 
Havel has done a (?signal) service in providing politics its 
moral dimension. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, said India has an exemplary record on human rights. He 
said the aspersion on India's record on this issue is caused by 
those who themselves do not have any respect for human dignity. 
Mr. Rao described the president of the new republic as the 
father of democratic movement in Europe. The award carries 25 
lakh rupees and a plaque. 
  The Czech president described the award as the best tribute 
to the people of his country, who waged a relentless struggle 
against the totalitarian regime through nonviolence. The vice 
president, Mr. Dr. K.R. Narayanan, and the chairperson of the 
Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, also spoke on 
the occasion. 
  Later, addressing a press conference, Dr. Vaclav Havel said 
there is great potential for economic cooperation between India 
and his country. He observed that both countries are pursuing 
economic reforms and there is a need for exchanging information 
about the opportunities available in each country. In this 
regard, Mr. Havel sought to have an investment protection 
agreement with India and hoped that the draft agreement 
submitted by his delegation in this regard will be formalized by 
the middle of this year. Expressing his satisfaction at the 
discussions with the Indian leaders and businessmen, he said two 
agreements on trade and avoidance of double taxation have been 
signed. 
  Replying to a question on supplying spare parts to Indian 
defense equipment, Mr. Havel said there is no reason why his 
country should not export defense equipment to peace-loving 
democratic countries. He, however, firmly said that the Czech 
Republic will not export defense equipment to some countries 
which were receiving armaments from the former Czechoslovakia. 
The deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Ivan 
Kocarnik, said companies from his country will now onwards 
participate in tenders for projects in India. A delegation of 
Indian businessmen will visit Prague soon to establish relations 
with the Czech businessmen. 
  Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the 
visiting Czech president, Dr. Havel, discussed the possibilities 
of cooperation in several areas between the two countries at 
their meeting in New Delhi today. Mr. Rao said India was 
particularly interested in the cooperation in infrastructure 
development. The two leaders deliberated on the role and 
relevance of the United Nations. Mr. Rao said India was 
committed to the UN and its democratization. He also accepted 
the Czech president's invitation to visit the Czech Republic.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
underlined the importance of economic relations between Germany 
and India. Kohl said today at the start of a German-Indian 
economic conference at the Bonn Chancellery, in the presence of 
Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narisimha Rao, that this conference 
underlined the "special importance" that the German Government 
attached to relations between the two countries. 
  Rao arrived in Germany for a two-day visit to Bonn on 2 
February. Kohl welcomed the prime minister with military honors 
this morning at the Chancellery. Afterward they met for talks. 
Rao is also to visit Berlin on the 4th and 5th February. 
  At the economic conference, the chancellor said that 
relations between Germany and India in the science and 
technology areas had always been very close and are 
characterized by cooperation in a spirit of trust on many 
projects. Kohl announced that it was agreed today to set up a 
high-level German-Indian Commission for Science and Technology. 
Mutual economic relations had developed "gratifyingly" in the 
past few years. Today, Germany was India's second most 
important supplier and fourth most important market. German 
investments in India were "considerable, but could still 
increase." 
  Rao welcomed German industry's Asian offensive. This project 
was appropriate to the positive economic developments in Asia, 
he said. 
  The economic conference, the climax of Rao's visit, was 
opened by Siemens head Heinrich von Pierer, the chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Association of German industry. A large number of 
Indian and German business representatives took part in the 
conference. [passage omitted]

<TEXT>     "The answer, which we already have, was no," he said.;   He said China
rebuffed the offer because "Tibetans are still fighting for their
independence.";   An aide said the Dalai Lama last met a Chinese prime
minister in 1954.;   The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India in 1959 after a
failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupation. He has not returned
since.;   The Buddhist monk, considered the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai
Lama by his followers, said he wants to visit his homeland, but only if China
allows him to move freely.;   Tenzin Geyche Tethong, his personal secretary,
said the Dalai Lama hopes pro-democracy reforms in Eastern Europe and other
parts of the world will spread to China.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  P.V. Narasimha Rao, a former foreign minister and loyalist of slain Congress
Party leader Rajiv Gandhi, was appointed prime minister-designate today and
charged with forming the next government.;    President Ramaswamy Venkataraman
chose Rao and gave him four weeks to present a government to Parliament and
prove it can command a majority.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RAO APPOINTED INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER-DESIGNATE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I feel humble and confident," Rao said after meeting the president at his
official mansion.;    The appointment followed Rao's unanimous selection for
the post by the Congress Party's newly elected parliamentary delegation. That
occurred after rival Sharad Pawar said he was withdrawing his candidacy for
the sake of party unity. Pawar, a powerful Bombay-based politician, is chief
minister of the western state of Maharashtra.;    "As an individual, I feel
overwhelmed. As the representative of a great party, I feel like a colossus,"
Rao said in accepting the party's nomination.;    Congress won the lion's
share of votes in national elections that concluded Saturday, but fell short
of a majority. Rao's first task will be to shore up his government, either in
a coalition or by guaranteeing reliable support from an outside party for a
minority government.;    Leftist parties and the centrist National Front
alliance say they will back a Congress government on the merits of each issue.
But none has shown interest in joining a coalition committed to blanket
support to the government.;    Until Pawar's withdrawal, the party had feared
a bitter power struggle among regional leaders. Rao is a veteran politician
from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh who was foreign minister under Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    After Indira Gandhi's 1984 assassination, Rao
remained in the Cabinet under Rajiv Gandhi, who served as prime minister from
his mother's death until 1989.;    The party leadership fell vacant when Rajiv
Gandhi was assassinated May 21 while attempting a political comeback, and Rao
was chosen party president after Gandhi's Italian-born widow, Sonia, refused
to accept the post.;    After a show of hands confirmed Rao's election as
prime minister today, the meeting chairman, Sita Ram Desari said: "I declare
Mr. Narasimha Rao unanimously elected as leader of the Congress parliamentary
party.";    Rao's selection was greeted with cheers and shouts of "Rajiv
Gandhi is immortal.";    Referring to Gandhi, Rao told the 200 Congress
delegates that "sometimes the responsibilities of the great fall on someone
who is not great. Since you cannot bring them back, you just have to carry
on.";    He added: "We owe it Rajiv Gandhi, to his memory, to the party and to
the country to implement his manifesto to the hilt.";    Rao, who is 69 and
has undergone a heart bypass operation, did not run for a seat in Parliament.
Indian law requires the head of government to be a member of Parliament, and
he must win a by-election within six months.;    The governing party can
guarantee a victory by running Rao in a constituency vacated by the death of a
lawmaker, or by having a party member resign in a district where Congress
would be judged a shoo-in.;    Pawar endorsed Rao's election, citing Rao's
five decades of experience in the party and in government. "His total
contribution to the Congress Party is more than my age," said Pawar, who is
50.;    Rao had played a key role in the election campaign, writing the
party's manifesto, which calls for encouraging high-tech foreign investment
while remaining committed to the longstanding notion of a self-sufficient
economy.  </TEXT>

  [Excerpts] The prime minister has declared that his 
government will go ahead with the economic liberalization 
process, ensuring that Indianness and identity of the nation is 
not diminished in any way. He said the present transition in 
the economic sector aims at accomplishing a liberal trading 
regime to overcome the macroeconomic crisis. 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the historic Humboldt 
University in Berlin today. He called for a determined fight 
against prejudices to help create a new humanism based on trust 
and respect for one another. He said we should live up to our 
worthy heritage by harmonizing our energies to promote 
Indo-German relations. The prime minister said it is a matter 
of pride for him to be in a free, united Berlin. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to inaugurate the Indian 
Cultural Center at Berlin later tonight, before leaving for New 
Delhi at the end of his four-day state visit to Germany. 
  Briefing newsmen, an official spokesman described the prime 
minister's visit to Germany as a landmark. He said the German 
industry and business got the opportunity to have an in-depth 
understanding of what is happening in India on the 
liberalization front. He said the meetings the prime minister 
had with German industrialists provided an opportunity for 
face-to-face interaction.

<HEAD>Gandhi Arrives in China in First Such Visit in 34 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi arrived in the
Chinese capital Monday in the first visit to China by an Indian
leader since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, came 34 years ago.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing on a special Air India jet provided for
the trip. His usual plane remained in New Delhi because rats had
gnawed electrical cables in the aircraft.
   The five-day visit marks the first time the leaders of the
world's two most populous countries have met since 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. China has about 1.08 billion
people, and India has about 880 million.
   Gandhi will meet with the communist government's leaders in
Beijing, tour the ancient city of Xian and visit Shanghai.
   On arrival at the airport, the Indian prime minister, wearing a
brown overcoat, was greeted by about 100 Indians who live in
Beijing. He made no statement to reporters.
   Before leaving his country, Gandhi said the visit will be ``very
important ... for this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade, and science and technology. Consular offices
in the Chinese city of Shanghai and the Indian city of Bombay may
also be established as a result.
   However, little progress is expected on the main issue dividing
the two countries, their 2,400-mile-long border. They fought a brief
border war in 1962, and China occupied about 15,000 square miles of
Indian territory that India still wants back.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but made little
progress in eight rounds.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after China's 1949 revolution.
   In the early 1960s, relations deteriorated over the border issue
as well as personal and political disagreements between Chinese
leader Mao Tse-tung and Prime Minister Nehru.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations, instead of
exporting communist revolution.
   Both Chinese and Indian officials say Gandhi's visit is intended
to create an atmosphere for greater communication _ not resolve the
border question.

   With most of the votes now tallied, India's election
victors are struggling to splice together the country's
fourth government in 19 months. What kind of government it
will be now becomes the crucial question for India.
   The biggest winner, the traditionally dominant Congress
(I) Party, had only one candidate who seemed to have learned
enough both from past successes and mistakes to offer a
chance of hauling India into the modern world. That was
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whose five-year term
ended with the loss of his party's parliamentary majority in
1989. Mr. Gandhi was courting voters this round with promises
to resume his mid-1980s drive for a more open economy when he
was assassinated May 21 at a campaign rally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since Mr. Gandhi's murder, his Congress Party has been
trying frantically to scrounge up a viable nominee for prime
minister. Mr. Gandhi's replacement as Congress Party
president, 69-year-old P.V. Narasimha Rao, is in bad health
and seems to be serving mainly as a place holder. The mission
of finding a lasting party leader has become urgent now that
the projected vote totals show Congress short of a majority,
but with enough seats to negotiate the leadership of a new
coalition government.
   To form a government, Congress members face the double
challenge of drumming up a viable prime minister as well as
pasting together a majority coalition over which this mystery
minister could preside. Small wonder that with the top
politicians so befuddled, the June 15 edition of one of the
country's leading magazines, India Today, refers to India as
"one of the most ungovernable countries in the world."
   Fortunately, India still has one ace in the hole -- its
voters. With each creak and heave of the three recent
administrations, voters seem to have been getting a sharper
idea of what they want -- and what they are fed up with. If
the politicians would stop squabbling long enough to heed the
message of the recent polls, they might find that India's 835
million people are trying to steer their country in a more
governable direction.
   What voters clearly don't want is the old-style
poverty-making state planning, which mainly promotes economic
stagnation, corruption, frustration and resulting ethnic
strife.
   The steps needed for economic development are by now no
secret. The world has seen enough socialist experiments fail
-- from India's democratic version to the Soviet Union's and
China's more hideous communist models. We have all marveled
at the rise since World War II of Asia's capitalist tiger
economies. Even India's traditionally statist neighbors in
Pakistan and Bangladesh have been turning recently toward
more free-market ways. When Rajiv Gandhi pointed in that
direction for two years or so in the mid-1980s, Indians were
clearly ready to follow; they responded with a burst of
economic growth. Now they want more.
   Rajiv Gandhi died while seeking what he called a "second
chance" to pursue the reforms that would let India fulfill
its huge potential as the most populous of the world's
democratic, developing nations. The challenge for the
jostling Congress leaders who survive Mr. Gandhi is to redeem
his free-market election pledge that has won them this second
chance.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement 
of Dharamsala in northern India was calm Sunday [24 April], but 
tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight 
triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here. 
  The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile issued an appeal to the 
residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during 
this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual 
leader's office in New Delhi said Sunday. 
  Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts 
of 
violence from anyone" and the Indians in Dharamsala were asked 
to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two 
communities. 
  Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a 
hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people 
injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks 
went on the rampage Friday. 
  The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old 
Indian 
youth in a knife fight Thursday night with a Tibetan refugee, 
who also was injured and hospitalised. 
  Police reinforcements have reached Dharamsala, where the 
authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a 
Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the 
Dalai Lama's office said. 
  "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there 
is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian 
leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the 
rioting. 
  He said the incident which sparked the riots was an 
altercation between two individuals and "no one should take 
steps which will result in communal tension." 
  Dharamsala has been home to the Dalai Lama and the seat of 
his government-in-exile since he fled Tibet in 1959 following an 
abortive anti-Chinese uprising. India is home to about 100,000 
Tibetan exiles. 
  The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the United 
States and expected to return May 1. 
  His government-in-exile used Sunday's statement to express 
Tibetan gratitude to India for "coming to our help at this 
critical period in our history." 
  "Tibet and India have had close spiritual and cultural ties 
for centuries," the statement said. "The Dalai Lama has always 
been reminding our people that the relationship between India 
and Tibet is that of a teacher and a disciple."

<TEXT>     Nearly 300 people were killed during the campaign and the voting, making it
the most violent balloting since India gained independence 44 years ago.;   
The latest victim was a parliament candidate from Punjab state who was killed
today in a bomb blast in his home, Press Trust of India reported.;   
Elections in Punjab are scheduled Saturday for both Parliament and the state
legislature. Punjab was given a later date than the rest of this nation of 844
million people in order to bolster security measures.;    Sikh militias
campaigning for an independent nation have vowed to stop the elections. So far
they have killed three candidates for Parliament and at least 19 for the state
legislature.;    The Congress Party, which has ruled India for 40 years, will
dominate Parliament but was projected to fall about 40 seats short of the 256
needed for a majority, state-run television said.;    Small-party allies and
independents could give Congress an additional 20 supporters in the Lok Sabha,
or the House of the People. It would, therefore, need to court coalition
partners among its political rivals.;    Party President P.V. Narasimha Rao
said Congress would try to choose its leader in Parliament. Rao spoke in the
drawing room of his New Delhi bungalow after meeting a half-dozen other party
bosses.;    The Indian Express newspaper today said Rao and regional leader
Sharad Pawar were in the running to be the next prime minister.;    Pawar is
the chief minister, the top elected official, of western Maharashtra state,
whose capital is Bombay. He was considered in a strong position because the
Congress Party won 37 of the state's 47 parliamentary districts.;    "The
process of consultation is on, but we have nothing definite to offer," party
spokesman Pranab Mukherjee said today. "The election of the leader will have
to wait until all the results are declared.";    The counting is not expected
to be completed until Wednesday.;    With 438 of the 511 seats at stake
decided, the Congress won 213, television reported. Its small-party allies won
another 12. Partial returns from other districts showed the Congress would win
only about 15 of the remaining 73 seats, television said.  </TEXT>

  [Text] The prime minister returned to New Delhi this 
morning on the completion of his week-long visit to the United 
States. Mr. Narasimha Rao was received at the airport by the 
home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan; the civil aviation and tourism 
minister, Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad; and the Harayana chief minister, 
Mr. Bhajan Lal, besides others. 
  As reported the prime minister's arrival in New Delhi was 
slightly delayed as Air India's special aircraft carrying him 
and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while 
landing at Paris for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft 
already stationed at Charles de Gaulle Airport was used for the 
onward journey home. 
  India-American business leaders have proposed creating two 
new institutions on Wall Street in New York to chalk out 
programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by 
the Greater Houston Partnership, the plan was presented to the 
finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who accompanied the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his just concluded U.S. visit. 
A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages 
creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and 
equity instruments to raise capital for India in the next 
decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least $100 
billion by the U.S. private industries for Indian markets in the 
next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the 
capacity to fund $5 billion per year for the modernization of 
the country's industry. 
  The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Atal 
behari Vajpayee, has lauded the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, for not succumbing to U.S. pressure on the issues of 
Kashmir and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Talking to 
newsmen in Lucknow, Mr. Vajpayee expressed satisfaction on the 
firm stand taken on these points.

  [Text] Koenigswinter (DPA) -- The Dalai Lama has 
encouraged the FRG to take over responsibility in international 
politics. He hopes that, as a result of its special historical 
development, Germany will play an important role in establishing 
world peace, the secular and spiritual head of Tibet said in 
Koenigswinter near Bonn on Saturday [30 April]. 
  The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India for 35 
years, 
pointed to the "particularly friendly relations" between Germany 
and China. However, this should not lead to a strong tolerance 
toward the Chinese Government. Germany has the opportunity to 
influence Chinese policy. The 58-year-old man stressed that 
awareness of the special situation in his homeland is widespread 
among the German public. 
  The Nobel Peace Prize laureate affirmed his path of 
nonviolence. "I am, on principle, against the use of weapons." 
This is also the basis of the support granted to the Tibetan 
people by the world public. The Dalai Lama is paying a 
three-day visit to Germany on the invitation of the 
Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, which is affiliated with the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles

Army troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' Gorbachev said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to India.
   The Soviet Union agreed in April to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in December 1979 and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of Estonia to Kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
Estonia's parliament this week declared Estonia was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Gorbachev said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the Soviet
Union, China and India were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with China are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the Soviet Union, India and China,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of Asia and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is scheduled to visit
Moscow early next year.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have had long-standing border
problems with China. India and China fought a brief war in 1962 over
the issue.
   Gorbachev's comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to Mrs. Gandhi, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, placed a wreath of red
roses at Mrs. Gandhi's memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, and to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the hero of India's
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in New Delhi under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of
Soviet-Indian relations. In an apparent reference to China,
Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third countries''
would not affect the Kremlin's friendly ties with India.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have showed signs of easing
long-standing strains in relations with China, prompting concerns
expressed by some Indian newspapers and some Indian officials about
shifts in the political balances in Asia.

<TEXT>     Final, official results were not expected to be known in all of the
contests until today or Wednesday. As of Monday, Gandhi's party, the
century-old Congress, had clearly emerged as the nation's largest single
political force.;    But results from most of the 511 seats at stake in the
national Parliament indicated that the long-ruling party would still fall
short of a majority, with a final total of about 220 seats. And several
Congress leaders have made clear that, while picking a leader behind closed
doors, they will also be discussing possible alliances, either through
political defection or horse-trading, that would break the parliamentary
deadlock and give Congress sufficient strength to rule.;    The process may
last for several days, deepening the concern of an already cynical electorate.
After the bloodiest election campaign in India's 44 years of independence
claimed more than 300 lives and left India deeply polarized, voters turned out
in the lowest numbers ever.;    Most Congress leaders were cagey about their
next moves as the final returns were coming in Monday night.;    Many of the
party's younger, regional power brokers have said that they wanted the party's
next leader to be selected by secret ballot.;    Without such a secret ballot,
most party insiders said, the most likely "consensus" candidate for a future
Congress prime minister, to be chosen by an 18-member committee dominated by
veteran followers of Gandhi's family, is 70-year-old veteran legislator P.V.

<F P=106> [By Suman Chattopadhya] </F>
  [Text] The Rao-Clinton joint news conference just 
concluded. When all of us were coming down the stairs of the 
White House after the conference, a young journalist from 
Gujarat, who was a member of the prime minister's entourage, 
loudly told a senior journalist from THE WASHINGTON POST, "Had 
this been our country then at least for the sake of courtesy, we 
would have asked your president some questions, but you have 
insulted our prime minister by not asking him any questions." 
The American journalist was not at all offended by this remark. 
He smiled and softly told the youth to come with his prime 
minister when he visits the White House after five years. He 
then added that at that time, you will not find us as 
indifferent. 
  This spontaneous anger of the unexperienced Indian 
journalist 
was 100 percent genuine. It is really difficult for 
professional Indian journalists to tolerate the disregard shown 
toward their prime minister by American journalists. This 
proves that American journalists do not give any importance to 
the country where about one sixth of the total world population 
lives. 
  Rajiv Gandhi was able to create a lot of enthusiasm in the 
U.S. media during his first visit to the United States in 1985, 
but Narasimha Rao failed to generate even a fraction of that 
enthusiasm. The major U.S. newspapers gave wide coverage to the 
press conference which was addressed by Rajiv Gandhi at the 
National Press Club in Washington. This time, the newspapers 
thought it a waste to spare space to cover Rao. During Rajiv 
Gandhi's visit, THE NEW YORK TIMES criticized the Reagan 
administration for trying to impress Gandhi by showing robots to 
him. The newspaper said "India must be reckoned with in deeper 
terms than by displaying robots or space capsules to as 
sophisticated a man as Rajiv Gandhi." This time, due to the 
request made by the Indian Embassy, only THE WASHINGTON POST 
agreed to write a short report on Rao's visit. It wrote: "A 
small bald figure in a Congress Party grey suit, a man with a 
shy manner and a low voice, a man who is a total stranger to the 
(?sound bite) [as published], the Indian prime minister is not 
easily recognizable as a politician." It is unfortunate for the 
senior, learned, and experienced prime minister of India that 
popular television networks like NBC or ABC did not feel it 
necessary to give even one minute's coverage to him. 
  Did Rao really deserve the neglect which was shown him by 
the 
U.S. media? Rajiv Gandhi was able to attract American 
journalists due to his amiable disposition, westernized outlook, 
and alluring personality. Rao had something valuable in his 
pocket which the Americans should have been attracted to, that 
is, a market economy. The media did not give much importance to 
Narasimha Rao this time as they are not very aware of the 
developments which are taking place in the Indian subcontinent. 
Despite this, there is no denying the fact that India will soon 
become very important to the U.S. media just as China has 
become. The Clinton administration was reluctant to give most 
favored nation treatment to Beijing as its human rights record 
was not satisfactory. This enraged the U.S. media. The U.S. 
media is of the opinion that nothing should be done which would 
hamper bilateral trade ties with China. 
  Americans continuously shed tears for the cause of 
democracy, 
but why is the U.S. media so keen to keep the communist 
dictators of Beijing happy. This is so because their only 
objective is trade. If Beijing does not get most favored nation 
status due to the rashness of Clinton, then U.S. industrialists 
will be affected and the interests of the country will be 
hampered. Their main objective is to protect the economic 
interests of the United States. It should be achieved at any 
cost even if it is necessary to renounce the country's policies. 
It has been observed that Beijing did not make any special 
efforts to secure most favored nation status. The industrial 
corporations and the U.S. media are working together to protect 
the interests of the Chinese leaders, Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. 
  India will also be able to acquire this importance after 
the United States becomes involved in its market. The first and 
foremost requirement is to attract U.S. capital. During his 
visit to the United States, to some extent Narasimha Rao has 
been able to attract U.S. businessmen to India. This is the 
most significant aspect of his visit to that country. These 
people were able to realize the amount of profit they can make 
by investing in India. It is true they have been impressed by 
the reform measures initiated by Rao and Manmohan. U.S. 
businessmen have started realizing that this country of hermits 
and snake charmers have a middle class population of about 200 
million people, who have great purchasing power. There was no 
one in the United States to speak in favor of India in the past. 
At present, a lobby of industrialists has been formed in favor 
of India. Some key persons of giant U.S. corporations have also 
joined this group. A new horizon of prospects has been created 
in front of their eyes -- the largest free market of the 21st 
century. 
  Their eagerness towards this country is new and it must be 
admitted that India will gain from it. The first benefit is 
economic. This is because India is desperately in need of 
foreign capital, particularly in the sphere of infrastructure. 
The second gain is political. Due to growing U.S. interests in 
India, other sensitive political issues like Kashmir and the 
nonproliferation issue will gradually lose significance. 
President Clinton and his colleagues did not make any attempt 
to embarrass Rao on these issues during his recent visit. The 
main reason behind this is pressure from industrialists. If the 
United States remains passive on these issues, then Islamabad 
will have to suffer. In fact, it is the intention of India to 
blunt the sharp mouth of Islamabad. 
  To sum up, it may be said that in this post Cold War era, it 
is essential to improve ties with the United States. It is 
necessary to play the economic card well to establish this 
relationship. Narasimha Rao's visit has created prospects for 
the establishment of friendly relations between the two 
countries. This relationship will be further strengthened if 
the pledges given by Rao and Manmohan regarding economic reforms 
are speedily implemented. Once capital is invested in this 
country, then it is bound to influence the White House and the 
U.S. media. After this, if the Indian prime minister goes to 
address a joint news conference with the U.S. president, then 
all cameras will be focussed on the Indian prime minister. This 
will fulfill the predictions made by the American journalist to 
the Gujarati youth.
