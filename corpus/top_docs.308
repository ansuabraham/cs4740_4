   When Johnny Sylvester's father wanted a second
opinion about his sick boy, he consulted Babe Ruth. The baseball
legend's treatment was unorthodox _ a 1926 World Series home run.
   John Dale Sylvester, 74, died Monday. But Ruth's purported
promise and delivery of a home run lives on, memorialized in
newspapers, biographies and on film, though wildly distorted.
   ``So many things about Babe Ruth have become like Greek
mythology,'' baseball historian Don Honig said after hearing of
Sylvester's death.
   Sylvester died at a hospital on New York's Long Island. No cause
of death was given.
   According to news reports from the time, Sylvester was kicked in
the head by a horse, suffering a life-threatening injury which left
the 11-year-old boy bedridden in Essex Fells, N.J.
   Johnny reportedly told his father, Manhattan bank vice president
Horace Sylvester, ``Gee, I wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a
homer before I die.''
   The elder Sylvester contacted Ruth's team, the New York Yankees,
in St. Louis via telegram, recounting his son's request.
Autographed balls from the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals were
sent to the lad; Ruth wrote on one ball, ``I'll hit a home run for
you in Wednesday's game.''
   The Sultan of Swat then hit three homers in the Yankees' 10-5
fourth game victory over the Cardinals. Johnny's doctors reported
the boy had bounced back remarkably from his illness, and a legend
was born. Sylvester quickly became America's most famous invalid.
   ``That and the called home run _ those two specific incidents
are probably the best known Ruth stories,'' said Robert Creamer,
author of the biography ``Babe.''
   ``The incident is sort of characteristic of Ruth. He had a great
sort of ingenious quality about him,'' said Creamer. ``He'd do
things like this, sometimes with great publicity, sometimes with no
publicity.''
   When William Bendix portrayed ``The Bambino'' on film, the story
had Ruth bedside with a dying boy when the home run was promised.
It was far from accurate, but as Creamer noted, ``That was a pretty
bad movie.''
   One week later, Ruth visited the lad. Johnny, well aware that
Ruth had been caught stealing for the final out in the Yankees
series loss, told the Babe, ``I'm sorry the Yanks lost.''
   Sylvester went on to attend Princeton University, serve in World
War II, and become president of packing machinery business. His
son, John Jr., said his dad remained a Yankees fan until the end.
Slyvester is also survived by a sister and a brother.
   The whole Johnny Sylvester story apparently had little effect on
the Babe. According to Creamer's biography, Ruth was sitting around
with a couple of baseball writers during spring training in 1927
when Sylvester's uncle approached the Babe and thanked him
profusely.
   ``How is Johnny?'' Ruth asked. The uncle assured the Babe that
Johnny was doing OK and walked away.
   Ruth, who was notoriously bad with names and referred to most
everyone as ``kid,'' turned to the reporters and asked, ``Now who
the hell is Johnny Sylvester?''

   John Dale ``Johnny'' Sylvester, who became
the most famous little sick boy in America after Babe Ruth promised
to smack a World Series homer for him _ and hit three _ has died 63
years later. He was 74.
   Sylvester died Monday at a Mineola hospital. No cause of death
was given.
   In 1926, Sylvester was suffering from a serious infection of the
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father, ``I
wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a homer before I die.''
   The family sent telegrams to the New York Yankees while they
were playing in St. Louis. Back came an airmail package containing
two baseballs, one autographed by the St. Louis Cardinals, the
other signed by several Yankees, including Ruth, who wrote, ``I'll
knock a homer for you on Wednesday.''
   Ruth hit three that day. In a follow-up note the day of Game 6,
Ruth said he would ``try to knock you another homer, maybe two
today,'' but went homerless. He hit one in Game 7 but it was not
enough to prevent the Yankees from losing the Series. In fact, Ruth
was caught stealing for the final out.
   Ruth visited the Essex Fells, N.J., boy at his bedside after the
Series, a meeting at which Sylvester remarked, ``I'm sorry the
Yanks lost.''
   No miraculous recovery occurred, but the visit certainly did no
harm. It took Sylvester three years before he fully recovered.
Sylvester returned the gesture in 1948, visiting Ruth four months
before the slugger died of cancer.
   The 1926 episode later was part of the movie ``The Babe Ruth
Story,'' but the screen version stretched the truth by having Ruth
make his home run promise at Sylvester's hospital bedside. The boy
apparently was never hospitalized.
   Earlier, in the 1942 movie ``The Pride of the Yankees,''
Hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two
home runs by Lou Gehrig.
   Sylvester served in the Navy in World War II and was later
president of Amscomatic Inc., a manufacturer of packing machinery.
   He is survived by his son, John Jr., a sister, Ruth Elliott of
Barrington R.I., and a brother, Horace C. Sylvester Jr., of
Osterville, Mass.

<LEADPARA>  IF JOHN Goodman of "Roseanne" hadn't backed out of a deal to play baseball
immortal Babe Ruth in a new TV movie, Stephen Lang might still be toiling in
the minors.;   But Goodman did back out -- to make more money playing Ruth in
"The Babe," a movie coming to theaters early next year -- and Lang was called
in to take his place.  </LEADPARA>

PINCH HITTER MAKES LEGEND COME TO LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; BABE RUTH; Tonight at 9 on; See also related article on page 7 of

<TEXT>     The happy result is a big-league performance from the Broadway-trained Lang
in NBC's "Babe Ruth," a stirring bio-film that premieres tonight at 9 as a
major event of baseball's World Series month.;   Lang's Ruth is an incredibly
vain, headstrong hell-raiser who set as many records in the bedroom and at the
table as he did at the ballpark. Far from the bear-like buffoon William Bendix
played in the sanitized 1948 film "The Babe Ruth Story," Lang's Ruth is a
hot-tempered giant who could look the commissioner of baseball in the eye and
call him a "white-haired old bastard," regardless of the fine and suspension
that guaranteed. He's a man who wanted it all, no matter who got hurt in the
process.;   Yet the new "Babe Ruth" isn't just a myth-busting movie that
rewrites the legend. Lang's Ruth also takes us behind the bluster to see the
vulnerable man whose parents dumped him in a Catholic industrial school for
boys at an early age, then forgot about him.;   "I was too big and ugly for
anybody to come and see," the adult Ruth tells a lonely boy when he returns to
the school many years later.;   More than anything, though, the new "Babe
Ruth" presents a formidable challenge to an actor. Lang not only had to beef
up for the role (gaining 35 pounds) and master Ruth's unorthodox batting
stance and unique base-trotting style, but also had to make a frequently
unpleasant man likable enough to command our attention for two hours.;   Lang
has the tools to meet such a challenge. Schooled at the famed Actors' Studio
and various regional theater companies, he appeared on Broadway with Dustin
Hoffman in "Death of A Salesman" and earned a Tony nomination last season for
"The Speed of Darkness." His films include "Last Exit to Brooklyn" and
"Manhunter." In TV, he's best known for roles in "Crime Story" and the TV
version of Hoffman's "Salesman." Lang is known as an actor who gets deeply
involved with the characters he plays. He approached the role by locating what
he felt was the central metaphor for Ruth's life, which he found in a quote
from Ruth.;   "He said, 'I swing big; I hit big or I miss big; and that's the
way I live my life -- as big as I can,' " Lang explained.;   Lang decided he'd
take a "big bite" of the role and play it the way the real Ruth played ball.
But first the right-handed Lang had to get Ruth's left-handed swing down pat.;
  The producers arranged for him to work with another baseball star -- Hall of
Famer Rod Carew, who retired in 1986 with a lifetime batting average of .328
and seven American League batting titles. After daily batting practice at
Carew's Southern California baseball school, Lang compared videotapes of
himself with films of Ruth until he could match them perfectly.;   "When the
hitting began to fall into place," said Lang, "then playing the role began to
fall into place.";   (Carew claims Ruth had "terrible mechanics" as a hitter
and must have been incredibly strong to hit the ball as hard as he did from
his stance.);   The movie skips over Ruth's days as a pitcher for the Boston
Red Sox and begins in 1920, when the Babe was acquired by the New York
Yankees, primarily as a power hitter. In those days, the 6-foot-2 Ruth weighed
about 215 and was in trim shape. In the twilight of his career in the early
1930s, Ruth was much heavier, with a waistline of about 43 inches. Lang didn't
have time to gain that much weight, so makeup specialist Michael Westmore
fitted him with body padding and some special appliances to make his face and
neck appear fuller.;   For Lang, a lifelong baseball fan who grew up in New
York, the chance to play Ruth was the proverbial dream come true. Lang lives
just three miles from the site in Valhalla, N.Y., where Ruth is buried and has
regarded him as a hero since his earliest childhood.;   "The deeper I got into
him, the closer I felt to him," said Lang. "He was an extremely complex figure
-- and a very vulnerable figure with tremendous needs.";   In Lang's mind,
Ruth altered baseball forever by changing it from "little ball," with the
emphasis on singles, doubles and sacrifices, to "big ball," where the crowd
came to see home run sluggers.;   In his last year with the Red Sox before
joining the Yankees, Ruth hit 29 homers, a then overwhelming feat that Lang
believes made baseball fans "long-ball hungry" for good. In 1927, Ruth hit 60
home runs, more than any other team in the American League. He ended his
career with 714 homers (not counting his 15 in World Series competition), a
record surpassed only by Hank Aaron, who broke Ruth's record 39 years later,
taking many more times at bat to do it.;   "People would rather see Ruth
strike out than see a lot of other fine players hit a single or double," said
Lang.;   Lang's next acting assignment also is an extremely challenging one:
He'll play Hamlet on Broadway in February. But he's aware his portrayal of
Ruth may be a career-making one that people won't soon forget.;   "Maybe I'll
get a role as good as Babe," he said, "but I don't think I'll ever get one
better." (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Medal Of Freedom Proposed For Babe Ruth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker wants Hall of Famer
Babe Ruth to be honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
nearly 40 years after the baseball slugger's death.
   Ruth was a ``true American hero'' who ``epitomized the very best
of our national pastime,'' Weicker, R-Conn., said Thursday.
   The medal, the nation's highest civilian award, is given by the
president for contributions to national security, world peace or
``significant private or public endeavors.'' Seventy-one Medals of
Freedom have been awarded by President Reagan.
   Weicker, in a letter to Reagan nominating Ruth for the award,
noted the athlete's off-the-field contributions.
   ``He had great compassion for the sick and dying,'' the senator
said. ``Against the advice of many, Babe Ruth visited those
afflicted with Hansen's Disease in Kalappapa, Hawaii, and offered
those condemned to the `leper' colony his love and kindness.''
   Well known for his visits to sick children, Ruth also
established the Babe Ruth Foundation for underprivileged children
shortly before his death and left it a large part of his estate.
   Born in 1895 in Baltimore, George Herman Ruth hit 714 home runs
in 22 major league seasons with the Boston Red Sox, New York
Yankees and Boston Braves.
   A star pitcher early in his career, Ruth's career home run total
stood as the major league record until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974.
   Ruth died Aug. 16, 1948, at the age of 53.
   Other baseball players who have received the award include
former Yankee great Joe DiMaggio and the late Jackie Robinson, who
became the first black in the major leagues in the modern era when
he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

REMEMBERING MICKEY; 
</P>
<P>
MANTLE'S HOME RUNS TRANSCEND TIME, SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY POVICH, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was at this point in spring training, 20 years ago, that he stood before the 
microphones set up I in the Yankees' hotel suite and said: "I can't hit the 
ball anymore, and I can't steal second when I need to anymore, and I can't go 
from first to third anymore . . . and I think it's time to quit trying." 
</P>
<P>
He also might have said, and he wouldn't be lying, that no more would he be 
hitting the league's most and longest homers, or winning any more MVP awards of 
which there were three, and he wouldn't be scoring the most runs anymore, or 
driving in the most, and no more would he be the best drag bunter in baseball. 
Things like that. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was Mickey Mantle, saying goodby to the game that made him 
famous, and vice versa. He was telling the Yankees' management and the rest of 
the world that, at 37, he was packing it in, surrendering at last to the enemy 
of all his baseball years, his sorely abused, crybaby knees. 
</P>
<P>
They had plagued him since his rookie year with the Yankees when, in the second 
game of the 1951 World Series, he stepped into a drainage hole, twisted a knee, 
and was carried from the field on a stretcher, never to return to that series. 
</P>
<P>
He would later hit more World Series home runs, 18, than any man of his time, 
or before, or since. This was the Mickey Mantle who was now saying he couldn't 
play the game anymore. A giant was leaving the baseball scene. 
</P>
<P>
Always there were discussions about who hit the longest homers, usually with 
the agreement that Babe Ruth was No. 1. It was Walter Johnson who once put 
Ruth's homers in perspective when he was asked to compare Ruth and Jimmie Foxx 
and Hank Greenberg. Whose hits were the longest? Said Johnson: "All I can say 
is that the balls Ruth hit out of the park got smaller quicker than anybody 
else's." 
</P>
<P>
So where did Mantle fit in? In all his years Ruth never hit one over the high, 
concrete bleachers in left center field in Griffith Stadium in Washington. But 
of course he hit left-handed. Greenberg and Foxx had their shots at it, and it 
never happened. But one April afternoon in 1955, against the Senators' Chuck 
Stobbs, Mickey Mantle made it happen. By yards and yards his swat cleared those 
bleachers and sailed into Fifth Street beyond. After a measuring they came up 
with the opinion it was a masterly 565-foot production. 
</P>
<P>
The late Clark Griffith, owner of the Senators, put the Mantle homer in 
perspective when it was suggested to him that a prevailing wind helped the 
shot. "Consarn it, I don't care about that," Griffith said. "That same wind has 
been blowing for 100 years, and nobody else ever hit one out of there." 
</P>
<P>
When Mantle quit he didn't say that another Yankee dynasty had ended, because 
he didn't talk in those terms, but he could have. His had been the latest of 
the Yankee eras, in which one majestic performer had carried the team. First, 
it was the Babe Ruth era, then the longtime Joe DiMaggio phase of the Yankees. 
To whom would the torch be passed? Who could qualify for the greatness of the 
role? He would answer to the name of Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to the Yankees as the shy kid from the Oklahoma sandlots, with a 
blond cowlick, and offering his uncommon combination of muscle plus speed. He 
had also licked, he thought, a boyhood bout with the bone disease, 
osteomyelitis. In high school he had played football, too, and in later years a 
teammate who had remembered him then said of Mantle's speed, "Despite his good 
weight, he was lightfooted. It seemed he ran on top of the grass." 
</P>
<P>
Four times he led the AL in homers, but ironically he didn't in his most 
productive year when he slammed 54. That was when teammate Roger Maris hit 
those 61 to break Ruth's record. Some folks tried to make a thing of rivalry 
between Mantle and Maris that season, but Mickey was having none of it. "Roger 
is my friend," he said. "If I don't hit 61, I hope he does." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't need a home run to establish him as the home run giant of his times. 
Remembered is the 1956 World Series against Brooklyn, when a total of 16 homers 
were hit by all the players. Three were by Mantle. Those three were the longest 
three of the Series. 
</P>
<P>
He was the rarest combination of home run slugger and deft bunter who ever hit 
the big leagues. His specialty was the drag bunt, a thing of beauty in itself 
and now threatening to become a lost art. He could manage it with his hands and 
speed, when, as a switch hitter he chose to bat left-handed. From manager Casey 
Stengel, he had a blank check to drag one whenever he liked. On a two-strike 
count even. It would be risky, if not damn foolishness, for anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Mickey arrived in the Yankees' camp as a hitting instructor, 
met an old friend, and inquired about his golf game. In turn, Mantle, now a 
golf fanatic, was asked about his own game. "I'm hitting the ball well but I 
can't score," he said. What was wrong? "It's my putting," Mantle said. 
</P>
<P>
In a bases-loaded, two-strike situation in the ninth with the 60,000 in the 
park on the edge of their seats in high excitement, Mantle always seemed the 
calmest fellow in the place with the bat on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Mickey, what's wrong with your putting?" he was asked. "Hell," Mickey 
said, "I'm gutless." In addition to making a commentary on golf, he seemed to 
be saying baseball was his game.

JIM MURRAY: MARK HIS WORDS, 60 HOME RUNS STILL POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of major league baseball, only 10 men have hit 50 or more 
homers in a season. Only two have hit 60 or more. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 28 years since anyone hit 50 in the American League. That would be 
Roger Maris, who hit 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
When he did that, the then-commissioner of baseball, quaking in his concern for 
the memory of Babe Ruth, put an asterisk next to the achievement in the record 
book, noting that it was done in a season eight games longer than the ones Ruth 
played in. The commissioner was afraid, apparently, that the 60-homer season 
would become commonplace with expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Frick needn't have worried. Not only has no one hit 60 in that league 
since, no one has even hit 50. 
</P>
<P>
Will anyone ever hit 60 again? Will anyone even hit 50? 
</P>
<P>
I took the problem to one of the young men I consider to be a prime threat to, 
one day, get an asterisk after his name -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire is a hitter for the Oakland Athletics, who looks as if he had just 
walked off a Saturday Evening Post cover -- sandy hair, blue eyes, just a hint 
of freckles. He's as strong as truck-stop coffee and as uncomplicated as a 
summer day, the All-American type who seemingly can deal with the everyday 
pressures of big league baseball as nonchalantly as the Babe himself. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit more home runs, 49, in his first year than any other rookie who 
ever played and might have hit 50 if he hadn't shortened the season to go home 
for the birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
Very few people have hit 100 home runs as quickly in their big league careers 
as McGwire. His teammate, Jose Canseco, is one. Tony Conigliaro of the Boston 
Red Sox was another. 
</P>
<P>
So I thought Mark might be a good man to ask what it might take to hit 60 home 
runs now. Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants is 18 homers ahead of him 
this year -- but Mark is 14 ahead of Mitchell lifetime. And four years younger. 
</P>
<P>
Are 60 homers in a season even possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"I know guys who can do it," he said. "Freddy McGriff of Toronto, Jose 
(Canseco), Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
What about Mark McGwire? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire sighed. "Well, it would depend on a number of factors." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's see. It'd go about like this: 
</P>
<P>
"1. The media. You have to take into account what the media would do today as 
you got closer. I don't think those old-time ballplayers like Ruth and Maris 
had that to contend with. (Oh, yes, Maris did!) 
</P>
<P>
"Today, you would have Channels 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and '60 Minutes' and every 
magazine and newspaper in the country on your doorstep, in your locker, in the 
shower. To hit 60 home runs, you'd need to concentrate solely on your game and 
these distractions wouldn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"2. Jose Canseco. You need the other dangerous hitter in the lineup behind you 
or ahead of you. Ruth had (Lou) Gehrig. Henry Aaron had Eddie Mathews. Maris 
had Mickey Mantle. (Willie) Mays had (Willie) McCovey. Frank Robinson had 
Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I would need Jose Canseco. Or vice versa. You need that other hitter so the 
pitchers can't pitch around you, so that you get pitches to hit. You can't get 
60 home runs swinging at ball four all season." 
</P>
<P>
"3. Adjustment. You're not going to get the same pitches all year long. What 
you hit home runs off the first half of the season, you're not going to get the 
last half. Pitchers will make you hit something else. They're not going to 
throw you what you've shown you can hit. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to adjust to a new location or a new speed. That's why a lot of guys 
have a flock of home runs by the All-Star break but tail off after that. You 
don't get 60 homers in a half a season." 
</P>
<P>
"4. Health. You have to stay healthy and injury-free. You have to be able to 
fight off fatigue. September might be the most important month. (Ruth hit 17 
home runs in September of the season he hit 60.) And if you're mentally 
fatigued, your timing is all off. 
</P>
<P>
"5. Pull. I don't mean influence, I mean pulling the ball. I get most of my 
home runs to left-center or center. To hit 60, you have to pull the ball a lot, 
get your share of foul-line home runs. I don't think it's possible to hit 60 
420-foot home runs. Too many things have to go just right. 
</P>
<P>
"6. Patience. I never, or almost never, hit a home run while I'm trying to. I 
didn't even know I was a home run hitter when I was coming up. I just tried to 
hit the ball fair some place. That's when you get home runs. I led the nation 
(with 32 home runs) when I was in college (at USC). Then I hit 24 home runs at 
Modesto. But a home run happens. You don't forceit." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a generation now since anyone even hit 50 in the American League. Lou 
Gehrig never hit 50. Neither did the all-time homer champion, Henry Aaron. 
Neither did Roger Maris, except for his record year. 
</P>
<P>
The only batters who hit 60 were left-handed, but all but three of the nine who 
hit 50 were strictly right-handed -- Ralph Kiner, Mays, Hack Wilson, Hank 
Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, George Foster. Mantle was a switch-hitter, Johnny Mize 
and Ruth were lefties. 
</P>
<P>
Are even 50 possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire laughed. "Well, I would need some great September!" He has 21 to date. 
</P>
<P>
Does he aim for 600 lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire shook his head. "What my goal is has nothing to do with that. I want to 
win a WorldSeries." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's one way to look at that: Every guy who has ever hit 60 home runs 
has led his team to a World Series victory. Look it up.

JIM MURRAY: OLD-TIMER STRIKES BACK AT COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1930, something like 57 National League batters batted over .300. One of 
them batted .401. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, only four National League batters hit over .300. The league champion 
hit .313. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, every member of the champion St. Louis Cardinals starting lineup 
batted over .300. Last year, most teams didn't have any batters over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The late Fresco Thompson used to recall ruefully the year he hit .324 for the 
Philadelphia Phillies -- and batted eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, the year Bill Terry batted .401, the second-place hitter, Babe Herman, 
batted .393. The third-place hitter, Chuck Klein, batted .386, fourth was Lefty 
O'Doul at .383 and fifth was Fred Lindstrom at .379. Terry got 254 hits, Klein, 
250 and Herman, 241. 
</P>
<P>
The most hits in the National League last year was Andre Galarraga's 184. 
</P>
<P>
Hack Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs in 1930. The league leader 
last year was Will Clark of San Francisco with 109. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Were there giants in those days, runts in this? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball scholars have been uneasy with these figures, this discrepancy, for 
years. It is not possible for them to conclude that the batters of a 
half-century ago were that much better than those of today. There must be an 
illogical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Their "explanation" makes Bill Starr see red. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Starr is not a nostalgia buff. Bill Starr is not one of those 
Ty-Cobb-was-better-than-Pete-Rose guys. Bill Starr was an owner of the San 
Diego Padres in the '40s and '50s before the major leagues came to California. 
He was a player in the '30s, briefly a catcher for the old Washington Senators 
(now the Minnesota Twins). 
</P>
<P>
Starr's outrage is not directed at those who would say that today's players are 
as good as yesterday's. He concedes that. What brings him off the wall is the 
notion promoted by those who would hold that yesterday's players were no good 
-- and that they can prove it with computers. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the pitchers couldn't get them out. But the computers blow them 
away. Starr has written a book titled "Clearing The Bases -- Baseball Then And 
Now," and he points to the following paragraph taken from another book ("The 
Hidden Game Of Baseball") as an example of rewriting history by floppy disk. 
"If Ty Cobb's career had taken place . . . in 1976," those authors have 
written, "his lifetime B.A. (which was actually .367) would have been only 
.289. Rogers Hornsby (lifetime .358) and Joe DiMaggio (lifetime .325) would 
have achieved identical .280 marks. Bill Terry, Lou Gehrig and Tris Speaker 
would be average to mediocre hitters at .271, .269 and .265, respectively. The 
Babe's (Ruth's) .262 (Babe actually hit .342) would be a disappointment, though 
better than Al Simmons' .260 (Al hit .334 with the bat but not the bytes) or 
Honus Wagner's .251 (Honus had better luck in person, too, .329)." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that 1930 was a bumper year for base hits (the National League 
batted .303 for that year while last year's average was .248), Starr blames the 
decline in hitting on a number of observable (not computerized) phenomenas, 
most notably the strikeout. It's become endemic in the big leagues. Big 
leaguers struck out 25,098 times in 1987, compared to a two-league average of 
only 7,517 in the '20s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern ballplayer seems to have no knowledge of the strike zone," Starr 
laments. "Babe Ruth had a big reputation as a striker-outer, but he struck out 
only 79 times a year on the average. DiMaggio struck out only 27, Ted Williams 
only 46. Gehrig struck out only 49, even homer sluggers such as Mel Ott struck 
out only 48 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson averaged 129 a year and put the strikeout record 600 above 
everyone else. He struck out 171 times one year. Wilver Stargell struck out 122 
times a year. Mickey Mantle struck out an average of 105 times a year, and Mike 
Schmidt strikes out 117. Babe Ruth isn't even in the top 25 in lifetime 
strikeouts anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Starr disputes the notion a strikeout is "a nice clean out." It doesn't result 
in a double play or worse, it's not as humiliating as a popup. But, says Starr, 
"It kills a rally. It raises the morale of the pitcher. Nothing is more 
counter-productive to the winning of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Starr points out that "in 1987, there were 41 players who struck out more than 
100 times. By comparison, in the entire 20 years from 1920 through 1939, 100 or 
more strikeouts occurred only 10 times." He points out that Cobb only struck 
out 24 times the year he hit .401 and that George Sisler struck out only 14 
times the year he hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth never struck out 100 times. Reggie Jackson had 100 or more strikeouts 
18 times in his career. "That's why he only batted .263," Starr explains. 
Mantle fanned more than 100 times eight seasons and more than 90 in four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Starr takes issue with the notion a lively ball produced the orgy of base hits 
in 1930. Starr argues that the goal of baseball was never to "juice up" a 
baseball, only to make it more uniform. He says, on the contrary, that after 
1930, the National League changed the cork center of the ball and raised the 
seams, which resulted in a dramatic drop in that league's offense (Hack Wilson 
went from 56 homers to 13 and from 190 RBIs to 61 but bathtub gin may have had 
as much to do with it as baseballs). And it turned the National League into a 
curveball league that really wasn't competitive with the power-hitting American 
League for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Starr thinks, in addition to not knowing the strike zone, players are not 
seasoned in the minor leagues the way they used to be -- and should be. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Bill Starr takes on the computer rewriters of history on a 
You-had-to-be-there basis. He points out, for example, that Pythagorean 
principles don't apply to psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson was a comparable example. His batting statistics were not 
overwhelming, and he hardly rated among the most outstanding defensive players 
in baseball history. But he, like Cobb, was an intimidator on the basepaths. He 
put pressure on the opposition, he compelled defensive changes in their play. 
Infielders were made to move closer to their bags, thus producing larger holes 
in the infield. To prevent Robinson from stealing, pitchers were compelled to 
alter their natural deliveries and selection of pitches. All of this favored 
the hitters on his club." Computers cannot pick this up, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
Bill proves his point convincingly. But, you don't really need a book when 
someone comes up to you with a whole bunch of printouts to tell you Babe Ruth 
would only hit .262 and Honus Wagner, .251. All you really have to do is say, 
"Gid oudda here!"

<TEXT>
   Babe Ruth wasn't just a legendary home run
hitter for the New York Yankees _ he's a registered federal
trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against
MacMillan Publishing.
   The suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court by Dorothy Ruth
Pirone of Durham, Conn., and Julia Ruth Stevens of Conway, N.H.,
seeks to halt sales of a 1988 calendar published by MacMillan that
carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover.
   ``MacMillan's unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of
Babe Ruth's image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and
deceive the public,'' said attorney Martin A. Levitin, representing
the Ruth family, in court papers.
   ``The 1988 MacMillan Baseball Engagement Calendar'' includes two
photos of the Babe that were used without permission of the family,
the suit charged.
   The suit, which also lists Babe Ruth League Inc. and the Curtis
Management Group Inc. as plaintiffs, said Ruth's daughters filed a
written request with MacMillan asking it to halt distribution of
the calendar. The publisher allegedly ignored the request.
   Ruth's daughters received a federal trademark last year for the
name ``Babe Ruth'' on paper articles, the suit said. Curtis handles
licensing of third parties seeking to use Ruth's name, it said.
   Sharon Dynak, a spokesman for MacMillan, said she had not yet
seen the suit and had no immediate comment on the suit, which
charges MacMillan with trademark infringement and unfair
competition.
   The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval for a
permanent injunction blocking MacMillan from using additional
photos of Ruth; an award to the plaintiffs of all profits made from
calendar sales; additional monetary damages; and reimbursement for
all lawyers' fees.

<LEADPARA>  PERHAPS because of baseball's longevity, or maybe because of its association
with childhood summers, the sport thrives on nostalgia. It's a game many of us
can regard with soul-warming affection, even if we didn't play it well. By
definition, then, a videocassette called "Baseball's Greatest Moments" (60
minutes, $19.95) is destined to find a receptive audience.;    The tape also
happens to be a production of Major League Baseball Home Video, giving it that
"official" cachet. The viewer can rest assured the best available game footage
was used.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     New York focus;    The tape limits itself to 20 "greatest moments," which
fill an hour nicely but also will spark disappointment among partisans who
have their own ideas of greatness. The relative merits of specific plays can
be argued endlessly by fans (and in fact they are, to the game's enrichment),
so your own favorite may have to wait for an enlightened sequel.;    For the
time being, however, it's fair to say that fans of the Yankees, Dodgers and
Giants will find themselves particularly well-served. Among the players
extolled here are Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Willie
Mays, Bobby Thomson, Don Larsen, Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson. The rest of
the country may wonder why MLB Home Video didn't call the tape "New York
Baseball's Greatest Moments.";    Starting with Babe Ruth's "called shot"
homer in 1932 and ending with Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter just last year,
each historic moment is preceded by a title screen describing the event and
date. The titles are set inside of picture frames, and signature scenes from
each event are glorified with special video treatment that renders
painting-like images.;    The narration supplies the context leading up to the
crucial action -- Mays' over-the-shoulder catch in 1954, Larsen's perfect game
in the 1956 World Series, Maris' 61st home run, Pete Rose's 4,192th career hit
and so on.;    Looking back;    Where possible, each is followed by the
comments of players or managers as they are today, looking back at the moment.
These scenes can be powerfully moving, such as Maris' recollection of feeling
embarrassed about stepping out of the dugout to take a bow after he broke
Ruth's home-run record, or Harvey Haddix still smiling at the fates who took a
game away from him even after he had pitched 12 perfect innings.;    "Greatest
Moments" is not limited to actual hits, runs and errors. Also shown are
Gehrig's farewell speech in 1939 (coupled with DiMaggio's reflection on that
day) as well as the arrival of Robinson in the major leagues. Leo Durocher
recalls the very unwelcoming attitude of his Dodgers and his own words of
advice: "You'd better get used to it, boys."  </TEXT>

BABE RUTH: DEAD 41 YEARS, HE LIVES ON IN ENDORSEMENTS THAT BRING HEIRS HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SANDOMIR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the potential Babe Ruth would have in today's 
every-athlete-has-a-sneaker-deal endorsement market. 
</P>
<P>
He could rival Bo Jackson -- "Babe knows baseball. . . . Babe knows hot dogs" 
-- hawk Hertz with Arnie and O. J., look lumpy in his Hanes with Boomer 
Esiason, pitch Slimfast diets with Lasorda and take sides in the Miller Lite 
"Less filling! Tastes Great!" debate. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Ruth is not doing shabbily. Forty-one years after his death, Ruth's 
name and visage are licensed to more than 100 companies and products -- banks, 
car companies, retailers, trading card firms, teddy bears, and a maker of 
trapping knives -- avidly trying to profit from his powerful, mythic and 
mischievous appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bambino is earning wealth for his heirs that, given his own commercial 
bent, surely wouldn't have surprised the man who did not break stride when told 
his $80,000 salary exceeded President Hoover's. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which celebrity worship is at its height, stars such as the Babe 
cannot commit the ultimate no-no of endorsement deals: getting in trouble. 
Though the Babe was known to imbibe, smoke and carouse, his conduct is now 
impeccable. Through the selective filter of hero worship, the Babe's image is 
as clean as Orel Hershiser's. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that trend the expanding market for baseball memorabilia, and it's easy 
to see why the most popular player in the sport's history remains its most 
durable commercial symbol. 
</P>
<P>
So, whether he endorses IBM personal computers, sneakers, free checking for 
senior citizens at a Philadelphia bank, Zenith power supplies or the 
Hewlett-Packard sales force, Babe Ruth stands for whatever the paying company 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of Babe Ruth is a very tangible thing," said Mark Roesler, 
president of Curtis Management Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing 
agent. "Babe's image as the ultimate power hitter, the ultimate superstar isn't 
going to change. (Roger) Maris hit 61 homers, but the Babe's image will never 
change. He's achieved his place in history. Current players have not." 
</P>
<P>
Roesler said that fees paid to the Ruth family, including his surviving 
daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, and his two daughters' children, and Babe Ruth 
Baseball Inc., were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and are expected to grow to 
at least $1 million in 1990. Roesler said that before Curtis took control of 
the Ruth marketing from Babe Ruth Baseball in 1984, annual fees amounted to 
less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
How would the Babe do if he returned in the pot-bellied flesh? 
</P>
<P>
Not badly, but he'd have more competition in a more active market. And he would 
risk being a disaster to those who would hire him as their spokesman if his 
personal excesses were as probed and criticized as those of today's stars. 
</P>
<P>
But if he controlled himself, he might outdo everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Said Daisy Sinclair, casting director for the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising 
agency: "I can't think of a category around that he wouldn't fit into, except 
Weight Watchers. He could do ads for vitamins because looking at him, you 
wonder how he could do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
When Ruth was the highest-paid player in baseball, the endorsement game was 
small. He got around more than any other star, endorsing a hat, a brand of 
cigar -- he puffed on them in the showroom window of the factory -- chewing 
tobacco, long johns, shoes, a watch and autographed balls given away by Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
He also backed the short-lived Babe Ruth's Home Run Candy, which lost a legal 
fight with the makers of the Baby Ruth candy bar -- named not for the Babe, but 
for Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth -- and a Manhattan haberdashery, Babe 
Ruth's for Men, that shut its doors in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercialization was so much less then," said Robert Creamer, author of 
"Babe: The Legend Comes to Life," the definitive 1974 biography of Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it strikes me as something weird that a man dead 40 years can be a live 
property. But it's obvious that he's a recognizable personality and a 
plus-person -- that is, someone you'd like to see here now." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of marketers evidently think the Babe is worth the price of seeing him, 
if not in person, in two dimensions. You want the Babe for a one-time ad in a 
newspaper? That will be $500. You want to put the Babe in a national print 
campaign? Pay $15,000, please. Now you want the Babe in a national multi-media 
campaign? Well, that will be $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
What do marketers want from Babe Ruth? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Power: For a Sears Business Centers campaign, the retailer paid about 
$10,000 to feature Ruth in its "heavy hitters" advertising series to sell 
several makes of personal computers. The ads -- with retouched photos of the 
Babe holding or using PCs -- noted that the products were "marked down to 
prices in your ballpark. All heavy hitters . . . Not bad, huh, Babe?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- History: For the marketers at United Valley Bank in Philadelphia, Ruth's 
image, teamed with that of teammate Lou Gehrig, provided a touchstone for its 
target group: depositors 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're old enough to remember them, you can forget about paying for 
checking," said the slogan, above a posed shot of Ruth and Gehrig before the 
Yankee Stadium backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inspiration: The Carlson Marketing Group's motivation division used Ruth's 
image and his words -- "Baseball is a great teacher" -- on a poster to gussy up 
a baseball-oriented incentive program designed for computer sales forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dependability: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. featured a photo of Ruth's 
"called shot" in the 1932 World Series against Chicago Cub pitcher Charlie Root 
to illustrate reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"A promise made, a promise kept," read the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Chattanooga cutlery maker Jim Frost produces a series of commemorative trapping 
knives named for Ruth, Gehrig and Ty Cobb. They are encased in walnut music 
boxes that play "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frost: "This is the era of name recognition, and we've gone this route to 
promote our merchandise. On the Ruth knife, we have an etching of him on the 
blade and an authorization slip that tells some of his history. We limit 
production to 3,000 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Management Group has carved a specialty out of marketing celebrities. 
Besides Ruth, Gehrig and Cobb, Curtis' sports clientele -- featuring 27 Hall of 
Famers -- includes Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Casey Stengel, Bob Feller, 
Vince Lombardi, Jim Thorpe and Jesse Owens. Its entertainment- and 
historical-figure roster features James Dean, Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart, 
Mark Twain and Amelia Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a baseball legend wanted by marketers is out of Curtis' realm. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Stevens, merchandising director of the Baseball Hall of Fame: "If 
something we're doing is beyond the scope of the agreement the Hall of Famers 
have directly with the Hall for products we sell in our gift shop or through 
our catalogue, we go to Curtis. In fact, we're doing a series of 1991 calendars 
that use only Curtis clients." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has been especially active in the last year, increasing its stable of 
baseball clients to about 30 former players. 
</P>
<P>
The year just past was the biggest yet for Lou Gehrig licensing, because of the 
50th anniversary of his emotional retirement from baseball and Major League 
Baseball's dedication of the season to the ALS Foundation, which raises funds 
to research a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven companies are "Iron Horse" licensees, many for products tied to 
the U.S. Postal Service's issue of a Gehrig stamp last June. 
</P>
<P>
Some estates restrict what the legends can sell. 
</P>
<P>
In Ruth's case, his daughters have barred liquor and tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
In Gehrig's case, said Roesler: "We respect Eleanor Gehrig's wish not to use 
Lou Gehrig for fund-raising purposes. He's not licensed for any ALS research 
group except the one at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (the Eleanor and 
Lou Gehrig ALS Center), though we allowed the ALS Foundation to do a few 
specific things this year." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Gehrig left her estate and the rights to market her husband to the 
medical center, which derived a six-figure licensing income this year. 
</P>
<P>
Properties such as Ruth and Gehrig, valuable in life and death, are protected. 
Curtis has 18 infringement suits pending, including a protracted action against 
Macmillan Publishing Co. over an engagement calendar that Curtis alleges 
illegally used a photograph of Ruth; and two against card collector firms for 
alleged unauthorized use of the images of 10 of its players on card sets. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity representatives are gaining more protection because of new state laws 
that grant the dead stars' exclusive licensing rights to their heirs for a 
specified number of years. For example, California's 1985 law grants the heirs 
licensing rights for 50 years after a celebrity's death; Oklahoma's term is 100 
years, Nevada's 50 and Tennessee's 10.

Even when the 50-year bell tolls on Babe Ruth in 1998, there are other legal 
ways to protect his name and likeness. Curtis has secured trademark protection 
in categories such as paper goods, gifts, apparel and footwear that will 
protect the family's rights as long as their legacy's name and image stay in 
continual use. 
</P>
<P>
So as long as the Ruth legend remains a never-dying part of the magic and lore 
of baseball, it seems clear that marketers will turn to him when they want to 
ally their product or message with his ever-living mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at today's players: most have professional credibility, but not the 
extra spark of charisma," said Marty Blackman, who advises corporations on the 
use of personalities in commercials. "But when you look for a spokesman, you 
want professional credibility, which Ruth had with his hitting and home runs; 
and charisma, which he really had. He's one of those people who rose to the top 
and just stayed there."

The pitch was right where it had to be. Two more inches outside and it's Ball 
4. Six inches inside and Kirk Gibson fouls it off again. Pops it up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was a pitch that made the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise to the batter. Gibson knew it was coming all the way. He 
wasn't really muscled up to hit it out of the park, just out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were these: The World Series, it so happened, was on the 
line. Not everyone knew it at the time because it was only Game 1, but it was 
the ninth inning, and the Dodgers trailed, 4-3, with two out. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew history was in the making as Kirk Gibson limped up to the plate. No 
one knew a home run for the ages was about to be hit. Else, why did Mike Davis, 
who walked with two out, steal second base? I mean, would you steal second with 
Babe Ruth coming up? What if you get thrown out? There goes the World Series. 
There goes baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson came out of the Dodger dugout like a guy who had just got hit by a 
truck. He didn't walk, he hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
History is not made, it just happens. You have to wonder, what if Charlie Root 
had walked Babe Ruth the day he called his shot in the World Series in 1932? 
And what if Dennis Eckersley had bounced a 3-2 curve to Gibson in the World 
Series in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows if Babe Ruth knew what was coming that day in Chicago so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk Gibson knew exactly what was coming in Game 1 in 1988. Because in the 
pre-Series scouting session with the club, scout Mel Didier laid it on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure as I'm standing here breathing, if it's the ninth inning and the count is 
3-2, you're going to see a back-door slider from Dennis Eckersley," he warned. 
"Make book on it. Don't look for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
A back-door slider is a cross between a fastball and a curveball. It looks like 
a fastball till it swerves like a breaking ball. It's a home run pitch. It's a 
batting practice pitch -- if you know it's coming. Otherwise, it's called 
Strike 3. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it would have been in Gibson's case. The back-door nomenclature 
comes from the fact that the pitch is delivered to the outside of the plate to 
a left-handed batter. It looks all the way like Ball 4. Only Gibson knew that 
at the last fraction, the ball would dip over the plate and down into the 
strike zone. He put that pitch into the right-field seats -- and, no doubt, 
into Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few home runs make the Hall of Fame. Ruth's called shot in '32. Bobby 
Thomson's three-run "little miracle of Coogan's Bluff" in the ninth in 1951. 
Henry Aaron's 715th. 
</P>
<P>
And Kirk Gibson's in Dodger Stadium in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because that home run effectively won the World Series. It's not impossible to 
think that the Oakland Athletics suddenly began to look like a lot of guys 
trapped in a haunted house after that one swing. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, they had given all the appearances of being an almost 
overconfident bunch. They had just slammed down the dangerous Boston Red Sox in 
four straight. The Dodgers weren't even supposed to be in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco had done what he's supposed to do in the World Series -- hit a 
grand slam. The A's had the best relief pitcher in the universe on the mound. 
They had a guy at bat who looked as if he'd just left his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
And, all of a sudden, the ball is in the right-field seats. The game is over. 
Oakland is hearing voices. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's home run is one for the ages. But it wouldn't have been had Oakland 
come back to sweep the Series. It would have been just an interesting incident. 
Now, it becomes one of the great dramatic turning points of baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
It was a home run the minute it left the bat. The only suspense was how far up 
in the bleachers it would land. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson recalls that he wasn't able to put the real Gibson 360-degree home run 
swing on it. He didn't have to. If he had been able to, the ball might not have 
come down yet. As it was, it was no foul-line shot. It was a rainmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson never got another at-bat in the Series. He didn't need one. Gibson 
batted 1.000 for the '88 World Series. In fact, he batted a million. It's 
probably what that hit was worth to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson has now hit seven home runs in postseason play. If Reggie Jackson 
is Mr. October, Kirk Gibson is at least hey-what-about-me? 
</P>
<P>
He hit two home runs in one game in the 1984 World Series. The second one put 
that Series away. 
</P>
<P>
"There were men on second and third, first base was open and the expectation 
was that (San Diego Padres relief pitcher) Goose Gossage would walk me," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Manager) Sparky Anderson was holding up four fingers to me, 
indicating they were going to walk me. I shook my head. I knew Gossage would 
try to strike me out. I held up 10 fingers and shook them at Sparky, meaning I 
bet 10 dollars Gossage would pitch to me. Sparky said, 'You got a bet!' 
</P>
<P>
"(San Diego Manager) Dick Williams came out to the mound. I could almost hear 
Gossage mouthing to him, 'Hey! I've always had pretty good luck pitching to 
this guy. Let me get him out. I can strike him out.' 
</P>
<P>
"The first pitch was a ball. The second was what I knew it would be. A Gossage 
fastball up and in." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson hit it into the second deck. That World Series was over, too. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is, never throw Kirk Gibson a strike with a game, or a 
Series on the line. Particularly if he's expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, these are the little mistakes that make baseball what it is, 
endlessly fascinating to rehash, relive. The game that brought the hot stove 
league to sports. 
</P>
<P>
To err is not only human, it's baseball. Pitchers get E-1 if they throw wildly 
or to a wrong base. They should get one for throwing accurately to the plate 
with Gibson and a Series on the line. But of such foibles is the game made 
great. 
</P>
<P>
What if Charlie Root had hit Babe Ruth in the fat of the back instead of the 
fat of the bat? Suppose Ralph Branca had thrown Bobby Thomson a changeup? What 
if Dennis Eckersley had thrown a back-door Ball 4 that never broke over the 
plate, instead of a slider that did? 
</P>
<P>
If he had, the 500,000 or so people who say they saw Gibson's home run from the 
seats would admit they missed the game altogether. Instead of being a home run 
for Cooperstown, it would have been, if Oakland had gone on to win the Series, 
just another run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has the ball. He ought at least write, "Thanks, Mel!" on it for Didier. 
And for all baseball.

Baseball Stories: Martin, Maris and the Yanks
---
By Joe Mysak</HL>
<DD> 04/08/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Old-timers know that baseball today is not what it was even 30 years ago. 
Billy Martin, who has been building winning ball clubs (and then getting fired from them) over much of this period, tells why. 

   In "BillyBall" (Doubleday, 276 pages, $16.95), Mr. Martin, with the help of New York Daily News sport columnist Phil Pepe, relates what he's done since the publication of his autobiography, "Number 1," seven years ago. 
Along the way he writes about managers and managing, why infielders often make the best managers, sketches George Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson, tells how to put together a lineup, and discusses free agents, some old friends and, of course, the old days. 

   At age 60, he is not particularly old as far as managers go, but the game he played as second baseman for the New York Yankees during the 1950s had more in common with the game played by John McGraw at the turn of the century than it does with the one played today. 

   Today's player, in Mr. Martin's opinion, does not spend enough time in the minor leagues learning his trade. 
When he does make the big club, he rooms alone, and does not get the opportunity to talk baseball with a roomie. 
He feels little team loyalty. 
Long-term contracts sap his incentive to perform. 
And if he gets a powerful enough agent, he may be able to get his manager fired or otherwise dictate club policy. 

   Finally, there are the malcontents, who, despite fancy contracts, say they no longer want to play for their team because it is "not fun" anymore, which usually means that they don't like the skipper because he believes in platooning. 
Mr. Martin's advice: "I wish baseball would just release them. 
Nobody sign the SOBs. 
You don't want to play here? 
You don't like it here? 
Released. 
Go home. 
Go to work. 
You get no more salary, no more having your contract renegotiated, no more calling your agent or the Players' Association for every little thing." 

   The solution, he says, is more one-year contracts for marginal players whose value has been inflated, and a less competitive free-agent market. 
The owners, who can take great responsibility for starting the whole mess, seem to be coming around to these ideas, which is why several familiar faces were not in a uniform on opening day. 

   In contrast with this tale of the preposterous debasement of the national pastime is "Sixty-One" (Macmillan, 269 pages, $19.95), by Tony Kubek and Terry Pluto, a history of the sublime 1961 Yankees, "the most selfless team I've ever managed" in the words of Ralph Houk. 
It is a story of redemption, pursuit and triumph, built around one of the most magnificent feats in baseball. 

   The story belongs to Roger Maris and his pursuit of Babe Ruth's record 60 home runs in one season. 
Fans tend to root for records to be broken -- but in 1961, they wanted Mickey Mantle, Maris's teammate, to do it, and in 154 games, the same number of games it had taken Ruth, not the 162 games of the expanded schedule. 
Ford Frick, then commissioner of baseball, called attention to the difference between the two records, and rightly so. 
But it does not detract from its heroic quality. 
As Mantle says, "It was something. . . . 
All I know is that no one did it before or since, and I know how damn hard it is to do it, because I tried it and never made it." 

   At the time, however, Maris was subject to abuse from fans, tears from Ruth's widow, attacks from old-timers who contended Maris was unworthy because he was not as colorful as the Bambino and was not a .300 hitter, and from newspaper sportswriters who took joy in orchestrating the attack. 
Maris hit his 61, but paid the price, and from all accounts was not the same man afterward. 

   But the story goes beyond Mickey and Roger and ace pitcher Whitey Ford (who won 25 games and lost only four that season) and Babe Ruth's ghost. 
The fabric of consistent, winning teams is of a finer weave. 
This is a story of great and small, and Mr. Kubek, with the help of sportswriter Pluto, makes sure to tell the small. 
It is the story of a team that came back after the heartbreaking loss of the World Series in seven games in 1960 to win 109 games in 1961, and to win the series that year in five. 

   It is the story of Ralph Houk, who replaced the legendary Casey Stengel at the helm. 
And it is the story of, among others, the acrobatic third baseman Clete Boyer; utility man Johnny Blanchard, who hit 21 homers, many of them game-winners, in only 243 at bats; and Luis Arroyo, the chubby relief pitcher who went 15-5 with 29 saves and a 2.19 earned run average. 

   It is also the story of Mr. Kubek, who was the shortstop for that team and who is now a commentator for NBC's "Game of the Week." 
He tells his story, and his teammates' stories, usually in their own words. 
There are some pretty good ones.

<LEADPARA>  Item: Jose Canseco, after a 1990 game in which he hit a ball that had the
audacity not to reach the Oakland Coliseum's left-field bleachers, imparted
this wisdom to sportswriters: "Baseball's entertainment, and the fans like to
see home runs. They should move the fences in.";    Item: Mickey Mantle, in a
national radio interview this season, talked of his rookie year -- Joe
DiMaggio's last -- with the New York Yankees, 1951. "He was supposed to be
sort of washed up, I guess. . . . It just makes me wonder how good he must
have been before." Mantle, an expert witness and, like Canseco, one of the
most powerful hitters ever, discussed the plight of a right-handed hitter such
as DiMaggio playing half his games each season in cavernous Yankee Stadium,
before it was rebuilt and the dimensions were reduced in 1976. "I remember a
Sunday when he hit four balls at least 420 feet. They all got caught. He
probably has four home runs if he's playing somewhere else. Instead he goes 0
for 4."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary
Chart attached to the end of this article
Frank Cracolice, currently a Features department copy editor, is a former
Mercury News sportswriter who counted baseball assignments among his duties.
He also is a lifelong DiMaggio fan.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Mantle is quoted to inform any player who thinks he has it so bad --
Canseco, for example -- that among all the great hitters, no one had a more
unfavorable home park than DiMaggio.;    And make no mistake: DiMaggio was a
great hitter, and not just because of that 56-game hitting streak that has
been celebrated since he strung it together in 1941. Consider that while
hitting 361 home runs in his 13 seasons, DiMaggio struck out only 368 times.
Those numbers separate him from all other hitters -- confirming his ability to
make contact as so-called "singles hitters" do while powering the ball as only
sluggers do. The strikeout, a power hitter's prerogative, was almost
transcended by DiMaggio.;    Consider also: DiMaggio, who along with Ted
Williams will be an honorary American League co-captain at Tuesday's All-Star
Game, hit 30 or more home runs and struck out less than his home run totals in
seven separate seasons -- an unheard of pairing of precision and power. It is
considered excellent contact for a home run hitter if he can hold his
strikeouts to 2 1/2 times his home runs in a season. (Hank Aaron struck out
almost twice for each homer he hit, exceptional; Willie Mays struck out nearly
2 1/2 times per home run; and Mantle more than three times for each homer.);  
 A rare parlay;  Tommy Henrich, DiMaggio teammate and admirer, told author
David Halberstam in the latter's fine book, "Summer of '49," that the two
numbers, 361 and 368, still made him incredulous, all these years later.;   
Such a combination of contact and crunch is a rare parlay indeed. It's Ray
Robinson, choosing to box or slug as he saw fit; Jim Brown, running over or
around a defender; Sandy Koufax, striking out batters without having to pay
his way with walks. Choices of skills that only the greats possess.;    What
makes DiMaggio's power numbers so impressive is that he played at Yankee
Stadium with its dreaded left-center field, Death Valley. Only right down the
line could DiMaggio get away with the kind of home run that today elicits
high-fives and arm-bashes from teammates. From straightaway left to
right-center, DiMaggio's power zone, Yankee Stadium's fences were more than
400 feet away at most angles, with awesome distances of 457 and 461 feet to
left-center and dead (indeed) center field.;    So I get impatient with a
Canseco politicking for an easier home target in Oakland. Making Canseco's
pleas even harder to swallow is his penchant for striking out, in which case
it doesn't matter where the fences are.;    The game has changed;  There has
been much talk about whether today's stars could have played back when, but to
turn the proposition around, wouldn't DiMaggio and Williams like their chances
in today's game?;    Wouldn't they thrive on the various artificial-turf
fields? And forget that argument on behalf of today's pitching staffs as being
deeper and more talented. The only place they go deeper is in the count.
Today's batters are competing against pitchers throwing off 10-inch mounds at
strike zones that give batters the best of it. DiMaggio and Williams swung
against pitchers delivering from 16-inch mounds toward a bigger and more
consistently determined strike zone.;    DiMaggio, whose all-around ability
has served to somewhat obscure his batting skills, accepted as a challenge his
disadvantage at playing in the House That Ruth Built. Had DiMaggio's career --
from 1936-51 -- not been interrupted by three years' Army service, we can
assume fairly that he could have had about 460 lifetime homers, based on his
average of 33 per season in his first five years, giving him 99 or so more.;  
 In his second season, 1937, DiMaggio hit a career-high 46 home runs. Not
surprisingly, 27 came on the road. The trend was set. In 1950, DiMaggio hit 32
home runs, only nine of them at Yankee Stadium; of his 361 lifetime homers,
213 came on the road, only 148 at home.;    DiMaggio, of course, has a
well-documented mystique. He has been part of Americana from the '30s through
World War II, from his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, through his immortalization
in a Paul Simon '60s lyric, through recognition by a generation simply as
television's "Mr. Coffee," so he needs no press agent. Indeed, the number, 56,
is more indelibly carved into the American fabric than are 37 1/2-23-36 --
M.M.'s numbers, of course. In this way J.D. and M.M. were alike: No numbers
could describe their impact or come close to it.;    I wish that all who will
see them Tuesday night could have seen DiMaggio and Williams play. As DiMaggio
said, Williams was "the greatest hitter I ever saw." Williams, in turn, has
many times said DiMaggio was the "greatest player of my time.";    Few,
however, put the two on the same plane as hitters. Meet one of the few.;   
Williams, too, had a tough park to hit homers in as a left-handed batter. But
Fenway was a great park for all-around hitting. And Ted tore it up for
average, hitting over .400 at home in three different full seasons.;    When
Williams hit .406, his home average was .428. In contrast, DiMaggio's best
average was .381, good for the 1939 batting title. The difference: DiMaggio
hit .416 on the road, but Yankee Stadium confined him to a mere .350.;   
Williams once was asked by his son if DiMaggio was as good a hitter as he was.
Ted is supposed to have explained that DiMaggio, as a right-handed hitter, had
a natural disadvantage. There was always farther to run to first base, and
most often longer distances to conquer for home runs. Anyway, it was a classy
response from Williams, and one DiMaggio deserved.;    Baseball analysis has
come a long way since the time of Joe and Ted. For example, it was only a
little over a year ago that I read the road averages of Williams and DiMaggio
for their careers: DiMaggio, .333; Williams, 328. DiMaggio scored more runs
per game, .80 to .78, and had more RBIs per game, .89 to .80, than did
Williams.;    Those statistics were surprising, and they bolstered what I long
had perceived as a most logical argument: that the park he played in shrunk
DiMaggio's productivity more than is apparent from the general statistics.
There are books that attest to that now, books that say DiMaggio, among many
great hitters, had the most negative park to play in statistically. Bill
James, considered by many the guru of the new numbers cult, came out with a
well-received book, "The Historical Baseball Abstract," several seasons ago.
But even it did not have strikeouts listed for batters. That was about as fair
to DiMaggio as it would have been to judge Marilyn on her figure alone.;   
Just a few things I thought you should know. A fanatic rests his case.;   HOME

LARRY KING GOES TO BAT FOR BABE RUTH MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All shapes and sizes of organizations have tried to recruit Larry King, one of 
the most distinctive voices in America, with the hope he might agree to stand 
up and offer an appeal for this or that cause. But it's not his game. He didn't 
want to be linked with fund-raising, or putting one charity ahead of another. 
So he declined, ever so politely. 
</P>
<P>
He has an imposing stature in the field of broadcasting and, in fact, has 
earned a presence for himself that rivals such luminaries of the past as Arthur 
Godfrey, Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan. There's an ethical awareness that 
prevents him from using his network platform to solicit contributions. 
</P>
<P>
But then along came the Babe Ruth Museum, located in Baltimore, and it asked 
King if he would become national chairman of its membership committee. His 
answer was a ringing acceptance and endorsement of a new campaign that will 
extend the facility's physical dimensions via an extensive expansion effort. 
</P>
<P>
King will be the point man, the personality who is out front selling the idea 
to individuals and corporations all across the nation. "The name Babe Ruth 
catches everyone's attention," he said. "The Babe was symbolic of baseball. He 
was and is baseball." 
</P>
<P>
A historian of a sport he enjoys and understands, King knows Ruth towers above 
all players, past and present, in talent and a sense of the dramatic. King 
never saw Ruth play and wasn't old enough the one year, 1939, when he served as 
a first-base coach for the Brooklyn Dodgers and took batting practice, which 
was a cheap grandstand ploy to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I was in Ebbets Field and heard his farewell speech (April 27, 1947) 
when baseball celebrated Babe Ruth Day all over America. The comments Ruth made 
in Yankee Stadium about what baseball represented to the boys of our country 
and the other things he had to say, with a voice weakened by cancer, were 
pumped into Ebbets Field and to all other ballparks." 
</P>
<P>
What Ruth had to say and how he struggled against the pain to speak in not much 
more than whisper so impressed King that he hasn't forgotten the tugging 
emotion of the moment. "No doubt, he was America's greatest athlete, born and 
raised in Baltimore and, in fact, as a child lived on the exact location where 
center field is going to be located in the new ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of a stadium name, King reiterated his position. "It should be 
Babe Ruth Park," he emphasized. "To ignore Ruth's ties to Baltimore amid so 
much rich background would be some sort of craziness to me. Imagine the 
marketing value of the name. Without Baltimore, plus the Orioles signing him, 
the world never would have heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
And if you want a little-known note about Ruth, listen as King provides it. 
"With all of Ruth's hitting attainments, don't forget he won 94 games as a 
pitcher. And do you realize that in winning percentage against the New York 
Yankees, he stands second in percentage. When he was with the Boston Red Sox, 
he beat the Yanks 17 times and lost only five." 
</P>
<P>
King has long been a Baltimore booster. He was raised in Brooklyn, worked in 
Miami and is now based in Washington. But if he has adopted a city by 
acclamation it would have to be Baltimore. That's because two of his broadcast 
friends, the late Bill O'Donnell and Joe Croghan, continually talked of its 
place in history and what it represented. 
</P>
<P>
So King was impressed. The Orioles draw his personal attention as no other team 
in sports. King is a student of the game, knows its Hall of Fame heroes as well 
as the utility journeymen and talks with in-depth knowledge of the character 
and nuances of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the unprecedented achievement of the Orioles winning seven 
straight pennants in the International League, a dynasty that stands alone in 
the record book. And then he pointed out that Al Kaline, a Baltimore-born Hall 
of Famer, lived only five minutes away from where Ruth was born, the site of 
the museum at 216 Emory St. 
</P>
<P>
More than 28,000 men, women and children visited the "House of Ruth" last year 
and the total should continue to climb. It's the largest baseball museum in the 
country -- next to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- and features 
exhibits that pay tribute to Ruth, to the Orioles and to other distinguished 
Maryland players. 
</P>
<P>
King wants to send out a message to stimulate more interest in the United 
States and Canada among fans, with the enthusiastic expectation they will want 
to go to bat for Ruth, in a manner of speaking and, in turn, enable the museum 
to enlarge. The Babe would've liked that.

THE DAY GEHRIG SAT DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
ON MAY 2, 1939, HIS CONSECUTIVE GAME STREAK ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 2, 1925, Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in 
the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
It took 14 years, 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago, on May 2, 
1939, he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball 
immortality. 
</P>
<P>
The shy son of German immigrants living on New York's East Side never captured 
the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant Ruth did, but when his 
remarkable consecutive-game streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to 
anyone who ever played the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 493 lifetime homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,990 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A .632 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major-league record 23 grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1927, he hit .373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in. He also had 
52 doubles, 18 triples, walked 109 times and scored 149 runs. Yet it was a 
season lost to Ruth's 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 13 full seasons he played, Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season. Henry 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason 
even once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 
strikeouts a year. Reggie Jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of 
baseball's unbreakable records. The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 
straight games by Everett Scott, 823 games (more than five seasons) short of 
Gehrig's mark. 
</P>
<P>
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989, he would have to 
play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, no one has even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from 
Sept. 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey retired after the 1987 season, but if he had kept the streak going in 
1983 and was playing today, he would still be a few games short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig's record," Garvey said. "I 
know I played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and I 
didn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive 
games. He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really something I'm thinking about," Ripken said. "I can't even 
imagine reaching that point. Hey, I'm surprised I've gotten this far. 
</P>
<P>
"I just play one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
A star at Columbia University, Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed 
with the Yankees when offered a $1,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924, Gehrig started his 
streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp, who had been the Yankees' first 
baseman since 1915, told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to 
take the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig took over at first base, and stayed there for 15 years. He stayed 
through muscle pulls, broken bones, and yes, even a slump or two. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 
RBIs. While million-dollar numbers by today's standards, it was far below his 
norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig, whose top salary was $39,000, had a sluggish spring training in 1939 
and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the Iron Horse, "nice play," but Gehrig knew it was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939, Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig knew something was wrong, he just didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1939, was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy: "I'm taking myself out of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided last Sunday night on this move," Gehrig said in announcing his 
decision to the press. "I haven't been a bit of good to the team since the 
season started. It would not be fair to the boys, to Joe or to the baseball 
public for me to try going on. In fact, it would not be fair to myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be 
back soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be as he wished," McCarthy said at the time. "Like 
everybody else I'm sorry to see it happen. I told him not to worry. Maybe the 
warm weather will bring him around." 
</P>
<P>
But the weather had nothing to do with Gehrig's problems. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and it was discovered he had an 
incurable disease. He was diagnosed as having Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there," said former Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen. "But sometimes it 
doesn't seem real now. There was a real Lou Gehrig. A guy who joked with his 
teammates and argued at bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
"But after his last game, he became a legend." 
</P>
<P>
Others have had great numbers, but few more impact on the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I played first base at Yankee Stadium thinking I was 
in the same place Lou Gehrig played," first baseman Don Mattingly said. "It 
almost gave me chills." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Stadium is the "House that Ruth Built," but as long as a team plays 
there, Gehrig will be the pride of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen, "He's what made wearing a Yankee uniform special."

ANAHEIM CLASSIC STIRS MEMORIES OF 1967 GAME AND BABE RUTH-WALTER JOHNSON 
CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Remember way back when the All-Star game was first played in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Sommers remembers. He was one of 46,309 fans nestled comfortably in their 
seats at the nearly new Anaheim Stadium on July 11, 1967, when the Big A 
marquee stood right behind the outfield fence and when there was no permanent 
seating behind center field. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Clair remembers. He was there too. He even has a memento of the game, a 
program that sold for 50 cents at the gate. This year's All-Star program costs 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
And 89-year-old Ernie Johnson remembers. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson wasn't at Anaheim Stadium in 1967 when the National League 
All-Stars clipped the American League All-Stars 2-1 in 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson recalls an Orange County all-star baseball game a few years earlier -- 
1924 to be exact. That was when a barnstorming team headed by New York Yankee 
immortal Babe Ruth played in Brea against another touring team captained by 
favorite son Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators, who, like Ruth, ended 
up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can lay claim to is that I was there when Babe Ruth and 
Walter Johnson played," said Johnson, president of Brea Canyon Oil Co. and no 
relation to the illustrious pitcher. "I was quite a follower of Babe Ruth and 
Johnson. They put on quite a show." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson the oil man said that Johnson the pitcher grew up in Olinda, which is 
known today as Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"He persuaded Babe Ruth to come," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
On that November day nearly 65 years ago, Ruth hit a home run off a Johnson 
pitch but another time he went down swinging. "He could throw that ball hard," 
Johnson said of the pitcher. Nevertheless, Ruth's team won 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
"When Babe Ruth struck at that ball and he missed it, he turned clear around," 
recalled Johnson, one of 5,000 to 16,000 Orange County residents on hand that 
day, depending on which yellowing newspaper account you believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's quite a thing," Johnson concluded. "It attracts a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who will resist the attraction of this year's All-Star game is 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Like Johnson and Johnson (Walter and 
Ernie, that is), Riley played baseball as a young man and has remained a fan. 
But Riley will miss the midsummer classic in Anaheim just as he did in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this morning, I had a call from a friend who invited me to sit in their 
box," Riley said. "I have tickets, but I'm going to give them to a member of 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty much of a baseball fan . . . but Emma Jane (his wife) is not such 
an enthusiastic fan. We sort of compromised and will forgo this one." 
</P>
<P>
Had Riley an opportunity to attend the 1967 game, however, he would have leaped 
at the chance, he said. At that time he was recently retired from the Marine 
Corps and vice president of a Newport Beach manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not recall the hoopla that led up to the 1967 game. But he clearly 
has noted the changes in Orange County that have taken place since. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are still having difficulty with that feeling that we are really 
big boys now," Riley said. "We are really an urban county, second or third 
largest in the state, depending on which day you count." 
</P>
<P>
"We've developed that tremendous stadium. We've really developed a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think it was kind of a remarkable thing that we had 63,000 people?" 
Riley said of the Fourth of July crowd at the stadium for the California 
Angels' game and fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
Like Orange County, Anaheim Stadium has grown in the past 22 years. The 1989 
All-Star game is a sellout, but there will be about 17,000 more seats occupied 
this year than at the 1967 sellout, a dozen years before the addition of two 
tiers of seating beyond the outfield fences. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference this year is that Genevieve Linhoff plans to see the entire 
game from her seat -- and a choice location it is too, right down in the front 
row, smack behind the American League third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Linhoff missed about three innings of the game when unexpected 
last-minute emergencies required her to help out in the stadium ticket office 
where she was employed as secretary to the ticket manager. This year she is 
assistant ticket manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sitting in the seats this time. I'm going to see the whole 
game," Linhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Anaheim has changed" since 1967, Linhoff said. "We were more intimate 
. . . now we're big. Particularly at the stadium. You knew so many of the 
customers. We had fewer people." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many baseball fans, Linhoff is a traditionalist. She wasn't even real 
fond of expanding stadium seating and moving the distinctive Big A from behind 
center field to exile in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like that too well, but it's progress, more capacity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Johnson recalled how progress altered forever another Orange County 
baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1920s a large crowd used to gather outside an Anaheim coffeehouse, 
where the proprietor kept the baseball-hungry throng posted on play-by-play 
developments of the World Series by relaying telegraph bulletins from the East. 
</P>
<P>
On a large board erected outside the eating establishment, the restaurateur had 
denoted bases, the outfield and the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We stood on the opposite side of the street and watched it and sat on the 
curb," Johnson recalled. "He got the reports by telegraph, and he played the 
game out." 
</P>
<P>
"He had . . . lights and he'd ring a bell when there was a hit and he'd tell 
who the batter was. He yelled it out through that window." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, progress intervened and in later years radios became commonplace. There 
soon was always someone who would have more up-to-the-minute news than could be 
provided by the quaint coffee-shop scoreboard, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That began to kind of spoil the thing a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future. Johnson intends to attend Tuesday's All-Star game. Like 
Supervisor Riley, he missed the one in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his wife were enthusiastic about attending, Riley has decided that 
considering "the traffic and all involved, I think I'd feel better if I watched 
it at home" on television.

COURT RULES RUTH NAME IS PRIVATE, IMAGE IS NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Book publishers and baseball memorabilia collectors have scored a major victory 
in a court case about who can publish photographs of Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
New York federal appeals court ruled Monday that, although the Babe's heirs own 
his name, they do not own his image. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed against Macmillan Inc. by Ruth's 
daughters, Dorothy Ruth Pirone and Julia Ruth Stevens, claiming that Macmillan 
had illegally used three photographs of Ruth in a 1988 baseball trivia 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Irving R. Kaufman wrote in his opinion: "Ruth was one of the most 
photographed men of his generation, a larger-than-life hero to millions and a 
historical figure in whom interest still runs high." 
</P>
<P>
While Ruth lived, the judge wrote, he was paid by various manufacturers for the 
use of his picture or name in promoting the sale of various products. After 
Ruth's death in 1948, his daughters registered the words Babe Ruth as a 
trademark for "paper articles, namely playing cards, writing paper and 
envelopes," Kaufman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That trademark has been lucrative. Mark Roesler, president of Curtis Management 
Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing agent, said last December that 
fees paid to the Ruth family were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and were 
expected to grow to $1 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs at issue in the case appeared in the 1988 Macmillan Baseball 
Engagement Calendar. The words Babe Ruth are not on the calendar cover, the 
judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar cover has a photo of Ruth helping a small boy with his batting 
grip. Inside the calendar, there is a photo of the Babe saluting Gen. John 
Pershing and a photo of a baseball autographed by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's daughters objected to the use of Ruth's likeness. Their suit alleged 
federal and common-law trademark infringement and unfair competition, 
infringement of the common law right of publicity and violation of the New York 
Civil Rights Law. The New York law forbids the use for advertising or trade 
purposes of any portrait or picture without the consent of the subject if the 
subject is living. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kaufman acknowledged that there is a valuable commodity in a public 
figure's image, but he said that Ruth's daughters had made much too broad a 
claim.

REMEMBERING THE DAY LOU GEHRIG SAT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 2, 1925, Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in 
the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
It took 14 years, 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago, on May 2, 
1939, he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball 
immortality. 
</P>
<P>
The shy son of German immigrants living on New York's East Side never captured 
the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant Ruth did, but when his 
remarkable consecutive-game streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to 
anyone who ever played the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 493 lifetime homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,990 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A .632 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major-league record 23 grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1927, he hit .373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in. He also had 
52 doubles, 18 triples, walked 109 times and scored 149 runs. Yet it was a 
season lost to Ruth's 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 13 full seasons he played, Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season. Henry 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason 
even once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 
strikeouts a year. Reggie Jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of 
baseball's unbreakable records. The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 
straight games by Everett Scott, 823 games (more than five seasons) short of 
Gehrig's mark. 
</P>
<P>
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989, he would have to 
play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, no one has even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from 
Sept. 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey retired after the 1987 season, but if he had kept the streak going in 
1983 and was playing today, he would still be a few games short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig's record," Garvey said. "I 
know I played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and I 
didn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive 
games. He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really something I'm thinking about," Ripken said. "I can't even 
imagine reaching that point. Hey, I'm surprised I've gotten this far. 
</P>
<P>
"I just play one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
A star at Columbia University, Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed 
with the Yankees when offered a $1,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924, Gehrig started his 
streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp, who had been the Yankees' first 
baseman since 1915, told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to 
take the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig took over at first base, and stayed there for 15 years. He stayed 
through muscle pulls, broken bones, and yes, even a slump or two. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 
RBIs. While million-dollar numbers by today's standards, it was far below his 
norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig, whose top salary was $39,000, had a sluggish spring training in 1939 
and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the Iron Horse, "nice play," but Gehrig knew it was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939, Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig knew something was wrong, he just didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1939, was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy: "I'm taking myself out of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided last Sunday night on this move," Gehrig said in announcing his 
decision to the press. "I haven't been a bit of good to the team since the 
season started. It would not be fair to the boys, to Joe or to the baseball 
public for me to try going on. In fact, it would not be fair to myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be 
back soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be as he wished," McCarthy said at the time. "Like 
everybody else I'm sorry to see it happen. I told him not to worry. Maybe the 
warm weather will bring him around." 
</P>
<P>
But the weather had nothing to do with Gehrig's problems. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and it was discovered he had an 
incurable disease. He was diagnosed as having Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig's disease.

RUTH BROUGHT BASEBALL ROARING INTO THE '20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy years ago today, a first-year outfielder for the New York Yankees hit 
his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a 
doubleheader at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So, George Herman (Babe) Ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season. 
In the next several weeks, he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home 
runs, too. 
</P>
<P>
He was on his way to a home run record that, in 1920, was almost beyond belief 
-- he would hit 54, then 59 in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Reference points: When Ruth hit 54 in 1920, the second-highest total in 
baseball that year was 19, by George Sisler. Only one other team in the 
American League that year hit more than 44 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon, it was the 138th of Ruth's career, 
making him, at 25, the all-time home run leader. Many baseball historians claim 
today that Ruth's 1920 and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by 
any hitter in baseball history. And many even believe either season was 
superior to his more famous 1927 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth played in only 142 games in 1920, yet drove in 137 runs. His home run 
percentage that season was 11.8%, compared to 1927, when it was 11.1% as he hit 
60 in 151 games. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive of all, Ruth's slugging percentages in 1920 and '21 were 
.847 and .846. Neither figure has ever been approached. In fact, a slugging 
percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times, eight by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever. His .772 mark for 1927 is 
No. 3. No. 4 is Lou Gehrig's .765 in 1927. Ruth and Gehrig are on the top-20 
list 11 times. The most recent player to make the top 20 was Ted Williams, who 
hit .731 in 1957 to rank 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth joined the Yankees after the 1919 season, when Boston sold him to New 
York. In his last Red Sox season, playing in 130 games, Ruth was 9-5 as a 
pitcher, and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1920, no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a 
season. Only three had ever hit 20, and one was Ruth. Three late-19th Century 
players hit between 20 and 27 home runs, but some of those, it is believed, 
were inside-the-park homers, many coming in fenceless ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1920, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production. As recently 
as 1918, Ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches. The Yankees, who after two 
more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium, 
a.k.a. "The House that Ruth Built" -- became the first team to draw 1 million 
fans in a season, in 1920. They drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous 
attendance mark by 380,000.

<LEADPARA>  JOHN Goodman is scoring a home run with his portrayal of the legendary Babe
Ruth for the Universal big-screen cameras.;    "His transformation is
awesome," reports John Fusco, writer and producer of "The Babe." He adds,
"I've spent the last two years studying newsreel footage of Babe Ruth -- and
I'm looking at him now. John Goodman is the Babe."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Speaking from Chicago's Wrigley Field during filming of a re-enactment of
the 1932 World Series, Fusco said of his star, "John's transformation has been
uncanny. He lost about 60 pounds for the role. He went through a rigorous
training period to learn to execute a Ruthian swing -- an incredibly powerful
left-handed swing. He does Ruth's classic home run trot. He's got his speech
mannerisms down pat. Sometimes it's spooky. Even now, in our seventh week of
production, he's constantly studying footage of the Babe in his trailer. It's
John's first dramatic starring role -- and he's shown an incredible level of
concentration.";    "The Babe," slated for release at the beginning of next
year's baseball season, is scheduled to complete production the end of the
month -- just days before Goodman's "Roseanne" series revs up for the new
season.;  NEW WOMEN: "Designing Women" starts new season production July 29,
with a story that will incorporate new "Women" Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks into
the cast. Gone, of course, is battlin' Delta Burke, who's been dropped from
the show, and Jean Smart's only going to be around for an occasional episode.
"Jean will do the first couple," says producer Harry Thomason, "and then we'll
play it by ear." Hooks will be playing Smart's sister, recently divorced from
the biggest mobile home dealer in the Southwest. Duffy will come aboard as a
cousin to Dixie Carter and Burke's Sugarbaker sisters.;  PLAYING GODDESS:
Susan Griffiths, who wrapped work as Marilyn Monroe in ABC's "Marilyn &amp; Me"
movie earlier this month, is already girding herself for the critical flogging
she figures could come when the production airs this fall. "I'm kind of
putting myself on the chopping block by doing this," admits the 26-year-old
actress, who's playing 20ish Norma Jean Baker (Monroe) in the movie detailing
the relationship between the screen icon and writer Bob Slatzer -- who claims
to have been Monroe's second husband. "I hope the movie's taken for what it
is, a beautiful love story -- whether or not they believe Bob's account," says
Griffiths (who does). No matter how "Marilyn &amp; Me" is received, she doesn't
plan to continue playing Monroe after it airs. Having made a part-time career
as a Monroe look-alike since age 17 -- with three Japanese commercials, a
Vegas stage act, and now, the ABC telepic -- "I've done it. I can't imagine
playing her in anything better than 'Marilyn &amp; Me' -- and I'd really like to
do more as myself now.";  By St. Clair Pugh and Denis Ferrara for Liz Smith in
New York;    DOUBLE DEBUT: Two of television's most popular women, Stephanie
Zimbalist and Linda Purl, are going to be treading the off-Broadway boards in
their New York stage debuts. Zimbalist and Purl will star in Jane Anderson's
acclaimed play "The Baby Dance," which explores the emotionally charged issue
of adoption.;    This drama began its journey to New York in February 1990,
when it premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse. It was extended twice by popular
demand, finally moving eastward to the Williamstown Theater Festival and a
recent engagement at New Haven, Conn.'s, Long Wharf. Set to star opposite
Zimbalist and Purl are Richard Lineback, Joel Polis and John Bennett Perry.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  BOBBY THOMSON will turn 68 on Oct. 25, and you'd think by now he would be
retired not only from baseball but from the real world. You'd expect him to be
reaping everything one might expect from an individual who produced what Roger
Angell has called "the most vivid single moment, the grand exclamation point,
in the history of the pastime," or what the late Red Smith tried to describe
as "the inexpressibly fantastic.";   He's not. "I live a very normal working
man's life here," Thomson said by phone recently from his home in Watchung,
N.J. "I've been working ever since I got out of baseball."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A PLACE IN HISTORY
FORTY YEARS LATER, THAT'S THOMSON'S ONLY REWARD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Thomson handles East Coast sales for a Chicago-based container company,
working in the browncraft segment and dealing in grocery sacks and corrugated
boxes.;   Maybe it's the price you pay for baseball immortality, but it
doesn't seem right. He should be forever young, still dancing around the bases
and diving into a tide of teammates, or at the very least removed from
commonality.;   He doesn't complain, not even with so much justification.
Today's player can parlay the smallest achievement into a fortune. Do today
what Thomson did in 1951, and you're set for quite a few lifetimes.;  
"There's nothing to be happy or unhappy about -- what the hell, it's there for
them, so why not get it?" Thomson said. . . . It's not like when we played,
when you signed a one-year contract and got paid for what you did the year
before. These guys are getting paid money that they haven't even earned yet.
It's not good business.";   Trying not to sound like an old-school cliche, he
paused and said, "It's not for me to judge, but it probably would have been a
little different for me if I had done that today.";   What Thomson did was hit
the most dramatic home run in baseball history, the "Shot Heard 'Round The
World." It came off Ralph Branca on Oct. 3, 1951, in the bottom of the ninth
inning of the third and final playoff game, beating the loathed Brooklyn
Dodgers 5-4 and completing the New York Giants' comeback from 13 1/2 games out
on Aug. 11 to the National League pennant.;   What Thomson did was write the
gist of his own epitaph with one swing of the bat. The current Giants
management phoned him a while back, when the team was making a stirring
comeback from 15 games out to within six of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The club
wanted to know about his schedule, with the possibility that there would be a
Bobby Thomson Day on Oct. 3. Although the Giants and the promotion idea faded
away, Thomson said, "It's nice this thing is still kicking around. It's nice
to be remembered.";   Vivid memory; Ernie Harwell remembers it like yesterday.
He and Russ Hodges were Giants broadcasters then, one on radio and one on
television, which had just gone coast-to-coast. On this day, it was Harwell's
turn to be in the TV booth for the first and last three innings.;   They made
the switch after the sixth, when the Dodgers were milking a 1-0 lead and the
crowd at the Polo Grounds was growing restless. Thomson tied the score in the
seventh with a sacrifice fly, but the Dodgers scored three in the eighth and
still had starting pitcher Don Newcombe on the mound.;   The Giants cut it to
4-2 in the bottom of the ninth on two seeing-eye grounders and an RBI double
by Whitey Lockman. The Giants and many others thought Newk still had it, and
Dodgers Manager Charley Dressen wasn't sure. Acting on players' advice at a
mound meeting, he called for Branca.;   Branca's plan; Branca had given up a
homer to Thomson that decided Game 1, and he wanted to get ahead in the count
this time. He succeeded by throwing a fastball for a called strike. The plan
was to come back with a fastball up and in, where Thomson supposedly was
vulnerable, and then Branca would be able to waste a third pitch for a
breaking ball low and away. That was the plan.;   Thomson swung at the second
pitch, and crack: Every eye followed the ball's flight to left field. It
sailed over Andy Pafko's head and into the seats. Thomson pranced around the
bases and leaped into awaiting arms at the plate.;   Two different views;
"It's gone," was all that Harwell said, letting the TV picture tell the story.
He adds today: "I had a little misgiving -- 'Am I calling it too early?' But
it made it over the wall, and I just stayed quiet for a while, let the crowd
noise take over, and then, after what seemed two or three minutes -- actually
30 or 40 seconds, they swung the camera around on me and I did a little recap.
Our TV setup was not as refined as it is now.";   In the booth next door,
Hodges was going wild: "Bobby Thomson up there swinging. . . . Brooklyn leads
it 4-2. . . . Branca throws. . . . There's a long drive. . . . It's gonna be.
. . . I believe. . . . The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! . . . Bobby Thomson
hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands and they're going crazy!
Yaaaaho-o-o-o-o!";   The aftermath; Branca was found later on the steps
leading from the Dodgers' clubhouse to the trainer's room, lying on his
stomach, weeping and muttering pitifully, "Why me? Why me?";   Thomson was on
a cloud for the longest time, and it carried him that night onto the Perry
Como Show.;   The Giants went on to lose the World Series to the Yankees;
Thomson went on to a decent career and a longer one in sales; and Branca never
got that pitch back but did develop a lasting friendship with his rival. The
two sign baseballs together, their paths inextricably interwoven.;   "Now it
is done," Red Smith wrote. "Now the story ends. And there is no way to tell
it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the
utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible
again."; BIG SHOTS;   (box) THE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD (Oct. 3, 1951):
Bobby Thomson hit a high-and-tight fastball from Brooklyn reliever Ralph
Branca over the left-field wall for a three-run homer, giving the Giants a 5-4
ninth-inning victory and a pennant in the deciding game of a three-game
playoff.;   (box) MAZ'S MIRACLE (Oct. 13, 1960): The New York Yankees scored
two runs in the top of the ninth inning to tie the score at 9-9 in Game 7 of
the World Series, but Pittsburgh's Bill Mazeroski hit the winning homer off
Yankees reliever Ralph Terry.;   (box) MARIS' 61ST (Oct. 1, 1961): Roger Maris
had one game left to break the hallowed single-season record of Babe Ruth, and
he sent a waist-high fastball from Boston's Tracy Stallard 15 rows deep to
right field at Yankee Stadium.;   (box) HOMER IN THE GLOAMIN' (Sept. 28,
1938): The Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates were tied for the N.L. lead and
they were tied 5-5 going into the bottom of the ninth on the final day of the
season. If no one scored in that half, it would be declared a draw. With two
out in semi-darkness at Wrigley Field, Gabby Hartnett, the Cubs' catcher and
manager, hit the pennant-winning homer.;   (box) CARLTON FISK'S FAIR BALL
(Oct. 21, 1975): Boston's Bernie Carbo tied Game 6 of the World Series with a
three-run pinch-homer in the eighth inning, and it remained 6-6 going into the
bottom of the 12th. Carlton Fisk swung at the second pitch from Cincinnati
reliever Pat Darcy and hit it toward the left-field foul pole. He applied body
English as the ball went just fair, and he danced around the basepaths.;  
(box) BABE RUTH'S 'CALLED' HOMER (Oct. 1, 1932): Ruth hit 15 homers in 10
World Series, and his last one was by far the most famous. Or at least, the
most controversial. In the fifth inning of Game 3 at Wrigley, Cubs
right-hander Charlie Root threw a called strike to Ruth, and the batter held
up one finger in accordance with the call. Two balls later, there was another
called strike and another such gesture by Ruth. It appeared to some people
that Ruth then pointed to the center-field bleachers, and on the next pitch he
hit one to the very spot, the longest homer anyone had hit there.; -- Mercury

Cecil Fielder became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle did it 29 years ago, connecting Wednesday night in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," Fielder said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since George Foster of the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from New York Yankee rookie Steve Adkins into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put Detroit ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off Alan Mills into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at Yankee Stadium. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was Mantle, who hit 54 homers to Maris' 
record 61 in 1961 in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

Cecil Fielder became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle did it 29 years ago, connecting Wednesday night in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," Fielder said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since George Foster of the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from New York Yankee rookie Steve Adkins into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put Detroit ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off Alan Mills into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at Yankee Stadium. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was Mantle, who hit 54 homers to Maris' 
record 61 in 1961 in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

<P>
There may not be baseball this spring -- thanks to the ongoing dispute between 
owners and players -- but there will be baseball videos to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of St. Louis" and "The Babe Ruth Story" (both from CBS/Fox, $19.98 
each) aren't exactly up to "Bull Durham" in quality, but at least these two 
filmographies from 40 years ago will fill in a few hours with the sound of 
balls hitting bats and fists hitting gloves to comfort TV-game-less addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of St. Louis" is the better of the two. The 1952 film tells the 
story of one of the game's most colorful characters, pitcher (and later NBC 
announcer) Dizzy Dean. Dan Dailey plays Diz in a movie that doesn't quite 
convince but does entertain. 
</P>
<P>
Even less believable is "The Babe Ruth Story," a flat, whitewashed 1948 
biography of the man who's generally considered the best in the game's history. 
William Bendix is suitably irrepressible as the Babe, but otherwise baseball 
fans will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox is also re-releasing "The Pride of the Yankees" (also $19.98), 
previously available from Key Video. A far better film than the other two, this 
1942 drama starred Gary Cooper as Ruth's most notable teammate, the great 
slugger Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
And coming next week: "Field of Dreams" (March 8). 
</P>
<P>
Old baseball films aren't the only vintage videos CBS/Fox is offering this 
week. Under the banner of "Classic Romances," these four new releases are 
$39.98 each: 
</P>
<P>
"Desk Set" (1957). Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in a lightweight but 
enjoyable comedy about the introduction of a computer to the research 
department of a business, much to the researchers' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven Can Wait" (1943). Not to be confused with the Warren Beatty movie of 
the same name, this Ernst Lubitsch film is an ironic, sophisticated 
comedy/fantasy about a man (Don Ameche) who tells his life story to the devil 
in an attempt to figure out if he's been put in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" (1947). More sophisticated comedy -- this time from 
Joseph L. Mankiewicz -- about a young widow (Gene Tierney) and the ghost of a 
sea captain (Rex Harrison) who inhabits the house she moves into. 
</P>
<P>
"An Affair to Remember" (1957). Leo McCarey directed this OK but flawed remake 
of his superior 1939 film "Love Affair." Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr help make 
this shipboard comedy palatable. 
</P>
<P>
One other notable oldie, from Warner ($59.95), is "Goodby, My Lady" -- not a 
great film, but a touching and well-made one about a boy (the reliable Brandon 
de Wilde) and his dog. Walter Brennan, Phil Harris and a young Sidney Poitier 
also enliven the sentimental picture. 
</P>
<P>
The newer movies making their way to video this week are considerably less 
interesting, including the silly, unfunny Australian comedy "Young Einstein" 
(Warner, $89.95, PG) and the putrid horror sequel "Halloween 5: The Revenge of 
Michael Myers" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, R). TERRY ATKINSON

If there's one thing Mickey (Himself) Hatcher could always do, it was hit a 
baseball. Hard. Somewhere. Often. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't all that good throwing it, catching it. But give him a bat and he is a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing he can do is smile. If you walk into a locker room, the one 
with the big grin is Mickey. His attitude is infectious. One of the most dour 
creatures in the world is the ballplayer who has just gone zero for four or 
been knocked out of the box in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey just lets it roll off his back. He has always managed to look as if he 
has just hit the game-winning home run. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, he did. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
The home run everyone remembers -- and always will remember -- from the 1988 
season is the one Kirk Gibson hit with two out in the ninth inning of Game 1. 
It's one of the most famous home runs in baseball history. It won the game, 
maybe the Series. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk Gibson might not even have been to bat if Mickey Hatcher hadn't hit a 
less famous but equally effective home run in the first inning of that game. 
The Dodgers would never have been in position to pull that game -- and series 
-- out of the fire in the ninth if Mickey Hatcher hadn't hit a two-run homer in 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson is supposed to hit home runs. He was hitting his 28th home run of 
the season. Hatcher was hitting his second. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 5, Hatcher did it again -- walloping another two-run homer in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time a pitching staff had underestimated this Mick who 
wasn't Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
This Mickey manages to look in the batter's box like a little kid playing 
stickball in the streets. He stands in there with this lopsided grin, his 
stockings kind of sag. So does he. The cap is at a rakish angle. He looks a 
little bit like Bugs Bunny at the plate. All he needs is the carrot. 
</P>
<P>
When most people hit home runs, they go around the bases like a Pope. It's not 
even a trot, it's a procession. They stop and bow. Wave their caps. Jeffrey 
Leonard goes around the bases like Cleopatra's barge. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher goes around as if a posse is after him. He and Pete Rose hold 
the listed world records for circling the bases on home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher is a throwback to the days when baseball was a game, not a business. He 
is actually a very considerable athlete -- he was a wide receiver for Barry 
Switzer's University of Oklahoma football team, for example. He has pretty good 
speed. He can hit anything that doesn't hit him first. Mickey doesn't require 
of a pitch that it be a strike. Just in the air, is all he wants. 
</P>
<P>
He is a born hitter. Every time you see in a record book where Mickey Hatcher 
has played in 100 games or more a season, you can make book he has hit .300 or 
close to it. If you throw the ball outside, he hits it into right field. If you 
throw it inside, as the Oakland Athletics pitchers found, he hits it in the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
His problem has always been getting in a lineup. He came up with the Dodgers as 
a third baseman in the days when the team already had one -- Ron Cey. Hatcher 
batted .371, hit 10 homers and drove in 93 runs in his only real full season 
with the minor league Albuquerque Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
On the Dodgers, he just became Ron Cey's caddie -- or Dusty Baker's. The guy 
who goes in for the late innings to give the regular a rest. He got in only 33 
games one year and 57 another. The year he played in 57, he got only 84 
at-bats. He wasn't even a utility man. He was an irregular. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey remained cheerful. Many another player would have tossed helmets, busted 
up lockers, roared, "Play me or trade me!" Mickey just filled in the time 
playing practical jokes. When someone put lampblack on Kirk Gibson's cap last 
year, nobody on the club suspected the real culprit, Jesse Orosco. Everybody 
would have bet on Hatcher as the jokester. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher figures his horseplay is just a way of cutting tension. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to keep everybody in a good frame of mind," he says. "When I see a 
guy who has just struck out sitting in a corner of the dugout all by himself, 
biting his lip, I just try to get him so he isn't down on himself. I mean, Babe 
Ruth struck out, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth might have struck out but Mickey Hatcher doesn't very often -- only 
seven times all last year. He usually strikes out only every other eclipse of 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
So, why did he never become a star? 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher says it's because he always played too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I got a chance to play, I hit a wall," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He got carried out of Fenway Park on a stretcher once with what was feared to 
be a broken neck. He collided with the famous Green Monster while chasing a 
line drive in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, he got hit on the wrist with a pitch in mid-season -- and found 
out after the season was over that he played since then with a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't crack the Dodger lineup while Cey and Baker were in it and, when he 
got traded to Minnesota, he found Gary Gaetti in his way. Still, the only year 
in his major league career he got over 500 at-bats, he hit better than .300 -- 
.302, in fact -- drove in 69 runs and scored 61. 
</P>
<P>
"I put the bat on the ball," he admits. "I'm the kind of hitter the pitchers 
hate to see come up. I either have no weakness -- or I'm all weakness. They 
make a good pitch and I flare it somewhere for a double. They try to waste a 
pitch and I hit it off a wall. I drive them nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Most World Series heroes, when they star in a game, can tell you all about it 
-- not only how many were on base but who. Also, who was pitching, what he 
threw, the direction of the wind, time of day, relative humidity, where the 
pitch was, what the count was, what the temperature was and whether the infield 
was playing in or back. 
</P>
<P>
About all Mickey Hatcher can remember is who was President. 
</P>
<P>
He can't for the life of him remember the circumstances of the two homers and 
the five RBIs he had in the series. Hatcher has no memory for trivia. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Mickey's first Series home run was hit off Dave Stewart. The 
Oakland pitcher had just hit leadoff batter Steve Sax, apparently in 
retaliation for Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher having hit the A's Jose Canseco in 
Oakland's half of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Stewart hit the wrong batter. He should have saved the get-even pitch 
for Hatcher. Because Mickey Hatcher hit the first pitch into the left-field 
seats for a 2-0 Los Angeles lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers hadn't put Mickey in the lineup for his bat but for his attitude. 
It happened after the first game in the playoff series against the New York 
Mets. The Dodgers, leading, 2-0, going into the ninth, had blown the lead and 
the game. The team was down. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tommy Lasorda remembers looking over and seeing a crestfallen lot of 
ballplayers. All except Mickey Hatcher, who was going around with his hat on 
backward, making faces. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets didn't bother Mickey Hatcher. Nothing bothers Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
World Series heroes come in all shapes and sizes. They're often as unlikely as 
Pepper Martin in 1931 or as predictable as Babe Ruth in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
But none ever took over a Series as a hitter any more thoroughly than Mickey 
(Himself) Hatcher and his two home runs and a double and four singles did in 
1988. He has a hard job remembering them but the rest of baseball will never 
forget them.

<TEXT>
   I am sitting with Stanley Kuttner in the family room of his home, watching the baseball game on television. 
The first-place Chicago Cubs are playing the Montreal Expos. 
It's the fifth inning, the score is tied at zero, and the Cubs have put runners on second and third bases with none out. 
But the next batter pops out and the next strikes out, and it looks like the Cubs will come up empty. 

   Then Expo catcher Nelson Santovenia lets a low, outside pitch get past him to the screen, and the Cubs score after all. 
That's the kind of season it's been. 
The TV screen records the Wrigley Field bedlam, and also flashes the news that the Pittsburgh Pirates have gone ahead of the second-place St. Louis Cardinals, 5-0, in St. Louis. 
If the Cubs win and Cards lose (as it turns out they do), the Cubs would be 4 1/2 games ahead with 17 games to play in the National League East, the TV voice whoops. 

   We sit quietly. 
When the noise subsides, I ask Stanley if he thinks the Cubs can do it -- that is, win the pennant. 
A long pause ensues. 
"I don't know. 
They're the Cubs," he says finally. 
"But maybe the other teams are worse this year." 

   Such phlegm and caution is bred of experience. 
Stanley is 73 years old, and a lifelong Cubs fan. 
He knows better than most that, down the years, the team has been far more the done-unto than the doer. 
He was there when the Cubs established their reputation as baseball's all-time patsies. 
Yes, he was there, a short, wiry 16-year-old in the right-field bleachers at Wrigley Field, on Oct. 1, 1932, when the great New York Yankee slugger Babe Ruth, goaded by the Cubs' bench, was said to have pointed toward the center-field seats and then hit a prodigious home run to the same spot. 

   The homer is the basis of baseball's most lustrious legend, which only has been magnified by the 57-year debate over whether Ruth really called his shot. 
With the Cubs again courting playoff or World Series disaster, the time seemed ripe for a revisit. 
You were there, Stanley. 
Did The Babe point? 

   Before I reveal his answer, let me assure you that Kuttner is not some old guy who has been sitting around his family room, waiting to talk about something that happened -- or didn't happen -- in 1932. 
Still wiry and still short, he is a man of parts and participations, a husband, father of five daughters and granddad of eight. 
Growing up on Chicago's North Side, he played American Legion baseball against Phil Cavarretta, later the first baseman and leader of the Cubs' last pennant winner, in 1945. 
Stanley played second base for one team, Cavarretta pitched for another. 
Stanley did not get a hit off Cavarretta. 

   He served in the Army during World War II, mopping up after the Marines on Guadalcanal and storming the beaches of New Georgia in the Solomons. 
I asked if he had any war stories. 
He said he had one. 

   "They sent me home in 1944 to guard prisoners at Camp McCoy in Wisconsin," he says. 
"I met a Japanese prisoner who spoke some English. 
He told me he'd been shot on New Georgia. 
I told him I'd shot him. 
We both had a good laugh." 

   After the war, he joined the Chicago advertising firm started by his two brothers and sister. 
He retired as a partner three years ago. 
When golf, tennis and bowling paled, he sought part-time work. 
"The woman at the employment agency asked me what I could do. 
I told her I couldn't do anything -- I'd been an executive," he says. 
He now does odd office jobs for a suburban newspaper chain, in addition to playing golf and tennis, and bowling. 

   He also watches baseball, but not as much as before. 
"The game takes too long now," he says. 
"In the old days, games started at 3 p.m. and ended around 4:30. 
Now they start at 1:30 and they're still playing at 4:30." 
So he watches mostly on TV, and can do other things when he gets antsy. 

   As a kid, though, he considered baseball a supreme treat. 
"My family always lived around Wrigley Field," he recalls. 
"We lived at Beacon and Montrose, and on Ainslie, and later at Diversey and Pine Grove. 
Some of the Cubs lived in hotels around Diversey, too, and I got to know them. 
When Dizzy Dean was with the team, he and I and Billy Herman and his brother-in-law went drinking one night. 
I was only 21 or 22, but I held my liquor better than Dean did. 

   "My brother, Chester, and I went to lots of games when we were teen-agers. 
Sometimes we'd go after school, sometimes instead of school. . . . 
Naturally, when the Cubs won the pennant in 1932, we wanted to see a World Series game," he goes on. 
"The first one in Chicago was on a Saturday, and Chester and I got to the ballpark Friday night to get in line for tickets. 
We stayed there all night. 
We got good seats, but we were mad because other people showed up at 9 or 10 a.m. on Saturday and did nearly as well. 

   "I remember a lot about the game. 
There were several homers. 
Ruth hit one in the first inning. 
The Cubs hit a couple. 
Ruth came up again in the fifth. 
You could see him looking into the Cubs' dugout, moving his head like he was talking to them. 
Then he waved his bat toward the bleachers and hit his home run. 
When he rounded the bases, you could see him talking to the Cubs some more. 

   "I didn't think any more of it right then. 
It wasn't like everybody was talking about how he pointed, and then hit one. 
But later, when I read things about the 'called shot,' I thought, 'Yeah, that's what he did.'" 

   I felt obliged to mention that most writers who had delved into the incident had concluded that Ruth hadn't pointed, with bat or hand. 
Robert Creamer, in his wonderful biography of The Babe, sifted press accounts of the game and found only one that specifically said he had. 

   Stanley Kuttner is unimpressed. 
"Sportswriters don't know everything," he notes, correctly. 
"Anyway," he smiles, "it's a better story my way, don't you think?"

<LEADPARA>  The most famous asterisk in sports may disappear from the record books if a
baseball committee follows Commissioner Fay Vincent's recommendation to give
full respect to Roger Maris' 30-year-old home run record.;    Vincent wants to
drop Babe Ruth's 60 homers from the record books and give unqualified
recognition to Maris' 61.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Vincent said Thursday that the eight-member committee for statistical
accuracy will meet in September to consider the issue. The panel, chaired by
Vincent, is composed of two other baseball officials, a statistician, two
sportswriters and two professors.;    "I'm inclined . . . to support the
single-record thesis, and that is Maris hit more home runs in a season than
anyone else," said Vincent, who was inspired by a Roger Angell article in May
27's New Yorker.;    The issue was first decided by Commissioner Ford Frick on
July 17, 1961, when Maris had 35 homers and was three weeks ahead of Ruth's
pace.;    Maris hit his 61st home run in the New York Yankees' final game of
the season. It was the first year of the expansion era, and the schedule had
been expanded to 162 games from 154, its length when Ruth hit 60 for the
Yankees in 1927.;    Frick died in 1978, Maris in 1985.;    For the record,
there is no actual asterisk. Therecord books list both marks -- with a
notation.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  CREATING almost as much stir as Stephen Lang's portrayal of "Babe Ruth" in
tonight's NBC movie is the man who plays baseball legend Ty Cobb in the film:
Pete Rose.;   A baseball immortal himself, Rose took on his first acting role

that ended with his being banned from baseball for life in 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the film, Rose has just one scene as Cobb with Lang's Babe Ruth. Ruth is
eager to become a baseball manager; so he meets with Cobb, then player-manager
of the Detroit Tigers, to see how he likes it.;   Ironically, Rose, years
later, also was a player-manager for his team, the Cincinnati Reds. He also
was known as a "hustling" ballplayer like Cobb and, in fact, was the man who
broke Cobb's record for total hits.;   "It just seemed to be a perfect
choice," said producer Frank Pace. "Rose named his son after Ty Cobb and knows
more about Cobb than possibly any person living.";   But there were limits to
how Rose could be used in the film. Organized baseball refused to permit Rose
to appear in a major league uniform and wouldn't allow him to be photographed
at a ballpark. One ballpark scene where Cobb disputes an umpire's call on Ruth
was canceled. Rose appears in street clothes in a hotel room for his only
scene as Cobb.;   How does Rose perform as an actor? This critic thinks he's
fine in a very small part, but Executive Producer Lawrence Lyttle, the man who
signed Rose's paycheck, offers a professional opinion:;   "He has a natural
cadence about his acting, and he was absolutely charming. I think everybody's
going to be surprised at just how natural he is as a performer." (box)  </TEXT>

   Iron man Lou Gehrig will be featured on a new
commemorative postage stamp this summer, the Postal Service reported
Tuesday.
   The stamp honoring the former New York Yankees hitter will be
issued June 10 at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Gehrig played a record 2,130 consecutive games, batting cleanup
behind slugger Babe Ruth in the Yankees' famous ``Murderer's Row''
lineup.
   During his career, Gehrig hit 493 home runs, driving in 100 or
more runs 13 seasons in a row and batting .340 lifetime.
   Gehrig took the field for the Yankees June 2, 1925, and didn't
miss a game until May 2, 1939, after he was diagnosed as suffering
from the fatal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. That disease
has since come to be known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

IN RED'S BOOK, TEAMS OF TODAY DON'T RATE WITH ALL-TIME BEST

<P>
Just past the midpoint of a season in which the Dodgers are shakily defending a 
World Series championship, baseball's best teams might be the Oakland Athletics 
and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But how do these two compare with the better champions of the century? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, they don't -- at least not yet -- if you're consulting Arthur E. 
(Red) Patterson, who has been following the game for about 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently an Angel executive, Patterson, 80, began as a sportswriter for 
the old New York Herald-Tribune before moving to the New York Yankees and then 
the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"My test is continuity -- the ability to repeat as a pennant winner," he said, 
noting that there have been no repeaters in the decade since 1977-78, when the 
Dodgers and Yankees met in successive Octobers. "I think baseball is more 
interesting now than ever, and the clubs today are better balanced than they 
were 30 or 40 years ago, but there has only been one great team in the last 
quarter century." 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, was Charlie O. Finley's 1972-73-74 A's, who rank third in 
Patterson's all-time top 10. 
</P>
<P>
On top are two Yankee machines, the 1926-27-28 clubs with Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig, and the multiple champions of the 1930s and early '40s, the players who 
won so many pennants and World Series that they inspired an American League war 
cry: "Break up the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
In Patterson's top 10 -- a collection of 10 champions that all meet his 
criteria -- the first five are the 1927 Yankees, 1939 Yankees, 1974 A's, 1951 
Yankees and 1922 New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
His next five: the 1929 Philadelphia A's, 1955 Dodgers, 1963 Dodgers, 1907 
Chicago Cubs and 1916 Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest regret is that there isn't room there for the St. Louis Gas House 
Gang," he said, naming the 1934 Cardinals 11th and following with the 1913 A's, 
1931 Cardinals, 1940 Cincinnati Reds and 1936 Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding irony of baseball in this century, Patterson said, is the 
increasingly high quality of the modern game combined with the possibility that 
there won't be another team to compare with those now in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Free agency and the draft have made it a new game," he said, mentioning the 
revolutionary baseball changes that took root in the 1970s, tearing apart, 
among others, Finley's Oakland champions. "These days, you can't put together 
dynasty-type players and keep them together. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft is the biggest change. In the great days of the Yankees in the '30s, 
'40s, and '50s, all they had to do was identify the nation's outstanding young 
prospects -- that is, scout them -- and sign them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to scout them, draft them, and sign them. That makes an enormous 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
He noted Joe DiMaggio, a Hall of Famer who might have gone to a Yankee rival in 
a 1930s draft. 
</P>
<P>
Or, Patterson said: "If there'd been free agency, someone would have picked him 
off, most likely, for a million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the game is now, if you think you win the pennant with one more proven 
player, you grab him as a free agent -- and there goes somebody else's 
dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson approves, nonetheless, of the modern way. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is a fan's delight today," he said. "Baseball has never been so well 
played. The talk about the dilution of talent with so many teams is just plain 
wrong. Baseball could easily expand again. 
</P>
<P>
"Pro basketball and football have siphoned off some players, of course. That 
never used to happen. And TV has knocked out some of the minor leagues. But 
despite all that, there's so much talent now and such good coaching, in the 
colleges as well as the minors, that the game keeps getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the superstars who are remembered from the past. Today, every baseball 
roster is stronger, down through the 23rd or 24th man, than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson is an expert on what used to be. He's been a close student of the big 
leagues since age 12, when an uncle took him to his first game, a Dodger-Giant 
game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 he joined the Yankees for eight years as road secretary, publicist and 
home run tape measurer. Then he spent 20 years with the Dodgers in Brooklyn and 
Los Angeles before taking over as president of the Angels in 1975. He remains 
an Angel consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who went to night school at New York University when he was working 
days for the Herald-Tribune, was one of four sons of a New York area mill 
superintendent. He and his wife, residents of Fullerton, have five children, 15 
grandchildren and a great grandchild, most of them baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 1907 Cubs and 1916 Red Sox are the only great teams of the century 
that he never personally scouted. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1927 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
The quotes are Patterson's: 
</P>
<P>
"You can always get lucky once. So you've got to do it more than once to meet 
the test of greatness. Secondly, you can't embarrass yourself in the World 
Series. Those are the two things I think about first. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '20s, (Manager) Miller Huggins' Yankees qualified in both respects, 
winning three straight pennants and then the World Series in '27 and '28." 
</P>
<P>
Along with most old-timers, Patterson ranks the 1927 Yankees as the century's 
No. 1 ballclub, in large part because Ruth hit his 60 home runs that year, and 
Gehrig hit 47 and batted in 175 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1927, the Yankees won 110 games in a 154-game season. That's dominance, 
that's greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's teammates in the 1927 outfield were Earle Combs, whose lifetime-best 231 
hits led the league that season, and Bob Meusel, whose .337 batting average and 
.510 slugging average were also career bests. 
</P>
<P>
For the second of many times, first baseman Gehrig played every game. Second 
baseman Tony Lazzeri hit .309. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dugan was at third for the 1927 Yankees, with Mark Koenig at shortstop, as 
Pat Collins caught 92 games, Benny Bengough 31. 
</P>
<P>
Waite Hoyt was the ace of an old staff that put it together for one last season 
in 1927, which turned out to be the final year in the majors for Urban Shocker 
(18-3), Dutch Ruether (13-6) and Bob Shawkey (2-3). Shocker died at 38 a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast there was a rookie reliever, Wilcy Moore, who in his only big 
season in baseball had a 19-7 record with a 2.28 earned-run average in 50 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt, who began his 21-year career in the majors in 1918, led the league's 
starters with 22-7 and 2.63. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Pennock, the Knight of Kennett Square, who started his 22-year career in 
1912, finished 19-8. He was never to win that many again. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth came back to hit 54 home runs in 1928, when he and Gehrig led the league 
with 142 runs batted in apiece. That sort of reprise impresses Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
1939 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"Gehrig was still a force on the club when the Yankees started another streak 
under (Manager) Joe McCarthy, and this time they won pennants in 1932, '36, 
'37, '38, '39, '41, '42 and '43. That's four straight in the '30s and three 
straight in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"And in all those seasons, they lost only one World Series. The Cardinals beat 
them in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball had never seen such a dominant team. In the four World Series played 
from 1936 through 1939, the Yankees lost a total of only three games. They 
swept the Cubs in '38 and the Reds in '39." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through McCarthy's streak, the 1939 club was his best, in Patterson's 
view. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio led the league with a career-high .381 batting average in 1939, when a 
rookie outfielder, Charlie (King Kong) Keller, hit a career-high .324 and when 
the other outfielder, George Selkirk, hit .306. 
</P>
<P>
At third base, Red Rolfe had his biggest year, batting .329 and leading the 
league in runs, hits and doubles. Joe Gordon was at second, Frankie Crosetti at 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame catcher, Bill Dickey, hit .302. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ruffing (21-7) matched his peak season on a staff with four other pitchers 
who each won 12 or 13 games -- Atley Donald, Lefty Gomez, Bump Hadley and Monte 
Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
"The most poignant of baseball stories began one night in the spring of 1939 
when Joe McCarthy walked in to talk to the writers in the dining room of the 
Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us: 'I think I have a story for you fellows. Lou Gehrig has asked to 
come out of the lineup.' 
</P>
<P>
"Lou had played in 2130 consecutive games. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, nobody knew how ill he was, although we thought it was serious. 
When he carried the lineup card out to the plate that summer, he could hardly 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"This inspired the team. Even with Babe Dahlgren instead of Gehrig at first 
base, that became the greatest Yankee team of my time. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game at Detroit was typical. Guys were crying as they walked out to 
bat. That day they would have beaten any team that ever played. They beat 
Detroit, 22-2." 
</P>
<P>
1974 OAKLAND A's 
</P>
<P>
"These days you can no longer build a ballclub the way Charlie Finley built the 
1970s A's -- which was also the way the old Yankees were put together. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrewd scouting was the main thing it took. You didn't have to compete with 
other front offices in the draft. And you didn't have to worry about losing a 
superstar to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"So the 1974 A's were baseball's last great team. Except for the A's, there 
hasn't been a great one since the 1963 Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who did much of the scouting himself, helped round up a group that won 
a record five straight division championships for Oakland starting in 1971. The 
string only ended in 1976 when the entrepreneurial era ended in baseball as the 
draft and free agency took hold, balancing up the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The (1972-73-74) A's met the two tests for greatness we've been talking about. 
In successive years, they won more than one pennant, distancing themselves from 
the field. And they never disgraced themselves in the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
In fact they won pennants and three World Series in three consecutive years, in 
addition to winning five straight division titles. 
</P>
<P>
The 1974 A's, with Catfish Hunter pitching a league-leading 25 wins with a 
league-leading ERA, went on to blitz the Dodgers in a five-game Series. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, Ken Holtzman and John (Blue Moon) Odom won the last three straight that 
October, after which neither the A's nor baseball was ever the same. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pitchers' team that Finley built. Hunter averaged more than 22 wins in 
1972-73-74, while Holtzman averaged nearly 20. Vida Blue, after winning 24 as a 
rookie in 1971, slumped to 6-10 the next season after a long contract squabble 
with Finley, but came back to win 17 in 1973 and 20 in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Relief star Rollie Fingers appeared in a league-leading 76 games in 1974, and 
in three years averaged 20 saves. 
</P>
<P>
In all three years, there was only one .300 hitter, outfielder Joe Rudi, who 
got up there only once in an era when .318 could lead the league. 
</P>
<P>
The power came from Reggie Jackson, who averaged 29 home runs. Otherwise, 
Finley got a lot of mileage out of players such as Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, 
Gene Tenace, Dick Green and catcher Ray Fosse. 
</P>
<P>
The managers, who ran Finley's errands, were Dick Williams in 1972-73 and Alvin 
Dark in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
1951 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"In Casey Stengel's first five years as manager, the Yankees won five pennants 
and five straight World Series in 1949, '50, '51, '52 and '53. No one has ever 
done that before or since. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Casey came back in 1955, '56, '57, and '58 and won four more pennants -- 
that's nine in 10 years -- plus two more World Series in '56 and '58. Finally, 
after winning his 10th pennant, he lost the seventh game of the 1960 World 
Series when Bill Mazeroski hit that home run for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey, I feel, has been under-appreciated as a baseball man. He wasn't just 
the most colorful baseball character of the last 50 years, he lived the game 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This was appropriately recognized at his funeral service. I'll never forget 
that instead of 'Nearer My God to Thee,' they played 'Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame' all the way through Casey's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out of the chapel, it had been raining a bit, and there was a 
rainbow in the sky -- a colorful rainbow in L.A., mind you. One of the other 
pall bearers saw it at the same time I did and whispered, 'I see Casey's at it 
already.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of Stengel's seven world champions, Patterson's favorite was the 1951 team -- 
DiMaggio's last in the majors and Mickey Mantle's first. And in retrospect, 
Stengel's managing or his jesting, whatever, was at least as helpful as the 
contributions of his batsmen. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a .300 hitter in an outfield in which DiMaggio and Mantle both 
finished in the .260s. In fact, on a team with Yogi Berra catching and 
infielders such as Bobby Brown, Phil Rizzuto, and Johnny Mize, the only .300 
hitter was a rookie infielder, Gil McDougald. 
</P>
<P>
The club was carried by pitchers Ed Lopat (21-9), Vic Raschi (21-10), and the 
Superchief from Oklahoma, Allie Reynolds (17-8), who pitched two no-hitters 
that season -- inducing Ted Williams to loft a foul ball to Yogi Berra for the 
last out in the second one after Berra, on a three and two count, dropped 
Williams' first high foul. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1951 World Series, camaraderie or team spirit -- or Stengel -- may have 
been decisive, along with the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants won the first game after beating the Dodgers in the playoff on 
Bobby Thomson's home run. The Yankees won the second, and the third was 
supposed to be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day when Eddie Stanky kicked the ball out of Phil Rizzuto's 
glove, and the Giants went on to win, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"On the fourth day it rained, and the papers were full of Stanky's dropkick. 
The Yankees read and heard everything they could stand about that kick." 
</P>
<P>
When they came out for the fourth game, they came out in one group, like a 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, baseball players straggle out two or three at a time -- but not those 
Yankees. Not for that fourth game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all together when they came down the narrow stairway from the 
clubhouse way out (in center field), and together they walked all that long way 
in. That's the only time I ever saw that. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the writers and, I'm sure, some Giant fans looked at each other and 
said, 'It's all over.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was. In the last three games, the Yankees won three straight." 
</P>
<P>
The winning pitchers: Reynolds, Lopat and Raschi. 
</P>
<P>
1922 GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Stengel was a player in 1922, and a pretty good one, on one of (Manager) 
John McGraw's best teams when the New York Giants swept the Yankees in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants had won the Series the year before, and they (were to) win it again 
in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
"McGraw won four straight 1920s pennants but lost the 1924 World Series to the 
boy manager, Bucky Harris, when Walter Johnson pitched all 12 innings for the 
Washington Senators in the seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1922 Giants had come over in trades from Cincinnati, Philadelphia, 
Boston or other National League teams, either that year or a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Stengel, a left-handed outfielder who came from Philadelphia in 1921, led the 
1922 Giants with a career-high .368 batting average, though he only played in 
84 games. 
</P>
<P>
That was a season when every Giant starter hit .322 or better except third 
baseman Heine Groh, who trailed at .265. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Frank Snyder and third baseman Dave (Beauty) Bancroft joined Stengel 
with lifetime bests. The other infielders, Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch, the 
Fordham Flash, and George (Highpockets) Kelly, weren't far behind. Nor were the 
other outfielders, Irish Meusel, Bob's brother, and Ross Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching was hardly world class although Rosy Ryan (17-12) led the league 
with a 3.01 ERA. Steadier in the first World Series ever broadcast, Giant 
pitchers held Babe Ruth to a composite .118. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT FIVE 
</P>
<P>
1929 PHILADELPHIA A'S: Owner-Manager Connie Mack's best team, with five Hall of 
Famers including catcher Mickey Cochrane in his prime, won the World Series in 
1929 and 1930 from the Cubs and Cardinals, respectively, before losing to the 
Cardinals in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
On Mack's great 1929 club, which beat the Cubs in five games, left fielder Al 
Simmons hit .365 and led the league with 157 runs batted in. The other three 
Hall of Famers were pitcher Lefty Grove (20-6), and infielders Jimmie Foxx and 
Eddie Collins. 
</P>
<P>
1955 DODGERS: After losing five World Series to the Yankees in '41, '47, '49, 
'52, and '53, the Dodgers, then in Brooklyn, lost the first two games of the 
'55 Series. But they fought on, and, in Brooklyn's biggest day, finally won a 
seventh game from the Yankees as Johnny Podres pitched a 2-0 shutout. Jackie 
Robinson was at second base after playing three other positions as a regular in 
three previous World Series: first base, third and left field. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Roy Campanella became a three-time National League MVP as Gil Hodges, 
Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese and rookie pitcher Roger Craig, a Series winner, 
also helped make that team memorable. 
</P>
<P>
1963 DODGERS: Manager Walt Alston led the Dodgers to seven pennants in '55, 
'56, '59, '63, '65, '66 and '74 and to four World Series victories in '55, '59, 
'63 and '65. The '63 champions, who swept the Yankees in four games, were 
builder Walter O'Malley's favorite team. The catcher was Johnny Roseboro. The 
inspiration came from shortstop Maury Wills. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale pitched a 1-0 shutout in the '63 'Series, in which the Dodgers 
yielded but four runs in four games. Podres was a 4-1 winner. After Sandy 
Koufax won the first and fourth games, he was named MVP. "Why me?" he asked. "I 
gave up three of the four runs." 
</P>
<P>
1907 CHICAGO CUBS: Baseball's first great team, with Manager Frank Chance, the 
Peerless Leader, at first base, won consecutive pennants and two World Series 
in 1906-07-08. Pitcher Mordecai Peter Centennial (Three Finger) Brown was 26-6, 
20-6 and 29-9 in those three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On the 1907 team, a four-straight World Series winner, the answer to baseball's 
most enduring trivia question was Harry Steinfeldt. The question: Who played 
third base on the team that immortalized the double play with (Joe) Tinker to 
(Johnny) Evers to Chance? 
</P>
<P>
1916 BOSTON RED SOX: To win their second straight World Series, the Red Sox, 
managed by Bill Carrigan, needed a strong pitching performance in the second 
game -- which went 14 innings, still the Series record. Happily, they had a 
left-hander on their staff who could do it. 
</P>
<P>
He was Babe Ruth, who pitched all 14 innings. Ruth hit .272 in 1916, with three 
home runs. As a pitcher he was 23-12, the year before his career-high 24-13.

JIM MURRAY: OTHER HENDERSON STEALS THE SHOW

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The longest, eeriest, most schizoid, nervous World Series in the annals of 
baseball resumed Friday night. The Oakland A's were late arriving. Not as late 
as the Giants. They didn't show up till the ninth inning. In the immortal words 
of Joe Gould, they should of stood in bed. By the time they got there, the game 
and maybe the World Series was stolen. No team has ever come back from an 0-3 
deficit to win a World Series. No team has ever come back from 0-3 even to 
stretch the Series to six games. Only three of them have even come back to win 
the fifth game. Then, all went quietly. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever thought of Candlestick Park as a bandbox before. The Oakland A's 
turned it into a phone booth. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of phone booths, someone better check the one the center fielder of 
the Oakland A's steps into every October as the baseball version of the 
mild-mannered nice guy and comes out in a cape and block S and home runs bounce 
off him. 
</P>
<P>
Before the World Series started, the San Francisco Giants knew Henderson was a 
guy who was going to be a big problem for them. They loaded up on scouting 
reports on this guy. They knew he leads the world in stolen bases, he can hit 
home runs, he has 101 ways to beat you. He kept them up nights. When he walks 
up there, pitchers' palms sweat, the back of their neck hurts and they wish the 
manager would come out and yank them. 
</P>
<P>
Only, they had the wrong Henderson. Rickey is supposed to be doing all those 
terrible things to them, beating them five ways, rubbing their faces in it -- 
on his way to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
The other Henderson is kind of baseball's version of a high plains drifter. 
Sort of Have Bat, Will Travel. He has been around some of the major backwaters 
of baseball. Even Seattle gave up on him. He had a career as somebody's caddy 
-- the guy who goes in the late innings for the star or for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
He stole a base every other eclipse of the moon. He's miles behind Babe Ruth in 
lifetime homers. He was a fill-in, a throw-in in trades. He gets swapped for 
people like Randy Kutcher. He has to look down at the front of his uniform to 
see what town he's in. 
</P>
<P>
But, that's June and July. In October, Dave Henderson becomes the Sultan of 
Swat II. 
</P>
<P>
You will all remember the October he was a member of the Red Sox as a kind of 
afterthought in a deal where Boston got Spike Owen. The Red Sox gave up Rey 
Quinones for Owen, but for Henderson only the ever-familiar player-to-be-named. 
(Turned out to be someone named John Christensen.) 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were within one strike of the American League pennant that season 
when Dave Henderson came to bat in the playoffs at Anaheim. With a man on, he 
put a Donnie Moore fastball into the seats to wipe out a 5-4 lead for the 
Angels. In the 11th inning, he hit the fly ball that won the game -- and, to 
all intents and purposes, the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
In the World Series that year, he hit a 10th inning home run to help put the 
Red Sox ahead 5-3. It wasn't his fault they couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Candlestick Park, Dave Henderson came within an inch of hitting 
three home runs in one Series game. This is the kind of thing only the Babe 
Ruths and the Reggie Jacksons do. Henderson hit two indubitable home runs. The 
third one hit the top of the right-field fence and, when it bounced into the 
air, fell on the side of the field in play. 
</P>
<P>
He got three hits for 10 bases, scored two runs and drove in four. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson may be baseball's Mr. October, but he'd better spare a week for 
Mr. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
For a guy who wasn't even the right Henderson, he tore the Giants' pitching 
into little pieces Friday night. For a night, he made Rickey the Other 
Henderson. Rickey stole his 2 bases, scored his run, got his hit -- but the 
Henderson who wasn't Rickey did all that damage just standing there. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants realized who was doing them the injury. In the eighth inning, they 
paid him the ultimate baseball accolade. They hit him in the neck with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
All season long, Dave Henderson is the mild-mannered Clark Kent type. He hits 
his .270 or .250, catches everything hit to him and grins his way to another 
playoff and World Series. That's when he starts to leap tall buildings. That's 
when he becomes Super Dave. 
</P>
<P>
Part of his success is looseness. If Henderson were any more relaxed, he'd take 
the field sound asleep. When a Spanish language crew approached him before Game 
2, Henderson begged off. "I don't speak the language," he explained. "In fact, 
I don't speak my own too well." 
</P>
<P>
In any language, he's a Series hero. He's the right Henderson for these games, 
the two-run homer Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Home run Henderson cannot explain his autumnal heroics. "A time at bat is a 
simple thing to me," he grins. "Either, he gets you out -- or you hit him. I 
don't check the calendar, just the pitch." 
</P>
<P>
So, the curious World Series of 1989, the star-crossed classic, the Series 
nobody wanted, continued its haunted way to conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beleaguered Series, under unaccountable flack from many sources right 
up to the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
No one could figure out why. There was racing at Bay Meadows, a rodeo at the 
Cow Palace, crap games in the bars. Japanese tourists had the town pretty much 
to themselves, probably because they have a long tradition of living with 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The opera was playing Mozart, the San Francisco symphony was doing Tchaikovsky 
and Ravel, the strippers were out in force, you could see "Kill Me Again" or 
"Shocker" at select theaters and drive-ins. 
</P>
<P>
But the prevailing opinion seemed to be, Baseball had some nerve going on with 
its revels in the midst of this sad state of affairs. Baseball, like Presidents 
and vicars -- and Caesar's wife -- seemed to be held to a higher standard than 
the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
The presumption was, people would be tuning in to see it for the same reasons 
they flocked to train wrecks or four-alarm fires -- morbid curiousity. The game 
would be incidental. 
</P>
<P>
Well, all the damage was done to Candlestick's reputation, not its structure. 
Seven home runs rattled out of its premises Friday night -- two by the 
Henderson who wasn't Rickey, one by Jose Canseco, Carney Lansford, Tony 
Phillips, one by Matt Williams and one by somebody named Bill Bathe. It was 
Bill's sixth career big league homer. Bathe hit most of his homers in places 
like West Haven, Conn., and Clinton, Iowa, before Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The only people who could think of a good reason why the 1989 World Series 
should not be resumed today are the San Francisco Giants.

<TEXT>     Cal Levy, one of Pete's agents, was quoted as saying: "It's not a huge role
or anything, so they must have figured they didn't need a name actor to play
the part.";    Nice goin', Cal. Keep talking and next thing you know, they'll
be asking Pete to do the gig for free.;    Rose dumped Cobb's seemingly
untouchable career-hit record with No. 4,192 off Padres pitcher Eric Show in
September 1985. (Was it that long ago?);    The most notable thing he
accomplished after that was to get himself in a lot of trouble with both
baseball and the federal government. Make that two things.;    Which puts him
two up on Show.;  BACK-HANDED SALUTE FROM SNIPPY NORTH; When the A's Mike
Moore gave up 10 runs in three innings in an 11-6 loss to Cleveland last week,
that pushed Seattle past Oakland into first place in the A.L. West. Moore was
selected by Seattle as the top pick in the June 1981 draft but left the
Mariners as a free agent in 1988 to sign with the A's. So, wrote Jim Street of
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last week: "Mike Moore finally pitched the
Mariners into first place.";  HOCKEY GRABBING OUR HEARTS AND HEADLINES; 
Remember when hockey puck was a Don Rickles gag line? What happened? It's all
the Sharks' fault. All of a sudden we're talking seriously about guys who end
each sentence with "Eh?";    First we got an Elvis Presley impersonator
rockin' out with Pittsburgh Penguins player Phil Bourque (he's the one in the
Stanley Cup T-shirt). Then, talking about T-shirts, we learn that somewhere in
the greater Toronto area, there are a lot of puckheads wearing Sharks
T-shirts. The T-shirts are reported to be a hot item at a store in Toronto's
Eaton Centre, where a clerk said 17 have sold this month. And we're talking
devoted fans here, because the made-in-Canada T-shirts carry a $29.98

Peckham underwent surgery right there in Cooperstown, got a new artificial hip
and was scheduled to be released Thursday. But she didn't feel up to trekking

<LEADPARA>  Police in Pleasant Hill launched a big league effort to recover 16 priceless
autographed baseballs stolen from the home of Bill Hawe last month, and they
hit a home run when they cracked a teen burglary ring. "It's a pleasure," said
the 62-year-old Hawe, who began collecting signatures on baseballs when he was
about 5 years old. He thought he'd never see the collection -- including two
horsehides signed by Babe Ruth -- again after it was stolen in February. But
police recovered the balls when they unraveled a string of home burglaries
last week. Ten youths aged 16 and 17 burglarized seven homes in the area,
detective Dan Connelly said. One of the youngsters turned over the balls.
"They didn't realize what they had," Connelly said. "When they got outside and
they saw one that said Babe Ruth and they said, 'Holy moley.' " Hawe, who
didn't know the value of his collection until part of it was stolen, said
experts estimate it is worth more than $250,000.  </LEADPARA>

MELVIN DURSLAG: HITTING IMMORTALITY FOR A MAN NAMED FIELDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball in its time has survived its share of crises. It has survived a fixed 
World Series. It has survived an earthquake. It even has survived an announcer 
who used as his sign-off: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the old right-hander, rounding third and heading for home." 
</P>
<P>
The last, in particular, was painful, but baseball survived it. 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere of survival, it is surprising most of all that the home run 
standards of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris continue to survive through the changing 
times that have followed them. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth hit 60 homers in 1927. Maris hit 61 in 1961. All these years have passed 
-- and the achievement of neither has been matched, not Ruth's in a 154-game 
season, not Maris' in a 162-game season. 
</P>
<P>
And all the while, society has been bombarded with boasts of human advancement 
in sporting endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, for instance, a guy puts the shot a little under 76 feet. 
At the time Maris hits 61, guys are putting the shot maybe 65 feet. 
</P>
<P>
And when Ruth hits 60, they are muscling the shot 52 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But home run production for a single season? A bust. 
</P>
<P>
So now the argument begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know why someone hasn't caught Ruth or Maris?" a scholar asks. "Better 
pitching by guys helped by modern methods." 
</P>
<P>
"But if pitching has been improved by better coaching, better conditioning and 
better living habits," the pundit is asked, "why hasn't all this improved 
hitters, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Any case you want to make here on behalf of hitters isn't impressive, leading 
us to wonder today about batsmen named Cecil Fielder and Jose Canseco. Are they 
working up to something noteworthy, or are they teasing us in April and May? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder is an interesting study. Rising 6-feet-3, at 230 pounds, he experienced 
an undistinguished start in baseball, calling on such ports as Butte, Mont.; 
Florence, S.C.; Kinston, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn., before being given a brief 
showing in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he is in Syracuse, from where Toronto recalls him for another look. And 
do you know what it does then? It sells him to the Hanshin Tigers of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Doing well already on their purchase of Rockefeller Center, the Japanese make 
another score. Cecil Fielder smashes 38 home runs for Hanshin in 106 games. 
Folks in the town aim to elect him sheriff, if not lord mayor, but Detroit 
sneaks in and steals him as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are heading for Memorial Day, and Fielder has hit 17 home runs and 
Canseco has 18. 
</P>
<P>
A right-handed batter, Cecil hits home runs off right- and left-handed pitchers 
alike. And he hits a lot of bad pitches, which is what it takes to catch Ruth 
or Maris. 
</P>
<P>
You give a hitter the strike-zone eye of Ted Williams and he isn't going to 
swing often enough to punch out 60. 
</P>
<P>
A Detroit spokesman explains: "It is Cecil's position that any ball leaving the 
pitcher's hand has home run potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Does he hit screamers?" the man is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, mostly high flies. He does best on outside pitches on which he is able to 
extend his long arms." 
</P>
<P>
"Then why don't they pitch him inside?" the interrogator, a tactical genius, 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
"They did -- until he learned to pull the ball. Now if they pitch him inside, 
he is able to lift one past the left-field pole." 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Cecil doesn't pose as a student of technology, ascribing science to the 
art of belting homers. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of May 1961, Maris had hit 12 home runs. Ruth, in 1927, had hit 15. 
You come up with comparative timetables this early in the year and you usually 
go off a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But, you presume, it eventually will happen that someone will take the measure 
of Ruth and Maris, whose records have stood too long. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be Canseco? We see him as too nervous and too prone to injury. 
</P>
<P>
What about Fielder? He is too new for a judgment to be made, but he has wide 
experience at dispensing home runs in the Pioneer League, South Atlantic 
League, Southern League, Venezuelan Winter League and Japanese Central League. 
</P>
<P>
Has he recognized that pitching is better in the American League? Sparky 
Anderson doesn't think so. But if it is, Sparky pleads with you not to tell 
Cecil.

ALL-STAR TEAMS MAKE PITCH FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS

<P>
As the summer baseball and softball seasons wind down, several Glendale-area 
all-star teams are contending for titles. 
</P>
<P>
The La Crescenta Babe Ruth all-stars, made up of 13-year-olds, were scheduled 
to play Wednesday night in the Babe Ruth Western Regionals at Carson City. 
Results were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
La Crescenta advanced to the third round by defeating Reno, Nev., 7-4, and 
Arizona, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the regional advances to the Babe Ruth World Series at Jamestown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Entering this week, the Crescenta Valley Little League all-stars were still 
alive in the Division 2 tournament at Long Beach. The winner advances to the 
Western Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley defeated West Arcadia, Laguna and Woodland Hills en route to 
Tuesday night's winners'-bracket showdown with Cypress. Results of that game 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
In softball, Nancy Evans had 18 strikeouts as the Centennial League all-stars 
defeated Tucson (Ariz.), 3-0, Monday in the opening round of the 13-15-year-old 
Senior Division Western Regional at Pinole, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial, which finished second in the 1989 Senior World Series, will play 
Red Bluff, Calif., today in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10-12-year-old Major Division, Lindsay Parker struck out 13 and pitched 
her seventh consecutive no-hitter as the Liberty League all-stars defeated 
Albuquerque, 6-1, and advanced to the second-round. 
</P>
<P>
Life in the fast lane: Tom Kendall of La Canada won his third consecutive 
Trans-Am Series auto race July 29 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 23, collected $11,050 for the victory, averaging 105 m.p.h. over the 
40-lap course. The victory gives Kendall a 29-point lead over Darin Brassfield 
in the Trans-Am standings. 
</P>
<P>
Trading places: Distance runner Robert Nelson, who attended Pasadena City 
College last year, will transfer to Glendale College and James Moore, the 
Western State Conference 10,000-meter champion for Glendale (31 minutes 36.2 
seconds) this spring, will transfer to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Neither runner will be eligible during cross-country season. However, both 
could compete in track if the residency requirement of 12 units is completed 
during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson placed 10th in the Southern California junior college regional 
cross-country championships last season. Moore placed 17th at the Southern 
California regional cross-country championships and 21st at the state meet.

MIKE DOWNEY: TERRY CHANGED COURSE, BUT HE STILL KNOWS HOW TO PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ralph Terry realizes now that you do not always realize the magnitude of what 
you are doing, even while you are doing it. "You go through life real fast, and 
you really don't stop to see what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to play with Roger Maris when he hit 61 home runs. I got to play with 
Mickey Mantle, one of the greatest baseball players who ever lived. I got to 
play for Casey Stengel. I played on seven pennant winners, pitched in five 
World Series. I screwed one up and I won one. That's a lot to happen to one 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
"And now I'm out there playing golf with Arnold Palmer, and pretty soon Big 
Jack (Nicklaus) and Lee (Trevino) will be out there grabbin' some of the gravy, 
and I'll tell you what, it's such a nice feeling to watch these men play and 
not have to buy a ticket," Terry said. "I guess you could say I'm an ambassador 
from one sport to another. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor man's Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Terry, at 53 only five years older than Pete Rose, has been out of 
baseball since 1967. Today he finds himself on the Senior circuit -- no, not 
that baseball league in Florida, but the PGA Senior golf barnstorming troupe. 
Terry will be one of 72 competitors in this week's GTE West Classic at Ojai, 
along with Palmer, Billy Casper and dozens of other distinguished (one-sport) 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, nobody can ever say Terry hasn't spent his life playing with the best. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century ago, the poor man's Bo was pitching in his fifth consecutive 
World Series. Two years before, he won 23 times during the season and then 
twice more as Most Valuable Player of the 1962 Series. Seeing as how no New 
York Yankee right-hander had won so many games in one season since 1904, this 
made him a fairly famous fellow for an organization that had already given us 
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and the gentleman standing in center field, 
directly behind him, the Mick. 
</P>
<P>
Two years before that, Terry was the man on the mound when Bill Mazeroski of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates propelled into history a World Series homer every bit as 
dramatic as the ones by Carlton Fisk and Kirk Gibson that would follow in years 
to come. Terry much rather would have induced Maz to strike out -- after all, 
since he fanned 1,000 men in his major league lifetime, he definitely knew how. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Terry knew pressure, knew fame, knew hits and misses. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, he's the guy trying to hit the ball -- and there's nobody backing him 
up out there; no Ellie Howard, telling him what to do, or Mantle, chasing down 
his mistakes. Being out there by oneself, as during last year's three-way 
playoff for the final two exempt positions at the Senior tour's national 
qualifying tournament, can humble even a guy who knows what it is like to have 
50,000 customers in a grandstand and millions of television viewers staring 
bug-eyed as he grips a baseball in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
That golf playoff was "as tough as pitching the seventh game of the Series," 
said Terry, who should know. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remains winless on the tour, and last year never placed among the 
top 10 at any event, he does occasionally make appearances on the leader board. 
In August, Terry tied for 10th place at the Showdown Classic in Utah, his best 
finish yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I never fancied myself the next Ben Hogan or anything," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 22, a car wreck left the pitcher with a busted left hip. "I had to 
spend the whole winter in traction. It's lucky they didn't have to replace it," 
Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, when 1958's spring training rolled around, I still wasn't 100%. I played 
a little pepper, but couldn't do any running. So a couple of the coaches, who 
were avid golfers, said: 'You want some exercise? Go play golf.' And that 
intrigued me. I'd only been to the driving range, or played, you know, 
putt-putt. Bob Swift and Don Heffner told me to go rent a set of clubs and play 
this public course over in Haines City. 
</P>
<P>
"Before long, I had this nice little duck hook I was really proud of. And I 
stopped hitting grounders. I hate grounders. Some pitchers like 'em, but I hate 
grounders. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, Mickey was always out there playing, and we're both old Oklahoma boys, 
and he and Billy Martin and Tom Sturdevant always bet a lot of money, and they 
needed a fourth. So they started out giving me two shots on the (par) 5s. And 
we keep playing, day after day. And pretty soon I'm getting half a shot on the 
5s." 
</P>
<P>
Terry spent a dozen seasons in the baseball show before permanently changing 
cleats. He hasn't gotten rich from golf. From 1986-88, he earned $66,134 on the 
Senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The money they make in baseball now, oh, man," Terry said. "In '56, Mickey was 
the Triple Crown winner. The next year he batted .377. But Ted Williams batted 
something like .388. And Williams was about 40 then and couldn't run. If his 
legs were any good, he probably would have hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, George Weiss tried to cut Mickey $20,000 -- because he didn't win the 
league batting title. 
</P>
<P>
"Gabe Paul was that way in Cleveland. I roomed with Sam McDowell, when Sam 
struck out 325 men in 280 innings. That was the greatest strikeout percentage 
of all time, at least until Nolan Ryan came along. So I said, 'Sam, you are a 
star, man. You give 'em hell.' 
</P>
<P>
"He ain't in Gabe Paul's office 15 minutes before he comes out. 'What 
happened?' I asked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I didn't get nothing.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I felt the same way, especially when I won 25 games in one year. 
But, some things you do for money, and some things you don't. With golf, I'm 
just grateful they don't kick my butt off the course."

JIM MURRAY: ONE'S VANTAGE POINT AFFECTS BASEBALL LORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was Kirk Gibson's "Roy Hobbs" homer in the bottom of the ninth for the Dodgers 
in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series the Greatest Moment in Baseball History? 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Babe Ruth "calling his shot" in the '32 classic? Maybe it was Bobby 
Thomson's pennant-winning blow for the New York Giants in the '51 playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you like pitching. How about Johnny Vander Meer's back-to-back no-hitters 
for Cincinnati in '38? Don't wait up to see that again. 
</P>
<P>
They're having a banquet in New York Monday night to determine which of 20 
highlight moments in baseball is the game's all-time thriller. The credit card 
company, MasterCard, polled fans and sportswriters for a promotion in which the 
proceeds will go to combat ALS, the disease that cut short the life of Lou 
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion is all right so far as it goes. But it deals in happy moments, 
save for Gehrig's farewell ceremony at Yankee Stadium in '39. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you and I know baseball isn't all moonlight and roses, right? Baseball is 
suffering. Every home fan knows that. Consider the most famous piece of 
baseball literature of all time, "Casey at the Bat." Is that about the pitcher 
who struck him out? Is there one mention about the team that won? No, we are 
concerned here only with the fact there is no joy in Mudville. Never mind where 
there is joy. 
</P>
<P>
Take the game's anthem: "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." What's the key line? 
"If they don't win it's a shame." The guy who wrote that knew baseball. 
</P>
<P>
So, I wouldn't consider most of MasterCard's list as representative of the 
grand old game as you and I know it. I would prefer an alternate list. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
1. You say you saw Koufax pitch? Well, I saw Koufax bat. Never mind the four 
no-hitters, the strikeouts, the shutouts. The definitive memory I have of Sandy 
Koufax is in 1962 when he hit a home run off -- get this -- Warren Spahn! Now, 
Sandy was a lifetime .097 hitter with the Dodgers (he hit over .100 only once 
in his career, .177) and when he hit that home run, Spahnie chased him around 
the bases with cords standing out in his neck, calling Sandy every name he 
could think of (and, with Spahn, there were a lot of them). As Sandy rounded 
third that day, Milwaukee's Eddie Mathews growled, "You're making a sick joke 
out of this game!" A Koufax homer off Warren Spahn makes my highlight list 
hands down. 
</P>
<P>
2. You can talk of Carl Hubbell's five Hall of Famer strikeouts in an All-Star 
game, but how about Stan Williams walking in the 1962 pennant for the Giants? 
How about Manager Walt Alston ordering an intentional base on balls to the 
previous batter (Ed Bailey) to load the bases and set up the tragedy? The 
circumstances were these: The Dodgers carried a 4-2 lead into the final inning 
of the playoffs. As the disastrous inning unfolded, the Giants tied the score 
and had the bases loaded with two out when Williams walked Jim Davenport. Run 
up the pennant for San Francisco. The fateful inning saw the Dodgers 
contributing four bases on balls, an error and a wild pitch. The Giants got 
four runs -- and a pennant -- on two hits, including one in the infield.

3. You can home in on Bill Mazeroski's home run in the bottom of the ninth that 
won the 1960 World Series over the New York Yankees, if you like. But come with 
me to the eighth inning of that game. The Yankees were leading, 7-4, as 
Pittsburgh came to bat. Gino Cimoli singled to open the inning. Then came the 
routine double-play ball that probably decided the Series. It was what Joe 
Garagiola would describe as "a room-service double play." Except that the ball, 
off the bat of Bill Virdon, hit the infamous surface of Forbes Field's infield, 
known throughout the National League as "the coal mine." It bounced off an 
outcropping of anthracite, came up and hit Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the 
throat. It almost cost him his voice. It cost his team the World Series. A 
short time later, a backup catcher, Hal Smith, hit a home run with two on to 
put the Pirates ahead, 9-7. He never would have gotten to bat if the ball to 
Kubek hadn't found a rock. Mazeroski's homer in the ninth would have been 
merely interesting. 
</P>
<P>
4. Some people gave some consideration to the comeback of the New York Mets in 
Game 6 of the 1986 World Series as the definitive one, and that would make our 
pantheon, too, because of the ball that trickled through Red Sox first baseman 
Bill Buckner's legs. But our vote would have gone to the 10-run seventh inning 
posted by the Philadelphia Athletics over the Chicago Cubs at Philadelphia in 
1929. Not for the comeback, for the collapse. The Cubs had an 8-0 lead at the 
time. What mades this collapse memorable was that the Chicago center fielder, 
Hack Wilson, misjudged two fly balls in the inning. One of them went for an 
inside-the-park home run and scored three runs before he could run it down. 
Now, Slugger Hack was as famous for rum as runs. With runs, he either drove 
them in -- or let them in. In this inning, he let in five runs. Years later, 
teammate Pat Malone put the right note on it: "Hack did all right for a guy who 
saw three balls." 
</P>
<P>
5. One of the early eliminations in the balloting (62 moments were originally 
cited, then culled to 20) was a relief-pitching stint of 17 innings by Ed 
Rommel of the Athletics in 1932. It was not exactly Goose Gossage stuff. Eddie 
gave up 29 hits (and 14 runs) in that stint. He gave up eight hits to one 
batter alone, Cleveland shortstop Johnny Burnett, who set a major league record 
of nine hits in a game that day. That's one game I wish I'd seen. 
</P>
<P>
6. You can cite Nolan Ryan's five no-hitters, Koufax's four or Vander Meer's 
two straight, but let's have a moment of silence for Harvey Haddix, who pitched 
the longest no-hitter in baseball history. And lost. He pitched a perfect game 
for 12 innings for Pittsburgh against Milwaukee in 1959. His opponent, Lew 
Burdette, had a 12-hitter. Haddix lost the perfect game to an error and the 
no-hitter (and the game) to a home run in the bottom of the 13th. Actually, he 
almost didn't lose the game. When Joe Adcock hit the bottom-of-the-13th home 
run, there was one out and teammates Henry Aaron and Felix Mantilla on first 
and second. When the home run cleared the fence, Aaron cut for the dugout at 
second base instead of continuing on to the plate. Adcock was declared out for 
passing him. Mantilla was called back on the field to score. Had there been two 
out, the game might have gone on. The final score went into the record book as 
1-0. Haddix lost his no-hitter, Adcock lost his home run and baseball lost a 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
You see, baseball is not all ticker-tape parades to City Hall. Baseball is 
about losing. The poet, Aeneas, wrote about "the sense of tears in mortal 
things." Baseball fans know where he's coming from. You're not a fan till your 
favorite pitcher walks in the winning run, your favorite hitter pops up with 
the bases loaded, your favorite team blows an 8-0 lead in the eighth inning. 
That's when baseball finds out who its friends are. Those are the real 
highlights. The might-have-beens.

American Football (which, oddly enough, put a team in Sacramento).;    The guy
gesturing at him is Kay Stephenson, coach of the Sacramento Surge.;    Surge?
That name is almost as bad as Kay.;     NOLAN CHOWS DOWN WITH BUSH AND THEM;
Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan and his wife, Ruth, were guests of George
Bush, another Texas home boy, at a little gathering the other night up there
at the White House, or as they call it down in Harlingen: La Casa Blanca.;   
"I was nervous when I found out Nolan and I were going to be sitting at
separate tables," Ruth said. "But I was sitting between Walter Cronkite and
Secretary of State James Baker, and they both have Texas backgrounds, so it
was really nice.";    Ryan found himself himself seated at the head table with
the president and Queen Margrethe II, the queen of Denmark.;    "It was
boy-girl, boy-girl," Ryan explained. "The queen, the president, Colin Powell's
wife, Alma, me and Katherine Couric of the Today Show.";    Ryan said he and
the queen didn't talk much baseball.;    "She probably knew less about me than
I did her, and I didn't know a whole lot about her.";  TEARDROPS ARE FALLING
TODAY IN COOPERSTOWN; When you think of home-run hitters, you probably think
of Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Roger Maris. (Some of us think of Wally Moon, but
that is another story.);    Ruth and Aaron and are in the Hall of Fame. Maris,
who broke Ruth's seemingly unbreakable record when he hit 61 homers in 1961,
is not. Again. And won't be.;    Why not? A new Hall of Fame rule: If a
player's career began after 1945, he must have received 60 percent of the vote
in at least one of his 15 years on the baseball writers association ballot or
be excluded from future consideration.;    Among those the rule knocked off
the board: Richie Ashburn (sorry about that, Richie), Harvey Kuenn (poor Harv)
and Maris.;    Maris, like Kuenn, is dead, so he doesn't care about it one way
or the other.;    But for those of us who hung on every pitch those last weeks
and then days of the 1961 season, barring Maris from even being considered for
Cooperstown anymore hurts.;    Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays got
there for excellence over a career, but Maris can be compared to the first man
to break four minutes in the mile -- or walk on the moon. He was a moment in
time, a bright moment in the history of baseball, a moment, we could add
snippily, that no one else has matched.;    No one in the Hall of Fame ever
hit 61 homers in one season. Roger Maris did.;    So, along with Ashburn and
Kuenn, Roger will have to wander out there as only a memory in our field of
dreams.;    Still eligible for consideration: guys such as Nellie Fox, Leo
Durocher and Phil Rizzuto.;    But not Roger.;    It's a shame.;  ' If I would
have thought about it longer, I would have said they reminded me of something
I used to walk behind when I plowed the fields.  That would have made everyone
think.  'Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins, who called game officials "jackasses."  </TEXT>

   George Bush, former baseball coach, took time
out Friday from preparing for his trip to communist Europe to talk
baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams,'' he said to the kids.
   They were gathered on the South Lawn, decked out in uniforms
identifying them as Indians, Mets, Springfield, Rocco's Rockettes,
and Parkland Blue Jays.
   The purpose was to mark the founding of Little League 50 years
ago in Williamsport, Pa. Adding luster to the ceremony were such
baseball greats as Stan Musial, Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson, Gary
Carter, Ted Sizemore, Joe Morgan and Jim Palmer.
   The president confessed his baseball hero was Lou Gehrig. And he
recalled that when Babe Ruth presented his papers to Yale, the Yalie
who accepted them was none other than George Bush.
   To the young players, Bush repeated a line that Babe Ruth
delivered to a crowd in Yankee Stadium when he was dying of cancer:
   ``You know, the only real game in the world, I think, is
baseball. You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7
years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on
top.''
   With those words, said the president, Ruth ``defined why Little
League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international
institution.
   ``My four boys played it, I coached it, and Barbara _ not many
non baseball players could properly score a baseball games, but
Barbara did that, inning after inning,'' Bush said.
   ``Like you, I know what makes Little League so special. It's a
feeling of sportsmanship, generosity, teamwork, a feeling of family,
fathers and daughters, mothers and sons.''
   He said in the 50 years, 20 million youngsters had played Little
League _ more than 2.5 million in 33 nations this year alone.
   Bush told the crowd that when he is in Poland next week, he will
have the pleasure of helping import Little League. And he said he
will tell about Musial and Carl Yastrzemski, both baseball greats of
Polish extraction.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams and ask these kids about it,'' Bush said. ``Dreams
are the essence of America and of baseball and Little League can
propel those dreams.
   ``In the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well
as off the field. That's where Little league really connects, by
building courage and character. It belts a grandslam home run by
doing those two things.''

<LEADPARA>  In the last couple of seasons, Mark McGwire has changed his contacts, his
approach, his attitude, anything anybody thought might help.;    But McGwire
hasn't been able to hitch up his batting average to a number he wouldn't be
embarrassed to see next to his name on a scoreboard.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ON AVERAGE, MCGWIRE STILL HAS WORK TO DO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  INJURY BUG: A's pitcher Eric Show is scratched from his scheduled start. Page
4D  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     McGwire could still hold his head up after he hit .231 in 1989. After all,
33 homers and 95 RBIs were nothing to be ashamed about. But then, he followed
that up with a .235 average in 1990. And even 39 homers, 108 RBIs and a Gold
Glove for his defensive work at first base didn't divert attention from
McGwire's average.;    Four seasons into his career, it's certain McGwire will
go down as a prodigious home-run hitter. But there's also the possibility that
he'll become known as a Dave Kingman type, a slugger who couldn't hit for
average. And then, there's the question of whether it really matters if Mark
McGwire hits .235 for the rest of his career, as long as he keeps crushing
homers and collecting 100-RBI seasons.;    While he's working with renewed
purpose again this spring to improve his average, McGwire insists that it
really isn't significant.;    "I don't think it does matter. It really
doesn't. If I played on another ballclub, I don't think it'd matter one bit,"
he said. "But because of the team I play on and because we're in the public
eye so much, something has to be written about me.;    "The only thing they've
talked about is my batting average. There might be one mention about my first
year. You know, I've set a few records that might or might not be broken. But
if you really look at it, I don't know if that many people know that.";   
Right now, McGwire is keeping better company than Kingman in baseball record
books. He demolished the rookie record with 49 homers in 1987; he became the
first player to reach 30 homers in each of his first four full seasons in
1990. His home-run ratio of one per 13.9 at-bats is second in history to Babe
Ruth's 11.8. Babe Ruth.;    And thanks to the .289 McGwire hit as a rookie and
his .260 average in 1988, his lifetime average isn't shabby at .253. Harmon
Killebrew took 573 homers and a .256 average into the Hall of Fame. But
Kingman finished with 442 homers and a .236 average, and there's some doubt
about how he'll be received by Hall of Fame voters.;    "I think he has the
capabilities of hitting for a higher average than he has the last two years.
It has nothing to do with ability. He has all the ability in the world," says
new A's hitting coach Rick Burleson. "I honestly believe that if he continues
with his approach the way it's been going the last couple of seasons, he'll
still put productive numbers up. But he might not hit again for the average
that the A's would like to see and that Mark McGwire would like to see.";   
In a lot of ways, McGwire still has to live with 1987 and probably will for
the rest of his career.;    "I think (1990) was a pretty good year. I think
pretty much my last three years have been pretty good years, but they've been
overshadowed because of '87, they've been overshadowed because of the players
we've had on our team," McGwire said. "It's going to be like that for Cecil
Fielder. He's going to live with it from now on. 'Can you ever hit 51 (homers)
again?' Chances are really not that good, because it doesn't happen that
often.;    "It's funny. I don't ever regret it. But sometimes, I wish I just
had a pretty good year instead of the great year that I did have.";    Over
the last four seasons, pitchers have adjusted their approach to McGwire. And
McGwire himself changed. When his stroke is right, he uses more of the field.
But he has become a dead-pull hitter. According to the Elias Baseball Analyst,
43 percent of the balls McGwire hit to the outfield last season went to left.
McGwire and Gary Gaetti had the fewest hits to the opposite field (11) of
American League players with 100 or more hits.;    It makes a certain sense,
says A's coach Reggie Jackson, who knows a little something about power
hitting.;    "He's gotten home run conscious. When you're successful -- and
success in the game today is winning and making money -- it's real hard to say
you're not doing the right thing when your team has been in the World Series
three years in a row, you've led the league in home runs and you're making $3
million a year," Jackson said. "We've got to get him to have success out there
(in center and right), because he's making a real good living hitting the ball
to left field.;    "He's forgotten about hitting the ball away from him. And
the reason he's been able to do that is because he has tremendous success
hitting the ball out of the ballpark. He's not covering the outside part of
the plate.";    McGwire has a good concept about the strike zone. He walked
110 times and struck out 116 in 1990. His on-base percentage was .370. For
comparison's sake, Willie McGee, who won the National League batting title
with a .335 average, had a .373 on-base percentage playing for the St. Louis
Cardinals and the A's last season.;    And A's Manager Tony La Russa knows
there could be a fine line between improving McGwire's average and
overemphasizing its importance.;    "You've got to keep things in perspective.
What's of highest significance is his production. You don't want to do
anything to take away from that, become too batting average conscious," La
Russa said. "But you don't want to be careless with at-bats.";    Burleson is
convinced that if McGwire buys this approach -- and McGwire says it is a
return to old ways for him -- he won't be a .230 hitter.;    "It's a slow
process. You don't go to a player of his stature, his ability, the things that
he's done in the game his first four years, and say you have to do this. You
have to take it one step at a time," Burleson said.;  MAKING HIS HITS COUNT;

<HEAD>Court: Ruth's Heirs Cannot Sue Publisher For Trademark
Infringement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babe Ruth's daughters struck out in federal
court when an appeals court ruled that a publisher did not infringe
on their trademark by using pictures of the Bambino in a calendar.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a
lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by Julia Ruth Stevens
and Dorothy Ruth Pirone, who has since died, and against Macmillan
Inc.
   After Ruth's death, the sisters registered the words ``Babe
Ruth'' as a trademark for playing cards and other uses.
   The court said the trademark did not apply to photographs of
Ruth.
   The calendar, ``The 1988 Macmillan Baseball Engagement
Calendar,'' contained three references to Ruth. The cover was a
photograph of Ruth helping a boy with his batting grip; a week in
October was illustrated with a picture of Ruth saluting General
John Pershing; and a page in the December section had a photograph
of a baseball autographed by Ruth.

JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Hello 1989, I thought you'd never get here. 
</P>
<P>
1988? I thought you'd never leave. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were: 
</P>
<P>
1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly 
than at the very hour of achieving his life's ambition? When it all falls to 
ashes just after all one's dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet, 
when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just 
come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it's all been a mistake. Ben 
had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified 
himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab 
coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he 
became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more 
than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter 
with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the 
infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way? 
That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you're looking 
at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters. 
You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will 
become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on 
your opponents' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play? 
Right! You kick a field goal. A losers' play. You go for the tie. You strike 
your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It's what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in 
last year's Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to "Winning isn't 
everything, it's the only thing?" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight? 
Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody 
Hayes would hit somebody. 
</P>
<P>
4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series 
for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known 
as "Dr.K," who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the 
season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The 
opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has 
already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson 
doesn't start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets 
manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn't save Gooden 
anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the 
other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey 
Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every 
second-guesser east of the Tehachapis. 
</P>
<P>
5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the 
American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of 
having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of 
the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series 
game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first 
two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need 
an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter 
who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2 
home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2 
times at-bat).

This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if 
he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the 
tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who's coming up 
to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He 
winces just lifting the bat. He's only going to tap the ball into play some 
place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he'll get in the whole 
Series and he doesn't look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick 
strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch. 
The chances are good he couldn't get around on a medium-good fastball if you 
sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the 
gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a "backdoor slider" on 
him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was 
going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the 
pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth's home-run record. 
</P>
<P>
It has been variously described as the "nickel curve," the "downtown pitch," 
and, when it doesn't work, as "the slop slider." This one you let go of is all 
three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can't believe his good luck. His eyes get big, 
his groin doesn't hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe 
Garagiola would say, "you couldn't order a better one from room service." 
Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped 
green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the 
historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes, 
the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after 
and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake. 
Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a 
Series-loser. They don't get any worse than that.

   Dorothy Ruth Pirone, the daughter of
baseball great Babe Ruth, died at home Thursday. She was 68 years
old.
   Pirone lived in Durham for more than a dozen years, where she
raised Arabian horses.
   For most of her life, Pirone was led to believe that her mother
was Ruth's first wife, Helen, despite rumors to the contrary in the
press.
   In 1980, however, she learned that her real mother was a woman
she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.
Pirone said last year she held no bitterness toward her father for
not revealing her true mother's identity.
   Last year, Pirone wrote a book about her famous father, ``My
Dad, the Babe.'' It was co-authored by Chris Martens and published
on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, Aug. 16, 1988.
   ``I think I did it more for myself and to show my father was not
the kind of person he was portrayed. I was very defensive of my
father and I can't help it,'' she said in an interview last year.
   Pirone died of natural causes, the family said through a
spokesman at the B.C. Bailey Funeral Home Inc., in Wallingford.
   Pirone, wife of the late Dominick L. Pirone, is survived by four
daughters, one son and 12 grandchildren.

Talk show host Larry King is asking fans "to go to bat for the Babe" in a fund 
drive to expand the Babe Ruth Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"These are exciting times for baseball fans. Starting today we're going to 
offer fans across the country membership to the Babe Ruth Museum," King said 
Tuesday behind the house where the Sultan of Swat was born 95 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can count on all of you to go to bat for the Babe." 
</P>
<P>
The museum hopes a broadened membership will pay for a 12,000-square-foot 
addition, including a 6,000-square-foot auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was built in 1974 around the birthplace of George Herman (Babe)

<LEADPARA>  Giants fans will remember Leo Durocher as the manager of the 1954 World Series
champions -- the last time the team truly finished first.;   But Durocher, who
died Monday in Palm Springs, will be even better remembered for his philosophy
that "Nice guys finish last."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BASEBALL LEGEND DUROCHER DIES
SCRAPPY EX-SHORTSTOP MANAGED GIANTS TO 1951, 1954
PENNANTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News staff writers John Akers and Colin Seymour contributed to this
report.; Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "He's like a turkey in a tobacco patch that sees a worm," the late Branch
Rickey told Sports Illustrated, "and knocks down every stalk to get it . . .
";   Durocher was loud, profane and, when he wanted to be, charming. He was
the first of the celebrity managers, and he traveled with other celebrities.; 
 "Leo was my idol," Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tom Lasorda said Monday after
learning Durocher, 86, had died of natural causes in Palm Springs. "I took his
number (2) because of the love, admiration and respect I had for him.";  
Durocher roomed with actor George Raft, was married three times, including
once to actress Laraine Day, and ran around with Frank Sinatra. His
relationship with Raft was a factor in Durocher's one-year suspension from
baseball in 1947. Durocher always claimed that Commissioner Happy Chandler
banished him without cause, and there was no evidence to indicate otherwise.; 
 Hank Sauer, the Chicago Cubs slugger of the 1940s and early 1950s who often
found Durocher infuriating as an opponent but equally charming as a companion,
said Durocher was ever-feisty in old age. "He was no different in golf," Sauer
said. "He would do everything in the world to win $10 from you. Then he'd buy
dinner for $50.";   Durocher played 12 full seasons and parts of four others
in the major leagues. His big league career officially began in 1928, when he
was among Babe Ruth's teammates with the New York Yankees. He also was a
member of the 1934 St. Louis Cardinals, the Gas House Gang. He was a superior
shortstop but an average hitter with a .247 lifetime average.;   He gained
greater prominence during his 25-year managerial career. Three of his teams
won pennants and one -- those 1954 New York Giants who swept the favored
Cleveland Indians -- a world championship.;   Five of his 1950 Giants -- Eddie
Stanky, Alvin Dark, Whitey Lockman, Wes Westrum and Bill Rigney -- became
managers.;   "He could take a club destined to finish in the second division,
and he'd lose interest," Rigney said. "But give him a chance to run for the
roses, and he'd give everything he had.;   "One-third of the club would be
scared to death of him. One-third weren't sure. And then there was the
one-third who knew him and understood him.";   His first year of managing was
1939, when he also played 116 games at shortstop for Brooklyn. His 1941
Dodgers won the pennant.;   It was while managing the Dodgers that Durocher
said, "Nice guys finish last." He said it of Mel Ott, never dreaming that in
1948, the year he returned from his year's suspension for associating with
"unsavory" people, he would replace Ott as Giants manager.;   In 1951, his
Giants made what is still regarded as the most dramatic comeback in baseball
history, overhauling the Dodgers after being 13 1/2 games behind in August.
That also was the year Willie Mays entered the majors.;   "It was like a
father-son involvement," Mays said. "When I came to Leo in '51, I was very
shy. The people in Minneapolis had built me up, and I must have been very
scared.;   "When I didn't hit when I first came up, he said to me that I was
his center fielder as long as he was here. He gave me the confidence, saying
hey, they're no different here.";   Three years later, with Mays in his first
full season after military duty, the Giants repeated as league champions and
dismantled the Indians in the World Series.;   In 1955, Durocher abruptly quit
the Giants and joined NBC. He remained out of baseball for five years,
returning in 1961 as a coach with the Los Angeles Dodgers.;   In 1966,
Durocher was named to manage the Chicago Cubs, turning them into pennant
contenders in the late 1960s.;   His last managerial job in the majors was
with Houston, in 1973. Claiming he couldn't relate to the modern player,
Durocher retired after the 1973 season.;   Mays and Durocher remained friends.
They owned houses near each other in Palm Springs, and they performed in four
or five card shows a year. One recurrent conversation was the Hall of Fame
Committee's snub of Durocher.;   "I think he was living for that," Mays said.
"He said to me many times that he'd just wished they'd say, 'Leo, you're in.'
";   Durocher told a close friend two weeks ago that he had instructed his
lawyer to refuse his induction if he were chosen posthumously.;   "It was the
one thing that bothered Leo right to the end," said Buzzie Bavasi, the
longtime baseball executive who went to work in the Dodgers organization in
1938.;   "He didn't want to go in (to the Hall) after he died," Bavasi said
Monday. "He told me just two weeks ago that he'd instructed his lawyer not to
accept it if they put him in after he was gone. He was so mad at the world.;  
"I think he said it in a fit of anger. I can't believe he meant it, but he
said it.";   Former Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale said, "He belongs in the Hall
of Fame, but if he ever gets into the Hall it will be like so many other
deserving people . . . it always seems they get in after they die.";

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: 'I Had a Hammer' reflects too closely Henry Aaron's private,
persistent personality.  </CAPTION>
<LEADPARA>  I HAD A HAMMER: The Hank Aaron Story; By Hank Aaron with Lonnie Wheeler  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Arts &amp; Books  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A SUBTLE SLUGGER WHO MADE HISTORY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books
Hutchins, a sports and news broadcaster and public speaker in the Bay Area for
17 years, is the anchor of "News at Ten" on KICU-TV, Channel 36 in San Jose.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  HarperCollins, 333 pp., $21.95; IN HIS introduction to "I Had a Hammer,"
co-author Lonnie Wheeler admits that other writers warned him about trying to
do Aaron's life because the baseball superstar has never had much to say.
Wheeler went ahead in the belief that "no life of such accomplishment and
eloquence could fail to produce a book of importance." Wheeler was right, but
he has written a book that manages to convey the accomplishment only
adequately.;    The accomplishments are inescapable. Aaron's career spanned
and illustrated significant changes in the game and society. As Wheeler
writes, "The man played in the major leagues from Williams to Yount, from
Kiner to Schmidt, from Eisenhower and Khrushchev to Carter and Khomeini, from
Hemingway and Steinbeck to Woodward and Bernstein; from James Dean to Jack
Nicholson, Elvis to Elton John, Nat Cole to Natalie, and Sugar Ray to Sugar
Ray, from Jackie Robinson to Jackie Onassis; from the fifteen-cent hamburger
to the fifteen-cent stamp; from the four-minute mile to the four-minute
dinner." Yet it remains news to even serious baseball fans that Henry Aaron is
the best hitter in professional baseball history, not Pete Rose, Ted Williams,
Willie Mays or Joe DiMaggio. The one-time crosshand-hitting, skinny shortstop
in the Negro American League hit his way through history, into history. His
dramatic assault on Babe Ruth's all-time home run record forced baseball and
America to confront their racism and hypocrisy.;    Unfortunately, Aaron's
personality is too clearly reflected in the tone of the book. Henry Aaron is
an intense, private, persistent personality. A teammate describes him as
totally in control of his emotions. He only appeared so, but because he
appeared so, Henry Aaron's monumental baseball career is nearly always
underestimated. Even though he understood why he was overlooked, Henry Aaron
just hit. "Because I was black, and because I never moved faster than I had
to, and because I didn't speak Ivy League English, I came into the league with
an image of a backward country kid who could swing a bat and was lucky he
didn't have to think too much." That overlooked, smart-as-a-fox country boy
ignored the slights and quietly stayed atop a very tough profession for 23
years, had 3,771 hits (that's a lot), 755 home runs (that's the most) and most
amazingly 6,856 total bases (more than 700 bases beyond the next player). He
was also a defensive star, base-stealer and model citizen and teammate.;   
The irony of Henry Aaron's life is that his black and poor beginnings in the
Deep South empowered him with the ability to be invisible necessary to succeed
in a hostile culture, but at the same time created a style unable to draw
attention to his accomplishments. Where Willie Mays did everything with such
verve that he demanded our eye, Aaron just hit. Day after day, in the face of
beanballs and death threats, sliders and slurs, in sickness and in pain, he
hit. That is the greatness in this book, but I'm not sure enough people will
appreciate it. Our culture seems to prefer flash, peak experience, charisma,
and under-appreciate the efficient secretary, committed relationship or
under-successful old friend.;    Although the book's stated purpose is to
carry on the cause of Jackie Robinson, the man who integrated baseball, and be
a reminder of the ordeal demanded of a man of color in a racist society, there
is little new here. "Our mission -- and that's the only thing to call it --
was to do something with the chance we had." Still, "I Had a Hammer" adds to
the details that can be filed under American Racism, Sports, Aaron. I was
surprised to learn that baseballs pitched to Aaron as he neared the home run
record were stamped with infrared numbers, so authenticity of the souvenirs
could be assured; that Aaron's first major league game was the first where
fielders were not allowed to leave their gloves on the field when they came to
bat; that the National League dominance in the All-Star game was racially
motivated; that Babe Ruth was often called "nigger" because of his broad-nosed
features.;    The book is, like Aaron, persistent and plodding. The
straightforward narrative, the gentle telling of stories, the simple repeated
themes provide only shadows of the man. Aaron's presence is felt, if not seen,
towering over the writing.;    In keeping the focus on the racial aspects of
Henry Aaron's life, I'm afraid the authors have missed some of the eloquence.
Aaron's life is not just that of a black man in a racist society; his success
is more universal. The challenges he faced were more common. So when Aaron
reaches the realization of his quest, the reader should feel a part of it.
Instead Aaron gropes for the words. "I knew what the past twenty-five years of
my life had been all about. I had done something that nobody else in the world
had ever done, and with it came a feeling that nobody else has ever had -- not
exactly, anyway. I didn't feel a wild sense of joy. I didn't feel like
celebrating. But I probably felt closer to God at that moment than at any
other in my life. I felt a deep sense of gratitude and a wonderful surge of
liberation all at the same time. I also felt a stream of tears running down my
face.";     Aaron took the thing he loved to do, the circumstances he faced
and his desire for dignity -- and made history. It is every person's
challenge. In this book it seems it is only a challenge to be black and play
baseball, or to be Southern and get respect. If I had a hammer, that's the
pointed message I'd like to see pounded into this book. (box)  </TEXT>

JIM MURRAY: SQUEEZED PLAY ENSURES HIS PLACE IN HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, never mind say-it-ain't-so. It's so. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose got an intentional base on balls. 
</P>
<P>
Or did he bunt? 
</P>
<P>
Bart Giamatti pitched around him. Put him on, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
It looks from the sidelines like the legal equivalent of both sides falling on 
the ball till the clock runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is saved. Pete Rose's niche in the Hall of Fame is secure because he 
didn't admit anything. In courtroom parlance, he pleaded nolo contendere. 
</P>
<P>
Pete says he gave himself up for the good of the team. Sort of like hitting 
behind the runner. His troubles were distracting attention from the great game 
of baseball, he explains. He was overshadowing the All-Star game, the pennant 
races. He didn't want it to extend over into the playoffs and World Series. 
Pete took himself out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Giamatti just wanted to get the matter out of the courts. 
Baseball fears the courts the way safecrackers do. And for somewhat the same 
reasons. It is operating outside the law and knows it. Giamatti well knows it 
takes years to convict serial killers through American jurisprudence. Appeals 
take longer. In this country, a man is presumed innocent even after he's been 
proved guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing a living legend, the man who got the most hits in baseball history, 
through the courts would have been like pursuing little Liza over the ice in 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
</P>
<P>
Is the integrity of baseball preserved? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that depends on what integrity you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
The integrity that prompts an outfielder who traps a ball to hold it up in 
triumph to deceive the umpire into thinking it was a legal catch? 
</P>
<P>
The integrity of the pitcher who scuffs up or spits on a ball, or the hitter 
who corks the bat? 
</P>
<P>
The catcher who shifts an outside pitch to fool the umpire into thinking it was 
a strike? 
</P>
<P>
The groundskeeper who wets down the basepaths or lets the infield grass grow to 
slow down a faster team or foil a harder-hitting team? 
</P>
<P>
So what has happened here? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it would appear that Pete Rose has been banned for life -- or one year. 
Whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
What does this do to his eligibility for the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Pete appears to have thought of that. By making it a condition of the 
compromise that he not have to make a clear admission of guilt, he maintains 
the fiction that he is throwing himself into a volcano -- or on a grenade -- 
for the good of the game. He's a team player. Injured innocence plays well in 
the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone else banned from baseball for life was banned for fixing games, 
not betting on them. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is not Shoeless Joe Jackson. What Pete did is against the rules. What 
Jackson did was against the law. Pete made a mistake. Jackson committed a 
felony. Pete bet -- if indeed he did -- on his own team. Jackson bet on the 
other team. In a World Series. One guy is a crook, the other just dumb. 
</P>
<P>
To get into the Hall of Fame, a player must pass a six-man screening committee 
and get 75% of the baseball writers' votes, around 400. Rose, of course, would 
have gone in by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
But what if he's still under suspension in 1992, when he becomes eligible for 
the Hall? The critical paragraph in the rules for election reads: "Candidates 
shall be chosen on the basis of playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, 
character, their contribution to the team or teams on which they played and to 
baseball in general." 
</P>
<P>
Is that Pete? 
</P>
<P>
Well, look, Babe Ruth is in the Hall of Fame, right? Everybody loves the Babe, 
but he wasn't Frank Merriwell, now, was he? He had character flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Ty Cobb, if you can believe what you read, was all character flaw. Grover 
Cleveland Alexander had troubles. Don't forget, Prohibition was the law of the 
land in their days. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball makes a crime of an activity that is not only legal in some states but 
is even run by some states. 
</P>
<P>
You can't fire the president of General Motors for betting on baseball games. 
In fact, you can't fire the President of the United States for it. I'm not even 
sure you can fire the president of the Cincinnati Reds. But you can fire the 
manager. Bart Giamatti did. 
</P>
<P>
A. Bartlett Giamatti is a tough guy. Don't let the button-down collar and the 
Ivy League background fool you. He won't cop out to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rose) has stained the game and must pay the consequences," Giamatti says 
coldly. "He has violated Rule 21 by betting on his own team." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is not used to people blocking the plate on him like that. He usually 
knocks them into the first row of seats. But Giamatti makes the tag. The 
agreement with Rose is what's on the table, not under it, he claims. 
Reinstatement, he insists, will be based on "confident steps toward 
rehabilitation, which should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement does not mandate rehabilitation or treatment for this 
gambling Rose. And Pete Rose wants it known he does not need any. He is not a 
compulsive gambler, he says. The agreement does not mandate admission (or 
denial) of guilt. So Pete denies it: "Regardless of what the commissioner says, 
I did not bet on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
This is known in the better care units as "denial." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is pretty clear that Pete Rose's life was spent ricochetting from 
the pick six windows at Turfway Park to the back rooms around Fountain Square. 
If it moved, Pete bet it.

But does anyone seriously think Babe Ruth didn't have a bet down on 
Dempsey-Tunney in 1927? Pete Rose is not the only ballplayer in history to have 
had his own bookie. At least it wasn't Arnold Rothstein. Ruth had his own 
bootlegger.

<P>
Has a deal been cut? Giamatti won't admit it, but plea-bargaining is the 
American way of life. Rapists get in on it, mass murderers, bank robbers. Pete 
Rose sees himself as the Prisoner of Shark Island. The victim of historic 
injustice. A guy ridden out of the game he loves on a rail because of bad 
companions. But he has agreed not to take the commissioner to court any more or 
challenge legally this apparent death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone would feel better if he would get on TV, like Jimmy Swaggart, 
and cry a lot. But Pete's no good at crying. He better hope Bart Giamatti is.

<DESCRIPT>  SPORT; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Hank Aaron says the period in 1973 and 1974 when he closed in on Babe Ruth's
career home-run record was a time he'd like to forget.;    "The Ruth chase
should have been the greatest period of my life and it was the worst," Aaron
writes in his new autobiography, "I Had a Hammer."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I couldn't believe there was so much hatred in people. I'm still trying to
get over it.";    Aaron, who finished with a record 755 home runs, needed a
bodyguard as he neared Ruth's record of 714. He received death threats and
hate mail, some of which he printed in his book.;    "I have a contract out on
you," one threat read. "Over 700 and you can consider yourself punctured with
a .22 shell. If by the All-Star Game you have come within 20 homers of Babe,
you will be shot on sight by one of my assassins on July 24, 1973.";    Aaron
said such letters only inspired him.;    "I kept feeling," he wrote, "that I
had to break the record not only for myself and for Jackie Robinson and for
black people, but also to strike back at the vicious little people who wanted
to keep me from doing it.";     Sherrill looks to students for kickoff help;
Now, when Mississippi State football coach Jackie Sherrill says "student body
right," he means it.;    Sherrill is looking for some hard-nosed student
volunteers to play on the Bulldogs' kickoff team.;    Sherrill is borrowing
the "12th Man" idea he used as head coach at Texas A&amp;M.;    "We had 252
students sign up the first year," he said. "The kickoff team turned out to be
one of the main reasons for turning around our program there.";    Sherrill
said a trimmed-down list of 40 hopefuls will join Mississippi State for spring
practice in March.;     Spinks, Round 2; Tommy Spinks was 16 when he was
introduced to the sweet science of boxing by his father, Leon Spinks, at a gym
in Detroit.;    "We started fighting. He hit me. I hit him back. He kind of
got the best of me," said Tommy, 18, who won his debut at the Golden Gloves
preliminaries in Chicago and fights again Tuesday.;    "I wasn't in shape, and
I guess he just wanted me to feel it -- that it's not a joke when somebody
hits you," said Tommy, a 5-11, 215-pound super-heavyweight.;    Leon said he
didn't think his son would be a boxer.;    But, Leon said, "I didn't mind --
if it was something he wanted to do. I didn't make him do it.";     MAY I BE
EXCUSED?; Cincinnati pitcher Randy Myers will be following the bouncing ball
-- not throwing a ball -- during the first few days of the Reds' spring camp
in Plant City, Fla.;    Myers has been excused from camp so that he can coach
women's basketball. Myers is a volunteer assistant coach at Clark Community
College in Vancouver, Wash., where he played college baseball.;  Absolutely,
this is a major risk. Next summer, Benoit can sign with anybody he wants to.
So it's going to make for a challenging summer. ';    -- Sonics President Bob
Whitsitt after acquiring center Benoit Benjamin from the Clippers  </TEXT>
