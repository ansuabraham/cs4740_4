<HEAD>Southwest Airlines Report Features Punch-Out Fun</HEAD>

   In addition to the facts and figures formally
found in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988
features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the
most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said Tim
McClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agency
GSD&amp;M, which designed the report.
   The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95
million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble
Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out last year
during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texas
and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually
painted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''
   Even though Southwest previously has taken a light approach to
its reports, McClure said it was a little difficult this year to
sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someone
punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''
   He said he persuaded Southwest that the unusual idea would
become enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up
for one.''
   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really
shows the personality that Southwest is,'' McClure said.
   Southwest, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,
is based at Love Field near downtown Dallas and operates a
distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.

   Voters may be able to find neither rhyme
nor reason in the workings of state government, but the governor
hopes to change that. Louisiana is looking for a poet laureate.
   ``We are looking for someone like a (Carl) Sandburg, a T.S.
Eliot or a Robert Frost,'' Ray Beasley of the Department of
Culture, Recreation and Tourism said Monday.
   The state Arts Council is looking for a poet to serve as the
state's chief balladeer, extolling the virtues of Louisiana and the
state's ``literary excellence and understanding of the literary
arts,'' Beasley said.
   The position was created in 1942, but Louisiana has not had a
poet laureate since Jean M. Boese of Alexandria left office along
with Gov. Edwin Edwards in 1988.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer will name the poet after receiving
recommendations from the arts panel.

   A single-engine airplane crashed
Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of
Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard, authorities said.
   Four adults and one child died in the crash, which witnesses
said occurred about 5 p.m., when it was raining, Albuquerque police
Sgt. R.C. Porter said.
   The airplane was attempting to land at nearby Coronado Airport,
Porter said. It aborted its first attempt and was coming in for a
second try when it crashed, he said.
   State police said the red-and-white Cessna P210, which seats six
people, was from Salt Lake City.
   Identities of the victims were not immediately available. The
bodies were taken to the Office of the Medical Investigator in
Albuquerque.
   Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting
about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed.
   ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,''
Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left.
   ``He did three banks. The wind made him bank to the left 30
degrees or so. To correct for that, he banked right and he kept
going and passed level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said.
   ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and
went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini, a student pilot.
``He hit the ground and cartwheeled over.
   ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' he said.
   The airplane ``wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet,'' Ramazzini
said. ``The weather was gusty and showery. It was sprinkling.''
   He said he was among the first four people at the crash site.
   ``We went up there and there was nobody alive,'' Ramazzini said.
``You could smell fuel. We were looking for fire extinguishers.''
He said the witnesses thought the airplane might blow up, so they
retreated.
   Firefighters arrived later and sprayed the crumpled airplane
with water before rescue crews removed the bodies from the craft.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were en route
to the crash site to conduct an investigation with the Federal
Aviation Administration.

   A student pilot who witnessed an
airplane crash that killed five people said the aircraft's lone
engine appeared to stall moments before it plunged nose first into
the ground.
   ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' said Walter Ramazzini Jr.,
17, who was sitting about 100 yards from the ditch where the plane
crashed on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
   ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,''
Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left.''
   Police Sgt. R.C. Porter said it was raining when the plane
crashed Tuesday afternoon several miles south of Coronado Airport.
   The pilot of the six-seat Cessna P210 aborted his first landing
attempt and was coming in for a second try when it crashed, Porter
said.
   State police identified the victims as Gary Brown, 31, his wife,
Melissa, 26, and their 2-year-old daughter, Lindsey, all of
Albuquerque; and his parents, Wayne Brown, 60, and Joyce Brown, 58,
of Salt Lake City.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal
Aviation Administration were investigating the crash.
   After the wind hit the plane, the pilot appeared to try to
straighten out the craft, Ramazzini said
   ``The wind made him bank to the left 30 degrees or so. To
correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed
level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said.
   ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and
went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini. ``He hit the
ground and cartwheeled over. It seemed like the engine stalled.''
   The airplane ``wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet,'' Ramazzini
said.
   Three fire trucks sent to the scene sprayed the crumpled
airplane with water and rescue crews removed bodies from the craft,
authorities said.

   The Boeing Co. on Wednesday released a photo of a
secret unmanned airplane it said made its first flight Sunday.
   Boeing released few details about the experimental aircraft,
other than to say it successfully completed its first flight and
would undergo further flight tests ``to characterize the
capabilities of this type of vehicle.''
   The airplane has a long, skinny fuselage with narrow, flexible
wings. It is powered by two propeller-driven engines, described by
the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology as
Teledyne Continental liquid-cooled piston engines.
   In April 1986, a similar plane was photographed outside a hanger
at the Grant County Airport in Moses Lake, in central Washington.
Boeing declined to comment on that aircraft.
   Boeing said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had
expressed interest in the aircraft and has provided some money to
participate in flight evaluation. The agency has classified certain
aspects of the aircraft design and performance, Boeing said.
   The plane resembles Boeing's Compass Cope remotely piloted
vehicle, an unmanned aircraft powered by a single jet engine.
Boeing built two of the planes for the Air Force.
   The Compass Cope was 40 feet long with a 90-foot wingspan. It
made its first flight at Edwards Air Force Base in California in
July 1973.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two engineers, convinced that a Connecticut
inventor beat the Wright brothers into the air by more than two
years, have drawn up blueprints for an engine they believe is
almost identical to the ones that powered that first flight. The
next step, they hope, is to build working replicas of the engines
in an attempt to prove that Gustave Whitehead may have been cheated
out of his proper place in history.

   Speaking with the passion of a television
preacher, Wes Gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolled
a sheaf of documents containing the long-lost secrets of an early
American inventor.
   When he had finished, Gordeuk leaned back and smiled.
   Spread across the carpet on his living room floor were the
blueprints for an engine that Gordeuk believes was used to power
the first airplane flight in the United States.
   ``There's a hell of a lot of detail here,'' he says.
   Gordeuk, an engineer and jet engine instructor at Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and Don Richardson, a former electrical engineering
professor from Stratford, spent more than two years investigating
the engine and drafting the blueprint. They are now putting the
finishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to build
engines based on the plans.
   The two are part of a team attempting to prove that Gustave
Whitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on Aug.
14, 1901, more than two years before the Wright brothers flew in
North Carolina. Whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the ground
for a distance of about a half-mile at Bridgeport.
   Whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for future
historians. There was mention of the flight in a local Bridgeport
newspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred, and the flight
also was mentioned in Scientific American magazine. But there were
no photographs, workbooks, or other ironclad documentation.
   Even the airplane and engines allegedly used didn't survive.
Whitehead enthusiasts say that is because, as a tinkerer, Whitehead
constantly disassembled his inventions and re-used parts for other
work.
   The state of Connecticut in 1964 recognized Whitehead as the
``Father of Connecticut Aviation.'' But claims that Whitehead was
the first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many,
including experts at the Smithsonian Institution.
   The Connecticut Legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking the
Smithsonian to review the matter, but to no avail.
   Undaunted by the skeptics, the Whitehead Research Society has
been working to quiet the opposition. It is building a flying
replica of the plane Whitehead is believed to have flown 88 years
ago. The plane is known as No. 21, an odd-looking, single-wing
machine modeled after a flying fish.
   Three years ago, the group unveiled a full-scale model of No. 21
that was made of the same materials used by Whitehead _ silk,
bamboo and pine. The replica underwent successful tow tests and
tethered lift tests.
   Gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructing
blueprints for the engines by making two propellers. The
64-year-old Cromwell resident followed Whitehead's notes and
studied photographs of No. 21, then spent 13 months carving the two
6-foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985.
   To draft the engine blueprints, Gordeuk and Robinson studied
photographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by Whitehead's
former co-workers. In addition, they studied engineering handbooks
and hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help with
their detective work.
   ``Knowing engines, you don't even have to see the whole picture,
because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give the
whole thing away,'' he says.
   ``We found that the hardware available and used by Gustave
Whitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today. The
standards have not changed.''
   Gordeuk had to go to such extremes because Whitehead left behind
no notes on his work. Some believe that his family discarded the
material many years ago. The scant documentation is one reason
Whitehead's accomplishments have been ignored by history.
   ``We've duplicated, we think, within 99 percent of the actual
engines,'' Gordeuk says. ``By no means was it easy.''
   The two engineers discovered that Whitehead built an external
combustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine. It was
fueled by acetylene gas, which at the turn of the century was
readily available and was considered as the fuel of the future.
Gasoline, at that time, was considered too dangerous a fuel to be
used in engines, Gordeuk says.
   Using acetylene, mixed with air, Whitehead developed a unique,
lightweight engine with tremendous power, Gordeuk says. The
double-acting, four-cylinder engines could produce about 10
horsepower a cylinder. Whitehead used one engine per propeller,
giving him more horsepower than the Wrights had on their first
airplane, Gordeuk says.
   ``He was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards,''
Gordeuk says. ``Why was he able to do this? Simply because he had a
third engine driving the front wheels of the airplane.
   ``The first airplane built that could fly and did fly was able
to take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest run
that hasn't been duplicated until recent years. Whitehead was a
genius. He was not a liar.''
   Having developed blueprints for the engines, the Whitehead group
has now reached its next obstacle. Gordeuk said the group is in
need of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so that
replica engines can be built. The group has not yet found a machine
shop to help.
   ``We are at somewhat of a dead end now,'' Gordeuk says.
   But he is far from disheartened and he is certain that his
engine and No.21 will fly some day.
   ``We're good engineers,'' he says. ``We know it's going to fly.''
   The Smithsonian ignored the Connecticut Legislature's request
and has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter, says Peter
Jakab, the museum's curator of early aviation.
   ``The governor signed a piece of legislation asking us to
convene a public hearing,'' he says. ``It's just not appropriate
for us to participate in that way. We're not an arbitrative body.''
   The curator says the Wrights fully documented their flight and
research, while the case for Whitehead is based on speculation. As
a result, the development of the blueprints for the engines is
interesting, but not historically significant, he said.
   ``While they claim to have developed the engines,'' he says,
``it's impossible to tell.''

<HEAD>Wright Brothers Sites to Get Federal Preservation Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government will study sites
where the Wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could
lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation, officials
said Friday.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said the National Park Service study,
expected to take 12 to 15 months, will help Congress decide whether
to confer national park status on the sites.
   A committee headed by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice was
formed to preserve the heritage of Orville and Wilbur Wright, who
developed the first heavier-than-air flying machine.
   ``Over the years ... we have lost many of the buildings, many of
the historic sites involved in the birth of aviation either to the
wrecking ball or to just plain indifference,'' Rice said. ``That
time is over.''
   The sites to be studied include Huffman Prairie, scene of the
Wright brothers' first flying experiments, and buildings that
housed the Wrights' airplane company, bicycle shop and printing
business.
   Also on the list are Hawthorne Hill, home of Orville Wright;
Carillon Park, home of the Wright Flyer III, known as the world's
first practical airplane; and Dunbar House, home of Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, poet and friend of the Wright brothers.
   William Gibson, a National Park Service official based in
Chillicothe, said the agency will study options for managing the
sites, including oversight by the state or local government, the
private sector, or the federal government in the form of a national
park.
   ``We are impressed,'' said Gibson. ``The historic resources
associated with the Wright brothers that remain in Dayton are truly
impressive.''
   The city of Dayton and Montgomery County plan to contribute
$35,000 apiece toward the study. Private contributions will also be
sought, officials said.
   While the Wright brothers constructed their early aircraft at
their bicycle shop in Dayton, they also are connected historically
with Kitty Hawk, N.C., where on Dec. 17, 1903, they made the first
controlled, sustained flights in a power-driven airplane.

<LEADPARA>  Whether it's painting airplanes to resemble killer whales, or dressing like
Elvis to greet passengers, Southwest Airlines is serious about having fun.;   
The off-beat approach by the airline, once dubbed the "Cattle Call" carrier,
comes from the top. And it's made a difference on the bottom line: Southwest
was one of only two major airlines to make a profit in 1990, earning $47.1
million, or $1.10 a share, on $1.19 billion in revenue.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NO KIDDING, MAKING MONEY IS FUN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     United Airlines was the other profitable carrier.;    "Having fun on the
job has a lot of benefits connected with it," said Chairman Herb Kelleher, who
has been known to dress like Elvis to greet passengers and play practical
jokes on his employees. "You don't have to surrender your individuality to
work for Southwest Airlines.";    Kelleher believes the breezy corporate
culture of the nation's eighth-largest airline -- from cash-register style
tickets to golf shirt-clad flight attendants -- has helped make the airline
more efficient.;    In fact, speedy ground crews turn around half of
Southwest's flights in 15 minutes.;    Kelleher has even had closets removed
from the front of Southwest's Boeing 737s when he noticed passengers dawdled
by it.;    Southwest offers few frills. There are no meals, and until recently
only beverages and peanuts were served. Cookies have been added to the longer
flights.;    Passengers aren't assigned seats, but are handed reusable,
numbered, plastic boarding passes when they check in. They then board on a
first-come, first-served basis, hence the cattle-call moniker.;    Such
measures have made Southwest's cost per passenger mile 6.73 cents, one of the
lowest in the business.;    Marketing savvy also has helped. The airline's
frequent flier program is based on the number of flights taken instead of
mileage.;    The airline drew some snickers in 1988 when it painted a plane
like a killer whale to promote a joint venture with Sea World parks in San
Antonio and San Diego. But it drew even more customers and now has three
"Shamu" planes.;    Southwest also has painted a plane to look like a furling
Texas flag -- Lone Star One -- to commemorate its 20th anniversary year this
year.;    "No matter what Herb Kelleher's title is . . . he is a marketing
genius," said Roy Spence of GSD&amp;M Advertising in Austin, the airline's lead
agency.;    Analysts expect Southwest's success to continue despite the
economic downturn because it has carved a niche as a short-haul carrier with
low fares.;    "Southwest has shown incredible resiliency during this period
of industry losses," said Paul Karos, an airline analyst with First Boston
Corp.;    Karos predicts higher profits for Southwest in 1991.;    Airlines
have been hurt in the past several months by higher fuel prices, the
recession's effect on consumer spending and fear of terrorism stirred by the
war.;    Southwest has managed to overcome those obstacles. During January,
for example, it had 13.1 percent more flights and added 17.6 percent more
passengers over a year ago. Last month it filled slightly more seats, 62
percent vs. 61 percent in February 1990.;    Nonetheless, Kelleher remains
cautious. "We're not recession-proof. We've suffered from the sparsity of
traffic, too," he said.;    In fact, the Dallas-based carrier has had its
troubles since its inception.;    When Kelleher and business partner Rollin
King mapped out Southwest's original routes -- between Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio -- on a cocktail napkin in 1966, they had no idea how hard it would be
for business to take off.;    Braniff and Trans-Texas airlines mounted
challenges in court and before aviation regulators to keep the upstart
grounded. Kelleher, a successful San Antonio attorney before starting the
airline, eventually argued Southwest's case in the U.S. Supreme Court. Its
first flight was on June 20, 1971.;    Then came the work of convincing
customers that Southwest was for real.;    "With the definition of commuter
airline then, you would have not thought of larger planes with seasoned
captains," said Camille Keith, the airline's first public relations chief.;   
And the airline has had to fend off fierce competition. In 1973, Braniff and
Southwest fought a pricing battle on flights between Houston and Dallas that
became known as "The $13 War" and is now written about in business textbooks.;
   Southwest's biggest competitive challenge now is in Phoenix, expected to be
its largest service point by the mid-'90s. America West Airlines, based there,
cut ticket prices in half in January, bringing some one-way fares to $20.;   
Southwest matched America West's prices with fewer restrictions. "Being able
to respond quickly and responsibly is the key to security and survival,"
Kelleher said.;    From the triangle of Texas' three largest cities, Southwest
has grown to 31 cities and 33 airports throughout the West and Midwest.  </TEXT>

   Lockheed Corp.'s prototype

Tactical Fighter contract.
   The YF-22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from Air
Force Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert
flight test center.
   The flight was a milestone in a high-stakes contest between an
aerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp.
for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 million
per plane.
   The winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable, uses
radar-evading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed of
sound for long periods of time. The Air Force wants 750 of the new
planes and the Navy needs 500.
   Pilot Dave Ferguson said the YF-22 flew as expected although the
flight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at ground
telemetry stations.
   The jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waiting
for takeoff that there wasn't enough left for the scheduled
one-hour flight.
   ``It was a very easy airplane to fly,'' said Ferguson, adding,
``I would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon.''
   The jet reached an altitude of 12,500 feet and a speed of about
280 mph. The two-tone gray jet with stubby wings and a V-shaped
tail touched down smoothly in a light rain.
   The YF-22 was built by Lockheed, General Dynamics Corp. and
Boeing Co. It was unveiled in Palmdale Aug. 29, two days after the
YF-23, built by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., made
its first flight.
   Lockheed Vice President Sherman Mullin, head of the YF-22
project, said he could not compare the two planes because he didn't
have enough information about the YF-23.
   Each team has spent about $600 million producing two prototype
jets each.
   ``It's obviously an extremely important program to us,'' said
Mullin. ``(But) it's not a program that's going to make or break
the Lockheed Corp.''
   Both planes are built of advanced composite materials. The
Lockheed aircraft has stubby wings. The Northrop fighter has a
longer, cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite.
   ``This is a great day from a technological perspective,'' said
Gary L. Denman, who heads an Air Force research division. ``I can
assure you, what's out there in the airplane is the best in the
world.''
   Survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened by
Congress until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts.
   If Northrop and McDonnell Douglas win the contract, the YF-23
would be built in California. The Lockheed-General Dynamics-Boeing
team plans to build YF-22s in Marietta, Ga., if it wins. The
selection is due in 1991.
   The $51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the Air
Force's present top fighter, the F-15 Eagle.

<HEAD>B-2 Flight Delayed</HEAD>

   The B-2 stealth bomber, unveiled last fall
after more than a decade of secret work, will not fly for the first
time before late spring or summer, the Air Force said Friday.
   Acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first
flight was in jeopardy, the service said that because of ``an
aggregation of minor system checkout problems, the B-2's first
flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time
frame.''
   ``Routine systems checkout of the first B-2 Advanced Technology
Bomber is continuing ...,'' the Air Force added. ``After first
flight, the B-2 will undergo extensive testing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.''
   When the Air Force made its first announcement last summer about
an unveiling for the unusual ``flying wing'' plane, it confidently
predicted the aircraft would be ready for its first flight in the
fall of 1988.
   The plane was ultimately shown to the public for the first time
Nov. 22 at an Air Force plant in Palmdale, Calif.
   Air Force and Pentagon officials said at the time they were not
going to rush the initial checkouts of the sophisticated flight
systems, but that they still expected the plane to fly before the
end of the year.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said Friday the
problems encountered by technicians all had been relatively minor,
but that it took time to prepare a plane for its first flight.
   ``We have said all along that we're going to fly this airplane
when it's ready, and not according to some calendar schedule,'' said
Mullaney.
   The spokesman added the Air Force decided to release Friday's
statement after encountering a problem with the bomber's
``environmental control,'' or air conditioning, system, within the
past week or so.
   A component of that system failed during a high-pressure test,
Mullaney said. Even though the system was purposely overloaded 50
percent beyond its design limit at the time, the Air Force decided
to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety.
   ``The fix for that is straightforward and corrective action is
underway,'' he said.
   The disclosure of checkout problems comes three months after the
Air Force announced the B-2 would carry a price tag _ including
research and development costs _ of $516 million per plane. That
will make it the most expensive airplane ever.
   According to the latest Air Force estimate, the design,
development and construction of 132 planes will cost $68.1 billion
by the time production ends in mid-1995. Even if research and
development expenses are excluded, each plane still will cost $305
million to produce on the assembly line.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost
invisible to enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic
composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar
waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross-section that
offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration
bomber, as opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate
enemy air defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of Ireland,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
Larry Newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.
   The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later
that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of Paris.
   Today, Newman is the only one of the three still alive.
   Anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed
in a West German forest during a race. Abruzzo, then 53, died in
1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in
Albuquerque.
   Newman, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in Phoenix, Ariz.,
said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary.
   But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10
years ago.
   Newman recalled that after the initial jubilation, Anderson went
to sleep while he and Abruzzo looked down through the clearing
clouds on the lights of Dublin, Ireland.
   The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that
drifted skyward. Newman and Abruzzo could hear dogs barking and
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' Newman said. ``I put my arm around
Ben _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I hadn't felt
that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.''
   The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle
II lifted up from Presque Isle, Maine, and headed toward Europe
more than 3,000 miles away.
   Newman says the flight was not without problems, including a
clash of personalities.
   ``Maxie Anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown
the flight by himself,'' Newman said. ``I don't know what Ben's
feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with. I didn't
want to be Charles Lindbergh.''
   Newman said conflicts arose when Anderson and Abruzzo both began
making key decisions.
   ``Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: Ben
Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson,'' he said.
   But Newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of
the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras
and navigational equipment. Newman's hang glider dangled beneath
the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over
the sides in bags.
   ``There were many times the flight was in question,'' Newman
recalled. ``But how close it came to failure at each moment was
interpreted different by each of us.''
   They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted
the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they
dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted.
   Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They
tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could.
   Newman said that at one point, a bit delirious from the
altitude, he chucked a $4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar
of peanut butter that weighed as much.
   Plans were for Newman to fly the glider down once they made it
to Paris.
   But 400 miles from Ireland, it came down to a choice of dropping
the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a
heater to battle Abruzzo's frostbite. The glider went.
   Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to
communicate by ham radio.
   ``The first guy I talked to wouldn't talk because I didn't have
a license,'' said Newman. ``And he didn't believe I was in a
balloon over the middle of the ocean.''
   Finally, Newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a
home for the elderly somewhere in England.
   ``His call sign was `G4JY.' I don't think I'll ever forget
that,'' he said. ``He talked to me until the last day of the
flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.''
   Newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement.
   A high point, he said, came over Ireland when a jumbo jet
relayed a message from the Smithsonian Institution. The museum had
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the National Air and
Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis and the Wright brothers' plane.
   In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to
Paris, where Lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first
solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over Evreux, France, they
realized they could not go on.
   The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of
champagne. They were 60 miles west of Paris, 3,107 miles and 137
hours from Maine where the helium-packed balloon had taken off.
   The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola
settled gently to Earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon.
   Hundreds tried to take a piece of history.
   ``It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' Newman said. ``People
were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.''
   The French press dubbed them the ``new Lindberghs.''
   But Newman says the only time he thought about Lindbergh was
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would
sleep in Lindbergh's bed at the American ambassador's residence in
France.
   Newman and his wife won.
   ``And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I
couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The bed was like a banana. The springs
were shot.''

<HEAD>Quantas Orders Three Boeing Planes for About $380 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Australian airline Qantas has ordered two
Boeing 747-400s and one 767-300 with extended range capability,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday.
   The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989
and will cost about $380 million, including spare parts and
support, Boeing said in a news release.
   Qantas Chairman J.B. Leslie said the new planes, which will give
Qantas a 43-plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to
Australia. The airplanes will be financed by Qantas' foreign
exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings, he said.
   The order gives Qantas six of the advanced-technology 747-400s,
the world's largest commercial jetliner, and five extended-range
767-300s.
   The four-engine 747-400, which made its first flight this
spring, can carry up to 660 passengers. With a more typical
configuration for 412 in two classes, the plane can fly more than
7,300 nautical miles, or from San Francisco to Melbourne.
   The twin-engine 767-300 is capable of hauling up to 375
passengers, but can fly more than 7,000 miles with 210 aboard.
   So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 401 jetliners worth
$18.2 billion, compared with 366 jets worth a record $19.9 billion
in 1987.
   Boeing now has 148 orders for 747-400s and 103 orders for
767-300s.

   The first Boeing 737-500, the latest version of
the world's top-selling commercial jetliner, was delivered
Wednesday to Southwest Airlines.
   Boeing said the 104-passenger plane was flown to Dallas, where
the regional carrier is based, 16 days after receiving flight
certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Nineteen customers have ordered a totak 193 737-500s, which cost
roughly $25 million each.
   As of last Thursday, total orders for all models of the
twin-engine 737, Boeing's smallest jetliner, amounted to 2,771
planes, said T. Craig Martin of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
   The more quiet, efficient and technologically advanced 737-500
replaces the 737-100 and 737-200 versions, which made their first
flights in 1967, Martin said.
   Production of the first two models ended after 1,144 were
delivered, the last a 737-200 for Xiamen Airlines of China on Aug.
8, 1988, said Martin.
   Other versions still in production are the 128-passenger 737-300
and 146-passenger 737-400.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Classic Planes on the Block
   ----
   By Joe Morgenstern
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6
</SO>
<LP>
   Santa Monica, Calif. -- At a recent auction of classic
aircraft here, I climbed onto the wing of a Curtiss P-40K
Warhawk to check out the cockpit. My pulse was racing, but
not from the climb. As a schoolboy during World War II, I'd
thrilled to newsreel footage of P-40 Flying Tigers shooting
down Japanese Zeros, doodled P-40s in class, even built a
solid -- i.e. non-flying -- model of a P-40, with a tiny
celluloid canopy and, pasted on either side of the nose,
red-and-white decals of the Flying Tigers' fearsome
dentition.
   This P-40 was flyable, as well as buyable by any bidder
with an itch to own a 47-year-old warplane that looked as if
it had just rolled out of the factory. The propeller-driven
fighter had been found in the Aleutian Islands in 1974 --
"the pilot's body was intact," a fact sheet noted -- and
restored to apparent perfection, right down to the rear-view
mirror above the canopy and the rudimentary gun sight, with
which the pilot -- still intact, for all I know, but not
included -- aimed the airplane to aim the guns.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As I jumped from the wing back down to the ground, a young
woman who had been admiring the P-40 smiled and said hello.
She was Japanese, perhaps in her mid-20s, and, according to
her press badge, a writer for a Japanese aviation magazine.
"Excuse me," she said in careful English. "Do you know why
those small Japanese flags are there?" Her eyes went first to
six little rising suns stenciled on the fuselage below the
cockpit, then to my face, which must have revealed my
astonishment. "Each one," I answered very carefully,
"represents one airplane . . . uh . . . shot down."
   "Shot down," she repeated slowly. "Shot . . . down. Oh, I
see. Thank you very much."
   A sense of history wasn't obligatory at the auction, but
it helped. And not just military history -- though that was
evoked by such works of martial art as a British Spitfire and
a twin-engined, twin-tailed Lockheed P-38 Lightning -- but
the history of aviation, which has produced some of the most
beautiful mechanical objects since the Industrial Revolution.
   A sense of wonder helped too, in the face of time-warping
treasures such as a gorgeous two-seater 1938 Curtiss Falcon
(serial No. 1) with red leather upholstery and intricate
patterns of riveted stitchery on dazzlingly polished aluminum
skin; a 1941 Ryan trainer, with sculptured wheel pants and a
birch-and-maple propeller; a 1918 Curtiss Jenny biplane, its
canvas wings held together by wire and hope; and a pristine
red-and-white Fairchild 24, first owned in 1939 by Mary
Pickford and Buddy Rogers and hardly flown since.
   The auction, organized for the benefit of Santa Monica's
superb new Museum of Flight, was the brainchild of David
Price, a 57-year-old industrialist and pilot who also doodled
warbirds as a kid in school, and who grew up half a block
from the airport, which was then called Clover Field (after a
World War I hero named Clover; so much for bucolic
resonances). Recently Mr. Price built the Supermarine
complex, a huge aviation service facility at the airport that
houses the museum plus a chic restaurant called DC-3. (Clover
Field was the home of Douglas Aircraft during the war.)
   "So far David has been carrying this museum," said Donald
Douglas Jr., who attended the auction. "Now we've gotta get
it off his back."
   The two-day affair, which moved more than $7 million of
airplanes and memorabilia, went a long way toward relieving
Mr. Price's back strain; by every reasonable measure,
including fun, it was a resounding success. Fun may have been
the most sensible measure for many buyers. Jim Mills, an
Indiana aircraft-engine installer who bought Mary Pickford's
Fairchild for $40,000 (a record price for the model and also
a steal) extolled the pleasures of flying slow, rolling down
the window and sticking your elbow out into the slipstream.
"That's all these things are any good for anyway, havin' a
good time with."
   Flying slow sounded equally good to Morgan Merrill, an
entrepreneur who lives in Aspen, Colo. He lusted after the
Jenny, which sold to someone else for $175,000, even though
he loves flying his own British-made, fire-engine red Folland
Gnat, a modern-day supersonic jet trainer, at speeds up to
Mach 1.3.
   Fun for other people at the auction involved the calmer
pursuits of connoisseurship and stewardship. Delford Smith,
chairman of the board of Evergreen International, a large
aviation holding company, bought the P-40 for $750,000; a
DC3-built in 1936, and the oldest still flying -- for
$165,000; and a Corsair fighter, with inverted gull wings,
for a record $750,000. (Corsairs are comers in this market.)
Then, prompted by associates and advisers who knew of his
love for bare-metal airplanes, he bid on the glittering
Falcon and got it, for $335,000.
   "We believe in preserving this heritage," said Mr. Smith,
who plans to find homes for his new acquisitions in various
museums. He also urged the Falcon's former owner, Richard
Durand, to call him any time he wanted to visit the airplane,
or even to use it. The gesture was appreciated by Mr. Durand,
who runs an aviation service company in Albuquerque, N.M.,
and who had sold because of what he called a "pretty rough
business climate for us now." But it didn't make the parting
any less sorrowful. "Don't leave it out in the rain," Mr.
Durand told Mr. Smith on the flight line, while his wife
fought back tears.
   The high point of the auction was the sale of the P-38
Lightning, one of six still flying throughout the world. For
one thing, this illustrious airplane, newly painted in attack
black, had been bought and restored by the Museum of Flight,
and was the museum's main chance for earning big bucks. Most
importantly, the Lightning seemed an irresistible symbol of
this country's sovereignty and creativity at a time when
foreign competition has been calling both into serious
question.
   When the bidding began, the crowd rooted for William Lyon,
a 67-year-old retired Air Force general who'd made his
fortune in real estate and airlines, and against an
unidentified rival, represented, via telephone hookup, by
City National Bank of Los Angeles. The rival might have been
from St. Louis or Staten Island, but was instantly assumed to
be Japanese, so the crowd cheered when the bidding finally
ended with Mr. Lyon taking the trophy for a record $1.55
million. They cheered for the general, for the museum and for
the nation, which had brought the Lightning into this world
in 1939 and could now, by God, hang onto it.

<HEAD>Tilt-Rotor V-22 Osprey Makes Emergency Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental tilt-rotor aircraft
designed to hover like a helicopter and fly like an airplane made
an emergency landing Monday after one of two engines failed, a
spokesman said.
   The V-22 Osprey lost power in its left engine, but was able to
return safely to Arlington Municipal Airport, said Terry Arnold,
spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   No injuries or damage to the prototype aircraft were reported
after the 10 a.m. malfunction in the skies about 40 miles southwest
of downtown Dallas, Arnold said.
   ``Actually, we're pleased, because the aircraft did what it was
supposed to do,'' Arnold said. ``The other engine engaged the shaft
and drove both rotor systems and we landed without incident. It was
designed to do just that.''
   Arnold said it was the first emergency landing on record for the
V-22. The cause of the malfunction was not immediately known.
   The Osprey can hover and land like a helicopter but also flies
at up to 340 mph as a fixed-wing airplane _ much faster than a
helicopter. Large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for
vertical flight and rotate forward for the long haul.
   Arnold said the aircraft, one of four Osprey prototypes, was in
``airplane mode'' when the engine failed.
   It flew in ``airplane mode'' back to the airport, where it
swooped down and landed like a helicopter, said Bob Leder, another
Bell Helicopter Textron spokesman.
   The four prototypes are among six Ospreys for which the Pentagon
has contracted.
   The Defense Department has spent $2 billion to develop the V-22
Osprey and its predecessor, the XV-15, for military use. But
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to end funding in favor of
conventional helicopter development.

<TEXT>
   The first 747 jumbo jet, which changed the look
of jet travel with its huge size and distinctive upper-deck hump,
has flown into retirement, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said.
   The red-and-white jumbo jet rolled off the assembly line near
Everett on Sept. 30, 1968, made its first flight on Feb. 9, 1969,
and won certification on Dec. 30 that year.
   Boeing has used the aircraft as a test plane for 21 years. Now,
the ``City of Everett'' is being donated to the Museum of Flight in
Seattle.
   Pan American World Airways signed the first contract for 747s,
ordering 25 for a total of $525 million. Today, that amount would
buy four of the jets, Boeing said.
   The test plane's only break in service was from October 1983 to
August 1986, when it was in storage in Las Vegas. It was then sent
to Wichita, Kan., where it was used as a mock-up for two 747-200s
that the Air Force will use to carry the U.S. president and his
staff.
   The plane had only 5,208 hours of flight time. That's very low,
considering a jet in normal commercial service flies 3,000 to 4,000
hours every year, company spokesman Tom Cole said.
   ``But it was tough stuff. They were always putting it into dives
and stalls,'' he said.
   The plane, officially known as RA001, had a short final flight
Wednesday: about 25 miles from Boeing Field in Seattle to Paine
Field, where 747s are built near Everett.
   There, its engines will be taken off and returned to Pratt &amp;
Whitney, which owns them, followed by some restoration work.
   Eventually, the plane will be displayed at the museum's
restoration facility or at a new large-aircraft interpretive center
the museum hopes to build at Paine Field, said Cindy Upthegrove,
the museum's special events manager.
   About 800 747s are in service around the world, Boeing said.

<HEAD>In Breakthrough, LOT Polish Airlines To Acquire 3 Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's national airline established two firsts
by ordering advanced U.S. aircraft and planning to offer two classes
of service in the new jets.
   Boeing Co. will sell three 767 wide-body jets to LOT Polish
Airlines, marking the first time a Soviet bloc nation has purchased
modern, American jets. The deal, announced Friday, is worth $220
million to Boeing and General Electric Co., the engine supplier.
   LOT also said it would offer business- and economy-class service
on the jets. Only one class of service currently is offered on the
Soviet-made aircraft that make up LOT's 45-plane fleet.
   The state-owned airline said the three jets would be used on
flights linking Poland with the United States and Thailand. It said
they should help double its traffic between Poland and the United
States as early as next year.
   The moves were seen as the first attempt by an Eastern bloc
airline to compete with Western concerns for Western passengers,
particularly business travelers, who pay higher fares but also
demand a high level of service.
   Boeing officials said they hoped the deal, though relatively
small, would lead to more deals with Poland and other Soviet bloc
nations.
   ``We're very proud and pleased that we were selected. It's a
major breakthrough for us,'' said Rudy Hillinga, director of sales
for Central and Eastern Europe for Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co.
   Boeing said it will be the first to deliver modern, wide-body
jets made in the West to a Soviet bloc nation because it will
deliver its first two planes to Poland before Europe's Airbus
consortium delivers two A-310s to East Germany under a previously
announced deal.
   Boeing will deliver two 767-200s in April and May 1989 and one
767-300 in June 1990. All will be extended-range models, powered by
General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Boeing declined to specify how
the $220 million price was split between Boeing and GE.
   Although Poland has a desperate shortage of hard currency to buy
Western goods, the airline is an exception because it brings in hard
currencies every time it flies to the West. That made the financing
relatively easy.
   In a deal financed by unspecified Western banks, LOT will lease
the airplanes and engines for 12 years, at the end of which it will
own them, Hillinga said. Boeing and GE will be paid by the banks.
   LOT said it will use the jetliners on its routes between Warsaw
and New York, Chicago and Bangkok, Thailand. Later, Montreal and
Toronto will be added.

  [Text] Stockholm--Saab Aircraft AB announced 17 January in 
Linkoeping that its new, radar-carrying Saab-340-AEW had made 
its first test flight, which lasted two hours. 
  The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model, 
which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab-340 
type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900-kg radar made by 
the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics. 
  The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary 
electrical power system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply 
the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its 
computers. 
  Sweden's Defense Equipment Office (FMV) ordered six of the 
aircraft for surveillance of national land and sea territory. A 
spokesperson for Saab Aircraft AB said that construction of the 
craft, excluding radar, would cost just over 500 million Swedish 
crowns (a little over 365 million French francs [Fr], give or 
take). 
  The new Saab-340-AEW, which the British have nicknamed "the 
poor man's AWAC", has attracted the notice of international 
specialists. This, says the company spokesperson, "is a very 
good sign for future exports." The first AEW will be delivered 
to Sweden's defense forces during the first quarter of 1995.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deliveries of some of Boeing Co.'s new 747-400
jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes said.
   Dean D. Thornton, president of the Boeing operating company,
said Tuesday that of the 161 747-400s ordered by 21 customers, 20
planes will be delivered an average of one month past the
previously agreed upon date.
   ``We intend to obtain Federal Aviation Administration
certification of the 747-400 in December, to deliver the first two
aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by
mid-1989,'' Thornton said.
   Two deliveries will be pushed back from December to early 1989,
and there will be a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989
deliveries, the company said in a news release. Most of the
deliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989, it said.
   Thornton said far more orders for the new jet were received from
customers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the program
was launched in October 1985.
   Thornton said the delays are due to the increase of 747
production rates at Boeing's Everett plant from two planes to five
a month and to customers seeking a wider variety of plane
configurations than on earlier programs.
   The delays also stem from the 747-400s being offered with three
different engine types, with each being introduced and certified in
a record four months.
   Boeing is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays on
customers, Thornton said, including working overtime and
reassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant.
   The new jet, which made its first flight earlier this year, is
the largest commercial jet in production. The plane will be able to
carry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles, and greater passenger
loads on shorter trips.

   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- A version of the Air
Force's next-generation fighter jet, built by Northrop Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., took to the skies for the first
time yesterday, setting the stage for a showdown with another
version of the aircraft built by a rival team of aerospace
companies.
   The twin-engine YF-23, with a Northrop test pilot, Paul
Metz, at the controls, climbed to 25,000 feet, and functional
checks of basic subsystems were performed during the
early-morning, 50-minute flight. United Technologies Corp.'s
Pratt &amp; Whitney division made the engines on the YF-23.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The airplane flies very clean, much cleaner than we
expected," Mr. Metz said. "During the climb-out, I was using
considerably less power than I expected, and the chase
airplanes were on afterburners just to stay with me -- with
my landing gear down."
   The other team, composed of Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and
General Dynamics Corp., is scheduled to roll out its Advanced
Tactical Fighter, the YF-22, tomorrow at a Lockheed site in
Palmdale, Calif. The first flight of that plane is expected
to be next month.
   The Air Force, which wants 750 of the jets to replace the
aging F-15 fighter, is scheduled to choose the winning team
in April and award the full-scale development contract three
months later. A second YF-23, which was delivered to a test
facility here in June, will fly with General Electric Co.
engines.

   The B-2 Stealth bomber
completed its seventh test flight Saturday, including an in-flight
shutdown and startup of its four engines, the Air Force said.
   The bomber took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave
desert at 7:14 a.m. and returned at 2:31 p.m. The 7-hour, 17-minute
flight included two aerial refuelings.
   Each of the aircraft's four General Electric F118 engines were
deliberately stopped, then restarted about midway through the
flight, the Air Force said.
   The bomber's crew also conducted normal and alternate landing
gear extensions.
   Air Force test pilot Lt. Col. John Small and Northrop Corp.
chief test pilot Bruce J. Hinds were in the cockpit of the advanced
technology bomber.
   The bomber was designed to reduce radar detection through the
use of composite materials and countoured surfaces, which absorb
radar signals instead of reflecting the signals.
   The strategic bomber made its first flight July 17.
   The B-2, which is capable of delivering nuclear and conventional
weapons, is intended to replace the nation's aging B-52 strategic
bomber fleet.
   With an estimated price $530 million per airplane, the B-2 is
considered the world's most expensive aircraft.

<TEXT>
   Two test pilots took a successful
15-minute test flight Sunday in a prototype of a revolutionary
aircraft designed to perform like both a helicopter and an airplane,
officials said.
   The V-22 Osprey, the world's first production tilt-rotor
aircraft, remained in helicopter mode throughout the flight,
according to officials of Bell Boeing of Fort Worth, a consortium of
two companies which built the craft.
   Bell Boeing officials described tests in aircraft mode as ``a
milestone soon to be accomplished.''
   The V-22 Osprey performed both a slow taxi liftoff and a vertical
takeoff during the landmark maneuvers and made conventional
``run-on'' landings, the officials said. Its top speed during the
tests was limited to 20 knots, less than 25 mph.
   The aircraft combines the operational capabilities of a
helicopter with those of a fixed-wind turboprop. With its engines
and prop-rotors vertical, the V-22 takes off, hovers and lands like
a helicopter.
   With its prop-rotors in forward position, the Osprey would become
a fast, fuel-efficient, high-altitude turboprop airplane capable of
reaching speeds of more than 345 mph.
   Boeing Helicopters President Don Chesnut said the Osprey gives
the U.S. military ``the ability to develop new missions and tactics
that cannot be accomplished by any existing helicopter or airplane.''
   Six flight-test prototypes are being built by Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc. in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia, a
division of Boeing Co., under a $1.8 billion full-scale development
contract issued by the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command.
   The versatile Osprey is the first modern weapons system designed
from conception to meet requirements of all four U.S. armed
services, with deliveries expected to begin in 1992.

   The B-2 stealth bomber is ready to fly
after successfully completing ground tests, and takeoff could come
as early as Saturday, the Air Force says.
   The bat-winged aircraft sped down a desert runway Thursday,
hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the
tarmac, said Brig. Gen. Richard Scofield, director of the B-2
program.
   ``We've completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first
flight,'' Scofield said. ``The airplane is in good shape.''
   The bomber, in development for more than a decade, has been
subjected to extensive computer-simulated flights but has never
actually lifted off a runway.
   It incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of
lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar
energy, rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do.
   But although the bomber appears ready to fly, congressional
opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the B-2
just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities.
   Congressmen warned Air Force officials earlier this week that
they face a tough uphill fight with the B-2, which recent estimates
indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pleaded with Congress
not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the bomber is
essential for U.S. forces to ``penetrate improving Soviet air
defenses.''
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
urged lawmakers to try to overcome ``sticker shock'' at the $500
million to $750 million price for each plane and to restore $800
million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month.
   At Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Scofield refused to be drawn
into the political debate, telling reporters: ``I'm working on the
airplane end of the thing _ and the airplane is doing just fine.''
   Scofield said engineers from Northrop Corp., which designed and
built the B-2, and Air Force officials would spend at least one day
evaluating data gathered during Thursday's ground tests.
   ``We will have to see what the data tells us,'' the general said.
``We'll be working on a number of issues.''
   Nevertheless, he made clear that Northrop and Air Force officials
believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne.
   After maintaining for years that the B-2 didn't exist, the Air
Force invited the media and dignitaries to a coming-out ceremony
last November.
   Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the
bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next
two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop in Palmdale, the plane will
cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in
fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.

   The first non-experimental aircraft that
flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the
spotlight Monday, hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators
and top military brass.
   The V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and hovers
like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, received a standing
ovation from a crowd of 1,600. The crowd watched as the camouflaged
craft was towed onto the tarmac at Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.'s
Flight Research Center.
   The first flight of the V-22, which has been in development for
30 years, is scheduled for Aug. 15. An advanced experimental model,
the XV-15, has been flying since 1977.
   Fort Worth-based Bell and Boeing Helicopter Co. of Philadelphia
are jointly developing the V-22 for the Navy, Marines and Air
Force. The three services plan to buy 682 of the twin-engine
aircraft at an estimated cost of $16.6 million each.
   ``It's kind of awesome,'' Marine Corps Commandant Alfred M. Gray
Jr. told the crowd.
   ``It works, it's ahead of schedule and will be a sound
investment for taxpayers' money,'' said Navy Secretary William L.
Ball III, comparing the tilt-rotor's production to the jet engine's
development as aviation milestones.
   ``You are proving every day that a great country can still
outthink, out-design and out-produce all comers,'' Ball said.
   The three military services plan to use the V-22 for combat
assault, search and rescue, medical evacuation and special-forces
missions. Other uses, including anti-submarine warfare, also are
being studied. The cabin can carry 24 combat-equipped troops in
addition to a crew of three.
   ``On our abortive rescue attempt made in Iran a few years ago,
think what could have happened if they'd had an Osprey,'' said
House Speaker Jim Wright, referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44
American hostages from Tehran.
   The Osprey, about the size of a medium transport aircraft, has a
stocky 57.3-foot-long fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick,
stubby wings. Its engines point upward during takeoff and landing,
with 38-foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground.
   The engines rotate, or ``tilt,'' forward once the V-22 is
airborne. Rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers,
pulling the Osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft.
   The tilt-rotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop
plane _ more than 360 mph _ but doesn't require an airport or
runway. It also can hover like a helicopter.
   ``I'm convinced that in the next 20 years there will be
thousands of these in use,'' said Bell President L.M. ``Jack''
Horner.
   Bell has talked with American Airlines and several commuter
companies about civilian uses for the craft, a spokesman said.
   ``The New York (and New Jersey) Port Authority is a strong
supporter of this concept,'' said Horner. ``We could build a lot of
V-22s for the cost of one airport.
   The British-designed Harrier jump-jet also takes off and lands
vertically, but using jet-propulsion rather than a rotor system.

It was about 2 a.m. Saturday when eight UC Irvine engineering students 
converged on a campus athletic field to assemble the human-powered airplane 
they worked all year to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By the light of fluorescent lamps powered through yards of orange extension 
cords, the students joined the tail boom to the fuselage, attached the 
propeller, assembled six wing sections and covered most of the aircraft with 
transparent Mylar. 
</P>
<P>
Before daybreak, there it was: Pegasus, its 100-foot-long single wing suspended 
like a giant white ruler against a backdrop of trees. And despite a soggy 
morning and a series of mechanical failures, the ungainly aircraft powered by a 
fast-pedaling cyclist actually got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear the wheels on the ground and then all of a sudden there's nothing 
between you and the ground," said team member Jeanne Pandes, 22, who piloted 
the plane on its first short flights. "You're cruising." 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is the third and most successful attempt by UC Irvine mechanical 
engineering students to construct a human-powered airplane as a senior project. 
The 1987 airplane, dubbed the UC Medfly, crashed almost immediately after 
leaving the ground. Last year's 
</P>
<P>
plane, UC-ME-FLY ("you see me fly"), succeeded in making flights of close to 
300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team used wing sections from UC-ME-FLY, but built a new, more 
aerodynamic fuselage that reduced the airplane's weight from 135 pounds to 120 
pounds, said project leader Greg Hill, 23. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-foot-long aircraft is made of balsa wood, sturdy carbon fiber tubing and 
transparent Mylar, a plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is one of eight senior projects in the mechanical engineering 
department, whose students also designed a human-powered car and a 
human-powered hydrofoil, both of which are scheduled to make their debut Monday 
morning in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m. Saturday, the weather was a major source of anxiety for the 
Pegasus team. An infrequent drizzle covered the wings with a film of water, 
which one student patiently scraped off with a yellow squeegee. Because of the 
wing's large surface area, Hill estimated that the drizzle added about 10 
pounds to the airplane's weight. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing black tights, white tennis shoes and a Pegasus T-shirt, Pandes crawled 
into the triangular cockpit and experimented with the pedals. The covered 
cockpit bore the advertising logos of the dozen companies that donated about 
$8,000 to build Pegasus. 
</P>
<P>
The team positioned itself for the takeoff, one student holding up the end of 
each wing and several more supporting the fuselage and tail. Pandes began 
pedaling and Pegasus quivered unsteadily from nose to tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go, Jeanne," one student urged the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft lifted off the ground, traveling perhaps 15 feet, then one of the 
wires holding the wings to the fuselage snapped. The students repaired the wire 
and tried again. Pandes piloted the airplane for four more flights, the longest 
of which was about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pegasus needed more power. So the second pilot, amateur cyclist Arcadio 
Biboso, was called in. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in yellow and black Spandex, Biboso's powerful legs lifted Pegasus on a 
60-foot flight. But he reported a problem with the pedaling mechanism -- the 
chain linking the pedals to the propeller shaft kept jerking, causing the 
airplane to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The team discussed ways to correct the problem and, in a last-ditch effort, 
attached a chain-tightening device with quick-drying epoxy glue and some 
string. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, with Biboso at the controls, Pegasus made its longest 
flight ever: nearly 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The next attempt was even more successful, with the airplane staying aloft for 
more than 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But as Pegasus was landing, the right wing hit the ground and snapped in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
In a post-mortem of Pegasus' flight, Hill mourned that "these wings are so 
long, so fragile . . . but that the plane has stayed together through all these 
rough landings says something for us, I guess."

Once the wires and propeller had been checked, the students pushed Pegasus 
across the soggy sod to the end of the field.

<P>
Wearing black tights, white tennis shoes and a Pegasus T-shirt, Pandes crawled 
into the triangular cockpit and experimented with the pedals. The covered

chain linking the pedals to the propeller shaft kept jerking, causing the 
airplane to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really control it," Biboso said. "I'm not really getting a steady 
rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The team discussed ways to correct the problem and, in a last-ditch effort, 
attached a chain-tightening device with quick-drying epoxy glue and some 
string.

REFLECTIONS: THE P-38 WAS THE HIGHEST SPOT OF MY WHOLE MILITARY CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas G. McGuire, retired Valley College English teacher and competitive 
marksman, fell in love nearly 50 years ago. The object of his affection was a 
sleek new airplane built in Burbank. McGuire, 70, writes for "Lightning 
Strikes," the P-38 National Assn. newsletter. He lives in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw a P-38, some nut in San Francisco looped the Golden 
Gate Bridge. I thought, "Oh my God!" It was 1940. I just dreamed of that damned 
airplane all those years that I was flying other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I graduated as a pilot in December of 1943. I went down to Santa Ana on the old 
daylight train, 220 young guys. When the war was over, I think about 69 of them 
were still alive, out of 220. I was lucky, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to fly P-38s, but I was sent to instructor school. I taught advanced 
flying for all of 1944 and a little bit of '45. I never lost one student. I 
like to think it was because I was very careful with them that I never lost 
one. 
</P>
<P>
I first went to Pecos, Tex. At Pecos, there was a cadet killed every week or 
so. We killed 13 in one night. We killed more men in training in the States 
than we lost overseas. A new pilot would ask, "How many pine boxes are going 
out of here a week?" Those statistics have never been made available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
We killed eight in one day at Chico. We killed nine in one day in Santa Rosa. 
My mother would phone the Red Cross from San Francisco because the paper would 
just say, "Midair collision in Santa Rosa, both pilots killed." I didn't know 
how hard it was on her. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to get out of the training command and into P-38s. Finally, I got my 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 is a wonderful airplane, a twin-fuselage, single-seat fighter. The 
cockpit is between the two engines. It's got a lot of weight. It's got a lot of 
power. It had a nice, soft, sweet hum about it. It was the most incredible 
thing there was. The P-38 fought in every theater in World War II. It was the 
first American airplane of any type to fly over Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
No airplane ever had that many switches, lights and gadgets for one man to 
handle. It was harder to fly, more complicated. And it had the highest death 
rate in training and operation. 
</P>
<P>
In fighters, a solo flight is a very hairy thing, but especially in a P-38. I 
was really scared, too. You've got two engines pulling like hell. You have to 
lock your wheels, your legs jammed against the brake pedals, and you run it up 
to 3,000 r.p.m.s. I just let go of the brakes, poured the coal to it and got a 
shock from that slam back against the seat. I never felt that before. I had 
never been in anything that powerful. I came around and made a good landing, 
too. I got this funny feeling about that afterward, like, "Did I really do 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
I never went overseas. I flew P-38s out of Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa was a real 
fighting airport, with loaded guns in the planes, in defense of San Francisco. 
They were afraid the Jap submarines were going to come up and make a run over 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
When the war was over, I had the weird experience of ferrying beautiful 
brand-new P-38s from Lockheed to Kingman, Ariz., where they were just left to 
rot or to be chopped up. 
</P>
<P>
When I got out of the service, they offered to sell me a P-38 for $1,300. I 
didn't have the money then. I was going back to school, so I passed on that. 
Now one of those is worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
They made 10,000 of them, but only 13 are left. The P-38 Assn. is having this 
big blowup in January in Santa Maria. They'll have some P-38s flying, and you 
can walk up and look at them or climb up the ladder in back. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 was the highest spot of my whole military career. It was the greatest 
thing that ever happened to me. No words can really tell what it was like to 
fly those things at maximum performance. It was a most amazing kind of thing. 
I've never used narcotics, but one of the guys who has, told me that going 450 
miles an hour at low altitude in a P-38 gives you a higher boost than any kind 
of drug.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In vast Alaska, highways are scarce, villages
remote and cars have limited use. Get a horse? No, get an airplane.
Here's one man's crusade to honor the aviation pioneers in
America's flyingest state.

   The remains of the airplane lay
rotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch, wings clipped, tail shorn,
body stove in, a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons of
bloodthirsty mosquitoes.
   To Ted Spencer it shone like a jewel.
   ``It can be restored,'' Spencer was saying, stalking the
remains, nodding. ``Yes, it can.'' His boots made sucking sounds as
he bounded around in the muck snapping pictures, oblivious to the
mosquitoes, his glee obvious.
   ``I heard about this airplane last year and didn't believe it
was true. When I came and saw it for myself, saw `Ptarmigan II'
painted on its nose, my heart leapt. Look, you can still read it.''
   Ted Spencer is the director of the Alaska Aviation Heritage
Museum which occupies a corner of the Anchorage airport.
   At 42, he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with a
professorial knowledge of them, especially airplanes of the
Ptarmigan II vintage.
   His aim is to document, through records and artifacts, one of
the most colorful periods in American history, the 20 years before
World War II when ``The Aviation,'' as it was called, came to
Alaska.
   The old airplanes themselves, of course, are the prime
artifacts. A proud array of them, restored to look like new,
contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead.
   ``What those aviation pioneers did in Alaska was no less
extraordinary,'' says Spencer, ``than men landing on the moon. What
they accomplished had immediate effects, and they were more
significant in Alaska than the advent of aviation in any other
state. They liberated America's last frontier.''
   Flying out to Willow Creek recently _ there being no other way
to cover the 275 miles from Anchorage _ Spencer pointed out the
window to a beach on the Kuskokwim River near the village of
McGrath. As if to document his own claim, he scribbled a note to
his fellow passenger:
   ``Carl Ben Eielson flew first airmail to that spot Feb. 1924.
Single-engine DeHavilland DH-4. Open cockpit. Came from Fairbanks.
Three-hour flight in winter.''
   Before Eielson's flight it took 20 days to make that 300-mile
mail run by dog team. You can see a photograph of Eielson and his
airplane at the Heritage Museum.
   More out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glory
days of epic feats, Alaska has remained by far the flyingest state
in the nation.
   According to Federal Aviation Administration figures, Alaska,
per capita, has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as many
planes as the U.S. average. It works out to one pilot for every 55
Alaskans and one plane for every 57. Alaska's 9,682 licensed pilots
average 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average,
including Alaska, of 49 hours.
   Hood Lake in Anchorage is the world's largest seaplane base.
Merrill Field, which handles only general aviation _ light planes
for personal and charter use _ is busier than the international
airports in Seattle-Tacoma, Salt Lake City, and Orlando, Fla.
   ``It's hard for people who haven't experienced Alaska to
visualize its vastness and its terrain,'' said the FAA's Paul
Steuke.
   ``We have only about 533,000 people, most of them scattered in
settlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane.
Our few roads, very few, are like streams without tributaries, you
can't get to them. Even if you could, they're often impassable in
winter.
   ``Add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictable
weather systems boiling out of the Pacific. Even skilled pilots
have to stay on their toes in Alaska.''
   How much more so, says Spencer, for the aviation pioneers who
established that almost mythic breed known as bush pilots. During
the 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men in
Alaska.

   A man trying to become the first pilot to fly
a solar-powered plane from coast to coast glided the craft across
the Mississippi River, a spokesman said.
   Eric Raymond landed the Sun-Seeker Monday in a field near
Greenville, Ill., about 50 miles from St. Louis, said flight
trainer Jack Whitehouse. Raymond flew 141 miles in four hours from
Fulton, Mo., he said.
   That put Raymond 1,620 miles into his trip, which began Aug. 2
in Desert Center, Calif. His destination is Kitty Hawk, N.C., where
Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful
heavier-than-air airplane flight in 1903.
   Raymond landed in a field because he couldn't reach an airport.
A wiring malfunction prevented use of the solar-powered batteries
his ultralight glider uses to turn the propeller for takeoffs and
landings, Whitehouse said.

The air in the radio compartment throbs angrily and the tentative shudder of 
the fuselage at low revolutions becomes a shake and then a wild cacophony of 
rattles and growls and blasting roars as, on the other side of the bomb bay, 
David Tallichet presses the four throttles forward. The old plane strains 
against the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tallichet releases the pressure on the rudder pedals and Number 
44-83546 begins its takeoff run, rapidly accelerating toward the hills in the 
west. Still ground-bound, the plane continues to buffet and wind begins to howl 
through the open hatch above the radio compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost imperceptibly, we are airborne, and Tallichet begins the slow 
climb out of Chino Airport. It is an exalting sight to look backward out of the 
hatch, down the fuselage and past the tail and see the dairy farms recede in 
the crackling air as Number 44-83546 thunders into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, on the roads, brake lights wink on and cars slow as the drivers see the 
great green ghost rising. It is an awesome object, out of place and time, and 
it leaves an indelible print on the mind's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes below squint to see the writing on the nose, beneath the gun. Does it 
really say "Memphis Belle?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It was a visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington in the 
early 1960s, along with some encouragement from another collector, that did it, 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Washington excited," he says. "I said, by God, that's what I'm going to 
do. I'm going to collect airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet had the means to do it, and the flying background. He flew 21 
missions over occupied Europe in early 1945 as the co-pilot of a B-17 Flying 
Fortress heavy bomber. After the war he remained on active Air Force reserve 
status until 1957, flying a variety of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1958, after a dissatisfying stint as a supply officer, he went on 
inactive status and opened his first restaurant, the Reef in Long Beach. It was 
the first of what would become a nationwide network of restaurants operated by 
Anaheim-based Specialty Restaurants Corp., of which Tallichet is today 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
As the money came in from the successful restaurant business, Tallichet and his 
partner at the time bought a pair of vintage planes, a Stearman and a T-34. 
Shortly after, Tallichet bought his first P-51 Mustang fighter for $13,000 and 
the promise of extensive spare parts that could be sold to pay off the loan. 
The seller skipped with the parts, leaving Tallichet to pick up the tab. Today, 
he said, he still has the restored P-51, which is now worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
After his Smithsonian visit, Tallichet began collecting and swapping planes 
throughout the world with the elan of a horse trader. He created the 
Chino-based Military Aircraft Restoration Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Specialty Restaurants, specifically to handle the traffic in vintage military 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"In relation to today," he says, "the planes were quite cheap and business was 
good, and I made quite a few trips" to places like New Guinea, the Yukon 
territory of British Columbia, India -- all to buy or sell old airplanes. He 
has owned, bought, traded or restored -- and, for the most part, flown -- such 
historical craft as B-25 Mitchell bombers, Korean-era MiG jets, P-40 Tomahawk 
fighters, F4U Corsairs, even giant B-29 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 68-year-old Orange resident, through his company, owns about 100 
planes in various stages of restoration, most of which are World War II vintage 
military aircraft. The majority of the collection is at Chino Airport. Between 
30 and 40 of them, he says, are fully airworthy. By any yardstick, it is an 
impressive collection. 
</P>
<P>
But, Tallichet says, none of the planes have gotten quite the amount of 
attention that Number 44-83546 has received in the past couple of months. It is 
a fully restored B-17G heavy bomber -- and Tallichet flew it during the filming 
of the current film "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
The plane played the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six years ago, combat pilots loved this plane. It was easy to handle. It 
was forgiving. It was tough. Some called it a tank with wings. Dozens of them 
got shot to pieces in the ferocious battles over Europe and still flew their 
crews home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an easy, gentle, sweet airplane to fly," Tallichet says. "You'd have to 
have a lot of bad luck or stupidity or both to hurt yourself in a B-17." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was built for function, purely. Creature comforts in this restored 
model are few. To walk from the radio room amidships to the cockpit, one must 
traverse the bomb bay on a catwalk barely the width of one's shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the darkness of the bomb bay is the brilliance of the cockpit, 
where Tallichet watches the gauges as the plane makes a left climbing bank. The 
whirling propellers are only inches away, but it is less noisy here because the 
engines are now behind us and no wind rushes in. It is perfect flying weather 
and the sun floods in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not the sort of flying that commercial airline passengers are 
used to. The four huge, 1,200-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines vibrate every 
inch of the airframe, and the cabin is not pressurized. There are sudden and 
unexpected small surges in altitude that force the knees to bend if one is 
standing up and it makes crawling under the cockpit and into the nose a 
stop-and-go task. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nose holds several revelations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tallichet acquired his B-17 the same way he got many of his planes: though a 
series of sales, deals, horse trades, some coincidental, some intentional. The 
brief version holds that Tallichet acquired and restored an Air Force B-29 
bomber and the Air Force, in return, gave him a huge C-123 transport, which he 
then traded to a firefighting company for a B-17 they were using as a plane to 
drop water and chemicals on forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
He began to scour the world for parts: a top turret, a ball turret, war surplus 
radio gear, bomb bay doors, a Norden bombsight. Everything it would take to 
restore the plane to its wartime configuration. That was eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the filmmaker William Wyler, 
began to piece together a plan for a fictionalized film based on her father's 
widely seen wartime documentary film about the combat career of the real 
Memphis Belle and her crew. As the production began to take shape and the 
search began for airworthy B-17s -- there are only a handful left in the world 
-- Catherine Wyler called on her uncle, David Tallichet. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew her uncle had gone through many years of his life and never found 
that hero status he wanted, being kind of a nobody in the war," Tallichet says. 
"So she said, 'Would you like to fly in my movie?' And I said, 'You bet I 
would.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tallichet flew his B-17 to England, where it was modified and 
painted to resemble the real Memphis Belle. (The real Memphis Belle is today 
restored as a static exhibit in Memphis.) 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morgan, the pilot of the original Memphis Belle, made a flight at the 
controls of Tallichet's version of the plane while in England to observe the 
filming, his first flight in a B-17 since the war. A studio press release 
quotes Morgan as saying at the time that the flight "was like five Christmases 
all on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
The nose, like everyplace else in the plane, is cramped, but it doesn't feel 
that way, at least not on the bombardier's seat. The seat is a small, padded 
swivel chair and it is at the very tip of the nose, just behind the Plexiglas 
bubble and the black metal Norden bombsight. The view of the ground is 
unimpeded and panoramic. It is like being hurled through space independent of 
engines, airplanes, physics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of view -- and feeling -- you get when you fly in your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is even quieter here, farther forward of the engines, in the area airmen 
called the greenhouse. Still, it's not difficult to visualize what a terrifying 
place it could have been while flying through fields of greasy flak or head-on 
fighter attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On this flight, however, there is nothing but bright sun and the comforting 
sight, just out of the tiny side windows, of the giant engines drumming away 
relentlessly. It is very easy to fall in love with this airplane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How much does it cost to keep a B-17? That depends, Tallichet says, on whether 
it works. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going good until you lose an engine," he says. "That'll cost you 30 
grand." 
</P>
<P>
And the parts are out there, somewhere, "in a garage, in a back yard. 
Someplace, somebody has the part if you have the money to pay for it," 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
The aviation fuel the plane gulps by the hundreds of gallons usually is paid 
for by those who hire Tallichet to fly the plane at air shows and other 
aviation events. 
</P>
<P>
He says he doesn't know what his B-17 is worth, and he doesn't want to sell it. 
But, he says, the last airworthy B-17 sold in the United States probably went 
for between $400,000 and $500,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The modern version of the Memphis Belle has kept Tallichet's Military Aircraft 
Restoration Corp. out of the red for the first time in its history, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost money every year but last year," he says. "That's when they made 
'Memphis Belle.' The money we got from that gave us our first profitable year." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet jokingly calls his passion for planes "an idiot's hobby." But for the 
man who says he never saw a propeller-driven fighter from the pilot's seat of a 
bomber until the filming of "Memphis Belle," it is an enterprise that keeps him 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"You fly it for the challenge, I think," he says. "I'm 68, and it's kind of fun 
to be flying in 1990 when most of my colleagues have long ago given up flying." 
</P>
<P>
The wind and the prop blast rush into the waist ports and over the mock-up 
.50-caliber guns, and the muscles in the thighs work harder to keep the body 
standing as Tallichet makes a final long, lazy bank to set up his final 
approach. The wind, the gently changing view out the open window, the pounding 
of the engines, the gold of the setting sun, all combine to become achingly 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels ($1,350 each) screech quickly on the runway and Tallichet turns the 
giant plane onto a taxiway. The propellers immediately raise a huge cloud of 
dark brown dust from the adjacent dirt infield. Out on the ramp, knots of 
people stand and stare, still transfixed, at this apparition from the past that 
comes thundering slowly toward them. It is too loud, too insistent, too 
overpowering to be a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is almost too wonderful to be real. 
</P>

<BYLINE>Air Force Makes Public First Drawing of `Flying Wing'
^By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted
together without any fuselage in the center. The Air Force says
that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber.
   Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the Air Force on
Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic
bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later
this fall.
   The service also acknowledged the program was suffering some
cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released
later this year.
   ``Some cost growth is to be expected in any development program
that is on the leading edge of technology like the B-2,'' the Air
Force said, using the bomber's official military designation.
   ``But the acquisition of the B-2 ensures our capability to
effectively penetrate Soviet defenses well into the 21st century.''
   The Stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly
without showing up on radar. While the Air Force has flatly refused
to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s, its
general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater disclosed its resemblance to a
``flying wing.''
   The drawing distributed by the Air Force Wednesday shows an
airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang. A small cockpit
rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are
placed to each side of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or
right angles. According to Pentagon sources, the plane also relies
on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and
composite materials for construction.
   The design has long been the object of experimentation by the
Northrop Corp., which is building the B-2 for the Air Force. The
company flew a propeller-driven version of such a plane, known as
the XB-35, in 1946.
   A jet-powered version, the YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and
was tested by the Air Force. But the service never purchased any of
the planes, and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the
early 1950s.
   The Air Force declined Wednesday to give a precise date for the
maiden flight, saying only that it would occur ``this fall'' and
involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at Palmdale,
Calif., to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``As the first flight approaches, many actions associated with
preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open,
without compromising program security,'' the service said in
explaining its relaxation of secrecy.
   Details of such things as performance characteristics, crew size
and maximum payload remain classified, however, the Air Force said.
Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design _ for example,
the placement of the engine exhaust outlets _ have been
deliberately masked in the artist's rendering, service sources said.
   The Air Force did acknowledge, however, the plane is going to
cost more than originally projected.
   ``While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally
estimated to cost $36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the Air Force is
re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current
and projected fiscal constraints,'' the service said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, lauded the Air Force for releasing more information
about the plane, saying the public needs to learn about ``a
revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent.''
   He predicted the bomber ``will render obsolete billions of
dollars of Soviet investment in their current air defense.''

<TEXT>
   Officials at a federal hearing into a
jet crash that killed 112 people said Tuesday they are not ready to
conclude that a hairline crack in an engine fan disk caused the
DC-10's engine to explode.
   James Nall, the National Transportation Safety Board member in
charge of the Sioux City hearing, said no final decision on the
cause of the July 19 United Airlines crash will be issued for
months, after the full NTSB meets to review testimony.
   ``This is simply a portion of the investigation _ part of the
early stages of it,'' Nall said on the first of four days of
hearings.
   Investigators are focusing their study on a disk from the
airplane's tail-mounted engine. They believe a flaw in the disk's
metal caused it to explode, sending pieces of metal ripping through
the airplane's tail section and severing the hydraulic lines that
give pilots control of the aircraft.
   A report released Tuesday said the fan disk of the jet's rear
engine had a hairline crack less than a half-inch long before the
plane's final flight.
   A Federal Aviation Administration official said last week that
tests on the fan disk indicated the crack was caused by a flaw in
the metal that probably was present when the disk was made 18 years
ago by General Electric Co.
   But NTSB officials said they have drawn no final conclusions.
   United Airlines spokesman Robert Doughty also said Tuesday that
it is too early to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion.
Doughty said experts have only had 12 days to study the disk.
   ``A full analysis takes two months,'' he testified. ``It's
really premature to make a judgment.''
   The NTSB report is based on detailed testing of the fan disk,
found in two pieces in corn fields near Alta, about 80 miles east
of Sioux Gateway Airport, where the airplane cartwheeled and burst
into flames as pilots tried to make an emergency landing.
   The report by NTSB Senior Metallurgist James F. Wildey II said
the disk had two cracks but that only one existed before the
explosion. The report said that crack was visible to the naked eye
after the accident, but did not say whether the crack was
detectable earlier.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Wildey did not attempt to
determine whether the crack was detectable before the crash.
   Lopatkiewicz also said the report does not conclude that the
crack was due to a flaw in the titanium disk that might have
existed for years.
   Wildley is scheduled to testify Wednesday.
   In another written report to the NTSB, flight simulator expert
John C. Clark said United pilot Al C. Haynes had virtually no
chance to make a safe landing after the hydraulic systems lost
fluid. Clark assembled a panel of experts who used flight
simulators to fly a DC-10 with no hydraulic controls.
   ``The consensus of the group was that the pilot could fly the
airplane but an adequate landing could not be accomplished within
the pilot's control,'' Clark said in the report.
   Engineering Test Pilot Phillip Battaglia of McDonnell Douglas,
which built the DC-10, testified that the company had not
anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines.
   Battaglia said that since there was no precedent, the company
did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with such a
problem, and said it was unlikely any instructions could help a
pilot safely land anyway.
   ``It's my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver,'' he
said.
   The plane cartwheeled to a stop at the edge of a cornfield on
airport property, which hampered rescue efforts, said the airport's
fire chief.
   Firefighters had trouble dousing the burning aircraft and
locating survivors because of the standing corn, said James
Hathaway of the Iowa National Guard. The Guard is in charge of
firefighting at the airport.
   The corn did provide refuge for those fleeing the burning plane,
acting as a barrier to the radiant heat, he said.
   The airport leases land along its runways to farmers. At the
time of the crash the corn stood 6 feet or taller.
   FAA regulations allow crops to be grown on airport land and
officials say the practice is common in the Midwest. But a proposed
FAA advisory to airports recommends that farming be limited and
that crops not be planted within 1,200 feet of any runway center
line.

<TEXT>
   A bespectacled language professor says no
one got his side of the story before mistakenly arresting him
because of a note he found that threatened to blow up an American
Airlines jetliner.
   Now that his ordeal is over, Peter M. Canning, 40, said at a news
conference Saturday, he's headed for a job interview at Yale
University. He was on his way Tuesday to a New Orleans convention,
where he hoped to have several job interviews, when a stewardess
mistakenly thought a note Canning found in his tray-table was a bomb
threat written by him.
   ``I thought it was a nightmare at first. It occurred to me that I
might wake up,'' said Canning, a lecturer at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   He said he hasn't decided whether to sue anyone over the false
charge of making a bomb threat Tuesday aboard flight 240 from San
Francisco to Dallas. He was arrested in Albuquerque, N.M., where the
plane made an emergency landing.
   Charges were dropped Thursday, after an 11-year-old boy admitted
he wrote the note and left it on the plane. The boy took the flight
just before Canning's and had sat in the same seat as Canning.
   When the dropping of the charges was announced, Jim Nelson, the
FBI's top agent in New Mexico, said he regretted ``any inconvenience
or embarrassment suffered by Mr. Canning'' but said the arrest was
justified based on what agents knew at the time.
   Canning's attorney in Albuquerque, Ray Twohig, said he has
advised Canning to wait a week or so before deciding what action to
take.
   Canning, in his first statement since charges were dropped, told
how he handed the note to a flight attendant after it fell into his
lap from a fold-out tray after lunch.
   ``Part of the note said, `There is bombs planted all over this
airplane.' ... Two minutes into reading this, I thought it was
placed there as a prank,'' said Canning, a slightly built man who
wore tinted glasses, jeans and a wool sports coat.
   He told reporters he gave the crumpled, two-page note to a flight
attendant, who walked to the front of the plane.
   ``Thirty seconds later she returned and said `Is this your note?'
and I said `No, it is not.' But before I could say anything else,
she spun on her heels _ she was understandably nervous _ but no one
ever came back to ask me for an explanation,'' he said.
   The plane was diverted to Albuquerque, where Canning was
questioned by the FBI for two hours and arrested. Later, authorities
asked him to supply several handwriting samples.
   ``I didn't start panicking, I started getting angry,'' said
Canning.
   He was arraigned in federal court in New Mexico and released on
his own recognizance.
   He learned that the charges had been dropped while driving back
to Berkeley in a rental car Friday night because no airline would
book him a seat. He had stopped at a restaurant near the
California-Arizona border and saw a newspaper headline.
   ``I'm now relieved, as you can imagine,'' Canning said.
   Before the incident, Canning was en route to the convention of
the Modern Language Association in New Orleans, where the Harvard
doctoral candidate hoped to attend several job interviews.
   Faculty members at Yale agreed to reschedule his interview, he
said, adding that it was too soon to tell whether missing several
other interviews will hurt his career.

<F P=106> [Article by Toshifumi Hirai, general manager of the Aircraft </F>
&amp; Ordnance Division of MITI] 
  [Text] The aircraft industry is in a predicament worldwide 
as a result of cutbacks in defense spending and poor business 
conditions among the airlines. Although the Japanese aircraft 
industry has been growing steadily up until now -- first, in 
connection with overcoming the handicap of being left behind by 
the rest of the world as a result of Japan's defeat in World War 
II and, second, in connection with surviving in the narrow niche 
in the market -- it has yet to face many problems that are now 
known to other high-tech industries. 
  Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft 
industry 
of any nation that it can not live without the support of the 
government, because of its close ties to the defense industry 
and because of the huge risks involved in development projects. 
In addition to that, the Japanese aircraft industry is unique in 
that the degree of its dependency on defense needs is much 
higher than that in the United States and Europe; there are only 
a few manufacturers that are dedicated to aircraft production; 
defense needs consist of mostly license productions; and the 
bulk of commercial aircraft and engine productions are also 
limited to subassembly-level productions. 
  Although we cannot deny that such an industrial structure 
has 
made sense up until now, it is obvious that, in light of the 
situation the world aircraft industry will be at the threshold 
of the twenty-first century, an increase in the ratio of 
commercial needs is urgently needed and supporting factors such 
as R&amp;D capabilities and human resources need to improve. 
<H5>  Pursuit of Autonomy </H5>
  If the first task consists in maintaining an optimum balance 
between risk-free defense needs and the risky commercial needs, 
the second task consists in tackling various projects that 
maintain the optimum balance. The projects that are currently 
under way can be divided into those that require developments 
under Japan's own leadership, such as YSX (commercial jet, 
seating 75-90 passengers) and the ``small engine'' project, and 
those futuristic large-scale international projects such as the 
``supersonic airplane'' and the ``ultralarge airplane.'' In 
addition to the above, there are projects that are already in 
the production or marketing phases, such as the ``B 777'' and 
``V 2500 engine'' projects. Development of new technologies such 
as helicopters and new materials should not be overlooked, 
either. While all of those projects need to be promoted in a 
concerted manner to order to keep an optimum balance, it is 
important for us to realize that the premises for it have to be 
aggressive challenges in technological innovations and the 
pursuit of Japan's autonomy under the framework of international 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Maiden Flight in 21st Century </H5>
  YS-11 was developed in Japan about 30 years ago (182 
airplanes sold since); more than 100 of them are still in 
service around the world today. Many people wonder why that 
turboprop airplane seating 60 passengers is, for whatever 
reason, the only commercial airplane ever produced in Japan, a 
country of such technological capability. But times are 
changing, and many promising buds are about to unfold. 
  The YSX project has entered the feasibility study phase 
already; if an economically and politically favorable conclusion 
comes out of it, development will start within two years, and 
the maiden flight will probably take place at the beginning of 
the twenty-first century. 
<H5>  Enhancing International Cooperation </H5>
  Despite its current stagnation, the number of airline 
passengers worldwide is predicted to increase by 6 percent 
annually on a long-term basis. Amidst the worldwide trend of 
expectations of long-term stable growth of the aircraft 
industry, which is certain to bring about innovations and have 
synergistic effects on related industries, Japan must try to 
further advance and expand its horizons while enhancing 
international cooperation at the same time.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't quite Lindbergh, but a Texas university
professor earned his footnote in aviation history Tuesday when he
completed the first trans-Atlantic flight in an ethanol-fueled
airplane.
   Max Shauck, a mathematics instructor at Baylor University in
Waco, Texas, landed at the small Toussus-le-Noble airport southwest
of Paris after a one-hour flight from Tours.
   He set out with Italian co-pilot Grazia Zanin from Waco on Sept.
15 in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often
rough weather to Canada, the Azores, Portugal, Spain and finally
France.
   ``We feel we have proved that ethanol is a very reliable fuel,''
Shauck said. ``You can't get across the Atlantic on an unreliable
fuel.''
   Proving the merits of the relatively cheap, non-polluting
ethanol compared to standard fuel drove Shauck make the journey,
which he funded himself at more cost ``than I care to think about.''
   Ethanol is essentially an alcohol fuel made from vegetable
matter, usually corn in the United States and sugar beets in
Europe. Shauck, who also does air pollution research at Baylor,
says ethanol retails for about $1.20 per gallon in the United
States compared to $1.80 for high-octane aviation fuel.
   ``It produces more power, it burns cooler and there's a lot less
pollution,'' he said. ``But we had to go out of our way sometimes
to find it.''
   Indeed, Shauck and Zanin's flight log includes a hodgepodge of
small stopovers in North America chosen chiefly because ethanol
could be delivered there.
   These included Paducah, Ky.; Newark, Ohio; Hazelton, Pa.; and
Suffolk, N.Y. The plane also stopped at Shauck's hometown of
Mansfield, Ohio.
   In Canada, they stopped at Moncton and St. Pierre-et-Miquelon
before lifting off from St. John's, Newfoundland on Oct. 20 for
Flores in the Azore Islands, a 2,000-mile crossing made terrifying
by rain and thunderstorms.
   ``It's a long way over a lot of water when you're flying a
little plane looking for little islands,'' he said. ``We didn't
have sophisticated navigation equipment.''
   They waited in the Azores for nearly three weeks for a shipment
of ethanol to arrive before flying to Lisbon Nov. 10. Shauck, 54,
and Ms. Zanin, 33, made stops in Bilbao, Spain, and Bordeaux,
Rochet-Sur-Yon and Tours in France.
   Technically, they became the first people to cross the Atlantic
in an ethanol-fueled plane the minute they touched down in
Portugal, but the original plan they filed with American
authorities was from Suffolk County, N.Y., airport to Paris.
   The fiberglass aircraft, a sort of flying wing built by the
Velocity Corp. of Sebastian, Fla., featured elevators, normally
found on the tail, at the front of the airplane and a propellor
mounted on the back.
   The whole contraption weighs about 2,100 pounds and can reach a
top speed of 200 mph.
   Shauck resists comparison with American aviator Charles
Lindbergh, first man to cross the Atlantic in a flight from New
York to Le Bourget airport in Paris on May 31, 1927.
   ``He is a hero,'' Shauck said. ``Everything now is different
than it was in his day. I avoided going to Le Bourget because I
didn't want to be compared to him.''
   Shauck said he would take a commercial flight back to Texas, but
that the aircraft will make one more trip _ to Ms. Zanin's
hometown, Trieste.

   Kirk Kerkorian makes most of his
news these days trading in movie and casino companies, but the
investor who's among those rumored to be interested in Eastern
Airlines made his first fortune in airplanes.
   Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA Communications Co. and the luxury
airline MGM Grand Inc., got his start in business by building a
charter airline after World War II. Over the years, he has showed
varying degrees of interest in Western Air Lines and Pan Am as well.
   Now, sources close to strike-bound Eastern say Kerkorian may be
interested in bidding on the airline.
   Kerkorian's staff wouldn't comment Tuesday on media reports
concerning Eastern.
   The 71-year-old investor, whose personal wealth is estimated by
Forbes magazine at $950 million, shuns publicity. But the complex
financial maneuvers of his Tracinda Corp. investment company are
frequent news, particularly in Hollywood, where almost weekly
rumors swirl over the fate of debt-burdened MGM-UA.
   Kerkorian controls about 80 percent of the movie company, which
he assembled out of parts of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United
Artists studios. In the last year he has proposed bringing in
outside investors to run the MGM half, then suggested he would sell
the UA half, then recapitalized the whole company with $180 million
of his own money.
   All or part of the company that made Oscar nominees ``Rain
Man,'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is officially up for sale now,
but most observers expect Kerkorian would try to structure a deal
that lets him keep a piece of MGM-UA.
   Another Kerkorian-controlled company, MGM Grand Inc., combines
two of Kerkorian's longtime interests: airplanes and Las Vegas
casino-hotels. The company, which reported a $6.2 million profit in
1988, owns the Desert Inn and Sands and runs a three-plane,
all-luxury airline between Los Angeles and New York, featuring
Boeing 727s adorned with a version of the MGM movie lion.
   Kerkorian, who was born to Armenian immigrants in Fresno,
ferried planes to Britain for the Army during World War II.
   In 1947, he started the nation's first non-scheduled air
service, linking Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In a pattern typical of
his later business dealings, he sold Trans International Airlines,
bought it back and then sold it again in 1968, eventually making
more than $100 million.
   The Eastern rumors would put Kerkorian in a situation similar to
his last flirtation with a big airline. That was in 1987, when Pan
American World Airways unions offered $230 million in wage
concessions if Kerkorian could buy the airline from parent Pan Am
Corp.
   Pan Am rejected Kerkorian's offer to pay $75 million cash and
assemble $400 million in junk bond financing and assume the
airline's $1 billion in debt.
   Kerkorian began assembling his present empire in 1968 with the
profit from the Trans International deal. He bought the Flamingo
Hotel in Las Vegas, built the International Hotel &amp; Casino and
bought 31 percent of Western Airlines and 48 percent of MGM.
   It is MGM that has served as base for most of his later dealings.
   He split the company into separate casino and movie operations,
combining the movie business with UA in a series of transactions.
Those included one with Ted Turner that, in effect, gave the
Atlanta media entrepreneur MGM's 3,000-title movie library for $1.5
billion.

A string of 48s brought an aviation record to San Diego lawyer Bill Wright. He 
touched down in all 48 contiguous states in his 1948 airplane within 48 hours 
of flying time. 
</P>
<P>
When Wright and two crewmen landed in Pendleton, Ore., last Tuesday, they had 
flown for 44 hours, 35 minutes and 57 seconds over 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 54, owner and pilot of the plane; Michael La France, 32, of San Diego, 
his co-pilot and mechanic, and Eric Presten, 25, of San Jose, a National 
Aeronautics Assn. certified judge, flew around the continental United States in 
a 1948 Luscombe 11-A Silvaire Sedan, the first to set a speed record for the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
In designing the route, Wright chose general-aviation airports at which any 
pilot could land because he wanted to do something other people could repeat. 
</P>
<P>
He used a long-range navigation device called LORAN and other standard 
navigation equipment for the flight, which was made during Learn to Fly Month. 
</P>
<P>
The crew, which took off from Needles on July 1, stayed at some airports for as 
few as 15 minutes, but spent the night at others, resting and waiting for 
better weather, Presten said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started the idea, I wasn't thinking of setting a record, but some 
guys at the National Aeronautics Assn. encouraged me to get into it," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men flew at an average speed of 130 m.p.h., beating their goal of 
making the trip in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
La France, who owns a smaller two-seat 1949 Luscombe, said that although he had 
little mechanical work to do on the airplane during the trip, the flying was 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
"It really called on all my aviation experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wright and La France said the '48 Luscombe is fairly easy to fly because 
the 92 produced were designed with businessmen and families in mind. In fact, 
the inside of Wright's plane looks a lot like a car because the parts come from 
automobile manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The original upholstery, ashtrays and dome lights were purchased from Cadillac, 
and the panel incorporates prewar Studebaker and Stewart-Warner parts. The 
3,700-square-inch window space also resembles that of a car, with its rear 
windows and overhead skylights.

   Folks around Fairgrounds Park who
thought they saw a lawn mower flying overhead weren't hallucinating.
   Not only did Clarksville inventor Freddie Roberts fly the remote
control lawn mower for several minutes in the park, he even made it
fly loops, turns and upside-down.
   ``I made it for fun and to silence a few critics who think I'm
crazy, including my wife,'' Roberts, 44, said Monday.
   ``Who says a lawn mower can't fly? This one can fly but it can't
cut grass ... unless we have a crash landing.''
   The flying mower, made of balsa wood and Styrofoam, weighs less
than 5 pounds and is equipped with a model airplane engine. It is
guided by a model-airplane radio remote control.
   Roberts, a model airplane enthusiast for 30 years, also flies
gyrocopters, ultra-lights and is getting his pilot's license.
   ``I plan to build a (remote control) flying Santa Claus and
sleigh with reindeer for Christmas,'' he said.

   A head start and a filibuster couldn't
stop City Council's meeting this week from becoming Durango's
fastest council meeting ever _ 11 minutes.
   The previous record of 12 minutes was set in 1984, when Bill
Casey was mayor.
   Casey, still a member of the council, tried a good-natured
filibuster Tuesday to protect his place in the record book, but
other council members cut him off by voting to call the question on
the one item on the agenda.
   Mayor Greg Bell banged the gavel to end the meeting at 7:40 p.m.
The meeting started at 7:29 p.m., a minute early.

<TEXT>
   When Alfred Wilhelm traveled from Germany
to Oshkosh in search of his roots, he never expected to hit paydirt
in a cemetery by meeting one of his living relatives there.
   The 38-year-old Bavarian was diligently copying birth and death
dates from headstones in the Riverside Cemetery last year when
Wilhelm Mauritz walked by.
   Mauritz, 84, was born in a farmhouse near the German-Austrian
border in 1904. His father, Joseph, wrote to three uncles living in
Oshkosh and asked them to sponsor their voyage to America. They
complied, and the Mauritz family came to America in 1905 on the
steamship Pennsylvania.
   But Mauritz's father did not forget his German relatives,
keeping in touch with them through letters and photographs. The
letters and photographs came back to his son via Wilhelm.
   The two first met last year when Mauritz struck up a
conversation with Wilhelm at the cemetery. Wilhelm explained he was
from Munich, researching his family history and then brought out a
photograph _ a copy of the same picture Mauritz had at home.
   The woman in the photograph was Katharina Drachsler, Wilhelm's
great-great-grandmother. She was also a great-aunt to Mauritz'
first wife, Rosa.
   ``That took me by surprise when he took that picture out and
says, `Where is this lady buried?''' Mauritz recalled.
   Wilhelm, who is on a second visit here, said he started tracing
his family history 10 years ago. ``My grandpa also searched for
family and I followed him,'' he said.

<HL> Rutans Find It Hard Getting Voyager
Aloft for First Nonstop Global Flight

   Burt and Richard Rutan have found that the world's first nonstop, around-the-world airplane trip isn't easy to get off the ground. 

   In 1981, 43-year-old airplane designer Burt Rutan and his brother the test-pilot Richard, 48, announced their intention to build a plane that would fly more than 25,000 miles around the globe without refueling -- doubling the world nonstop flight record of 12,532 miles, set in 1962. 

   Five years and 22,000 man-hours later, the Voyager appears to be poised finally to take off on its daring flight sometime this weekend. 
Although further delays are possible because of uncertain weather, the flight must be launched soon, or be postponed until spring when the winter's cold desert winds have gone away. 

   After the plane set a world record for non-destination, nonstop flights last July, staying aloft for 4 1/2 days, the Rutan brothers had hoped to make the world flight in late summer. 
But technical problems, including a major propeller failure, forced several delays. 

   On the trek from idea to runway, the Rutans had to win over a skeptical public and aerospace community, who at first failed to support the project, which is said to be as risky as the pioneering flights of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. 

   The challenge is immense. 
To follow the equator without refueling, a plane must be large enough to carry thousands of pounds of fuel, yet light enough to minimize the size and weight of its engines. 

   The 1962 nonstop flight record was set by a giant B-52 Air Force bomber, which has a 46,000-gallon fuel capacity but is too heavy to make a global flight without refueling. 
By contrast, a four-passenger, single-engine Beech Bonanza propeller-driven plane weighs only 3,412 pounds. 
But the Bonanza carries only 74 gallons of fuel, which means it would have to refuel a minimum of 25 times to circumnavigate the globe. 

   Burt Rutan, designer of the new Beech Starship business aircraft, conceived Voyager to weigh less than 2,000 pounds, yet carry nearly 9,000 pounds -- or more than 1,500 gallons -- of fuel and two crew members. 

   The plane is essentially a flying fuel tank, with fuel stored in 17 separate tanks. 
The airframe is made of ultra-lightweight composites of graphite and wood fiber, in a radical design that features small forward wings for maximum lift and flexible rear wings almost as long as the wings of a 110-passenger Boeing 727 jetliner. 

   Because the project didn't attract much corporate support, it limped along for years as the Rutans' personal funds ran out. 
"We looked around for one big sponsor who would put their name across the plane," says co-pilot Jeana Yeager. 
"But nobody wanted to take a chance on a 'paper' airplane." 

   Voyager finally began to take shape last year. 
The equipment, including many of the materials in the hand-built plane, was mostly obtained on loan or without charge from a handful of companies intrigued by the commercial spinoffs. 

   Teledyne Inc. adapted a long-range, high-endurance engine it makes for military reconnaissance planes. 
King Radio Corp., a unit of Allied-Signal Inc., developed the avionics. 
And Hercules Inc. and Hexcel Corp., makers of composite materials, helped build the molded structure, which they hope will demonstrate the use of lightweight composites to replace metal in aircraft frames. 

   "I heard they had this project going and told them we had a low-fuel consumption engine they should take a look at," says Donald Bigler, president of Teledyne Continental Motors Inc., Mobile, Ala. 
The company hopes to market the engine under the name Voyager for the next generation of business aircraft, he says. 

   Other companies lent computers and communications equipment or gave donations, such as the $3,000 that went to lease Voyager's "mission control" a trailer at Mojave's tiny airport. 
The companies received advertising rights for their support. 
In addition, about 3,700 individuals made donations of $100 each to the project. 

   After the Voyager's test flights this summer were plagued by technical problems, about two dozen aerospace scientists and engineers paid their own expenses to travel to this remote location about 200 miles northeast of Los Angeles to help. 

   Younger workers, lured by the chance to help make aviation history, have also pitched in. 
Several test pilots assigned to nearby Edwards Air Force Base, where the Voyager will take off and land, are helping to process flight data on their time off. 
Says meteorologist Larry Brunch, who analyzes weather data for Voyager between shifts at the local National Weather Service office, "They need help." 

   The volunteers formed a network among old colleagues, persuading the Air Force to allow an employee of its weather-monitoring station in Omaha, Neb., to help Voyager find a safe path around turbulence. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration allowed the Voyager crew to use a NASA channel for air-to-ground communications. 
Voyager carries an experimental emergency-locater beacon, on loan from NASA, that would be triggered if the plane went down in salt water. 

   Finally, with cold winds already whipping through Mojave, Voyager's volunteer crew is racing to get the plane in the air before the weather turns too ugly. 
Says Ms. Yeager: "We've spent all our money on this. 
We have to finish it."

<HEAD>Creator Of Sopwith Camel Dead At 101</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, the
adventure-loving creator of the famed World War I Sopwith Camel and
Pup airplanes, died today, his son said. He was 101.
   Sopwith, who taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing
airplanes at age 26, died before dawn at his 19th century manor home
near Winchester in southern England, his son Thomas said.
   ``Really he died of old age, but he'd had a marvelous (life),''
said Thomas Sopwith, 56, from his office in Brighton.
   The elder Sopwith, an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman
before he discovered his passion for airplanes, set several early
flying records.
   ``We had a lot of crashes in those days, but, bless you, it was
fun,'' he recalled on his 100th birthday last year. ``This new
experience of flying was one of the most exhilarating things that
had ever happened to me.''
   Sir John Lidbury, a former director of Sopwith's Hawker Siddeley
aircraft company, said: ``He was a wonderful engineer, with great
technical ability and flair ... Everything he put his hand to he did
thoroughly and well.''
   More than 16,000 Sopwith airplanes were built for action in World
War I, including 6,000 Camels, which shot down more enemy aircraft
than any other allied plane. A Camel flown by Roy Brown shot down
the German Baron Von Richthofen, the infamous ``Red Baron.''
   Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, born in 1888 into a wealthy
engineering family, was 16 when the Wright brothers flew under power
for the first time in the United States.
   Sopwith loved all racing, and became involved with motorcycles,
motorboats, ballooning and sailing before taking up flying in 1910.
   He bought his first airplane for 630 pounds (then worth $3,000),
and after two flights as a passenger, he taught himself to fly. His
first solo flight ended in a crash, but he wasn't injured.
   Sopwith founded Sopwith Aviation Co. in 1912 and gave up piloting
for design two years later. His company created the Snipe, the Pup
and the Camel.
   Jack Bruce, an aviation historian, said some pilots grew to love
the Camel, which he called a ``neurotically responsive machine,''
but only after they had spent time with it.
   ``(It was) difficult to learn how to handle but once pilots had
got the hang of it, (it was) quite exceptionally maneuverable,'' he
told the Daily Telegraph last year. ``But a lot of pilots were
petrified at the thought of it.''
   Sopwith's second company, founded between the wars, took the name
of his test pilot Harry Hawker who died in 1921.
   In 1936, Sopwith gambled by building 1,000 of his Hurricane
airplanes without an advance order from the government, but the
plane later became the backbone of the Royal Air Force when World
War II broke out.
   He retired as chairman of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1963.
   Sopwith was married twice, and both his wives are deceased.
   He is survived by his son.

<P>
A Riverside County man concluded history's first coast-to-coast flight in a 
solar-powered airplane here Tuesday, abandoning plans to fly nine more miles to 
his original destination because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Raymond, 33, said winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. persuaded him to scrub the 
last leg of his journey and instead take his plane by trailer to historic Kill 
Devil Hills, the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk where Orville and Wilbur Wright 
pioneered engine-powered aviation 87 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I landed basically at the beach yesterday," Raymond said Tuesday, one month 
and two days after his transcontinental trek began in the California desert. 
"With the forecast for winds and storms, it doesn't look like it is worth 
flying the last nine miles." 
</P>
<P>
Including Monday's 32-mile flight to Spot, where a storm forced him to land on 
a farmer's turf field, Raymond logged 2,467 miles during 119 hours and 23 
minutes in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those unofficial figures easily make Raymond -- a national hang-gliding 
champion from Lake Elsinore -- a world record holder in solar-powered aviation. 
The longest previous flight -- in a craft designed by Paul MacCready of 
Pasadena -- was across the English Channel in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, a lithe, bespectacled fellow, said he is not interested in records or 
recognition. He said his mission was to enlighten people about the potential of 
traveling with the help of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Solar is already quite practical for sporting aircraft," said Raymond, who 
built his 195-pound plane called Sun-Seeker, which resembles a giant dragonfly, 
in his garage. "Eventually, if the technology keeps improving . . . you will 
start seeing bigger and bigger and faster airplanes that are solar-powered." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of tourists, reporters and local aviators gathered at historic Kill 
Devil Hills on Monday and Tuesday, anticipating the pilot's arrival. Some were 
disappointed when they learned Sun-Seeker would not be landing amid the 
rippling sea oats surrounding First Flight Airport, but most seemed impressed 
by Raymond's feat. 
</P>
<P>
"What Eric has done is an example of creative engineering," said Gene 
O'Bleness, executive director of the First Flight Society, a group of pilots 
and aviation history buffs. His group, along with the Kitty Hawk Kites, held a 
cake-and-champagne reception for Raymond on Tuesday night and presented him 
with a leather bomber jacket with "Sun-Seeker" embroidered on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's journey began in the desert east of Palm Springs on July 16. Two days 
later, Sun-Seeker -- which uses solar cells to power an electric motor used 
during takeoffs and landings -- was damaged in Lordsburg, N.M., forcing the 
crew to return to Lake Elsinore for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The flight recommenced Aug. 2, and Raymond hoped to reach Kitty Hawk in 10 
days. Poor flying conditions -- ranging from thunderstorms to head winds that 
at times blew the feather-light craft backward -- slowed the pilot's progress. 
The plane was grounded by foul weather on 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the thrill of the journey, with its potpourri of sights and encounters, 
overshadowed frustrations caused by the sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to fly across the country," Raymond said, recalling how the panorama 
changed gradually from desert to woods to farmland and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avoid big cities with crowded skies, Raymond plotted a southerly 
course that took him through some of America's most lonely reaches. Among the 
crew's nighttime stopovers were such places as Cornudas, Tex., Chanute, Kan., 
Sedalia, Mo., and West Liberty, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The townsfolk and airport operators, Raymond said, were wonderfully hospitable. 
In Littlefield, Tex., the ground crew following Raymond accidentally wrecked 
the trailer needed to haul Sun-Seeker back to California. The local Chamber of 
Commerce president sent a team of mechanics to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking, 'Oh boy, what is this going to cost?' " recalled Raymond's 
wife, Aida, who followed her husband across the country in a chase plane. The 
local official, a glider pilot, refused to accept any money for the work. 
</P>
<P>
After resuming the trip, stiff winds and weak thermals -- the updrafts of warm 
air that lift Sun-Seeker to soaring altitude -- forced back-to-back landings in 
grassy fields in Missouri. The plane, made mostly of carbon fiber, suffered 
only minor damage to one wing that struck a bush. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond spent the long hours in his tiny cockpit -- which measures only 21 
inches wide -- reading maps, lunching on the fruit and cookies his wife packed 
each day and maneuvering his craft in the wind. The only discomfort was the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an air vent, but I close it when I'm trying to make the most distance," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A sportsman at heart, Raymond took advantage of the fierce winds Tuesday and 
went sail boarding. After returning home, he plans to start on his next 
project: a solar-powered dirigible capable of flying around the world. 
</P>

<HL> French Officials Discount Malfunction In Airbus Crash, Say Pilot Flew Too Low </HL>

   French Transport Minister Louis Mermaz discounted a systems failure as the cause of Sunday's crash at an air show of an Air France A-320 jetliner, while his deputy said that the plane was flying too low. 

   Officials said the investigation was continuing. 
If the culprit is human error as early signs seem to indicate, airline enthusiasm for the technologically advanced 150-seat twin jet probably will continue unabated. 
If the craft's computer-controlled cockpit is found at fault, sales could be jeopardized. 

   No A-320 orders have been canceled because of the accident, said an Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France. 
"Airlines are realistic," he said. 
"They know there's been an accident and they know there's an investigation under way." 
Another spokesman said later that the transport ministry officials' remarks vindicated the A-320's systems. 

   Mr. Mermaz told a news conference in Paris that initial investigation showed no evidence that the Airbus Industrie model is unsafe in normal operations. 
"No evidence at present throws doubt on the proper functioning of the plane," he said. 

   Meanwhile, Daniel Tennenbaum, director-general of the French civil aviation authority, said the plane was flying at only 30 meters (about 100 feet) when it made a pass over Habsheim airfield in eastern France. 
Mr. Tennenbaum said the new model's fully computerized cockpit requires eight seconds to react to a pilot's command. 
Because the plane was so low, the pilot had only five seconds before the craft slammed into the forest near the airfield and burst into flames. 

   But a U.S. spokesman for Airbus asserted that the accident "has nothing to do with the electronic systems in this airplane. 
There's a lag time between when you tell a plane's engines to do something and when the plane can respond. 
It's not peculiar to this airplane, it's a natural function of a turbojet engine's response to the demand for more power." 

   France's main pilots union said the plane appeared to not respond to commands, a problem which could be due to human error or a systems failure. 
The electronic thrust controls, which the pilot was attempting to operate to gain altitude, need eight seconds to reach full effect, giving little margin for error at low altitude, industry sources said. 

   Three people were killed and at least 50 injured when the chartered plane failed to pull up out of a low swoop over the airfield. 
The plane was carrying 136 journalists, dignitaries and other passengers, some of whom had never flown before. 
It had taken off from a large commercial airport at Mulhouse, on the French-Swiss border, and was scheduled to fly low over the air show, circle Mount Blanc, and return to Mulhouse, according to the Airbus spokesman. 
The presence of passengers on a demonstration flight is sure to raise concerns here about air-show flying regulations. 

   Air France has had two electrical problems on A-320s, the first on the inaugural flight in March and the second last week on a flight that was scheduled to fly to Amsterdam from Paris, but was canceled. 

   The A-320, which attracted a record number of orders prior to making its first flight 16 months ago, now has received 319 firm orders and 203 options and commitments from 21 airlines and leasing companies. 
Carriers that have ordered the model include Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Iberia Air Lines, Lufthansa German Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Indian Airlines and South African Airways. 
The biggest aircraft-leasing companies also have ordered the craft. 

   Because of this strong demand and a relatively low production rate, the earliest delivery date currently available for the $35 million jetliner is sometime in 1992 or 1993, the spokesman said. 

   The new model's three present operators, Air France, British Airways and the French domestic carrier Air Inter, all are scheduled to take delivery of additional A320s this year. 
Ansett Airlines of Australia is the next customer, and will begin taking its eight A-320s on order later this year. 
Ansett stressed yesterday that Sunday's crash wouldn't change its plans. 

   British Airways said it would put its two A-320s back into service today after a 36-hour suspension following the accident. 

   In Montreal, a spokesman for Air Canada said the airline will "be following the results of that investigation closely" because it is considering the purchase of 34 Airbus A-320 aircraft to replace its fleet of 33 Boeing 727s. 

   Air Canada's president and chief executive hinted strongly last month that the company had selected Airbus for the order, valued at about $1.2 billion, but a formal announcement hasn't been made. 
The spokesman insisted the airline is still considering the McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-80 and the Boeing 737-400 as well. 

   In Seattle, a Boeing Co. spokesman declined to speculate about the cause of the Airbus A-320 crash or its effect on aircraft orders. 
The spokesman said aircraft typically fly "pretty low" during air show demonstrations. 
"The altitude depends on the skill of the crew, type of plane, its weight and weather conditions. 
How far is too low?" 
St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas declined to comment. 

   A spokesman for Northwest Airlines, which has 100 A-320s on order, said the carrier is in touch with Airbus and is monitoring the situation. 
"We've seen nor heard absolutely nothing that impugns the integrity of that airplane," he added. 

   Northwest, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., is to receive the first of its A-320s in June 1989, with subsequent deliveries into the early 1990s. 

   A spokesman for Pan American World Airways said it was "premature" to comment on the crash. 
The airline, a unit of New York-based Pan Am Corp., has 16 A-320s on order. 
The first is scheduled for delivery in the 1989, the rest in 1990. 

   All of the planes now in service are powered by CFM56-5 engines built by a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. 

   Investigators yesterday examined two flight recorders for clues as to why the plane, which was delivered to Air France only last week, crashed. 

   According to a rescuer, the stunned pilot said: "I wanted to boost the power, but {the plane} didn't respond." 
The pilot and the co-pilot, both uninjured, are among Air France's most experienced and train flight crews on the A-320. 

   Unlike most jetliners, which use conventional hydraulic systems, the A-320 has a revolutionary design that uses computerized controls to convey the pilot's commands. 
Its computers can also override a pilot if he inadvertently orders the plane to do something dangerous. 

   Among the other questions raised yesterday was why the A-320 made the low fly-by with passengers on board. 
Neither Airbus -- a consortium made up of government-supported aerospace concerns in France, West Germany, England and Spain -- nor the other major plane builders allow passengers to ride along in flights that demonstrate more than normal performance of an aircraft. 

   But Air France, which leased the plane to the Mulhouse Aero-Club for the show Sunday, said that all of the necessary permissions had been received.

   A bird in the engine of a United Airlines jet forced the pilot
to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago on Thursday, and a
Northwest Airlines plane developed engine trouble and had to return
to Detroit, officials said.
   In New Jersey, a Continental Airlines 727 returned to Newark
International Airport after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the
pilot to engine power failure, and a Navy helicopter developed
engine trouble and was forced to land in the Atlantic Ocean about
10 miles off Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
   No injuries were reported in any of the incidents.
   The slew of mishaps came one day after the fiery crash of United
Flight 232. At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others
were missing and believed dead.
   In Chicago, the DC-10 en route from New York to San Francisco
made an unscheduled landing at O'Hare International Airport after
at least one bird was sucked into one of the engines.
   The 265 passengers and 10 crew members on Flight 23 were later
transferred to another airplane and continued their flight, United
spokesman Russell Mack said.
   ``The airplane was leaving JFK Airport, was climbing out after
takeoff, when either a bird or several birds were ingested into the
No. 1 engine, which is on the left side of the airplane,'' Mack
said.
   ``The engine experienced some vibration and the captain shut the
engine down, and then proceeded to ... O'Hare ... where he landed
normally and safely.''
   Earlier in the day, one of the three engines on the Northwest
Airlines Boeing 727 developed a compressor problem, and the pilot
returned the jet to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said Bob Gibbons,
spokesman for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline.
   ``We had the emergency equipment standing by as a precaution,''
he said.
   Flight 492 was carrying 146 passengers from Detroit to New York
City, who were transferred to another aircraft.
   In Newark, the Continental Airlines 727 made a precautionary
return after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the pilot to engine
power failure.
   Continental Flight 850, with 137 passengers and six crew
members, left Newark about 11 a.m. destined for Bermuda, said Dave
Messing, a spokesman for Houston-based Continental Airlines.
   ``There was no loss of power in the engine,'' Messing said.
``The indication turned out to be faulty.''
   The faulty indicator was replaced and the plane took off again
at 4:40 p.m., Messing said.
   In Florida, the pilot of the SH-3 Sea King helicopter, Lt. Henry
G. Bridgham, 30, of Monterey, Calif., had to use the aircraft's
other engine to taxi the amphibious helicopter ashore, said Nick
Young, a Navy spokesman.

<F P=106> [Article by Major Vadim Kinshin: "Advanced Maneuverability </F>
Fighter"] 
  [Text] Interest in raising the maneuvering 
characteristics of warplanes persists abroad. The military 
departments of the USA and Germany are conducting joint research 
on a number of aviation programs for the future. A program to 
design a tactical fighter with advanced maneuverability (EFM) 
occupies a special place. Series X airplanes are the first 
experimental models. 
  A joint international simulation exercise was carried out in 
1985 to evaluate the influence of maneuvering qualities on a 
fighter's combat effectiveness, especially in close combat. 
  Research was conducted within the program with regard for 
present trends in combat use of fighter aviation and air defense 
resources. This is associated with the fact that significant 
changes occurred in the last 10 years in the homing heads of all 
types of missiles. The sensitivity of homing heads and their 
scanning angles were subjected to modernization primarily. 
Requirements on the tactics of aerial combat, especially close 
combat, have risen: The modern fighter must have "tactical 
freedom"--that is, it must maintain its advantages until the 
absolute end of combat. However, for the time being we can 
observe a different picture--more than half of the "one on one" 
contests end in mutually observed missile launchings, or in 
other words, the potential destruction of one another. 
  In the opinion of foreign military specialists high-speed 
flight remains the best means of defense, because the commonly 
accepted trends in development and use of fighters have 
"wallowed at low speeds." Experts feel that it is only 
theoretically that a decrease in speed makes it possible to 
change a fighter's trajectory or maneuvering mode. In fact, an 
airplane's inertia does not change when it carries out maneuvers 
at high angles of attack, while its aerodynamic control becomes 
weak. As a result the possibilities for completing a maneuver 
quickly are limited. 
  Foreign specialists see passive inertial flight at a speed 
of 
around Mach 0.9 in particular sections of the trajectory to be 
one of the solutions to this problem. This approach makes it 
possible for a fighter to reduce flying distance while 
maneuvering, and to complete maneuvers faster. Forestalling the 
opponent in this fashion, the airplane can assume a more 
advantageous position for effective use of onboard weapons. Its 
kill capability will increase due to reduction of firing range.

  Two X-31A fighters were the first models of aircraft of this 
type. The airplane's configuration recalls that of the F-18 
fighter. The X-31A has a swept-back fuselage with flat side 
walls, low wings and a vertical tail fin welded to the fuselage. 
The engine's air intake has a movable lower edge, and it is 
located beneath the fuselage. According to design calculations 
this is the variant that permits the fighter to operate in 
optimum fashion at large angles of attack. Forward horizontal 
control surfaces--for pitch control and balancing of the craft's 
airframe--may be said to be yet another unique feature of the 
airplane's design. 
  The flight control devices of the X-31A are of the 
conventional variety. Presence of a group of three large vanes 
mounted near the jet engine nozzle is an identifying structural 
feature. They are intended for fast and precise deflection of 
the main direction of the jet stream by changing part of its 
flow in the needed direction. In this case the vanes keep the 
engine's thrust factor at its maximum. They are capable of 
increasing the total deflection of the main exhaust flow by more 
than 10 degrees, which makes it possible to obtain up to 17 
percent additional thrust energy in any selected direction. 
Consequently the pilot may quickly change flight direction, and 
maneuver without resorting to the assistance of conventional 
control devices. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-76A>           Variant of a Maneuver by the X-31A to </FIG>




  The wing structure is of certain interest. The wings are 
flexed in the vertical plane, and they narrow at the tips. Good 
aerodynamic qualities of the wings, especially at large angles 
of attack both at sub- and supersonic speeds, have been noted on 
several occasions in tests. The flat side walls of the fuselage 
made it possible to achieve reasonable characteristics during 
slip. 
  On the basis of maneuverability requirements the X-31A has a 
"load ratio" (the ratio of a loaded engine to thrust) of not 
less than 1:1. In addition the aircraft may be flown on the 
basis of flight control system data, while the layout of the 
fighter makes it possible to utilize full engine power even at 
angles of attack of 70 degrees. The high maneuvering qualities 
of the airplane are associated with presence of forward control 
surfaces. Tests showed that at large angles of attack in 
subsonic flight, a critical moment arises at which the center of 
gravity shifts toward the tail or nose of the fighter--it 
becomes unstable, and can spontaneously stall. It is to preclude 
this that the forward control surfaces are used. 
  Research conducted under the program revealed that owing to 
its advanced maneuverability, the X-31A can quickly assume a 
stable position while performing any dangerous maneuver, upon 
entering into a protracted stall, when the engine fails, or when 
the thrust control system breaks down. This is how higher flight 
safety of the X-31A in comparison with other fighters is 
accomplished. 
  There is one unique feature of the fighter's control: Flight 
control is linked to engine thrust control. Consequently the 
principal means of flight control is automatic, using the flight 
control system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-77A>           Variant of a Maneuver </FIG>




  Certain changes were made in the controls and displays in 
connection with the fighter's new possibilities. There is an 
additional switch on the joystick allowing the pilot to cause 
the aircraft to stall or return to ordinary flight. An 
additional piloting mark is projected onto the heads-up display. 
Its purpose is to indicate and warn the pilot of the real 
angular position of the airplane in space and its subsequent 
oblique displacements in the course of stall maneuvers. Tests 
showed that the peculiarities of control of the X-31A favorably 
affect the results of aerial combat, because it is hard for the 
opponent to predict the airplane's trajectory. In addition, 
stalling during combat makes it possible to more than double the 
number of missiles launched, and thus quadruple the fighter's 
firepower. In turn, the combat exchange factor rises by 160 
percent to a ratio of 1:3 in favor of the X-31A. A 15 percent 
increase in the airplane's mobility reduces losses to air 
defense fire by 75 percent. 
  New structural concepts and results of tests on the advanced 
maneuverability fighter encouraged further development of this 
concept. Thus America's Grumman developed a similar fighter, the 
X-29A, with forward-swept wings. Flight tests demonstrated the 
airplane's high maneuvering qualities: At angles of attack of 
25-40 degrees its speed of descent was minimal, and it made a 
complete turn in a radius of 350-400 meters. Control of the 
direction of engine thrust has also been reflected in a fighter 
of a totally different type--the STOVL short take-off and 
landing aircraft. According to reports in the foreign press it 
will have an improved aerodynamic shape and built-in thrust 
control. 
  The concept of advanced maneuverability of tactical fighters 
is now being used abroad as the basis of active efforts to 
design an airplane capable of changing its length while in 
flight.

   The total hydraulic failure that sent
United Flight 232 out of control also caused the worst single-plane
disaster in history in 1985, but pilots still don't train for it,
says a former DC-10 flight instructor.
   ``If it had only been partial hydraulic failure, I think he
could have handled it,'' Tom Eanes said of Capt. Al C. Haynes,
pilot of the United DC-10 that crashed last week at Sioux City,
Iowa. The disaster killed 110 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``We train for that. But we don't train for what he faced
because the airplane isn't controllable,'' Eanes, a resident of
Grand Prairie, Texas, said in a telephone interview Saturday.
   ``It's incredible,'' said retired DC-10 flight engineer Joe
Sullivan of Richardson, Texas, who was also interviewed by
telephone. ``I just can't believe it was successful.''
   Eanes said Flight 232's problems were similar to the
catastrophic loss of hydraulic fluid that crippled a Japan Air
Lines Boeing 747 in 1985. In that case, hydraulic lines ruptured
after the aft pressure bulkhead blew out.
   The pilot of the JAL airplane maneuvered for 30 minutes by
varying thrust from different engines before the aircraft crashed
into a mountain, causing the worst single-plane air disaster ever
as 520 people died. Four survived.
   Jack Gamble, Boeing Commercial Airplane spokesman, pointed out a
difference between the two cases.
   ``The JAL pilot was trying to keep altitude because he was over
mountainous terrain. He was trying to turn and get back to an
airport but he was over mountainous terrain. It was quite a long
distance to the airport. In the DC-10 case, he wasn't that far from
an alternate airport.''
   ``He (JAL pilot) did succeed in turning. He was headed back
toward Tokyo when he crashed into the mountain. The problem was he
couldn't keep altitude.''
   United Flight 232's crew, aided by an off-duty pilot who rushed
to the cockpit to help, used differential engine thrust from their
remaining two wing-mounted engines to control the wide-bodied jet
after its tail-mounted engine apparently blew apart and destroyed
the plane's hydraulic system.
   With differential engine thrust, a plane will slowly turn in the
direction of the slower engine.
   Without hydraulic power, the crew could not manipulate control
surfaces on the wings and tail to alter direction, raise or lower
the nose, or extend wing slats and flaps that increase lift during
takeoffs and landings.
   Flight 232's flight engineer told National Transportation Safety
Board investigators that the loss of the plane's hydraulic fluid
was ``immediate,'' giving pilots no time adjust those control
surfaces.
   But the crew managed to guide the airplane to a crash landing at
Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, where emergency equipment and
medics were waiting. The crash killed 110 but 186 others survived,
including the flight crew.
   Eanes said the United crew faced an additional problem.
   The damaged tail section assymmetrical drag _ that is, given
equal power to both remaining engines, the plane still turned to
the right. To counter that, he said, pilots had to overcompensate
with the right wing engine.
   That made the landing attempt even more difficult, he said.
   ``There's a certain point where you have to come off the power
to get on the ground. He obviously had to carry more power in one
engine than the other to overcome asymmetrical drag,'' he said.
   Eanes, who continues to fly for a commercial airline company
that he asked not be identified, noted that without control over
the wing slats and flaps, Flight 232's crew was forced to approach
the landing at least 80 mph faster than normal so the wings
wouldn't lose lift.
   ``How they ever got down to a reasonable height to even attempt
a landing is beyond my comprehension,'' said Sullivan.

   Authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a
crashed Boeing 737 Wednesday, but revealed no clues as to why the
jet's undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash
while the other engine burned.
   The Civil Aviation Authority, meanwhile, ordered increased
inspections on 37 airplanes with CFM56 engines, the type on the
Midland Airways jet that crashed Sunday. Investigators said much
more work was needed to pinpoint the cause of the crash, which
killed 44 people and injured 82.
   The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring
systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate
right and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm
system could have misled the flight crew.
   Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots
Association, said this showed that investigators ``must have some
suspicion of these circuits.''
   In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered
inspections of 300 Boeing 737s for possible cross-wiring of engine
warning systems.
   U.S. media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong
engine, and Britain's tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in
banner headlines.
   ``Error on the Flight Deck,'' the Today newspaper said. ``Fatal
Error'' said the Daily Star. ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine''
said the Sun.
   The Transport Department said that ``evidence obtained early in
the investigation'' indicated both of the plane's engines ``might
have suffered a related failure'' and that possibility was still
being examined.
   The statement from the department's Air Accidents Investigation
Branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire
and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had
told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
   The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear and
are still under investigation,'' it said.
   The jet, en route from London to Belfast with 126 people aboard,
plunged into an embankment a half-mile short of the runway at East
Midlands Airport in central England as it was trying to make an
emergency landing Sunday night.
   Hunt, whose back and legs were broken in the crash, was
interviewed for 45 minutes at the intensive care unit of Leicester
Royal Infirmary, said the hospital's deputy general manager Carol
Henshall.
   Mrs. Henshall said some of the ``wilder headlines'' had been kept
from Hunt, but friends and colleagues had told him of the news
reports.
   In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S.
government sources as saying ``the plane's flight recorders, which
monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate
the crew shut down the wrong engine. The trouble was in one _ they
shut down the other.''
   But the network said investigators had yet to detemine whether
faulty instruments contributed to the crash.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators,
said the crew believed they were making a routine, one-engine
emergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the
problem when they shut down an engine.
   Spokesmen for both the FAA and the National Transportation Board
said they knew of no information reaching U.S. officials about the
flight recorders' contents.
   The airplane's two ``black boxes,'' the cockpit voice recorder
and digital flight data recorder, are being examined at the
government's laboratory in Farnborough, outside London.
   According to court documents and federal officials in America,
the FBI is investigating a General Electric Co. admission that test
records may have been falsified at a factory which made parts for
the CFM56 engine that failed here.
   The Seattle factory also made a check and flow valve for the F404
engine aboard the Navy's FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard Kennedy
said Wednesday. A letter from a GE attorney last year said test
records may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves.
   The timer valve made by GE for the CFM56 engine could not have
caused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy
said.
   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m. Sunday. Government sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m.
that ``I have an engine on fire.'' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources
said he told traffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard
(right) engine.''
   The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.
   The Civil Aviation Authority said that on the advice of
investigators, it was issuing new instructions for the inspection
and monitoring of Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A320
airplanes, all of which use the CFM56 engine.
   The engines are made jointly by U.S.-based GE and a French
company, SNECMA.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said in
Seattle of the FAA's inspection order, ``We certainly believe it's a
prudent measure to go out and check to make sure there's nothing
wrong with the fleet. But certainly this precautionary measure does
not imply there has been any cause identified (for the crash.)''

   A Southwest Airlines passenger jetliner
made an unscheduled landing at Albuquerque International Airport
after one of its two engines was shut down in flight, officials
said.
   The 737 with 124 passengers aboard landed without incident at
about 8:30 p.m. Monday, said Ann Genett-Schrader, Southwest
Airlines' manager of public relations in Dallas.
   ``There was a compressor problem with the (right) engine and it
was really very minor,'' she said Tuesday.
   The company's flight 362 originated in Lubbock, Texas, and
stopped in Albuquerque about 7:20 p.m., officials said. The
airplane took off from Albuquerque at 7:40 p.m. bound for Los
Angeles.
   But when the compressor problem occurred, the pilot shut down
the engine and returned the craft to Albuquerque, Ms.
Genett-Schrader said.
   The passengers continued to their destination on another flight.
