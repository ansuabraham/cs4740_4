   One of three trapped whales disappeared
under the ice and was presumed dead today, a biologist said only
hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the
animals closer to open water.
   The whale named Bone was last seen late Friday afternoon, said
Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist helping lead the
effort to rescue the three California gray whales.
   By midnight, Carroll and others on the ice near this small town
on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope that Bone might rejoin the
others. Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet have stuck together since
becoming trapped in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago
during their annual migration southward.
   The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had
been rubbed down to the bone by the rough ice surrounding a
breathing hole that kept the mammals alive. That condition may have
led to Bone's death, said biologist Craig George.
   ``Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' George
said.
   Eskimos led the whales almost a half mile closer to open water
earlier Friday by carving a string of 24 breathing holes in the ice
away from the main hole the animals had been using.
   Meanwhile, a helicopter-dropped concrete ``bullet'' bashed a
trail from the direction of the open water.
   About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale
hunters, worked about eight hours to cut the 10-by-30-foot holes
with chain saws.
   ``The whales have moved all the way to the 24th hole,'' said
Col. Tom Carroll, commander of the Alaska Army National Guard's
portion of the rescue effort. ``I'm not sure how they did it, but
leave it up to Eskimo ingenuity.''
   De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water,
freed the Eskimos to work on new holes. Until two Minnesota men
brought the devices earlier this week, rescuers had spent all their
time keeping the original breathing holes from freezing up.
   Another dozen de-icing devices and a dozen more chain saws were
on the way to Barrow.
   A huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard began
working toward the whales from about four miles away, so as not to
scare the mammals. It used a 5-ton, steel-tipped concrete block
suspended from its belly to punch four 15-to-20-foot holes in the
ice at 75-yard intervals.
   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the
`bullet','' said Spec. 4 Wade Palmer, a Guard spokesman. ``It drops
through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back
out.''
   A second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort to
tow a 185-ton icebreaking ``hover-barge'' 230 miles from Prudhoe
Bay, and was to fly to Barrow today to help bash more holes in the
ice, said Tom Carroll.
   The first helicopter began working just inside a troublesome ice
ridge that blocks the path to freedom and lies about a quarter-mile
from an area of open water leading to the sea.
   The ridge, formed when drifting pack ice collided with ice
anchored on the ocean bottom, is too thick to be punctured by the
helicopters, and demolition experts were on their way to assess the
situation, said Geoff Carroll.
   ``We looked for an alternate route (bypassing the ridge) and
didn't find it,'' Carroll said. ``If there's no way through it, it
will have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways
from it.''
   Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries Service has
expressed reluctance to use explosives for fear they might harm
other marine mammals.
   The Soviet Union offered Friday to send an icebreaking vessel
now 300 miles miles from Point Barrow to help carve a path for the
trapped whales. But Carroll said water in the area may be too
shallow for the vessel.
   Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice to
within four miles of the whales Friday, giving added urgency to the
effort to free them before a shift in the wind could pinch off the
escape routes.
   The whales still would face a 200-mile trek through the leads to
reach open sea, and weather forecasts indicate the favorable wind
may end this weekend.
   The whales also have Eskimo names. Kanik (Snowflake) for Bone,
Putu (Icehole) for Crossbeak and Siku (Ice) for Bonnet.

   A huge icebreaking barge today began its
journey to rescue three trapped whales as scientists worried that
plunging temperatures and polar bears would threaten the mammals
they have named Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone.
   Early today, a National Guard helicopter rigged to tow the
185-ton ``hover-barge'' resumed the 230-mile trip along the
desolate Arctic coast from Prudhoe Bay. It moved about five miles
Wednesday through sand bars, mud and shallow water.
   The 24- to 30-foot-long California gray whales, whose species is
endangered, became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating
south.
   Eskimo whalers using chain saws in sub-zero temperatures have
been cutting holes in the thick Arctic Ocean ice to help the
mammals breathe. They got a boost Wednesday when two
brothers-in-law from Minnesota brought six $400 de-icers to the
$500,000 rescue effort.
   Greg Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, of Lakeland, flew to Alaska at
their own expense to demonstrate the devices, invented by
Skluzacek's father, when rescue coordinators politely refused their
offer to help.
   Early today, under the skeptical supervision of the
coordinators, they quickly cleared ice and slush from the two
breathing holes, accomplishing in hours what had been taking the
rescue team, using chain saws, pickaxes and steel bars, a day to do.
   The cylindrical de-icer, about 9 inches around and 14 inches
long, floats in the water suspended beneath a styrofoam slab. A
small, double-blade propeller pulls warmer water up from below and
emits it with 34 pounds of thrust.
   Within 24 hours, the breathing holes should be about 30 feet by
70 feet _ three to four times the original size, Skluzacek said.
   The devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becoming
frozen in the winter, Ferrian said.
   The tired whales can survive for several more weeks despite
being battered and bleeding from grating against jagged ice, said
John Lien, professor of animal behavior at Memorial University in
Canada.
   ``They can bleed a barrel and still be fine,'' said Lien, who
has helped free whales from ice for 20 years. ``We're talking about
a big animal here, between five to 20 tons.''
   The whales also may have to contend with polar bears. Reporters
flying by helicopter Wednesday spotted five prowling the ice a few
miles from the whales.
   ``There are polar bears that are certainly going to be attracted
to this,'' said Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. ``If they're going to take the whales, we're not going to
stop them.''
   He said polar bears hunt at night, when biologists are usually
the only people near the breathing holes, 18 miles northeast of
this Eskimo village.
   The whales were named by biologists so the mammals' respiration
could be monitored when they surfaced. One was dubbed ``Bone''
because so much of its snout has been scraped away by the ice.
Eskimos have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole)
and Kanik (Snowflake).
   A National Weather Service ice analysis showed no open water in
the whales' vicinity. But a lead, or pathway, through the ice had
been spotted about five miles from the whales, said Jim Brooks,
acting director of the fisheries service in Alaska.
   ``There are open water leads throughout the Chukchi Sea and
Beaufort Sea, out for a long ways. The ice is always moving. It's
very dynamic,'' he said.
   Brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach open
water, about 200 miles southwest, even if they could get to the
leads.
   ``But the hope is that they will be able to make it through the
leads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in their
migration. But the gray whale is not an ice-adapted animal. It just
doesn't seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as other
species of whale,'' he said.
   Rescuers sought ways to coax the animals in the direction of
open water if icebreaking efforts were successful, including using
lights as a lure near two new breathing holes cut for them. But the
mammals have shown little interest.
   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry said tape recordings of
the sounds of other gray whales were being shipped to Barrow to try
to lure the animals to open water. If they don't respond to that,
biologists said, they have tapes of killer whales that might spur
the three young whales to escape.
   The barge was not expected to reach Barrow at least until midday
Friday, officials said.
   ``We're pretty optimistic,'' said Pete Leathard, president of
Veco Inc., the oil service company that owns the propulsionless air
cushion vehicle. ``It looks like it will be moving a little faster
now that it's cleared most of the mud and sandbars in the harbor.''
   Another National Guard Skycrane helicopter assigned to the
towing mission may be used instead to lift a huge reinforced
concrete cylinder to Barrow where it will be dropped to smash holes
through the ice. The slabs are leftover supports from construction
of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, fitted so they can be carried by
helicopters.
   ``That's going to Plan B,'' said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswoman
for the guard. ``We have a 9,000- and a 14,000-pound concrete
reinforced slab. ... They'll start dropping that from the Barrow
end.''

   Soviet flotillas churned toward Barrow to
offer help for two trapped whales as rescuers tried to lure the
mammals to freedom, but biologists said they may have to airlift
the animals to open water.
   ``We're having a net built right now'' to carry them, David
Withrow of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle said Sunday.
   He emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred
alternative, to be used only if rescuers fail to coax the
California gray whales to open water though a series of freshly cut
air holes in the ice.
   A third whale, the smallest and the youngest of the mammals
trapped in moving ice more than two weeks ago before they could
migrate south, disappeared Friday and was presumed dead.
   A pontoon-mounted ice auger known as an Archimedes screw tractor
was delivered during the weekend by a huge Air Force C-5A cargo
plane and was reassembled Sunday.
   The device was to begin work today on the outside edge of an ice
pressure ridge that stands between the whales and freedom.
   ``That's the next big project for us,'' said NOAA biologist Ron
Morris, coordinator of the rescue.
   NOAA asked the Soviet Union for help, and America's Arctic
neighbor ordered the icebreakers Admiral Makarov and Vladimir
Arseniev to Barrow, said NOAA Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen,
director of the Pacific Marine Center in Seattle.
   The ships were 140 nautical miles from the Barrow area, the
Soviet news agency Tass reported today.
   Another flotilla unloaded equipment for a Soviet station at the
North Pole before heading immediately for Alaska, Tass said. Tass
did not saw how many ships were in the second group.
   The icebreakers are expected to arrive Tuesday afternoon, Col.
Tom Carroll of the Alaska National Guard, which is taking part in
the rescue effort, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today.
   In Washington today, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said the Admiral Makarov could arrive as early as tonight.
   It was unclear what good the icebreakers could do in the shallow
water near the whales. The ships need 39 feet of water to operate,
Tass said, and the whales were trapped in water 12 to 25 feet deep.
   Even if the icebreakers cannot reach the whales, the ships could
help clear a path to open water about 200 miles away, Petersen said.
   As high-tech heavy equipment poured into this whaling village
during the weekend, Eskimos used chain saws and muscle to make the
most progress toward freeing the animals.
   ``We're marching out to the lead with Inupiat (Eskimo) power,''
said Morris. ``The whales are responding to the holes.''
   The breathing holes extend more than 1{ miles from where the
whales were first trapped.
   The Eskimos connected several holes, converting them into a
narrow pool 250 feet long to give the whales more room to rest.
They made a similar slot in the ice over a shoal about 5 feet deep.
The shoal apparently deterred the whales from moving farther toward
open water.
   The whales appeared to be in good health, although a patch of
skin torn off one animal's snout appeared to be worsening, said Jim
Harvey, Withrow's colleague.
   Biologists believe a bone infection may have contributed to the
death of the smallest whale, which had been named Bone.
   The surviving whales were named Crossbeak and Bonnet by
biologists. Eskimos have named the survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, or ice hole. The vanished whale was named Knik, or snowflake.
   Wind continued blowing from a more northerly direction Sunday,
threatening to close the lead in the ice that rescuers were trying
to move the whales to.
   The airlift will have to be considered if the pressure ridge
cannot be breached, biologists said.
   ``It's been done numerous times with killer whales and the
like,'' Harvey said as he and Withrow tried to accurately measure
the whales' lenghth.
   The whales were estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, the smaller a
yearling and the other 2 to 3 years old, Withrow said.
   ``Getting them in the net will be tricky,'' Withrow said.
   The icebreakers were dispatched under a 1976 cooperative
environmental agreement with the Soviets, NOAA spokesman Brian
Gorman said in Washington, D.C.
   NOAA provided satellite photographs of polar ice to the Soviets
to help them map a route to Barrow, the northernmost community in
the United States, Gorman said.

   Two young whales trapped by ice
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water Sunday that
was being carved with chain saws by Eskimos who ordinarily hunt
whales.
   A National Guard helicopter hammered at the ice off Alaska's
northern coast with a 5-ton chunk of concrete. But the whales were
more than three miles from a strech of open water, with a massive
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice
around them and trap them further.
   Rescuers said that even if everything went as planned, it would
be at least Wednesday night before they could get the whales as far
as the ridge.
   As crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked for help from
two Soviet icebreakers.
   The icebreakers, Admiral Makorov and Vladimir Arseniev, however,
need about 39 feet of water to operate, the Soviet news agency TASS
reported. The whales are trapped in an area where water depth
varies from 12 to 25 feet.
   NOAA Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen, director of the Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle, said even if the icebreakers cannot reach
the whales, they could help clear a path to the first opening, or
lead, from open water 200 miles away.
   Petersen said that depending on ice conditions, the ships could
reach Barrow by noon Tuesday.
   While high-technology equipment poured into Barrow during the
weekend, Eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the
most progress at freeing the California gray whales from a tiny
breathing hole.
   About two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes Saturday, for
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1{ miles from where
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before
they could migrate south.
   The smallest and youngest of the whales, named Bone, disappeared
Friday night and was presumed dead.
   Just as the tedious hole-cutting hit its stride, the whales
balked, advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening
where they spent Friday night and most of Saturday.
   Biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing
holes, sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface. They
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are
freed.
   ``If they know they are capable of doing that, they may continue
doing so,'' said biologist Jim Harvey.
   ``Basically, we have to condition them that their best chance of
survival is to move ahead to new holes,'' Harvey said.
   He said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes
behind the whales to force them along the desired path.
   Rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an
underwater shoal. North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep, compared to
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal.
   ``You figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale, and that
doesn't leave them too much room to swim,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
blame them for not wanting to go through there.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower, whose crew used donated chain
saws to help free the animals, was frustrated by the whales'
reluctance.
   ``If we move them, then I'll call it progress,'' Brower said,
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the
direction he wanted it to go.
   Ron Morris, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said sonar would be used to see if
there is an easy way around the shoal.
   The surviving whales appeared to be healthy, immature whales
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, said David Withrow of the Marine
Mammal Institute in Seattle. He said one apparently was a yearling
and the other was 2 to 3 years old.
   Rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights, snowmobile
headlights and de-icing equipment dubbed ``the bubblers'' to keep
the holes open ahead of the whales.
   The Skycrane helicopter on Saturday used its concrete plunger to
probe the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house, but the
battering ram seldom penetrated. The ridge formed by colliding ice
masses is several hundred yards wide.
   Of additional concern was a shift in the wind, which Eskimo
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into
an impassable jumble of ice rubble.
   NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman in Washington, D.C., said the agency
asked for the Soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said the rescue effort also involves use of ``some of our own
NOAA satellites to take ice pictures. We are relaying that
information to the Soviets to assist them in determining the most
expeditious route.''
   Heavy ice in the Arctic Ocean earlier disabled two Canadian
icebreakers and the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star.
   The latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle
is a pontoon-mounted vehicle known as an Archimedes screw, which
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice.
   While marine biologists called the whales Bone, Crossbeak and
Bonnet, the Eskimos have named the two survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, ice hole. The vanished whale they named Knik, one of 28
Eskimo words for snowflake.
   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration
to the warm water off Mexico's Baja California, Withrow said.
   Harvey and Withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of
survival if they can be freed within a week.
   Harvey said the whales condition Sunday appeared stable, but
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than
before.
   The rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct
traffic.
   A giant Air Force C5-A cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment
took up so much ground space at Barrow's airport that a commercial
flight didn't have room to land.

   The outcome of the two-week effort to free
two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals
faced 200 miles of ice-clogged waters on the way to their winter
home.
   Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.
   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,
said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the
animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator
Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from
tracking a pair of young, lost whales.
   But hopes were high they would survive. ``They had the will to
live. They should make it,'' Morris said.
   The whales on Friday reluctantly took advantage of an escape
route from Alaska's ice-bound northern coast afforded them by an
alliance of groups that are often at odds with each other: Eskimo
whalers, the military, the oil industry, environmentalists, the
Soviet Union and the North Slope Borough, a countylike government.
   The Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev made four runs late
Thursday through the last 300 yards of ice between open water and
the manmade breathing holes where the whales were resting when
darkness fell.
   On its final run during the night, the Arseniev reported that one
whale entered the channel the ship had left in its wake.
   But when Eskimos checked on the whales Friday morning, they still
were in the last breathing hole. The Eskimos were prepared to resume
leading the whales to open water by cutting more holes with chain
saws.
   Then the whales disappeared.
   ``They were looking good,'' North Slope Borough Mayor George
Ahmaogak said after the last sighting of the animals.
   It was several hours after dawn Friday before rescuers could take
to the air to confirm the whales were gone. No trace of them was
found, which was interpreted favorably.
   Morris said he believed the whales were on their way, saying
there was at least three miles of open water in the direction they
had to go to resume their annual migration to Baja California.
   Originally, three whales were found trapped by an early freeze.
They were discovered Oct. 13 after being stuck in the ice off Point
Barrow about a week. One disappeared Oct. 21 nearly five miles from
open water and is presumed dead.
   The surviving whales, named Crossbeak and Bonnet by rescuers,
were bleeding from cuts and abrasions late Thursday.
   Questions were raised about the whales' apparent dependence on
man's help and their attraction to the noise of the chain saws. But
Harvey said he expected the whales to revert quickly to their
natural behavior.
   Gray whales generally migrate within sight of land, usually no
more than three miles offshore, Harvey said.
   Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service said that might
present a problem, since the ice near shore was more solid than the
ice farther out.
   ``It's going to force them out,'' Hufford said. ``What that's
going to do to them, we don't know.''
   Because the whales no longer can rely on the regularly spaced
breathing holes provided by the Eskimos, they would have to be
willing to search out random openings in the unstructured and
constantly changing ice ahead of them, Hufford added.
   With the population of California gray whales estimated at more
than 20,000 and growing, marine mammal experts here said there is no
scientific reason for special efforts to save the whales, even
though they are considered endangered.
   David Withrow, a whale specialist from the government's Marine
Mammal Laboratory, said the species may actually be better off
without these two whales because they were not clever enough to
migrate in the right direction at the right time.
   In the time that United States' northernmost community became the
focus of worldwide attention, native craftsmen geared up to meet the
demand for souvenirs. The whale saga also spawned a T-shirt
industry, with at least three commemorative logos marketed.

   One of three trapped whales was presumed
dead Saturday, but its companions inched toward open water as
Eskimos cut a string of breathing holes and a helicopter battering
ram smashed a path through thick ice.
   ``They certainly have a very good fighting chance in their
battle to escape,'' David Withrow, a federal marine mammal
biologist, said Saturday.
   However, a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood in
the way of a breakthrough for the California gray whales, members
of an endangered species. The big marine mammals were about four
miles from open water.
   A second ice-smashing Skycrane cargo helicopter was standing by
two hours away in Prudhoe Bay in case rescuers decided a second
concrete ice-bashing ``bullet'' was needed.
   And at White House direction, the Air Force assigned the largest
aircraft in its inventory _ the C-5A Galaxy _ to ferry more
equipment from Prudhoe Bay to Barrow, Air Force Maj. Doug McCoy
said Saturday.
   The whale nicknamed Bone disappeared beneath the foot-thick ice
Friday afternoon. By midnight Friday, rescuers on the ice near this
small Eskimo town on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope Bone might
rejoin the others.
   North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said the whale was
presumed dead.
   ``Everyone is sorry to hear about the whale, but I don't think
it was totally unexpected,'' Carroll said Saturday. He had told
reporters earlier the whale was the weakest of the three, and had
some respiratory problems.
   Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet became trapped at a small breathing
hole in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during their
annual migration south. Open water was too far away for them to
reach it without surfacing to breathe.
   The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had
been rubbed to the bone by the rough ice surrounding the breathing
hole. That condition may have led to Bone's death, said biologist
Craig George.
   ``Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' George
said.
   The whale's body probably sank to the bottom but may float in a
few days because of gases from decomposition, George said. ``We'll
either find it or a (polar) bear will,'' he said. Polar bears feed
on whale carcasses.
   Something will have to be done about the ice ridge, and soon, if
the remaining whales are to be freed, said Col. Tom Carroll, in
charge of the Alaska National Guard's two Skycrane helicopters on
loan for the rescue.
   ``We looked for an alternate route (bypassing the ridge) and
didn't find it,'' he said. ``If there's no way through it, it will
have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways from
it.''
   The ridge lies about a quarter-mile from an area of open water
leading to the open sea.
   The ridge was believed to be too thick to be punctured by the
helicopters' five-ton, steel-reinforced concrete hammers, and local
ice specialists were assessing the situation Saturday, said Geoff
Carroll. ``I think we're going to blast,'' he said.
   Bone disappeared about the same time rescuers had their greatest
success.
   About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale
hunters, led the whales almost a half-mile closer to open water
Friday by using chain saws to carve a string of 10-by-30-foot
breathing holes. They continued carving holes on Saturday.
   De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water,
freed the Eskimos to work on new holes.
   ``After waiting so long for high tech equipment, it's the local
people who have kind of taken over and made some progress,''
Carroll said.
   The whales, meanwhile, were swimming from hole to hole,
apparently responding to efforts to lead them to open water,
biologists said.
   ``Their swimming patterns now are about what you'd expect them
to be,'' said Withrow, who is from Seattle.
   Biologists removed a de-icing machine from the whales' original
hole late Friday and started one of the machines in the most
distant new hole. They also shined a bright light in the farthest
hole.
   In a matter of minutes, the whales popped up in that hole,
touching off a chorus of cheers from people on the ice.
   Rescuers shoveled snow and ice into the original hole Friday
evening in an effort to seal it and discourage the whales from
returning. But late Friday, they did just that, nosing up through
the slush.
   ``That's OK,'' Morris said. ``It's just a little retrogression.
We're in good shape.''
   The first huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard
worked in the opposite direction from the Eskimo crews, working
from the open water back toward the whales, so as not to frighten
the mammals.
   The aircraft, designed to haul heavy cargo, used a concrete
block suspended from its cargo hook to punch four 15- to 20-foot
holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals.
   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the
`bullet,''' said Spec. 4 Wade Palmer, a Guard spokesman. ``It drops
through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back
out.''
   The second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort
to drag a 185-ton, icebreaking ``hover-barge'' 230 miles from the
oil fields at Prudhoe Bay.
   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen to
about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the
past decade, officials said.
   The whales spend their winters in the warm water off Mexico's
Baja California and Southern California and summer in the food-rich
northern seas.

   The massive rescue effort to save two California gray whales
won't make a difference to the survival of the species, but it's
been a public relations dream for environmentalists trying to rouse
the world to save its oceans.
   ``What's the big deal? I don't know. It all of a sudden
exploded,'' said Howard Braham, director of the National Marine
Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, the chief U.S. research center on
whales.
   ``Only the individual can answer if it's worth it,'' Braham said.
``We're dealing with the human spirit. We allow some awfully damning
things to go unchecked and then we reach out to something with a
tear in our eye.''
   The leviathan rescue has thrown together an unlikely army of
would-be saviors: whale-hunting Eskimos, Greenpeace
environmentalists, oil companies, the U.S. and Soviet governments,
wildlife experts, animal behavior specialists and chainsaw
mechanics. An international cast of some 40 to 60 reporters keeps
the world informed of any progress.
   The two surviving gray whales imprisoned by the ice are part of
an endangered species, meaning they are thought to be in imminent
danger of becoming extinct.
   But the population of grays is flourishing. There are about
21,000, which is near the historic peak of 25,000 reached before
whale hunters slaughtered all but a few thousand around the turn of
the century.
   The Soviets kill 169 gray whales each year to feed Eskimos under
an exemption granted by the International Whaling Commission, and
another 1,000 animals die of natural causes yearly, according to
government estimates.
   Despite the losses, the population of grays increases by 2.5
percent a year, and the deaths of three wayward whales not yet old
enough to breed would be insignificant, scientists said.
   ``There's no loss from a biological standpoint,'' said research
biologist David Withrow from the National Marine Mammal Laboratory.
   But cold facts have no chance against heated emotions when human
nature fights Mother Nature.
   The whales have names. Biologists call the two survivors Bonnet
and Crossbeak. The Inupiat Eskimos who discovered them Oct. 7 call
them Putu and Siku for Ice Hole and Ice. A third whale, Bone or
Kanik for Snowflake, apparently died Friday.
   Television brought the whales into U.S. homes. Nightly pictures
of their battered and bleeding snouts protruding from a breathing
hole cut like a harpoon into American hearts.
   ``These animals are turning out to be ambassadors for all marine
life,'' said Susan Vernon of the Whale Museum in Friday Harbor,
Wash. ``I don't think it's overreaction. It's a catharsis. The
helping hand was extended. And it was extended in good faith.''
   Gray whales feed in the icy Arctic Ocean, then migrate 7,000
miles to breed off balmy Baja California. The three trapped whales
were migrating for the first time.
   Even experienced bowhead whales, equipped with thick skulls to
break through ice, get hemmed in. About 10 to 12 of them perish each
year off northern Alaska, biologists said.
   Some have questioned the expense of trying to save the whales _
which had reached upward of $600,000 and counting as of Monday _
while funding for U.S. whale research has been cut. The annual
budget for the National Marine Mammal Laboratory is $2 million, down
from $2.8 million in 1985.
   ``However much money they're spending on the rescue is fine,''
said Patty Warhol, director of the American Cetacean Society in San
Pedro, Calif.
   ``That money might be better used in research, but you just can't
buy that kind of public relations for whales,'' she said. ``Today,
there are people all over the country talking about whales who two
weeks ago didn't know they existed or thought they were big fish.''
   The mercy mission has melted hearts of grizzled oil field
roustabouts from the bone-chilling North Slope, who also have reaped
a public relations harvest of good will for their labors.
   VECO Inc. of Prudhoe Bay offered to send a 185-ton ice
pulverizing hoverbarge to smash a pathway to the sea, with ARCO
Alaska Inc. donating fuel to the Alaska National Guard helicopter
that tried vainly to coax it to the whales. The barge got stuck in
shallow water.
   ``It was a common cause to help the underdog. We're human too,''
said Marvin King, operations manager for VECO. ``It's not money.
It's not headlines. We wanted to do what we could to help another
mammal.''
   ``We did what we should have done,'' said Ben Odom, senior vice
president of ARCO Alaska. ``It's a sad sight to see them struggling
to stay alive. What's that worth to help them? We're not discouraged
by the naysayers.''

<TEXT>
   Favorable winds Thursday buoyed hopes for
three whales trapped in Arctic ice as a huge military helicopter
again headed out to slowly drag an icebreaking barge from Prudhoe
Bay.
   While the whales still were 200 miles away from the open water
of the Chukchi Sea, an easterly wind was breaking leads, or
pathways, in the vast expanse of pack ice near the whales, said
Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service. It was pushing the
ice east and north, away from shore, and the forecast called for
east winds and a slight warming trend until Tuesday.
   ``But weather is an unpredictable beast,'' Hufford said.
   A satellite photograph Thursday showed the ice was cracking open
all over the Arctic Ocean and Chukchi Sea, Hufford said, but
sub-zero temperatures were quickly freezing any open water.
   The animals were trapped about 100 yards off the desolate Arctic
Ocean coast about two weeks ago by bitter cold and the constantly
shifting ice pack. They have been breathing through small air holes
about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo village.
   While biologists earlier worried that the animals were fading,
they said the giant mammals' respiration rates have stablilized.
   ``You can set your watch by them _ every 10 minutes,'' said
Craig George, a North Slope Borough biologist.
   Biologists named the whales Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone _ the
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice. Eskimos
have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole) and
Kanik (Snowflake).
   The whales were at least three miles from the nearest lead, and
whether they would make it to open water was uncertain.
   ``Whether they will be able to navigate lead-to-lead to get to
the open water, I don't know,'' said Ted Meyers, National Marine
Fisheries Service chief of habitat conservation in Alaska. ``They
must go through areas of ice for some distance before they reach
open sea.''
   At the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, a huge Army National Guard
Skycrane helicopter lifted off after first light and prepared to
hook onto the 185-ton barge and begin the 230-mile journey to the
whales. The trip was expected to take 25-40 hours. That means the
barge could not arrive at Point Barrow before sometime Friday.
   The helicopter and propulsionless barge progressed only five
miles Wednesday before the operation was halted because of
darkness. The rescue effort had been delayed more than two days by
freezing weather, equipment repairs and mud bogging down the barge,
which had to be relieved of excess weight.
   The Army National Guard said a second Skycrane assigned to the
towing mission may be diverted to lift a 9,000-pound reinforced
concrete cylinder to Barrow where it will be used to smash holes
through the ice.
   ``They are not going to send it to Barrow until they are sure
they will not need it here,'' said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswoman for
the Alaska National Guard at Prudhoe Bay.
   Two generator-powered de-icers provided by a Minnesota family
business were keeping the whales' breathing holes clear, allowing
biologists and whalers to take a break. They had been using
chainsaws around the clock to keep the holes open.
   The 24- to 30-foot-long California gray whales, whose species is
endangered, became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating
south. The species, which numbers about 20,000 and has been growing
at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, spends
winters in the warm waters off Mexico and Southern California.

   Two whales trapped for more than two weeks
by encircling Arctic ice apparently swam to freedom before daylight
today, after days of effort by Eskimos and icebreakers, an official
said.
   ``They were last seen at 8:45 a.m. They were looking good,''
North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak said after talking by
radio to Eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the
whales. The last sighting was about an hour before sunrise.
   ``I feel great. I feel like I got no more burden,'' said Arnold
Brower, the senior whaling captin who directed the Eskimo rescue
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chain saws.
   Asked if he was confident the two California gray whales swam to
freedom, actually open channels in the ice leading to ice-free water
200 miles away, rather than died, Brower replied: ``Yes.'' A third
whale disappeared a week ago and was presumed dead.
   As night fell Thursday in sub-zero temperatures, rescuers had
left the whales in a breathing hole just 330 yards from open water,
a distance that federal whale biologist David Withrow called
``essentially one long dive.''
   Twice Wednesday, the giant mammals traveled more than 300 yards
under the ice to reach new breathing holes, he said. But they
appeared reluctant to traverse the distance Thursday.
   The Eskimos crews had gone out early today to cut additional
holes to coax the animals toward the open water, said Ahmaogak.
   The whales' condition appeared worse after they struggled through
the slush and ice left in the icebreakers' wake Wednesday night and
Thursday. Both bled from multiple but superficial cuts.
   The Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev and its companion ship,
the Admiral Makarov, had remained nearby and offered to lend further
assistance by cutting a second path through the ice off the northern
Alaska coast. The ships then planned to depart for their home port
of Vladivostok.
   Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said the Soviet crews were ``ready to go
home.'' Their ships had been at sea for nearly six months and were
diverted for the last three days to assist the whale-rescue effort.
   ``We're here until those whales depart from the area,'' Ron
Morris, the rescue coordinator, said before the whales disappeared
early today. He said that if it was evident the whales had reached
open water, then ``that's all we're going to do ... the whales are
on their own.''
   The whales were caught in the arctic ice for nearly three weeks
by an early freeze, halting their annual migration to their winter
home off Baja California.
   The mammals' plight triggered a massive rescue effort involving
chain saw-wielding Eskimos and the Soviet icebreakers that captured
worldwide attention. The effort has cost an estimated $1.3 million.
   Rescuers thought that after the icebreakers broke a channel to
open water Wednesday the whales would resume their migration. But
the pair lingered and parts of the channel refroze.
   The eventual fate of the creatures may never be known because
scientists turned down the option of attaching radio transmitters to
them. Some rescuers said they'd rather not know what happens to them.
   The temperature hovered at minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit Thursday
night, quickly refreezing escape channels cut by the Arseniev. The
plunging temperatures also were beginning to put a glaze of ice on
the open water to which rescuers were trying to lead the whales.
   National Weather Service ice analyst Gary Hufford said the whales
had shown an ability to break newly formed ice, so he remained
optimistic they could survive if they got beyond the remnants of the
pressure ridge crushed earlier in the week by the Soviet icebreakers.
   When rescuers found the whales early Thursday, they were
maintaining a small breathing hole about 1{ miles from where they
were last seen Wednesday night.
   Concerned with the whales' inability to negotiate the partially
refrozen channel, Eskimo laborers cut more than three dozen new
breathing holes in a path toward open water. The whales followed
dutifully, and were resting in the last breathing hole when darkness
fell.
   The Eskimos were prevented from moving further because the ice
was unstable as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts.

   Soviet icebreakers, trying to help rescue two
whales off Barrow, Alaska, also were involved in a whale rescue off
Eastern Siberia three years ago, an American official involved in
joint U.S.-Soviet ocean research said Monday.
   In 1985, Soviet icebreakers broke through an ice barrier in the
Gulf of Anadyr trying to free several dozen beluga whales, said
Robert V. Miller, deputy director of the National Marine Laboratory
in Seattle.
   ``Reports are mixed, but I think they did get some out,'' Miller
said in a telephone interview.
   Unlike the Barrow whales, trapped under the ice, the Anadyr
whales were in a small area of water that was cut off from the
ocean by a ring of ice. Icebreakers had to break through the ring.
Belugas are smaller than the California gray whales off Barrow,
typically 15 feet long compared with 50 feet.
   Miller said he did not know whether the Soviet vessels involved
in the Barrow attempt were also involved at Anadyr.
   The Gulf of Anadyr is in the western Bering Sea south of the
Chukchi peninsula, the easternmost portion of Siberia.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been cooperating on
whale and other marine mammal research in the northern Pacific,
Bering Sea and Arctic Oceans since 1973 under the U.S.-Soviet
treaty on environmental protection.
   They have conducted at least 15 joint research cruises, and
scientists from the two countries visit each other's laboratories
about twice a year, Miller said.
   Though the icebreakers at Barrow were not part of the research
agreement, the willingness of the Soviet Union to lend a hand shows
that its scientists are ``very much interested in marine mammals
and conservation of these animals,'' Miller said.

   Faced with thickening ice, plunging
temperatures and the imminent departure of two Soviet icebreakers,
rescuers late Thursday made a last-ditch effort to free two whales
threatened again by the arctic icepack.
   The California gray whales, freed from nearly three weeks
confinement in their icebound breathing hole off Point Barrow, moved
closer to open water via man-made breathing holes and channels cut
in the ice by the Soviet ships.
   But as night fell Thursday, the whales were in the last breathing
hole cut for them, with about 300 meters of ice between the hole and
open water, said rescue coordinator Ron Morris.
   Temperatures Thursday hovered around 15 degrees below zero and
were expected to drop to minus 20 to 25 degrees below overnight,
cold enough to begin freezing over the adjoining open water of the
Arctic Ocean.
   Rescuers left a portable generator to power de-icing equipment at
the whale's last breathing hole and light a beacon for the
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev, which was to make two or three final
runs to try to free the whales.
   ``This should free them,'' Morris said. ``Hopefully, the whales
will see the opportunity to leave. We've given them the best shot
tonight.'' Morris said the Soviets had to leave Thursday night.
   The plunging temperatures quickly refroze the channels the
icebreaker had made earlier Thursday. Eskimos broke out chain saws
and cut dozens more breathing holes leading away from the clogged
channel toward the open sea.
   By nightfall, the workers were encountering dangerously unstable
ice as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts.
   As they did Wednesday, the whales readily followed the path cut
for them by the Eskimos. As night fell, they had advance as far as
the last breathing hole.
   In a new tactic, rescuers carved 30 new holes Thursday in hopes
that the whales would follow the holes away from the channel and
eventually reach open water via another route the Soviet ships were
clearing.
   ``They're ready to go home'' after nearly six months at sea, said
Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. ``We felt also with the weather creeping in like
this, we had to do something tonight.''
   Everyone hopes that when daylight arrives Friday, both the
Soviets and the whales will be gone, Petersen said.
   NOAA ice analyst Gary Huffard said the open water was definitely
beginning to freeze, but he remained optimistic that the whales
could escape if they could get beyond the edge of the pressure ridge
battered down by the icebreakers earlier in the week.
   Eskimos with chain saws had cut a series of breathing holes that
allowed the whales to swim well away from the original hole to which
they had been confined.
   The whales grew accustomed to the cutting and during a frenzy of
work Wednesday, in which 50 new holes were cut, the whales
repeatedly surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice
was removed.
   Since the whales were accustomed to the noise of the saws, that
sound might be used to coax them forward toward open water, said
Morris, a biologist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The Eskimos eventually worked the marine mammals to within a
quarter-mile of a channel carved through the 18-inch-thick ice by
two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Then the
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev reopened the partially frozen channel.
   The man-made channel, aimed at guiding the whales to an natural
open ``lead'' through the ice and eventually to open water,
partially refroze during the night, Morris said.
   He said the whales were ``conditioning themselves back to
reality'' after nearly three weeks of confinement in the ice off the
coast near Point Barrow.
   He also announced a crackdown on access to the whales by
reporters and others. He said pilots entering restricted air space
over the whales were subject to fines of $25,000.
   A biologist for the North Slope Borough, Geoff Carroll, said
Thursday that the whales continued to appear healthy.
   The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in
the rescue that cost more than $800,000 didn't attach radio
transmitters to the whales to track them, in part because of concern
that the devices would only add to their stress, said federal marine
mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago
apparently died last week.
   The endangered California gray whales have one of the longest
migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from summer
feeding grounds in the Arctic to the warm water off Baja California.
   Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual
average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said.

   Eskimo whalers wielding chain saws donated
by an oil company cut new breathing holes for three beleaguered
whales trapped two weeks in thick ice near the top of the world.
   The Eskimos on Tuesday cut three holes 75 yards apart in a line
leading away from the larger of two small breathing pools the
California gray whales have used since being stranded in the
Beaufort Sea while migrating south.
   The rescuers, who received a telephone pep talk Tuesday from
President Reagan, hope the new holes will influence the endangered
mammals to move in the direction they must travel if they are ever
to escape their icy corral.
   ``It'll be interesting to see if it works,'' North Slope Borough
biologist Craig George said as he dodged the slushy spray from
chain saws chewing through foot-deep ice 18 miles northeast of this
Inupiat Eskimo community. By Tuesday night, the whales hadn't moved
to the new holes, officials said.
   Standard Oil of Alaska donated three chain saws, and planned to
send a digging machine by helicopter to speed the work.
   Meanwhile, a long-shot attempt to free the whales with an
icebreaking barge was delayed until today.
   Two Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopters have been
rigged to tow the 185-ton hovercraft barge from Prudhoe Bay, an oil
field about 200 miles southeast, in a tricky trip across Arctic
Ocean ice.
   The trip, which is expected to take 25 to 40 hours, was to have
started Monday or Tuesday, but was delayed when the barge got stuck
and was slowed again by refueling. Plans to get under way shortly
after daylight today were also put off, but rescuers were still
working through the morning and hoped to leave at about noon.
   Overnight, workers labored to decrease the amount of fuel on the
barge to reduce its weight by 70 tons.
   Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer Tom Williams, a
helicopter copilot, said they hoped the barge, now that it's so
much lighter, wouldn't get bogged down in ``a goopy mess'' of mud
underneath ice close to shore, as it had Tuesday.
   ``The barge doesn't operate well unless it's over water or ice.
It started blowing mud out the sides and bogged down,'' he said
today as workers began getting ready for another try.
   By midmorning Alaska time, the National Guard office in Prudhoe
Bay said the much-delayed rescue mission was now scheduled to get
under way about noon (4 p.m. EDT), but few details of the morning's
efforts at the site were available. National Guard spokesman Mike
Haller had said earlier that if the barge could not be moved by
about noon today, officials would consider alternatives.
   Officials hoped to use the barge to carve a 40-foot path to open
water and freedom for the whales. The barge pulverizes ice with its
bulk and the fans that provide lift.
   Leads in the ice that were as close as five miles last weekend
have been plugged by shifting winds, record low temperatures and
drifting ice. By Tuesday night the nearest open water was believed
to be 100 miles away, officials said.
   The rescue effort, complicated by the harsh arctic conditions,
has become a race against time.
   The young whales are tired, and at least one has pneumonia.
Their barnacle-encrusted snouts have been worn raw from grating on
the jagged ice surrounding the breathing holes. The animals were in
shallow water only a few hundred feet from shore.
   Last week, ice around the holes was so thin biologists did not
dare walk on it. By Tuesday, with a record low temperature of minus
13 degrees, the ice was 18 to 24 inches thick.
   The whales are 24 to 30 feet long, but have shown no inclination
to smash their way to freedom.
   Their plight has drawn international attention.
   On Tuesday, Reagan telephoned Army National Guard Col. Tom
Carroll, commander of the rescue, to wish him well.
   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' Reagan
told Carroll, who was at the helicopter staging area at Prudhoe
Bay. ``Anything that we can say or do to help you along with the
success of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it.'' Biologists
said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown in the whale
drama. Scores of people have called with ideas to free the mammals,
such as using explosives, dropping bowling balls to break the ice,
or netting the whales for transport elsewhere.
   ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by
the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said George.
   But Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries said this case
is different. The whales are a little more than 100 yards from
shore and are easily viewed.
   ``It's simple. It happens every time with whales ... with any
marine mammals,'' Morris said. ``They're portrayed as gentle
creatures and the situation out there (on the ice) is sad; it's
really sad.''

   Animal rights activists picketed New England
Aquarium on Saturday over its proposal to send an antisocial
dolphin to a top-secret Navy research center, but the aquarium
director said no decision has been made.
   Rainbow, an 11-year-old, 8-foot-2, 450-pound male, blue-gray
bottlenose dolphin would be swapped for a partly deaf female in the
Navy's secret underwater mammal program at the Naval Ocean Systems
Center in San Diego.
   ``We are vehemently opposed to any dolphin being given to the
Navy under any circumstances,'' said Doreen Close, a spokeswoman
for the Boston Marine Mammal Coalition. ``Once they get into the
Navy's hands, we have no way of knowing what happens to them.''
   John H. Prescott, the aquarium's executive director, said public
concern over Rainbow's future has led him to reconsider the trade.
   About 60 members of the coalition and other activists peacefully
picketed the aquarium, protesting the proposed swap of the dolphins.
   ``We capture them, we use them, we abuse them, then we dump
them,'' said Richard O'Barry, a former trainer of the dolphins on
the 1960s television series ``Flipper.'' He was not affiliated with
the marine mammal coalition.
   Aquarium officials say Rainbow is too aggressive and has become
less compatible with other dolphins at the aquarium as he has
matured.
   The Naval Ocean Systems Center studies and trains 142 marine
mammals, 109 of which are dolphins, in underwater surveillance and
detecting and marking objects for recovery. Further details on the
center's purpose are classified.
   Prescott said the swap was considered because the Navy could use
Rainbow's sonar and hearing for its research, while the partly deaf
female from the center would be suitable with those at the aquarium.
   O'Barry said dolphins in captivity are abused simply by being
placed inside steel or concrete tanks. They become ill and
stressed, he said.
   ``You can't take a sonic creature and put it in a steel box.
It's different from every other animal in that aquarium,'' he said.
``They are animals of sound.''
   In May, a former trainer of the Navy center alleged that the
Navy was training bottlenose dolphins with .45-caliber guns mounted
on their snouts to kill enemy frogmen. Officials at the center
denied those claims.
   A federal Marine Mammal Commission probe found no major problems
with the center's program or dolphin deaths in the past 13 months.
That probe was initiated because of reports in 1988 that 13
dolphins in the Navy had died between 1986 and 1988.
   ``Any dolphin in the world is in more danger from swimming into
drift nets than (from) any training program of the Navy,'' said
Kathy Krieger, curator of marine mammals at the aquarium.
   She said NOSC research has helped aquariums in caring for their
dolphins and whales.

   Two gray whales that were stranded in
arctic ice for nearly three weeks apparently swam to freedom Friday,
ending a million-dollar rescue effort watched around the world.
   ``There is no evidence of the whales in the immediate area,''
rescue coordinator Ron Morris said. ``I think the whales are
definitely gone.''
   North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak said the whales were
last seen at 8:45 a.m.
   ``They were looking good,'' Ahmaogak said after talking by radio
to Eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the whales. The
last sighting was about an hour before sunrise. Ahmaogak later made
an observation flight over 15 miles of the coastline south and west
of Barrow.
   ``I feel great. I feel like I got no more burden,'' said Arnold
Brower, the senior whaling captain who directed the Eskimo rescue
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chainsaws.
   Asked if he was confident the two gray whales swam to freedom,
rather than died, Brower replied: ``Yes.''
   Morris called the whales' survival chances ``pure speculation.
They had the will to live. They should make it.''
   Whether the whales survive probably will never be known because
biologists chose not to tag them with radio transmitters to keep
track of them.
   Brower said he was confident the two whales had reached the
channel cut by two Soviet icebreakers.
   If the California gray whales followed the icebreaker's channel,
they would still have to navigate ``leads,'' natural breaks in the
ice that vary greatly in width and close or open according to the
wind, about 200 miles to open ocean.
   Biologist Howard Braham, director of National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Mammal Laboratory in
Seattle, said he thought the whales could make the 200-mile journey
if they would get moving.
   ``This is an open water species, basically, and for whatever
reason, being in the ice is new to them,'' he said. ``They are not
adapted for it anatomically. They are in unfamiliar territory.''
   The icebreakers spent much of the night plowing through the ice
off Alaska's northern coast to slice another escape route for the
whales, originally trapped at a small breathing hole four miles from
open water. A third whale trapped with them died earlier.
   The Arseniev and the larger Admiral Makarov had been expected at
first light to head for their home port of Vladivostok. But their
crews reported they could stay to help, rescuers said.
   Rescuers had thought that after the Soviet ships smashed a
channel to open water earlier this week, the relatively young marine
mammals would have resumed their migration south. But at first they
did not move, and parts of the channel refroze.
   The temperature early Friday was 14 degrees below zero.
   When last seen late Thursday, the whales' condition appeared
worse after they had struggled through the slush and ragged ice left
in the icebreakers' wake Wednesday night and Thursday. Both bled
from multiple but superficial cuts.
   ``I think if they can stay in the small cracks and open leads
that are frequent on the front of the pack ice, frequently that ice
is thinner, and if they don't make wrong turns, they should make it
out. Still, they have some rough going,'' Braham said. ``They may
make mistakes.''

   Soviet icebreakers today neared two whales
trapped in the high Arctic as rescuers prepared ``Operation
Breakthrough,'' a go-for-broke attempt to smash through an ice wall
blocking the animals' path to open seas.
   The vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of Point
Barrow before first light in Barrow, about noon EDT, said Coast
Guard spokesman Ken Freeze in Alameda, Calif. A helicopter was being
prepared to take representatives of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Coast guard to the ship, along
with an interpreter, Freeze said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Moscow, said the
larger of the two icrebreakers, the Admiral Makarov, had been slowed
by heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200
yards.
   Meanwhile, ice experts were trying to find a way through the
pressure ridge and rescuers were trying to coax the whales over a
shoal between them and ridge. The whales retreated from the shoal
Monday.
   Anticipating the imminent arrival of two Soviet icebreakers, the
ice specialists were taking soundings Monday of the water depth on
either side of the ridge, a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 200
yards wide and some 30 feet high.
   The skipper of a U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker assigned to act as
liaison with the Soviets and a National Weather Service analyst were
among those looking for a place where the icebreaker could punch
through the ridge.
   The California gray whales must get through the icy tangle if
they are to reach an open lead, or pathway, through the ice.
   The whales, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeks
ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of Barrow, were about
four miles from the ice ridge. A third whale disappeared Friday and
is presumed dead.
   ``It's discouraging,'' federal biologist David Withrow said
Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has
stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. ``Why
come back here when they know it's open up there?''
   The California gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly
as they poked their way through large slabs of Beaufort Sea ice and
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom.
   At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood oozed
from a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining the
water.
   Biologists called a temporary halt to opening new breathing holes
so the whales would have a chance to rest and perhaps seek the open
water on their own.
   Rescue coordinator Ron Morris of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration remained optimistic.
   ``They always regress some before they learn,'' Morris said of
the whales. ``They'll move.''
   Meanwhile, specialists determined through soundings that there is
about 40 feet of water beneath the pressure ridge, a jumbled mass of
ice chunks about 30 feet high and as wide as two football fields.
   ``There is a lot of water flowing beneath the ridge, which should
mean it will be easier (for the Soviet icebreakers) to break
through'' than had been expected, Morris said.
   The icebreakers Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev were
expected to arrive this morning. The Soviet help was requested by
the U.S. government and the environmental group Greenpeace.
   The whales must make their way through the ridge if they are to
reach a lead, or pathway, through the ice. The nearest open water is
200 miles away in the Chukchi Sea.
   Breaching the ridge won't do any good if the whales can't be
coaxed past the shoal. The animals, stranded about 100 yards
offshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice 13 miles northeast
of Barrow, were four miles from the ridge. A third whale, which
disappeared Friday, is presumed dead.
   A shift in tactics Monday proved disappointing.
   Eskimos connected a series of breathing holes to form a single
open channel about 600 yards long. Instead of pushing the broken ice
back under the ice sheet, they used long poles to guide it toward
the rear of the slot.
   The idea was to keep the whales from heading back. Initially, it
worked. The whales swam back and forth between the shoal's edge and
the rear of the channel.
   But when the channel behind them was nearly filled, the whales
turned back.
   About 12 feet of water lies over the 125-yard-wide shoal, said
biologist Geoff Carroll. The whales have been spending most of the
time in water 17 to 25 feet deep.
   ``As it gets shallower, it feels (to the whales) like they're
beaching themselves,'' said Jim Harvey, a biologist from the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   Officials hope at least one of the Soviet icebreakers can breach
the ridge, said Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen, director of NOAA's
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   Charts indicate the water at the ridge is about 30 feet deep, and
the 443-foot-long Admiral Makarov needs about 35 feet to operate,
Petersen said. The smaller Vladimir Arseniev needs about 22 feet.
   ``It does seem that the Makorov would have more trouble doing
this,'' he said. ``But they may be able to assist each other. I'm
sure that these vessels, which have operated in the Arctic for
years, have all kinds of solutions to these things.''
   Biologists have a last-ditch option: airlifting the whales to
open water. Withrow emphasized that would be a last resort because
the whales could be injured or traumatized.
   Although rescuers said they were committed to freeing the whales,
the cost of the effort continues to mount.
   Most of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to talk
about the tab but it appears substantial _ at least $600,000 by late
Monday.

<HEAD>Aquarium's Plan to Trade Dolphin to Navy Launches Protest Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aquarium director was reconsidering plans to
trade an aggressive, unsociable show dolphin to the Navy after news
of the deal set off a wave of protests from animal-rights activists.
   The New England Aquarium and the Navy worked out the swap, which
would have enlisted Rainbow, an 11-year-old male, in the secret
underwater mammal program at the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San
Diego.
   Aquarium director John H. Prescott said Wednesday that the angry
public reaction prompted him to rethink the trade.
   ``I think the decision is good for the animals concerned,''
Prescott said. ``(But) if it's causing public concern, I must pay
attention. It's not a closed issue.''
   Rainbow, 8-foot-2 and 450 pounds, is a blue-gray bottlenose
dolphin. One of three show dolphins at the aquarium, it became
cantankerous as it matured.
   Prescott sought a swap: Rainbow for a female.
   Other aquariums refused. But the Navy center, which looks after,
studies and trains 142 marine mammals including 109 dolphins,
eventually agreed to take Rainbow in exchange for a partly deaf
female.
   The center trains dolphins in underwater surveillance and
detecting, locating and marking objects for recovery. Other details
are are classified, said Tom LaPuzza, a spokesman at the San Diego
center.
   The trade was delayed because the military buildup in the
Persian Gulf took Navy planes that could have been used to
transport Rainbow.
   News of the deal got out Thursday, and animal rights activists
raised an outcry.
   ``We have been attempting to persuade the aquarium not to
capture wild dolphins and whales ... Our efforts are more urgent
now that we learn that the aquarium is acting as a clearinghouse
for animals for the military,'' the Boston Marine Mammal Coalition
said in a statement.
   A protest at the aquarium was set for Saturday.
   The aquarium got so many calls it recorded a message to
intercept them, inviting anyone concerned about Rainbow to send a
letter.
   National interest in the Navy dolphins was galvanized by reports
in 1988 that 13 dolphins in Navy training had died between 1986 and
1988. Nearly half the animals suffered from lack of appetite or
stomach ulcers before their deaths, the report said. Other causes
were hepatitis and pneumonia.
   A federal Marine Mammal Commission probe found no major problems
in the program. No Navy animals have died in the past 13 months,
LaPuzza said.
   Then in May, a former trainer told the media that bottlenose
dolphins with .45-caliber guns mounted on their snouts were being
trained by the Navy to kill enemy frogmen.
   LaPuzza denies such claims.
   The Navy has ``never trained marine mammals to kill people and
will never do so,'' LaPuzza said. ``We do not train mammals to
perform operations that will put them in danger.''
   The Navy did use dolphins for military work in Vietnam and in
1986 and 1987 in the Persian Gulf, however, LaPuzza said. He
refused to say what the mammals did. There aren't any immediate
plans to use dolphins in the gulf crisis, he said.
   The aquarium has given the Navy three dolphins since 1980, all
animals it couldn't take for various reasons, Prescott said,
praising the care the military gives the animals.
   The Boston controversy coincides with a similar one in
Washington state. In Silverdale, Wash., Wednesday night the Navy
planned to hear public concerns about the Navy's intention to use
dolphins to guard Trident submarines at Bangor, Wash.
   The hearing is part of a settlement reached after 15 animal
rights groups sued the Navy in April 1989, claiming that bringing
the warm-water dolphins to the colder waters of Hood Canal required
an environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy
Act.
   The suit was dropped when the Navy agreed to make that
assessment.

   In a battle over the best interest of sea mammals, the New
England Aquarium and a group of animal-rights activists are
engaging in a land-mammal ritual: litigation.
   The Boston-based aquarium yesterday sued three
animal-rights groups, seeking $5 million for allegedly false
statements made about the aquarium's handling of dolphins.
The aquarium also accuses the animal-rights activists of
filing meritless lawsuits against it, including another one
last year, in a campaign of harassment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The aquarium's suit presents the latest example of
retaliatory litigation known as SLAPP suits -- Strategic
Lawsuits Against Public Participation -- launched by targets
of activist groups' attacks. Boston attorney David R.
Schmahmann, representing the New England Aquarium, said other
aquariums nationwide, which have also been sued by
animal-rights groups, supported the legal effort.
   The aquarium's suit comes in response to the animal-rights
groups' most recent legal complaint in June challenging the
aquarium's transfer of a dolphin named Kama to a Navy
training program four years ago. The groups claim that, under
federal law, the aquarium should have sought a permit -- and
published its request in the Federal Register -- before
transferring the dolphin. The activists name 10-year-old Kama
as a plaintiff in their suit. The aquarium responds that,
because Kama was born in captivity, no permit is required
under federal law.
   The activist groups, including the Animal Legal Defense
Fund Inc., also argue that the aquarium's program to rescue
beached marine mammals violates the permit law because the
aquarium keeps some of the mammals its saves for research and
display. The aquarium says it complies with federal rules and
that no permit is required for saving beached animals.
   Behind the dispute over the requirements of the federal
Marine Mammal Protection Act lies a far greater disagreement
over whether intelligent sea mammals, such as whales and
dolphins, should be held in captivity at all. Steven Wise, a
Boston attorney for the animal-rights activists, says they
believe that sea mammals are far too sensitive and
intelligent to be placed on display. "They should remain in
the oceans with their families, not in aquariums," he says.
   As part of their campaign, the activist groups distributed
fliers claiming that "Kama . . . was violently removed from
his family group and put into captivity." In 1987, the fliers
said, Kama "was secretly sent to war" at the Naval Ocean
Systems Center, where dolphins are allegedly taught "to plant
dangerous mines or to become lethal dolphin torpedoes."
   The aquarium noted in its lawsuit that Kama wasn't born in
the wild but in captivity, at Sea World in San Diego, and
that the Navy facility was found by a panel of investigators
to treat its sea mammals well and to use them for appropriate
scientific research, such as studies of hearing. Responded
Mr. Wise, the animal-rights lawyer, "The dolphins are used in
a classified military program. The Navy says nothing is going
on. But we choose not to believe the Navy."
   Aquarium officials say that the animal-rights campaign has
undermined public support for the facility, which receives
1.3 million visitors a year, and that some aquarium members
have dropped their membership because they believed false
statements in the fliers or in fund-raising materials
distributed by the animal-rights groups.
   Moreover, aquarium officials seem irked that the
animal-rights groups are trying to push aquarium reseachers
off the moral high ground when it comes to care of sea
animals and their habitats. According to the aquarium's legal
complaint, since 1972 the aquarium has rescued and
rehabilitated hundreds of sick and imperiled marine mammals,
including dolphins, whales and seals.
   If the animal-rights groups succeed in undermining that
program, said Mr. Schmahmann, "mammals will be stranded and
will die on beaches. And that is something the aquarium
cannot tolerate."

   ASBESTOS EXPOSURE triggers insurance coverage, Maryland
court rules.
   The ruling by the state's highest court came in a dispute
between a contracting company and its insurer over the issue
of what event triggers an insurance policy's coverage of
claims arising from asbestos-related disease.
   Maryland Casualty Co., Baltimore, had sought a ruling that
coverage wasn't triggered until an injury was discovered.
Such a ruling would have limited insurance coverage to the
policy in effect at the time of discovery, and thus have
freed Maryland Casualty of liability.
   But the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that insurance
coverage begins with inhalation of asbestos because the fiber
can immediately cause the development of asbestos-related
diseases even if those diseases don't show themselves for
many years. In ruling as it did, the court joined a growing
number of courts that have taken a similar view.
   But lawyers for the insurance industry said the Maryland
court didn't take the broadest view put forward by some other
courts -- that insurers who had provided policies after
exposure but before the disease became apparent were also
liable. The Maryland dispute involved Lloyd E. Mitchell Inc.,
a Maryland contracting firm that stopped operations in 1977.
   "Mitchell will have no significant impact on the company"
financially, said John D. Cole, chief claims officer at
Maryland Casualty, a member of the Zurich U.S. Group and a
subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Co., Zurich. Mr. Cole added
that the company was pleased by the relatively narrow scope
of the decision.
   While the case doesn't break any legal ground nationally,
it may influence asbestos disputes in Maryland. Currently, a
trial court in Baltimore is hearing a consolidated case
involving nearly 9,000 Maryland asbestos claims brought by
individuals against companies. Lawyers said the decision may
mean companies found liable in that case will be able to seek
coverage from their insurers.

   CLARENCE THOMAS presents mixed picture on antitrust law.
   In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Judge Thomas, the Supreme Court nominee, pledged fidelity to
the antitrust laws, particularly to protect small businesses.
Defining competition in terms of the health of small business
hasn't been fashionable in antitrust circles since the 1960s.
   In an article to be published in the Fordham Law Review,
William Kovacic, a law professor at George Mason University,
argues that if confirmed, Judge Thomas "would be a voice for
disavowing . . . expansive enforcement" of antitrust laws.
Mr. Kovacic cites Judge Thomas's one antitrust opinion as a
member of the federal appeals court in Washington. That
decision, a sharp defeat for federal antitrust prosecutors,
"assuredly reflects conservative antitrust values," asserts
Mr. Kovacic.

   SWEDISH LAW FIRM lures two New York partners.
   Daniel L. Bernstein and James F. Farrington Jr., will
leave the New York law firm Reid &amp; Priest to join the New
York office of Mannheimer Swartling, based in Stockholm.
   Few, if any, U.S. lawyers have joined European law firms,
in part because compensation at U.S. law firms is typically
higher than at law firms abroad. Most law firms open
international outposts with lawyers from their own countries,
although increasingly U.S. firms are bringing in European
partners.
   Mr. Bernstein, formerly Reid &amp; Priest's managing partner,
said he wanted to participate in the building of a
multinational law firm. He and Mr. Farrington represent
Swedish clients. Mannheimer Swartling also has offices in
Frankfurt, Moscow, Singapore and Beijing.

   NOTED: A federal judge denied a government request to put
off a trial on the issue of how much money the Internal
Revenue Service is due from Dennis Levine, the former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker who pleaded guilty to
securities fraud. The IRS filed a tax claim of $15.4 million,
which would more than wipe out the Mr. Levine's $13.5 million
insider-trading settlement fund and leave nothing for
defrauded investors. Judge Richard Owen, who set a trial date
of Sept. 30, had previously rejected a proposed Securities
and Exchange Commission settlement of the issue.

<HEAD>Scientists Reconsidering Trying to Determine Fate of Two Freed
Whales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are reconsidering whether to
try to determine the fate of two California gray whales freed from
the ice off Alaska's northern coast last month after a three-week
international effort.
   Officials decided against attaching radio transmitters to the
whales, in part because many did not want to find out in case the
mammals died soon after the $1 million rescue effort. They were
battered and bleeding when freed and had to navigate 200 miles of
ice-clogged waters to get to open seas.
   But now, scientists are considering distributing posters of the
whales to California tour boat operators in hopes that it will help
someone spot the animals, said Jim Harvey, a whale expert at the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   The main benefit would be to satisfy public curiosity about the
fate of the whales, Harvey said Tuesday.
   But he said any knowledge gained might be useful in determining
whether to undertake similar rescue efforts in the future, and
whether techniques developed in Barrow were effective.
   Scientists have found no trace of the whales since a Soviet
icebreaker carved an escape path late last month.
   Harvey emphasized that no decision has been taken yet and that
the chances of spotting the whales are slim in any event.
   Scientists were able to photograph only the whales' heads as they
surfaced to breathe in holes cut in the ice off the coast near
Barrow last month. But in open water, usually only a whale's back
and tail can be seen when it surfaces.
   ``They would just about have to swim up to a boat and stick their
heads out of the water to be identified,'' Harvey said.
   The whales also may not go as far south as California, where tour
boats take people out to view whales.
   Ron Morris, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist who
coordinated the rescue effort, said some of the endangered gray
whales stop near Vancouver, B.C., and San Francisco rather than
going all the way to breeding grounds off Baja California. Harvey
said young whales in particular, like the two that were freed, often
don't make the full migration.
   Assuming the whales made it to open seas, it could take them some
time to reach tour-boat territory. With an average migration speed
of 3{ mph, Morris estimated they are still somewhere in the Gulf of
Alaska off the state's southern coast.
   Morris and Harvey remained optimistic that the whales are still
alive despite the beating they suffered because the animals can lose
a significant amount of blood and survive.
   ``I don't see why they wouldn't make it,'' Morris said. ``I still
tend to be optimistic.''

   Two whales trapped for nearly three weeks
in the arctic ice pack were freed Wednesday by Soviet and American
icebreakers, superpower saviors who hacked a path to the open sea.
   ``The whales are loose and in the channel and headed out,'' said
Lt. Mike Haller, a spokesman for the Alaska National Guard. ``They
looked good all afternoon. To look at them, you'd have thought they
had their bags packed and were ready to head south.''
   ``They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'll
keep on truckin'. I don't know how much more we can do,'' said
rescue coordinator Ron Morris of the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The work to free the migrating California gray whales progressed
rapidly Tuesday when two Soviet ice-breaking vessels began smashing
the ice that kept the pair imprisoned. A third trapped whale is
believed to have died last week.
   Morris, who followed the whales by helicopter, landed a little
after 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT) to report that the whales had moved from
the final man-made breathing hole to the slushy path the Soviet
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev cut Tuesday night.
   Rescue officials were worried that the whales would have trouble
breaking air holes through the partly frozen cut, but around 4:30
p.m. rescue workers found the two whales had opened a small
breathing hole and were sharing it.
   One of the whales was bleeding enough to stain the water red.
   Spectators watched anxiously for several moments, waiting for the
whales to surface in the new waterway cut Wednesday by the Arseniev
_ and cheered joyously when the whales broke the surface.
   As darkness fell, the whales were swimming back and forth in the
channel. Officials halted helicopter surveillance at nightfall, but
said they planned to meet Thursday and could check whether the
whales had reached the sea.
   The Arseniev stayed in the channel Wednesday night, widening the
passage to the open sea, officials said.
   Scientists and others involved in the rescue may never know the
whales' fate. ``A lot of people really didn't want to know,'' said
Jim Harvey, a federal marine biologist, after officials decided not
to put electronic tracking tags on the already stressed animals.
   Haller said plans were being made in Barrow to thank the Soviets
with a party, but Soviet officers said they would wait until it was
clear the whales were in the open sea before celebrating.
   Before the whales were freed, as the Soviet icebreakers drew
near, the whales were ``acting in a very excited manner, almost like
they can sense freedom,'' said Sgt. Ian Robertson, an Alaska
National Guard spokesman.
   By midday, the Soviet icebreakers were a quarter-mile from the
line of breathing holes being cut by Americans working in the
opposite direction, he said.
   Later Wednesday, rescuers began to use a gargantuan, tractor-like
device propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the
icebreaker, Robertson said.
   The breakthrough in the effort to free the migrating gray whales
caught in an early freeze came after more than a week of delays and
disappointments.
   ``We feel very good about it,'' said Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen
of NOAA. ``The cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came
in here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately.''
   On Tuesday, the Americans moved the huge mammals around a shoal
that had stymied progress for three days. Eskimos with chain saws
cut a detour in the ice so the whales could swim around the shallow
water they had refused to pass.
   When the Eskimos started cutting the air holes, the whales
``followed the water right to the end. They like that deeper
water,'' Petersen said.
   Working in the other direction, the Soviet icebreakers reduced to
rubble the ice ridge standing between the whales and open water. The
ridge, formed by colliding ice masses, was a jumble of ice blocks as
big as small houses.
   ``The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Petersen said. ``It's
like they expected something to be happening. Everything seems to be
coming together.''
   The whales, which normally migrate to the Southern California
coast in the winter, were discovered off Alaska's northern coast
three weeks ago, the ice closing in around them and leaving them
only a few small breathing holes.
   The whales could not swim the four miles to open water without
surfacing for air. A third whale disappeared Friday and is believed
dead.
   The icebreakers _ the Admiral Makarov and the Arseniev _ began
working shortly after their arrival Tuesday, flying the flags of the
Soviet Union and the United States as a sign of cooperation between
the nations.
   The ships had been returning to their home port of Vladivostok
when they were diverted, said Alexander Patzevich, chief officer and
second in command.
   Although the Admiral Makarov has been at sea for six months and
``everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about
the diversion, Patzevich said.
   ``It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet
effort.
   First Mate Vladimir Moroz, who said he was the ship's political
officer, said the Soviets were happy to help. He said he spoke to a
Moscow newspaper by telephone.
   ``They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,''
he said. ``Our country is watching like everyone else. We love
animals, just as everyone.''
   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen to
about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the
past decade, officials said.
   The whales have one of the longest migration routes of all the
mammals, some 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the Arctic to the warm water
off Baja California.
   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individuals
on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the
environment,'' President Reagan said from the White House. ``It has
been an inspiring endeavor.''

   Two Soviet icebreakers flying
U.S. and Soviet flags worked today to smash through an ice ridge as
dawn approached on what rescuers hope will be freedom day for two
whales imprisoned in ice for nearly three weeks.
   ``The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Rear Adm. Sigmund
Petersen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
this morning. ``It's like they expected something to be happening.
Everything seems to be coming together.''
   Rescuers had one of their best days yet Tuesday as the
unprecedented international effort to save the two California gray
whales neared a climax. They succeeded in moving the huge mammals
around a shoal that had stymied progress for three days.
   As darkness fell Tuesday, the mammals were only about two miles
from the water being opened by the Soviet ships.
   The whales could be free by late this afternoon if things go as
well today as they did the day before, said NOAA rescue coordinator
Ron Morris.
   ``We feel very good about it,'' Petersen said this morning. ``The
cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came in here with a
very positive attitude and went to work immediately.''
   Later today, rescuers planned to use a tractor-like device
propelled by pontoon augers to cut the relatively thin ice remaining
between the whales and the icebreakers' farthest advance.
   ``We certainly hope it will end today,'' Petersen said. ``We are
just hoping that things are just coming together.''
   In another development Tuesday, the Federal Aviation
Admininistration ordered flights around Barrow Point to stay above
2,000 feet because of crowding by small planes taking a look at the
whales, The Washington Post said.
   Around noon Tuesday, Morris, Petersen and Capt. Jim McClelland of
the U.S. Coast Guard flew to the icebreaker Admiral Makarov as it
waited about 25 miles northeast of Barrow.
   After a perfunctory briefing, the icebreaker's skipper said he
was ready to begin work immediately.
   ``We shall commence just now,'' said Sergei Fedorovich Reshetov.
``In five minutes, our engines will be ready.''
   The 440-foot icebreaker, an American flag flying above its
frost-encrusted superstructure, quickly cruised through thin ice to
the pressure ridge that is the last significant barrier to freedom.
In just a few hours, the ship had battled almost three-fourths of
the way through the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as small
houses.
   With only about 100 yards to go, the Admiral Makarov, which draws
about 40 feet of water, nearly ran out of room. McClelland said he
thought the ship nudged the seabed from time to time.
   The plan was for the 496-foot Vladimir Arseniev, an ice-breaking
cargo ship which draws only about 20 feet, to finish the job.
Rescuers, however, did not think the smaller ship could go all the
way to the whales.
   The Admiral Makarov ran its bow up over the ice, shuddering only
slightly as its 20,000 tons broke through thicknesses of 6 to 8 feet.
   Spidery cracks raced in all directions outward from the ship as
it battered its way through ice blanketed with snow bearing the
tracks of polar bears.
   The vessel repeated the maneuver again and again, leaving
millions of dirty ice cubes as rubble.
   ``It's a magnificent ship,'' Petersen said as he watched the
icebreaker work.
   ``With the wind going as it is, it couldn't be better,''
McClelland said.
   Rescuers counted on a steady east wind and prevailing currents to
carry debris left by the icebreakers out of the whales' path.
   Meanwhile, chain saw-wielding Eskimos cut a detour for the whales
to swim around shallow water through which the animals had refused
to pass.
   By cutting breathing holes in deeper water away from the shoal,
the Eskimos were able to lure the whales about two miles from the
place where they were found. A third whale disappeared Friday and is
believed dead.
   The icebreakers had been returning to their home port of
Vladivostok when they were diverted, said Alexander Patzevich, chief
officer and second in command. The vessels dropped off personnel and
1,000 tons of equipment to establish a floating polar research
station last week.
   Although the Admiral Makarov has been at sea for six months and
``everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about
the diversion, Patzevich said.
   ``It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet
effort.
   The North Slope Borough helicopter that flew whale-rescue team
members to the icebreaker took Reshetov and several crew members to
see the whales.
   First Mate Vladimir Moroz, who said he was the ship's political
officer, said the Soviets were happy to help.
   He said he spoke to a Moscow newspaper by telephone on Monday.
   ``They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,''
Moroz said. ``Our country is watching like everyone else. We love
animals, just as everyone.''
   Moroz said another Soviet icebreaker helped free a pod of beluga
whales trapped in Bering Sea ice across from Alaska three years ago.
   The Admiral Makarov bore a gold-colored hammer and sickle on its
smokestack, and a Soviet flag flew from the stern. McClelland said
the captain's decision to fly a U.S. flag was a common courtesy.
   ``Normally, a merchant ship will fly the flag of the country it's
working in,'' he said.
   Small airplanes crowding the skies over the whales prompted the
FAA restriction.
   ``To have these airplanes swarming around like little bees over
the rescue operations turns into a nightmare on the ground,'' Paul
Steucke, an FAA spokesman in Anchorage, told the Post. ``In
addition, it's one heck of a hazard in the sky. The opportunity to
hit each other is quite high.''
   Normally, there are two commercial flights in and out of Barrow
each day.

   Two whales that held the world's attention
for weeks swam away from their icy trap but remained today in a
slushy channel cleared by Soviet icebreakers, the Coast Guard said.
Rescuers still hoped the leviathans would follow the ships out into
open sea.
   ``You break a path and it's like a Sno-Cone behind you, it
freezes overnight. ...,'' said Ray Massey, a Coast Guard spokesman
in Alameda, Calif. ``They're probably going from hole to hole in
small pools behind the icebreaker.''
   After dawn broke this morning, helicopter crews headed out in
hopes of better determining the status of the two California gray
whales, whom scientists had dubbed Crossbeak and Bonnet. ``We're
going to have to do a nose count,'' said Sgt. Ian Robertson of the
Alaska National Guard. He said at least two helicopters were being
sent up.
   Massey's Coast Guard post was receiving messages from a U.S.
guardsman assigned as liaison aboard one of the two Soviet
icebreakers that continued to clear the way for the whales the day
after the breakthrough that got the whales out of their solid-ice
trap.
   ``It's in nature's hands now,'' Gary Hufford, a National Weather
Service ice analyst, had said earlier.
   The whales swam Wednesday on what was hoped would be a long
journey to their winter home off Baja California. But officials said
there were still some ways from the open sea, in the path cleared by
the icebreakers earlier and already partially refrozen.
   ``My understanding is that the whales were still in the channels
and that they (icebreakers) were going to have to do more cutting,''
Massey said.
   ``They're going to open a path to real open water and hope they
follow them out. ... If we just walked off and left them now, I
don't think they could get out on their own. If the breakers go out,
then they should be able to follow to go to open water.''
   The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in
the rescue that cost more than $800,000 didn't attach radio
transmitters to the whales, in part because of concern that the
devices would only add to the animals' stress, said federal marine
mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago
apparently died last week.
   But a major factor in the decision against the transmitters was
that ``a lot of people really didn't want to know'' the surviving
whales' fate, Harvey said.
   In a final frenzy Wednesday, Eskimos using chain saws cut 50 new
breathing holes into the ice, nearly as many as they had cut in two
weeks. The whales, which grew accustomed to the cutting, repeatedly
surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice was removed.
   The animals moved to less than half a mile from a channel carved
through the 18-inch-thick ice by two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday
and early Wednesday. Then, the Eskimos were ordered to retreat so
the icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev could reopen the channel, already
partially refrozen.
   Scrambling to safety on Nuvuagluak Spit, the rescuers were joined
by a press corps that nearly outnumbered them.
   After two hours and no movement by the icebreaker, the Eskimos
grew impatient. Their years of experience with the Arctic Ocean told
them that a rising wind could begin stacking up the ice and undo all
the progress.
   Faced with a near revolt, rescue coordinators allowed the natives
back onto the ice, and they quickly moved the whales to within
one-quarter mile of the channel the Soviets had cut Tuesday.
   Finally, the icebreaker appeared out of the snowy squall line
ahead.
   Just after 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT), rescue coordinator Ron Morris
reported from his helicopter that the whales had surfaced in a small
pool in the old channel.
   One was bleeding enough to stain the ice and surrounding water.
   They then slipped beneath the surface. Moments later, the whales
appeared about 25 feet away in open water left by the icebreaker.
   The crowd cheered.
   As darkness fell, the whales were moving along the channel, which
the Arseniev continued to clear, at least two miles from any
significant open water.
   ``They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'll
keep on truckin','' Morris said. ``I don't know how much more we can
do.''
   ``I learned a lot,'' said Craig George, a North Slope Borough
wildlife biologist who babysat for the whales from the time they
were found trapped. ``I learned that with persistence, clear
thinking and proper chain saws, you can do anything.''
   The rescue effort initially bogged down with an attempt to move a
185-ton ice-breaking barge from the Prudhoe Bay oil field 200 miles
away. The barge progressed just six miles in about as many days.
   The Alaska National Guard then donated a huge helicopter that
dropped a 5-ton concrete cylinder through the ice. But it proved to
be of little value.
   A $600,000 device known as an Archimedes screw tractor, mounted
on auger-driven pontoons, was loaned by the oil industry, but a test
run showed the slushy trail it left made it unsuitable.
   The rescue finally came down to a few dozen Eskimos working from
dawn until dark cutting holes to keep the whales alive and the
Soviet icebreakers, whose help was solicited last weekend.
   The endangered California gray whales have one of the longest
migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the
Arctic to the warm water off Baja California.
   Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual
average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said.
   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individuals
on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the
environment,'' President Reagan said from the White House. ``It has
been an inspiring endeavor.''
   Precise figures on the cost of the rescue effort weren't
available, but an estimate of at least $800,000 was compiled from
estimates of a variety of governmental and private agencies and
businesses that took part. Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the federal
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this morning on
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that the cost to the federal
government was relatively small.

<HEAD>Ruling To Allow Accidental Harm To Whales During Arctic
Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies exploring in the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas north of Alaska won exemption Wednesday from a federal
law protecting whales and seals from even accidental harm.
   The ruling by the National Marine Fisheries Service allows each
company involved in oil and gas drilling or seismic exploration to
apply for letters of authorization allowing what is called ``a take
of marine mammals incidental to exploration.''
   The rule, published Wednesday in the Federal Register, will be
in effect for five years, although the authorization letters will
have to be renewed each year. The exemption stems from 1986
amendments to the Marine Mammals Protection Act and the Endangered
Species Act.
   The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission plans to file suit in
federal court to block the ruling, said Lynn Sutcliffe, a lawyer in
Washington for the commission.
   ``The industry can't be authorized willy-nilly to go out and do
what they want,'' Sutcliffe said. ``No one knows how much that
harassment will disrupt the reproductive cycle or end up killing
whales.''
   He said Alaska natives, who are allowed to take 41 bowhead
whales each year to maintain their traditional culture, fear that
oil exploration during the sensitive migration months could disrupt
the hunt or lead to international pressure for a lower whaling
quota.
   Until now, the oil companies have had to restrict their
explorations while whales were migrating through the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas, because they were prohibited from even incidental
harassment of the affected species.
   Sutcliffe said the commission would continue negotiations with
the oil industry for a negotiated settlement of the dispute, while
pursuing court action as well.
   Besides the bowhead, species covered by the ruling are the gray
whale, beluga whale, bearded seal, ringed seal and spotted seal.
   Margaret Lorenz, a spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said oil companies will be required to have a program to
monitor any effects of their activity on the whales and other
marine mammals, and also a plan of cooperation with the native
communities involved in the whale hunt.
   Wednesday's ruling, authorized by the Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972, was requested in February 1988 by the oil companies
Amoco, Chevron, Exxon, Shell, Unocal and Western Geophysical Co. of
America. ARCO Alaska Inc. joined the petition in January 1990.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, an agency of the Commerce
Department, held public hearings in Washington and in Barrow,
Alaska and prepared an environmental assessment that found there
would be no significant impact on the populations of marine mammals.

<HEAD>Governor Wants Dolphins Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has accused one of
the world's leading aquariums of illegally taking two bottlenose
dolphins from Tampa Bay, but aquarium officials say it's all a
misunderstanding.
   The governor directed officials Wednesday to find out if the
state can force release of the animals and to draft rules
restricting the capture and transportation of dolphins from Florida
waters.
   The National Aquarium in Baltimore did not have the correct
state permit when it moved two male dolphins captured Sunday in
Tampa Bay to a holding facility at Marathon in the Florida Keys,
said officials with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   ``It was a breach of state law and worse yet, it flies in the
face of our efforts to protect these special mammals,'' Martinez
wrote in his letter to DNR executive director Tom Gardner. Gardner
said he has asked his attorneys to investigate the situation.
   Officials of the National Aquarium said the only problem was a
technical flaw in their permit.
   ``We've been so meticulous and careful about every single aspect
of the collection process,'' said aquarium spokeswoman Vicki
Aversa. ``It's just a shame that this kind of situation has to
happen.''
   State and federal officials said Jay Sweeney, a marine mammal
veterinarian, had a federal permit to capture up to three dolphins
anywhere along the Gulf Coast.
   But a state permit is needed to move the dolphins, and the
permit Sweeney obtained specified that he could transport dolphins
only from Charlotte Harbor in Lee County on Florida's southwest
coast.
   Sweeney moved the animals from Tampa Bay on Tuesday without
amending the permit, said Charles Futch, DNR's assistant director
of marine resources. Ms. Aversa said the capture site was moved to
Tampa Bay because of criticism raised over the plan to take
dolphins from the Charlotte Harbor Aquatic Preserve.
   Ms. Aversa added that Sweeney had been given verbal permission
by the DNR to move the mammals from Tampa Bay. There was no comment
from Sweeney; neither acquarium nor state officials knew where he
was Thursday.
   Ms. Aversa said the dolphins will stay at Marathon for most of
the winter unless the state forces the aquarium to release them.

<TEXT>
   A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in
the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south
this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to
reunite it with its brethren.
   The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in
Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the
government do something to save it.
   On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the
animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to
save it.
   ``It's only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the
animal is believed to be in danger,'' said Bob Stone, special agent
with the service in Newport News.
   Kathy Read, a diving instructor at the bay, said Rascal has
slowed down and become thinner. ``That's probably due to the food
source probably drying up out there,'' she said.
   Divers hope to go into the bay Wednesday, trap the aquatic mammal
and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the Carolinas
or Georgia.
   Earlier this fall, the plight of three whales icebound off Alaska
attracted worldwide attention. One of the whales died, but the other
two made it to open water after a Soviet icebreaker carved a path
for them.
   Rascal's rescue is to be supervised by Robert Schoelkopf,
director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.,
because he has captured dolphins before, Stone said.
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia. Bob Byrne, associate
director for research at the institute, said today that it will work
with Schoelkopf on the rescue effort.
   Schoelkopf agreed that a rescue is risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three
years. Schoelkopf oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped
save dolphins off the North Carolina coast several years ago. An
attempted rescue of a dolphin in Delaware a few years ago failed
when the animal died of a heart attack, he said.
   Rascal may fare better, he said, because apparently it is young.
   Residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins
in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction
in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water.

   BALTIMORE -- The National Aquarium in Baltimore on
Wednesday unveiled a $35 million belated Christmas gift: a
spectacular new home for its expanded collection of six
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and three beluga whales.
   But not everyone is celebrating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Animal-protection groups are expressing opinions ranging
from qualms to downright anger over what they see as the new
facility's emphasis on glitz and entertainment rather than
education. And some are wondering whether it is proper to
keep marine mammals -- which are thought to be highly
intelligent -- in captivity at all. A small group of
picketers was on hand at the opening; the demonstrators said
the protests will continue.
   "Baltimore is a microcosm for a lot of the issues about
{whales and dolphins in} captivity," says Nancy Daves of the
Animal Protection Institute, based in Sacramento, Calif. The
result is increasing tensions between two groups --
supporters of aquariums and animal preservationists -- who
might otherwise have been expected to make common cause.
   Aquarium officials say the new facility -- which has a
circular tank 110 feet wide and 24 feet deep, surrounded by a
1,300-seat amphitheater and multimedia screens -- will
educate the public about how these animals behave in the wild
and the increasing dangers they face from man. "We were
incomplete in showing {visitors} the world of water," says
Nicholas Brown, the aquarium's executive director.
   Currently, three of the dolphins -- the rest of the
animals will join the show sometime in 1991 -- are featured
in presentations showcasing such abilities as tailwalking and
communication skills.
   Aquarium professionals praise the facility. "I've seen
quite a few dolphin demonstrations but this was one of the
best I've seen," says David Jenkins, deputy director of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. "I
think you are going to see people come away from the program
who will have a keener appreciation of the dolphin and whale
but also a keener appreciation of what to do to save the
marine environment in general."
   But Ben White of the Sea Shepherd Society, an
environmental-activist group, says, "These centers are
educational in entirely the wrong way. I don't buy the
argument that people who see captive whales and dolphins come
away as defenders of them."
   Paula Jewell, an official with the Humane Society of the
U.S., says, "I have mixed feelings about the show. I thought
it had the potential to be educationally useful . . . but the
Humane Society is always opposed to frivolous, entertaining
routines."
   Adding to critics' unhappiness is the fact that
Baltimore's aquarium doesn't have the best track record with
marine mammals. One of its four original bottlenose dolphins
died in the aquarium's first year and the others had to be
evacuated after developing ulcers attributed to the stressful
environment. A guest dolphin died soon after visiting in 1984
and a beluga whale contracted a fatal bacterial infection in
1989.
   In a textbook case of bad public relations, the aquarium
captured two dolphins off the Florida coast last year without
obtaining proper paperwork from that state. Despite intense
pressure, the aquarium held on to the animals: One died
within months of its capture, while the other has yet to be
removed from Florida.
   Mr. Brown says his institution has learned from past
mistakes. For example, the original dolphins were bothered by
the noise of the aquarium. Now, the tank walls are
soundproofed and the pumps and filtration system are isolated
from the exhibit so that the animals won't be bothered by
vibrations.
   But those changes haven't silenced critics. Many wonder
how the animals will do in a still tank that is 110 feet
wide, when they normally range over hundreds of miles of
ocean. All of Baltimore's dolphins and whales were born in
the wild, a situation that's distressing many involved with
animal protection.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an
animal-rights group, has already sponsored a protest at the
aquarium, and more may be coming. "We have a problem with
aquariums in general . . . they amount to prisons for free
roaming animals," explains a spokeswoman.
   Aquarium supporters say holding some marine mammals in
captivity is vital to the survival of their brethren in the
wild. "A lot of the political support for protecting these
animals comes from the direct experience the public has of
seeing them," says Peter Tyack, associate scientist with the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

   President Reagan telephoned the commander of a
whale rescue operation in Alaska on Tuesday to offer his support,
telling him that Americans' ``hearts are with you and our prayers
are also with you'' in the effort to save three mammals trapped by
ice in the Arctic Sea.
   Reagan, in a five-minute call to Col. Tom Carroll of the Alaska
Army National Guard, said he was ``very concerned'' about the
plight of the mammals and wanted an ``on-site report'' from Alaska.
The conversation was piped into the White House press room.
   The endangered California gray whales became trapped 18 miles
northeast of Barrow, Alaska, while migrating south to warmer
waters. The 24-to-30-foot-long mammals were bleeding and battered
from continually bashing into the jagged ice for nearly two weeks.
   Reagan said he had monitored the situation by watching
television.
   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' he told
Carroll, who was at a base camp at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, about 200
miles southeast of the whales.
   ``Anything that we can say or do to help you along with the
success of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it,'' the president
added.
   Carroll explained to the president details in the planned
operation in which a National Guard Skycrane helicopter was to tow
a 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge from Prudhoe Bay to
the whales.
   The operation was delayed for several hours because the owner
wanted to make sure it was totally safe to operate in the harsh
environment, Carroll said.
   He said that while the National Guard is coordinating the
operation, private companies and groups such as Greenpeace and the
National Marine Fisheries Service are also involved.
   ``It's extremely moving when you see the interest that has been
generated not only here but across the nation,'' Carroll said.
   He added that Reagan's call was a morale-booster for the crews
working in sub-freezing weather.
   ``This is the kind of thing that kind of makes it all
worthwhile,'' he said. But the big moment will come when the whales
are safe, he added.

   Humphrey the wandering whale, freed from
one spot in the mudflats of San Francisco Bay, spent most of
Tuesday stuck in another spot before he began wandering again.
   Five years after the 40-foot humpback's much publicized voyage
through the bay to the Sacramento River, he drew a crowd of
thousands to a cove near Candlestick Park, where he lay beached by
rocks bearing a ``No Trespassing'' sign.
   A team of marine biologists, veterinarians and the Coast Guard
nudged the 45-ton whale with their hands, splashed him with buckets
of water, towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to
suck mud from below him.
   ``Essentially we were trying to tease him off that mud rock,''
Frank Griffith of the California Marine Mammal Center said during
the effort. ``There's no amount of human beings that you could put
out there to push him off like you'd push a car down the street. If
he's stuck on the bottom by mud suction, you couldn't move him
unless he puts some effort into moving himself.''
   As afternoon high tide rolled in, Humphrey budged a bit from the
mud at 2:20 p.m., flipping his fins, raising his tail and blowing
water through his spout. The crowd cheered.
   A short while later, Humphrey got stuck again, but with more
work he freed himself and swam out into the bay while volunteers
banged pipes to direct him away from land.
   Once Humphrey reached deep water a quarter to a half mile away,
rescuers hoped to used recorded whale sounds to lure him out under
the Golden Gate Bridge to the ocean where he belongs.
   ``I think the guy likes attention. I think he likes people,''
said Frank Boyd of San Francisco, who was in the crowd watching
Humphrey.
   Humphrey became something of an aquatic celebrity in the fall of
1985, when he spent 25 days swimming in San Francisco Bay and the
Sacramento River Delta before being guided and cajoled back to the
Pacific.
   His legions of fans heralded him with songs, poems, books and,
of course, a T-shirt. The state and federal governments spent
$50,000 on the effort to coax him out to sea.
   Biologists recognize Humphrey through tail markings with a
unique pattern, like a fingerprint. They've spotted him in the
ocean near San Francisco every year since in August or September.
   Nearly 200 children from five grades in the nearby Bret Harte
Elementary School walked out to the edge of the bay Tuesday to
watch Humphrey.
   ``We are studying about whales,'' said Mrs. Swaraj Gujral, a
fifth-grade teacher. ``The children are very worried. They wonder
how he can survive. They said we should all get together and push
him. I think he likes it here. He went away but he left his heart
in San Francisco.''
   Efforts to move him using boards and a tow rope during the early
morning high tide failed. For most of the day, Humphrey's
white-striped dorsal hump poked only about three feet above the
surface while his head and tail remained under water.
   ``The fact is the animal didn't help us at all,'' said Denize
Springer, spokeswoman for the Marine Mammal Center. ``In 1985 when
he was stuck, then he helped us.''
   Humphrey beached himself twice Monday - the first time
blundering onto mud flats near Candlestick Park, snarling traffic
for hours as commuters slowed to gawk. The mammal finally floated
off on a rising tide but then worked himself into a real jam when
he became stranded again north of the stadium.
   He was completely out of the water as the tide went out Monday
night and again after sunrise. Volunteers from the Marine Mammal
Center then worked to keep him from becoming dehydrated.
   Another fear, Springer said, was that the whale's weight would
crush vital organs.
   ``He's literally lying on his lungs,'' she said.
   Springer said a blood test taken Monday and completed early this
morning showed nothing abnormal about Humphrey's condition ``other
than he has been under stress and hadn't eaten.''
   Although humpback whales aren't known to attack humans, the
volunteers trying to help the stranded mammal face the danger of
being hit by the whale's strong fluke, or tail, which could cause
serious injury or death.
   Those keeping watch included Sharnel Jackson, 14, who recalled
the whale's first visit.
   ``We had a big banner in class with Humphrey's name on it,'' she
said as she lifted the collar of her jacket to ward off the cold.
``I know Humphrey. I want to see him get free.''

A whale scientists identified as Humphrey, the errant humpback whose 1985 
odyssey through the Sacramento River Delta captured widespread attention, 
fought for his life late Monday after beaching himself in San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
During a day of high drama, the humpback struggled free after beaching himself 
in the morning near Candlestick Park, only to re-beach himself during the 
afternoon off nearby Hunter's Point. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, when the tide ebbed, the whale was left "high and dry," said 
marine biologist Marc Webber. "He's in a bad predicament now. We hope to have 
enough water to refloat him about 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists from the California Marine Mammal Center threw wet blankets 
onto the disoriented creature in a desperate attempt to keep him from 
overheating or becoming dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton mammal's internal organs could be crushed by his own weight if he 
does not move back into the sea, Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Balcomb, a marine biologist who assisted in Humphrey's rescue five years 
ago and has sighted the animal every year since off the Farallon Islands, made 
the identification Monday after viewing distinctive markings on the whale's 
flukes. Scientists say the underside of a humpback's tail bears a unique 
pattern much like a human fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether scientists had determined what was wrong with the whale, Balcomb 
said: "It's usual Humphrey behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Since his first foray into the bay, Humphrey has exhibited an affinity for 
shallow waters, and last year even swam into Bodega Bay, north of San 
Francisco, without incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's sick. I think he was feeding, or that was his plan, 
anyway," Balcomb said after viewing the whale from a boat. 
</P>
<P>
While scientists said Humphrey could survive until high tide early this 
morning, they expressed concern about his lethargic and unresponsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Although smaller California gray whales frequently wander into the bay, this is 
only the second time a humpback is known to have strayed. The first also was 
Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
The whale's appearance in mud flats south of the stadium snarled rush-hour 
traffic on the Bayshore Freeway because of rubbernecking motorists. Within 
hours, a small armada of Coast Guard and other vessels was mobilized to track 
the mammal. Hundreds of gawkers and whale lovers from throughout the Bay Area 
converged on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first saw him, we thought he was dead," said a California Highway 
Patrol officer who arrived shortly after the mammal was sighted. "But then he 
would flap his fins every once in a while to let us know he was alive." 
</P>
<P>
Piegin Barrett, head of the marine mammal center in Sausalito, said rescuers 
were obtaining sound recordings of humpback whales that were used to rescue 
Humphrey five years ago in an attempt to lure the whale to deeper waters. As in 
the first rescue of Humphrey, the Navy joined the effort, this time providing a 
special underwater amplifier for the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Humphrey has gotten himself out of some pretty tight places before," said Mary 
Jane Schramm, a spokeswoman for the marine mammal center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, scientists had dismissed the possibility that the whale was 
Humphrey, noting that there are perhaps 300 humpbacks who feed in local waters 
each summer and fall. "If this is Humphrey, he should know better," said marine 
biologist Patrick Brady. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, onlookers had swelled to about 500 as workers in nearby South San 
Francisco office buildings flocked to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Whales are awesome, and this is cheaper than going out into a boat to see 
them," said Jim McDaniel, a software salesman for GSI Transcomm. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the terrible things that are happening -- the budget mess, the gulf 
crisis, AIDS -- it is heartening to come out here and see something natural and 
beautiful," said Elizabeth Jackson of the McCaffrey &amp; McCall advertising 
agency.

   The story of three trapped whales and efforts to save them from
an icy death has generated sympathy across the nation and around
the world.
   The struggle against time and thickening Arctic ice has gripped
U.S. schoolchildren, made front-page news in Italy and France and
gained extensive coverage by Soviet television news.
   ``It's the kitten in the tree syndrome. If a kitten gets caught,
everybody gathers around to rescue it,'' said Patricia Warhol,
director of the American Cetacean Society in San Pedro, Calif.
   ``We can't do much about Japanese whale hunters, ocean pollution
and gill nets. But here are three whales that maybe we can save,''
Ms. Warhol said in a telephone interview.
   A combination of early ice and shifting winds trapped the three
California gray whales more than two weeks ago near the
northernmost tip of Alaska. Part of an endangered species, the
giant mammals feed in northern waters before migrating past
California to breed in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.
   Rescuers hope to free them by pulverizing a path through four
miles of ice. They succeeded in drawing the whales nearly a half
mile to open water with a string of holes Friday, but one of the
mammals disappeared later in the day and was presumed dead.
   Television has delivered daily scenes of the struggling whales
emerging to breathe every two minutes, their battered,
barnacle-encrusted snouts rubbed to the bone by jagged ice.
   ``It's a very powerful emotional scene,'' said Cynthia Wilson of
the Friends of the Earth, an environmental group in Washington,
D.C. ``We're not dealing with a bunch of fish. This is a mammal of
extraordinary intelligence that has been extraordinarily hunted and
persecuted.''
   Their plight is a teaching tool in classes such as Cathy
Garrett's kindergarten at Fremont Elementary School in San Diego,
Calif.
   ``Little children love anything big,'' Ms. Garrett said.
``They're very concerned about how the whales got trapped and why
they need to come up to breathe. They're aware these animals have a
right to live. They're fascinated by them.
   ``They want them to survive. They don't want them to be hurt.''
   The drama has produced a wave of support from well-wishers,
including a telephone pep talk from President Reagan to chilled
rescuers. Some have suggested using explosives, rock salt and
bowling balls to defeat the ice.
   ``We get calls and calls and calls,'' said Anne Dingall,
director of ocean ecology for the environmental group Greenpeace.
``A lot of people are phoning for information or to see if there's
anything they can do to help.''
   One suggestion paid immediate dividends. Greg Ferrian and Rick
Skluzacek, two brothers-in-law from Lakeland, Minn., flew to Alaska
at their own expense Wednesday to use their de-icing machines to
enlarge the whales' air pockets.
   The frozen theater has been front-page news in Italy and France,
where TV newscasts play whale clips prominently.
   Soviet coverage has been unusually extensive, with the nightly
news program Vremya carrying reports every day. Some Muscovites say
the rescue attempts give them a good impression of Americans'
concern for life, more than any disarmament initiatives.
   West Germany's ZDF television network was more tongue-in-cheek.
Its report Thursday night said the ``Walkampf,'' a German compound
meaning whale struggle, had upstaged the presidential
``Wahlkampf,'' the German word for election campaign. Pronunciation
of the two words is identical.
   And one South African whale expert was skeptical about the
rescue effort.
   Peter Best of the South African Museum in Cape Town said in an
interview published Friday that the rescue effort ``is all very
humanitarian and noble, but it makes nonsense out of U.S. funding
for (maritime) research,'' which he said has been slashed.
   Gray whales were hunted to near extinction by the 1920s, when
their numbers dipped to below 1,000 while their skins were used for
buggy whips and corsets and their teeth fashioned into ivory
jewelry.
   Environmentalists now estimate their population at about 20,000.

   Animal rights activists asked a federal judge
Monday to stop the New England Aquarium from trading a dolphin to
the Navy, alleging the aqyarium has no legal permit to possess the
mammal.
   ``Whether we get it (a stop to the trade) by agreement or
whether we get it by injunction we don't care,'' said Steven Wise,
a lawyer for the group Citizens to End Animal Suffering and
Exploitation.
   Wise, who filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Boston, said
an informal letter of agreement between the Navy and New England
Aquarium would not be a legal transaction for the dolphin. He said
the trade requires a formal permit from the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   Aquarium spokeswoman Audrey Conley said the aquarium followed
Fisheries Services procedures and received appropriate documents
for the dolphin.
   Roddy Moscoso of the fisheries service in Washington said: ``We
consider the dolphin Rainbow to be legally residing at the
aquarium.''
   Over the weekend, the coalition and other animal rights groups
protested outside the aquarium after learning of a proposed deal to
trade a male dolphin named Rainbow to the Naval Ocean Systems
Center in San Diego, Calif., for a partly deaf female dolphin.
   The aquarium said Rainbow must be moved because it has become
too agressive to get along with other dolphins.
   John H. Prescott, the aquarium's executive director, said
Saturday that public interest led him to rethink the swap. But the
aquarium spokeswoman said Monday that no decision has been reached.
   Opposition to the trade stems from reports that the Navy trains
dolphins to kill enemy frogmen. The Navy says it trains and studies
142 marine mammals in classified underwater surveillance and
detecting and marking objects for recovery.

<HEAD>Navy Asked to Consider Moral Questions in Military Use of Dolphins</HEAD>

   Critics are questioning the morality of
the Navy's plan to train naturally playful dolphins to guard
nuclear submarines.
   ``We are militarizing space ... and now we have the audacity to
think we can militarize animals. It is insane,'' Jeanne Clark of
Hempstead, N.Y., said at a hearing Wednesday night on the Navy's
plan to use as many as 16 dolphins to guard its Trident subs at
Bangor.
   Animal-rights activists protested military use of dolphins after
news reports in 1988, citing Navy records, said 13 dolphins in Navy
training had died from 1986 to 1988. Nearly half suffered from lack
of appetite or stomach ulcers. Other ailments included hepatitis
and pneumonia.
   The Navy recently reported that none of its 142 marine mammals
had died since June 1989.
   Animal-rights groups sued the Navy in April 1989, arguing that
bringing dolphins to Bangor required an environmental impact
statement under federal law. No dolphins are now at Bangor. Eight
Trident subs are stationed there.
   The groups dropped the lawsuit in May when the Navy agreed to
conduct the environmental review. The assessment is due next
summer; Wednesday night's hearing was on its scope.
   Laurie Raymond of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society in
Seattle said the assessment should consider scientific questions
such as the effects of stress and cold water on the warm-water
dolphins.
   Most speakers made more emotional arguments.
   ``We are polluting the moral environment,'' said the Rev.
Gretchen Woods of Kitsap Unitarian Universalist Association.
   Les Bivens, associate head of the biosciences division at the
Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego, said it would be difficult
to address moral questions in the impact statement.
   But he said, ``I do not think the people here have anything to
worry about whatsoever.'' A federal Marine Mammal Commission
investigation in 1989 found no major problems in the Navy's
dolphin-training program.
   In Boston, meanwhile, protests from animal-rights activists have
led an aquarium director to rethink plans to trade an aggressive,
unsociable show dolphin to the Navy.
   The New England Aquarium would have sent Rainbow, an 11-year-old
male, to the secret underwater mammal program at the San Diego
center.
   Aquarium director John H. Prescott said Wednesday he believed
the trade would be good for Rainbow. But he added, ``If it's
causing public concern, I must pay attention. It's not a closed
issue.''

   If all else fails and rescuers scrambling
to free two gray whales trapped by Arctic ice are forced to airlift
the mammals to freedom, a California company is ready to fashion a
custom sling.
   ``We're on call,'' said John Ortega of Ortega Sail and Canvas in
Carlsbad, Calif. ``I've already picked up the fabric. I'm ready to
go as soon as they call us.''
   Dan LeBlanc, spokesman for Sea World of San Diego, said the
National Marine Fisheries Service contacted the marine life park
seeking someone who could make a sling for an airlift.
   Dr. Marilyn Dahlheim, an oceanographer with the NMFS National
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, said her office sought advice
from Sea World because the marine life park has used such slings and
had the appropriate contacts to locate a manufacturer. It
recommended Ortega.
   ``The OK has not been given to start cutting the material,'' she
said. ``...We need people who have done this before. And they are
the experts. You don't re-invent the wheel when you don't have to.''
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administraiton biologists have
said hauling the trapped whales to open water would be a last
alternative because of the danger of harming the whales.
   Ortega, with 22 years experience in custom sewing and
manufacturing, said he already has designed a sling for the Alaska
whales.
   ``It's going to be flat, more like a rectangle. It's not going to
be real exotic because we don't have time to cut holes out for
fins,'' he said. ``It's going to a large, flat sling, about 30 feet
long, reinforced with metal rods. It's got to hold 12 tons.
Normally, I cut in fin holes, but this a different kind of mammal.''
   He said the finished product would look like a large stretcher
with various holes for the helicopter to pick up the sling.
   ``I've never made one this large before. The whales that Sea
World picks up are about 20 feet, these whales are longer.'' Ortega
said he has made slings for Sea World for about 10 years.
   He said he would donate his time and labor if the sling is
ordered and that it would take him and a crew of six to eight
workers about 10 hours to fashion the sling out of ballistic nylon
and webbing. Sea World is paying for the fabric.
   LeBlanc said rescue workers have talked in general terms with Sea
World about a possible airlift.
   ``At the least, we'll consult from here, and at the most, we'll
go up and do what we can,'' LeBlanc said.

AT LONG LAST, HUMPHREY LEAVES BAY FOR OPEN SEA

Humphrey the humpback whale swam out the Golden Gate to freedom Wednesday, once 
again ending a successful rescue effort to save the world's most celebrated 
cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in five years, a flotilla of boats escorted the 40-foot 
marine mammal out of San Francisco Bay and into the Pacific as hundreds of 
people lined the shore to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderfully exhausted," said Patrick Brady, a rescue volunteer who, at 
one point, stayed up through the night to aid the trapped whale. "It was well 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, who had been towed from the muddy bay bottom Tuesday by a U.S. Coast 
Guard boat, was discovered Wednesday morning still swimming in the bay south of 
the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from the California Marine Mammal Center and members of the Coast 
Guard resumed their rescue efforts, banging on metal pipes dangling in the 
water. The noisy action drove the whale out of the bay at precisely 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day rescue was just a brief reminder of Humphrey's 26-day sojourn 
into San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River five years ago this month. 
Frequently seen in the waters off Northern California since, he swam back into 
the bay on Sunday. Whale experts had no explanation for his unusual behavior, 
except to say that he is an unusual whale. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever figure out why he came back," said Marc Webber, a 
marine biologist with the Marine Mammal Center who helped coordinate the 
rescue. "Maybe he's got a screw -- or a flipper -- loose." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Webber said Humphrey had tremendous value to his endangered 
species as an envoy who touched the hearts of humans. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's done in his life has really galvanized a lot of interest in whales 
and drawn people closer to whales," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue provided whale scientists with some of their closest contact ever 
with a live humpback -- including at one point standing on his flippers while 
he was beached near Candlestick Park for 24 hours Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very gentle with us," said Jan Roletto, curator of the Marine Mammal 
Center. "He could easily have crushed us." 
</P>
<P>
Although rescuers coaxed Humprhey to within several miles of the Golden Gate 
before dark Tuesday, he swam back south of the Bay Bridge during the night and 
was discovered there Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton whale spent much of the day swimming back and forth in the channel 
between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island -- in sight of the city's 
financial district. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three hours, he resisted the efforts of rescuers to herd him 
under the bridge. The team members pounded on their metal pipes with hammers -- 
the same technique used by Japanese fishermen to catch dolphins and by rescuers 
five years ago to herd Humphrey out of the Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
This time however, Humphrey repeatedly dived under water only to come up for 
air behind the line of boats. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about 3 p.m., he swam slowly under the Bay Bridge, meandered past 
San Francisco, spouted once under the Golden Gate Bridge and headed out to sea. 
Half-a-dozen Coast Guard and private vessels followed him more than a mile, 
just before sunset, to make sure he did not come back. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey has shown remarkable resilience. Whale experts said he appeared to be 
healthy, despite spending 24 hours stranded in mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be swimming and diving pretty well," Webber said. "That's a good 
sign. So far, he doesn't seem to be showing any sign of ill-effects." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the rescue of Humphrey has been a low-budget effort made up 
primarily of volunteers from the Marine Mammal Center. Coast Guard Lt. Jim Cash 
said the only additional cost for his operations was the fuel for the boats, 
which so far had amounted to $170. 
</P>
<P>
However, a $17,000 underwater transmitter that was used in an attempt to lure 
Humphrey with whale sounds, was ruined after it was stuck in the mud Tuesday.

   A team of government and private veterinarians
has cleared the Navy of allegations it mistreated dolphins and sea
lions being trained for various underwater surveillance duties.
   The Marine Mammal Commission review team, after what it described
as an extensive survey of Navy facilities and practices, sharply
criticized a former Navy trainer and other unidentified sources who
charged last November the service was guilty of animal abuse.
   ``The review team found the allegations to be substantively
lacking,'' states the commission's report, released Wednesday by the
Navy.
   The team ``concluded that allegations had been put forward in
such a way as to create an inaccurate picture,'' the report
continued.
   ``Furthermore, the team concluded that, had the sole motivation
underlying the allegations been concern for the health, welfare and
care of the animals, the former trainer would have made better use
than he did of the Navy's Animal Care Committee.''
   The program now includes about 115 animals, the majority of them
dolphins and the remainder of them beluga whales. THe service trains
the mammals to detect enemy scuba divers and to hunt for underwater
mines. The program began more than 20 years ago.
   The Washington-based Marine Mammal Commission, which advises all
federal agencies on the handling of marine mammals, ordered an
investigation after former Navy trainer Rick Trout charged last
November he had witnessed ``incidents of abuse, weight loss,
corporal punishment and damage to animals after transport.''
   Trout, who no longer works for the Navy, made the allegations
during an appearance before the International Marine Animal Trainers
Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
   To investigate the charges, the commission appointed a
seven-member review team that included veterinarians or medical
doctors from the Agriculture Department; the National Marine
Fisheries Services; various university faculties, and the Chicago
Zoological Society.
   None of the members had ties to the Navy.
   After conducting lengthy interviews with Trout and other former
Navy employees, and then inspecting Navy facilities and records, the
review team concluded:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _A Navy dolphin that died after being transported to the Persian
Gulf did not succumb to ``poor training, mistreatment, mishandling
or changes in water temperature.'' The dolphin died of bronchial
pneumonia.
   _``There is no evidence that the nutritional program as it
presently exists has adversely affected the health and welfare of
the animals,'' and certainly no evidence of intentional starvation.
   _The only trainer ever observed using food to ``bait'' a dolphin
during training or dumping fish outside a netted pen as punishment
``was the person making the allegations.''
   _There have been only two isolated incidents within the past
three years of a trainer slapping or striking a dolphin, and in both
cases the trainers were immediately disciplined.
   _During the last 22 months, three dolphins have died at the
Navy's mammal center in San Diego. The deaths ``were not related to
improper training, poor handling techniques or inadequate veterinary
care.''
   _And there is ``no evidence of animals having been blinded or
injured or as a result of poor training procedures.''
   The team did not give the Navy a completely clean bill of health.
For example, it concluded the Navy's San Diego facility _ where
Trout worked _ did a better job than a facility in Hawaii of
ensuring that veterinarians supervised all aspects of care and
training.
   It also criticized delays in the hiring of two additional
full-time veterinarians and noted that ``in the past, there has been
one high-level person within the Pentagon responsible for the marine
mammal program.''
   ``That does not appear to be the case now. The team recommends
that such an assignment be made.''
   All in all, though, the Navy is following or exceeding federal
guidelines for the proper handling of marine mammals, the team said.
And in some areas, such as the ratio of trainers and veterinarians
to animals and medical care standards and record-keeping, the Navy's
performance ``is as good as or better than in other institutions.''

   Experts and volunteers lovingly tending
what are believed to be the first beaked whales in captivity are
surprised the ailing young cetaceans remain alive more than a week
after being beached.
   ``I didn't expect them to live through the (first) night; I
didn't expect them to make it off the truck and into the pool,''
said Dr. Laurie Gage, veterinarian at Marine World-Africa USA.
   ``No one's ever seen these guys alive,'' she said. ``There are
whale experts coming in from all over because they've never seen one
alive.''
   But Gage, staff and volunteers at the animal park where the
whales were in stable but guarded condition Saturday tried to be
realistic about the mammals' poor chances for survival and a return
to their home at deep ocean depths.
   ``It's hard not to become attached; You look at their big brown
eyes and....,'' Gage said as she watched the pair swim slowly around
their shaded isolation tank.
   Alexander and Nicholas were found on San Francisco's Ocean Beach
Aug. 24 and taken to Marine World, about 35 miles northeast of San
Francisco. While scientists aren't sure of their species, they think
the two are less than a year old _ possibly only a few months old.
   Their rescue excited marine mammal experts because beaked whales
_ which live beyond the continental shelf and dive thousands of feet
for squid _ are almost never seen except as a rare skeleton or
carcass washed up on a beach.
   So little was known about beaked whales that the experts rushed
to the reference books, Gage said.
   Most stranded dolphins and whales are sick or hurt, and Nicholas
and Alexander are battling serious health problems, Gage said.
   Although they have improved somewhat since their rescue, both
still have low white blood cell counts, indicating a bacterial
infection or virus-caused immune system disorder. They have been
treated with antibiotics, vitamins and steroids and force fed a
``fish shake'' and liquids by tubes inserted into their tail flukes.
   In addition, Alexander developed a mild cast of pneumonia
Saturday, said Cecilia Pelshakov, a Marine World spokeswoman.
   Nicholas, the larger of the pair at 10 feet, also has an
undetermined liver problem and an accumulation of gas between the
skin and muscles on his left side _ possibly caused by a blow.
   Two cardiologists from a local hospital have inserted three small
tubes, held in place with a mesh ``tank top,'' to let the gas escape.
   ``He seems a little more active and more comfortable,'' Gage
said, adding that it could take several days for the gas to be
eliminated, allowing Nicholas to dive.
   Marine World's staff was guardedly optimistic Friday because the
9-foot Alexander, in better shape and more stable from the start,
ate three pounds of herring with the help of his handlers.
   The park's staff of 16, with the help of volunteers from the
California Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, has been watching the
whales around the clock. Gage and the other handlers are delighted
the sleek gray creatures, which probably never saw people before,
are gentle and accepting of humans.
   ``What's so remarkable to us is they're showing such an interest
in people,'' said Marine World spokeswoman Mary O'Herron. ``They
follow the trainers around'' and suck on their thumbs, she added.
   Marine mammal experts from the California Academy of Sciences in
San Francisco, the University of California at Santa Cruz, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, and the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles
have visited the 32-foot diameter, 3-foot deep tank for a chance to
see the beaked whales.

<TEXT>
   Divers and scientists failed again
today to rescue a bottlenose dolphin that became stranded in the
chilly waters off this coastal community after neglecting to migrate
south for the winter.
   At one point the rescuers managed to snare the frisky dolphin in
a net, but the mammal slipped away before he could be brought out of
Broad Bay.
   The effort was then suspended until Jan. 4 to reassess strategy
and get a stronger net, said Robert Helfant, captain of the
emergency medical services dive team in Virginia Beach.
   ``The net wasn't really the right kind of net,'' Helfant said.
``The biggest thing is safety for both the fish and the people.''
   Rescue officials were worried about the divers safety because one
diver got caught in the net. The diver had to be cut out, but he was
uninjured, said Bruce Edwards, director of emergency medical
services.
   Excited shouts and curses came from the divers as they briefly
trapped the animal. ``Get it together,'' one diver shouted as he
handled the net.
   About 10 boats left around dawn in the second day of the rescue
attempt. Divers and marine scientists tried for seven hours
Wednesday to rescue the dolphin, nicknamed ``Rascal,'' before
suspending the effort until this morning.
   ``Everything went right except for the dolphin,'' said Robert
Schoelkopf, the leader of the effort to move the dolphin to warmer
water.
   The young dolphin remained strong enough to evade the net despite
being stuck in the 40-degree water with little food, Schoelkopf said.
   ``He's not weak at all,'' he said. Still, he added, the mammal
remained in danger from the cold water.
   If the 200- to 300-pound dolphin is caught, he will be airlifted
by a Coast Guard helicopter to waters off North Carolina's Outer
Banks.
   Thirteen rescue vessels, ranging from inflatable rafts to
sport-fishing boats and carrying more than 50 people, made a
half-dozen attempts Wednesday to net the dolphin.
   About 100 spectators gathered Wednesday on a point of land near a
narrow channel where most of the rescue attempts took place. Others
watched from private boats, including Mayor Meyera Oberndorf, four
businessmen in suits and nearly two dozen reporters and
photographers.
   Today, about a dozen people watched from the shore, including the
staff of a radio station that broadcast the event live.
   Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in
Brigantine, N.J., said the would-be rescuers were thwarted Wednesday
by strong currents as well as the dolphin's strength. He also said
the mammal was frightened by the number of rescue boats and by the
net.
   Residents believe the dolphin lingered in the bay long after
fellow dolphins headed south because he was frightened by bridge
construction over a narrow channel leading to the open waters of
Chesapeake Bay.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service approved the unusual rescue
Monday and asked Schoelkopf to supervise it because of his
experience rescuing dolphins.

   The Marine Mammal Commission said it would look
into allegations that Navy trainers beat and starved dolphins in a
classified surveillance program, but a Navy spokesman denied the
animals were mistreated.
   ``We don't punish mammals or any of the animals for not
performing tasks, but we reward them (with food) for satisfactory
performance,'' said Lt. Ken Ross, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
``We aim to keep them as healthy as possible because they are very
valuable to us.''
   Ross was responding Wednesday to allegations by dolphin trainer
Rick Trout, who this week told a meeting of marine animal trainers
that he witnessed ``incidences of abuse, weight loss, corporal
punishment and damage to animals after transport.''
   Trainers also use ``very negative methods, including food
deprivation, corporal punishment and other aversive techniques,''
said Trout, a civilian hired to work with the dolphins in San Diego,
where they are trained by the Navy to help detect mines or enemy
frogmen.
   Ross insisted that the program operated out of the Naval Ocean
Systems Center was ``running smoothly,'' but he said an
investigation will be conducted to ensure the animals are being
cared for properly.
   ``Those are allegations we are checking,'' Ross said.``Our
primary concern is the health and safety of the animals, and the
treatment of all our animals is well within the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. We never have and never intend to do anything that
could bring harm to the animals.''
   A veterinarian is always either present or on call during
training, he said, adding that the Navy considered the program's
dolphin mortality rate of 5 percent to be better than the species'
mortality rate in the wild.
   Trout, who no longer works for the Navy, made his comments in an
appearance before the International Marine Animal Trainers
Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, citing unidentified sources,
reported Wednesday that four of the Navy's three dozen dolphins have
died during the past 18 months and that an undetermined number of
others were blinded or crippled by abusive handlers.
   John Twiss, executive director of the Washington-based Marine
Mammal Commission, said the Navy's dolphin training center ``met or
exceeded all standards published by the animal and plant health
inspection service of the Department of Agriculture'' in 1986.
   Nevertheless, he said the commission, which advises federal
agencies on the handling of marine mammals, wants to find out if
there is any truth to the allegations.
   ``We'll try to find out what is actually happening. We're
certainly not going to disregard a story like this,'' Twiss said.
   Navy officials said they were aware of two dolphin deaths within
the program in recent months and were checking the reports of
additional deaths.
   One of the dolphins died while on assignment in the Persian Gulf
last year from complications of a bacterial infection. The second
died of unknown causes while on being trained near Indian Island off
Washington state.

A federal appeals court ruled today that Alaska natives, normally exempt from a 
moratorium on killing rare marine mammals, may be criminally prosecuted if 
their killing of the animals is found "wasteful." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholds the constitutionality of 
a provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act regulating wasteful killing of 
marine mammals by Indians, Aleuts or Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The law established a moratorium on taking or importing marine mammals or 
products made from the animals except for the making of authentic native 
handicrafts and clothing or meat sold for subsistence living in Alaskan 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits native Alaskans from wasting substantial portions of a marine 
mammal that was killed.

<LEADPARA>  Answering the bark of sea lions in San Francisco and Monterey bays with a bite
to eat will soon become illegal under a federal rule that bans the feeding of
all wild marine mammals, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
announced Friday.;    "We are very worried that feeding mammals in the wild
will disrupt their natural eating habits and have severe negative impacts on
marine mammal populations," William Fox Jr., assistant administrator for
NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, said in a statement.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW RULE BANS FEEDING OF WILD SEA LIONS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Paul Rogers contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The rule is aimed at quelling the sudden growth of dolphin feeding cruises
in the south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. But it also includes mammals like
the sea lions that frequent piers in Santa Cruz and Monterey, Fox said.;   
Dependency, malnutrition and altered feeding habits have been byproducts of
humans feeding wild animals like grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park,
Fox said. Studies have also found that marine mammals fed by humans approach
boats more frequently, putting themselves at risk of injury. Additionally,
such feeding sometimes disrupts the timing of natural migrations because
animals remain in an area where handouts are plentiful.;    Business owners on
the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf criticized the measure as unnecessary.;   
"It's very extreme," said one owner who did not want his name used for fear of
being fined.;    Like several other small businessmen, the man sells cups of
mackerel and anchovies -- primarily to children who want to feed the barking
sea lions below the wharf.;    Losing that part of his sales could well cut
customer traffic and hurt sales of other items, including food and drinks, he
said.;    The rule takes effect April 19. Violators could be fined up to
$20,000.  </TEXT>

   A bottlenose dolphin today eluded
rescuers who tried four times to snare it and move it to warmer
waters for the winter.
   By late morning, the rescuers suspended their efforts to try to
decide what to do next.
   As many as nine boats and about 30 people were involved in the
risky rescue attempt that began this morning about 8 a.m. on Broad
Bay, but the animal swam away after each attempt.
   The rescuers also were faced with a leaking inflatable boat and a
strong current that at one point wrapped a net around one boat's
propeller.
   After one attempt to snare the dolphin, one radio transmission
called out, ``Hold off, hold off. He got through us.''
   The effort was coordinated by a dolphin expert from New Jersey
and was authorized Monday by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   The male dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, failed to migrate south for
the winter. Rescuers hoped to capture the mammal in nets and fly it
to North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   The dolphin's plight rallied residents of this coastal community.
   ``Anything we can do to help, we want to help,'' said Josiah
Woodington, a resident assisting in the rescue effort. ``I think
that it's great that we can come together and catch this fish. ''
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in Brigantine, N.J., who was to coordinate the rescue, agreed it was
risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin was in Broad Bay on Tuesday, said Kathy Read, a
diving instructor who worked on the rescue plans.
   ``He still circles the boat and stays right with you. Hopefully,
he'll be ready to move south,'' she said.
   Residents had been lobbying for the rescue since the dolphin was
noticed in the bay in early October. Since then, it has become thin
and slowed down, probably because of a lack of food, Ms. Read said.
Water temperature in the bay has dipped to 42 degrees.
   Residents believe the dolphin stayed in the bay because it was
frightened of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the
bay and open water.

   An emaciated five-ton whale was stuck
in a shallow bay off Long Island today, and adverse weather forced
conservationists to postpone plans to pull the 17-foot mammal into
the Atlantic Ocean.
   The adolescent Minke whale wandered into Peconic Bay last week,
said Sam Sadove of the Okeanos Research Foundation in Hampton Bays.
   The Coast Guard and foundation researchers had hoped to harness
the whale to two boats today and tow it through Shinnecock Canal
and Shinnecock Bay into the Atlantic, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Steve Dowd.
   But Pat Logan, an administrative assistant at the foundation,
said winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing
attempt for today and will likely force a postponement until
Thursday.
   Earlier plans to rescue the animal were suspended Monday when
whale-watchers said they hadn't seen the mammal since dusk Sunday
night and there was no signal from a radio transmitter that was
placed on it Saturday, Sadove said.
   But a plane sent up by the foundation sighted the whale around
3:30 p.m. Monday, he said.
   The whale was discovered by boaters in Sag Harbor two weeks ago
and moved into the shallow waters of Peconic last week. This is the
first whale sighted in the bay, according to Okeanos' records,
which go back to 1880.
   About the time the whale was spotted in Sag Harbor, three
California gray whales became trapped near Barrow, Alaska. A rescue
operation for those whales was in progress today.

   Marine mammal rescuers tried to feed a young
brydes whale Saturday but it was in critical condition a day after
being rescued from a sandbar.
   A biologist at Sea World, where the 4,200-pound female whale was
taken late Friday, said the whale might have become separated from
its mother and then blown farther away by Tropical Storm Keith,
which swept through the Gulf of Mexico early last week. Brydes
whales are native to offshore tropical water.
   Dr. Dan Odell, also the scientific coordinator for the Southeast
U.S. Marine Mammal Stranding Network, gave a dim prognosis for the
whale's survival, but said the 22-foot, 9-inch mammal was resting
and started making sounds.
   ``That's about as good as you can expect from a beached whale at
this point,'' said Odell. ``It's been in a very stressful set of
circumstances probably for some days.''
   Squid were placed in the whale's mouth every three or four hours,
but the whale did not respond well to the food. Odell said they
hoped to ``get it feeding on whole food like that, rather than
resorting to a stomach tube.''
   The whale was rescued Friday night after it beached itself in the
Intercoastal Waterway near Honeymoon Island in the Gulf of Mexico.
Scientists loaded it onto a stretcher between two boats, then drove
it by truck to the marine animal park.
   The whale was estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old.
   Brydes whales, not an endangered species, grow to 40 feet in
length.
   They are a species of baleen whale, which have no teeth but use a
series of flexible fibrous plates that act as sieves to feed on a
wide range of sea life from plankton to shrimp and squid.

<HEAD>Aquarium To Send Dolphin to Navy; Animal Rights Groups Angry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New England Aquarium plans to send one of its
three show dolphins to a Navy program that does research on them
and trains them for military work, a move that has prompted
protests.
   Federal records indicate it will be the fourth dolphin the
aquarium has sent to the U.S. Naval Ocean Systems Center in San
Diego in the last 10 years, The Boston Globe said today.
   The curator of marine mammals at the aquarium, Kathy Krieger,
worked for the Ocean Systems Center for two years.
   The dolphin to be sent there is Rainbow, who is about 11 years
old and is being sent because he is aggressive and incompatible
with the other two used in shows at the aquarium, she said.
   ``We feel that is the place he will get the best care,'' she
said. She admitted the aquarium does not know exactly what the Navy
plans to do with him.
   ``We know he will not be treated in an inhumane manner or be in
any danger,'' she said. ``The people who work with the animals in
the Navy assure us that none of the animals have been hurt.''
   Thomas LaPuzza, spokesman for the Navy center, said Rainbow will
be used immediately for research but he could not say whether he
ever will be used for military work.
   The Navy's dolphin program is classified. It has been criticized
for use of animals in war and for the way dolphins are treated.
   ``I'm very surprised they would plan on releasing animals to the
Navy. I'm shocked,'' Scott Van Valkenburg of the Boston Marine
Mammal Coalition, told the Globe.
   ``The fact that they might be sending animals to a program where
they might be used in military action is amazing,'' he said. The
group said it plans a protest rally Saturday.
   ``We're looking into how they are planning to transport this
dolphin,'' said Doreene Close of the Coalition to End Animal
Suffering and Exploitation. ``If we can find that out, we will do
everything in our power to stop it.''
   The Navy will send the aquarium an 11-year-old, partially deaf
female dolphin as a replacement for Rainbow, and Ms. Krieger
thought it would fit in better with the other two at the aquarium.
   LaPuzza said the Navy used dolphins for military work in Vietnam
and in 1987 in the Persian Gulf, but he would not say what they did.
   A former trainer at the Navy facility said dolphins were trained
to kill with .45-caliber guns attached to nose cones, the Globe
said. The guns would be triggered when dolphins rammed enemy
frogmen. The Navy refused to comment on those allegations.

   The Shedd Aquarium is building a huge, $43 million
oceanarium, but it's having trouble obtaining whales to fill the
complex amid waves of protest from activists opposed to capturing
the mammals.
   ``These captures raise havoc with the wild whale population. They
disrupt the family units, other whales are injured and some are
killed,'' said Edward Morlan, director of the Midwest Whale
Protection Federation.
   The federation is one of eight animal rights and environmental
groups that filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in
Washington to block the aquarium from importing from Japan three
Pacific black whales, also known as false killer whales.
   The lawsuit comes a week after Canada's government refused the
aquarium's request for permission to buy three beluga whales from
Hudson Bay-area Eskimos.
   Neither species is considered endangered.
   Despite the objections, there will be whales in the complex when
it opens in fall 1990, said aquarium Associate Director David
Lonsdale.
   ``We were surprised over the controversy,'' Lonsdale said. ``We
feel we are conservationists. We preach conservation in all of our
messages.''
   He said the Canadians were concerned more about where the whales
would be kept before the exhibit opened, and not the exhibit space
itself. The aquarium has said the whales will be housed at an
aquarium outside Chicago while its Oceanarium is completed.
   The Shedd will reapply for a Canadian permit next year, Lonsdale
said.
   As envisioned, the Oceanarium will be a 170,000-square-foot
exhibit with a 2 million-gallon pool for the false killer whales and
a 400,000-gallon pool for the belugas. The $43 million construction
cost is coming from a variety of sources, including state aid.
   The lawsuit said the federal permit Shedd received for importing
the animals from Japan should be revoked until that country bans its
fishermen from killing whales.
   The Japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore and
slaughter them with harpoons or knives, sparing a few for sale to
aquariums, said Sandy Goldberg, an attorney for the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
   Ms. Goldberg said the Department of Commerce permit violates a
U.S. law banning the importation of marine mammals from countries
that don't give the animals the same protection they have in the
United States.
   ``We want to protect the wild populations and stop the killings
in Japan,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``This is no way to do it _ by paying
them to save a few.''
   The other plaintiffs are Greenpeace USA, the Humane Society of
the United States, the American Humane Association, the
International Wildlife Coalition, the Cetacean Society International
and the Animal Protection Institute of America.
   Aquarium officials deny any laws were broken. They contend that
if they didn't import the whales, the animals would be slaughtered,
and that the exhibits benefit people who have no other place to
learn about the creatures.
   ``We're serving an important function,'' Lonsdale said. ``The
educational value of the exhibits is they help people understand
conservationist concerns.''
   While the plaintiffs acknowledge the exhibits help increase
awareness of the whales' plight, many say they oppose confining
creatures that normally range thousands of miles.
   Education ``can't take priority over protecting the animals in
the wild,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``We don't want to protect the whales
by putting them all in aquariums.''
   Lonsdale countered that the aquarium handles marine animals with
utmost care.
   ``We feel we do the best job we can of keeping'' the animals, he
said. ``Their life here is very good. They have a very pleasant
existence.''

Yielding to pressure from animal rights activists, the New England Aquarium on 
Monday dropped plans to trade an aggressive dolphin to the Navy's dolphin 
training program in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The move settled a federal lawsuit filed last month by Citizens to End Animal 
Suffering and Exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which sought to block the trade, claims the Navy trains dolphins for 
hazardous duty. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the aquarium arranged to trade Rainbow, an 11-year-old, 
450-pound male, to the Naval Oceans Systems Research Center in San Diego for a 
partly deaf female dolphin.

<P>
The Navy center said it trains and studies marine mammals in underwater 
surveillance and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The aquarium decided to resolve the dispute by agreeing with the Navy to end 
the deal, aquarium director John Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed publicly to take a second look at alternative facilities, and we've 
done so in good faith," Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
The aquarium wanted to find a new home for Rainbow because he had become 
incompatible with its other show dolphins.

   Rescuers frustrated by a delayed
icebreaking barge opted for a new plan to free three trapped
whales: using a helicopter to drop a 4{-ton concrete slab that
could punch a trail through foot-thick ice today.
   ``A large, wide lead has opened four miles from the whales.
That's the closest open water there's been yet,'' Ron Morris of the
National Marine Fisheries Service said Thursday. ``I just want to
take advantage of the situation.''
   Weather forecasts indicated that favorable winds would shift
over the weekend, probably shutting the pathways through the ice,
Morris said.
   Officials said they planned to have a giant Alaska Army National
Guard Skycrane helicopter lift the concrete ``crusher'' _ left over
from the construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline _ at first
light today. The trip was expected to take about two hours.
   The Guard has not abandoned its effort to tow the 185-ton
``hover-barge'' 230 miles to Barrow. But the two Guard Skycranes
that towed the barge Thursday have managed to move it just six
miles from the dock at Prudhoe Bay in two days.
   The tow was to have begun Monday, but was stymied by sub-zero
temperatures, darkness, mud, fueling and too much weight. And after
those problems were solved, the helicopters found the going tough
in the shallow, muddy bay just outside the oil field.
   By nightfall Thursday, a desolate stretch of more than 224 miles
remained between the barge and the whales.
   The California gray whales, whose species is endangered, were
trapped during their annual migration about 100 yards off the
treeless Arctic Ocean coast more than two weeks ago by the
constantly shifting ice pack. They have been breathing through
small air holes about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo
village.
   Volunteers have been using ice picks, chain saws and de-icers
donated by a Minnesota family business to enlarge the two original
holes and punch new ones in the ice.
   A new breathing hole was cut Thursday and a tarp was placed over
the largest of the original holes, said biologist Geoff Carroll of
the North Slope Borough.
   ``The whales came up in a hole they've never used before. That's
the first significant progress we've made in moving them, so I
think we'll go full bore on it,'' Carroll said as he headed for
another all-night vigil on the ice.
   The rescuers have recordings of killer whale calls and gray
whale mating calls to scare or lure the trapped whales toward the
open sea.
   The animals don't seem to be as lethargic as they were earlier
this week, Morris said. ``They look nice,'' he said. ``I have hope
that the whales will be around when we try to break through.''
   Even though the whales have been trapped for more than two
weeks, Morris still believes they have a 50-50 chance of making it
to their winter feeding grounds in the warm waters off Southern
California and Mexico.
   Biologists named the whales Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone _ the
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice. Eskimos
have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole) and
Kanik (Snowflake).
   At a news conference Thursday, North Slope Borough Acting Mayor
Warren Matumeak said the borough is committed to freeing the
animals, even though Barrow is a whaling village.
   Gray whales are not normally harvested by the villagers, who
rely instead mostly on bowhead whales.
   ``No one has more respect for our native animals than the local
hunters, and we only take what we need to put food on our tables,''
Matumeak said.
   ``We do not like to see animals suffer, and we do not kill for
sport. These whales are suffering and need our help. We feel a duty
to do what we can and we'll see this effort through.''

   Time is running out for three California
gray whales trapped in the thickening ice of the Arctic Ocean, and
the discussion Saturday was turning from rescue to humane
destruction.
   The young whales have been stranded for more than a week by new
ice about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo community. The
mammals are in shallow water only a few hundred feet offshore,
where they have been rising to the surface every couple of minutes
to breath through small _ and shrinking _ holes in the ice.
   They are four to five miles from open water.
   ``The ice around the whales has become pretty solid,'' said
Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist with the North Slope Borough.
``You can walk right up to the edge and take a look.
   ``They've been bumping up against the ice and their heads are
scraped and cut. Taking a closer look at them, I don't think they
have more than a week or so to go,'' Carroll said.
   Biologists have said they feared the breathing holes could
freeze over or be slammed shut by the drifting ice.
   ``The wind had kind of changed yesterday, coming more from the
northwest, which isn't good,'' Carroll said. ``That could close the
major lead and if that closes, then all our (rescue) efforts are
pretty futile.''
   No icebreaking vessels are closer than 200 miles, and
suggestions ranging from blasting a trail through the ice to the
open sea, or tranquilizing the whales to somehow move them to
freedom have been discussed and discarded, biologists said.
   The Alaska Army National Guard, meanwhile, authorized the use
Saturday of a huge Skycrane helicopter which is capable of lifting
up to 25,000 pounds of cargo.
   The helicopter is to be used to transport a ``hoverbarge'' from
the Prudhoe Bay oilfields to where the whales are trapped near
Barrow, a distance of about 200 miles, said Mike Haller, a guard
spokesman.
   ``We'll be heading north at first light tomorrow,'' Haller said.
``It probably will take us all day to move from here (Anchorage) to
Prudhoe. Then we'll go to work to get the barge to Barrow. We could
be there sometime Monday afternoon.''
   If things go as planned, the icebreaking barge would be used to
clear a path to open water, Haller said.
   ``We don't know how much time we have, but we understand it's
(situation) getting pretty critical,'' Haller said.
   The people in Barrow, who harvest a small number of larger
bowhead whales each season for food and other uses, have begun
talking about the possibility of killing the whales if they remain
trapped much longer.
   ``I don't want to make any attempt to speak for everybody up
here, but couple of (whaling) boat captains I talked to said if the
whales can't be gotten out of the ice, they'd hate to watch them
suffer,'' Carroll said.
   ``They'd rather quickly and efficiently put them out of their
misery than watch them die a slow and agonizing death. With the
stress they've been under, the meat's not going to be of a very
good quality, anyway.
   ``It's a desire to put them out of their misery rather than an
attempt to harvest them,'' Carroll said.
   Arnold Brower, a village elder and whaling captain, said
community leaders want to meet with government officials this
weekend to sort out the options.
   ``It looks like they haven't rested for a long period of time,''
Brower said. ``They're struggling there. They're just like we are,
fighting for survival.
   ``We have to do something. Decide to put them to sleep or help
them out.''
   Gray whales generally spend their summers feeding in the
Beaufort Sea off Alaska's North Slope, then migrate south through
the Bering Strait in the fall.
   They spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico and
Southern California.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Subtle shift in the
relationship - Warburg and MAM
</HEADLINE>

When SG Warburg sold off a quarter of its holding in Mercury Asset
Management in 1986, it was trying to make a point.
Not only did it want to reap some of the value of its fast-growing fund
management arm, it wished to underscore the independence of MAM. At a time
when too many questions were being asked about dealings between the fund
management and stock brokerage arms of merchant banks, independence seemed
like a good message to send to the public.
Warburg has underlined the message by siting its headquarters in Finsbury
Avenue in the City of London and those of MAM just on the edge near London
Bridge.
Now, officials at Warburg may well be wondering whether MAM has become a
little too independent. With a potentially valuable merger between Warburg
and US investment bank Morgan Stanley thwarted by the independence of MAM
directors, the relationship between the two firms may be permanently
altered.
'MAM have always seen themselves as very independent of Warburg. Not only
for regulatory reasons but because their business in character is very
different from that of Warburg,' said a fund manager at a rival firm. 'At
the level of the MAM board, they will not welcome losing their
independence.'
Neither Warburg nor MAM would comment on suggestions that the Morgan Stanley
deal has badly strained relations between the two. 'There are relationships
here which go back 20 years,' one MAM insider said.
But the head of a rival fund management firm argues that 'there must be some
bad blood between those two buildings'.
'There are bound to be a few recriminations,' adds Mr Philip Gibbs,
securities industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
And, industry experts say, MAM may well emerge with the upper hand. Over the
past seven years, MAM has consistently accounted for the lion's share of
Warburg's earnings, Mr Gibbs notes. Any effort by Warburg to force MAM
directors to toe the line could encourage the departure of some of its
leading lights - thus undermining MAM's value. Within Warburg, MAM has its
own board and executive committee, and considerable autonomy in setting its
own strategy and expansion. Its executive committee reports to the Warburg
board, of which its chairman, Mr Hugh Stevenson, is a member.
MAM has periodically asserted its independence in ways that have proven
embarrassing to Warburg. For instance, MAM directors were so irritated at
the way Warburg handled the purchase of shares in oil company Lasmo, for
which the bank's client, Enterprise, was making a hostile bid, that it cut
its dealing with Warburg's brokerage arm for several weeks.
MAM and Warburg are now both expected to mull the contentious issue of
whether the minority stake in the fund management company ought to be
purchased by Warburg. One objective would be to ensure that MAM cannot
thwart a marriage should another suitor emerge.
Alternatively, some analysts suggest that Warburg may wish to sell its MAM
holding and re-invest the capital in its investment banking business.
