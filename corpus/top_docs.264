   Mixed in with the ads for trusses and
carousel music in the 199th Old Farmer's Almanac are predictions
for a cold, snowy winter and advice on helping a baby grow: Put
manure in the infant's shoes.
   The 224-page, 199th edition hits newsstands and supermarkets
this week with its traditional weather predictions, planting and
tide tables, anecdotes and folklor.
   It claims 80 percent accuracy in its weather forecasts, but
editor and part-owner Judson Hale says that figure is not cast in
stone.
   ``I can't in seriousness say 80 percent,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his Dublin office. He missed the Midwest
drought in 1988.
   Nevertheless, the almanac is predicting a ``real old-fashioned
winter'' east of the Rockies with below-normal temperatures over
much of the country except Florida, sections of the Ohio and lower
Mississippi valleys and the Northwest.
   Florida, it predicts, will have warmer than normal weather in
February and March.
   The almanac also forecasts a generally warmer spring and summer
than normal, but a cool and wet fall.
   The almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a
secret formula devised by its founder and the ``most modern
scientific calculation based on solar activity.''
   Hale also strays into earthquake forecasts, noting that the moon
will be 221,545 miles from the Earth on New Year's Eve, closer than
its average of 251,000 miles.
   ``Some people would believe it would have an influence on an
earthquake if an earthquake was thinking about happening,'' he
said. Believers argue that when the moon is closer and its
gravitational pull is stronger, there is greater stress on rock
layers that might rupture and cause a quake.
   The almanac even offers folklore advice on babies. On
conception, the almanac offers this folk wisdom: If a woman lays
her hat or coat on a strange bed, she will have a child.
   To have a boy, she should hold a nickel in her mouth at the time
of conception. To make the baby grow tall, folksters suggest
putting manure in the child's shoes.
   The yellow-covered Old Farmer's Almanac has changed little since
it was first published in 1792.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.
   ``It does indicate it is, in a sense, a calendar,'' Hale says.
   Hale spent the summer scouring previous issues for lore to
include in an expanded 200th anniversary edition next year.
   ``I'm up to 1931,'' he said. ``I have 65 pages of notes.''

Lobsters</HEAD>

   The 197th edition of the Old Farmer's
Almanac contains a forecast for a white Christmas in the East, a
prediction of woe for Red Sox fans, and former Sen. Edmund Muskie's
technique for mesmerizing lobsters.
   Published in tiny Dublin, N.H., the oldest continuously
published almanac in the United States hits newsstands today with
its usual, homey brand of ``new, useful and entertaining matter''
for the 9 million readers it claims.
   A competing Farmer's Almanac, which is marking its 55th year,
was released earlier this month. That publication is sold to banks,
insurance companies and other businesses for distribution to
customers as a promotion and claims a circulation of more than 5
million.
   Started in 1792, the 224-page Old Farmer's Almanac also contains
its usual fearless extended weather forecast for 1989 for 16 U.S.
regions.
   Editor Judson Hale claims 80 percent accuracy with the secret
formula and the ``most modern scientific calculation based on solar
activity,'' although it failed to predict last summer's devastating
drought.
   Looking ahead, the almanac predicts heavy snow starting around
Thanksgiving from Chicago to New England and down the East Coast,
with a frigid December in some sections before temperatures rise
and the weather dries.
   That means a white Christmas, but ``snow stopping in time for
cork popping'' at New Year's.
   While New England, southern Florida and the desert Southwest
should prepare for below-normal temperatures, the rest of the
country will get a warmer winter than usual.
   For the summer, the almanac calls for cooler, wetter weather
along the East Coast, normal temperatures in New England, Florida
and the Deep South, and drier weather in the Ohio Valley through
Chicago, Texas, Oklahoma and the Pacific Coast.
   But for the often-disappointed fans of Boston's beloved Red Sox,
next September's forecast is the most crucial: It comes with the
warning, ``Sox in first, expect the worst.''
   The familiar black and yellow publication, punctuated this year
with sporty red highlights, again offers predictions for consumers,
who can expect fake caviar, low-calorie tortilla chips, scented
newspaper ads and the ``ultimate indignity'' _ garbage rationing _
in the coming 15 months.
   The casual reader may also be drawn to educational features,
such as the ``straight facts about warts'' and ways to get rid of
them ranging from ``bizarre and complicated'' to ``extremely
disgusting'' and ``downright criminal.''
   Muskie, the former Democratic senator from Maine and U.S.
secretary of state, offered a followup to a 1984 article on
hypnotizing chickens with his own ``foolproof ways to hypnotize a
lobster.''
   By stroking the tail in a downward motion, ``curling it as you
go,'' he said, you can impress friends by getting the lobster to do
a claw stand on its head.
   A vigorous shake should bring the lobster back to its senses,
but if that doesn't work, Muskie wrote, just whisper in its ear,
``Drawn butter, drawn butter.''

   After watching his half-acre of grass wither
and dry this spring, Witham Smith wrote a letter to the ``Old
Farmer's Almanac.''
   Smith, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the
196-year-old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's
drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end.
   He received a pretty dry answer from Judson D. Hale Sr., editor
of the almanac.
   ``We didn't predict that it was coming and we can't predict when
it will end,'' Hale wrote Smith, who lives in suburban Terrace Park.
   The almanac claims to be 80 percent accurate, but Hale
acknowledged that it doesn't predict weather for spring and summer
too well.
   This year, it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than
normal in the Greater Ohio Valley. Heavy rain was predicted for
June 14 to 17.
   The almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six
to 18 months in advance. The predictions are based on such
information as changes in sun spots, the size of polar ice caps,
and the location of warm water currents.
   ``Our 1989 edition will be published in November. It is really
hard to nail down the weather for spring and summer that far in
advance because so many things happen,'' Hale said.
   ``They have been a little off before, but never this far,''
Smith said. ``They said we would be about half an inch off, but not
a drought like this.''

   Rest easy America! Abe Weatherwise,
prognosticator of the Old Farmer's Almanac, says it'll be a mild
winter across most of the country. And New Englanders can expect a
white Christmas.
   Abe, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's oldest
continuously published periodical,'' says only the northern third
of the country will have more snow than usual.
   The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac hits the newsstands
and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide
tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100 ways how to avoid
untimely death. (No. 49. Avoid combing hair in the dark; No. 77.
Never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will be
balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
   The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In Canada, where 300,000 of the 4 million copies of the
customary yellow-covered almanac will be sold, heavier than average
snow is forecast from Quebec through the prairie provinces.
   ``The more serious the weather, the larger percentage we sell,''
says Executive Editor Tim Clark. ``They count on us more in Alberta
than in Alabama.''
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is the legal document for tides and
sunrises and sunsets in most states. In addition to giving readers
weather predictions, advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets
of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie, the
almanac advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the
popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   The almanac also predicts the return of 4-inch-wide neckties for
men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a

its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book

   When people meet Judson Hale, they are almost always
disappointed. "They expect me to be wearing overalls," said
the editor of The Old Farmer's Almanac, which just came out
with its 200th edition, further cementing its position as the
oldest continuously published periodical in the U.S. "But
I've worn a coat and tie since the third grade."
   They expect him to be a farmer (Mr. Hale grew up on a farm
but avoided farming. "I would go down to the barn and WATCH,"
he said); they expect him to talk with a Maine accent (Mr.
Hale is of Boston Brahmin stock); they expect him to be
aphoristic ("Red sky at morning; sailors take warning" is not
the sort of thing that springs readily to Mr. Hale's lips).
And they expect him to be old. "I'm fulfilling that part
now," the 58-year-old Mr. Hale said cheerfully.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, Mr. Hale doesn't bother his head much about the
expectations of strangers and of talk-show hosts who are
always importuning him to appear on their programs holding a
rake. He has an almanac to put out, a task that seems to grow
more daunting every year. "I'm always scared to death when we
start a new issue," said Mr. Hale, who as 12th editor of the
Almanac is known in certain circles as Jud XII. "You can only
be as good as the last one. The 200th edition seems to have
been received well but I'm now nervous about 1993 and people
being let down.
   "I don't care if I disappoint marketing people or our
public relations people. I value advertisers, but my first
and foremost concern is for the readers and how they feel
about the publication."
   Indeed, readers have extremely strong feelings about The
Old Farmer's Almanac, which is, as it has been since
Washington's presidency, a compendium of weather forecasts,
astronomical calculations, recipes, planting tables and "new,
useful and entertaining matter" like "How to Get Rich Without
Doing Any Work," "What Hardly Anyone Knows About Ellis
Island," "The Facts and Fictions About Death Valley" and
"Peace and Hominy: Some Thoughts on Grits."
   According to Mr. Hale, longtime devotees of the Almanac
write or call the Dublin, N.H.-based publication to check the
optimum time for having surgery (folklore has it that one can
expect more bleeding when the moon is full). They weigh in --
with triumph -- when they catch mistakes in the sunrise
tables. And they make their feelings known -- with vigor --
when the Almanac makes unwarranted changes. "Dear Sir," a
Texas reader once wrote, "I have read The Old Farmer's
Almanac for the last 75 years and I wish the damned fool that
changed the reading of the moon's column had died before he
done it. Yours, respectfully."
   "People expect The Old Farmer's Almanac to BE The Old
Farmer's Almanac," said Mr. Hale, who's been editor for the
past 21 years. "I think readers feel they own it, that it's
one of their inalienable rights as long as they can come up
with the $2.95 to pay for it.
   "I think everyone who works at the Almanac sees it as a
responsibility," he added. "It's like owning a 17th-century
house. You shouldn't add a porch to it because the house
belongs to American architectural heritage as much as it
belongs to the present owners."
   Mr. Hale's success as editor -- the 1991 OFA sold four
million copies with sales of six million projected for '92 --
can be partly explained by his strong identification with
readers, partly by his strong identification with the Almanac
itself. "I think Jud embodies the values the Almanac has
represented for so long," said John Pierce, publisher of the
OFA. "He believes that if you work hard you'll do well, that
it's important to be part of your community, that by staying
in touch with some aspect of the natural world we stay in
touch with ourselves, and that man is inherently a decent
species -- and those are all the values of the Almanac."
   Then, of course, there is the short explanation, that Mr.
Hale is simply adhering to the policy set forth by the
Almanac's founding editor, Robert B. Thomas: "Our endeavor is
to be useful but with a pleasant degree of humor."
   Mr. Hale was born in Boston and grew up on a communal
organic farm in Vanceboro, Me., a venture that was largely
funded by his parents, adherents of the Austrian scientist
and philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Educated at Dartmouth, he
cast about for a career until deciding in 1959 to accept the
offer of employment from his uncle Robb Sagendorph, then
editor of the OFA and its sister publication, the magazine
Yankee.
   Since the beginning of his tenure as editor, Mr. Hale has
had to confront several misconceptions about the Almanac,
among them the belief that the periodical -- with its
signature yellow cover festooned with woodcuts, rococo
scrollwork, cameos and antiquated typography -- is a
nostalgia book. "It isn't," Mr. Hale said flatly. "I want
people when they read the Almanac 100 years from now to look
at the 1992 edition and know what life in the U.S. was like
in 1992. And they will. There are television trends and
fashion trends and the current state of the Earth.
   The most enduring misconception about the Almanac, said
Mr. Hale, is the belief that its raison d'etre is weather
forecasting. "It's 24 pages out of every issue and costs
$100,000 a year, which is more expensive than any other 24
pages," he said. "But it isn't the major reason for the
Almanac's existence and it never was."
   About those weather forecasts. They are the work of
Richard Head, a former NASA scientist, who relies on current
and historical solar observations along with space-probe data
to come up with predictions that are, he calculates, about
70% accurate.
   "We say our predictions are 80% accurate," amended Mr.
Hale, who is astonishingly adept at bending the weather to
fit the Almanac's forecasts. If, for example, he's giving a
speech in a region told to expect "cool, cloudy, chance of
showers" and things turn out hot, dry and sunny, well, the
waggish editor is ready to explain. "The air conditioner is
on so it's cool," he'll begin. "And I didn't get much sleep
so everything is cloudy, and we all took showers this morning
so we're on our way to 80% accuracy."
   Marginally imperfect (ahem) though its forecasting may be,
the Almanac sells briskly to prospective brides who want to
pinpoint the sunniest Saturday in June. Others are more
inclined to buy it for the recipes or for tips on growing
impressive vegetables. Some buy it just to hang up (the
Almanac has a hole in the upper left corner to accommodate
just such people). And there are those people who buy the
Almanac simply because it is 200 years old. "If this were the
fifth-anniversary issue it wouldn't be selling even half what
it is," said Mr. Hale.
   Clearly, Mr. Hale hopes to turn the curious into converts.
"I think we feel we're doing some good," he said. "The Old
Farmer's Almanac is a constant. With things in the world
changing as fast as they are, we feel we're giving people a
lift."
   They are. Wherever Mr. Hale travels carrying the little
yellow book, people nod and smile fondly. "The Old Farmer's
Almanac," they say, "My grandmother used to read that."

Instead</HEAD>

   The Farmers' Almanac expects to see a
little less snow and a lot less drought next year, but what the
172-year-old digest of Americana really wants to see less of is
pennies.
   The penny, inspiration for homely expressions that have been a
staple of almanacs since Benjamin Franklin set up shop _ ``A penny
saved is a penny earned'' is one _ has outlived its usefulness,
concludes the 1989 edition of the Farmer's Almanac.
   ``Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny.
But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,'' the almanac says, living
down its reputation as a defender of long-held values.
   Instead, editor Ray Geiger has proposed a new coin worth 12{
cents, or one ``bit.''
   ``I can't think of anything you can buy with a penny. The penny
candy is all a nickel,'' said Geiger, who with varying degrees of
success has led the publication's previous campaigns to restore
city names to postmarks, eliminate the nine-digit ZIP code and
print currency in colors other than green.
   ``You see a penny on the street and you no longer bother to pick
it up,'' and young children often find it's no longer worth their
time and effort to empty jars of pennies and package them in
50-cent rolls, Geiger said in a recent interview.
   Also in the newly released edition is a prediction for another
``cold and mean'' winter, but not as rough as the last one, with a
little less snow in the Midwest and the Rockies.
   The summer of 1989 should be more pleasant, with drier than
average weather but no repeat of this year's drought, according to
Geiger. ``We didn't predict the drought, but neither did anybody
else,'' he said.
   But what really gets Geiger heated up is the persistence of the
penny, whose purchasing power has diminished to the point where its
only uses are making change and collecting sales taxes, according
to the almanac.
   The almanac's plan for the bit _ a name derived from ``two
bits,'' the colloquial expression for a quarter _ takes into
account the change in monetary values.
   ``This perceives the dollar as being cut into eight equal
pieces, half a dollar is four bits, 75 cents is six bits,'' the
almanac said. It points out that while U.S. money is based on the
decimal system, stock markets routinely list prices in increments
of one-eighth of a dollar.
   The U.S. Mint churns out billions of pennies each year, and the
almanac suggests that as many as 200 billion of the coins may be
squirreled away in vaults, baby banks, cookie jars and shoe boxes.
   The almanac says the introduction of the bit would bridge the
gap between the dime and the quarter, for greater flexibility in
coin combinations that would produce 22{ cents, 27{ cents and so
forth, all the way up to 97{ cents.
   To promote the idea, the almanac suggests a gold-toned coin that
would be about as thick as a dime, midway in size between the
nickel and the quarter.
   The Treasury Department declined to embrace the recommendation,
saying there has been no groundswell of support for a change.
   ``We've periodically examined the penny, and right now the
department has no plans to eliminate it. It's still an integral
part of the coinage system,'' said spokeswoman Felice Pelosi.
   Undaunted, Geiger said he was prepared to travel to Washington
to solicit support for the change.
   ``Some people will think this is a nutty idea, but they thought
it was a nutty idea to bring back the old postmark, and that was a
singlehanded victory for the Farmers' Almanac,'' he said.
   Geiger's almanac, which is sold to banks, insurance companies
and other businesses for distribution to customers as a promotion,
claims a circulation of more than 5 million.
   Its 48 pages are a compendium of calendar data, household hints,
one-line jokes, inspirational messages, recipes and, of course,
weather predictions derived through a secret formula by the
almanac's forecaster, Caleb Weatherbee.
   Geiger, who turns 78 this month, is marking his 55th year as
almanac editor, a tenure he says ties the record established by the
original editor of the Old Farmers Almanac, a New Hampshire-based
publication founded in 1792.

   Not one to tamper lightly with tradition,
the Farmers' Almanac suggests nonetheless that the date designated
for Thanksgiving is a turkey.
   In its 1991 edition, just off the presses, the venerable
publication says Americans should consider celebrating the holiday,
the fourth Thursday in November, earlier in the fall.
   An earlier date would rid Thanksgiving of pre-Christmas
overtones, allow for more favorable travel weather and line it up
more closely with the harvest whose bounty it is meant to
celebrate, the almanac says.
   The almanac says the second Monday in October, the date on which
Canada celebrates Thanksgiving, might be an appropriate
alternative. Almanac editor Ray Geiger invites readers to offer
their own ideas.
   ``We're only suggesting that we examine this thing. We're not
bold enough to say `do it!''' Geiger said in an interview.
   Thanksgiving, commemorating the feast held by members of the
Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in December 1621 to celebrate that
year's harvest, has been observed at various dates over the years.
It has remained at its current date since 1863, except for a brief
period when President Franklin D. Roosevelt reset it for the third
Thursday in November.
   ``Thanksgiving is a sacred holiday. What makes it sacrosanct is
not that it is observed on a certain date each year, but rather
what it means,'' the almanac says. ``When one ponders the real
reason for Thanksgiving, the date of celebration seems immaterial.''
   Geiger said the principal reason for change would be to separate
Thanksgiving from the overlapping demands posed by the start of the
Christmas season.
   ``You've got football, you've got Christmas pressing and you
don't know whether you're celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas,''
he said.
   An earlier holiday would reduce the chances that travelers would
encounter ice or snow while heading to family gatherings, Geiger
said. And it would shift the holiday to a time closer to the end of
the harvest, when the woods still are ablaze with colorful foliage,
he said.
   By contrast, fields and orchards are bare in late November and
trees have lost their leaves. ``When we celebrate Thanksgiving
under these conditions, we seem to have lost our sense of timing,''
the almanac said.
   The date change could mark the start of a new crusade by the
174-year-old almanac, which in years past has prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks and eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code.
   Geiger's almanac is not to be confused with the Old Farmers
Almanac, the 198-year-old New Hampshire-based publication. Geiger
claims a circulation of about 5 million for the 48-page
publication, sold to banks, insurance companies and other
businesses that distribute it to customers as a promotional tool.
   Last year's campaign promoting the introduction of a coin it
calls the Columbus Dollar as a replacement for the $1 bill is
making progress, Geiger said, and bills introduced in the House and
Senate are enjoying increased support.
   That proposal, along with the shuffling of Thanksgiving, does
not mean that the almanac is abandoning its longstanding profession
of traditional values.
   ``Tradition is a must for us, but we're not blinded by it,''
Geiger said.
   Almanac traditions include calendar data, puzzles, household
hints, inspirational messages, one-line jokes and ``flavorite
recipes.''
   Another tradition is weather data. This year's edition predicts
a harsh winter _ chilling news to households concerned about rising
energy prices brought on by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's going to be a rough winter, rougher than last year, with
more snow and more cold weather in January and February,'' Geiger
said.
   ``But it's not going to be a prolonged winter. It's going to
ease off early in March,'' Geiger said. The almanac forecasts a
mild spring and summer that won't be too hot.
   The forecasts are prepared by Caleb Weatherbee, who calculates
them in accordance with a secret formula based on sunspots, the
position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon, Geiger
said.
   ``His track record has been excellent, getting better every
year.''

   The Farmers' Almanac, renewing its crusade
to revamp the nation's coinage and currency, is promoting a $1 coin
to replace the dollar bill to pinch a few pennies for Uncle Sam and
taxpayers.
   The almanac's 1990 edition, just off the presses, also calls for
the elimination of the penny and 50-cent piece. The new $1 coin
could be called the Columbus Dollar, honoring the explorer who
discovered the New World, the publication said.
   The almanac endorses a bill introduced by Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., to direct the Treasury to mint and circulate the Columbus
Dollar and halt production of the $1 bill 18 months after the coin
is placed in circulation.
   Under the new system, the little-used $2 bill likely would become
the most popular piece of currency, says almanac editor Ray Geiger.
   Geiger maintains that the new system would create a coinage and
currency system that reflects contemporary values and lifestyles.
   He quotes the Federal Reserve as saying replacement of the $1
bill by the $1 coin would save the Treasury more than $120 million a
year.
   ``It costs approximately 2.6 cents to print a $1 bill and the
bill lasts about 18 months before it goes to the shredder. It costs
3{ cents to mint a $1 coin, but the coin will last 20 years,'' he
said.
   ``The Farmers' Almanac, 173 years old, has always been a champion
of the common man, and we think the common man is entitled to
protect his right to a coinage that's sensible and realistic,'' he
said in an interview.
   Geiger's publication, not to be confused with the 197-year-old
New Hampshire-based Old Farmers Almanac, has previously prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks, eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code and print currency in colors other than green.
   Geiger, who claims a circulation of more than 5 million, said
this year's 48-page almanac contains the usual mix of calendar data,
household hints, one-line jokes and inspirational messages.
   It also has weather predictions by prognosticator Caleb
Weatherbee that are based on ``a secret formula based on sunspots,
the position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon.''
   Weatherbee predicts that the winter of 1989-90 will be milder
than usual with less snow, while next summer will be pleasant with
moderate rainfall.
   The campaign for the $1 coin follows last year's proposal for a
new coin worth 12{ cents _ or one ``bit.'' As Geiger saw it, the bit
would bridge the gap between the dime and quarter. That suggestion
didn't catch on.
   But the almanac remains adamant that the penny has got to go,
saying most of the 200 billion in circulation simply gather dust in
shoe boxes and piggy banks. It suggests that sales be rounded off to
the nearest nickel.
   On the $1 coin, Geiger said the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin
failed to become popular because it was not easily distinguished
from the quarter and because it was introduced as an alternative to
the paper dollar, rather than a replacement.
   The almanac even has a design ready for a new $1 coin. Art
director Ed Greenwood drew a sample coin that features a portrait of
the explorer on one side and two of his ships on the other.
   The almanac suggests that the coin be gold toned, 1[ inches in
diameter, ungrooved or unribbed on the edges, with the thickness of
a quarter. It would also be light _ .015 ounce, or one-quarter the
weight of the old silver dollar.

<TEXT>     I recently saw a copy of an old "Poor Richard's Almanac," and I was struck
by how similar it was in its arrangement and style to another almanac that is
only slightly less historic, but is still published today: "The Old Farmer's
Almanac.";   In fact, this new year marks the 200th anniversary of the
beginning of "The Old Farmer's Almanac," and it may also be a good time for us
to consider this wonderful piece of Americana as a worthwhile and inexpensive
addition to our collection of home learning resources.;    THE TYPES of home
resources that I have been promoting as good acquisitions for "family
learning" activities are those that either inspire interest in learning or
confirm various learnings that were stimulated elsewhere, or both. A family
dictionary, for example, can be used to investigate a pronunciation or a word
usage that you heard on television, but that word (perhaps its spelling,
definition, or derivation) can lead you to investigate other words as well,
and you can come back from your trip to the dictionary with much more than you
went looking to find.;   I think "The Old Farmer's Almanac" fits this same
bill because it enables, as well as encourages, its readers to learn from the
world around them. Forget the weather predictions, which were of greater
interest and utility in centuries past, but are now mainly just a curiosity
for most readers, including farmers.;   Look instead at the wealth of
information about topics like astronomy, geography and history that can be
found here and probably not in any other single learning resource. The almanac
gives you the precise times for the rising and setting of the sun and the
moon, the position of each major constellation, the phases of the moon, the
time and place of eclipses and meteor showers during the year.;   But there is
more than astronomy here, for you'll also find the exact longitude and
latitude for hundreds of cities in the United States and Canada, as well as
items of historical interest for each day of the year, and many well-written
essays that can inspire family discussions and activities.;   YOU SEE, this
almanac -- like the family dictionary or a globe or an atlas -- can be a
springboard for all types of learning that can go on around the house. This is
what Franklin's almanac did for our colonial ancestors, but we are more
fortunate in that we can use our almanac in conjunction with other home and
school and library resources to acquire an education that "is both broad and
deep.";   This 1992 "Old Farmer's Almanac" is of special value in family
learning because it is the bicentennial edition, and it includes several
features that focus on the events of the last 200 years, and especially on the
way things were in 1792, when the first edition of the almanac was published,
when George Washington was president, when the average age in the country was
16, and when the almanac sold for sixpence.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Folksy Almanac Takes on Big-City Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, the folksy,
old-fashioned American tradition, has taken on New York Magazine,
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city.
   The 199-year-old Almanac filed a trademark infringement lawsuit
Wednesday accusing the magazine of imitating the Almanac's
distinctive cover design with the Dec. 3 issue.
   The Almanac's publisher, Yankee Publishing Inc. of Dublin, N.H.,
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to
believe the Almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its use by
New York Magazine.
   The lawsuit said the magazine, by imitating its trademarked
cover, had ``impaired the value of Yankee's cover design and the
goodwill symbolized by it.''
   Susan Soriano, a spokeswoman for the magazine, said the magazine
had not received the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
   The disputed cover, titled ``The 1990 Christmas Gifts Almanac,''
promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays. It is
illustrated in a similar design as used by the Almanac.
   Yankee accuses the magazine of copying, among other things, the
overall distinctive yellow color, the use of red and green
highlights and a red and white border, and a nearly identical style
of typeface.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks an
order barring the magazine from using the design in the future. It
also seeks unspecified damages.
   The Almanac has been published annually since 1792.

   Gary Liubakka is a newcomer to politics,
but he figures he's bound to get a hefty vote in next year's
gubernatorial race.
   That's because he's running as founder of the National Apathetic
Party. With a 60 percent voter turnout expected in the 1990
election, Liubakka can claim the other 40 percent of the electorate
as constituents.
   ``They won't vote, and a `no' vote is a vote for me,'' the
36-year-old contractor said recently.
   The unofficial party _ it's known as NAP _ even has a mascot: a
battered eagle.
   The bird's neck is longer than most eagles' because it's been
stretched a few times. Its left wing is clipped from giving away so
many handouts. Its tail feathers are lost.
   On the rare occasions Liubakka removes his tongue from his
cheek, he'll betray serious worries about the state of the body
politic.
   ``Our intention is to slap everybody in the face with
ignorance,'' the unregistered candidate said, ``and hopefully this
blunt hint will get them out to vote more.''

   The northern third of the country will have
more snow than usual but it'll be a mild winter for most of the
country, says no less an authority than the Old Farmer's Almanac.
   Abe Weatherwise, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's
oldest continuously published periodical,'' predicts a white
Christmas in New England. The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac
hits the newsstands and supermarkets this week with its familiar
planting and tide tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100
ways how to avoid untimely death. (No. 49, avoid combing hair in
the dark; No. 77, never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
   He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will
be balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In addition to weather predictions, the almanac has
advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets of winning lotteries
and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie.
   It also advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost
the popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   Among other predictions: the return of the 4-inch-wide necktie
for men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.

   Most everyone has heard of killer bees and
killer whales _ but what about killer snails?
   One man is determined to prove that the combative cousins of
common garden snails are the answer to eliminating the slow-moving
but voracious plant munchers. Raymond Harrie, 34, sells a hostile
snail breed that he claims will prey on the garden pests.
   ``It's the tough new snail on the block,'' Harrie said the other
day from his demonstration booth at the Los Angeles County Fair.
   The shell-less critters ambush garden snails, following their
slime trails and attacking them when they lay their eggs, Harrie
said. The bloodthirsty snails, known to scientists as Rumina
decollata, usually leave their victims mortally wounded, rather
than killing them outright, he said.
   Harrie, who sells the attack snails for $20 per 100, claims
they're too slow-moving to move from the garden to the house, and
pose no danger to children and pets.

   Punxsutawney Phil, America's premier
groundhog, emerged from his burrow today and indicated in
``unmistakable groundhogese'' that he had failed to spot his
shadow, a sure sign spring is just around the corner, according to
Phil's followers.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said county judge Edwin Snyder. He is a member
of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle, which
each year decides in advance whether Phil will ``see'' his shadow.
   Snyder said Phil ``turned to Groundhog President Jim Means and
signaled to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow
today.'''
   The squirming, 10-pound woodchuck was pulled from his man-made
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at sunrise, 7:27 a.m. Means held the
groundhog up to his ear to hear the once-a-year prediction, then
lifted him toward Snyder.
   The approximately 1,500 people who had gathered under cloudy
skies and in light rain cheered as Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``I've always wanted to come to this event ever since I was a
kid,'' said Peter Teicher, 49, of Los Angeles. ``I'm really
excited. I couldn't sleep last night. It's a real thrill.''
   Other prognasticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead and also failed to see their shadows.
   Legend has it that if the famous groundhog sees his shadow when
he emerges from his bungalow at sunrise on Feb. 2, there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly just
around the corner.
   ``You know and I know that Feb. 2 is too darn early to expect
spring to come,'' said Tim Clark, executive editor of The Old
Farmer's Almanac.
   But the two-legged variety of weather forecasters are still
curious about what Phil has to say on Groundhog Day.
   ``I definitely do watch to see what he does. I didn't say I
believe it. I say I watch it,'' said Albert Peterlin, a hydrologist
for the National Weather Service in Harrisburg.
   ``This has a little bit of history and fact,'' he said.
``Animals respond to temperature and environment as it occurs.''
   Before today, Phil had predicted an early spring only nine times
since 1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in
this small western Pennsylvania town.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
holiday celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to
the temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Means, 66.
   The 14 local businessmen who comprise the Inner Circle decide
well in advance what Phil's forecast will be. Group members stages
several rehearsals before Groundhog Day, when they don top hats and
tails for the event.
   Phil's handler, Bud Dunkel, sported a fake fur hat resembling a
groundhog.
   Every other day of the year, Phil lives at his heated,
air-conditioned hutch at the local library with two other
groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   As far as The Old Farmer's Almanac is concerned, February _ at
least around Punxsutawney _ will be extremely cold and snowy
followed by similar weather in early March.
   The National Weather Service is calling for a warmer than usual
February, but a colder than usual March and April.
   ``If I were to give you the scientific point of view, I think it
would be cold for the rest of this winter,'' said meteorologist
Victor Nouhan. ``Of course, that's worth a grain of salt.''
   Groundhog Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central
Pennsylvania's Quarryville. And neither did West Virginia's Concord
Charlie as he was ``wandering around campus to see if any flowers
are up,'' said Tom Bone, public information director for Concord
College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.

<HEAD>TV Station Surrenders Taped Interview to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television interview with a man whose wife
has been missing since Dec. 8 was seized by police who got a search
warrant to obtain the tape from KTWO-TV, managing editor Charles
Brown said.
   The woman's husband had complained in the interview that police
were spending too much time treating him like a suspect when they
should be searching for his wife.
   On Dec. 18, police seized the taped interview, saying it
``constitutes evidence.''
   Brown said the station decided not to challenge the warrant, in
part because the husband had approached KTWO on his own.
Additionally, station officials didn't think the interview
contained any comments that the man hadn't already made to police,
he said.
   ``Our position was we take this on a case-by-base basis,'' Brown
said. ``I think it just ought to be on a case-by-case basis. I
don't think you should turn stuff over voluntarily, but responding
to a search warrant is different.''
   According to an affidavit that accompanied the warrant, police
wanted the tape because it contained statements made by the husband
that they believe show he concealed a stolen gun and military
equipment found when officers searched the couple's house after she
disappeared.
   Michael Krampner, a lawyer working with the Wyoming Press
Association, said KTWO already had broadcast a portion of the
interview and so there was little argument for confidentiality of
the tape.
   ``As the law now is in Wyoming, journalists are no different
from any other citizens,'' he said. ``If they receive a subpoena to
come to court and tell what they know, they're just like any other
citizen, they have the obligation to respond to that. If a court
issues a valid search warrant ... obviously they have to stand
aside and let them search for it just like any other citizens.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Bill Easing Secrecy of Criminal Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Dec. 17 signed
into law a bill to reduce the secrecy of the state's criminal
records, ending a three-year struggle to overhaul the Criminal
Offender Records Information law.
   The revised law is a compromise between those who wanted the
records opened completely and those who wanted the secrecy
maintained. It will keep records open from one to three years,
depending on the crime and prison sentence.
   As passed in 1972, the law kept virtually all criminal records
secret.
   The drive to change it began in the wake of the Willie Horton
case that became a major issue in the presidential campaign between
Dukakis and George Bush.
   The records law was little known to the public until Horton, a
convicted first-degree murderer from Lawrence, escaped from his
10th prison furlough and went on to rape a young Maryland woman and
stab her fiance repeatedly in March 1987.
   Citing the law, state correction officials refused to say why
they gave Horton weekend passes after he had been sentenced to life
in prison without parole for the slaying of a teen-ager.
   Horton's records were released only after the Lawrence
Eagle-Tribune sued.

   The same charges were dismissed in November after a judge ruled
that the state had insufficient evidence.
   The charges allege that Beitchman, posing as a state deputy
attorney general, made threatening telephone calls to a couple
whose son had been involved in a traffic accident with Beitchman's
brother.
   Prosecutor Ted Fritsch said more evidence had been uncovered,

<HEAD>Report Finds 1990 Unhappy Year for Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year 1990 was an unhappy one for journalists,
with some of the most serious setbacks coming where hope had been
strongest, the International Press Institute reported.
   The institute's World Press Freedom Review paid particular
attention to press difficulties in Romania, Yugoslavia, South
Africa, Turkey, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Chile, Colombia and Iraq.
   ``There has been an increase in attacks on the media, and they
most galling aspect of all is that they are occurring in countries
where we had been given good reason to hope for dramatic changes
for the better,'' IPI Director Peter Galliner wrote in the report
released Dec. 14.
   Galliner said one of 1990's most gruesome incidents was the
execution in Iraq of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist
working for The Observer newspaper of London. Bazoft was accused of
spying.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait silenced about 40 Kuwaiti
publications, the report noted.
   ``Ironically, one consequence of Saddam Hussein's move has been
the opening ... of the Saudi media, which have been obliged to tell
the population the truth, at long last, faced with the evidence all
around them,'' Galliner wrote.
   ``But the Arab media, as a whole, remain shackled and
subservient to the political line of their respective
governments.''

   Uncle Sam's bathroom has been found.
   Archaeologists made the discovery on Ferry Street, site of the
house of 19th century meatpacker Sam Wilson, City Manager Stephen
Dworsky said. During the War of 1812, Wilson stamped his crates
``U.S.,'' leading to the military joke that the meat was provided
by ``Uncle Sam.''
   The archaeologists ``are down six feet, and you can literally
see what was the floor to the bathroom,'' Dworsky said.
   A park is being built on the site by Hannaford Bros., a
supermarket company based in Scarborough, Maine. The company is
building a store next to the park.
   Uncle Sam's house stood on the site from sometime in the 19th
century until 1971, when New York state demolished it to make way
for a road that was never built, Dworsky said. Hannaford bought the
site in 1988 for $277,000.
   When the park is finished, the house's foundation and bathroom
floor will on view to visitors, Dworsky said.

   Forget monthly payments and sky-high
list prices. About 40 bargain hunters camped out on a Westmoreland
County dealer's lot for a chance to buy cars for as little as $1.99.
   ``Obviously at $1.99 you don't make money. But the good will it
creates ... is fantastic,'' Les Dugan, general sales manager at
World Class Motors, said Monday.
   Tonya Stover of Apollo, her father and a friend occupied a 1979
Ford Pinto beginning around 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Their persistence
paid off when Stover bought the car Monday morning for $1.99.
   Raylene Pogoersckey of Arnold arrived at 3 p.m. Sunday but her
first choice, a 1980 Plymouth Volare for $69.99, was already spoken
for. She settled for a 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix priced at $499.99.
   Mike Madison of Plum got the Volare, which he said is probably
worth $1,000.
   ``You can't beat it,'' said Madison, a former used car salesman.
``Believe it or not, I have a Mercedes at home in the garage. This
is my winter ride.''
   Dugan said the prices ``return something to the community to
give people a chance to own a car.''
   The dealership offered 180 cars at prices ranging to $13,000.
Twenty-six were offered for less than $500. They carried no
warranties but Dugan said all of them were driven, not towed, onto
the lot.

   Portions of ``The Old Farmer's Almanac,'' the outdoor planter's
bible and an institution for 198 years, will be available on
videocassette next month, providing home remedies, gardening tips,
offbeat features and weather forecasts.
   The hour-long tape is narrated by Willard Scott of NBC's

remedies for toothaches and unconventional cures for the hiccups.
   There is also a look at how the almanac is put together.
   The program was produced by Brandwon Praxis Media Productions of
South Norwalk, using segments of some of the latest almanacs, said
Tim Clark, executive editor of the book, which is published by
Yankee Publishing Co. of Dublin, N.H.
   Clark was unsure of the financial arrangements between Braxis

Alaska and unavailable for comment.
   ``This is a video about the almanac, it's not the almanac,'' he

   The nation's welfare system is headed for a
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a
five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and
helping them collect more child support.
   The initiative agreed on Monday by Senate, House and White House
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace.
   The $3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the Senate's own
$2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial
$7.1 billion plan passed by the House.
   The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) program offering welfare parents _ including
those with preschool children _ services such as job search help,
education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would
be available to participants.

   Iben Browning holds dozens of patents
in several specialties, but it's his earthquake projections that
are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do without.
   Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a
high probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this
Dec. 2.
   He was deluged by calls.
   He insists he did not predict an earthquake.
   ``The public always wants everything in black and white,''
Browning said.
   ``No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec.
2, no one can know that. ... Everybody knows when he drives a car
that he's taking a risk that it will malfunction or crash. Yet
people do drive cars. They're dealing in probabilities.''
   Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the
public does not understand _ and the press does not know how to
communicate _ the idea of probability.
   ``The closest you can translate probability into English is
`maybe.' But unless you say `maybe not,' they take it as an
absolute,'' he said.
   Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an
Albuquerque biotechnology research and development company. His
Summa resume says he holds 66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics,
electronics, mechanics, chemistry, electro-optics, hydraulics and
educational toys.
   Summa credits him _ he won't discuss what he does for the
company _ with developing new technology for compressing
electronically transmitted human speech.
   Over the years, he's been a development physicist with American
Optical Co., worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a
scientist for Sandia National Laboratories.
   But gradually his interest in climatology grew, and he now
publishes the Browning Newslettter on world climate. He said he's
been accepted commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he
became a consultant for Paine Webber Inc.
   His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math
and physics from Southwest Texas State University, and a master's
degree in bacteriology physiology and a doctorate in physiology,
genetics and bacteriology from the University of Texas at Austin.
   ``It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of
the soft tools with which I approached biology were applicable to
climate,'' he said. ``It's a subject that is comparable in
complexity to biology.''
   Business needs climate information because the weather
determines how much food will be produced and where, whether the
transportation industry can get over the roads, whether anything
can be built, he said.
   He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain
Almanac and ``did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac
predictions,'' said Lee Olson, almanac editor.
   ``He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in
late August, that the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra
moisture and store up adequate moisture for the 1990 year,'' Olson
said. ``He had the ski season only partly. He had it right for an
early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall and his
timing was a little off on that.''
   Browning said his climatological observations are based on high
tidal forces, produced by four causes: the proximity of the moon to
Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; the alignment of the
Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and the more
perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. The vector sum
would be the total tidal force produced.
   Such forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2,
there will be the highest vector sum high tidal force in 60 years
from 30 to 60 degrees north latitude. That area includes the New
Madrid Fault, running roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New
Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.
   Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a
December New Madrid quake, the Arkansas National Guard has
scheduled earthquake exercises for around that time, one Arkansas
school district is considering canceling classes and sales of
earthquake insurance have picked up.
   But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered
would depend on the pressure built up along it. That information
should come from area seismologists, he said firmly.
   If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said
people will be more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid
Fault.
   ``That's what I fear more than anything else,'' he said.
``People don't trust authorities anymore; they never did trust them
much. Why should they? What have authorities done for them except
tax them to death?''
   Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among
seismologists.
   Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.,
said correlating earthquakes to tidal forces doesn't work.
   ``It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll
have something (quake activity), rather than on this particular
day,'' Jacob said. ``You see, earthquakes don't care about
predictions. And people shouldn't worry about predictions. They
should worry about earthquakes.''
   Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers
in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of
an earthquake registering 7 on the Richter scale on or about Oct.
16 because a high triggering force was expected that date and
geologists had determined there was a strain on the San Andreas
Fault.
   An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people.
   Jacob said: ``He was just lucky. That's the law of large
numbers.''
   Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research
and Information at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said
Browning ``is certainly not justified scientifically.''
   ``The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been
examined thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that
tidal forces can trigger earthquakes. ... Earthquakes depend on the
internal processes of the Earth, not the external processes of the
sun and moon.''

   Punxsutawney Phil, the country's No. 1
four-footed forecaster, squinted hard but failed to see his shadow
Friday, thus predicting an early spring for only the 10th time in
more than a century.
   The squirming, 10-pound groundhog was pulled from his manmade
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at 7:27 a.m. The crowd of about 1,500
screamed wildly after Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said Edwin Snyder, 64, a county judge and a
member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle.
   ``He turned to Groundhog Club President Jim Means and signaled
to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow today,'''
Snyder said.
   Virtually everyone in the crowd of mostly students, some of whom
had waited in the light rain and mud for hours, seemed stunned by
the woodchuck's prediction. Even the tuxedo-clad members of the
Inner Circle, who decide well in advance what Phil predicts every
Groundhog Day, professed astonishment.
   ``I think he made a good pick,'' said Means, 66, who held Phil
to his ear then informed Snyder of the forecast so the judge could
announce it.
   John Groninger, 24, a college student from Fairbanks, Alaska,
who's traveling around the country, was thrilled with Phil's
prediction even though he doubts it will apply back home.
   ``It will be six more weeks of winter no matter what Phil
says,'' Groninger said, grinning.
   Tradition has it that if a groundhog sees his shadow at sunrise
on Feb. 2, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't,
spring is just around the corner.
   Phil has predicted an early spring just nine other times since
1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in this
small western Pennsylvania town. The favorable forecasts were in
1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
feast celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to the
temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   As soon as his forecast was announced, Phil was whisked away
from the burrow and returned to his rest-of-the-year home at the
local library, a heated and air-conditioned hutch that he shares
with two other groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   Other prognosticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead.
   Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central Pennsylvania's
Quarryville. Neither did West Virginia's Concord Charlie as he was
``wandering around campus to see if any flowers are up,'' said Tom
Bone, public information director for Concord College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   Buckeye Chuck, Ohio's official groundhog, also failed to see his
shadow when he emerged from his burrow in a wooded lot next to the
studios of radio station WMRN in Marion.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.
   Phil's forecast isn't too far off the National Weather Service's
prediction for the next few months. Meteorologists expect February
to be warmer than usual in western Pennsylvania but colder than
usual in March and April.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, on the other hand, is predicting an
extremely cold and snowy February around Punxsutawney.

Iben Browning holds dozens of patents in several specialties, but it's his 
earthquake projections that are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a high 
probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He was deluged by calls. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he did not predict an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The public always wants everything in black and white," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec. 2, no one can 
know that. . . . Everybody knows when he drives a car that he's taking a risk 
that it will malfunction or crash. Yet people do drive cars. They're dealing in 
probabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the public does not 
understand -- and the press does not know how to communicate -- the idea of 
probability. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest you can translate probability into English is 'maybe.' But unless 
you say 'maybe not,' they take it as an absolute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, who publishes the Browning Newsletter on world climate, said his 
climatological observations are based on high tidal forces produced by four 
causes: the proximity of the moon to Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; 
the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and 
the more perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. These factors 
combine to produce tidal forces. 
</P>
<P>
The same forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2, there will be 
the highest combination of such factors in 60 years from 30 degrees to 60 
degrees north latitude. That area includes the New Madrid Fault, running 
roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a December New Madrid 
quake, the Arkansas National Guard has scheduled earthquake exercises for 
around that time, one Arkansas school district is considering canceling classes 
and sales of earthquake insurance have picked up. 
</P>
<P>
But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered would depend on 
the pressure built up along it. That information should come from area 
seismologists, he said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said people will be 
more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I fear more than anything else," he said. "People don't trust 
authorities anymore; they never did trust them much. Why should they? What have 
authorities done for them except tax them to death?" 
</P>
<P>
Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory 
of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., said correlating earthquakes to 
tidal forces doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll have something 
(quake activity), rather than on this particular day," Jacob said. "You see, 
earthquakes don't care about predictions. And people shouldn't worry about 
predictions. They should worry about earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers in San Francisco 
on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake registering 7 
on the Richter scale on or about Oct. 16 because a high triggering force was 
expected that date and geologists had determined there was a strain on the San 
Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob said: "He was just lucky. That's the law of large numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information 
at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said Browning "is certainly not 
justified scientifically." 
</P>
<P>
"The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been examined 
thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that tidal forces can 
trigger earthquakes. . . . Earthquakes depend on the internal processes of the 
Earth, not the external processes of the sun and moon." 
</P>
<P>
Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an Albuquerque 
biotechnology research and development company. His Summa resume says he holds 
66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics, electronics, mechanics, chemistry, 
electrooptics, hydraulics and educational toys. 
</P>
<P>
Summa credits him -- he won't discuss what he does for the company -- with 
developing new technology for compressing electronically transmitted human 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he has been a development physicist with American Optical Co., 
worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a scientist for Sandia 
National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually his interest in climatology grew. He said he has been accepted 
commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he became a consultant for 
Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math and physics from 
Southwest Texas State University, and a master's degree in bacteriology 
physiology and a doctorate in physiology, genetics and bacteriology from the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of the soft tools 
with which I approached biology were applicable to climate," he said. "It's a 
subject that is comparable in complexity to biology." 
</P>
<P>
Business needs climate information because the weather determines how much food 
will be produced and where, whether the transportation industry can get over 
the roads, whether anything can be built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain Almanac and 
"did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac predictions," said Lee 
Olson, almanac editor. 
</P>
<P>
"He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in late August, that 
the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra moisture and store up adequate 
moisture for the 1990 year," Olson said. "He had the ski season only partly. He 
had it right for an early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall 
and his timing was a little off on that."

<TEXT>
   Hurt by slumping sales, Yankee Publishing
Inc., publisher of the Old Farmer's Almanac, plans to lay off a
third of its employees and sell a book division and New England
Business magazine.
   Last year, the 54-year-old company sold two magazines, Texas
Business and ASTA Agency Management.
   President Joseph Meagher said sales dropped from $50 million in
1987 to $40 million last year, but he declined to disclose profit
and loss figures.
   ``It was not a good year,'' Meagher told the Keene Sentinel, but
he added that the company is financially healthy. He said he
expected finances to improve once the company consolidates.
   Besides publishing the Old Farmer's Almanac, with a circulation
of 3 million nationwide, the company publishes Yankee magazine,
which sells 1 million copies each month; Yankee Travel, with an
annual circulation of 200,000; Yankee Homes, 35,000 monthly
circulation, and Alaska, 235,000 monthly circulation.
   Meagher said New England Business, with a free circulation of
90,000 monthly, is a ``break-even'' publication. The book division,
which puts out six mostly non-fiction books a year on topics such
as cooking and photography, is profitable, Meagher said, but the
company wants to focus on regional magazines.
   Starting April 1, 68 employees who handled Yankee subscriptions
will be laid off and the work handled by a subcontractor, and on
July 1, the 16-person graphics department will be closed and the
work done by outside companies at less cost, Meagher said.

<HEAD>Punxsutawney Phil, Other Weather Lore Not All Hogwash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doubters beware. Like other weather
lore, Punxsutawney Phil, America's best-known and best-kept
woodchuck, isn't entirely hogwash, according to folklorists.
   ``A great many folk beliefs have a certain logic behind them. It
may not be scientifically verifiable, but they're often not
completely random and I think this is one of them,'' said Erika
Brady, assistant professor in programs in folk studies at Western
Kentucky University.
   ``We're always kind of taking a look at folk wisdom to see if
there is some basis in fact for it,'' agreed Tim Clark, executive
editor of The Old Farmer's Almanac. ``The lasting lesson is not to
underestimate our ancestors. They were not dumb people.''
   Barring calamity, at sunrise Friday, fat, furry Punxsutawney
Phil will be pulled from a manmade burrow atop Gobbler's Knob,
about a mile outside town.
   If the critter sees his shadow, tradition has it there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly
around the corner.
   ``If you're a groundhog or a person and you come out of your
warm, snug haven that you've made for the winter and get fooled by
the sunlight into thinking it's spring, you're going to be in
trouble,'' Clark said. ``So it says the groundhog is not fooled.
   ``I think it's no coincidence the spring equinox comes about six
weeks after Groundhog Day.''
   The legend actually has roots in Christianity. Groundhog Day
falls on Feb. 2, also the Christian holiday of Candlemas, when the
infant Jesus first was taken to the temple. An old Scottish couplet
claims: ``If Candlemas be fair, there'll be two winters in the
year.''
   Punxsutawney's German-born farmers borrowed the legend and on
Feb. 2, 1887, began turning to local woodchucks for a clue to the
upcoming weather.
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club heralds Phil as the seer of
seers, sage of sages, weather prophet extraordinare. Phil has
predicted an early spring a scant nine times over the past century.
The last time was in 1988.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Jim Means, 66, the club's
president and member of the group's exclusive Inner Circle.
   Actually, the 14 local businessmen in the Inner Circle decide
the forecast well in advance. The group even holds rehearsals
before Groundhog Day, when members don top hats and tails and join
about 1,500 people gathered in the dark atop Gobbler's Knob.
   And every day except Groundhog Day, Phil lives in town in a
heated, air-conditioned hutch at the library with two other
groundhogs, known to some as Philomena and Barney.

<HEAD>Shellshocked Farmers Fear Another Dry Year Amid Winter Of Discontent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Farmers shellshocked by the 1988 drought are worrying anew
whether the unusually warm winter will break, sending them the
precipitation they need for next year's crops.
   ``There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense
it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural
products,'' said Joe Summer, a corn and soybean farmer in McLean
County in central Illinois.
   Parts of the county have received 25 inches less rain than
average in 22 months. For the first time in 45 years of farming,
Summer is taking out multiperil insurance on next season's crop.
   The warm, dry winter had something to do with that decision, he
said Thursday, but so did bad crops in six of the last eight years
in what used to be the nation's top corn-producing county.
   ``We're all beginning to get a little paranoid about it,'' the
62-year-old farmer said. ``There is no frost in the ground. This
unusually warm weather is strange. It is a harbinger of some sort, I
think.''
   According to the National Weather Service, severe to extreme
drought conditions continue in much of the northern Great Plains,
northern Rockies and parts of the Midwest.
   The weather service's most recent precipitation map shows extreme
drought in Montana, the Dakotas, central Minnesota, eastern Iowa,
northwestern Illinois and much of Wyoming, eastern Idaho, central
Washington and eastern Oregon, said meteorologist Dave Miskus of the
Climate Analysis Center in Washington, D.C.
   However, the most recent 30-day forecast calls for above-normal
precipitation, said meteorologist Edward O'Lenic, also of the
Climate Analysis Center.
   The northern Great Plains and northern Rockies need as much as 8
inches above normal rainfall to end the drought, while Iowa and
Illinois need 8 to 9 inches more than normal, Miskus said.
   The weather service will not release its spring forecast until
after the commodities markets close Monday, but O'Lenic said there
is no reason to expect more of the drought that hit the nation last
summer.
   Even so, farmers and Farm Bureau officials are worried.
   ``At this stage, we're hoping for a terribly wet spring,'' said
Minnesota Farm Bureau administrator Gerald Hagaman. ``There's
apprehension.''
   Farm Bureau officials in Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Iowa say much the same thing.
   ``Our moisture levels are still down. We don't have adequate
moisture in the soil and we could have a problem if we don't have
above-average rainfall this spring,'' said Don Henderson, vice
president of the Indiana Farm Bureau.
   Indiana farmers are also worried about the mild temperatures,
which have averaged a relatively balmy 34.1 degrees this month. Such
weather ``doesn't kill a lot of the pests,'' Henderson said.
``That's a major problem to us.''
   In Wisconsin, ``the real question for farmers is how much snow
we'll get,'' said state Farm Bureau President Don Haldeman. ``We
came off the driest year we've ever had, and they're wondering if
we'll have another year of drought.''
   ``It's a major topic of discussion when farmers get together,''
agreed Jerry Snethen of the Farm Bureau in Iowa, which saw some of
the worst of the 1988 drought.
   Spring rains will moisten the top inches, but farmers have lost
deep soil moisture, their one insurance against drought, said Dennis
Vercler of the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   ``It sets up a scenario similar to 1988,'' he said.``This is
concerning a lot of people, even though it is fairly early. They're
edgy about it. We're going into the season needing just the right
rain at just the right time.''
   Farmers aren't the only ones affected by the winter of discontent.
   In Milwaukee, springlike temperatures and below-average snowfall
forced Icebreaker Winter Funfest organizers to move ice-sculpting
events inside a refrigerated ice house. The U.S. International Snow
Sculpting Competition, a major festival event, was saved only
because huge blocks of snow from a storm last month had been saved.
   In New England, the lack of precipitation forced ski resorts to
use machine-made snow until storms in the past couple weeks, and has
Boston officials concerned there may be a water shortage this
summer. The warm, dry weather has also cut heating and municipal
snow-removal costs.
   Maine had more familiar weather Thursday, when a driving
snowstorm dumped up to 6 inches of snow on the state, closing
schools and delaying flights.
   ``It's been an abnormal winter,'' said George Wiseman of the
weather service's Portland, Maine, office. ``This is closer to
normal.''

   An unusually warm and dry winter is worrying farmers from
Illinois to Michigan who fear a repeat of the 1988 drought.
   ``There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense
it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural
products,'' said Joe Summer, a McLean County corn and soybean farmer
in central Illinois.
   For the first time in 45 years of farming, Summer is taking out
multi-peril insurance on next season's crop.
   ``We're all beginning to get a little paranoid about it,'' the
62-year-old farmer said. ``There is no frost in the ground. This

   Forecasters for the National Weather Service say severe to
extreme drought conditions continue in much of the northern Great
Plains, northern Rockies and parts of the Midwest.
   But the most recent 30-day forecast calls for above-normal
precipitation, said meteorologist Edward O'Lenic with the service's
climate analysis offices in Washington, D.C.
   The agency will not release its spring forecast until after the
commodities markets close Monday, but O'Lenic said there is no
reason to expect more of the drought that hit much of the nation
last summer.
   Even so, farmers and their farm bureaus are worried.
   ``If we don't get some snowfall, we could go into the spring
lacking the snowmelt,'' said Michigan Farm Bureau spokesman Al Almy.
``Potentially, we could be on the short side.''
   Farm bureau officials in Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Iowa say the same.
   ``At this stage, we're hoping for a terribly wet spring,'' said
Gerald Hagaman, administrator of the Minnesota Farm Bureau.
``There's apprehension.''
   Spring rains will quench the top soil, but farmers have lost deep
soil moisture, their one insurance against drought, said Dennis
Vercler with the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   ``They're edgy about it. We're going into the season needing just
the right rain at just the right time,'' Vercler said.
   Lack of precipitation is not the only worry.
   ``If we stay relatively mild, the real problem is that it doesn't
kill a lot of the pests,'' said Don Henderson, vice president of the
Indiana Farm Bureau, where January temperatures have averaged 34.1
degrees.
   Sheets of ice have coated snowless fields in Wisconsin and
southern Michigan off and on for the past three weeks, causing a
different danger for winter crops of wheat and alfalfa _ icing.
   ``If part of an alfalfa field is coated with ice, it can smother
the plants to death,'' said Wisconsin Farm Bureau President Don
Haldeman.
   Cycles of freezing and thawing also have set up a heaving and
uprooting problem for winter wheat, Almy said in Michigan. ``And if
it should suddenly turn cold, the lack of snow cover could expose
the plants,'' he said.
   The one bright spot is that mild weather is making the winter
easier on livestock, farming officials said.
   The National Weather Service's most recent precipitation map
shows extreme drought in Montana, the Dakotas, central Minnesota,
eastern Iowa, northwestern Illinois and much of Wyoming, eastern
Idaho, central Washington and eastern Oregon, said meteorologist
Dave Miskus from the Climate Analysis Center.
   ``It sure does cause concern,'' said Enid Schlipf, another McLean
County farmer in Illinois. ``We don't understand what's happening.''

<HL> And in Early February, They Get
An Update From Mr. Groundhog

By Rick Wartzman
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> CNG
NATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) </IN>
<TEXT>
   For the past five years, through milder-than-usual winters across much of the U.S., natural-gas companies have been pining for frigid weather to boost profits. 
A few have been more literal about it than others. 

   At Consolidated Natural Gas Co., for instance, officials use fallen pine cones to help forecast the nation's winter weather -- and the company's first-quarter earnings. 

   Each year about this time, a report arrives from Maryland's Eastern Shore at Consolidated's Pittsburgh headquarters. 
Compiled by a retired lawyer interested in energy matters, the report tells directors how many pine cones have hit the ground and how big they are. 
The theory is: The more cones that have dropped and the hardier they are, the colder the winter is likely to be. 

   This fall's report, in a departure from recent years, says the cones in Maryland are huge and plentiful. 
And the prospect of it being very cold outside is making Consolidated officials feel all warm inside. 
"We're actually accused of being sadistic about this," says Ray Ernest, a vice president. 
"Really we're not." 

   It's just that chilling temperatures are the lifeblood of any gas and pipeline firm. 
Consolidated says its first-half 1987 earnings were $11.1 million lower than they would have been if temperatures during the period had been normal. 
Instead, they were 8.4% warmer than the National Weather Service's 20-year average. 

   The cone report isn't Consolidated's only way of predicting a winter's weather. 
Some executives keep handy the latest edition of the Farmer's Almanac. 
And a spokesman says he's encouraged because woolly-bear caterpillars are sporting especially thick coats this year. 

   Other firms have been known to count acorns, but some people dismiss all such methods. 
"It's old jokes and wives' tales," says Nick Ruvo, general superintendent for Brooklyn Union Gas Co. 
"I don't know if anyone puts wholehearted faith in it." 

   Consolidated spokesmen temper their pine-cone and caterpillar predictions by noting that the company also looks at data from certified meteorologists and respected agencies, including the National Weather Service. 

   When all is said and done, however, company officials leave little doubt as to which harbinger they favor. 
Before the winter of 1976-77, when blizzards and cold waves hit much of the nation, "the pine cones were enormous," Mr. Ernest says. 
"And they're looking real big now."

   Romance, clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby
tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989, but it will be a
ho-hum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids, according to
The American Forecaster 1989.
   Other '89 trends identified by the Forecaster: gutterless
bowling alleys, fighting dogs on steroids and turkey hunting.
   New Age religion channeling will become passe in 1989, along
with teddy bears and soft cookies, said Kim Long, author of the
sixth annual 192-page Forecaster, which went on sale this week.
   Long said 1989 could be a boring year trend-wise.
   The problem, he said, is that baby boomers _ the one-third of
the U.S. population born between the years 1946 and 1964 _ are
concentrating on their careers and families, and college students
have grown serious.
   The rise of romance and a growing de-emphasis on sex in
advertising, movies and television are directly linked to the aging
baby boomers, Long said.
   ``More of them are having their first kids, and that tends to
slow you down and keep you close to home,'' he said.
   Long was surprised by the growing popularity of lullaby tapes
for the babies of baby-boomer moms. ``Baby boomer mothers who don't
have time or don't know how to sing lullabies are buying tapes from
the professionals,'' he said.
   Clothing styles are becoming conservative and utilitarian, Long
said. ``There is nothing in men's or women's fashions that is a
jump ahead _ pretty boring,'' he said.
   In men's footwear, this means the return of big shoes _
expensive, leather wingtips and brogues. ``The big shoe thing has
been building slowly and is part of the gradual return to
traditional clothing,'' Long said.
   Long, a Denver free-lance writer, has been writing The American
Forecaster since 1983. His predictions have gained such
respectability that the Old Farmer's Almanac gave Long space in the
1988 and 1989 editions.
   Long said the New Age practice of channeling, popularized by
actress Shirley MacLain, will fade in 1989 because of skepticism
and ridicule.
   But astrology will remain hot in 1989, Long said, mainly because
of President and Nancy Reagan's reliance on astrological
interpretations and the subsequent efforts by astrologers to
legitimize the practice as a science.
   Out-of-shape youngsters will be put in fitness programs as the
preoccupation with health trickles down from adults to their
offspring, Long predicted.
   Some curiosities among the trends that will take hold in 1989:
steroid use to make fighting dogs meaner and stronger, gutterless
bowling alleys and a surge in turkey hunting, which Long said was
becoming popular because the birds are tough to shoot.
   Gutterless bowling alleys are for novices and the hopelessly
uncoordinated, Long said. Inflatable tubes are placed in the
gutters between the lanes.
   Long said in an interview last week that of his 1988 forecasts,
he is proudest of his prediction that girdle sales would increase
and of his identification of biodegradable plastics as an important
development.
   On the down side, he was off the mark in predicting the end of
the TV shows ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty'' and in saying that Pee Wee
Herman would go prime time.
   Long wrote in the '89 Forecaster that Michael Dukakis will be
the next president, but last week he hedged. ``According to every
single indicator from the common to the bizarre, it's too close to
call.''

<TEXT>
   If you've got a big brain, a yen for the indoors
and little love of glamour or rawboned rigor, then America has just
the right job for you, according to the publishers of ``The Jobs
Rated Almanac.''
   Ranked as the best of 250 American jobs is a career few children
are likely to have heard of, much less name: an actuary. Next are
computer programmer, computer systems analyst, mathematician and
statistician.
   Typical, more glamorous children's career choices like being a
dancer, doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanac's
overall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in at
least one of the six ranking criteria.
   According to the almanac, published this month by American
References Inc. of Chicago, the worst job listed in the ranking was
migrant worker, which rated near or at the bottom in all six of the
criteria.
   The second worst _ commercial fishing _ also was ranked low
because of long hours, seasonal work, high government regulation
and tough physical demands. That was followed by construction
worker, roofer, seaman, dairy farmer, roustabout, lumberjack,
cowboy and professional football player.
   Almanac Editor and Publisher Les Krantz identified the criteria
used to judge jobs as salary, stress, work environment, outlook,
security and physical demands.
   ``Most of the best paying jobs are performed in highly
competitive and physically confining environments for long hours,''
Krantz said. ``Don't expect a cushy job if you want to earn more
than $50,000 a year.''
   But ultimately, he added, ``The job best for an individual is
the one the person likes the best, and that depends a lot on
someone's priorities.''
   Astronauts have the worst working environment, with surgeons
second, the book concluded. Firefighters have the longest work
weeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physically
demanding, it said.
   But actuaries _ who interpret statistics to determine expected
personal losses due to sickness or disability and material losses
from disasters _ did well in all six categories.
   A 23-year old actuary in training, Mike Vaughan, said he agreed
with the assessment.
   ``Once the (training) exams are over, I'd say the stress would
be pretty much non-existent, and the job market is so open I could
just walk out and find a new job in a day,'' he said.
   Vaughan, who works for Allstate Insurance Co. in suburban
Northbrook, said his $31,000 annual salary ``was probably 20 to 25
percent higher than any other job I could have gotten, and it goes
up faster.''
   William Hermes, a fisherman for 47 years, said he wasn't
bothered by his job's low ranking and couldn't imagine making a
living any other way.
   ``It's the only job I've ever wanted,'' said Hermes, 62, owner
of Big Bay DeNoc Fisheries in Garden, Mich. ``You're out in the
open, you're your own boss and you don't have to answer to nobody.''
   Krantz said most of the information for the almanac comes from
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce and
the Census Bureau, but tracking down some statistics, like a
cowboy's wages, took some legwork.
   ``We literally called cattle ranches and they told us: `Well, if
you have a good horse you can make about $150 a week,'' he said.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration's chief
administrative law judge says marijuana should be legalized as a
prescription drug because smoking it helps cancer patients control
nausea after chemotherapy.
   Francis L. Young recommended reclassifying marijuana as a
Schedule II drug so that it could be prescribed by physicians to
treat the often severe nausea accompanying chemotherapy as well as
muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis.
   Young, whose findings are not binding on DEA's head, John Lawn,
acknowledged that ``strong emotions are aroused on both sides of
any discussion concerning the use of marijuana.''

American atomic attack on ``principal North Korean cities'' if the
invading communist forces did not withdraw from South Korea.
   Bentsen, now the Democratic vice presidential candidate but then

advocate use of nuclear weapons in Korea. Others were to speak out
in agreement, but neither President Truman nor, later, President
Eisenhower ever voiced their support.
   In an interview Thursday, Bentsen said he is ``older and wiser''
now and would not do the same again.

   The Farmers' Almanac expects to see a
little less snow and a lot less drought next year, but what the
172-year-old digest of Americana really wants to see less of is
pennies.
   The penny, inspiration for homely expressions that have been a
staple of almanacs since Benjamin Franklin set up shop _ ``A penny
saved is a penny earned'' is one _ has outlived its usefulness,
concludes the 1989 edition of the Farmer's Almanac.
   ``Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny.
But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,'' the almanac says, living
down its reputation as a defender of long-held values.

      How Is a Price Set
   For Pearls of Wisdom? 

   ONE MOTIVE often cited for Paul A. Volcker's resignation last year as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was money: He wanted to make more -- or so pundits said. 

   Without a doubt, he is making lots more. 
It isn't known what he pulls in as chairman and partner of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., the investment-banking firm. 
But it is reliably reported that he was recently offered a fee of $150,000 for a single speech and turned the money down for another, possibly more lucrative, arrangement. 

   As Fed chairman, Mr. Volcker made $89,500 a year. 

   The speech will be delivered Oct. 13 at the official opening of Olympia &amp; York's World Financial Center in lower Manhattan. 
According to people with knowledge of the negotiations, Olympia &amp; York approached Messrs. 
Wolfensohn and Volcker about Mr. Volcker speaking at the opening, and a fee of $150,000 was originally discussed. 
But finally, these people say, it was decided among the parties concerned that Mr. Volcker's compensation would be future investment-banking business for James D. Wolfensohn Inc. from Olympia &amp; York. 

   Mr. Volcker acknowledges that he will speak on Oct. 13. 
Asked about the $150,000, he laughs and says, "I know nothing about that. 
That's gossip." 
An Olympia &amp; York spokesman, when asked about the same thing, says, "It's just gossip and rumor." 

   When asked about possible Olympia &amp; York investment-banking business for Wolfensohn, Mr. Volcker says: "We always would like to build relationships with good-quality customers." 

   The Weather Prediction
   Was Very, Very Hazy
   THE FOURTH of July forecast by the National Weather Service called for rainfall in the parched Midwest over the next six to 10 days. 

   During this summer's drought, any hint of significant rain has sparked a drop in farm futures prices. 
So on July 5, when Chicago commodity traders returned from their holiday weekend, farm-futures prices plummeted. 

   Meantime, many private forecasters were predicting dry weather. 
Charles Notis, of Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa, said on July 5, "Based on everything we've seen, the {National Weather Service} pattern just doesn't make sense." 

   Word of the discrepancy soon reached the Chicago Board of Trade, where a rumor began that the weather service's forecast must have been issued by a junior meteorologist filling in for a superior over the holiday. 
But prices still stayed lower for the day. 

   Says a National Weather Service spokesman: "Whoever issued the forecast was a competent meteorologist." 
Still, on July 6, the weather service issued a revised forecast calling for more dry weather in much of the Midwest. 

   Says the weather service's spokesman: "These {forecasts} aren't supposed to be gospel." 

   It Might Have Spelled
   The End of Cocoa Beach
   THE FOUNDER of Gannett Co.'s Florida Today, Allen Neuharth, recently became a guest columnist in his Florida paper. 
His topic: "Middle-of-the-night police visits amount to harassment of citizens." 

   The column was a letter sent by Mr. Neuharth on May 29 to Bob Lawton, the mayor of Cocoa Beach, Fla. 
"I am a longtime law-abiding citizen of Cocoa Beach, a heavy taxpayer and a generous supporter of public interest projects and of public employees," he wrote. 
"I am writing to object to harassment caused me at 12:30 a.m. today by the Cocoa Beach Police Department. 

   "The police dispatcher awakened me at that time with a telephone call," Mr. Neuharth wrote; the call was to request that he admit a police officer and two officers of the Sea Turtle Society to the grounds of his residence. 
He acceded, he wrote; the trio arrived; and he was told they were there because "your lights are in violation of the Cocoa Beach code concerning sea turtles." 

   Mr. Neuharth took exception. 
"The sea turtle spokesman then . . . insisted I was a lawbreaker," he wrote. 
"The police officer sided with him." 
Then they left. 

   "I have literally helped put Cocoa Beach on the map," Mr. Neuharth wrote. 
"It would sadden me if I should now have to report that this is where the police work with self-appointed and self-anointed special interest people . . . to summon peaceful people like me from their sleep." 

   Replied the mayor in a letter: "Following lengthy review of this matter, the City Manager and Police Chief have issued clear instructions that should prevent any recurrence of the type of action to which you were subjected." 

   The town stays on the map. 

   Odds and Ends -
   TALL STORY: In a newsletter published by New York University's business school, John Phillips writes about his stint as a Colgate-Palmolive Co. intern. 
A big event was when he met Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman, president and chief executive officer, whom Mr. Phillips describes as having "a commanding presence that belied his short stature." 
Mr. Phillips continues: "'You know, John,' the bald CEO remarked as he glanced at my 6-foot-plus frame topped by a thick head of hair, 'career opportunities at Colgate are very limited for someone who is tall and has a lot of hair.'" 
Still, Colgate hired Mr. Phillips as an assistant product manager, and the newsletter shows a photo of Mr. Phillips and Mr. Mark; the CEO, towering over his new employee, is standing on a desk. . . . 
Spelling lessons not included: "Two exciting days that may change the way you look at business computing forever," trumpeted the ad in the Los Angeles Times. 
"Attend the Apple Business Forum and find out what a Macintosh can do for you." 
Illustrating the ad was a desk calendar open to "Wenesday," June 29, 1988.

   Cattle farmers are sending cows to
slaughter and mowing roadside ditches to feed remaining animals
trying to survive one of the region's worst droughts since the Dust
Bowl. Crop farmers, meanwhile, can only wait.
   ``Everybody is culling every cow that they don't need. You're
seeing a lot of older cows going to market,'' said Malcolm
McGregor, a Nashua farmer and regional vice president of the
National Cattlemen's Association.
   In northeast Iowa on Wednesday, Vernon Kuhn worked in his
withering fields, which yielded 50 bushels of soybeans per acre
last year.
   ``If we get 35 an acre, we'll be tickled to death,'' he said.
``We need a week of rain.''
   Elsewhere in the nation's midsection and Southeast, farmers
turned to sometimes desperate measures to help relieve the drought
that's prompted widespread water conservation and threatened farm
yields, sending prices zooming on commodity exchanges.
   ``We get a daily report (on the drought) each day and I must say
most days since early May anyway those reports have not been
good,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said today on CBS-TV's
``This Morning.''
   Asked if the situation was developing into a potential disaster,
Lyng replied: ``Emphasizing the word potential, yes, that's
correct. The major corn belt area, this is the most reliable
farming area in the world ... is threatened. It's a serious
matter.''
   Speaking on the same program, the American Farm Bureau's Terry
Francl said: ``We are reaching a critical phase over the next week.
If we do not have rain, that means there'll be substantial
reductions in yields.''
   But weather forecasters continued to bear bleak news after a dry
winter followed by a parched spring.
   ``It's going to be dry across the Plains and the upper Midwest
at least the next couple of days,'' Hugh Crowther, of the National
Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo., said today.
   In Clyde, Ohio, florist Cliff Doebel spurned traditional
forecasting science and invited Leonard Crow Dog, a Sioux medicine
man from South Dakota, to perform an Indian rain ritual.
   ``Crow Dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four
winds of the Earth to bring the rain to Sandusky County,'' Doebel
said.
   Water levels on the Mississippi reached record lows, meanwhile,
stranding at least 750 barges. Twice that many could become mired
by the weekend, equaling ``a traffic jam of semi-trucks bumper to
bumper from New Orleans to Philadelphia (Pa.),'' said Michael
Logue, spokesman for the Vicksburg District of the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Despite predictions of scattered showers and thunderstorms
today, forecasters see no significant relief for Iowa and the rest
of the Corn Belt.
   The area from Missouri to Ohio should get below-normal rain in
the next month, while dry conditions should ease with above-normal
rains in the South and southern Plains states, according to a
forecast by the weather service and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   On Wednesday, prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn and
oats rocketed to their daily trading limits within seconds of the
opening bell at the Chicago Board of Trade, a reflection of Lyng's
gloomy assessment the day before.
   Lyng, calling the drought a potential national disaster, said
damage already had been done to wheat fields in Montana and the
Dakotas and that additional dry weeks of scorching temperatures
could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across the South.
   ``If you got hay to sell, you can get whatever (price) you can
ask. ... There just isn't any,'' said Al Luetmer, a Minnesota dairy
and grain farmer.
   McGregor, who recently attended a cattlemen's meeting in Denver
on the drought, said farmers in North Dakota and eastern Montana
have been forced to sell productive livestock to meatpackers
because of parched pastures and rising feed prices.
   Iowa's not far behind, he said. Meanwhile, cattlemen here are
trimming their herds.
   ``I don't see any liquidation yet, but it will be soon if we
don't get any rain,'' he said. ``There's certainly nothing growing
up here.''
   The USDA has allowed farmers in 96 of Iowa's 99 counties to feed
cattle on land originally left out of row crop production under the
federal set-aside program. A similar measure was taken in Missouri.
   ``The decision to allow haying and grazing on diverted acres was
a lifesaver for us,'' said Dorothy Tisdale, who has a herd of 70
beef cows on the farm she operates with her husband, Fred, near
Milton.
   Gov. Terry Branstad this week ordered the Iowa Department of
Transportation to allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near
their property and feed the hay to livestock.
   Farmers of row crops like corn and soybeans, meanwhile, are
still holding out for rain to salvage 1988 yields, despite one of
the worst droughts since the 1930s' Dust Bowl.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, who played ``Gopher'' in TV's ``The
Love Boat,'' toured farms in his northwest Iowa district last
weekend.
   ``I saw stressed corn,'' he said Wednesday. ``The farmers
weren't quite concerned yet, but everyone said 10 days could make a
difference between having a serious condition and a critical
condition.''

   He was a lawyer, investment banker, professor and
editor _ and only 32 when the plane he was in crashed in the
mountains of Ethiopia.
   But friends remember Ivan Tillem as a selfless man who overcame a
poor, troubled childhood to use his wealth to help others,
especially the young _ from disadvantaged children in Brooklyn to
starving children in Africa.
   ``When everyone else was talking, he was out there doing,'' said
Neal Schnall, his roommate on a 1986 trip to Ethiopia.
   Tillem was on the plane that crashed Aug. 7 in southwestern
Ethiopia, killing 16, including U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas.
Tillem, an Orthodox Jew, had worked on behalf of Ethiopians, Jewish
and otherwise, since 1986, helping establish a poultry-farming
enterprise.
   ``You can't save the world, but you can save one corner of it _
and in Ivan's case, several corners,'' said Barbara Ribakove Gordon,
executive director of the North American Conference on Ethiopian
Jews.
   ``It was very typical of him, that helping Ethiopia meant not
just sitting in New York and writing checks, but going there, going
to visit Jewish villages, putting drops in children's eyes.''
   Tillem's resume looked like that of someone twice his age:
chairman of the Pacific Financial Corp.; professor at Stern College
at Yeshiva University, where he was on the board of trustees;
publisher and editor of the Jewish Almanac, which he subsidized to
keep it affordable.
   ``It's hard to believe that one guy could do all these things,''
Schnall said. ``He used to say, `I don't have time to sleep. I've
got things I've got to do.' ''
   Among those things were establishing a scholarship fund for poor
students at Yeshiva University, and a fund for retarded and
disadvantaged children at Ohel Children's Home in Brooklyn.
   ``He had almost an obsession to make a difference,'' said
longtime friend Dennis Rapps, executive director of the National
Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs, where Tillem once
practiced civil rights law.
   As Tillem wrote in his preface to the Jewish Almanac, ``hunger,
despair, homelessness, blindness, deprivation, enslavement and
hopelessness'' exist alongside ``tranquility, order and privilege,''
and Jews should work to improve the ratio.
   ``That is `tikkun hoalam' _ repairing the world, for the world
can and should be different than it is,'' he wrote.
   ``He listened to what others had to say and spoke quietly,'' said
Karen Bacon, dean of Stern College for Women. ``But he was so
imaginative in his ideas.
   ``And all of them were directed toward solving problems of
humanity _ social problems, political problems. He had ideas for the

   ``He gave away most of his money,'' said Abe Bayer, director for
international affairs for the National Jewish Community Relations
Advisory Council.
   Tillem seldom spoke of his childhood, friends said, though it was
known his parents divorced and that he lived in a series of foster
homes before a rabbi in Queens took him in as a teen-ager. He was
unmarried.
   ``You got the sense that he had a thing for children, that what
happened to him wouldn't happen to anyone else,'' said Rapps.
   ``He was a very strange and enigmatic fellow,'' Bayer said. ``I
don't want to gloss this over. He was a loner, a restless,
imaginative and tortured soul. And it was shaped by a very poor and
traumatic childhood.''

<P>
With the school year in high gear, it's a good time to consider new additions 
to children's home reference libraries. 
</P>
<P>
For children ages 8 to 14, there is the new "The Kids' World Almanac of the 
United States" (Pharos-World Almanac; $14.95 hardcover, $6.95 soft-cover), with 
the history, facts and trivia about each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
This easy-to-use reference book features brief sketches of each state's origin 
and how it became part of the United States. Also included: state capitals, 
geography, symbols, special state events and attractions -- and just plain 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
For example: In Oklahoma, it is against the law to get a fish drunk. Montana 
was named from the Spanish word for mountainous, which originated in the Latin 
montanus. The first capital of Utah was Filmore (1851-1856); Salt Lake City was 
selected in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
The almanac was written by Thomas G. Aylesworth. John Lane's informative and 
amusing illustrations highlight each chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Also new from Pharos-World Almanac: "The World Almanac InfoPedia," a 
single-volume visual encyclopedia designed for ages 8 to 16. It covers history, 
science, animal life, art, sports, language and more. It was compiled by 
Theodore Rowland-Entwistle and Jean Cooke ($17.95 hardcover, $8.95 soft-cover). 
</P>
<P>
The InfoPedia contains 12 chapters, each of which is divided into appropriate 
sections with relevant information about the topic. For example, the 
Communications chapter includes terms in the history of writing, a chronology 
of printing, key dates in telegraphy and photography, and radio and TV facts. 
</P>
<P>
The book has black-and-white illustrations, and also includes a world atlas and 
flags of the world in full color. 
</P>
<P>
Pharos-World Almanac also publishes Aylesworth's "The Kids' World Almanac of 
Baseball"; "The Kids' World Almanac of Animals and Pets" by Deborah Felder; and 
"The Kids' World Almanac of Records and Facts" and "The Second Kids' World 
Almanac of Records and Facts" by Margo McLoone-Basta and Alice Siegel (all 
available in soft-cover, $6.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
"The Doubleday Children's Encyclopedia," designed for youngsters 7 to 11, 
bridges the gap between single-subject picture books and formal reference 
books. The four-volume set, edited by John Paton and Roberta Wiener, is indexed 
and cross-referenced, and contains more than 2,000 color illustrations 
($69.95). 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 entries cover presidents and world leaders, geography, health 
and biology, space, politics, nature, history and social issues. There are 
brief summaries of basic statistics, colorful charts, maps and diagrams. 
Detailed photo captions augment the main text. Simple home experiments are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Also of note: 
</P>
<P>
"The Lost Wreck of the Isis" by Robert Ballard is the latest adventure in the 
Time Quest Series from Scholastic-Madison Press ($15.95 hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
Designed for children 8 to 12, it tells the story of Ballard's 1988 discovery 
of an ancient Roman shipwreck deep in the Mediterranean Sea. Ballard and his 
team explored the 20-mile wreck site with Jason, a high-tech, deep-water robot. 
</P>
<P>
"Exploring the Titanic," the story of Ballard's discovery of the R.M.S. 
Titanic, was the first in the Time Quest series. Ballard is a senior scientist 
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Each Time Quest book focuses on a recent scientific discovery, using 
easy-to-understand text, full-color photographs, illustrations and paintings. 
Upcoming titles include: Ballard's "Exploring the Bismarck," "The Spirit of 
Columbus" by John Dyson, "The Secrets of Vesuvius" by Sara Bisel, and "The Lost 
Expedition" by Owen Beattie and John Geiger.

<HEAD>World Almanac Says Symington is Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Almanac appears to have jumped the gun
regarding the outcome of Arizona's gubernatorial election.
   According to The 1991 World Almanac and Book of Facts, Fife
Symington is the new governor.
   However, after the Nov. 6 general election votes were counted,
neither Republican Symington nor his Democratic opponent, Terry
Goddard, received a majority and a runoff election was declared for
Feb. 26.
   Two million copies of the almanac are hitting the bookstore
shelves this week containing the wrong information.
   ``We go to press practically as soon as the results are in on
Election Day night,'' said Martha Clarke, publicity manager for
Pharos Books, a subsidiary of Scripps Howard, which has published
the almanac since 1986.
   ``The governors of the states, except in your case, apparently,
are correct,'' Ms. Clarke said. ``Literally, the editor in chief is
writing down the results on his way to the printing press.''
   Although there is no mention of a runoff, a section titled ``The
Race for Governor: 1990'' mentions that the results are
``preliminary.''
   The almanac shows Symington with 519,558 votes to Goddard's
515,999.
   After all precincts were counted, official election results show
Symington with 523,984 to Goddard's 519,691 votes out of more than
1.09 million votes cast.
   ``They got it wrong and they'll have to change it in February,''
Goddard said. ``They'll have to buy a lot of white-out.''
   Symington, who has referred to the runoff campaign as a
``re-election'' bid, said, ``I think it's very amusing, and
hopefully, it's a good omen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Old Saying: If You Can't Forecast Well, Forecast Often</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the last century or thereabouts it was
pretty easy to forecast the weather by how the sky looked or how
birds, caterpillars and other creatures behaved. Anybody could do
it, and many did.
   Everybody talked about the weather, especially farmers and their
neighbors. There was talk about hard times, too, and how it seemed
nobody was doing anything about it.
   If times were good, farmers kept their mouths shut, knowing that
another drought or something bad was right around the corner.
   Not much was heard about economic forecasts, though. Somebody in
the government or a big-shot financier occasionally said something,
but scientifically developed projections did not abound.
   Today's economic forecasting, once as primitive as predicting
the weather from the loops in chicken entrails, has come a long
way, to be sure. But agricultural economists still have their
problems with weather, the greatest single variable confronting
farmers.
   And the agricultural economist's weather map is a lot bigger
these days, global, in fact. Hundreds of people in the Agriculture
Department, for example, look at and analyze world weather
conditions.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
weather isn't the only guidepost. Domestic and foreign polices of
other countries, demand trends, population growth and economic
growth are all part of the package.
   Farmers have little defense against ``uncertain events'' that
occur because of government actions or as a result of major
variations in world weaher patterns, he said. That was evident
during the agricultural boom of the 1970s and the bust of the 1980s.
   ``Who could have foretold the devastatingly late and poor
monsoon in Asia and its effect on the 1987 crop and on world
prices?'' Edwards said. ``What farmer could have said in the early
1980s, `I choose to farm in an economy with a larger money supply
and therefore with lower interest rates'?''
   Edwards added: ``Because of the unpredictability of major events
that affect the national and international agricultural economies,
it is getting harder to know how to use economic forecasts.''
   One solution would be to simply accept a forecast and act
accordingly. Farmers often do that when dealing about events and
processes with which they are familiar, he said. The likely
response of corn yields to fertilizer applications, or milk yields
in response to feeding rates are examples.
   And some economic forecasts are hedged by giving users a set of
possible outcomes that illustrate the uncertainties. For example,
the agency's forecast of net cash farm income this year is in a
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   ``A farm equipment manufacturer for whom this forecast is
important might determine then consequences if the actual outcome
is at one end of the range or the other, and then attach a degree
of confidence to each of the two outcomes,'' Edwards said. ``Using
this information, a manager can work out the best position to take.
This is one way to allow for known risks.''
   But Edwards acknowledged in an article published in the May
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that it is getting harder
for farmers to make decisions when they are increasingly faced by
uncertainties caused by events which they can neither predict nor
control.
   ``Greater exposure to these uncertainties has come along with
U.S. farmers' increasing dependence on world markets,'' he said.
``Two major sources of risk ... are climatic events in other
hemispheres and the policies and actions of governments.''
   A classic example of a global influence on American farmers is
the Soviet Union. Since 1972, when Moscow secretly bought the
equivalent of one-fourth of that year's U.S. wheat crop, weather in
the Soviet Union has been watched almost as intently as it is in
Kansas and Iowa.
   The huge 1972 purchases led to a bilateral agreement several
years later, pledging the Soviet Union to buy U.S. wheat and corn
on a sustained annual basis. That was one attempt to soften some of
the variables connected with the export trade.
   ``United States and Soviet government policy changes can
exacerbate the effect that Russian weather patterns have on U.S.
wheat producers,'' Edwards said. ``There was a time when the
U.S.S.R. tended to tighten its collective belt after a short crop.
Now the Soviets are more likely to seek imports to stabilize their
livestock economy, with larger needs in some years and smaller
needs in others.''
   The Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, is a more recent example
of the U.S. government trying to soften some of the variables for
American farmers by providing subsidies of taxpayer-owned surplus
grain to exporters so they can sell wheat and other designated
commodities to selected foreign buyers, including the Soviet Union,
at bargain prices.
   Other USDA activities, such as the Targeted Export Asssistance
program, or TEA, help promote U.S. commodities in foreign markets.
   It's all part of the forecasting business and must be taken into
consideration when department economists make predictions.
   ``Still, farmers' plans based on forecasts can receive as great
a shock from, say, the weather affecting the soybean crop in South
America this May and June as from the weather on their own farm,''
Edwards said.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 5 grafs new to include climate assessment, picks up 3rd

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weather forecasters today were offering
drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate
outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
   A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said ``many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.''
   The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to
the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms.
   On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in
the outlook for several crops.
   That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the
National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from
the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short
of rain.
   That area, which includes the major grain-growing states where
crops already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of less
than normal rainfall.
   And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West
Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even
drier. They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of
precipitation.
   A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the
driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having
below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be
dry, the forecast said.
   The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than
normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to
Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area,
the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in Wyoming,
while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above
average temperatures.
   Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south
Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal
precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states,
along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States.
   The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for
the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast
states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but
the far West is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat.
   The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out
that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry
spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an
end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of
past droughts, the agency said.
   The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the
continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme
drought, with parts of 35 states affected. That puts the current
drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe
than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.

<HEAD>Region to Region, It's Premature to Predict Drought But Not Too Soon
to Worry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Do this winter's mild, dry conditions in many parts of the nation
bode ill for the 1989 growing season? Is the unusual weather causing
problems already? It depends on where the questions are asked, and
of whom. Here are the findings of Associated Press reporters who
surveyed each region.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Corn Belt</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still
parched Corn Belt, where it's premature to predict another year of
pain, but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will
bring farmers a harsh spring.
   Though thousands of acres of Midwest farm fields were ravaged by
the drought of '88, much of the eastern Corn Belt _ an area east of
the Mississippi River _ is in moderately good shape because of
abundant rain last fall.
   ``We've come a long way from where we were at the end of the
growing season,'' said Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist for the
U.S. Agriculture Department. ``It will be very important to see what
happens in the next three months filling in holes where it remains
dry.''
   Experts say west-central Illinois, eastern Iowa, northern
Missouri and southern Minnesota have yet to recover from the drought.
   The difference in Corn Belt conditions is reflected in
precipitation since Oct. 1. The western section received 74 percent
of normal precipitation, while the eastern Corn Belt received 119
percent, said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of the Weather
Services Corporation in Massachusetts.
   Even with above average rains, conditions are so dry it'll take
time for the baked earth to return to rich black prairie soil.
Though Iowa had normal moisture since August, it still had only
21.64 inches of precipitation in 1988, the lowest level since 1910,
said state climatologist Harry Hillaker.
   ``It's going to take six to 12 months of normal rain to get
things back to the way it should be,'' he said.
   Dry weather not only affects corn, but another major Midwest crop
_ soybeans, which in 1988 were at their lowest production level
since 1976: 1.54 billion bushels.
   Beyond crops, the unusually warm, snow-scarce winter has
disappointed Wisconsin snowmobilers, postponed some farm equipment
purchases and led some Iowa towns to dig new wells.
   Still, experts say there's no reason to panic _ now.
   ``It's too early to worry about not having a crop,'' said Neil
Harl, an Iowa State University economics professor. ``But it's not
too early to worry about the consequences if you did.''

<NOTE>The Northeast</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a hard winter for Virginia Cochran, owner of a
Richmond, Vt., ski area. Not because of winter weather, but because
of the lack of it.
   ``I thought last year was bad in terms of lack of snow,'' she
said, ``but compared to this year, it was pretty good.''
   Scarcity of snow isn't a worry just to small ski operators.
Officials throughout the Northeast are keeping a nervous eye on
half-filled water reservoirs. Farmers fret about soil moisture.
Businesses selling snowmobiles and snowplows are hurting.
   ``This is disastrous,'' said Steve Kitchen, who has sold half the
usual number of snow tires at his Biddeford, Maine, service station.
   The winter of 1988-89 is likely to be remembered as the Winter of
No Snow.
   ``This has been the driest January in 104 years,'' said Richard
Mamrosh, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Burlington, Vt.
Vermont's Champlain Valley has had 19.9 inches of snow compared to
the normal average of 42 inches.
   The story is the same from Maine as far south as Maryland.
``Generally, we have had below normal snowfall,'' said Frank
Lucadamo, a hydrologist with the weather service's Northeast River
Forecast Center. ``If this continues we could see some problems.''
   Problems are already evident. Officials in Massachusetts, New
York and New Jersey have issued warnings about water supplies.
Reservoirs that supply some big Eastern cities are about 30 percent
below normal levels.
   ``Not only are we well below what we normally are, but there is
no snow upstate and you rely on the melt off of that snowpack in the
spring,'' said Tina Casey, a spokeswoman for the New York City
Department of Environmental Protection.
   The lack of a snowpack has had a wide range of effects. The
Finance Authority of Maine plans to provide $1 million in emergency
loans to struggling shopkeepers who can't find buyers for snow
machines. Farmers in New Hampshire fear the lack of snow cover will
kill off alfalfa fields.
   Buffalo, N.Y.'s city boosters are having problems organizing the
city's annual winter festival. ``We might as well call it
``Summerfest,'' said Robert Carr, a spokesman for the Greater
Buffalo Chamber of Commerce.

<NOTE>The Great Plains</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As the drought of 1988 becomes the drought of '89, the nation's
breadbasket is worried about producing half a loaf this year.
   Last year's drought hit hard at the Great Plains states, which
produce most of the hard red winter wheat, the primary grain in
bread.
   Lack of moisture this winter in the heartland has agronomists and
statisticians nervous because another below-average crop could
further deplete America's grain reserves and raise food prices.
   Planted in the fall, winter wheat lies dormant until spring, when
it matures and ripens. It is harvested in the summer.
   Farmers in Kansas, the country's No. 1 wheat-growing state, and
Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas all say they've been
short-changed on moisture since 1980, with last year's drought the
worst on record for many of them.
   In the past few months rain and snowfall have been sparse and
spotty. Eastern Montana and North Dakota are a little better off
than the last two years, Kansas and Nebraska are a little worse.
Colorado is about even. In South Dakota, which lost 68 percent of
its wheat crop last year, the autumn rains didn't come.
   ``At the end of the year we were about seven inches behind in
annual precipitation,'' said Eldon Thiessen, deputy statistician for
the Kansas Agricultural Statistics office. ``The ground was so dry
this fall the wheat never developed a good root system. The soil is
so loose that if the wind starts to blow the crop will be
destroyed.''
   Sumner County, Kan., annually produces more wheat than any other
county in the nation. Last year its farmers harvested 13.8 million
bushels, but county extension agent Gerald LeValley says an
unusually warm winter, lack of snow and rain and the appearance of
bugs in January all have him worried.

<HEAD>Drought Shriveling Crops, Driving Up Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops
and pastures, driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers
jobless. Community water use restrictions are in place in
California, the Midwest and the Southeast.
   ``It's not total destruction for all these crops yet, but
another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the
point of no return,'' said Richard Grove, agricultural extension
agent for Seneca County, Ohio.
   In addition, low water threatens to disrupt shipping on rivers
in the South and hydroelectricity there and in the Northwest.
   These are the problem areas:
   _Southeast: Parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama have had below-normal rainfall for up to four years.
Atlanta and six surrounding counties have water conservation
programs.
   The hardest-hit reservoir is North Carolina's Fontana Lake,
which is 45 feet below normal. Some private wells have gone dry in
North Carolina.
   _Midwest and northern Plains: A hot, dry spring and less than
normal winter snow has left the soil so dry in some places that
seeds didn't germinate. Some farmers in northwestern Ohio have
plowed crops under rather than spend more money on fertilizer.
North Dakota Gov. George Sinner says the drought is the worst since
the 1930s.
   Thunderstorms on Sunday produced much-needed rain over parts of
the Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota. Mobridge, S.D., got 1.47
inches of rain in six hours and Jamestown, N.D., got 0.8 inch, but
the region will need more rain to replace subsoil moisture.
   Areas of Illinois are restricting water use and residents in the
Chicago suburb of Long Grove complain about dry wells, saying they
suspect their neighbors of using all the water. Long Grove
administrator D.M. Doughty said one woman's well ran dry while her
neighbor across the street had three or four sprinklers going.
``It's kind of hard to love your neighbor,'' he said.
   The northern Plains' problem is shared by farmers in Canada,
where Old Wives Lake, a 12-mile-wide expanse south of Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan, is bone dry for the first time since 1937.
   _West Coast: San Francisco and Los Angeles have imposed
mandatory water rationing in the wake of light winter snow in the
mountains, where the snowpack is a natural reservoir. Growers have
been told that irrigation allotments may be cut.
   That lack of snow also has left hydroelectric reservoirs falling
on the Columbia River in Washington, at the same time water must be
released from those reservoirs to help migrating salmon.
   During the past month, the grain futures market in Chicago has
surged upward as traders bet on smaller and smaller harvests.
Soybean futures rose 25 percent during the past month and last week
broke the $9-a-bushel barrier, highest since late 1983. Oats traded
up by the daily limit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _
on four of the five trading days last week.
   The market opened sharply lower Wednesday after reports that
parts of west-central Iowa got rain, with 5.2 inches at Coon Rapids
and 1.79 at Des Moines. But other parts of the state stayed dry.
   The price of soybeans for July delivery closed slightly lower
Friday on the strength of forecasts for rain early this week, but
that was a decline of just 2 cents.
   Iowa's statistical bureau said the state's pastures were at
their June 1 driest since 1956.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department cited dry weather on the Plains
in May when it reported that farmers were harvesting an estimated
1.57 billion bushels of winter wheat. That's slightly more than
last year but 3 percent _ 50 million bushels _ less than a
prediction issued a month earlier.
   ``Corn is just lying there. Not enough moisture to germinate it.
Some early corn is barely surviving,'' said Bobby Peek,
agricultural extension agent in Buncombe County, N.C. ``Transplants
of tobacco are dying. They stood there for a few days, and now
they're starting to die. I never have known a spring like this and
nobody you talk to has, either.''
   The situation is acute for dairy farmers because grass to feed
livestock is wilting or not growing as fast as usual, and they also
depend on hay grown at this time of year to feed their animals in
the winter.
   The Agriculture Department is already allowing farmers to cut
hay or let animals graze on land that was set aside for crop
reduction or conservation in struggling counties in Montana, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio.
   Some farmers are selling cattle earlier than usual to avoid
rising feed prices.
   ``Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. The
yield from the first cutting was way down and there won't be much
of a second cutting,'' said Don Keyes of the Minnesota Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Much of the state has had
less than half normal rain this year.
   Hundreds of migrant workers who journey north to the Red River
Valley along the upper Minnesota-North Dakota border every year to
thin and weed sugar beets are finding there's no work waiting for
them.
   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after a
killing frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the dry
soil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.

'THOREAU OF THE AMERICAN WEST,' EDWARD ABBEY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Abbey, the irreverent writer and impassioned environmentalist whose 
popular books perpetuated their author's dream of seeing "the whole American 
West made into a wilderness," has died in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
The man dubbed "the Thoreau of the American West" by "Lonesome Dove" author 
Larry McMurtry died Tuesday at his home at age 62 of internal bleeding caused 
by a circulatory disorder, said Jack Macrae, a friend who also is 
editor-in-chief of Henry Holt &amp; Co., Abbey's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey recently had completed a draft of "Hayduke Lives," a sequel to his 
best-known book, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," which told of a group of 
environmentalists plotting to blow up Arizona's Glen Canyon Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of paperback copies of "The Monkey Wrench Gang" were sold 
after its publication in 1976, making Abbey a sort of underground hero to the 
burgeoning environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
His writings have been credited by founders of the hard-line environmental 
group Earth First! with providing the underpinnings of their philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hayduke Lives" would be the 20th book by the one-time park ranger, firefighter 
and political radical. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade outdoorsman once said there was nothing wrong with throwing beer 
cans out car windows, since paved roads were abominations and unworthy of 
respect. He had grown to hate the survey stakes, aircraft and golf courses that 
marred his once-pristine desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Anthologies refer to him as "irascible," "cantankerous," "iconoclastic" and 
"crusty." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey himself resisted simple summations, even those calling him 
environmentalist or naturalist. "If a label is required," he once wrote, "say 
that I am one who loves the unfenced country." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he found himself "getting more radical as I get older," 
as he told The Times last year, he was not without a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Outside magazine asked Abbey for an almanac of the high and low 
points of the 1975-85 decade. 
</P>
<P>
Under "Low Point" he wrote: "Beef ranchers in Montana and Wyoming harvest 155 
'troublesome' grizzlies." 
</P>
<P>
The "High Point" read: "Grizzlies in Montana and Wyoming harvest 22 
'troublesome' tourists." 
</P>
<P>
In "One Life at a Time Please" he offered essays guaranteed to offend everyone 
he touched. Cattlemen were "nothing more than Western parasites." Recent 
arrivals to the West were "instant rednecks." 
</P>
<P>
But Abbey represented far more than the wise-cracking, one-time farm boy he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of "Desert Solitaire," Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edwin Way 
Teale noted that Abbey's work as a park ranger had brought him to the 
wilderness before the invasion of "the parked trailers, their windows blue 
tinged at night while the inmates, instead of watching the desert stars, watch 
TV and listen to the canned laughter of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
He called Abbey "a voice crying in the wilderness, for the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey was born on a small farm in Appalachia and, after a stint in the Army, 
hitchhiked West in 1946. He studied English and philosophy at the University of 
New Mexico and turned to writing while supporting himself at odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He worked off and on for both the National Park Service and the Forest Service 
as a road inspector, auto assembly line worker and ditch digger. 
</P>
<P>
"I pounded survey stakes before I ever got the notion to pull them out," he 
told The Times in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although he became a champion of the outdoors, he was not one to rhapsodize its 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
He faulted writers "gushing about finding God in every bush." 
</P>
<P>
"I sat on a rock in New Mexico once," he said, "trying to have a vision. The 
only vision I had was of baked chicken." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey's most recent novel, "The Fool's Progress," was published late last year. 
His other books included "Good News," a futuristic novel about life in America; 
"The Journey Home," "Down the River," "Beyond the Wall" and "Abbey's Road." 
</P>
<P>
For years he had lived in the Sonora desert in a modest home with a chain-link 
fence enclosing a stand of palms. 
</P>
<P>
His writing studio stood out back ringed by the toys that were testament to the 
children who lived there (he and his wife had two while he had three from four 
previous marriages). 
</P>
<P>
Known not at all for his religious beliefs, he wrote what could only be called 
an invocation in his "Desert Solitaire," a 1968 book he said was inspired by 
"two seamless perfect seasons" with the Arches Park Service in Utah: 
</P>
<P>
"May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most 
amazing view. 
</P>
<P>
"May your rivers . . . meander through pastoral valleys tinkling with bells, 
past temples and castles and poets' towers into a dark primeval forest where 
tigers belch and monkeys howl. . . ."

<TEXT>     The 1991 Information Please Almanac Atlas and Yearbook lists Tony Knowles
as governor of the 49th state. Oops!;    Knowles, a former Anchorage mayor,
was the Democratic candidate for governor in November's general election and
had been an early favorite to win. Walter Hickel, a former Alaska governor and
interior secretary in the Nixon cabinet, jumped into the race late in the game
and won as an independent.;    Trouble is, nobody apparently told the folks at
Information Please Almanac in New York.;    "This is baffling," Otto Johnson,
editor of the almanac, said when notified of the mistake Wednesday.;    "I'm
embarrassed," Johnson said. "I don't know what to say. I'm very unhappy about
it.";    A competing desk reference, the World Almanac and Book of Facts for
1991, lists Hickel as governor, but has Stephen McAlpine down as lieutenant
governor, a post McAlpine vacated last month.;    "It's not an error. It's
simply the timing," said World Almanac editor Mark Hoffman, noting that a
footnote explains all officials listed below the status of governor were in
office as of mid-1990.;    In order to hit the bookstores before the Christmas
buying season, the World Almanac began printing three days after the Nov. 6
election. Only some last-minute results could be plugged in, Hoffman said.
Governors made the cut. Lieutenant governors didn't.;    Johnson said entries
also had come down to the wire for his publication, and somebody dropped the
ball on election reporting.;    He said he will write Hickel apologizing for
the slip.;    Hickel spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton said the governor had been
told of the error and was entertained.;    "He though it was pretty funny,"
she said. "This is just a hoot."  </TEXT>

<HL> Soybean Futures Decline Sharply As Rains Set In --- Temporary Drought Relief Sparks Third-Steepest Drop in Key Price Index </HL>
<AUTHOR> Scott Kilman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> CMD SCR </IN>
<DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temporary break in the drought sparked the steepest one-day plunge in soybean futures prices since 1973. 

   Heavier-than-expected rains across much of the Western Farm Belt on Tuesday and yesterday, as well as forecasts for a better chance of rain for the next several days in some farm states, also deflated corn, wheat and oat futures prices for the second consecutive day. 

   The big plunge in crop prices was primarily responsible for the third-sharpest decline in the history of the Commodity Research Bureau futures price index, a closely watched inflation indicator composed of a wide range of commodities prices, including oil, metals and lumber. 

   The index closed yesterday at 260.71, down 6.49 points. 

   The drop in grain prices buoyed some cattle prices, which had fallen in recent weeks as the rising cost of livestock feed spurred ranchers to sell their cattle and glut the market. 

   The hardest-hit farm commodity was soybeans, which had skyrocketed in value in recent weeks on speculation that the three-month-old drought could slash already dwindling stockpiles. 

   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean contract for July delivery plummeted 83.5 cents a bushel to $9.31 a bushel, the biggest one-day plunge since June 1973, when the price of the contract dropped more than $1.67 a bushel in one day, according to Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. 

   The depth of yesterday's price drop was extraordinary. 
Normally, the Board of Trade limits how much commodity prices can move daily. 
The limit on soybean futures prices, for example, is 30 cents a bushel when trading is quiet, or 45 cents a bushel when prices have been moving their daily limit, as they have this week. 

   The exception is when a contract nears its month of delivery. 
The Board of Trade then removes the price limits. 
That began yesterday on July contracts and cleared the way for the wild ride down, analysts said. 

   The across-the-board price plunge was sparked by growing dissension among meteorologists about whether the worst of the drought is over and growing speculation among traders that the big rally in some crop prices is running out of fuel. 

   Most weather forecasters as recently as Monday saw little change in the pattern that has spawned dry weather over much of the Midwest and Great Plains since the spring. 
Indeed, many continue to see no break in the drought. 
After the close of trading yesterday, the official six-to-10-day forecast by the National Weather Service called for below-normal precipitation in major growing states such as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and the Mississippi Delta region. 

   The National Weather Service also forecast below-normal precipitation for the central and Eastern corn-growing belt for all of July. 

   However, some private meteorologists are beginning to forecast that the worst of the dry weather is passing. 
One indication was the widespread storms Tuesday and yesterday that delivered between half an inch and two inches of rain over much of the Midwest. 

   "It looks like the pattern has changed and there will be closer to normal rain for the next five to 10 days," said Joel Myers, president of Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa. 

   Regardless of the weather, some traders are speculating that the price of some crops will have a hard time rising much further. 
According to Richard Feltes, research director at Refco Inc., the futures price of corn earlier this week had outstripped the level reached in previous droughts. 

   What's more, a shortage of corn is less likely than in previous droughts because the stockpile of corn in the country is near record high levels. 
"In the weeks ahead we are going to see apprehension in the corn market," he said. 

   Other experts believe the big rise in grain prices is making futures contracts too volatile. 
"For the past week and a half, we've told people not to get into the grains or soybeans if they're not in already," said Catherine A. Jones, manager of the commodity department at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. 

   Many traders, however, expect grain prices to resume rising. 
Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, is predicting that the corn contract for December delivery could rise 20% to $4 a bushel if hot and dry weather hits during mid-July, when moisture is critical to the corn crop's ability to pollinate. 

   In addition to weather, another uncertainty surrounding corn prices in July is what farmers will do with the 1.3 billion bushels of corn that the government is releasing to them. 
The corn has been held off the market by the government as collateral for farm loans. 
Under terms of the program, farmers can repay the loans and get back their corn because cash prices in the Farm Belt have risen to the release trigger of $3.03 a bushel. 
Most farmers are expected to horde the corn in anticipation of rising prices or for fear of a livestock feed shortage. 

   Most analysts don't think the rally in soybean prices is over, if for no other reason than that stockpiles in the country are relatively low.

   Record-cold arctic air trapped over Alaska finally broke loose
and barreled into the lower 48 states, dropping a bitter winter into
the laps of springlike northern cities in a matter of minutes.
   Temperatures plunged by nearly 80 degrees in a day, with one town
reporting a 23-degree drop in one minute. High winds preceding the
cold front blew a toddler down a street in Lander, Wyo.
   The polar air outburst, accompanied today by blizzards driven by
winds over 100 mph, stunned residents of the northern Plains and
Midwest, where ski slopes and ice festivals had been abandoned for
golf courses and tennis courts.
   The frigid air, no longer trapped by a warm-air jet stream that
had strayed farther north than usual and left record-high
temperatures in 64 cities Tuesday, promised frigid weekend weather
for the East Coast and as far south as Arkansas, the National
Weather Service said.
   ``We're going to make up for the party we've been enjoying,''
said meteorologist Rick Brumer in Chicago.
   The party ended quickly on Tuesday, as arctic air rushed into the
balmy northern Plains, including Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming,
dropping temperatures to 10 to 20 below zero. High winds and blowing
snow knocked out power in Washington state _ Seattle got a rare
snowfall in the worst winter storm in more than three years _ and
parts of Montana.
   Valentine, Neb., reached a record high of 70 degrees and dropped
to zero degrees within 10 hours. The mercury plunged 33 degrees in
one hour after the cold front passed Valentine. In Russell, Kan.,
which had the national high temperature of 84 Tuesday afternoon, it
was 12 degrees this morning.
   In a 24-hour period beginning Monday morning, temperatures fell
79 degrees at Great Falls, Mont., from 62 above to 17 below zero.
The state braced for even colder weather today as the system
continued southward.
   ``It's the coldest air mass in the last five years, since
December of 1983,'' said Bruce Thoricht, a weather service
meteorologist at Billings.
   In the town of Cut Bank, about 100 miles north of Helena, a
Federal Aviation Administration official said the temperature
plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds dropped the wind
chill to 75 below zero.
   ``It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier County
Undersheriff Bill Barron.
   In Lander, winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2-year-old boy
down the street, said his mother, Pamela Roberts, who chased after
him. The toddler was not seriously hurt.
   ``He fell and the wind dragged him along on his face,'' said
Roberts, 27. ``I was trying to hold him and trying to open the
door.''
   In the Plains, ranchers worked to secure cattle, particularly
newborn calves, in areas that basked in temperatures in the 60s
Tuesday but shivered in dangerous wind-chills down to 40 and 50
below this morning.
   ``It's a shock to anything's system, when you have a 100-degree
drop in temperature,'' said Tom Scott, executive director of the
Nebraska Beef Industry Development Board.
   In another way, the cold snap was good news for farmers who
suffered through drought last summer and faced more worries for the
coming season because of the dry winter.
   ``Given how dry it has been, it's better to have colder weather
because there's less chance of evaporation losses'' from the soil,
said Iowa state climatologist Harry Hillaker.
   Blizzards hit Tuesday in northwestern Minnesota, southeast North
Dakota and southern Montana. Cut Bank had 5 inches of snow and
Helena 4. Blowing, drifting snow dropped visibility to almost zero
in parts of Montana and Minnesota. Snowfall was light this morning
in most areas, but forecasters said more wind-whipped snow was
predicted in the upper Plains and Midwest tonight.
   The Minnesota state patrol closed a 50-mile stretch of highway in
the west-central part of the state for nearly 11 hours through this
morning, and troopers Tuesday night led about 100 stranded motorists
the 10 miles from Glyndon to Moorhead because Glyndon had no
accommodations for them.
   ``It was pretty treacherous going,'' said Dave Haug of West
Fargo, N.D., who drove the lead car in the convoy. ``I'm just glad I
got home.''
   Snow also fell in Washington state, where Snohomish and Spokane
got up to 5 inches.
   Two inches of snow were recorded in 24 hours at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport, enough to close the airport for nearly an
hour this morning. About 200 minor traffic accidents were reported
by early morning in the region, police said. It was Seattle's worst
winter weather since November 1985, when 17 inches of snow fell in
the month.
   Where snow didn't fall, high winds fanned a prairie fire in
Nebraska that consumed 8,000 acres and burned several farm buildings
but destroyed only one house.
   The cold air had been trapped over Alaska by a dome of extremely
high pressure. The barometer at Northway, Alaska, rose to a North
American record high of 31.85 inches of mercury, the weather service
reported Tuesday.
   The pressure was so high that the FAA late Tuesday restricted
flights over Alaska. Airplane instruments that use atmospheric
pressure to calculate altitude are not designed for such high
pressure and may give innacurate readings, officials said.
   Before the warm jet stream shifted south and freed the arctic
air, high-temperature records were broken or tied in 64 cities from
Colorado to Ohio and from northern Texas into southern Minnesota.
Dodge City, Kan., soared to 80 degrees, surpassing the record of 76
set in 1911; Chicago climbed to 65, breaking its 1877 record of 56;
Louisville, Ky., hit 67, also breaking a 112-year-old record;
Detroit climbed to 60, breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890;
Grand Island, Neb., reached 72; and Fort Smith, Ark., hit 77.
   ``The upper air wind patterns are normally different than they
would be this time of year,'' said Brian Smith of the National
Weather Service Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``Normally we have the jet stream across the continental U.S.
It's been further north. ... Weather systems couldn't move through.''
   Finally, he said today, ``we've had a buckle in it.''
   Authorities reported no deaths or injuries directly attributable
to the cold. However, on Tuesday the body of a man whose skiff was
swamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeast
Alaska was found on a beach.
   The warmth that preceded the cold front was indirectly
responsible for the death of a Wisconsin woman Tuesday aboard a sled
that sank in a lake where warnings had been issued several times
about untrustworthy ice.

   An elderly South Texas weather prognosticator
assures George Bush's inaugural planners their worst nightmare _ a
snowstorm _ won't come true to ruin the festivities surrounding
Bush's swearing-in as president on Jan. 20.
   ``This old gentleman from South Texas sent me his almanac, which
said the period from Jan. 19 to Jan. 23 will have sunny, warm and
pleasant weather in Washington, D.C.,'' said Bobby Holt, general
co-chairman of the President-elect's Inaugural Committee.
   Holt, a millionaire oil and gas tycoon and old friend of the vice
president from Midland, Texas, told reporters Wednesday he couldn't
recall the amateur weatherman's name and couldn't vouch for his
accuracy.
   ``I'm scared to call him and ask about his track record,'' Holt
said with a nervous laugh. He admitted the threat of a heavy storm
during the inauguration was ``a constant worry.''
   The National Weather Service said it couldn't predict
Washington's weather that far ahead, except to say that average
temperatures during the five days of inaugural events will range
from 43 degrees to a low of 27.
   One of the worst inaugural snowstorms in modern memory occurred
the night before John F. Kennedy took the presidential oath in 1960.
The storm dumped eight inches of snow on Washington, halting all
traffic and stranding guests trying to reach inaugural events.
   Army troops shoveled Pennsylvania Avenue clear of snowdrifts, and
by noon on Jan. 20 it was clear, sunny and 22 degrees when a hatless
Kennedy took the oath on the East Front steps of the Capitol.
   Because of extreme cold in January 1985, President Reagan moved
his official swearing-in for a second term from the West Front of
the Capitol inside to the Rotunda, and the traditional inaugural
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House was canceled.

   Like letters to a friend, the feelings
expressed in a survey of drought-weary retailers reveal the hurt,
despair and uncertainty gripping businesses as they struggle to
survive the worst drought in decades.
   ``I love my town and the people in it, but if this continues, we
are not going to be able to afford to live here,'' a Cavalier
County retailer wrote in response to a state Tax Department survey
on the drought.
   As the hot weather sucked the life from income-producing wheat
fields and pastures across the state, it dried up sales for many
store owners who deal with farmers, the surveys show.
   ``Some days you wonder if it's worth turning on the lights,''
said a Williams County business owner. ``You always wonder if Tom,
Dick or Harry will still be farming next year. By the same token,
we wonder if we'll still be here.''
   ``The way our books are looking at this time, we are in the red
and afraid of the long winter,'' said a Dickey County business
owner.
   The Tax Department mailed surveys to 700 retail businesses July
27, trying to measure how much state revenues might decline because
of the drought. About 280 businesses returned the questionnaires by
Aug. 10.
   The numbers provide the evidence of the drought's effects _ 64
percent of the respondents reported reduced sales from what the
owners had expected.
   Tax Commissioner Heidi Heitkamp agreed to make the surveys
public, but excluded the names of the businesses and any sales
figures. Respondents were promised confidentiality.
   ``It is just hard to see the hurt that is on these pages,'' she
said. ``It is hard to see the despair in the small towns.''
   One Barnes County business compared the state's economy to the
Great Depression. ``The dirty '80s have not left us, and I do not
look for a big increase in sales for several years.''
   ``It takes two years to get back to normal after a drought, in
my opinion,'' wrote a Foster County retailer. ``It is going to be a
long, hard winter for all of us.''
   ``We'll have to put all of our help on unemployment this fall,
and I had to take a second job! We may have to refinance just to
keep the doors open,'' wrote a Bottineau County businessman.
   One business reported surviving tough times for years due to dry
weather.
   ``By 1983, even our business was beginning to slow down,'' wrote
the Williams County store owner. ``Interesting note: One week in
July 1983 grossed more than the whole month of July 1988.''
   ``The drought is just another nail in the wooden box,'' said a
Mountrail County business that has also been hit by hard times in
the state's oil-producing sector.
   There were many pleas for help.
   ``Some place along the line, someone is going to have to help us
out,'' a Cavalier County business wrote. ``If that doesn't happen,
then you might, as it has been suggested, turn this area into a
great national park.''
   A handful of businesses sympathized with the farmers, but said
farmers always get bailed out of their problems.
   ``What about the small-business person? We never get help,'' a
Burleigh County respondent wrote.
   Three business owners used the surveys to write their companies'
obituaries.
   ``Our sales will drop to zero very soon as we intend to close
this business and seek employment in another state,'' one Grand
Forks County retailer wrote.
   But several retailers found a silver lining in the drought.
   ``We have sold twice as many bird baths than we expected to.
People are feeling sorry for the birds. It was a real different
twist for our sales,'' a Ward County retailer wrote.

   Two years ago, Carl Marriott's farm fields were dusty, his
soybeans were shriveled, his prospects bleak. This spring, he has a
different brown, sickly crop, but there's a different culprit: rain.
   Yes, rain, the manna from heaven Midwest farmers hoped and
prayed for these past few years, has flooded fields, delayed
planting and damaged crops. But survivors of one _ or even two _
consecutive droughts aren't complaining.
   ``We just roll with the punches. We've got options we can pull
out of the bag when it's wet,'' said Marriott, a southern Illinois
farmer who may lose a quarter of his waterlogged wheat crop. ``When
it's dry, there's nothing we can do.''
   ``We've been biting our tongues,'' said Mark White, a Chariton,
Iowa, farmer whose fields were parched in 1988 and '89, then too
muddy to work all last month. ``I'll take a wet year over a dry
year anytime. At least you've got a chance to grow something.''
   After the most devastating decade in half a century, marred by
drought, high interest rates and plummeting land values, many
farmers have entered the 1990s with one of the wettest springs in
recent times and the brightest outlook in 10 years.
   ``The farmer is in the best shape he's been since 1980,'' said
Gregory Hanson, an economist at the U.S. Agriculture Department.
``We've got rising land values ... rising sales, rising investment.
I'm not trying to paint a Pollyanna picture _ on the other hand,
there's the famous rubber ball theory of economics: What bounced
down is now bouncing up.''
   Though an unseasonably cool, wet spring may prevent a bumper
crop, the economic forecast is promising: cash income for the farm
sector, which includes government subsidies, has been projected at
$55 billion to $59 billion for 1990 _ a record if it reaches the
outer limit and better than last year's estimated $54 billion.
   Hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels, corn prices
are up because the surplus is down, farm exports have increased,
land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 _ about
the same level they did in 1989 _ and machinery sales have jumped
by 50 percent in the last four years.
   ``When I look at the farm economy, I look at a growth sector,''
Hanson said. ``Ten years ago, it was a sector ready to take a
fall.''
   The national farm debt, which peaked in 1983 at $206 billion,
could dip to as low as $145 billion in 1990, he said.
   Farmers who survived the '80s are smarter and more careful about
their purchases, said Neil Harl, an economics professor at Iowa
State University.
   ``Some have been burned, some were singed, some were just close
to the heat,'' he said. At the same time, he added, ``Lenders are
more cautious and conservative.''
   As the new decade begins, some signs of a turnaround are due to
the weather, some to a reversal in economic fortunes. For example:
   _ In Kansas, a record winter wheat crop is forecast for 1990 _
460.2 million bushels, more than double last year's
drought-battered 213.6 million bushels.
   ``They're laughing,'' Jim Shroyer, extension agronomist at
Kansas State University said of the farmers. ``They're really
looking forward to harvest. This really lifts their spirits.''
   Nationally, winter wheat production is expected to reach a
nine-year high of 2 billion bushels, despite some losses from wet
weather.
   _ In Iowa, land values jumped nearly 45 percent from 1986 to
1989, though they're still far below 1981 peak levels. Less than
one in five farmers had significant money troubles last year,
compared with a third in 1986, Harl said.
   _ In Minnesota, state officials say soil moisture is the best it
has been since November 1986.
   Despite such optimistic signs, drought persists in areas,
including Florida and parts of Colorado. In California, in its
fourth straight dry year, reservoirs are low enough that the state
and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation cut in half the amount of this
year's irrigation water to farmers.
   And in the upper Midwest, even though puddles in the fields make
people smile _ a recent wet spell in North Dakota was dubbed the
``million-dollar'' rain _ they haven't convinced anyone the drought
is over.
   ``By no means are we out of the woods,'' said Tim Edman, special
assistant to South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson. ``If we go back to
the 90-degree-plus windy, dry weather conditions, we could be
facing a proble very quickly just as serious as the last two
years.''
   In 1988, all of South Dakota was declared a drought disaster
area; last year, it was two-thirds of the state.
   While many cursed the drought, others now say rainy, cool
weather is no blessing.
   In Michigan, for example, some apple growers say it's reduced
their crop. In Missouri, a fourth of the corn is in poor or very
poor shape, and planting is five weeks behind schedule. And in
Illinois, pastures with water belly-high to the livestock and
fields too muddy to put a tractor in have farmers worried.
   ``It's rained so much our wheat is full of blight,'' said Herman
Krone, who welcomed then-President Reagan to his shriveled southern
Illinois farm fields in 1988. ``Instead of ripening, it's dying in
standing water. ... It's been 43 years since I've seen something
like this.''
   But it's too early to make dire predictions, and dry, sunny days
last week allowed many farmers to get back into the fields. Some
also say as time runs out to plant corn, they may switch to
soybeans, which have a later growing season.
   That's an option for Marriott, a fourth-generation farmer who
normally would have planted all his corn by now but had completed
less than 5 percent by the second week of June, a situation to
which he's resigned.
   ``Farming is hills and valleys,'' he said. ``You have good crops
some years, and some years, good prices _ seldom together.''
   ``It's either feast or famine,'' said Bill Million, agriculture
extension adviser in Adams County, in western Illinois. ``Farmers
are just taking it one day at a time.''
   Not long ago, Million said, they looked to the skies for
salvation _ rain.
   ``Now they're praying for it to stop _ just a bit,'' he said.
``Typical human beings, we're never satisfied.''
