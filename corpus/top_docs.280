   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter
the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and
nondescript.
   Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and
soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past
criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a
nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office building
planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the
capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the
50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is
a slender, post-modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways
and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high,
eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern.
   Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as
drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command
attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words
like ``gracious,'' ``truly wonderful,'' ``serene,'' ``imposing''
and ``glamorous'' to describe the tower.
   ``It certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world,''
said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It's just beautiful. Everybody's
just staggered by it.''
   The tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in
modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of
the city's tallest buildings.
   Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going
up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper
complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower.
   New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM
building with design consultant Philip Johnson, won't take credit
for transforming Atlanta's skyline. But he said the city's image,
as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change.
   ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,'' Burgee said in a
telephone interview from his New York office. ``It's an historical
city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical.
You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.' Now,
there is an attempt to come up with a visual image.
   ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don't think of its
buildings,'' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State
Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the
TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn't have that. It's moving
toward that, very definitely.''
   Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree
Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Another planned project grouped in the ``Son of IBM'' building
spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section,
a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by
AT&amp;T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group.
   When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of
glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the
excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson,
Ventulett &amp; Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above
rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire.
   The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by
Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily
through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin
Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
   Portman's new building is slated to begin construction next year
and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast's
tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was
``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold
and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern
architecture.''
   Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said
completion of the IBM tower signaled the acceleration of a change
in the look of the city that began a decade ago.
   ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, ``with no
development of architectural significance.''
   Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty
nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta)
blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn't have a clue
where you are.''
   Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an
identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going
up.
   Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office
buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of building
projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing.
   Some say that all the building activity simply makes good
business sense.
   ``Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good
business,'' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography
department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban
affairs.
   A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the
financing people as well as the tenants.''
   Hartshorn said he expects the new projects in Atlanta will bring
special recognition.
   ``I think it's going to open some eyes,'' he said. ``We have
prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don't know that our
office buildings are that distinctive nationally.
   ``These aren't just ultra post-modern. They're classic. They're
different.''

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County will add an unusual new building to its skyline -- which some 
critics have called boring and mundane -- with the addition next year of a 
21-story, stainless steel office tower near South Coast Plaza that was designed 
by renowned architect Cesar Pelli. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who recently designed what could become the world's tallest skyscraper 
in Chicago, Tuesday unveiled a model of the new Costa Mesa building, which is 
being jointly developed by the Segerstrom family and IBM Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The design has a curving facade of burnished steel facing inward toward a 
parking garage and walkway on one side. On its other side, the design presents 
a flat surface to passing motorists on Avenue of the Arts. The stainless steel, 
an unusual material for an office tower, is designed to give off a warm, 
coppery glow. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin in May and be completed in September, 1991. 
While it looks thoroughly modern, the design's details allude to the look of 
older office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who lived in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s and designed many 
buildings there, is one of the foremost architects in the nation. He is 
probably best known for designing graceful and daring skyscrapers in big 
cities. This will be his first building in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, the county's cityscape changed, from a low-slung suburb 
of single-family homes and one-story commercial buildings into a series of 
small urban areas where mid-rise office towers of 10 to 15 stories spring up in 
spiky clumps around malls or John Wayne Airport. One of these areas grew up 
around South Coast Plaza, the giant mall that became Costa Mesa's "new 
downtown" and that will be the new building's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new county buildings were boxy, glass structures with few 
distinguishing features, a result of the Modernist school of architecture that 
favors sleek, stark buildings with clean lines. These buildings often had the 
advantage of being cheaper to build than more elaborate designs too. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last 20 years or so, such Post-Modernist architects as Pelli have 
experimented with different building materials -- more expensive stuff such as 
granite, for instance -- and more complicated designs that often incorporate 
elements of earlier buildings, such as the soaring, big-city skyscrapers of the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these new buildings, of course, have been built in such cities as New 
York, Los Angeles and Chicago. But lately they have been appearing more 
frequently in such previously undistinguished suburban markets as Orange County 
and Tysons Corner, Va., outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the county's architecture has drawn little praise to date. For instance, 
the architecture critic of the New York Times, Paul Goldberger, complained in a 
1988 article that the county's architecture "celebrates not the whimsy of 
Disneyland, but the conformity of glass boxes and other architectural 
banalities." 
</P>
<P>
The county's biggest developers have begun hiring architects such as Pelli to 
design their own buildings for reasons both aesthetic and economic: 
</P>
<P>
* A building with an architectural pedigree is easier to rent to the classy 
tenants that landlords like, especially in an overbuilt office market such as 
Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
* There are so many office buildings in the county now that a building with a 
distinctive look may be easier to market. 
</P>
<P>
And there are some less tangible benefits: A developer such as the Irvine Co.'s 
Donald L. Bren, for instance, has a vision of how his vast landholdings should 
look and hires the best architects to make it so; there is also some 
civic-mindedness and a healthy dose of ego and one-upmanship involved in hiring 
prominent architects, local realty observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Few developers are quite so blunt as to acknowledge this, though, or to 
criticize each other's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This building is a little more daring, a little more creative than we've 
seen," said Henry T. Segerstrom, whose family owns South Coast Plaza and much 
of the land around it. "Orange County is at the stage where we need an 
identity, something very exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a mediocre community, and we want to elevate our standards of 
design." 
</P>
<P>
Working in the suburbs is often a new experience for such architects as Pelli. 
He said he did not tone down his imaginative ideas for the conservative county, 
although he acknowledged that he might have settled on a different building in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Every building must be part of its environment," Pelli said. "Architecture is 
the art of intelligent and creative response to that environment. But no, we 
didn't tone it down." 
</P>
<P>
Pelli is the latest in a string of renowned architects to work in Orange 
County. Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed TV minister Robert H. 
Schuller's Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. Helmut Jahn of Chicago is 
designing a small headquarters building in Dana Point for developers David 
Stein and Barry Brief. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli ranks with such glittering names. Born in Argentina 63 years ago, he was 
educated in Argentina and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He 
worked for several firms in Los Angeles before becoming dean of the School of 
Architecture at Yale University in 1977. He left in 1984. He now designs 
buildings through his firm, Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more prominent buildings Pelli has designed are: 
</P>
<P>
* A building that will be the world's tallest if built, just approved for 125 
stories by Chicago's City Council. It is to be 15 stories higher than Chicago's 
Sears Tower, now the world's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
* The big 777 Tower at Citicorp Plaza in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* The Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
* The expansion of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
* The World Financial Center in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
* Norwest Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
IBM is a big enough tenant -- especially in a slow office market -- to demand a 
piece of the ownership, so Segerstrom and IBM are partners in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Like Segerstrom, IBM has a history of hiring prestigious architects. In this 
case, the company has a practical objective too: The computer manufacturer is 
the largest tenant in Segerstrom buildings around South Coast Plaza and wanted 
to consolidate its offices and save on rent by building a new tower. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the building was to have been part of Segerstrom's giant Home Ranch 
project a mile or so north of the mall off the San Diego Freeway. But that 
project was killed by Costa Mesa voters. 
</P>
<P>
That building was planned as considerably taller, at 32 stories. The new 
building, much closer to the mall at the northwest corner of Avenue of the Arts 
and Anton Boulevard, would be just 21 stories, because of the proximity of 
flight paths around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who often designs much taller buildings, said he did not feel 
constrained by the relative smallness of the Segerstrom building. It will still 
be one of the tallest buildings in the county. 
</P>
<P>
IBM will occupy the first eight floors or so -- about 160,000 of the 440,000 
square feet -- and Segerstrom will lease the rest to tenants. IBM, unlike many 
big tenants in office buildings, says it does not put a big corporate sign on 
its buildings and will not on this one, saying it prefers not to distract from 
the architecture. 
</P>
<P>
While neither partner will comment, the building is expected to cost at least 
$90 million, based on current construction costs, and probably more because of 
the stainless steel's expense.

ON CALIFORNIA: A TRUMP CARD AND AN ACE UP THE SLEEVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Mr. Trump: 
</P>
<P>
We love it that you love L.A. As soon as we picked up our Sunday paper and saw 
-- right there on Page 1! -- your plans to tear down the ratty Ambassador Hotel 
and build the World's Tallest Building in its place, our smog-choked chests 
heaved with pride. Trumpomania, here at last! 
</P>
<P>
Do you wanna know how bad it was before you got here? Here's how bad: Just last 
summer we topped off the Library Tower building downtown and thought it was a 
big deal. Lotsa ink in the local sheets, and it was just a measly 73 stories 
tall. Now you pop into town, and right off you're talking 125 stories! 
</P>
<P>
That's why that scamp John Ferraro (he's our City Council president) was right 
on the mark at your press conference when he quipped, "Why did it take you so 
long to get to Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
And you just smiled like a chipmunk at that one. Heh, heh, you old faker. That 
stuff in New York, Trump Tower and all, that was just in prelude, wasn't it? 
And the casinos in Atlantic City, merely a warm-up, eh? Now you're gonna strut 
your real stuff, go for the works, and where? Los Angeles! We knew you wouldn't 
forget! 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe it's true that not everyone loves it that you love L.A. Maybe some 
grouches have claimed you showed up at your news conference without plans or 
drawings or descriptions of any of the new buildings, not even a sketch of the 
World's Tallest Building. And maybe the grumps wondered why the mayor and two 
city councilmen agreed to stand around like house plants at your news 
conference when they didn't know squat about what you intend or when. 
</P>
<P>
Well, let me give you a little advice: Those nattering negativos don't mean 
nothing. Here in L.A., we understand a high concept when we see it. Let the 
little people deal with details like traffic and congestion and design. Just 
keep repeating the phrase, "World's Tallest Building," and the mayor will show 
up to play house plant any time you need him. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is one thing I'm curious about. I noticed that, when you bought your 
share of the Ambassador property, you changed the name of the company from 
Wilshire Center Partners to Trump Wilshire Associates. And rightly so, of 
course. People should know who's ushering L.A. toward its future. 
</P>
<P>
But you didn't say what you intend to call the World's Tallest Building and its 
ensemble of Slightly Smaller Buildings. At first I thought that Trump City 
would do the trick. That way, see, your development could act as a counterpart 
to something called Century City, a little thing we built ourselves out on the 
Westside. Then I realized that was a bad idea. Compared to yours, Century 
City's buildings aren't tall at all, they're hardly even skyscrapers, and 
there's not nearly enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
So I was reading the news stories, looking for clues, when I read where you 
intend to employ "true California style" in the design of your buildings. This 
inspired me. How about "La Ciudad Trump," hmmm? It has that international ring 
to it. Or "Rancho Trump Deluxe?" Or, if you wanted to pick up on a lost theme 
of L.A. design, "Tail o' the Trump" might do nicely. These are just a couple of 
ideas, of course. We have a lot more if you need them. 
</P>
<P>
I have saved this last matter to the end because it's, well, sensitive to all 
of us here in Los Angeles. We understand that, in truth, you have also been 
working on another proposal for the World's Tallest Building, and that other 
proposal is located right smack in the middle of you-know-where. New York. We 
also understand -- and this is where it hurts -- that New York's World's 
Tallest Building is planned for 150 stories, 25 more stories than our World's 
Tallest Building. 
</P>
<P>
Yo, Don, what goes? Do you understand the insecurities you are stirring up 
here? Are we gonna be top dog, or is this another case where we get stuck with 
the old "biggest west of the Mississippi" monicker? We're real sick of the 
west-of-the-Mississippi business, Donnie. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky for us, there are solutions to this problem. You could always switch 
plans and go the full 150 here while you slipped the ol' 125 to New York. It 
would make their Tallest Building look like a termite mound, haw haw. This 
would be a favor we wouldn't forget, Donnie. We might even let you stick one of 
your dollar bills in wet cement at Grauman's, right next to Rin Tin Tin's paw 
prints. It's a high concept to think about.

   A New York real estate firm on
Monday announced plans to erect Europe's tallest building _ a
53-story, 838-foot office tower _ on sprawling fairgrounds in this
West German city.
   Tishman Speyer Properties said the project, which it valued at
$375 million, will be financed by Citibank.
   The skyscraper, with its 920,000 square feet of office space,
will surpass the Palac Kultury of Warsaw, Poland, as Europe's
tallest building. The Palac Kultury, has 42 stories and is 790 feet
tall.
   Frankfurt Mayor Wolfram Brueck said the building is expected to
be completed by 1991.
   Tishman Speyer President Jerry Speyer, appearing at a press
conference with the mayor, said his company already has received
rental inquiries about the building.
   Frankfurt, West Germany's flourishing banking and finance
center, has been expanding in recent years. New office buildings
have sprouted up in the city's center, and decaying downtown
neighborhoods have been renovated.
   The fairgrounds are not far from the city's downtown shopping
area, its main train station and banking district.
   Tishman Speyer manages a portfolio of properties valued at $4
billion, the company said in a statement. The company currently has
$1 billion worth of projects under development, including the
Beijing American Express Center, an office and apartment complex in
China.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Canary Wharf to share its bird's eye view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON is once again to have its own panoramic viewing platform. But, unlike
the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building, London's look-out point is miles
away from its most notable monuments.
One Canada Square, the steel-clad, 50-storey centrepiece of London
Docklands' Canary Wharf and the tallest building in the UK, is opening its
top floor to the public.
The decision to allow visitors has been taken to 'generate and maintain
interest in the Docklands', according to the administrators who were
appointed to the project in May.
At 800ft, the tower is 200ft higher than its nearest UK rival, the National
Westminster Tower in the City of London. On a clear day, the view from the
top can stretch for 30 miles.
Visitors will be charged Pounds 3 a person, but after additional security
and ticketing costs, this will do little to help the finances of the
project, which has debts estimated at Pounds 700m.
It will provide the first opportunity in nearly 20 years to visit the top of
the UK's tallest building. The 580ft Post Office tower (now the BT tower),
which held the record until the NatWest tower was built in 1980, has been
closed to the public since 1973, when a bomb exploded in the restaurant.
The Canary Wharf tower will be the tallest office building that can be
visited in Europe, since Frankfurt's 841ft 6in Messeturm is off limits to
visitors. However, an even loftier view is available from the the
iron-framed, 985ft 11in Eiffel Tower in Paris.
The tallest buildings in the US, the Sears Roebuck Building in Chicago and
the World Trade Center and Empire State Building in New York, also court
visitors. The world's tallest tower remains the 1,815ft CN Tower in Toronto,
while the UK's highest structure is the 1,265ft ITN mast in Lincolnshire.
The Canary Wharf tower will be open on Saturdays and Sundays, from 10am to
5pm, from September 12. On that weekend, the Docklands Light Railway will,
unusually, be open as it coincides with the European Oyster and Seafood
Fair, organised by the London Docklands Development Corporation.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. denied reports Saturday
that it plans to add stories to the Sears Tower because another
Chicago skyscraper might overshadow the world's tallest building.
   The Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Sun-Times reported that
Sears is planning to outdo two Chicago developers who announced
plans in May to erect a taller skyscraper only a few blocks from the
Sears building.
   ``Not to be outdone,'' Friday's Journal said, ``Sears quietly
began drawing up contingency plans to add at least 16 floors to its
tower _ topping the proposed unstart by at least one floor.''
   ``Absolutely not,'' Sears spokesman Doug Fairweather said when
asked if the story was true.
   The Sun-Times reported Saturday that Sears is preparing plans for
an addition, but neither the Sun-Times nor the Journal quoted Sears
officials by name.
   The Sears tower is for sale, and the Journal said the company is
preparing the plans to placate potential buyers who might balk at
the thought of owning the world's second-tallest building.
   Construction would be done by the new owner, the Journal said.
   ``There are no plans, nor has there been any formal study for
such a plan. Not a nickel has been spent,'' Fairweather insisted.

   The Chicago City Council on Friday unanimously
approved a zoning request to allow construction of a 125-story
building, which would be 15 stories higher than the world's tallest.
   The building, proposed by the Chicago real estate development
firm Miglin-Beitler Inc., would rise 1,950 feet, 496 feet taller
than the Sears Tower, currently the world's tallest building.
   The proposed Miglin-Beitler Tower would be in the city's west
Loop area downtown, near the 110-story Sears Tower.
   The council approved the zoning request 44-0, said Alderman
William Banks, chairman of the Committee on Zoning.
   Developer Paul Beitler said the tower's skinny design will cater
to the ``new market of the 1990s'' _ consulting firms, small
corporations and other small tenants who can't afford entire floors
in fatter office buildings.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's new Taj Majal casino in
Atlantic City, with its minarets and huge stone elephants, has left
many here wondering _ or worrying _ what the mega-developer plans
for an encore.
   But details concerning Trump's grand design for the site of the
historic Ambassador Hotel remain by and large the sultan's secret.
   Three months ago, the New York billionaire revealed he had
become a partner in a group that bought the boarded-up hotel with
the intention of razing it and building a new project. The
development at the 24-acre site on Wilshire Boulevard would be
Trump's first in the nation's second-largest city.
   He's hinted that he may try to put up the world's tallest
building, a tower of 125 stories or more, if plans for a similarly
outsized building are thwarted in New York City.
   Such talk has worried environmentalists _ Bob Hattoy of the
Sierra Club quipped that Trump was giving the city an ``edifice
complex'' _ but it remains just talk.
   ``We haven't formally announced anything in terms of how tall or
how wide,'' said Barbara Res, the Trump Organization vice president
who is shepherding the deal.
   Whatever its shape, the $1 billion project would give Los
Angeles something it lacks _ a landmark comparable to the Eiffel
Tower or Rockefeller Center, Res said in a recent telephone
interview.
   ``We anticipate having a major shopping area, a luxury hotel _ a
very large one with a very, very large banquet and ballroom
facility, maybe on the order of 50,000 square feet _ a lot of
office space and a housing element,'' she said.
   The Ambassador was home to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub where
the rich and famous in Southern California came to play, but is
perhaps best known as the place where Robert F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1968. The hotel, its glamour now faded, finally
closed in January 1989.
   With no specifics to react to yet, not even an artist's concept,
the potential opponents of Trump's development are left with little
to say.
   ``There's nothing on the table,'' said Jay Rounds, executive
director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a non-profit historic
preservation group. ``We don't deal in critiques of press
conferences.''
   A spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley, reflecting the views of
several local politicians, said, ``We need to wait until we see
specifics of the project before we can discuss it in detail.''
   The scarcity of details on design or financing has prompted
speculation that Trump wanted the publicity only to gain leverage
against New York officials who have held up his plans for a
150-story tower on the Hudson River.
   ``Perhaps the fact that I go out to L.A. will change things in
New York,'' Trump told The New York Times in February. He denied
trying to play New York and Los Angeles off against each other, but
added his plans for the world's tallest building ``could go to
either place, and it will only go to one.''
   Could such a building be put up in an earthquake-prone area?
   ``There's no inherent reason why you can't build a building in
the range of 125 stories to be resistant to an earthquake,'' said
Wilford Iwan, a professor of earthquake engineering at the
California Institute of Technology.
   But Iwan added that really big structures ``tend to be quite
flexible,'' and the way such a building would sway in a quake or
strong wind could make people inside feel uncomfortable.
   Another concern is fire, especially since city fire officials
acknowledged that the 1988 inferno in the 62-story First Interstate
tower, then the state's tallest building, came perilously close to
exceeding the metropolitan area's firefighting resources.
   Among those who voice few doubts about Trump's intentions is
Jackie Goldberg, president of the city's Board of Education.
   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which is busing 4,000
Wilshire-area students at a cost of $6 million a year, wants to
take over the property as the site for a desparately needed new
high school. But the board has found itself stymied repeatedly by
the Trump organization, Goldberg said.
   ``We're involved with somebody here who is accustomed to getting
his own way, and has the funds and the lack of public scrutiny to
do it,'' Goldberg fumed.
   When school officials asked the state Allocation Board for $120
million to pay for the land, they discovered that lobbyists hired
by Trump already had persuaded members of the obscure state agency
to withhold the funds.
   The board instead ordered district officials to work out a
compromise with the billionaire developer, whose representatives
offered to find an alternate site for the school.

   A developer wants to turn the Sears Tower into
the world's second-tallest building.
   Miglin-Beitler Developments Inc. announced plans Monday for a
slender, 125-story skyscraper resembling a rocket emerging from the
Loop. The 1,914-foot structure would eclipse by 400 feet the Sears
Tower, the tallest building in the world.
   The developer did not indicate how much the concrete and
steel-reinforced skyscraper would cost.
   Plans for the building have been submitted for approval to the
Chicago Plan Commission.
   Planning Commissioner David Mosena said his first impression is
``it is a handsome building, but I can't take an official position
until we get a chance to study it.''
   Construction could begin by December and could be completed by
mid-1992, the developer said.
   The building, being designed by architect Cesar Pelli, of New
Haven, Conn., would contain 1.2 million square feet of office
space, only about one-third the rentable space of the Sears Tower.

   Big Towers and Dead Birds

<LP>
   New York -- At 5 a.m. one morning last month I accompanied
a small group of New York bird lovers on a gruesome
expedition. Though spring migration was at its height, we
were not heading for budding groves of Central Park's Ramble,
where warblers, thrushes, tanagers and other songbirds of
passage are known to drop in on their way to northern
breeding grounds.
   No, we were heading for the treeless canyons of downtown
and midtown Manhattan. We were looking for birds that had
collided with skyscrapers. Dead birds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Our pre-dawn outing had been organized by Sarah Elliott, a
former children's book editor who now leads bird walks for
the Central Park Conservancy. Ms. Elliott believes that
illuminated tall buildings, "well-lit phallic symbols," in
her words, are deathtraps for passing migratory birds. And so
in the latest issue of the Urban Audubon, a monthly
newsletter of the New York City Audubon Society, she has
launched the Captains for Conservation program. Its purpose:
to inspire "Captains of Industry" who own or run brightly
illuminated skyscrapers to turn off their lights during the
migration seasons. This will save birds. It will save
electricity costs as well and bring companies good publicity.
Ms. Elliott also threatens: "Soon holdouts with flashy
floodlights will look like slobs to the public and their
peers." But she needs evidence -- hence our expedition.
   Richard C. Banks, an ornithologist for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, does not consider skyscrapers to be a
serious threat to birds. "It's more of an emotional thing
than a scientific problem," he says, "connected with people's
concern about the individual bird. As an avian biologist I
tend to worry more about populations, and from that viewpoint
the numbers killed by crashing into tall structures are not
significant."
   An expert on bird collisions with man-made structures
disagrees. Ornithologist Robert Crawford accumulated vast
quantities of data about bird migration by picking up dead
birds daily at the base of a huge TV tower in Leon County,
Fla., as part of a 25-year research project. If the numbers
of transmitters and other tall structures throughout the
country are added up, Mr. Crawford believes, the cumulative
effect on birds is "far from trivial." He estimates that more
than one million birds die annually in collisions with TV
towers alone.
   Mr. Crawford believes that bad weather and bright
illumination can be a deadly combination for migratory birds.
Normally, they zip along at altitudes well above the highest
tower or skyscraper. But they are forced to fly lower when
the skies are overcast. Then rain, mist or fog combine with
lights to disorient and bewilder birds, causing them to
crash. Why, then aren't our city streets littered with dead
birds on rainy days in the spring and fall? Mr. Crawford has
an answer based on his study: Long before dawn, predators
make off with 80% of the downed birds.
   That is why we are here at the plaza of the World Trade
Center at this mind-numbing hour. We want to beat the
sweepers who might whisk away the unsightly little corpses,
or the rats who might make a tasty meal of them before
anybody arrives.
   Our fact-finding mission sets to work. We search the bases
of all buildings, we look in crevices, nooks and crannies.
Starr Saphir, a board member of the New York City Audubon
Society who also leads bird-identifying walks during
migration seasons, suddenly stops and listens. "Over there] I
hear a white-throated sparrow." Sure enough, a small bird
with black-and-white head stripes and a yellow spot above the
bill appears. It is scratching around near a planter. It is,
however, a living bird.
   A subsequent telephone call to Gus Preschle, the general
manager of the World Trade Center, helped to explain the
absence of avian cadavers at New York's tallest skyscraper
complex. "Unlike many other tall buildings," Mr. Preschle
said with a certain smugness, "we have no decorative lighting
on the towers themselves. There are no floodlights on the
building."
   The Empire State Building is a different story. Everybody
knows that this famous skyscraper is lavishly illuminated
with bright lights and colors. And indeed, birds colliding
with the building have made headlines for almost half a
century. "Fog Is Blamed as Birds Die Hitting Empire State
Building. Tiny Bodies Litter 5th Avenue," a front-page
headline proclaimed on September 12, 1948. At least eight
other large bird kills at the Empire State have been reported
over the years.
   Actually, the powers that be at the Empire State Building
are not unconcerned about bird welfare. "We try to avoid any
real trauma to the flock," says Charles Giuno, head of
operations. "On nights when the atmospheric conditions would
cause them confusion, we turn off the floodlights and the
vertical and horizontal fluorescent lights. The decision is
made on a day-to-day basis. If the guard at the observatory
sees any birds flying around the lights, he is instructed to
notify the engineer. The engineer then turns off the lights."
   This information does not mollify Ms. Elliott. She happens
to live just three blocks east, and she says she has observed
the tower lights on even in bad weather. This is why our
group now makes its way to 33rd Street and Park Avenue. Since
the small migrants would likely be coming from the South, we
would find any dead birds on the south side of the great
skyscraper.
   It is almost 6 a.m. by now. We do not find any dead birds.
But we do encounter a porter sweeping directly across the
street. Angel Roman is his name and he has worked at 10 West
33rd St. for 11 years. A couple of years ago, around midnight
on a foggy night, he looked up and saw an amazing sight:
"Thousands of birds. Just going round and round and round in
the lights on top of the Empire State Building," he related.
The next morning, he said, he found many dead birds on the
sidewalk, and a few that were lying there, stunned but alive.
   "Aha]" said Ms. Elliott triumphantly.
   Our last inspection site was the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Building, a tall landmark on 23rd Street and
Madison that is "lit up like a birthday cake," as Ms. Elliott
described it. "It is to lights what boom boxes are to music,"
she added. Across the street from our target building is
Madison Square Park, a small, leafy oasis. "A wave of
warblers may have arrived last night," said Ms. Saphir. "I
hear an oven bird and a black-throated blue."
   It was almost daybreak as we approached the entrance of
the Met Life building. And there we saw it, a soft, velvety
bird about five inches long with a rich yellow throat and a
dramatic black mask across its eyes. It was lying motionless
on the sidewalk: a male common yellowthroat, a warbler more
at home in moist thickets and low underbrush than on a city
pavement, a bird whose piercing song ("witchety, witchety,
witchety]") is one of the loudest in the warbler kingdom.
"Poor bird," said Ms. Elliott in a low voice as she stooped
to inspect it. At that moment the bird flew off, somewhat
shakily, across the street into the park.
   Our emotion: relief. Our tally: no dead birds, one dazed
survivor. But the fact-finding committee had found a fact and
Ms. Elliott was gratified. "We do know that bright lights put
birds at risk, and that's enough. People can destroy, but
they can't replace what they destroy. If birds go, all goes."
   Note: If you are a Captain of Industry and wish to become
a Captain for Conservation, you may write Sarah Elliott at
333 East 34 St., New York, N.Y. 10016.

<HEAD>Company Designs 500-Story Building, But No Plans to Build It</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction company said Thursday it has
designed a 500-story skyscraper for Tokyo, although there are no
immediate plans to build it.
   The designers would need 25 years and $326.2 billion to build
the 6,669-foot-tall ``Aeropolis 2001,'' said Yasuyuki Kimura, a
spokesman for Ohbayashi Corp.
   This includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56-square-mile
island in Tokyo Bay, he added.
   The project was made possible by Japan's advanced techniques to
protect buildings in earthquakes, he said.
   The tallest building in earthquake-prone Japan is the 60-story
Sunshine City Building in Tokyo. The 110-story Sears Tower in
Chicago is the world's tallest building.
   Yukihisa Tokunaga, a city planning official of the Construction
Ministry, said the 500-story building is one of a number of private
plans by major construction firms to meet Tokyo's growing need for
office and apartment space.
   ``I understand that none of the plans, including what they call
`Waterfronts,' `Geofronts,' `Undergroundpolis' and `Aeropolis,' has
been submitted for any government approval,'' Tokunaga said.
   The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000
people. Aside from office space and residential units, it also

A construction company said Thursday that it has designed a 500-story 
skyscraper for Tokyo, although there are no immediate plans to build it. 
</P>
<P>
The designers would need 25 years and $326.2 billion to build the 
6,669-foot-tall "Aeropolis 2001," said Yasuyuki Kimura, a spokesman for 
Ohbayashi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
This includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56-square-mile island in Tokyo 
Bay, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The project was made possible by Japan's advanced techniques to protect 
buildings in earthquakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tallest building in earthquake-prone Japan is Tokyo's 60-story Sunshine 
City Building. The 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago is the world's tallest 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Yukihisa Tokunaga, a city planning official of the Construction Ministry, said 
the 500-story building is one of a number of private plans by major 
construction firms to meet Tokyo's growing need for office and apartment space. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000 people. Aside from 
office space and residential units, it also would have space for hotels, 
hospitals, parks and convention centers. 
</P>
<P>
The design envisions elevators that would reach the top floor in 15 minutes.

SELIG UNDAUNTED AFTER SELLING HIS SEATTLE SKYSCRAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DIETRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When maverick Seattle skyscraper developer Martin Selig fell behind on his 
light bill last winter, his competitors figured that he might be in trouble. 
And when nearly $1 million in mortgage checks on five of his buildings bounced 
this summer, they were pretty well convinced. 
</P>
<P>
But by mid-October, Selig was back in the black, although he was no longer 
literally on top of this city's hot commercial real estate market. He solved 
his cash problems by agreeing to sell Seattle's tallest building, the 76-story 
Columbia Seafirst Center, for $354 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was the latest twist in the unlikely saga of a controversial 
52-year-old businessman who started with nothing and who remains, even after 
the deal, Seattle's biggest property holder. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the skyscraper to tenant Seafirst Corp., a subsidiary of 
BankAmerica Corp., was the biggest real estate sale in Washington state 
history. The 986-foot building was the tallest on the West Coast when it was 
completed in 1985, although the First Interstate Tower in Los Angeles later 
topped it by 73 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Selig's practiced positivism was in full bloom after the sale. "The sale of 
this building is not a setback, it is a phenomenal victory," he proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he reasoned, the sale price is $102 million more than the mortgage 
he holds. Just starting construction of the 1.5-million-square foot building in 
a city Seattle's size was "a significant risk," Selig said, and now it must be 
viewed as a winning gamble. 
</P>
<P>
But the necessity of selling, caused by depressed rents from a temporary glut 
of new skyscrapers, has to hurt. Selig once called the 10-year process to plan, 
build and fill the tower "an Olympian feat." 
</P>
<P>
"The Space Needle told people where Seattle was," he once remarked. "Columbia 
Center tells people Seattle has arrived." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is another building of this size in the world owned by an 
individual," Selig boasted when the tower was completed. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of new buildings from competitors forced Selig to keep his rents down 
at Columbia Center and at his other buildings, and postpone his bills. At one 
point he owed $640,000 to Seattle City Light for electricity, since paid. 
</P>
<P>
Both Selig and his skyscraper remain controversial. Critics have charged that 
the black-glass, curved edifice is out of scale with Seattle and that several 
other Selig buildings are too derivative of Houston-style architecture. The 
tower and the swank private club that Selig installed at the top was a project 
driven by ego instead of civic need, they sniped. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen activists who preferred the days when the horizon was dominated by 
Mount Rainier launched a campaign that resulted in new city zoning that makes 
it impossible to build a skyscraper as high as Columbia Center again. This 
year, voters also approved a lid on future downtown office construction. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasts, however, think that the spire nicely punctuates a newly cocky 
skyline in a city trying to cash in on Pacific Rim trade. 
</P>
<P>
Selig, an avid collector of modern art, said of his buildings: "You have to 
look at them as sculptures." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity," Selig said of the building code in force in the late 
1970s. "I wanted to build the maximum building I could build at that time." 
</P>
<P>
The present cap, he said, could make existing buildings more valuable but may 
hurt future downtown growth. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the skyscraper has also provoked controversy. It was assessed for 
tax purposes at only $195 million. The big price tag in Seattle's hot real 
estate market has prompted county officials to propose recalculating 
assessments of all commercial and residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
Turmoil is nothing new to Selig. He and his parents emigrated to the United 
States in 1940 as Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, when he was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
His drive was apparent early. Shortly before the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, he 
gave construction workers some Space Needle sweat shirts that he was hawking in 
return for a ride to the top of the new landmark. And he bought his first 
commercial property while a student at the University of Washington. He 
borrowed part of the down payment and sold the property a year later for a good 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
With aggressive borrowing, attention to construction details and personal 
service to tenants, he has averaged about one new building per year since the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a local empire of big office buildings that he puts in "the high 
20s" with an assessed value of more than half a billion dollars. Observers 
believe that the true market value of his holdings is at least 50% higher. 
</P>
<P>
But while immensely successful, Selig has remained somewhat aloof from 
Seattle's clubby establishment. He keeps a low profile on most civic issues, 
will not discuss his personal life with the media (he is married with two 
children) and is reluctant to talk about what makes him tick. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he concentrates on making Seattle's profile higher with buildings. "I 
love Seattle and am pleased to be able to play such an active role in its 
evolution," he said in a statement issued with the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for additional Selig buildings of 10, 19 and 36 stories. 
"We absolutely are still here," he said.

<LEADPARA>  Good news to some; bad news for others. It depends on your point of view.;   
Those two planned 12-story towers in central Fremont billed as the future
downtown "focus" are just about ready for construction. The first tower should
rise on former ranch land at the corner of California Street and Walnut Avenue
later this year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "You should see activity there in March and ground-breaking in mid-April,"
said Monty Goodell, general partner of One Pacific Plaza.;    But this complex
with its 12-story towers -- the tallest buildings in Fremont -- will cut off
the view of the eastern  hills for the folks in our third floor MercNews
office across California Street. Some people are really steamed.;    "They'll
never build that in our lifetime," said one reporter.;    But progress marches
on.;    The four-acre $72 to $75 million project was approved by the Fremont
City Council three years ago. It has taken that long to line up the finances
and attract prospective tenants.;    Goodell said that construction will be
done in two stages. The first, which will cost about $40 million, will bring
Fremont one 12-story building with two levels of upscale shopping. Goodell
likened the planned development to the Embarcadero shopping center in San
Francisco. The second stage will be the second tower which will be either for
offices or for a hotel, depending on the market in two years. Two restaurants
are also planned.;    "We're getting a lot of calls from hotels," Goodell 
said. Interest is also high in the retail shops and view office space. He said
that 50 percent of the tenants are lined up for phase one.;    Goodell said
that the first stage of construction will require the removal of the top 12
feet of earth to make way for the underground garage. Goodell is talking with
a highway builder who can use some dirt for fill.;    Partners Goodell, his
cousin Ralph Goodell, who is the architect, and investor Sam Fung bought out
Mash Khan, who was the original developer on the project.;    Other financing
is coming through a Los Angeles-based investment fund, Goodell said.;    It's
probably too late for us to get our money in.;    "We don't need investors
anymore," Goodell said.;    But if you want to see the great view from the
MercNews, y'all come over. But do it before mid-April.; HIGH IN FREMONT: Tall
buildings make some people nervous. Others complain that because they are so
tall they are out of place. So-o-o-o, while the 1986 architects' drawing for
One Pacific Plaza is viewed from eye level showing very tall buildings, the
1991 updated drawings give you the view a passing hawk might have. The result:
12 stories looks less imposing.; NAMES, NAMES, NAMES: Fremont's M.C. Hammer is
a Grammy nominee for his "U Can't Touch This." The 33rd annual award show will
be telecast from New York City's Radio City Music Hall Feb. 20 on CBS . . .
They are bragging about 4th grader Ria Denise Quiazon over at Pioneer
Elementary in Union City. Ria was among the 100 finalists chosen from 250,000
students across the country who entered books in the 1990 contest sponsored by
the Landmark Editions, Inc. publishing house of Kansas City, Mo. She received
an Award for Achievement certificate for her effort. Ria's book in entitled
"The Impossible Dream."  Helping her with it were her 3rd grade teacher Cathy
Schoon and Janice Gill, a librarian at Pioneer. Ria said she plans to do
another book this year.; DEADLINE TODAY: Today is the deadline for
reservations for the Jan. 20 third annual Human Services Awards Program
sponsored by the Fremont Human Relations Commission and the United Way. The
program is from noon to 4 p.m. at Choices, 5399 Farwell Place. Awards are
given to people or groups who have contributed in the categories of community
action, human services, Intercultural affairs and humanitarian endeavors.
Tickets are $25. To make reservations or to get more information, call Fern

<TEXT>
   In Manhattan, where even the air is for sale,
developers are wheeling and dealing to keep building higher and
denser on an island that isn't getting any bigger.
   Donald Trump wants to use the rights he owns to land under the
Hudson River to create the world's tallest building. Across town,
the owner of the air space above Grand Central Terminal has been
battling for more than 11 years to convert it to glass, steel, and
cash on the ground.
   ``It's a logical extension of the cleverness of New York City
developers' lawyers,'' says Steve Robinson, co-chairman of
Westpride, a community organization fighting excessive development.
``They push the limits, they invent new mechanisms, they try
anything that may have a shot at working, because there are so many
dollars at stake.''
   Dozens of office and apartment buildings are going up in New
York's midtown area alone, especially around Times Square.
   Under the city's complex zoning laws, the sale of air rights has
become commonplace. It works this way: An investor owns, say, a
five-story building in an area where 10-story buildings are allowed.
He or she ``sells'' the unused air space to a neighbor, who then
gets the right to build a 15-story building. With air rights
purchases and other maneuvers, such as offering to build public
plazas or low-cost housing in exchange for waiver of size
restrictions, developers have managed to put up bigger buildings
than the zoning law would otherwise allow. But such actions have
raised cries of foul.
   ``On street corners all over Manhattan ... you have
disproportionately large buildings going up,'' said Sandor E. Katz
of the Women's City Club of New York, a civic organization. ``There
needs to be some absolute limit on the amount of additional floor
area that can be imposed on any one lot.''
   Civic groups are focusing on Trump City, the billionaire
developer's massive West Side project. Katz calls it ``the most
dramatic single example of the kind of monstrous result you can get
by the accumulation of development rights.''
   Westpride targeted it from early on.
   ``If we are able to have an impact on what Trump proposes, then
other developers in the city would begin to get the signal,'' says
Robinson.
   On 76 acres of old railroad yards along the Hudson River between
59th and 72nd streets, the largest undeveloped land parcel in the
city, Trump City would include a 150-story structure and 13 other
buildings ranging from 13 to 60 floors. Besides offices, hotel space
and apartments, there would be an 800,000-square-foot shopping mall.
   Westpride says the 7,600 housing units would heavily overburden
the neighborhood's schools and sewers, and that the tower, the
world's tallest, would cast a shadow across the Hudson River and
Central Park. Trump's people say there are plenty of sewers and
schools, and that the shadow would not be that obtrusive in a city
full of skyscrapers.
   Trump wants to transfer to his shoreline property the development
rights he owns to 19 acres under the Hudson River, a holdover from
the days when waterfront industry extended onto the piers.
   William Valletta, counsel to the Department of City Planning,
said that the city's zoning law allows a lot's overall size _
including underwater rights _ to be the basis for determining the
size limits of a building. Zoning reformers want to get rid of that
provision.
   Trump hopes to start building in mid-1990.
   On the East Side, developers are hoping to use the air rights
created by the space above the Grand Central commuter train terminal
to build the city's fourth-largest skyscraper nearby.
   In 1978, the Supreme Court backed the city in blocking Grand
Central's owner, the Penn Central Corp., from building a 53-story
office tower atop the landmark train station.
   But the court said it might reconsider if Penn Central found it
couldn't use the leftover development rights on the station site or
get compensation by transferring them, according to a Penn Central
attorney.
   In 1983, Penn Central contracted to sell up to 1.5 million square
feet of air rights to 383 Madison Associates, which wants to use
about half of the rights for a 74-story building at its address
several blocks away.
   The zoning law allows such transfers from a landmark to an
adjacent lot. Penn Central owns the underground land, used for train
tracks, between the terminal and 383 Madison, and it and the
developers hope the rights to this land will qualify the properties
as adjacent, thus facilitating the transfer.
   The local community board rejected the 383 Madison Ave. proposal
in June, but it could be overturned by the city Planning Commission,
which is voting on the plan this week.

TOWERING AMBITIONS;

<P>
CITY'S SEARCH FOR AN IMAGE IS LOOKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A downtown in search of a more fashionable face can look out at the world with 
a new hauteur today, as the sleek, pale contours of a new and conspicuously 
different skyscraper rise in cool contrast to the city's bulky skyline. 
</P>
<P>
This horizontal city, where buildings over 13 stories were prohibited until 
1957, has become home to the tallest building on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-story tower is the work of I.M. Pei &amp; Partners and is one of a score 
of giant office buildings being shaped for Los Angeles by well-known 
architects, including Michael Graves, Cesar Pelli, Arthur Erickson, Helmut Jahn 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
The new crop of designer skyscrapers is part of a bid for visual distinction 
that has long eluded downtown Los Angeles. Flush with foreign money and eager 
for the world's approval, the city is anxious to shed any traces of 
provincialism. At the same time, the city is hoping to create a landscape in 
which a lot more people will want to live. With less than 2% of the people who 
work downtown living there, habitability has become a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
Take care of the problem, and local leaders believe they can realize their goal 
of a downtown with nearly twice its current working population of 276,000 and 
twice the commercial space of downtown San Francisco. (Los Angeles now has 
slightly less than San Francisco.) With office growth averaging about 1 million 
square feet a year and the occupancy rate running about 80%, the boosters' 
dream of a skyline that stretches from Union Station to USC may not be all that 
fanciful. 
</P>
<P>
In the works for nearly 10 years, the tower points to the city's growing 
preoccupation with its image and its confusion over what the image ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are those who say the city needs a majestic skyline, like New York 
or Chicago, if it is going to be recognized as a world capital. California 
historian Kevin Starr said recently that one reason Los Angeles has not been 
taken as seriously as other cities its size is because its large buildings are 
not especially impressive. Starr suggested that a city better known for zany 
architecture -- the original Brown Derby restaurant shaped like a hat, 
Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Tail of the Pup hot dog stand -- could do with a 
make-over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Dubiousness 
</P>
<P>
But there are also people who say that the rush to build modish skyscrapers, 
like Pei's tower, will superimpose an anonymous big-city look on a town famous 
for the personality of its smaller buildings. Critics wonder why a Western city 
with a long legacy of original architecture should look eastward for its 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Pei's architects said that as they worked on plans for the new tower, they 
looked east and west, at buildings rich in classical ornamentation and at those 
with very little detailing. The architects said they hung up pictures of the 
Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. But they said they also paid 
close attention to the Central Library -- "a strong, spare building, very 
authoritative and very Western," in the words of Henry N. Cobb, the architect 
in Pei's firm most responsible for designing the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb and his colleagues said they wanted to put up a building that was both 
showy and self-effacing. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a building that was more spirited than many big buildings 
downtown, but one that did not threaten the primacy of the library," Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Cobb set out to build the tallest building west of Houston, a 
$350-million skyscraper standing a fifth of a mile high, that would not 
overshadow the three-story structure across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb has reason to be sensitive about the library. Few buildings in Los Angeles 
have so endeared themselves to the public. The preservation of the library has 
been a cause celebre for at least 25 years. Moreover, its fate and that of the 
tower are closely linked. Approval of the tower was contingent on a commitment 
by the developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, to underwrite $110 million of the 
cost of preserving and expanding the library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on the Ground 
</P>
<P>
As the tower has risen to its full height, it has become clear that its success 
will be gauged as much by the way it meets the ground around it as how it 
greets the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is going to be judged on how it enhances the environment around 
it as opposed to how it shows off at the top. The top 60 feet belongs to a few 
people. The bottom 60 feet belongs to everyone," said Richard Weinstein, dean 
of the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Design. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at the bottom that the building will achieve its uniqueness, if it is 
going to, in its response to the weather, to the street-scape, to the library . 
. . to those things that are distinctly Los Angeles," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the tower and a 54-story neighbor that also is a Maguire Thomas 
project will bring 8,000 to 10,000 people, about 2,000 cars, and more than 3 
million square feet of development to the three-block neighborhood now known as 
Library Square. Most of the people who will work there are part of the city's 
expanding financial service sector. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no public viewing deck at the top of the tower. The bottom is 
where the developers will try to please the public. There, they have taken on 
the daunting challenge of trying to provide downtown Los Angeles with a popular 
outdoor gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a colorful street-scape where people of all walks of life mix easily 
and often, where there is a little fun in the air, has proved to be one of the 
more elusive goals for planners and developers who want to make the downtown an 
enjoyable place to work and live. 
</P>
<P>
In Weinstein's words, the downtown badly needs "an extraordinary public place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking a Location 
</P>
<P>
If one can be created, Library Square would be an appropriate spot. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting on 5th Street between Flower and Grand, the new tower perches on a 
50-foot rise that symbolizes a cultural divide between the granite and glass 
canyons of the Bunker Hill Financial District and the lower downtown, a seedier 
if livelier place, that stretches north from the apparel and jewelry marts to 
Broadway, Skid Row and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to Maguire Thomas and their architects is to create a link 
between the two sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have responded with the kind of exotic gesture one might have 
expected of Los Angeles in an earlier time, when the city dreamed of itself as 
a Mediterranean oasis, created its own Venice and built houses to look like 
Moorish palaces. 
</P>
<P>
Library Square looks to Rome for its inspiration. A lavish outdoor stairway 
meant to recall Rome's Spanish Steps will wend its way 50 feet down from the 
top of the hill, around the curved base of the tower to 5th Street and a 
walkway leading to the library's west lawn. According to designer Lawrence 
Halprin, cafes and kiosks will border one side of the stairway, which will be 
broken into a series of terraces with places to sit and eat. 
</P>
<P>
The steps, which won't be finished for several months, are based on one of the 
most striking architectural elements in Rome and one of that city's most 
romantic settings. In Los Angeles, unlike Rome, the steps will be notched 
between two giant buildings, the new tower and an existing high-rise office 
building next door. This being a modern city, the steps will be flanked by 
escalators. And, here, the steps will end rather abruptly against a busy 
thoroughfare, something that the Spanish Steps, descending into a long piazza, 
don't have to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
Halprin's plan has generated excitement downtown and a bit of grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Too baroque, too grandiose, too voluptuous, entirely too much going on," said 
Merry Norris, who chairs the city's Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Topping It Off 
</P>
<P>
As Pei's staff prepares to complete the new tower with its illuminated crown, 
they too say the bottom of the building is the most important part of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The base will be considered the most notable aspect of the building when the 
whole thing is done," Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring not just to the steps but to his own efforts at the foot of 
the tower. Cobb said he wanted to get away from the fortress facades typical of 
many big buildings downtown and to avoid "a confrontational stance" toward the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a building that came to the street facing several directions, and 
not staring stiffly in a flat-faced way that would challenge the primacy of the 
library," Cobb said. At the same time, he said, he did not want a round 
building. "Round buildings are self-centered. We were not interested in being 
the center of everything. We were trying to make a welcoming gesture." 
</P>
<P>
The shape that evolved is an interlocking series of planes and curves. From its 
glass crown, the building steps down, its competing geometries facing off at 
corners, terraces and ledges. At the base, the tower's granite finish gives way 
to colonnades of glass that Cobb hopes will create a feeling of transparency 
and openness. 
</P>
<P>
As critics and other architects watch the tower take shape, they say the 
business community is getting what it wanted, a thoughtfully conceived, sleekly 
tailored contemporary skyscraper with an aura of the past about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a late-modern office tower that recalls the romantic era of American 
skyscraper building," said John Kaliski, principal architect for the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling Hopes 
</P>
<P>
The building may also turn out to be the pacesetter that people hoped it would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpted facades and classical allusions evident in the plans of a dozen or 
more office buildings, now in the works, suggest that the skyline will be more 
varied than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt at all that the design stakes have been raised," Kaliski 
said. "L.A. is going to have a skyline as up to date as anywhere in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
But there is also the sense that the tower would fit in comfortably elsewhere, 
and that despite Cobb's sensitivity to the library he did not root his building 
in the culture of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much a modern American office building that could exist in many 
other cities," said Richard Keating, a Los Angeles architect who is designing 
the second building for Maguire Thomas at Library Square. The building will 
front on 5th Street just east of the new tower. Keating said his building will 
complement the tower. "We're not breaking new ground either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tower is a serious building. There are no exotic allusions, nothing to 
suggest the freewheeling, fanciful style of many buildings here. Even the 
63-year-old library, with its Egyptian ornamentation and Beaux Art details, 
reflects a bit of the exuberance of Los Angeles in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the tower) is a very sober building, one that avoids any element of the 
irony you see in a lot of buildings these days," Kaliski said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Matter of Taste 
</P>
<P>
"Cobb is an architect in a gray flannel suit. You don't expect his buildings to 
scream out at you. What you can expect is elegant, tasteful and careful 
design," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
It can be argued that Los Angeles' best architecture is mostly low-lying, in 
homes, stores and public buildings that aren't good models for designing 
skyscrapers. Moreover, Los Angeles has no high-rise base to build on. There is 
very little variety to big buildings downtown partly because of a fear of 
earthquakes that had led to the ban on tall buildings. (An exception was made 
for City Hall.) 
</P>
<P>
The tower at Library Square marks only the second generation of tall buildings 
here, perhaps a little early to be demanding originality. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just beginning," Keating said.

<HL> REAL ESTATE:
Besides Penney, What Else Is
In Store for Dallas Market?

   AMERICAN AIRLINES INC.'S move to the Dallas area in 1979 helped touch off a local real-estate boom. 
Now, the planned relocation to Dallas next spring by J.C. Penney Co. has people in the area hoping for a repeat. 

   Two other big corporations, a retailer and an industrial concern, are looking hard at the city. 
So is the American Cancer Society, which needs a new headquarters site. 
And the Japanese are in town, far afield from their usual real-estate hunting grounds on the East and West coasts. 

   C. Itoh &amp; Co. of Tokyo recently acquired half of the Chateau Plaza office building. 
Several Japanese have acquired land in the city, and Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., Japan's second-largest insurer, quietly agreed last month with Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc. to jointly provide a $450 million convertible mortgage to the Dallas Market Center. 

   But there's certainly no real-estate boom just around the corner for Dallas. 
No one expects the market to recover from its deep slump before 1989, and many say 1989 is too optimistic a timetable. 
The office-vacancy rate is a flabby 26%. 
The city has 35 million square feet of empty space, more than all the office space in downtown Los Angeles. 
And, as federal regulators continue to put pressure on thrifts with shaky portfolios, more depressed properties are likely to be dumped on the market. 

   DESPITE ALL THAT, some people say that Dallas may be one of the first Sun Belt cities to emerge from the current slump. 
Michael Richwine, vice president of institutional real-estate services for Coldwell Banker, says, "Dallas is in better shape than most of the cities in the Southwest." 

   Mr. Richwine and others note that the Dallas economy is more diversified than other cities in the region. 
While the Houston market crashed with oil, the Dallas office glut was caused by overbuilding. 
"We developed the mentality that real estate was a basic industry," says Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Enterprising at Southern Methodist University. 
Offices were built because money was there to finance them, rather than to meet demand. 

   But demand is catching up, at least with new construction. 
The Dallas economy is absorbing five million square feet a year, about what's now coming on the market, and building is on the decline. 
And unlike Houston, Dallas should have 30,000 or so newcomers moving into the city this year, aiding real-estate demand. 
"If you look at the fundamentals, it's clear that the space will be absorbed over the next three to five years," Mr. Weinstein says of the city's empty offices. 

   Some buildings are so poorly located that they may not last that long. 
"We have some buildings that may never lease; some tear-downs," says Jay Dee Allen, who oversees the Southwestern and Mountain states for Cushman &amp; Wakefield. 
But overall, he says, "the climate is better than for any of the cities" in his turf.

   'The Tallest Building West of Chicago' 

   Maguire Thomas Partners is known for classy architecture and imaginative, people-oriented buildings. 
So it seemed a bit out of character when the Santa Monica, Calif., office developer announced the ground-breaking for "the tallest building west of Chicago" -- Library Tower in Los Angeles. 

   In fact, Robert F. Maguire III, the company's founder and co-managing partner, was as surprised as anyone by Library Tower. 
"It turns out to be the tallest building in the West, but we didn't know that," he says. 
"There is a building in Seattle that is 76 stories. 
We always figured that was the biggest." 

   Library Tower will be 73 stories of pale, pink marble. 
But I.M. Pei &amp; Partners, the architect, recently discovered that at 1,017 feet, it will be 75 feet taller than Seattle's Columbia Center. 

   "We were absolutely not interested in having the tallest building," Mr. Maguire says. 
"It's not our style." 

   But economics took over. 
For the $350 million building to be profitable, Maguire Thomas figured it would need 1.3 million rentable square feet. 
I.M. Pei came up with a slender, stepped-back design. 
"We made some efforts to reduce the height," Mr. Maguire says, "but when we did that, it got squatty. 
It wrecked the form." 

   THE BUILDING is part of a plan to save the downtown Los Angeles library, which faces the project site and is one of the few noteworthy historic buildings in the city. 
Built in 1926, the library has been damaged by fires and neglected. 

   In return for the air rights to Library Tower and another building, Maguire Thomas has agreed to $125 million in cash and inkind improvements to rehabilitate and expand the library and to spruce up the nearby area. 

   The tower project, seven years in planning, was on hold while the developer looked for tenants. 
But recently, Arthur Andersen & Co.; Latham &amp; Watkins, a Los Angeles law firm, and Pacific Lighting Corp. signed on for half the space. 
Pacific Lighting also will be a 50-50 partner with Maguire Thomas in the venture. 

   One local mortgage banker says the developer "gave away the store to get those tenants." 
Mr. Maguire concedes that they did get attractive deals, but he says the rest of the building -- due to open in late 1989 -- should lease at above-market rents. 
Robert Ortiz, an official of Cushman Realty Co., agrees. 
"Every tenant we represent wants to look at Library Tower," he says.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Architecture: Helmut Jahn Takes On the Big Apple </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ellen Posner </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This spring, as the last panels of reflective glass and the last wafers of stone are installed on five enormous, weirdly shaped skyscrapers on five sensitive strategic Manhattan sites, Helmut Jahn will have put his mark on this city, much as he already has on the city of Chicago. 

   Located, respectively, next to City Center; across the street from the Chrysler Building; on 59th Street and Lexington Avenue; on 55th Street between Park and Madison avenues; and on 85th Street and Second Avenue (the America), these buildings add up to a hefty string of commissions for the 48-year-old German-born, Chicago-based architect, whose chronological peers, if they have any opportunity to work here at all, often are still settling for additions and renovations. 

   The bigger projects have been easier to come by in recent years, though, if an architect could demonstrate willingness (in this case, eagerness) to provide the maximum superficial splash for the fewest possible dollars, thereby endearing himself to real estate developers who are looking for an edge in a competitive market. 

   And Mr. Jahn's position is as follows: "Everyone today wants a signature building and you have to give the client what he wants. 
Sooner or later he reminds you that he is paying for it." (In other professions, of course, this abnegation of responsibility and expertise might be looked at askance.) 
Mr. Jahn does acknowledge that a city of nothing but "visible pretentious 'foreground' buildings" would be preposterous and "untenable." 
But he clearly believes that those other buildings, the ones that sit gracefully in their environments and that contribute to the fabric of the city, should be designed by someone else. 

   The curvy, cloudlike forms ("a subconscious preference") that Mr. Jahn employs; his slightly off-register palette of pastels, sometimes mixed with black; the combinations of disparate shapes that are given sudden torques, slants and chamfers; and the blown-up proportions that dwarf human beings, are surprising coming from a man who studied in Munich at a time when, as he tells it, the refined, minimalist, but materially rich aesthetic of Mies van der Rohe was "the gospel." 
And Mr. Jahn was a believer. 

   In fact he first came to the U.S. in the late '60s to attend Illinois Institute of Technology, which Mies had designed, where his reign had been absolute, and where his disciples continued to spread the word. 
Mr. Jahn's early work also was not unaffected by Miesian principles. 

   It wasn't very long, however, before the young architect began evolving his own "look" -- one which was not entirely out of keeping with the emerging cynicism and greed of the times: It involved effect for the sake of effect, the glorification of surfaces and exaggeration of technology. 
And eventually Mr. Jahn's unofficial emblem became the tall building wrapped in a taut, shimmery cellophanelike skin. 

   With its large stock of sober, muscular buildings, Chicago has been able to absorb Mr. Jahn's work; there, Xerox Centre's sweeping curve of white metal and reflective glass, or One South Wacker's long grids of pale pink and pale blue glass can seem like light relief. (For similar reasons, his recent Chryslerlike blue-glass tower can be accommodated in downtown Philadelphia). 
New York, on the other hand, already has plenty of fantasy and excess. 
And buildings such as Mr. Jahn's pink-granite-striped Park Avenue Tower on East 55th Street, which rises massively from the ground and sends arms of its facade out to wrap themselves against the sides of adjacent buildings and to claim the street from pedestrians, or the Lexington Avenue and 43rd Street building that splays and becomes wider at its top (described by the architect, with a straight face, as a gesture to the beautiful neighboring Chrysler Building) just seem antiurban and even scary. 

   And there are some other reasons for concern about Mr. Jahn's work. 
His first attributed building was a sports arena in Kansas City, Mo., the roof of which collapsed. 
A year after his wild, dizzying, circular State of Illinois Building opened in Chicago in 1985, the State of Illinois announced that it was initiating a lawsuit against Mr. Jahn's firm and its joint venture partners: It seems that the structure turned out to be difficult to heat in winter and nearly uninhabitably hot in summer. 
The magazine Progressive Architecture reported recently that Mr. Jahn's glassy, vaulted new terminal at O'Hare Airport had some glare problems inside and out -- the latter affecting the work of the facility's air traffic controllers. 
So when Mr. Jahn brags that he successfully fought against Chicago's fire codes so he could build his design of exposed steel supports, one starts to think about changing planes somewhere else. 

   Worse, the forces behind Helmut Jahn's endeavors in this city tend to be powerful. 
One can only guess, for example, why the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which has been known to drive small property owners crazy over a doorknob and that has been holding the line against Michael Graves's (problematic but at least thoughtful) extension to the Whitney Museum, simply rolled over for Mr. Jahn's ungainly CitySpire tower -- which was destined for a site adjacent to the landmark City Center -- and granted that design its never more hilariously named Certificate of Appropriateness. 

   It is interesting to speculate, too, about the acquiescence of the City Planning Department. 
There was, what one staff member describes as an "excruciating" process of determining "to a matter of inches" just how tall CitySpire could be (the calculations were based upon zoning regulations as well as upon allowances made in exchange for the developer's purchase of City Center's air rights and his promise to rehabilitate the theater within the landmark structure). 
And there was a formal ruling by the City Planning Commission. 
Afterward, however, someone on the architect's side discovered that thicker floor slabs were going to be necessary. 

   Thicker slabs, of course, meant a taller building -- that is, unless a floor was eliminated or some floor-to-ceiling height sacrificed. 
The building was built taller; the Landmarks Preservation Commission applied to the City Planning Commission on behalf of the developer for retroactive approval. 
The application was refused. 

   There was lots of outrage about the violation and talk about penalties, law enforcement and having the top 11 or 12 feet of CitySpire torn down. 
But in the face of a lawsuit brought by the developer against the city, the City Planning Department and the city's corporation counsel suddenly determined that a deal could be struck, which would make retroactive approval possible. 

   CitySpire now rises blank, wide and broad-shouldered to what will be its puny dome (according to the architect, this form has something to do with the powerful dome atop City Center). 
Hawked on television by none other than Robin Leach, with print ads that promise deliveries from the swank restaurant La Caravelle, the building, nevertheless, sports (what certainly looks like) grudging pennywise ornament and shoddy finishes. 
Its cramped apartments and airless interior spaces are the kind that give living in New York a bad name. 

   Mr. Jahn is now at work on, among other things, the "tallest building in Europe," which will be built in Frankfurt. 
But the moment of the meretricious design may be ending in New York. 

   Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill's new brand of sedate post-modernism, for example, is growing in popularity as a safe choice for bruised real estate developers. 
And some of the more egregious projects -- including Mr. Jahn's "world's tallest building" for Television City -- have been dying quiet deaths. 

   It may not be too late for something to be done about CitySpire. 
Because of the city's back flip, the building will be swept back into the approval process. 
A Certificate of Appropriateness or even a Certificate of Occupancy could be denied -- either of which would set a precedent.

<HEAD>Two Striking New Bank Buildings Speak To Hong Kong's Future</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Hongkong (not Hong Kong) is the spelling used by the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corp.</NOTE>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One building juts up like an abstractly
whittled chopstick. The other looks like a stack of bridges.
   Two new bank buildings in Hong Kong are striking architectural
testimonies to the future beyond the return of the British colony
to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The taller building, recently topped out at 70 stories, will be
completed next spring to house the Hong Kong office of the Bank of
China, the international banking arm of Communist China.
   The fifth tallest building in the world and the tallest in Asia,
it towers above its neighbors as a symbol, some say, of Beijing's
impending dominance of this free-wheeling world trade center.
   Two blocks east is the ultra-modern glass and aluminum main
office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., commonly called
the Hongkong Bank, a publicly held corporation that is the colony's
leading commercial bank. It also has some central-bank functions
and owns subsidiary banks and stock-dealing firms around the world.
   A radical-looking, 52-level structure, the Hongkong Bank
building was completed in 1985 with a whopping 5.227 billion Hong
Kong dollars ($670 million) spent on its construction and
furnishings, the bank says.
   If the powerful corporation, which has offices in over 50
countries, had put its money elsewhere, it probably would have
shaken confidence in Hong Kong's future as a capitalist haven.
   In 1997 China retakes sovereignty over Hong Kong and its 5.5
million people. Under an agreement between Britain and China the
territory is to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and retain its
capitalist system for 50 years, but doubts about whether the
agreement will hold up have led to an increase in emigration and a
general nervousness about the future of capitalism.
   Michael Broadbent, spokesman and external relations manager of
the Hongkong Bank, said the building was put up ``because we needed
a new building, not because of Hong Kong's future.''
   ``But people did say that if the Hongkong Bank is prepared to
spend so much, it must be confident in the future of Hong Kong,''
Broadbent said.
   ``That is perfectly true. We do have confidence in Hong Kong's
future.''
   The Bank of China building, though taller than the Hongkong Bank
headquarters, may end up costing less. The land for the Bank of
China building cost 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($128 million) and
the construction cost is set at 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars.
   Though the two banks compete in some areas, people associated
with the two buildings aren't throwing stones at each other's costs
or architecture. Broadbent, of the Hongkong Bank, said he greatly
admired the Bank of China's new building. Kellogg Wong, associate
partner in the New York-based I.M. Pei architectural firm that
designed the Bank of China building, has been equally gracious in
his praise of the Hongkong Bank building.
   The Hongkong Bank was designed by the British architect Norman
Foster. The building, more than 585 feet high, has such unusual
features as a sun-scoop across the south side to reflect light into
a 170-foot-high interior atrium; bridge-like trusses at five levels
across the width of the building on which the weight is suspended;
a completely open floor plan; 62 escalators, a claimed world record
for one building; and prefabricated modules on the ends of each
floor containing toilet and service facilities.
   The building was planned to be flexible, and staffers say such
costly features as movable floor panels made from the same material
as aircraft flooring have already paid off by making it possible to
move a whole department in a weekend at low cost.
   The Bank of China building, by contrast, surges up from a base
tier 170 feet square and 170 feet tall, making the first tier a
cube. At that level three-quarters of the cube continues to rise,
and at higher tiers the building becomes abruptly narrower up to
the prism-shaped top, 1,220 feet high. Triangular trusses and
upward-pointing angles are the main visible features.
   ``It's not surprising that the building makes a very strong
structural statement,'' said Wong.
   Leslie Robertson, head of a New York structural engineering firm
that now counts the Bank of China as well as the two World Trade
Center towers in New York among its super-tall clients, said the
building was destined to become ``a new symbol for Hong Kong.''
   But for the Japan-based Kumagai Gumi construction company, which
is doing much of the building work, the Bank of China is likely to
be a money loser.
   By contract the company will receive 1.1 billion Hong Kong
dollars for its work, said Martin Hadaway, project director for
Kumagai Gumi, but costs have escalated above that with the rise in
the Japanese yen and other factors.
   Asked how much Kumagai Gumi would lose, Hadaway replied, ``I
don't know ... But if you take the long-term view, your reputation
in Hong Kong and China will more than cover the loss eventually.''

TRUMP'S PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be spectacular if Donald Trump actually does build the world's tallest 
skyscraper on the Ambassador Hotel property (Part A, Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
At first I agreed with Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that Trump's proposed 
building would be inappropriate and out of scale for that area. 
</P>
<P>
But after thinking about it, it occurs to me that the Eiffel Tower is certainly 
"out of scale" in its Paris neighborhood; the Empire State Building was "out of 
scale" when it was built more than a half century ago, and isn't that Tower in 
Pisa "out of scale"? And weren't these buildings the object of scorn, ridicule 
and opposition when first proposed? Yet, Paris, New York and Pisa just wouldn't 
be the same without them. 
</P>
<P>
The world's tallest building wouldn't be just another office building; it would 
be an attraction for the people of Los Angeles and tourists from around the 
world. That means far more tax dollars and jobs than another Arco twin-tower 
office complex which would contain the same number of square feet of office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that if Trump is serious, Los Angeles should encourage him to build 
our "Eiffel Tower" on Wilshire Boulevard.

its towering headquarters building, analysts say _ if it sells it at
all.
   A no-sale option reportedly is under consideration by the
nation's largest retailer since its prospective sale of Sears Tower
to a Canadian developer got sidetracked last week.
   Sears declined to comment Monday on the report in this week's
Crain's Chicago Business, which did not identify its sources for the
story.
   One option being considered, according to Crain's, was a
refinancing plan that would amount to a new mortgage on the property.
   Among Sears watchers, the item was received as one more rumor
swirling in the wind around the world's tallest building.
   ``I'm convinced the tower is to be sold,'' said Walter Loeb, a
retail analyst who follows Sears for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York. But, he added, ``I think it may be sitting on the shelf a
while longer.''
   Retailing analysts said Sears' investment value would not suffer
if the tower were not sold by year's end, as the company had planned.
   But Sears had planned to use proceeds from the sale to pay off
the money it borrowed for its stock repurchase program.
   And reducing its debt, reported by Sears as $2 billion in a July
31 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, remains a
powerful incentive for Sears to sell its tower, Loeb said.
   Some observers believe Sears could still end up selling the
110-story, 1,707-foot landmark to Olympia &amp; York Developments Inc.,
the Toronto-based company that, until last week, appeared ready to
buy Sears Tower for a widely reported $1.04 billion.
   The prospective sale got stalled in a dispute over which party
should shoulder a steep increase in property taxes likely to result
from a post-sale reassessment.
   Olympia &amp; York declined to comment on the tower sale, or on
whether the firm was backing out in order to devote more resources
to bankrolling the cash-starved Canadian retailer Campeau Corp.
   Olympia &amp; York conditionally agreed Friday to loan Campeau $250
million in a deal that was expected to give the Toronto developer
greater influence over Campeau's management and a greater ownership
stake.
   Sears announced last October it would sell the tower as part of a
restructuring plan that included an everyday low-price retailing
policy, the transfer of its retailing division headquarters from the
tower to suburban Hoffman Estates in the early 1990s, and a buyback
of 40 million shares, or about 10 percent, of its outstanding stock.
   Olympia &amp; York emerged as the leading bidder in July but the
negotiations were rocky. Sears apparently insisted its name remain
on the building after the sale and the Canadians reportedly had
trouble finding a large tenant to anchor the 2 million square feet
of office space Sears is vacating in the 15-year-old building.
   British-based publisher Maxwell Communications Corp. was said to
have been interested in consolidating its Chicago operations in
Sears Tower but is now considering other quarters, including a
125-story skyscraper proposed by local developers Miglin-Beitler
Developments Inc. that would be taller than the Sears Tower.
   ``We submitted a bid (to Maxwell) on Friday,'' said
Miglin-Beitler spokesman Mark Jarasek.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has denied that a Japanese
real estate firm is close to buying the Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building.
   ``We are compiling a financial analysis, which is the first step
in the offering process. We are not involved in any negotiations at
this time,'' Sears said in a statement Wednesday.
   But Jack Barthell, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of
Los Angeles, said his client, a Japanese real estate firm he would
not identify, was nearing a deal to buy the 110-story skyscraper for
about $1.2 billion.
   ``Because of the closeness of the deal, it's very sensitive,''
Barthell said.
   He said only that his owned high-profile buildings in other
cities and already has ``a presence in Chicago.''
   Sears announced Oct. 31 that it would sell the tower as part of a
restructuring plan. The giant retailing-and-financial-services
company has said it intends to keep its corporate headquarters in
the 15-year-old building.
   The tower, which rises 1,450 feet above downtown Chicago, is
expected to fetch a record price for a U.S. building, surpassing the
$660 million paid by Walter Shorenstein in 1985 for the Bank of
America Building in San Francisco.
   The building's value on the open market has been estimated at
$1.2 billion to $2 billion.
   Barthell's description prompted speculation that his client was
Shuwa Corp., a Japanese developer with more than $2 billion in U.S.
holdings, including ABC's New York headquarters, Arco Plaza in Los
Angeles and the Quaker Oats Tower in Chicago.
   But Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman in Los Angeles for Shuwa
Investment Corp., a Shuwa affiliate, said the company was not
negotiating to buy the Sears Tower.

NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
When Laura Benson moved into her ninth-floor apartment on West 57th Street, it 
was a light and airy retreat from the pressures of teeming Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, her building is a dwarf in the shadows of the 
steel-and-glass towers that surround it, and Benson's once-pleasant home seems 
more and more like a cave. She can't even read during the daytime without 
turning on her lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fun to be in the apartment," Benson complained. "I go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
If Los Angeles' struggles with growth are defined by its clogged freeways and 
choking smog, Manhattan's are most evident in its dwindling patches of sunshine 
and open space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosive Growth 
</P>
<P>
New York's strong recovery from its fiscal crisis of the 1970s, combined with 
the explosive growth of the financial services industry, has sent Manhattan 
into one of its most prolonged building booms ever. Demand has driven land 
prices to astronomical levels. Developers have nowhere to go but up: There are 
more than 60 buildings of taller than 15 stories under construction in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Air and light are scarcer than ever, and these days, a host of sophisticated 
and well-organized neighborhood groups are fighting to save what remains. Such 
luminaries as actor Paul Newman, violinist Itzhak Perlman and former First Lady 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have lent their names to the efforts to stop or slow 
various projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 20 years ago, New Yorkers would say, the bigger, the better, because 
that's what distinguishes us," said state Sen. Franz S. Leichter. "Now, there's 
concern for quality of life, and a realization that bigness isn't necessarily 
goodness. . . . Throughout the city, you are finding a revolt against 
developments that do not harmonize with the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beginning of Tragedy' 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone sees it that way. George Sternlieb, head of Rutgers University's 
Center for Urban Policy Research, described the growing influence of 
development opponents as "the beginning of a tragedy. . . . It is a desperate 
rear-guard action against the city of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can remember the bad times, when New York and New Jersey were competing 
to see which would have the highest unemployment rate," Sternlieb said. "When 
we were scared, anybody who wanted to do anything short of a toxic waste 
disposal site was welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "there are literally a thousand groups that have the power to 
naysay." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, such organizations have won two important skirmishes in their 
escalating war with developers. 
</P>
<P>
In late March, Albert and Laurence Ginsberg were ordered to decapitate more 
than one-third of their new 31-story Upper East Side apartment building after a 
neighborhood group, Civitas, discovered they had built it taller than the law 
allows. It was the first time such a dramatic penalty had been levied by the 
city, and will mean the loss of 24 apartments that would have sold for about 
$450,000 each, or a total of $11 million. Demolition and related expenses are 
expected to cost $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Ginsbergs are appealing the Board of Standards and Appeals ruling in court. 
Meanwhile, the nearly complete building sits empty, as it has since early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mortimer B. Zuckerman finally reached an agreement with 
neighborhood groups over the skyscraper he plans to build on Columbus Circle. 
During his four-year battle, he was forced to scale down his plans twice in the 
face of public outcry. At one point, thousands gathered in Central Park with 
umbrellas to demonstrate how much sunlight the building would block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fight Over Trump City 
</P>
<P>
Those fights could pale in comparison to what may await Donald Trump, who 
expects to apply within the next few months for city permission to build his 
colossal Trump City on the Hudson River between 59th and 72nd streets. The site 
of an old Conrail yard, it is Manhattan's largest remaining undeveloped tract. 
</P>
<P>
The showpiece of Trump's 18-million-square-foot development would be the 
world's tallest building -- a 152-story tower of offices, hotel rooms and 
apartments rising a third of a mile from the Hudson's bank. Alongside it would 
be a row of 60-story buildings and the city's largest shopping mall. Its daily 
population of workers, residents and visitors would be around 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Trump insists that the development would not be another concrete wasteland. It 
would include 19 acres of parks and public recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to build a project there that is suitable for the site -- suitably 
grand," said Anthony Gliedman, executive vice president of the Trump 
Organization. "We're committed to doing a really great project there." 
</P>
<P>
Westpride, a 3-year-old community group, does not share Trump's enthusiasm or 
his taste. Trump is "the Liberace of development," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, 
one of Westpride's founders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bizarre. It is the size of a whole new city grafted onto what is already 
one of the densest neighborhoods of New York. It's just idiocy," said Gratz, 
who is the author of a recently published book, "The Living City." 
</P>
<P>
"The future of the West Side is being cemented into place for generations, and 
it is a future that has an appalling lack of concern for human scale, human 
values, for a sense of community," added author Robert A. Caro, a West Side 
resident who chronicled the development of modern New York in his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning biography of legendary city planner Robert Moses. 
</P>
<P>
Westpride has estimated that Trump's tallest building would cast a shadow a 
quarter of a mile into New Jersey in the early morning and almost all the way 
across Manhattan on some spring afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"New York is a city of tall buildings. Clearly, there's nothing particularly 
damaged by (Trump City)," Gliedman replied. "Who would know if it cast a shadow 
to New Jersey? Who would care?" He insisted that the spire would be less 
intrusive to the air and light than the bulky developments of earlier eras, 
such as Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, tall buildings are nothing new to Manhattan. As far back as 1930, 
folk singer Woody Guthrie described it as a place where "the buildings are so 
high the sun don't come out until 1:30 in the afternoon, and then it's visible 
for seven minutes between the Empire State Building and the shoeshine over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backlash Growing 
</P>
<P>
But today's projects, said Sen. Leichter, "are not just big. They're grandiose. 
It's like a game of, 'I Can Top You.' . . . There's a real backlash growing." 
</P>
<P>
Developers claim that in this confrontational climate, it has become harder to 
win approval for a project than it is to actually build it. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Eichner, whose 72-story Cityspire on West 55th Street has been one of the 
more controversial towers to pierce the Manhattan sky in the last few years, 
describes the trend as "the Tokyoization of Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
Few cities in the world restrict development so tightly as land-scarce Tokyo, 
where "sunshine right" is protected as a vested interest in the building code 
and even one dissenting vote in a neighborhood can tie up construction for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verges on Mystical 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Eichner's opponents argue that New York's old zoning 
strictures have crumbled in the era of super-scale developers. Today's giant 
skyscrapers materialize through a process that verges on the mystical. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner's Cityspire is a good example. He was able to build it almost twice as 
big as zoning would otherwise permit by: 
</P>
<P>
* Literally buying air from his neighbor at $32.50 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking advantage of a controversial city bonus plan. 
</P>
<P>
* And, finally, striking a bargain with city officials when he discovered he 
had accidentally built Cityspire too tall. 
</P>
<P>
His first step was to buy his neighbor's "air rights" -- the vacant space over 
a nearby building. Its owners literally subdivided the air and transferred the 
right to develop it to Eichner. 
</P>
<P>
Stacking such columns of air, a concept that has been used to a lesser extent 
in Los Angeles, is the chief means by which developers have gotten permission 
to build the spires that have elevated the Manhattan skyline in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes for Variety 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the concept note that transferring air rights makes for variety, 
far more attractive than developing areas into monotonous and forbidding blocks 
of buildings that are all the same size. Once they've sold their air rights, 
the buildings around a skyscraper are forced to remain small. 
</P>
<P>
But community groups often complain that such dealing can destroy the character 
of a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversial policy has been the city's practice of relaxing its 
zoning code in exchange for builders' providing services and amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he acquired his neighbor's air rights, Eichner could not construct 
Cityspire as big as he wanted it. So he took advantage of a city bonus plan, 
under which he could add 20% to the size of the building, if he gave the city 
something it wanted in return. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, developers have received bonuses for adding atriums or plazas; 
in others, for providing middle- or low-income housing. Sometimes bonuses are 
used to channel construction from densely developed areas to those where growth 
is considered desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner won his bonus by renovating the rundown City Center Theater near the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
But his story did not end there. As Cityspire was nearing completion, Eichner 
discovered he had inadvertently built it 11 feet too tall. So he went back into 
protracted negotiations with the city, and agreed earlier this year to donate 
rehearsal space for nonprofit dance companies in return for the right to keep 
the extra height. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner said the whole process has been a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the building being 800 feet and 811 feet is of no 
consequence to anyone," he complained. "I cannot for the life of me understand 
what public good was served by this fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
However, New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that the 
Cityspire saga symbolized a disturbing trend. 
</P>
<P>
Such dealings, he wrote, "turn the natural order of things upside down, and 
suggest that private developers can make their own rules, or at least negotiate 
with the city to revise the rules if they are not happy with them. . . . What 
is to prevent another developer from adding 22 feet to his building and 
offering to build two dance studios?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Ginsbergs, who are facing the prospect of having to demolish the 
top 12 floors of their apartment building on East 96th Street, tried to make a 
similar deal. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that they broke the law through no fault of their own -- they said they 
relied on a faulty city zoning map -- the developers offered to refurbish 
nearby tenements if they could keep the additional stories. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Mayor Edward I. Koch supported their proposal, but he has since 
reversed his position and supports the Board of Standards and Appeals decision. 
</P>
<P>
To Civitas, the group that alerted the city to the violation in July, 1986, the 
board's ruling is an important precedent. Too long, said Civitas president 
Genie Rice, the message to developers has been that if "you break the law, you 
pay your way out. That is part of doing business in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral candidate and City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin agreed: "The city 
should stop selling municipal indulgences." 
</P>
<P>
Con Howe, executive director of the City Planning Commission, rejected the 
contention that the city has been cutting too many deals with developers. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said that the city has removed many of the bonuses it used to offer -- 
such as allowing bigger buildings in exchange for theater renovations, atriums 
and arcades. In recent years, he said, it has added only one new type of bonus 
-- for developers who include low- and moderate-income housing in their 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, we've moved to 'as-of-right' development. That's the term we use 
where there's no special permission requested or granted," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that between 1978 and 1982, only 39% of the buildings in mid-town were 
built without special approval, bonuses or variances. In the next five years, 
the most recent for which figures are available, 80% of mid-town construction 
has "followed the letter of the zoning laws." 
</P>
<P>
But in the eyes of its critics, the city has been too eager a partner with 
developers, sacrificing rational urban planning for the sake of expanding its 
tax base and stretching its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Said Elliott Sclar, a Columbia University urban planning professor: "The only 
thing Mayor Koch had left to sell was the light and the air of Manhattan, so he 
began selling it with a vengeance." 
</P>

<HEAD>Height, Heat and Smoke Hamper Firefighters In High-Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting heat, smoke and flames at dizzying heights like Los
Angeles' 62-story First International Bank building can turn
firefighters into high-rise commandos facing special dangers and
physical punishment.
   ``It's like fighting a bungalow fire 200 feet in the air,'' said
Jerry Lawrence of the Chicago Fire Department, which protects the
1,454-foot tall Sears Tower, the tallest building in the country
and among the most fireproof.
   Skyscraper fires are physically exhausting to put out, with
firefighters huffing up stairs with 50 pounds of equipment and air
tanks on their backs. Reserves are called up often for relief and
to replenish air supplies.
   ``It's a very hazardous, punishing type of fire,'' said Roger
Lanaham of the U.S. Fire Administration in the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. ``You have to have shock troops. It's like a
tough football game. You have to keep bringing in fresh blood.''
   People trapped above the fire must be evacuated, sometimes by
helicopter but preferably down stairwells. And precautions must be
taken to keep those on the street from being showered with
heat-shattered glass.
   Aerial ladders and cranes reach no higher than 10 floors, so
firefighters work the fire from the inside, setting up a staging
area on a floor below the fire. They bring hoses, equipment, first
aid and compressed air. Oxygen is never carried because it can
ignite.
   ``It's a manual operation that takes more personnel than any
other fire. It's also an inside fire. They can't put the fire out
from the outside. That's what makes it so dangerous,'' said Joseph
Redden, spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association in
Quincy, Mass., a former Newark, N.J. fire chief.
   High-rise fires create a chimney effect, sucking heat and smoke
up stairwells and elevator shafts to the top of the building.
Firefighters open bulkheads or smash holes in the roof to prevent
explosive buildups.
   In the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., 74 of the
87 deaths came from smoke inhalation, according to fire officials.
Most victims were found trapped on the top seven floors of the
26-story building.
   Another fire that prompted improved designs and sprinkler
systems was a 1986 blaze that killed 97 people, including 84 on a
first floor casino, at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Three hotel workers pleaded guilty to setting the fire.
   ``In a fire, smoke is usually a killer, not the flames,'' said
John Mulligan, spokesman for the New York City Fire Department. ``A
high-rise fire is going to be hot and smoky and among the most
difficult firefighting conditions.''
   New York has 1,200 high-rises or buildings that are more than 75
feet tall. The city averages one fire per day in a high-rise,
although most are in lower floors and are easily contained,
Mulligan said.
   Firefighters say real life bears little resemblance to the
Hollywood hokum of the movie ``The Towering Inferno,'' in which
most of the stars scrambled to the roof to await rescue.
   ``You never want to get above the fire,'' Redden said. ``That's
the worst place you can be.''

TALLEST BUILDING. IT WAS SHAPED BY A TANGLE OF AGREEMENTS THAT PUT ELEGANCE AT

<P>
Looking north up Hope Street, you can see a radical change in the skyline of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One of Los Angeles' major urban vistas, once crowned by the charming tower and 
tiled pyramid of Bertram Goodhue's 1920s Central Library, is now dominated by 
the slim white cylinder of the 73-story First Interstate World Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tallest building on the West Coast, the 1,017-foot First Interstate 
tower looms over the Central Library, which is now undergoing a $150-million 
renovation and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by a team of New York City architects -- Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; 
Partners in association with Harold Fredenburgh -- the tower stands out on the 
downtown skyline as a graceful beacon visible for miles, marking the center of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
From close up, however, the tower is less elegant than it seems from a 
distance. The soaring shaft's faceted circular volume, narrowing toward the 
top, is too blandly detailed to hold the viewer's interest. 
</P>
<P>
And a sharp drop in level between Hope and 5th streets at the tower's base, 
marked by an outdoor grand stairway, adds to the feeling that the 
1.3-million-square-foot building, squeezed onto a small site, is a little too 
big for its boots. 
</P>
<P>
The building's developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, believes that the 
distinctive white tower is Los Angeles' "signature" skyscraper, the city's 
architectural climax. But the building is an act of architecture only 
secondarily. 
</P>
<P>
The primary art form expressed in the shape and character of the First 
Interstate World Center is not architecture, but a dizzying, seven-year 
exercise in deal making. 
</P>
<P>
The complex deals and trade-offs that made the tower possible limited the size 
of its site, added 20 floors to its height and determined the upper-level 
setbacks, which shaped its silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
After this, the architects' options were confined to finessing the tower's 
profile, detailing its skin and attempting to design a humanely scaled 
street-level presence for the massive shaft. 
</P>
<P>
This situation is analogous to having a painting's size, shape and composition 
negotiated by art dealers, then hiring an artist to fill in the colors and 
elaborate the picture frame. 
</P>
<P>
The artful deal making made concrete in the First Interstate tower was founded 
on a brilliant scheme to help pay for the Central Library's ambitious 
renovation and expansion without -- at that time -- spending a penny of public 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The plan involved an agreement by the city to sell the potential development 
rights presumed to exist in the air over the library to Maguire Thomas 
Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Shunted across 5th Street, this chunk of unbuilt air added the 20 extra stories 
to the height the First Interstate tower would normally have been permitted 
under current downtown zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
To finesse the deal, Maguire Thomas Partners then sold half the building's 
equity to Pacific Enterprises and negotiated a further agreement with the 
Community Redevelopment Agency to build another 52-story office high-rise on 
5th Street across Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
This is a bare-bones outline of a financial and political process that involved 
numerous city agencies and elected officials, First Interstate Bank, the major 
law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, broker and developer John C. Cushman III and 
a host of other players. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises President James R. Ukropina is reported to have said in a 
moment of exhaustion that the complex wheeling and dealing "pushed people to 
the edge of insanity." 
</P>
<P>
But developer Robert F. Maguire III views the process differently. He says the 
extra height added to the First Interstate tower was simply the result of a 
need to raise extra funds for the ever-increasing expense of the Central 
Library's expansion and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, we had envisioned no more than a 50-story building," Maguire said. 
"However, as the CRA and library staff plans for the library grew, costs went 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The library's budget increased so much, Maguire said, that the CRA proposed 
that he build the second building across Grand Avenue to provide additional 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never comfortable with having the tallest building in the city," 
Maguire insisted. "We are emphatically opposed to that kind of symbolism -- it 
is not in our culture." 
</P>
<P>
But now that the 73-story tower is a reality, Maguire feels it's "substantially 
superior to the earlier versions of 50 stories, that looked like a stuffed 
Polish sausage." 
</P>
<P>
After the deals were done, the architects were left to make what they could of 
the tower shape they were handed -- a challenge complicated by the awkward 
change of levels at the shaft's base. 
</P>
<P>
"Granting primacy at street level to Goodhue's great library was a major 
concern," designer Henry Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize this primacy, a dramatic "water garden" stairway, designed by 
noted landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, will lead pedestrians down from 
upper Hope Street to a point opposite the library's main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
This grand staircase, to be topped by a walk-in pavilion resembling a giant 
golden metal snake crafted by Frank Gehry, is intended as a "choreographed 
experience that captures the life and vitality of the city," according to 
Halprin. 
</P>
<P>
A water wall cascading over terraces and along channels running down the middle 
of the steps will form the backdrop for outdoor cafes and flower vendors. In 
this "urban theater" it is hoped that mimes and musicians will entertain 
lunchtime office workers. 
</P>
<P>
Once the configuration of the tower's base was determined, the main cylinder of 
the high-rise was designed. 
</P>
<P>
To shape the tall shaft's floor plans, and give the tower visual interest as it 
soared upward, principal designer Harold Fredenburgh played with variations of 
a circle laid over a square. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim was to enhance the tower's verticality and emphasize the skyward 
perspective," Fredenburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The faceted circular surface that resulted from this circle-in-a-square design 
fills out the tower's lower 45 stories. Above the 45th floor the shaft narrows 
down through a series of setbacks, emerging as a pure drum shape in the top 
five floors. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate World Center is a striking obelisk when viewed from a distance 
through the windshield of a car approaching downtown along one of the freeways 
that circle the central city. But as one comes close, the detailing of the 
tower's faceted pale-gray Sardinian granite with beige accents and flush-tinted 
windows, lack sufficient subtlety to interest the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Seen from below, the shaft's complex geometries are hard to decipher. And its 
horizontal banding seems at odds with Fredenburgh's aim to enhance a vertical 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The main lobby off 5th Street opposite the library is confusing. The tower's 
columns, sheathed in illuminated glass cases, block the front doors. The 
lobby's connection to the Hope Street entry four floors above is poorly thought 
out, and the auto drop-off for visitors seems like an afterthought slotted in 
at the back of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the vast and vivid lobby mural commissioned from artist David Hockney 
will succeed in giving the space a visual coherence. 
</P>
<P>
In the tower's interior the eccentric floor plans generated by the 
squared-circle shape allow offices of a variety of configurations, from wedges 
to octagons. 
</P>
<P>
The relative smallness of the floors compared to most modern office high-rises 
guarantees that few workers are far from a window. The top five circular levels 
offer panoramic views -- on smogless days -- from the San Gabriel Mountains to 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Structurally, the tower is designed to withstand an 8.3 earthquake -- Los 
Angeles' "Big One," predicted to strike within the next 30 years. The tower's 
massively reinforced central core and lighter perimeter columns form a 
framework flexible enough to resist violent side-to-side shaking, the 
architects and engineers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the blood, sweat and tears of the past seven years, developer 
Nelson Rising of Maguire Thomas Partners declares that he is "thrilled with 
this beautiful building." 
</P>
<P>
The venture has been, Rising said, "profitable and significant for Los Angeles 
in the creation of a signature tower for the city." 
</P>
<P>
If the First Interstate tower is indeed our urban signature, it can only be 
said that our identity is smudged. 
</P>
<P>
Given that the art was in the deal not the architecture, the First Interstate 
World Center could still have been the landmark that crowned Bunker Hill and 
redeemed the architectural mediocrity of most of our downtown towers. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been our equivalent of Manhattan's Chrysler Building, with a 
superb profile silhouetted against the sky and urbane proportions detailed to 
delight the eye from near and far. 
</P>
<P>
But the tower's designers and their patrons haven't quite risen to the 
occasion. They haven't come together to create a tower whose verve and grace 
might have made us forget the profits and the politics. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in this failure is that the First Interstate World Center 
development, despite its present identification with a big bank, began its 
complex life as a speculative commercial high-rise venture, not a corporate 
headquarters meant to symbolize the pride of a major enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
What this means can be seen by comparing First Interstate with another Maguire 
Thomas Partners development on Bunker Hill -- the Wells Fargo Center, 
originally the Crocker Center. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo/Crocker Center, designed as a corporate symbol, is a much more 
graceful and urbane project. The towers are planned to create a pleasant plaza 
at street level for people to sit and stroll and shop. Seen against the 
downtown skyline, the eccentrically shaped shafts make an intriguingly composed 
counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
In this achievement the architect's role was clearly central, not peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
Here the designer was not called upon simply to do a cosmetic job on a done 
deal, but to shape the project from the start, create it from the ground up. 
This fact alone makes Wells Fargo Center a much better act of urban 
architecture than First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that hectic horse trading, not architecture or urban design, is the 
primary interest powering many speculative commercial high-rises -- by far the 
large majority of our new towers -- explains why our proud new downtown has so 
few buildings of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
When even a respected and progressive developer like Maguire Thomas Partners 
reduces its architects to a relatively minor role in the game of 
make-me-a-city, what hope have we for an urban core that is more than a boring 
collection of built deals?

<HL> Trump May Sell 76-Acre Manhattan Site Of 'Tallest Building' Plan, Sources Say </HL>
<AUTHOR> Roger Lowenstein (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> REL </IN>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apparently abandoning plans to build the world's tallest building, Donald Trump is discussing the sale of a chunk of Manhattan real estate that was to have been the site of the developer's controversial Trump City. 

   Real estate industry sources say Mr. Trump is discussing the sale of the 76-acre site with several foreign groups. 
The leading contender is a group with overseas financing that is led by William Zeckendorf Jr., a Manhattan developer. 

   Various industry sources say that if a deal is reached, the price could top $500 million, more than five times the $88 million Mr. Trump paid for the site in 1984. 

   A spokesman for Mr. Zeckendorf declined to comment; so did Mr. Trump. 

   If Mr. Trump were to sell the site it would be a major victory for community activists, who have mounted a well-organized campaign to scale down the project. 
The activists have asserted that the massive project would congest local streets with traffic and destroy the neighborhood's character. 
The proposal included plans for 7,600 apartments, a giant indoor mall, offices, eight 60-story skyscrapers and a record-breaking 152-story tower. 

   "If a new developer tries to do what Mr. Trump did, our resistance will be as great," says Victor Kovener, a board member of People for Westpride Inc., a group that has rallied the area against Mr. Trump's proposal. 
"But something on a smaller scale might be appropriate." 

   Mr. Trump, in an interview last year, called the Hudson River site "the best piece of land in America." 
He vowed that he would overcome his opponents and get the project approved, even if it meant waiting years. 

   But in a speech last month, Mr. Trump complained that the approval process in New York City "takes years and years, and no matter what you do, there will be critics." 

   Mayor Edward I. Koch has said he is against Mr. Trump's proposal at its current size. 
And the developer lost a potential anchor tenant, General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit, because the network feared that the area's vociferous residents might stop the project. 

   The site, which consists of abandoned railroad yards on the West Side of Manhattan, is the biggest open tract near midtown. 
It has spurred numerous development schemes since the 1960s, but none has succeeded. 
A residential community proposed by the previous owner, Argentine industrialist Francisco Macri, died from bitter community opposition and lack of funds. 
Mr. Zeckendorf was a runner-up to Mr. Trump when Mr. Macri sold the site. 

   "If anyone can do it Zeckendorf can," says George Sternlieb, an urban policy professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J. 
"He is a superb soft salesman. 
Trump tried to take the zoning by assault." 

   Mr. Zeckendorf's potential plans for the area aren't known, though they probably would include housing on a smaller scale than Mr. Trump had proposed. 

   Mr. Zeckendorf, the son of a legendary builder whose empire collapsed, has himself become the most active local developer in recent years. 

   Mr. Trump also has approached institutions about buying a half-interest in the site. 
But sources close to the talks say he would prefer to sell the whole thing. 

   "With everything else he's doing," the West Side site "is a 10-year program and it's a monumental pain," one developer says. 

   Mr. Trump is negotiating to buy the East Coast air shuttle from Texas Air Corp. for more than $300 million and could reach an agreement this week. 
He recently bought the Plaza hotel in Manhattan for close to $410 million and is trying to acquire the Taj Mahal, a huge casino being developed in Atlantic City, N.J.

   A Japanese real-estate company is close to buying
the world's tallest building for at least $1.2 billion, a Los
Angeles firm representing the prospective buyer said Wednesday, but
the skyscraper's present owner said it wasn't involved in any sale
negotiations.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., which put the famed 110-story Sears Tower
up for sale on Oct. 31, said speculation that a Japanese buyer was
close to a deal was groundless.
   ``We are compiling a financial analysis, which is the first step
in the offering process,'' Sears said in a statement. ``We are not
involved in any negotiations at this time.''
   The 14-year-old structure, which rises 1,450 feet above the
downtown Loop, is expected to fetch a record price for a U.S.
building, surpassing the $660 million paid by Walter Shorenstein in
1985 for the Bank of America Building in San Francisco.
   Sears has said it is selling the tower as part of the giant
retailer's previously announced restructuring plan, but intends to
keep its corporate headquarters in the building.
   Jack Barthell, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of Los
Angeles, said the prospective buyer was a Japanese real-estate firm
that owns high-profile buildings in other cities and already has ``a
presence in Chicago.''
   His description prompted speculation that the client was Shuwa
Corp., a Japanese real estate developer with more than $2 billion in
U.S. holdings, including ABC's New York headquarters, the Arco Plaza
in downtown Los Angeles and the Quaker Oats Tower in Chicago.
   Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman in Los Angeles for Shuwa Investment
Corp., a Shuwa affiliate, said: ``The company generally doesn't
comment on those things. Essentially, there's no comment.''
   Barthell's statements drew a doubtful reaction from Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc., a New York-based real-estate firm that has
represented Japanese buyers in other large commercial property
transactions.
   ``I find it hard to believe that one client would risk $1.2
billion in one place on one property,'' said John Oharenko, managing
partner of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Chicago office. ``The deal is so
large that you would probably have to have more than one source of
capital.''
   Oharenko said the cash-rich Japanese likely would be involved in
buying the Sears Tower, but probably in conjunction with a U.S. firm.
   Direct Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate in the
past two years has totaled more than $15 billion, said Martin Sawa,
senior investment specialist in Cushman &amp; Wakefield's San Francisco
office.
   The sharp rise in Japanese purchases of top U.S. commercial
property in recent years _ a phenomenon linked partly to the weak
dollar _ has incited a backlash of resentment that most Japanese
firms would prefer to avoid, Oharenko said.
   Barthell said his unidentified client was sensitive to that
situation but undeterred by it.
   ``They are a very good corporate citizen, very philanthropic, and
they are known in the communities in which they do business as an
outstanding community citizen and leader,'' Barthell said., ``I
don't think they're put off by the profile and recognition that
buying the Sears Tower might give them.''

<HEAD>Initiative to Limit Downtown Seattle Growth on Ballot Tuesday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank
Building was completed in 1969, it towered over the downtown area
like a lone Douglas fir over a stand of alder.
   Today, the same building is lost in a skyscraper forest, and
critics of the city's ``Manhattanization'' are pressing voters
Tuesday to approve size limits on new downtown buildings.
   In a city often touted as one of the most livable in the nation,
much of downtown has been cast into shadow, cut off from sunny-day
vistas of Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and the Olympic and Cascade
mountains.
   Backers of Tuesday's CAP referendum, for Citizens Alternative
Plan, say they are trying to preserve a way of life. Most
developers and business boosters fear Seattle's boom could be
chased away.
   The 500-foot, 42-story Smith Tower, the tallest building west of
the Mississippi River when it was built in 1914, was once a source
of pride. The 975-foot, 76-story Columbia Center, now the West
Coast's tallest, has come to symbolize what some feel is runaway
downtown growth at the expense of the rest of the city. Office
space has virtually doubled in the past decade, and traffic
problems and other signs of congestion are increasing.
   The citizens' initiative would set limits on downtown
development for 10 years and clamps a 450-foot lid on new buildings.
   City Councilman Jim Street says he sees the main impact of CAP
as ``a message ... that the people of this city want better growth
management.'' Peter Steinbrueck, an architect and CAP campaign
leader, agreed that the major effect may be ``symbolic.''
   But John Gilmore, executive director of the Downtown Seattle
Association, which opposes the initiative, said the effect could be
more than symbolic. ``I don't think this is a `message' at all,''
he said. ``This is a 10-year plan that controls what happens
downtown.''
   CAP's potential effect is as unclear as the impact of its chief
model, Proposition M, approved by San Francisco voters in 1986.
With buildings now under construction, projects allowed under
permits issued before the initiative was filed and the limited
development permitted by CAP, the skyline could go up for years,
many observers say.
   Mayor Charles Royer, a CAP opponent, says that in California
there have been ``more than 200 of these slow-growth or no-growth
initiatives, and they really haven't had much effect.''
   CAP backers, including the Sierra Club, Church Council of
Greater Seattle, League of Women Voters, Puget Sound Council of
Senior Citizens and Allied Arts of Seattle Inc., have raised about
$14,000 while opponents have nearly $180,000, campaign spending
reports show.
   Nonetheless, supporters and even some opponents expect CAP to
win at the polls.
   ``There is an emotional appeal on the other side that is very
difficult to overcome,'' said Walt Crowley, chairman of the
anti-CAP Citizens for a Better Downtown.
   That appeal is ``a reaction against growth, a fear of change
that we all feel to some degree or another, because change itself
is fundamentally disturbing,'' said Crowley, a KIRO-TV commentator.
   Key provisions include the height limit _ about 38 stories, with
a 500,000-square-foot limit on annual construction of office space
for the first five years and double that amount in the second five.
   Buildings of 50,000 square feet or less would be exempt from the
square footage limit.
   The city's leading developer, Martin Selig, whose projects
include the 76-story Columbia Center, figures CAP would affect
development by ``about 8 percent ... in what you can build on a
given site.''
   The City Council has adopted temporary, less restrictive growth
controls to take effect if CAP is rejected, leading City Council
member Paul Kraabel to conclude, ``I think the philosophy of it has
already won.''
   Seattle's current downtown zoning plan, which includes only
indirect controls on building height and no construction volume
limits, was adopted in 1985 after 4{ years of debate.

TALL ORDER -- TRIM BUILDING 12 STORIES

How do you erect a 19-story building in New York City? 
</P>
<P>
Start with a 31-story structure. Discover that zoning prohibits a building that 
tall. Lose a three-year court fight. And receive an order to lop off 12 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to 108 East 96th St., the $7.2-million high-rise set to shrink this 
month in the final act of a showdown between local activists and its developer, 
Parkview Associates. David defeated Goliath recently when the city ruled that 
the 31-story edifice must lose its top dozen floors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces $10-Million Loss 
</P>
<P>
The decision will cost the developer about $10 million, leaving the building 
owners a little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take a while to digest this decision," Jay A. Segal, attorney 
for Parkview Associates, said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has dealt with a second Manhattan building found to be 
too tall. The 811-foot CitySpire project on West 54th Street is 14 feet higher 
than allowed by zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
But officials spared the building a steel haircut. Developer Ian Bruce Eichner 
reached a compromise agreement in which he will build a $2.5-million dance 
studio in return for a variance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Structure Unoccupied 
</P>
<P>
Parkview's $10-million loss includes the cost of chopping off the illegal 
floors, the income from the lost apartments and the cost of the building's 
extended vacancy. The structure remains unoccupied; it was to have opened in 
late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The odds do not look good for Parkview, which has unsuccessfully taken its 
fight to preserve the high-rise to the city, a local court, a state court and 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The city rejected a Parkview proposal to build about 40 low-income apartments 
for the elderly in East Harlem in return for a zoning variance leaving the 
building intact. 
</P>
<P>
Parkview has until April 27 to appeal its most recent defeat; the developer's 
last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that the too-tall ruling was 
arbitrary and capricious, Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Parkview decide not to appeal, the demolition will begin shortly after 
that date, city Buildings Department spokesman Vahe Tiryakian said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have 30 Days to Appeal 
</P>
<P>
"They have 30 days to appeal, and we're obliged to give 'em that," Tiryakian 
said. "We'll have to wait and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
While the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12 floors, many 
residents of the well-to-do area could not be happier about the unanimous 
decision by the city Board of Standards and Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really very, very pleased. We feel that, after this almost three-year 
battle, this was the right result," said Genie Rice, president of the local 
community group Civitas. 
</P>
<P>
It was Rice who first noticed that the 31-story building violated a 1973 
regulation putting a 19-floor limit on the area's skyline. Developer Albert 
Ginsburg, in getting a permit for the structure, used an incorrect zoning map. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Largely Finished 
</P>
<P>
When the error was discovered in 1986, workers had already completed the 
building's concrete superstructure, installed elevator shafts to the 27th floor 
and finished wiring and plumbing for the first 24 stories.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade of noisy construction in
downtown Hartford has given way to eerie silence.
   In one five-day period, Hartford ranked near the bottom of a
national survey of economic growth in urban areas, a once-popular
restaurant across the street from City Hall unexpectedly shut down
permanently, and, in an emotional blow to the entire downtown,
Sage-Allen &amp; Co. announced plans to close its 101-year-old
department store on Main Street.
   ``I was devastated,'' Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry said of the
Sage-Allen closing. ``I said `Wow!' ... It's the end of an era.''
   And there have been other setbacks. Two of Hartford's largest
downtown hotels shut down completely, taking 40 percent of the
city's hotel rooms with them. And West Hartford-based Colonial
Realty Co., which owns several of the city's biggest office towers,
was forced into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   At one point, things got so bad that a group of merchants held a
press conference downtown to announce that, contrary to rumors,
they were staying open.
   Business owners and city officials can take some comfort in
knowing that other large cities in Connecticut - and across New
England - are experiencing similar downturns in construction and
retail activity.
   But in Hartford, where civic groups have struggled for years to
coax people into a central business district dominated by insurance
giants like Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and The Travelers, the economic
slump has brought on a bout of civic soul-searching.
   ``Right now, we have lost the soul of the city,'' said Brad
Davis, a radio talk show host who has worked in the city for three
decades.
   ``The only thing that's going to save the city is to bring back
its soul,'' he said. ``People have got to be shown that we have an
identity. We're not Boston, and we're not New York. But we've got
our own identity.''
   Hartford, a city of 130,000 and the hub of a metropolitan area
of 750,000 people, faces the same problems as many other U.S.
cities - the flight of whites and the middle class to the suburbs,
the perception of high crime, parking and transportation.
   Efforts to revive downtown have met with some success. Union
Place, a glitzy corridor of nightclubs and restaurants near the
city's renovated railroad station, is packed with young people
several nights a week.
   A new retail row has sprouted on Pratt Street, an intimate side
street in the center of the city.
   And several civic groups are dedicated to breathing new life
into downtown. ``When things get a little tougher, you have to pull
together,'' said Tana Parseliti, whose family has run Frank's
restaurant in the heart of downtown for 46 years.
   Still, on many nights, downtown restaurants scramble for
business after office workers desert the area. Few people live in
the city's center. The district's only hardware store closed
recently, and there hasn't been a movie theater downtown in years.
   The corporations that dominate Hartford's downtown exist almost
as self-contained communities, complete with their own cafeterias,
health clubs and coffee shops, and connected by skywalks.
   ``A person can come in off the highway, go into one of these
corporations, and never come out until they leave town,'' said
Perry.
   ``We need a mixed city. We don't just need businesses and the
poor. And that's a national struggle for cities. It's not just a
Hartford struggle.''
   Buoyed by the growth of its large corporations, Hartford, the
state's capital, boomed in the 1980s. High-rises sprouted - and
sprouted; a developer announced plans to build the tallest building
in New England, a skyscraper stretching 888 feet, 8 inches.
   But when the region's economy slumped, downtown office vacancy
rates soared and the building stopped, leaving the city pockmarked
by vacant lots.
   After a protracted struggle against conservationists, developers
destroyed the city's first skyscraper, the 77-year-old Hartford
Aetna building, this spring to make room for a 45-story bank tower.
   But construction of the new tower has been delayed, and the site
now is marked by a giant crater, idle construction equipment and
several boarded-up storefronts.
   At the other end of Asylum Street, the glass-and-steel Parkview
Hilton that symbolized the new look of Hartford in the 1950s has
been shut down since New Year's Eve. Unable to find a buyer, the
hotel's owners scheduled an auction in early June, but then decided
to raze the building to make room for what they hope will be an
office tower.
   Hanging over the city's economic uncertainty are fears that
United Technologies Corp. may take its corporate headquarters out
of Hartford. The defense giant has announced plans to move its
headqarters, probably within the city, but has not disclosed a
final decision.
   Shortly after Sage-Allen announced it would close its downtown
store, 70-year-old Minnie Wright made a decision of her own. The
store's closing would change her shopping habits, she said. After
shopping at the downtown store for five decades, she now would take
the bus to a West Hartford mall to shop at the Sage-Allen there.
   ``All the stores are going out there,'' she said. ``Who's coming
in here?''
   She shook her head as she reminisced about downtown when it
bustled with department stores, cafeterias and five-and-dimes.
   ``It looks like it's on the way out,'' she said. ``Completely
out.''

   When the Union Oil Center was completed in downtown Los
Angeles in 1958, it was instantly hailed as a landmark. "The
building that freedom built," said Reese Taylor, then
president of the builder, Union Oil Co. -- a reference to the
fact that it was the city's first skyscraper built after
World War II.
   Thirty-four years later, the Unocal building is on Death
Row. Its current owners plan to tear it down in 1994, part of
a major new 12.6-acre development known as Los Angeles
Center. The old building is "functionally obsolete," says a
spokesman for the project's developer. The new office
complex, he says, will be more beautiful, more useful and
less expensive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps, but for many architects and preservationists,
beauty and efficiency are almost beside the point. Instead,
they see the Unocal building's fate as a precursor to the
preservationists' major battle of the '90s: the fight to save
buildings that are too young to live.
   For 25 years, preservationists have used federal and state
laws, tax breaks and public-relations campaigns to force and
persuade landlords not to destroy or alter significant old
buildings. The list of saved buildings is a long one,
including such well known and familiar landmarks as Grand
Central Station in New York and Wrigley Field in Chicago.
   But with so-called baby monuments, the old tactics don't
work. For one thing, federal and local laws generally only
protect buildings that are at least 50 years old. In
addition, many of these younger buildings haven't been around
long enough to win a consensus among academics and
professional historians as significant. And, perhaps most
important, few of them inspire the public to rise in protest;
they are not what most people would consider conventionally
beautiful.
   "Saving these old office buildings is difficult because
we're nearer in time, and people don't think of things they
use everyday as art," says Robert A.M. Stern, an architect
who heads the Preservation Department at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Architecture. "But unless
this attitude changes, the next generation will kill off the
previous one, mindlessly and wholesale."
   The problem is just beginning to crop up, as some of the
baby monuments reach the age where they are economically
questionable. Moreover, with the commercial real estate
industry in a recession, most new construction is on hold.
But preservationists predict widespread demolitions as soon
as the economy improves.
   Preventing those demolitions, however, will be tough.
After all, it's relatively easy to persuade the public to
save one-of-a-kind gems like Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim
Museum in New York or Louis Kahn's Kimball Museum in Fort
Worth, Texas. But the very thing that makes many baby
monuments valuable -- their ordinariness -- also makes them
vulnerable.
   Roger Kennedy, director of the National Museum of American
History in Washington, D.C., cautions against paying
excessive attention to the architectural gems in a city while
the background that creates a context for them is
annihilated. "We have to look at the whole setting," he says.
"We're in trouble if we have to knock the tooth out before we
know how pretty the teeth were."
   Office buildings are a particularly hard sell, says
Timothy Brandt, an architect with the Historic Resources
Group in Los Angeles, because their destruction doesn't get
people angry. "A corporation owned it," says Mr. Brandt. "It
has no sentimental value. People are not emotional about
offices."
   Nowhere is this clearer than with the example of the
12-story glass and steel Unocal building. Built in a rundown
area that had not seen first-class architecture before, it
represented the optimistic attitudes of the day. The tallest
building in the city, it sat on a hill, 70 feet higher than
the buildings downtown to the east.
   Crescent-shaped, more like a boat than the usual
right-angled glass boxes of its day, the Unocal building had
a double wall to accommodate permanent shades as protection
against the often punishing Southern California sun. The
first new building in town for a single client, it was
bowed-out towards the freeway, a graceful acknowledgment that
these new multi-lane roads would be the streets of the city's
future.
   The Unocal building remained for years the only thing on
dilapidated Crown Hill. No builders followed the oil company
-- which is now called Unocal Corp. -- west of the Harbor
Freeway, preferring the company of the increasingly glitzy
Los Angeles skyline only a mile away.
   Then in 1988, Unocal saw a wonderful opportunity. The land
around its headquarters had inflated in value, and would be
particularly attractive to a buyer if the Unocal building
wasn't there. So the corporation sold its property for about
$200 million to UC Land Associates, a closely held affiliate
of Hillman Properties, Newport Beach, Calif. Hillman and its
co-developer, Smith &amp; Hricik Urban Development Inc., now plan
a major development -- called Los Angeles Center -- which
will include five office towers and a 500-room hotel. Unocal,
which has been leasing back its old headquarters, will
relocate to 23 floors of one of the new 43-story office
towers. The old building will be torn down.
   While granting that the old Unocal headquarters is a
"lovely piece of nostalgia," architect Scott Johnson, the
principal design partner at Johnson, Fain &amp; Pereira, and the
partner in charge of designing the new buildings, says that
it won't be missed. Unocal "holds its place in history," he
says, "but it doesn't meet the ergometrics of the office."
   For him, the old Unocal building -- which ironically was
designed by former principals of his own firm -- was doomed
by its outdated "monolithic" plan, with each floor similarly
and inflexibly divided by interior walls and a core where all
the utilities crowded out rentable space. The building's plan
also didn't provide the sorts of open floors required for
modern telecommunications and computing. And the cost of
modernizing the sprinkler system, and removing asbestos,
would have been enormous.
   Besides, says Mr. Johnson, the "idea of a corporate palace
has disappeared. The time for one building exclusively for
one company is over." Corporate offices, he adds, "must be
considered as assets, not just as houses or work places."
   The new office complex has yet another virtue: In a city
where open space downtown is hard to come by, the developers
are acquiring an additional five acres to make parks and
plazas. The new buildings will only occupy one-third of the
total site.
   Preservationists, however, aren't swayed.
   "Preservation doesn't mean pretty," says William Delvac, a
local lawyer active with the Los Angeles Conservancy. Mr.
Delvac sees beauty in rarity as well as simply architectural
aesthetics. For Los Angeles, where the downtown is tiny in
comparison to its vast sprawl, each example of urban-scale
architecture is precious.
   Until now, preservationists' first line of defense has
been to educate the public; instructing people about their
city's architectural heritage has saved some great old
buildings. Yet some preservationists, including Mr. Delvac,
feel it is time to get more militant. Education is fine, but
it takes too much time, and for young buildings like Unocal
that do not enjoy a natural constituency, time has already
run out.
   Mr. Delvac considers the Unocal building a lost cause. But
for future baby monuments, he is considering using the
California Environmental Quality Act as a way to get serious
attention from local officials. Under the act,
preservationists can petition local authorities to consider
the old building as a historic resource. The authorities,
such as the Los Angeles City Council, would then have to
study the threatened building, considering its value and
alternatives to it. At the least, it bogs down deliberations.
Preservationists hope that such long delays would deter all
but the most determined and solvent developers.

<HL> Sale Price of Sears Tower Is Expected To Break U.S. Office Building Record </HL>
<AUTHOR> Roger Lowenstein (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. should be able to sell its Sears Tower headquarters for $800 million to $1.2 billion and break the record for the sale of a U.S. office building, real estate analysts say. 

   As the world's tallest building and Chicago's best-known landmark, analysts say it should attract a flood of interest from Japanese and other foreigners, as well as from capital-rich, opportunity-scarce U.S. pension funds. 

   "You're talking about one of the prime trophy buildings not only in Chicago but in the country," says Robert Rosen, president of Frain Camins &amp; Swartchild, Inc., a big Chicago real estate broker. 
"You have the kind of property that will attract the biggest pension money in the world, and with very aggressive buyers." 

   However, Sears plans to move out all but 600 of its 8,700 employees in the tower, meaning that roughly two-thirds of the building could become vacant. 
Chicago could thus suffer one of the greatest corporate defections of any city in years. 

   The market value of the building could vary widely depending on how fast the employees are moved out and on whether Sears assumes some of the risk for leasing the space. 

   "It becomes very speculative," says Willard Brown, chairman of Rubloff Inc., a Chicago real estate concern. 
If too much space is dumped on the market at once, he says, "it could have a major depressing effect" on the value of the building. 

   Sears says it will move the employees, who are part of the Sears merchandise group, over a two-year period which will begin after it has chosen a new location. 
The retailer will keep its corporate staff and headquarters in the Sears Tower. 

   The company said the merchandise employees will be moved to a less expensive site, possibly outside of Chicago. 
"We don't want to use space that could bring a premium if isn't necessary," a Sears spokesman said. 
"These are operations that can be done in lower cost real estate." 

   The dark gray, glass and steel Sears Tower stands 110 stories and 1454 feet (1,707 feet including the twin antenna towers atop it). 
The building, which opened in 1973, attracts 1.5 million paying visitors annually -- more people than paid to see the Chicago White Sox play this year. 

   The tower, on South Wacker drive, has 3.6 million rentable square feet, 98% of which is occupied. 
Brokers say the best commercial buildings in Chicago fetch $250 to $300 a square foot, putting the Sears building in the $1 billion range. 

   The value of the tower will be lessened because of the relocation of the Sears employees. 
New tenants in Chicago usually demand a period of free rent and significant physical improvements, costs which Sears will probably have to absorb. 

   But brokers say the intangible value of owning a landmark could compensate for that. 
Mr. Rosen says "trophy buildings are difficult to value because you have to ask what motivates people." 

   Adds Mr. Brown: "Without any question, someone is going to overpay for the ego of owning the world's tallest building." 

   Sears, which retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to handle the sale, could fetch a higher price by contracting to lease back space from the buyer at a high rent. 

   Previous records for U.S. office buildings include Citicorp's sale of parts of two Manhattan buildings for $670 million and BankAmerica Corp.'s sale of its San Francisco headquarters for $660 million. 

   The vacancy rate for Chicago's prime buildings is 11%, and the city's real-estate market is generally considered healthy. 
However, Homart Development Co., a real estate development subsidiary of Sears, is planning to build a two-million square foot building across the street from the Sears Tower. 
If Homart breaks ground next spring, as scheduled, it would be in competition with Sears Tower and would potentially reduce its value. 

   Sears said it would retain the Homart subsidiary, one of its most valuable real estate assets. 
Homart owns 21 shopping centers and 19 office buildings. 
Shopping centers currently are a hot item and are selling for as much as 20 times cash flow. 

   However, Sears said it would sell its Coldwell Banker Commercial Group subsidiary, the country's largest commercial broker. 

   Coldwell Banker Commercial is expected to sell for $150 million to $225 million, real estate industry sources said. 
It will earn an estimated pretax profit of $25 million to $30 million this year on revenue of roughly $400 million. 
Sources close to the Los Angeles-based broker said Coldwell's managers might buy the business from Sears in a leveraged buy-out. 
James Didion, chairman of the group, declined to comment. 

   In line with Sears's decision to remain strong in consumer businesses, the company will hang on to its huge Coldwell residential housing brokerage business.

Who's wearing the pants when it comes to downtown redevelopment? 
</P>
<P>
The Centre City Development Corp.'s approval last month of a 36-story luxury 
condominium tower shows that the financial viability of a project often takes 
precedence over urban design concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Going against the advice of its design specialists, the CCDC granted exclusive 
negotiating rights for the high-rise project to the Koll Co.-Davidson 
Communities team. It will be built at the southwestern corner of State Street 
and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Architect Mike Stepner and CCDC urban-design expert Max Schmidt both 
objected to the height of Koll's project, known as the Huntington and designed 
by San Diego architects Lorimer-Case. Even CCDC board President John Davies had 
reservations about its 472-foot height, which will make it one of the two or 
three tallest buildings downtown, dwarfing its immediate neighbors: the 
20-story Koll Center just to the west, the mid-rise Columbia Tower seniors 
housing project to the south and the six-story Hotel San Diego to the east. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Argument 
</P>
<P>
Approval came only after the CCDC's economic consultants, Keyser Marston, 
stated that a 10-story reduction in the building's height 'would materially 
affect the feasibility of the project.' Potential buyers of the $300,000 to $1 
million homes, according to Davies, would only be lured by a landmark building. 
Apparently nothing less than 36 stories would do. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Smyk, the developer of the Meridian, San Diego's existing luxury high-rise 
condo tower, doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"A landmark building doesn't sell condos," he said. "A landmark building has 
more value for office prestige than condos. The important things are the views 
and the interior layouts. My opinion is the best views in the Meridian are on 
the 12th or 15th floors. I live on the 24th, and it's too high. There's no 
relationship to the street or other activities. The higher you go, the views 
almost get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Also, there aren't that many buyers for such pricey condos. What if Smyk, who's 
sold 130 of 172 luxury units in the Meridian in four years and may find his 
project competing with Koll's when it comes on line, has already tapped out the 
market? 
</P>
<P>
If a lower luxury condo tower simply didn't appeal to developers, why not a 
different brand of project? 
</P>
<P>
Competing developer A. J. Lirot's proposed 400-foot rental apartment tower was 
more in scale with the neighborhood. The architecture wasn't everyone's 
favorite, but the size was right on. CCDC felt the Koll team was stronger 
financially, and wasn't swayed when Lirot brought in high-powered developer 
Trammell Crow as a partner after the submissions deadline. 
</P>
<P>
A look at CCDC's original request for proposals (RFP) for the State and 
Broadway site, and subsequent alterations to it, show that CCDC was resigned 
months ago to a building the size of the Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The first RFP asked for a building matching the adjacent Koll Center in scale. 
In November, under pressure from the Koll team, CCDC decided to permit a 
building of 600,000 square feet on a site that, by some interpretations of 
CCDC's guidelines, should have accommodated about half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flip-Flop Decisions 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington occupies only part of a larger piece of redevelopment land 
referred to as "Parcel C," which also includes the Koll Center and the Columbia 
Tower. In simple terms, the CCDC decided that, because the Koll Center wasn't 
built to the maximum allowable height for Parcel C, the new condo tower would 
be allowed to use up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Such flip-flops are what will determine whether we get a hospitable downtown 
with ample glimpses of blue sky and sunlight or a Manhattan-like urban core 
where giant buildings dwarf the scale of smaller nearby structures. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Great American Plaza, under construction across Broadway a few blocks 
west of the Huntington will be of equal height. But, from the northern side of 
Broadway, it won't cast shadows on downtown's most significant street. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Stepner commented on the Huntington, "When you're a block away, you 
will see the relationship between the various buildings and will notice the 
height. It's not a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
Since the '60s, the CCDC's Schmidt, in various capacities as a city planner, 
has favored locating downtown's tallest buildings near Interstate 5 and Cortez 
Hill, site of the El Cortez Hotel. In his ideal scenario, they would have 
decreased in height closer to the water, giving most downtown offices and 
residences good bay views and keeping the waterfront free from a wall of 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
But '60s and '70s high-rises were built in the heart of downtown. Now, with the 
intense development of lower Broadway, including not only the Huntington but 
the Great American project and the 30-story Emerald Shapery Center nearby, 
along with hotel and residential towers along Harbor Drive, Schmidt's fantasy 
is being reversed, with the tallest buildings closest to the water. 
</P>
<P>
If CCDC is willing to let economics double the size of Koll's building, what 
will happen in the '90s when a huge new wave of high-rise proposals comes in 
for the substantial properties near the water owned by Santa Fe (the railroad 
company) and the Navy? 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that height got out of hand at the Huntington, because, in other 
ways, it shows just how much progress the CCDC is making in getting good 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Character 
</P>
<P>
Unlike existing downtown high-rises, this one has a base, middle and a 
distinctive top the architects hope to sheath in copper. The base is scaled to 
match older nearby buildings such as the YMCA and Hotel San Diego, both in 
height and detailing, with the tower set back from the base. Altogether, the 
design, as Schmidt noted in his design analysis, gives the building a 
distinctly residential character apart from downtown's office high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
With CCDC giving Koll a discount on land the public agency has owned for 
several years, San Diegans have a right to expect the highest urban design 
standards, even if they won't be able to afford a home there. Koll bid $2 
million for the land, valued by a downtown real estate expert at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stepner believes a smaller building, even a condominium tower, could have been 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the fine points of the deal, but, from my experience over the 
years, I know that each developer will take the same exact situation and create 
a different deal that works for him. 
</P>
<P>

TAKING GASLAMP DESIGN TO NEW HEIGHTS? SOME HOPE NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute between city planners and Gaslamp Quarter property owners over height 
limits in the historic downtown district is fast approaching a City Council 
showdown, with the character of the zone's future development very much in the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the issue lies in the 60-foot height limit -- with an extra 15 feet 
allowable under certain conditions -- that the city wants to keep in place for 
the 16 1/2-block district that straddles 5th Avenue from Broadway to Harbor 
Drive. Backers say the height limit is essential to preserve the character of 
the Gaslamp, where 81 of 90 buildings are 60 feet high or shorter. 
</P>
<P>
The Centre City Development Corp., the city's redevelopment agency; the city 
Planning Department, and the Historical Site Board, a citizens advisory group 
on matters of historic preservation, all back the 60-foot limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether or not we are going to respect the historic character of 
the district and live up to our own policy direction," said senior city Planner 
Ron Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposing side is the Gaslamp Quarter Council, a group that includes 200 
business and property owners. The group has proposed an amendment to the 
ordinance that would allow certain projects to include "tower elements" of 
heights up to 125 feet, set back from the street to accommodate hotel, 
apartment or condominium development, said Craig Lee, executive director of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the Gaslamp Quarter Council proposal, the 60-foot limit would be 
observed in all new Gaslamp development except in projects south of Island 
Street and on parcels of half a block or more in size. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that taller heights are appropriate on 5th Avenue south of Island 
because the area contains few buildings of historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels and residential towers would generate more foot traffic in the quarter, 
he added, bringing more business to Gaslamp shop owners while discouraging 
panhandlers and homeless people from congregating. 
</P>
<P>
"We need flexibility to bring special projects into the quarter," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to vote next month on the proposed ordinance 
amendment. The opposing sides concede that some kind of amendment is needed 
because the existing law allows the city planning director to grant exemptions 
to the height limitations at his discretion, without specifying how much and 
under what circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's vote will directly affect three proposed projects that would 
exceed existing height limits. The farthest down the planning pipeline is the 
Brunswig Square Project, planned for the full block bounded by 5th and 6th 
avenues and J and K streets. Principals Ed Murphy, Michael Farres and architect 
Bruce Dammann hope to build a 300-room, 13-story hotel on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The taller height is necessary, Dammann said, so the $28-million hotel project 
can compete in the "view-oriented" hotel market. 
</P>
<P>
Another project, a 200-foot-high condominium tower, is being developed by Neil 
Senturia for property bounded by 4th and 5th avenues, the Santa Fe Railroad 
tracks and K Street. Senturia is also developing the twin-tower One Harbor 
Drive condo project for a site nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wolfsheimer, a San Diego attorney who represents Senturia, said the 
Gaslamp area may die economically "unless we do something to attract more 
people to the quarter. . . . This property, located just across Harbor Drive 
from the 120-foot San Diego Convention Center (now under construction) needs 
some height to attract people to live down there. We think it might be the 
catalyst to get Gaslamp moving." 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the 12-story Horton Park Plaza hotel on 5th Avenue at E Street, a 
75-year-old building formerly known as the Jewelers' Exchange, have proposed 
building a second tower of equal height on an adjacent lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lee argues that judicious exceptions to the height limit should be allowed if 
for no other reason than the fact that a handful of the historic buildings in 
the area, such as the Horton Park Plaza and the St. James Hotel, already exceed 
the cap. 
</P>
<P>
Planner Buckley disagreed, saying the tall buildings in the Gaslamp are 
"historical aberrations" and should not be used to justify new construction of 
tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The district was created to preserve the unique character and scale of 
Gaslamp, and if you start making exceptions, you jeopardize that," he said.

FUTURE SPARKLES IN RESURGENT CLEVELAND

<P>
In Tower City, the centerpiece of this city's downtown renaissance, visitors 
pass by fountains and boutiques to consider an exhibit made of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
They're looking at a model of downtown Cleveland in the year 2000, a remarkable 
tangle of hotels, parks, public works and stunning architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the vision could prove to be fantasy. But judging from the cranes 
towering over the United States' 12th-largest metropolitan area, much of the 
construction is already under way. From the shores of Lake Erie to the city's 
Public Square, Cleveland is welding and riveting its way into the next century. 
As the United States slips toward recession, this gritty Rust Belt survivor 
actually suffers from a shortage of construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the activity is Clevelanders' willingness to spend money, bury their 
differences and unite around common goals. The city's experience provides a 
good lesson for other major cities facing hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the results more evident than downtown, where builders are trying 
to catch up on decades of pent-up demand. Until recently, Cleveland was a time 
capsule that preserved old structures because nothing was built to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's problems were numerous, including a crisis of confidence caused by 
burning ghettos, bumbling mayors, a river that caught fire and the collapse of 
its steel, automobile and machine-tool industries. When Cleveland defaulted on 
its bond obligations in 1978, it looked as if the city might never recover. 
</P>
<P>
But it fought back. Mayor George Voinovich, now governor-elect of Ohio, helped 
reverse the decline by getting business, political and community leaders to 
agree on what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"When you had the economic problems we had in the early 1980s, you really 
didn't have much choice," said Richard Shatten, executive vice president of 
Cleveland Tomorrow, an economic development group made up of chief executives 
from Cleveland's 50 largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a combination of private and public efforts that reshaped the 
skyline and fostered employment. One example: A tax abatement to get LTV Steel 
to invest an additional $1 billion in the area. The effort preserved 6,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Albert Ratner, a Clevelander whose projects include the 16-acre 
MetroTech development in Brooklyn, N.Y., chipped in by taking on the Terminal 
Tower, the Depression-era skyscraper that dominates the skyline. He converted 
the old railroad station at the base of the tower into a splashy development 
with a Ritz-Carlton hotel and three levels of shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Tower City is only the latest in a series of projects. On the opposite side of 
Public Square, an office tower being built has surpassed the Terminal Tower as 
the city's tallest structure. When completed next fall, the 948-foot bank 
headquarters will be the tallest building between New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the $344 million Gateway sports complex, a massive project that is 
getting started on the edge of downtown. In an age of public financing of 
sports facilities, the project -- which includes a stadium for the Indians 
baseball team and an arena for the Cavaliers basketball team -- stands out 
because of the role played by private investors. 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved a tax on liquor and tobacco to pay half the cost and private 
investors agreed to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fantastic what they've done to this city in recent years," said Bill 
Carroll, a public affairs manager of Ford Motor Co., the city's largest private 
employer, with 17,000 workers. Ford is investing $2 billion in its 
Cleveland-area factories. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland still has serious problems. The city's schools are considered 
weak, and old-line manufacturers routinely close plants. Cleveland's growth 
still lags behind its rivals, Columbus and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a city where one can buy a four-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of 
Shaker Heights for $129,900, Cleveland has an appeal that should help it over 
the humps.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced plans to
sell Sears Tower, its corporate headquarters and the world's
tallest building, as part of an effort to streamline the company.
   Sears' restructing plan also will include a stock buyback,
``intense cost-cutting'' programs and the sale of its commercial
real estate subsidiary, the nation's largest retailer said.
   ``We are acutely aware of investors' desires for improved
returns and enhanced share value,'' Edward Brennan, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``And over the past
year, we have thoroughly evaluated all strategic and financial
alternatives available to the company.
   ``These alternatives have been reviewed not only with regard to
shorter-term valuation objectives, but also giving consideration to
the longer-term needs of our customers and $526,000 employees, the
financial strength of our company and fulfillment of Sears'
long-term strategic potential,'' Brennan said.
   The Sears Tower, which rises 110 stories _ 1,450 feet _ from the
grid of the downtown Loop business district, was built in 1974.
   The statement did not indicate how much Sears hoped to get for
the landmark building.
   Brennan said it would continue to serve as corporate
headquarters for the company, although the 8,000-employee Sears
Merchandise Group would be moved to smaller, less costly facilities
over the next several years.
   The move would leave just 600 Sears workers in the building,
officials said. Counting employees of both Sears and other
companies, there are now about 13,000 people working at the tower.
   Sears said it anticipated $425 million in expenses related to
the sale of the building and other changes announced today, and
would deduct that amount from fourth-quarter earnings.
   However, the company said it expected to add $340 million in net
income for the year as a result of other accounting changes.
   The stock buyback program will be aimed at acquiring up to 40
million shares of Sears common stock, or approximately 10 percent
of the company's 380 million outstanding shares.
   The restructuring plan also calls for divestiture of the
commercial division of Sears' Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group,
redirection of its Allstate Business Insurance division and
strengthening of its financial services subsidiary, Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., with a greater commitment to consumer-driven
activities.
   The corporate moves to cut costs and redeploy assets ``will
enable Sears to compete more effectively and profitably in its
merchandising, insurance, financial services and real estate
businesses,'' Brennan said.
   At a news conference today, Brennan was asked what message the
restructuring plans were intended to send to Sears' huge number of
customers. ``The message is we are positioning Sears strategically
and financially for a period of unprecedented growth,'' he said.
   But Sears stock declined 87{ cents to $42.75 a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading today after the restructuring was announced.
   Speculation about a restructuring of Sears have been circulating
for months, as have reports that the company was seeking to sell
off several of its divisions.
   Last Tuesday, Sears reported its third-quarter net income fell
16 percent from the year-earlier period, marking the third
consecutive quarter of declining profits. It blamed the results on
flat merchandise sales and intense competition from other retailers.
   Net income for the quarter totaled $344.2 million, or 90 cents
per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30. That compared with
$409 million, or $1.08 a share, for third-quarter 1987.

   Who wants to buy the Sears Tower?
   Not me, says Donald Trump.
   Not us, say the Japanese.
   But local real-estate auctioneer Joel Zegart believes these big
spenders will be among the bidders if Sears, Roebuck and Co. buys
his proposal to hold a public auction for the world's tallest
building.
   ``I think it's a smokescreen,'' Zegart, president of JBS &amp;
Associates Inc., said Wednesday of the many denials among those seen
as the most likely bidders for the 110-story headquarters of the
nation's largest retailer.
   ``I think a lot of people are interested and they just aren't
showing their cards yet,'' he said.
   Sears announced Monday it would sell its famed skyscraper as part
of a corporate restructuring designed to boost profits.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the company received a
number of inquiries following its announcement, but he would not
reveal the identities of the interested parties.
   Fairweather also would not comment on the idea of a public
auction.
   He said the sale, which is being handled by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
in conjunction with Sears' own Coldwell Banker real-estate and Dean
Witter Reynolds financial units, would be negotiated privately with
selected prospective buyers who would be invited to submit bids.
   But Zegart, whose firm specializes in auctions of large
investment properties, said a public auction open to all would
generate tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest
price Sears could hope to receive.
   He said he would start the bidding at $800 million. Analysts say
the building could fetch as much as $1.8 billion.
   Zegart, comparing the one-of-a-kind Sears Tower to a work of art,
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987
auction of Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was to the seller in that case.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. paid $40 million for
the painting by the Dutch Impressionist.
   ``The Sears Tower is a building that you'll never see reproduced
again,'' Zegart said.
   ``You're buying a piece of Chicago when you buy the Sears Tower.
It's the gem of the downtown. It's history, it's a landmark, it's
known around the world.''
   Several Japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that
make them wary.
   ``This is like buying a piece of America's heart,'' Tokyo-based
investment analyst Masahiko Muranaka told the Chicago Tribune.
   ``That building is a symbol of America and no Japanese company
would be courageous enough to try and buy it,'' Naoya Nishimura,
manager of overseas real estate for Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Co.,
told the Tribune. ``It would be like trying to buy the Empire State
Building.''
   The Trump Organization, which was also seen as a likely bidder
for the tower, is not interested in the Sears building, spokeswoman
Norma Foerderer said.
   Donald Trump, who made his name and fortune in New York real
estate, owns Manhattan's Plaza Hotel and Trump Tower, as well as
other properties there and in Atlantic City, N.J. He recently agreed
to buy Eastern Airlines' northeastern shuttle service.
   Sears, struggling to improve its earnings after three consecutive
quarters of declining profits, announced the planned sale of the
tower as part of a restructuring that also included the proposed
sale of its Coldwell Bankers commercial real estate subsidiary.
Sears also said it would buy back 10 percent of its 380 million
outstanding shares and take $425 million in fourth-quarter charges.
   The company said it would concentrate on consumer-oriented
businesses _ retailing, insurance, residential real estate and
financial services. It announced a revamping of its retailing
strategy, saying it would adopt the everyday low pricing policy that
has worked for its discount store competitors.

A developer wants to turn the Sears Tower into the world's second-tallest 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Miglin-Beitler Developments Inc. announced plans Monday for a slender, 
125-story skyscraper resembling a rocket emerging from the Loop. The 1,914-foot 
structure would eclipse by 400 feet the Sears Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The developer did not say how much the concrete and steel-reinforced skyscraper 
would cost. Plans have been submitted to the Chicago Planning Commission.

<P>
Construction could begin by December and could be completed by mid-1992, the 
developer said.

The building, being designed by architect Cesar Pelli, of New Haven, Conn., 
would contain 1.2 million square feet of office space, only about one-third the 
rentable space of the Sears Tower.

S.F. HIGH-RISES SURVIVE QUAKE WITH ONLY MINOR DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: REVISED BUILDING CODES AND NEWER CONSTRUCTION SHOULD KEEP TALL 
BUILDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES STANDING FIRM AFTER A STIFF QUAKE.

<P>
The gleaming skyscrapers that make this city the Manhattan of the West Coast 
survived the shuddering vibrations of the Oct. 17 quake with only minor damage, 
city officials and structural engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
A Bechtel engineer who participated in a crash inspection program, as well as a 
Los Angeles city engineer, said the results should be encouraging for Los 
Angeles, where tall buildings are of more recent vintage. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-story Bank of America building, built in 1969, received a mere $5,000 in 
damage. The landmark TransAmerica building, finished in the early 1970s, had 
minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
And the newer 101 California building, a recent glass-and-steel addition to the 
Market Street canyon, came through unscathed except for cracks in stairwell 
plasterboard and minor damage to a loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Chiu, San Francisco's chief building inspector, said as the high-rise 
inspection program wound down that none of the estimated 400 buildings taller 
than 75 feet that had been inspected since the quake, sustained major 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Only six received damage severe enough to restrict access, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the city's strict, updated earthquake code that mandates 
that buildings built under looser requirements be modernized and to a good 
enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why the high-rises could withstand this 7.0 quake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiu led a team of city building and fire inspectors, supplemented by about 100 
volunteer Bechtel Corp. engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrating at first on the buildings constructed before 1975, when building 
code amendments inspired by the 1971 Sylmar quake took effect, the inspectors 
looked for obvious structural problems, as well as damage to facades and 
jutting parapets. 
</P>
<P>
While no major structural problems were reported, Bechtel Corp. engineer Jim 
Appleton said damage to the parapet on the old Channel 7 building on Golden 
Gate Avenue was visible from across the street. "Another shake and she would 
have come down on the building adjacent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 20 -- after completing inspections on almost all of the older buildings 
-- the team began focusing on more modern buildings. The results from the first 
inspections of the modern buildings were even more reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
At the 101 California building, the emergency power kicked in right after the 
quake, and the sprinkler system stayed in place. Nothing fell off the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," said Jim Barjioni, the building's chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Terry McGillivray, a Bechtel structural engineer who helped organize the 
volunteer inspector corps, said a number of factors contribute to the good 
performance of modern high-rise buildings under the strains of an earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
* Because they are bigger, they are less likely to resonate in step with the 
typical ground vibrations that can cause a smaller structure to shake more and 
more violently. 
</P>
<P>
* The steel frame construction, which can sway more than a foot at the top of a 
tall building, can absorb vibrational energy and is far less likely to fly 
apart, compared to load-bearing walls made of brick or unreinforced concrete 
block. 
</P>
<P>
* Larger new buildings typically are engineered better than older, smaller 
buildings. Careful analysis of the soil underneath makes settling less likely. 
</P>
<P>
McGillivray said a more careful analysis of the performance of San Francisco's 
skyscrapers will be done, along with an examination of ground motions and 
stress calculations for specific structures. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, a computer will re-enact the quake motions of the 101 
California building, which had seismographs in its basement as well as on the 
8th, 24th and 48th floors. 
</P>
<P>
McGillivray said his experience in inspecting San Francisco high-rise buildings 
has led him to conclude that Los Angeles would fare as well or better in a 
quake the same force of Tuesday's in San Francisco. The Los Angeles code is 
similar to San Francisco's for high-rise construction. 
</P>
<P>
"For Los Angeles, with a newer skyline, you would be awfully surprised if there 
was any kind of damage at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more modern buildings that have been designed for more recent (building) 
codes should be good for larger earthquakes (than the Oct. 17 temblor)." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles building code is updated every three years, and requires 
minimum standards designed to save most lives but not prevent all damage in a 
quake the strength of the San Francisco temblor, said Doc Mghiem, an engineer 
in the city of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, earthquake safety 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using basically the same code (as San Francisco), Mghiem said, and 
modifying it as needed, taking into account the condition of the soil, a 
building's distance from known faults and its likely distance from the 
anticipated epicenter of a quake. 
</P>
<P>
"High-rises (in downtown L.A.) behaved pretty well after the Whittier quake," 
he said. "We would expect the same good behavior if we got a quake similar to 
the San Francisco quake." Buildings would remain standing, he said, but 
ceilings and partitions would fall and business as usual could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
Mghiem said the Los Angeles code is just the minimum required for basic safety 
and "in order to get a building behaving better than that, you have to do 
something better than barely the minimum. If a real big one hits, if ceilings 
come down -- and they do come down -- there will be some damage, some 
interruption of business and some destruction here and there, depending on how 
much above code the buildings were designed." 
</P>
<P>
Mgheim said the city's priority for building quake safety in Los Angeles since 
1981 has been on rehabilitating older high-rises where low-income residents 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council is very concerned about giving the homeless something safe so 
they (don't end up homeless again)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, a computer will re-enact the motions of San Francisco's 101 
California building, which had seismographs in its basement and on the 8th, 
24th and 48th floors. 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Brookes needed nothing fancy to tell her the building was shaking 
badly at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday -- even though the damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative assistant for Thomas A. Greene &amp; Co. Inc., which has 
offices on the 46th floor of the 101 California building, Brookes said, "All of 
a sudden, things started dancing all over my desk. Things started popping out 
of the ceiling. The doors opened. The drawers slid open." 
</P>
<P>
Crouched under her desk, she said, she had the feeling that the top of the 
building was making a slow arc from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like we were swinging in space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the quake, she and others who had been in the office began the long climb 
down 45 stories. 
</P>
<P>
About half way, she said, she met a woman who said she worked for a firm that 
analyzes how buildings perform in earthquakes. The woman told her that the 
building was one of the best in the state, as far as earthquake resistance was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it seemed miraculous that we weren't under the rubble," she said.

   Donald Trump claims he's not interested in the
Sears Tower, and the Japanese are wary of owning anything so
symbolic of America. But they'd all be there if a public auction
were held, says a man who wants to wield the gavel.
   Real estate auctioneer Joel Zegart is proposing that Sears,
Roebuck and Co. sell the world's tallest building at auction,
claiming that the nation's largest retailer would get the best price
that way.
   Sears announced Monday it would sell its famed 110-story
headquarters tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to
boost profits. The 14-year-old building, which rises 1,450 feet
above the downtown Loop, has been valued at up to $1.8 billion.
   Even those who say they're not interested _ like New York real
estate magnate Trump, several Japanese real estate firms, and JMB
Realty Corp., which owns Water Tower Place, the city's glitzy
downtown shopping complex _ are just playing coy, he believes.
   ``I think it's a smokescreen,'' Zegart, president of JBS &amp;
Associates Inc., said Wednesday of the many denials among those seen
as the most likely bidders for the building.
   ``I think a lot of people are interested and they just aren't
showing their cards yet.''
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the company had received
``a number of inquiries'' following its announcement, but he
wouldn't reveal the identities of the interested parties.
   Nor would Fairweather comment on the auction idea.
   ``I don't want to laugh on the record,'' he said.
   Fairweather said the sale, which is being handled by Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. in conjunction with Sears' own Coldwell Banker real
estate and Dean Witter Reynolds financial units, would be negotiated
privately with selected prospective buyers who would be invited to
submit bids.
   The skyscraper would continue to serve as corporate headquarters
for Sears, although the 8,000-employee Sears Merchandise Group would
be moved to smaller, less expensive facilities over the next several
years, leaving only about 600 Sears workers in the tower.
   Zegart, whose firm specializes in auctions of large investment
properties, said a public auction open to all would generate
tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest price Sears
could hope to receive.
   He said he would start the bidding at $800 million.
   Zegart, comparing the one-of-a-kind Sears Tower to the Mona Lisa,
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987
auction of Vincent van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was to the seller in
that case.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. stunned the art
world when it paid $40 million for ``Sunflowers'' in March 1987;
later in the year, an unidentified bidder paid even more for another
van Gogh.
   ``The Sears Tower is a building that you'll never see reproduced
again,'' Zegart said. ``You're buying a piece of Chicago when you
buy the Sears Tower. It's the gem of the downtown. It's history,
it's a landmark, it's known around the world.''
   Several Japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that
make them wary.
   ``Buying such a building is not the same as buying
`Sunflowers,''' Tokyo-based investment analyst Masahiko Muranaka
told the Chicago Tribune. ``This is like buying a piece of America's
heart.''
   The Trump Organization, which was also seen as a likely bidder
for the tower, ``is not interested in the Sears building,'' said
spokeswoman Norma Foerderer.
   And neither is JMB, one of the nation's largest real-estate
invesment firms, said spokeswoman Marion Jack.

<HEAD>Debris Hurled By High Wind Shatters Windows In Sears Tower

<TEXT>
   Wind gusting to more than 50 mph hurled debris
into windows at the Sears Tower early today, damaging 90 panes and
forcing police to close streets around the world's tallest
building, authorities said.
   But police said there were no reports of injuries from falling
glass.
   Initially, building officials reported that 19 windows were
broken and six others were cracked on the east and southeast sides
of the 110-story building, said Ernie Arms, a spokesman for Sears,
Roebuck and Co., whose corporate headquarters are in the building.
   A survey later in the morning by building engineers found that
90 windows were broken or cracked as the wind gusted to 56 mph, he
said.
   ``They're not blown out,'' Arms said. ``What happened is
something flying through the air _ like a pebble from the roof of
another building _ hit and broke one window and then others were
damaged as that one window came down.''
   The broken and cracked windows were located between the 50th and
88th floors and are among 16,000 windows in the 1,454-foot tall
building.
   Arms said authorities closed one entrance to the building,
leaving two others open. And police Patrolman Frank Daio said
authorities were forced to block traffic during the morning rush
hour on the four streets surrounding the building.

   How do you erect a 19-story building in New York
City?
   Start with a 31-story structure. Discover zoning prohibits a
building that big. Lose a three-year court battle. And receive an
order to lop 12 stories off.
   Welcome to 108 E. 96th St., the multi-million-dollar high-rise
set to shrink this month in the final act of a showdown between
local activists and its developer, Parkview Associates. David
defeated Goliath last week when the city ruled the 31-story edifice
must lose its top dozen floors.
   The decision will cost the developer about $10 million in
addition to the fought-over floors, leaving the building owners a
little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those
stories.
   ``We're going to take a while to digest this decision,'' said
Jay A. Segal, attorney for Parkview Associates. ``We won't make any
decision for a week or two.''
   The city last week also dealt with a second Manhattan building
found to be too tall. The 811-foot CitySpire project on West 54th
Street was erected 14 feet above what zoning ordinances allow.
   But officials spared the building a steel haircut. Developer Ian
Bruce Eichner won a compromise agreement in which he will build a
$2.5 million dance studio in return for a variance.
   Parkview's $10 million loss includes the cost of chopping off
the illegal floors, the income from the lost apartments and the
cost of the building's extended vacancy. The building remains
uninhabited; it would have been ready to open in late 1986.
   The odds don't look good for Parkview, which has unsuccessfully
taken its battle to preserve the high-rise to the city, local
court, state court and U.S. Supreme Court.
   The city rejected a Parkview proposal to build about 40
low-income senior citizen apartments in East Harlem in return for a
zoning variance leaving the building intact.
   Parkview has until April 27 to appeal its most recent loss; the
developer's last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that
the too-tall ruling was arbitrary and capricious, Segal said.
   Should Parkview decide not to appeal, the demolition will begin
posthaste after that date, said city Buildings Department spokesman
Vahe Tiryakian.
   ``They have 30 days to appeal, and we're obliged to give 'em
that,'' Tiryakian said. ``We'll have to wait and see what happens.''
   While the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12
floors, many residents of the well-to-do area couldn't be happier
about Tuesday's unanimous decision by the city Board of Standards
and Appeals.
   ``We're really very, very pleased. We feel that after this
almost three-year battle, this was the right result,'' said Genie
Rice, president of the local community group Civitas.
   It was Ms. Rice who first noticed the 31-story building violated
a 1973 regulation putting a 19-floor cap on the area's skyline.
Developer Albert Ginsburg, in getting a permit for the structure,
used an incorrect zoning map.
   When the error was discovered in 1986, workers had already
completed the building's concrete superstructure, installed
elevator shafts to the 27th floor and finished wiring and plumbing
for the first 24 stories.
   All that is due to come down now: workers would attack the top
12 floors as if taking down an old building, starting at the top
floor and dismantling things one story at a time.
   When the work is completed, Ms. Rice said, residents of the new
building will be greeted by some very happy neighbors.
   ``As far as we're concerned, we're ready to celebrate the
opening of a new 19-story building,'' Ms. Rice said after the
board's decision. ``That would be wonderful.''

ARCHITECTURE CRITICS CALL DOWNTOWN'S NEWEST 'ORDINARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If only they had stayed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
From there the city's skyline, recently crowned by the tallest building on the 
West Coast, looked good enough to a group of visiting architecture critics who 
gathered here Saturday to survey the city's latest attempts to beautify its 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Up close, however, it was the same old story. Downtown Los Angeles, long a 
target of disdain by Eastern critics, took it in the chops once again. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary," said Michael Sorkin of the Village Voice. "We're living in a fairly 
exciting time. There are some exciting propositions out there," he said, 
referring to buildings in other cities. "How come none of them are appearing 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Developer Driven' 
</P>
<P>
Robert Campbell of the Boston Globe replied that certain extraordinary cities, 
such as Paris, are full of ordinary buildings, but he seemed to find little 
about this city's latest face-lift to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that the downtown's newest and proudest achievement, the 73-story 
First Interstate World Center, made for "a pretty eloquent form on the skyline" 
but from street level was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like what I see so far," Campbell said of the building's unfinished 
base. 
</P>
<P>
John Pastier of Architecture Magazine described the building as "developer 
driven," a structure whose shape was determined by financial considerations. 
For two-thirds of the way up, Pastier said, the building lacks distinction, its 
shape determined by the need for a large, uniform floor plan. Only toward the 
top, where the contours begin to change, does the building have some interest, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics on the panel were Diana Ketcham of the Oakland Tribune and 
Suzanne Stephens, the panel's moderator, a former editor of Progressive 
Architecture and now a teacher of architectural criticism at Barnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, none of whom work for local newspapers, were invited here by LA 
Architect, the publication of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute 
of Architects. The critics, joined by the architects of three of the buildings 
under discussion, took part in a daylong symposium titled "Critics and Cranes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Island of New Construction 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium was to focus on an island of new construction, 
surrounding the Central Library at 5th Street and Grand Avenue, which the city 
hopes will become a model for a prettier and livelier downtown. The 
neighborhood is important for a number of reasons. With the Biltmore and the 
library, it boasts two of the city's most valued historic buildings. The area 
is situated between Bunker Hill and Pershing Square and is seen as a link 
between the downtown's old and new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
When all of the construction is complete, the neighborhood will be festooned 
with kiosks, plazas, open-air cafes, an outdoor stairway and other gathering 
places that planners hope will draw people from all walks of life and end the 
segregation that has made the area around Pershing Square a sort of Maginot 
Line between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the buildings discussed at the symposium are complete or near 
completion. They are First Interstate World Center, which was designed by 
architect I.M. Pei, and the Biltmore Tower, a commercial addition to the 
Biltmore Hotel designed by Thomas H. Landau of the Landau Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium also focused on Norman Pfeiffer's design for the ongoing 
expansion of the Central Library and on the California Gas Tower. The architect 
of that 54-story building, which is barely under way, is Richard C. Keating of 
Skidmore, Owings and Merill. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, Pfeiffer and Landau attended the symposium. They discussed their 
buildings but, for the most part, did not debate the critics. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the critics, Ketcham of the Oakland Tribune, said that 
preservation of the Central Library had loomed too large on the architectural 
agenda and that the public's demand for faithfulness to the design of the 
original library perhaps had inhibited creativity in the immediate 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"When so much of the thinking about what is to be built next is colored by 
sentimentality over preservation, it can lead to architects feeling that they 
have to build background buildings," she said.

BRAND BOULEVARD REVIVAL RAISING GLENDALE SKYLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited revival of Glendale's Brand Boulevard is under way, but the 
ground-hugging street of the past is being transformed into a high-rise 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Construction has started on what will be the city's tallest building, as well 
as a mid-rise office/retail/entertainment complex near the massive Glendale 
Galleria. The long-vacant 4-acre site north of the Galleria will be home to a 
twin-tower complex being developed by a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the only remnant of Brand's previous life as the city's major 
north-south retail street will be its distinctive diagonal parking. 
</P>
<P>
This spurt of construction activity should reinforce Glendale's position as the 
third-ranking financial center in California, behind Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, according to William R. Boyd of the Glendale office of Coldwell 
Banker Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Financial service companies, including thrifts and insurance companies, occupy 
about 40% of the 3.14 million square feet of office space in Glendale," Boyd 
said. "An additional 40% is taken by service businesses, including law firms 
and accountants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacant Lot Question 
</P>
<P>
Last week's approval of Glendale City Center by the Glendale Redevelopment 
Agency answers those who had wondered: "What's going to be built in that vacant 
lot north of the Glendale Galleria?" 
</P>
<P>
The more than $150-million, 790,000-square-foot office/retail project will be 
constructed, beginning in September, in the block bounded by Brand Boulevard on 
the east, Broadway on the south, Orange Street on the west and Wilson Avenue on 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
A project of Homart Development Co., a subsidiary of Sears, Glendale City 
Center will feature twin office towers separated by an elaborate landscaped 
courtyard, according to Gino Rossetti, president of Rossetti Associates, Santa 
Monica, the architects. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-story tower will be built in the first phase atop a parking/retail 
structure, followed by a 22-story tower north of it in the second phase, 
Rossetti said. The leasing agent for Glendale City Center is the Glendale 
office of Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from Glendale City Center, construction has started on Brand 
Passage, the first of two elements of The Exchange, a $50-million mixed-use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22-Story Building 
</P>
<P>
The Exchange, designed by the Feola/Deenihan Partnership AIA, Glendale, 
occupies two blocks bounded by Brand Boulevard, Wilson Avenue, Louise Street 
and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
About three blocks north of The Exchange, construction is under way with a May, 
1990, completion on 500 N. Brand, a 22-story, 423,000-square-foot office tower 
by a joint venture of the Glendale-based Howard-Platz Group, Glendale 
Properties and General Electric Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The $110-million 500 N. Brand is reportedly the largest 100% speculative office 
building under construction in the Southland, according to Richard Dunn of the 
Charles Dunn Co., the leasing agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20% Vacancy Level 
</P>
<P>
"In an office market running at a 20% vacancy level, Glendale is now 
approaching the single-digit range," Dunn added. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Ellerbe Beckett, Santa Monica, the 332-foot-high granite-clad tower 
at Brand Boulevard and Milford Street will be Glendale's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
The building will have 18,500 square feet of retail space in a two-story 
pavilion. There will be three levels of below-grade parking, along with five 
levels above ground. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in December, Brand Passage by the Howard-Platz Group 
is a four-story building at 130 N. Brand Blvd. with about 15,000 square feet of 
retail space, 40,000 square feet of offices and an 8,500-square-foot multilevel 
courtyard. The mixed-use development will extend street to street from Brand 
east to Maryland Avenue. The leasing agent is Dorn Platz &amp; Co., Glendale. 
The contractor is Rowland Constructors, Phoenix, with tenant improvements by 
Howard Building Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin in mid-May on the second increment of The 
Exchange, an eight-screen Mann Theater complex by Brand Development Co. at 130 
N. Maryland Ave. The three-level complex will be highlighted -- literally -- by 
a 22-foot diameter antique, lighted glass dome that will be visible from many 
locations in downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the eight auditoriums will have a Lucas THX sound system, and several 
will be have 70-mm. projection systems. The complex is scheduled for a 
first-quarter 1990 opening. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency is building a 742-space parking structure -- 
scheduled for completion in June -- adjacent to The Exchange, according to a 
spokeswoman for the agency. Feola/Deenihan is the architect for the structure.

   Financing difficulties brought on by debt have
delivered a blow to John C. Portman's reputation, but the Atlanta
architect-developer's lieutenants say obituaries are premature.
   Despite the recent series of emergency meetings with creditors
over Portman's unsecured loans, officials of The Portman Cos.
maintain their operation is strong and its ventures are moving full
steam ahead.
   ``We've been in business 30 years and will be in business 30
more. The financing on our major projects is firmly in place. There
is no threat to the concrete and steel buildings of the Portman
Companies,'' executive vice president Sam Williams said Wednesday,
following the latest session with creditors.
   Williams said the focus of the meetings is to create a pool of
collateral to back the company's unsecured loans - those that are
not supported by assets or other collateral. He said he expected an
agreement to be reached within two weeks.
   Williams said Portman has no intention of backing out of any of
his current projects, though some, notably a 60-story office tower
in downtown Atlanta, are going up under less than ideal
circumstances.
   The Atlanta venture, to be called One Peachtree Center and
designed as the tallest skyscraper in the South, has been launched
amid a period of rising vacancy rates in the city's office
buildings.
   Williams argued that the severity of the downtown office vacancy
situation has been inflated because most calculations have factored
in two other skyscraper projects that have since been abandoned.
   Another major Atlanta office building, 191 Peachtree Tower, is
under construction now and nearing completion. Williams contends
that the Portman project, currently in its early stages of
construction, will be in a prime position as the newest kid on the
block when it opens in 1991.
   ``In essence, we now have the market position of the only new
office tower in downtown Atlanta with space available,'' Williams
said. ``Real estate, like any other business, goes in cycles. ...
Who's to say what cycle we will be in in the third quarter of 1995?
Our crystal ball is not that good but we've been through real
estate storms before.''
   Portman, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has
been on the defensive before, though rarely for his business
acumen.
   His architectural style, marked by streamlined exteriors and
expansive indoor atriums, have tended to be popular among the
masses but maligned by critics, who accused Portman of building
urban fortresses.
   Portman has steadfastly defended his modernist architecture as
``for people and not things.''
   After building his Peachtree Center cluster of office towers,
hotels and trade marts in downtown Atlanta, Portman went on to
major projects in cities including New York, San Francisco and
Singapore.
   As the real estate market began to slump over the last three
years, however, Portman borrowed heavily and refinanced existing
projects to launch new ventures.
   Among his new developments are the $300 million One Peachtree
Center; the $155 million Inforum technology mart, which opened last
year in Atlanta; the $90 million San Francisco Fashion Center,
which opened during the summer; and the $195 million Shanghai
Center, an office-hotel-retail complex opening next month in China.
   Portman's operation is private and does not release financial
data, though his current debt load has been reported to be more
than $1.6 billion.
   He has been sued recently by DG Bank Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank for allegedly failing to make a $3 million loan
repayment. And on Sept. 1 he stopped making payments to one of his
main creditors, Equitable Life Assurances Society of the United
States, on a $332.6 million mortgage for his flagship Peachtree
Center complex in Atlanta.
   Williams said the company's problems are only with unsecured
creditors, who hold about 5 percent of the company's loans. A
spokesman for Equitable this week declined to comment on the talks
with Portman, though two other creditors, CitiBank and Swiss Bank
Corp., said ``positive progress'' was made at the latest meeting.
   The 65-year-old Portman has made some bold architectural and
business decisions during his career, but publicly has maintained a
reticent image. He makes few public appearances, except to announce
new developments.
   Yet the talks with creditors have made him a reluctant front
page item over the last month. It is a position, say some who are
close to Portman, that the businessman doesn't like.
   Insurance executive Jesse Hill Jr., a friend of Portman, charged
that much of the media coverage has been based on speculation and
has weakened Portman's position in negotiating with the bankers.
   ``The man is obviously restructuring his finances,'' said Hill,
president of Atlanta Life Insurance Co. ``He's in negotiations and
if somehow the press wouldn't give him this terrible beating, he
has the assets and under normal circumstances he could work it
out.''
   Hill said he was especially offended by those who have grouped
Portman with New York developer Donald Trump and other high-flying
1980s entrepreneurs whose debt-financed empires have taken a dive
in the new decade.
   ``There is some constant effort to compare John Portman to
Donald Trump,'' Hill said. ``Trump is no John Portman, and Portman
is no Trump.
   ``Portman is a Horatio Alger story. He didn't have a Rockefeller
Center - he built one. The man is in a class by himself.''
   B. Eugene Griessman, a professor in the college of management at
Portman's alma mater, Georgia Tech, profiled the
architect-developer for a 1987 book on achievers. He said it is
Portman's nature to brush aside such obstacles when he has his mind
set on a project.
   ``He's a risk taker. His next project is always his favorite,''
said Griessman.
   Williams said Portman's current problems stem from tightened
banking regulations that have followed the real estate slump and
the savings and loan crisis. Banks are requiring lenders to come up
with stronger backing for loans, he said.
   ``Almost every real estate company in America will have to deal
with it,'' he said.

The Beijing-owned Bank of China opened for business in Hong Kong last week in a 
70-story, prism-shaped skyscraper that dominates the city's skyline and has 
sparked superstitious worries among residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,289-foot-tall skyscraper, designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. 
Pei, is the tallest building in the British colony, which is to be handed back 
to the Communist mainland in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's four right-angled triangular prisms, placed together to form 
a long, thin square column topped by twin antennas, have been condemned by many 
of the territory's superstitious residents. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars of fung shui -- literally the study of wind and water -- say the 
building's design is a sure sign of bad luck. The sharp edges on the 
interlocking triangles that make up the sides of the building are said to be 
like daggers, the twin antennas that top off the tower like empty chopsticks. 
Both symbols are bad omens, according to fung shui. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the more superstitious residents living near the building have hung 
small mirrors outside their windows to reflect the tower's bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The project ran eight months behind schedule and millions of dollars over 
budget.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced it has
reached agreement with a Boston property investment firm to
refinance the Sears Tower, the world's tallest building and the
retailer's corporate headquarters.
   The $850 million refinancing deal delays a sale of the 110-story
skyscraper in downtown Chicago for at least 15 years.
   AEW Partners, a limited partnership managed by Aldrich, Eastman
&amp; Waltch Inc., will finance a 15-year mortgage on the tower and
related properties and have an option to buy the building, Sears
said in a news release.
   The deal will produce net proceeds of $815 million for Sears,
the nation's largest retailer, which had contemplated selling the
Chicago landmark. Sears said it expects to close the deal by the
middle of next summer.
   The company said that ``as a result of lower interest rates and
the positive long-term prospects for the commercial real-estate
market, this financing transaction offers more net cash and
attractive features than alternative structures.''
   Just over a year ago, Sears announced its intention to sell the
15-year-old tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to
halt a slide in its profitability.
   The restructuring, which brought major changes in the retailer's
merchandising and pricing policies, also included moving Sears'
retail division headquarters from the tower to an office complex
that will be built in suburban Hoffman Estates.
   Sears began exploring the refinancing option in September after
a prospective sale of the 1,707-foot building to Canadian developer
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. collapsed. The two reportedly
couldn't agree on which party would pay the increased property
taxes certain to result from a reassessment of the property after a
sale.
   The failed deal with Olympia &amp; York was reportedly for $1
billion. When Sears first announced plans to sell the building,
real-estate experts had speculated it would fetch $1.2 billion to
$2 billion.
