   WELLINGTON


A US-New Zealand consortium has paid NZDollars 328m (USDollars 179m) for New
Zealand Rail. It plans eventually to float some of the company - possibly 40
per cent - on the local stock market.
Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's minister of finance, said the deal, which
includes the inter-island ferry service but excludes NZ Rail running track,
is after NZDollars 62m of debt repayment.
The consortium consists of Wisconsin Central Transportation, the biggest
railway operator in the US, Berkshire Partners of Boston, a US equity
investment group, and Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank.
Fay, Richwhite said the flotation was planned for 1996 at the earliest once
NZ Rail was able to demonstrate a consistent earnings performance under
private ownership. Last year it made an after-tax profit of NZDollars 36.3m.
Wisconsin Central operates across 2,000 miles of track in the US and Canada.
Mr Ed Burkhardt, president, said his company intended to remain a long term
investor in NZ Rail which would roughly double the size of Wisconsin
Central.
He said there were similarities, as his company's focus was on the haulage
of forestry, coal, pulp and paper and dairy products.
Mr Burkhardt said employee numbers at NZ Rail were 5,000, down from 27,000
in 1984. He said that while Wisconsin Central had 1,050 staff the companies
were different. His company did not run a large ferry service or passenger
trains which were more labour intensive.
The New Zealand government will retain the right to introduce another
operator on the railway line if freight and passenger traffic falls below 50
per cent of current volumes.
Ms Richardson said NZ Rail would continue to receive a government subsidy at
around the current level of NZDollars 28m a year. NZR also receives a
regional bodies subsidy. She said these would assure continuation of the
passenger service. NZ Rail would need a NZDollars 600m capital injection by
the end of the decade and another NZDollars 800m by 2010.

In response to Mr. Wollersheim's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 781, in the 



Federal Register



 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49949), proposing the establishment of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The notice
requested comments from all interested persons by October 25, 1993. 







Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 







Seven comments were received concerning the proposal to establish the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. All seven
commenters stated that they fully support the proposed area as delineated in Notice No. 781. One of the commenters
was under the mistaken impression that this area had been proposed to be called the Roxbury Viticultural District.
However, despite the misunderstanding about the name, this commenter stated in his letter that he heartily supports
the establishment of a new viticultural area in this part of Wisconsin which includes the Wollersheim Winery. 







Viticultural Area Name 







The place-name ``Lake Wisconsin'' was first used ca. 1917 to describe a widened section of the Wisconsin River that
was submerged when the Baraboo hydroelectric dam was constructed one mile upriver from the town of Prairie-du-Sac.
A travel brochure and map produced by the Lake Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce in 1989, entitled Lake Wisconsin Chamber
Recreation Area Vacationland, shows various recreational and tourist facilities in the Lake Wisconsin viticultural
area. The viticultural area has a long history of wine grape growing and wine making activity. Agoston Haraszthy,
an immigrant from Hungary well known as an early pioneer in the American wine industry, first planted wine grapes on
Wollersheim Winery property in 1847. Cold winter temperatures frustrated this early attempt to establish grapevines
and two years later Haraszthy moved to California. However, wine grape growing and wine making continued in this area
until 1900. Because of its role in the early history of Wisconsin, Wollersheim Winery and the adjacent homestead were
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. 







Evidence of Boundaries 







The boundaries of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area are clearly shown on two U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps, Sauk City,
Wisc. and Lodi, Wisc. The Sauk City, Wisc. quadrangle map shows the viticultural area to be bounded by the shoreline
of Lake Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. The southern boundary is defined by Mack Road and State
Highway Y, and the eastern boundary, shown on the Lodi, Wisc. quadrangle map, follows State Highway Y, State Highway
60, State Highway 113, and Spring Creek. The petitioner states that some of the natural boundary features, which closely
approximate some of the roads and highways used as boundaries for this viticultural area, can be found on county maps,
plat maps and county atlases dating back to 1861. 







Geographical Features 







The Wisconsin River (of which Lake Wisconsin is a part) is a major natural feature of the State and of the region. It is
the largest river in the State after the Mississippi River, of which it is a major tributary. Roads and highways define
the southern boundary of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The landscape of the viticultural area is comprised
of discontinuous end moraines interspersed with ground moraines and occasional outwash plains. The landscape outside
the southern boundary is of higher elevation and is comprised of rolling, hummocky upland with some outwash material.
The eastern boundary, which closely approximates Spring Creek, identifies an area of low relief, continuous and
intermittent stream drainage, and marsh. To the east of Spring Creek and outside the viticultural area is a glaciated
upland plain where the landscape is generally of higher elevations and comprised of end moraines with little or no
outwash material.

   MILWAUKEE


WISCONSIN'S primary today may prove a closer contest than New York's for the
two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination,
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Governor Jerry Brown of
California.
Mr Brown held an early advantage, gaining from some early visits to the
state while Mr Clinton was still concentrating money and time on New York.
Local opinion polls, however, have produced wide variations: a poll from St
Norbert College Survey Center, in Green Bay, showed Mr Clinton ahead with 44
per cent of the vote, to 33 per cent for Mr Brown, but a later sampling by
Mason-Dixon, a Washington-based research group, reversed this picture, with
46 per cent for Mr Brown and 37 per cent for Mr Clinton.
Private polling by the two campaigns suggest the ballot could be very close
and both candidates took quick breaks from New York to campaign in Wisconsin
on Friday. Mr Clinton left his wife, Hillary, behind to represent him at a
state Democratic party dinner, while Mr Brown's 83-year-old mother, Bernice,
flew in to help her son.
Wisconsin has played a critical role in many presidential elections. In
1944, it killed off the candidacy of Mr Wendell Wilkie and, in 1976, it
helped Mr Jimmy Carter head off the challenge of Mr Morris Udall. But
Wisconsin is also unusual political territory, drawing on its Germanic roots
to devise its own brand of activist and scrupulously honest politics, a
brand which found its expression in Mr Robert LaFollette, who was elected
governor in 1900 and then went on to the Senate before running for president
in 1924.
'What makes Wisconsin a little bit unusual is its old progressive populist
tradition, which has always appreciated the renegade outsider who wants to
run against the system. Clean politics, clean government, that has always
been a tradition here,' says Professor John Johannes of Marquette
University, in Milwaukee. This tradition ought to benefit Mr Brown, but
Wisconsin has also often helped somewhat more conservative Democratic
candidates. It favoured Mr John Kennedy over the more liberal Mr Hubert
Humphrey in 1960, and Mr Michael Dukakis over the Rev Jesse Jackson in 1988.
Wisconsin has also elected, in the person of Governor Tommy Thompson,
perhaps the most activist Republican governor in the country, and appears to
have swung behind his often controversial experiments in welfare reform.
As in so many states previously, Mr Clinton has assured himself of the
backing of most of Wisconsin's Democratic hierarchy, from the chairman of
the state party, Mr Jeffrey Neubauer - who describes Mr Brown as 'a
charlatan' - to former Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson.
Clinton campaign managers in Milwaukee also say they have received a
substantial boost from Senator Tom Harkin from the neighbouring state of
Iowa, who threw his weight behind Mr Clinton after abandoning his own
candidacy. But Mr Brown has become skilled at the political ju-jitsu of
turning his rival's strengths to his own advantage, by depicting such
endorsements as proof that Mr Clinton is the candidate of the status quo.
Neither candidate, however, has captured Wisconsin's imagination, and their
duel has aroused far less passion than the concurrent elections for mayor of
Milwaukee and judge of the county court.
Nor have Mr Brown or Mr Clinton overcome the widespread distrust of
politicians that has marked this election year.
'We have our politicians and we have our murderers. They're all together,
same difference,' said a waitress at Schuster's Family Restaurant in
Milwaukee.
She knows something about both species, for she counted among her regular
customers, until he was elected senator and went off to Washington, Mr Herb
Kohl, owner of a Wisconsin supermarket chain and of Milwaukee's less than
spectacular basketball team; and also Mr Jeffrey Dahmer, until he went to
prison for at least 17 grisly murders - one of them Schuster's third-shift
cook.
Wisconsin boasts one of the most active and serious electorates in the
country. Turnout is typically 10 to 12 percentage points higher than the
national average, and even in primaries voters have tended to favour
electable candidates, rather than using their votes to send a general
message of discontent.
This time, however, the protest vote could be a factor to be reckoned with.
'Voters are resigned to the fact that Clinton is going to win the nomination
so they can afford to be reckless,' concludes Prof Johannes.

MIDWESTERNERS DIG OUT PARKAS AS SNOW MAKES WINTRY ENCORE 




From Associated Press 




Residents of Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan traded swimsuits and garden hoes 
for parkas and snow shovels Thursday as a freak storm brought back winter in 
May. 


The spring shocker was worst in Wisconsin, where snowfall of up to 8 inches 
shattered records for late-season snow. 


Some communities had to reassemble snowplows already stored for the season. 
Residents who had broken out the lawn furniture and headed for the beach just 
two days before, when temperatures reached the 70s and 80s, dug their coats out 
of mothballs. 


In Marquette, Mich., police officer Ron Michelson said: "I had my lounge out. 
It's still sitting on the porch getting full of snow." 


The Wisconsin storm, accompanied by wind up to 30 m.p.h., was blamed for 
hundreds of accidents and two traffic deaths. Downed power lines caused 
blackouts in more than 40,000 homes. 


Weather service specialist Edmond Lowe said the snow broke a 5-inch record that 
had stood since April 30, 1907. The latest spring snow ever in Wisconsin was 
May 31, 1889. 


In Hartford, a city of 7,000, Mayor Dean Kirley declared a state of emergency, 
ordering residents off streets and advising businesses and schools to close. 


In Illinois, more than 4 inches of snow fell Wednesday night and Thursday 
morning on Chicago's northwest suburbs.

*Indicates HSWA Requirement.



 





EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of 

permits, that contain conditions based upon the federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization,
and which were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization. EPA has previously suspended issuance
of permits for the other provisions on January 31, 1986, June 6, 1989, January 22, 1990, April 24, 1992, and August 2,
1993, the effective dates of Wisconsin's final authorization for the RCRA base program, and for subsequent program
revisions. 



Wisconsin is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian 

lands. This authority remains with EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation. 







C. Decision 







I conclude that Wisconsin's program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Accordingly, EPA grants
Wisconsin final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Wisconsin currently has responsibility
for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of
the RCRA program and its amendments. Wisconsin also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains
the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008,
3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 







D. Codification in Part 272 







EPA incorporates by reference authorized State programs in Part 272 of 40 CFR to provide notice to the public of the
scope of the authorized program in each State. Incorporation by reference of the Wisconsin program will be completed
at a later date. 







Compliance with Executive Order 12866 







The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

[FRL&hyph;5027&hyph;4] 





Wisconsin: Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program 






AGENCY:



 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




 






ACTION:



 Immediate final rule. 
















SUMMARY:



 Wisconsin has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed
Wisconsin's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these hazardous waste
program revisions satisfy all the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends
to grant final authorization to Wisconsin to operate its expanded program, subject to authority retained by EPA under
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter HSWA).




 




EFFECTIVE DATE:



 Final authorization for Wisconsin shall be effective on October 4, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior 



Federal Register



 (FR) action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Wisconsin's final authorization must be received
by 4:30 p.m. central time on September 6, 1994. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal
of this immediate final rule or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment which either affirms that the immediate
final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.




 




ADDRESSES:



 Copies of Wisconsin's final Authorization Revision Application are available from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., at the following
addresses for inspection and copying: Mr. Al Matano, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, 101 S. Webster,
Third Floor, Madison, Wisconsin 53707, Phone 608/267&hyph;3531; Ms. Margaret Millard, U.S. EPA Region V, Office
of RCRA, 77 W. Jackson, Seventh Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60604, Phone 312/353&hyph;1440. Written comments should
be sent to Ms. Margaret Millard, U.S. EPA Region V, Office of RCRA, 77 W. Jackson (HRM&hyph;7J), Chicago, Illinois,
60604, Phone 312/353&hyph;1440.







FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Margaret Millard, Wisconsin Regulatory Specialist, U.S. EPA Region V, HRM&hyph;7J,
77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604, (312) 353&hyph;1440.




 




SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background 





States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 

6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with,
and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 

In accordance with 40 CFR 271.21, revisions to State hazardous waste 

programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other
changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR
Parts 124, 260&hyph;266, 268, and 270. 





B. Wisconsin 





Wisconsin initially received final authorization for its program effective January 31, 1986 (51 



FR



 3783). Subsequently, Wisconsin received authorization for revisions to its program, which became effective on
June 6, 1989 (54 



FR



 22278), January 22, 1990 (54 



FR



 48243), April 24, 1992 (57 



FR 



15029), and August 2, 1993 (58 



FR



 31344). On March 16, 1994, Wisconsin submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals.
Today, Wisconsin is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 

EPA reviewed Wisconsin's application, and has made an immediate final 

decision that Wisconsin's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify
for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications
to Wisconsin. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until September 6, 1994.
Copies of Wisconsin's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations
indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 

Approval of Wisconsin's program revision shall become effective in 60 

days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of
the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final
decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 

On October 4, 1994, (unless EPA publishes a prior FR action withdrawing this immediate final rule), Wisconsin will
be authorized to carry out, in lieu of the Federal program, those provisions of the State's program which are analogous
to the following provisions of the Federal program:

   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, tells
an amusing story about fund raising in the US. Arriving at Madison, the
capital of Wisconsin State, Smith and colleagues are searching in their bags
for the address of the fund managers they are due to see that day, when the
taxi driver interjects: 'I know where you are heading. This is Madison,
Wisconsin.
'The only thing in town is the pension fund. If you are in there for less
than an hour, you've had it, more than an hour and you are in with a
chance.'
Over the last 18 months, UK venture capital fund managers have been tripping
over each other in some of the furthest flung corners of the US.
From Wisconsin's pension fund in the north to the giant California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers), corridors have echoed to the honeyed
tones of salesmen trying to convince investors their track record is better
than the next fund manager who will walk in through the door.
Mostly, their efforts have been successful. In spite of clocking up many
more air miles than they had wanted, Charterhouse Capital Partners,
Candover, Schroder, Legal &amp; General and Morgan Grenfell have successfully
raised more than Pounds 1bn of new capital this year, much of it from US
investors.
As Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover says, raising capital has taken a lot
longer than for previous funds. Some smaller outlets may also have also been
pleasantly surprised that, notwithstanding the additional effort, they have
raised new funds.
Eighteen months ago few in the industry would have bet on some of these
funds raising much fresh capital. Their life raft has been the strong burst
of flotations in the UK that began last year and transformed the performance
of some funds that would otherwise have looked decidedly worse for wear.
Unfortunately for venture capitalists who had hoped to spend less time
travelling to raise funds, UK institutions' appetite has been dulled by the
roller-coaster performance over the last five years.
'The underlying appetite is still there,' says one active UK investor in
private equity funds. 'But there is a greater degree of cynicism about the
claims of fund managers. I think that the proliferation of professional
venture capital managers which we saw until four years ago won't recur for
some time.'
But the pilgrimage to the US is not driven only by the scarcity of capital
elsewhere. Bob Johnston, president of Beacon Hill Financial, a Boston-based
agency that specialises in raising funds, says there has been a steady
growth in the number of investors interested in what used to be known as
'alternative investments.'
These institutions - some of them big hitters such as Calpers with Dollars
80bn under management - are allocating fixed percentages of an increasing
asset base to unquoted investments.
'What is attracting the US investors is the good news coming from the UK
economy,' says Johnston. 'But there is a surprising amount being raised for
MBOs.'
The real newcomers are the state pension funds and increased activity by
institutions like Harvard, Yale and the Andrew Mellon Foundation. Corporate
pension funds first moved into overseas quoted investments in the mid-1980s,
followed five years ago by the state pension funds.
'Now public pension funds are following corporate funds again,' says
Johnston. 'That is why there is an increase in the amount of dollars
available for unquoted investment.'
This has led to another development. Many of these investors will only put
large sums in venture capital funds. Investing in small amounts makes little
sense for a group such as Calpers. As a result, more funds are being raised
by fewer fund managers.
The same phenomenon is apparent in the US market. Some observers say this
concentration could increase competition for larger buy-out and late stage
development capital deals, forcing down targeted returns, pushing up the
amount of debt in each deal or both.
Howard Cox, general partner at Greylock, the long established Boston-based
venture capital firm, disagrees: 'If there is more money available, it can
encourage opportunities, he says. 'The question is the quality of the deal
flow.'
Another dissenter is Alan Patricof, chairman of Patricof and Co, the US
member of Apax Partners. He says there is no shortage of quality deals.
'The level of disbursements of venture capital funds has consistently run
under or close to the amount of money raised,' Patricof says.
For the fund raiser, however, one thing is certain. Fund managers will
increasingly have to prove their track record or they will not get past the
gatekeepers, the intermediaries who screen and rank the funds and their
mangers for investing institutions.
'You really have to have a track record and it really has to check out,'
says Robert Smith.
'Five years ago we were selling dreams and there was absolutely no track
record. Now these gatekeepers really do know who we are and have comparative
industry statistics for closed end funds.'
Inevitably, the arrival of gatekeepers has increased the length of time  -
and therefore the cost - of raising a fund. Johnston says it now takes up to
a year, double what it took five years ago.
'They investigated investee companies, they looked at our performance
numbers, our reference checks with banks and accountants,' says Stephen
Curran, chief executive of Candover.
For those funds who can show their quality, the US is likely to remain an
attractive source of capital, as long as deal structures remain
conservative.
As the industry matures, however, managers with poorer performances will no
longer be able to rely on a silver tongue and a winning smile.

NATION IN BRIEF; 


WISCONSIN; 


APOLOGY ISSUED FOR MASSACRE OF INDIANS 




From Times staff and Wire reports 




Sac and Fox Indians received an apology from Wisconsin for the 1832 Bad Axe 
Massacre during which hundreds of their tribal predecessors were killed while 
trying to flee white pursuers. "I thank you, sir," Elmer Manatowa of Stroud, 
Okla., chief of the Sac-Fox nation told a state legislator who presented a 
proclamation of apology from the Wisconsin Assembly during a ceremony at the 
battle site near Victory, Wis. Known as the Black Hawk War, the pursuit of the 
fleeing Indians and the riverside massacre by soldiers, state militia and 
settlers was described as "one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad history of 
American-Indian relations."

St., Oshkosh, Wisconsin, TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,544C 164 W. 28th St., Oshkosh, Wisconsin.










In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 29, 1994, applicable to all workers of Oshkosh B'
Gosh's facilities at McKenzie, Tennessee; 2660 Oregon Street and 2748 Oregon Street in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Notice
was published in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17570).



The Department reviewed the certification for the workers of the subject firm. New findings show that two distribution
centers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin (2728 Oregon St and 164 W. 28th Avenue) which handle mostly domestic corporate merchandise
from McKenzie and Camden Tennessee and Oshkosh, Wisconsin closed in September, 1994. The Camden plant was certified
under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,622.



The intent of the Department's certification is to handle all workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh who were affected by increased
imports of children's and men's workwear bibs, jackets and jeans. 



The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,543 and 29,544 is hereby issued as follows:










All workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh, McKenzie, Tennessee (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,543), who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after January 31, 1993 and all workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh 2660 Oregon Street (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,544);
2748 Oregon Street (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,544A); 2728 Oregon Street (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,544B) and 164 W. 28th Avenue
(TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,544C) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin who become totally or partially separated from employment on or
after February 15, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.










Signed at Washington, DC, this 14th day of November 1994.

NAMES IN THE NEWS; 


UECKER BACK TO PITCH WISCONSIN 




From Times Wire Services 




MADISON, Wis. 




Sportsman and actor Bob Uecker will be the head pitchman in Wisconsin's annual 
effort to attract spring and summer tourism. 


The former Milwaukee Braves baseball player -- better known for his appearances 
in commercials -- agreed to donate his services to the 1990 campaign, as he has 
in the past, officials announced Thursday. 


One of the advertising agencies involved in the project suggested dumping 
Uecker this year, but the state Tourism Council, mindful of the success of 
previous campaigns, decided to use him again. 


"Record responses for Wisconsin tourism information came as the result of past 
Uecker spots," said Richard Matty, administrator of the state Division of 
Tourism Development. 


Uecker broadcasts Milwaukee Brewers games.

EYE PROBLEMS CLOUD PRYOR'S COMEBACK; 


BOXING: WISCONSIN AGREES TO SANCTION BOUT EVEN THOUGH FORMER CHAMPION HAS 
UNDERGONE SURGERY FOR A DETACHED RETINA AND HAS CATARACTS IN HIS LEFT EYE. 




From Associated Press 




MILWAUKEE 




Former junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor, his career shadowed by serious 
eye and drug problems, said Wednesday he has no fear of losing his sight if he 
returns to the ring next week to fight Daryl Jones. 


But boxing officials in states which had refused Pryor a license because he had 
undergone surgery for a detached retina and has cataracts clouding his left eye 
criticized Wisconsin's decision to let him fight. 


"In Pryor's case, if you go into the ring with one eye, you'd better be 
prepared to get a guide dog," said Don Muse, assistant executive director of 
the California State Athletic Commission. 


"We won't even let fighters fight here with detached retinas. Not too long ago, 
we blocked an exhibition bout by Sugar Ray Leonard at a shopping center because 
he had a detached retina." 


But Pryor, a junior welterweight champion from 1980-85 before his career was 
scuttled by drug problems, said he proved in a December exhibition against 
former Olympian Howard Davis that he is ready to return to the ring. 


"Howard Davis has the fastest hands in boxing. It proved that I can see and I'm 
ready to fight," said Pryor, who had planned to face Hector Comacho in Las 
Vegas for a much larger payday. 


"I'm disappointed I got turned down in Vegas," said Pryor, who hasn't fought 
since beating Herminio Morales with a third-round knockout in December of 1988. 
"Wisconsin spelled out the difference between a fighter having a handicap and 
being disabled. I think Vegas should take that into consideration." 


Randy Gordon, chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, said he would 
start sending faxes to Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson to stop the fight that is 
scheduled for May 16 at the Masonic Temple in Madison. Pryor is under 
suspension in New York until he passes an eye test. 


"Without sounding hysterical, I believe that we the commission and the media 
almost have to appeal to the governor of Wisconsin for a stay of execution for 
Aaron Pryor," Gordon said. 


"This is bad for boxing and bad for the state of Wisconsin," said Dr. James 
Nave, chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission which voted 4-1 last 
month not to allow Pryor to box in that state. "We spent a tremendous amount of 
time researching this case and I don't think Wisconsin looked at what we 
researched before coming to our decision." 


The Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing granted Pryor a license 
after he signed a statement that he understood the risks, and he absolved the 
state of any liability if he's hurt. 


The state of Wisconsin considers his cataracts a condition of handicap rather 
than a medical condition, and the state has strict laws against discrimination 
against the handicapped. Pryor underwent testing by a physician and an 
ophthamologist in Wisconsin before getting approval on Monday to box. 


Marlene Cummings, secretary of regulation licensing, said Wednesday that Dr. 
Suresh Chandra, a Madison ophthamologist, examined Pryor and reported that 
"there is some impairment." 


"But he is not legally blind. He said the choice should be Aaron's and it was 
his choice to make," Cummings said Wednesday. "We've followed Dr. Chandra's 
advice. 


"Wisconsin has a pretty strong anti-discrimination law. He clearly has a 
disability. Some people say you must protect some people from themselves. I've 
seen him spar, jump rope and shoot baskets. Our concern was that if he took the 
risk, he'd be aware of the risk. Dr. Chandra talked with him for two hours 
about it." 


But Gordon said Cummings wasn't qualified to determine if Pryor can box. 


"She doesn't know a left hook from a fish hook. And she went out to the gym and 
took a look at him and saw him spar. Is that cause enough to give a man who is 
under medical suspension a license?" 


Pryor said the detached retina and cataracts were in the left eye and that his 
right eye was 20-20. 


"I had my doctor and five other doctors say they are good to fight," Pryor 
said. "I'm fighting this for $4,000 or $5,000 and I could have signed against 
Camacho for half a million dollars. I have been preparing for Camacho for five 
months. 


"I think there are some political things involved." 


Last January, Pryor filed a motion in Hamilton County Municipal Court in 
Cincinnati saying he should receive treatment for drug dependency rather than a 
conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia. 


He was arrested last September in Cincinnati by police who said they found a 
pipe that could be used to smoke crack cocaine in Pryor's car. 


Pryor said Wednesday he is a drug free and completed a month-long 
rehabilitation program in February. 


"I'm in decent shape but my nerves are bad because people are trying to tell me 
what to do," he said. 


Pryor (37-1) won the WBA junior welterweight title in 1980, knocking out 
Antonio Cervantes. He defended his title seven times, twice beating Alexis 
Arguello. 


There is controversy over Jones' record. One boxing service lists it at 13-12, 
while matchmaker Stan Johnson says it is 26-7.

200 PROTESTING INDIAN SPEARFISHING ARRESTED 




From United Press International 




EAGLE RIVER, Wis. 




Police arrested about 200 protesters who gathered at Trout Lake to oppose a 
judge's decision extending the spearfishing season of the Chippewa Indians. 


More than 1,000 people staged a protest at the northern Wisconsin lake, 
objecting to U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb's decision not to halt the 
spearfishing at midnight Friday. The state of Wisconsin had sought an 
injunction to stop the spearfishing season as the general season opened today. 


Provisions of 19th-Century treaties give the Chippewa wide latitude to gather 
food throughout much of Northern Wisconsin. 


For the first time in five years, the spearfishing and non-Indian fishing 
seasons overlapped, largely because the late winter left waters frozen and too 
cold for the spawning of the walleye. 


In Madison, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson appealed for peace between Indian and 
non-Indian fishermen.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY





40 CFR Part 52 






[W12&hyph;2&hyph;5550; FRL&hyph;4821&hyph;2] 





Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; 

Wisconsin 








AGENCY:



 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).




 




ACTION:



 Notice of proposed rule.



 






SUMMARY:



 USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State of Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Rules,
Natural Resources (NR) 405.01 through 405.17, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
State developed the rules as Wisconsin's plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas designated
as unclassifiable or attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to satisfy the requirements
of part C of the Clean Air Act (Act). USEPA proposes to disapprove these rules because they do not meet USEPA's regulation
governing State PSD programs (40 CFR 51.166). Until USEPA approves a SIP submission from Wisconsin satisfying these
requirements, the Federal PSD requirements at 40 CFR 52.21 remain applicable within the State of Wisconsin.




 




DATES:



 Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by March 7, 1994.









ADDRESSES:



 Written comments should be sent to: Carlton Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation
Branch (AT&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois
60604. Please submit an original and five (5) copies, if possible. 





Copies of the SIP revision request and USEPA's analysis are available at the following address for review: U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Region 5, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago,
Illinois 60604. It is recommended that you telephone Constantine Blathras at (312) 886&hyph;0671, before visiting
the Region 5 Office. 









FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



 Constantine Blathras, Grants Management and Program Evaluation Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J),
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;0671. 






SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 

I. Background 





The 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act added part C to title I, which required implementation of a PSD program. On June
19, 1978 USEPA promulgated a PSD program to meet the requirements of part C. It promulgated 40 CFR 51.24 (now 40 CFR 51.166),
which listed the requirements a State must meet in order to have a State PSD program approved as a part of its SIP. It promulgated
40 CFR 52.21, which contains the procedures and requirements which USEPA follows when it carries out the mandates
of part C itself. These &sect;52.21 requirements were then promulgated into those State SIPs where a State did not
have an approvable plan in place. Section 52.21 provides that its requirements and authorities, or parts thereof,
can be delegated to the State and local air programs if USEPA determines they have the ability and authority to carry
out its mandates. 

 On June 19, 1978 (43 FR 26410), USEPA promulgated the Federal PSD program, 40 CFR 52.21(b) through (v), into the Wisconsin
SIP at 40 CFR 52.2581 because Wisconsin had not submitted an approvable PSD program. On August 19, 1980 USEPA gave Wisconsin
partial delegation to run the Federal PSD Program and on November 13, 1987 gave Wisconsin full delegation of the program.


Seeking a SIP approval of the State's PSD Program, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted
its PSD rules, NR 405.01 through NR 405.17, to USEPA as a revision to its SIP on March 16, 1987. A further revision to these
rules, which addresses oxides of nitrogen (NO



x



), was submitted on November 24, 1992. 

Wisconsin NR 405 deals exclusively with PSD permitting requirements.
1
 USEPA evaluated NR 405 by comparing each section of the rule to the appropriate paragraph of 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly
40 CFR 51.24). Although Wisconsin's PSD rules essentially incorporated the Federal PSD provisions in 40 CFR 51.166,
USEPA's evaluation revealed deficiencies relative to references to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), federally issued PSD permits, source-specific allowable
emissions, and modeling guidelines. 











1




Chapter NR 405 applies the PSD regulation within the total area of the State of Wisconsin. Court decisions have determined
that State governments do not have jurisdiction over most Indian lands. This in itself does not affect USEPA's proposal
to disapprove the rule, but would have to be addressed by Wisconsin if it submitted a revised rule.

in Columbia and Dane Counties, Wisconsin, to be known as 

Lake Wisconsin. The petition was submitted by Mr. Charles 

W. Dean, Viticultural Area Consultant, on behalf of 

Wollersheim Winery located near Prairie-du-Sac, Wisconsin. 

The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent 

use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in 

wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better 

identify the wines they may purchase, and will help 

winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in 

other areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 

Background 





On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 

ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 

27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment 

of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations 

also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be 

used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and 

advertising of wine. 



On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 

ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 

providing for the listing of American viticultural areas. 

Section 4.25a(e)(l), title 27, CFR, defines an American 

viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 

distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 

which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 

4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an 

American viticultural area. Any interested person may 

petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a 

viticultural area. The petition should include: 



(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 

area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 

area specified in the petition; 

(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of 

the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 

(c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics 

(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 

distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 

from surrounding areas; 

(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 

viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 

United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the 

largest applicable scale; and 

(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the 

proposed boundaries prominently marked. 





Petition 





ATF received a petition from Mr. Charles W. Dean, 

Viticultural Area Consultant, on behalf of Robert P. 

Wollersheim and JoAnn I. Wollersheim, proprietors and 

landowners of Wollersheim Winery near Prairie-du-Sac, 

Wisconsin, to establish a viticultural area in 

south-central Wisconsin to be known as ``Lake Wisconsin.'' 

The viticultural area is bounded by the shoreline of Lake 

Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. 

Wollersheim Winery is the sole winery located in the 28,000 

acre viticultural area and there are currently twenty-three 

acres planted to wine grapes.
