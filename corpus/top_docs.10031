WORLD LEADERS REJOICE AT MANDELA NEWS 




From Associated Press 




LONDON 




World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R. 
Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to 
build for an event so long awaited by so many. 


Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South 
Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure 
on the white-led government. 


President Bush praised South African President Frederik W. de Klerk for "bold 
and imaginative leadership," and the Canadian government expressed delight at 
the announcement that Mandela would be released today. 


In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge 
for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his 
first reaction was to kneel down and thank God. 


"Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put 
their heads together and build on these developments," Kaunda said. 


Hours after the announcement of Mandela's release date, the ANC's leadership 
announced from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia: "We welcome Nelson Mandela 
back from all those years of imprisonment into our midst with great joy." 


"Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last," said Charles Haughey, 
Irish prime minister and current president of the European Community, which has 
been using economic sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid. 


"By his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human 
spirit can never be vanquished," Haughey said. 


Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the Organization of 
African Unity, sent Mandela a message of congratulation, praising the 
"sacrifices of the great people of South Africa" and assuring him of Egyptian 
solidarity with his cause. 


In the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast news of the announcement, then 
added: "Nelson Mandela has become the world's most famous political prisoner, 
put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa." 


Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square was temporarily rechristened Nelson 
Mandela Square. 


In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures of Mandela, 
celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. 


In a statement released by her 10 Downing St. office, Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher said, "We believe that the steps President de Klerk has taken merit a 
positive, practical response." 


"We believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in South 
Africa -- a restraint which in our case in any event has been voluntary -- and 
we shall be discussing this with our EC partners," she said. 


In 1986, the European Community banned imports of South African iron, steel and 
Kruggerand gold coins, and barred new investment in the country. It had already 
frozen scientific and cultural relations. 


Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory, but not the 
investment ban, and has already announced that it is no longer observing the 
scientific and cultural embargo. 


In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was 
delighted at the news, which he called "a tremendous victory for the people of 
South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign." 


Commonwealth Secretary General Shridath Ramphal said Mandela's safety must be 
guaranteed by the South African government and that until change there becomes 
irreversible, the Commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of 
apartheid. "It is not yet time to demobilize the international support for 
apartheid's victims," he said.

  [Excerpts] Riga, 12 May (LETA) -- "It was the first 
official visit of a representative from independent Latvia both 
to South Africa and the African continent," said the Saeima's 
[parliament] chairman, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, on his arrival in 
Riga from South Africa on Wednesday [11 May]. He participated 
in the inauguration ceremony of the first black president, 
Nelson Mandela. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking of his meeting with the South Africa's new 
president, Nelson Mandela, the Latvian speaker stressed that Mr. 
Mandela is energetic and has a great deal of ideas. However, 
Mr. Gorbunovs, declined to speculate on the development of the 
events in this African country, because relations between the 
black and white remain tense there. Mr. Gorbunovs drew a 
parallel between Mr. Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev, who led 
Russia to democracy and was deprived of his post of the 
president because of the political struggle in the USSR.

  [Text] South African President Nelson Mandela has pledged 
to lend a hand in regional peace-making and development in 
southern Africa. These two areas are expected to be the new 
focus of the group of Frontline States formed to combat 
apartheid. Speaking on the first day of the Frontline States' 
summit in Harare, President Mandela said South Africa will play 
a crucial role in resolving the problems facing southern Africa. 
In the same vein, he said, the Frontline states were still 
necessary to help establish democracy in South Africa. 
  At today's meeting the Frontline states are expected to form 
a new structure which will concentrate on other regional 
problems in conjunction with the Southern African Development 
Community. 
  When asked about the Rwanda situation, Mr. Mandela said 
South 
Africa had already agreed to provide a field hospital and was 
now considering leasing 50 armored personnel carriers to the UN 
for its risky operations. 
  [Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 0500 GMT 
on 4 June 94 adds the following: "President Nelson Mandela has 
returned from his first official visit to a foreign country. 
President Mandela, who attended a meeting of the Frontline 
States in Harare, lauded the Frontline States for their role in 
the dismantling of apartheid."]

  [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- Cuba stated today that Nelson 
Mandela and his people constitute the reality of South Africa's 
dream come true: to have apartheid beheaded. 
  An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the 
electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the 
South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the 
process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in 
Angola. 
  GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by 
the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans 
and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of 
forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the 
South African people. 
  Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson 
Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's 
presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to 
his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering 
principles. 
  It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph 
corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must 
be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened 
at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags 
and have repented for what they once were, it states. 
  The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination 
that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and 
imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the 
notion of superior and inferior races. 
  We are proud to have been and to continue to be close 
companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African 
people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.

  [Excerpt] Joao Lourenco, secretary of the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], has said there was a 
positive development in Lusaka. He was referring to the 
conclusion of discussions on housing. Joao Lourenco said, 
however, that we cannot expect the peace talks to conclude 
anytime soon. Regarding mediators and observers who approached 
South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance, Joao 
Lourenco said all this can be summed in one sentence: Things 
are complicated in Lusaka. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] I interpret the decision to 
approach South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance 
as a sign that things in Lusaka are complicated. Things are 
complicated. Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Angola, feels that talks are 
dragging on. An agreement should have been reached long ago. 
  Before being sworn in as the president of South Africa, Dr. 
Nelson Mandela expressed interest in assisting the Angolan 
people in the best way possible. I believe it was on the basis 
of that interest that Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye approached 
President Mandela in order to help reach a successful conclusion 
of the Angolan peace talks as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  Nelson Mandela is a well-known figure worldwide, and South 
Africa is a regional power. Joao Lourenco said these two 
factors can help to pressure Jonas Savimbi to lay down arms. 
President Nelson Mandela agreed to cooperate. He will not come 
in with new diplomatic initiatives. He will only reinforce the 
ongoing process. The ruling party is happy with Nelson Mandela's 
readiness. His readiness was welcomed by the MPLA. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] We welcomed his readiness to 
assist. We think -- we have always said this -- every form of 
assistance, every step that can truly contribute to the Angolan 
people finding a lasting peace as soon as possible is welcome. 
[end recording] 
  Speaking about the Lusaka peace talks, Joao Lourenco said 
that at present there is a positive sign. He said there is no 
information about the accord at the present, however. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- President Kim Il-song of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on May 10 sent a 
message of greetings to Nelson Mandela upon his election as 
president of the Republic of South Africa. 
  President Kim Il-song said in the message that the first 
multi-racial general elections in South Africa and Nelson 
Mandela's assumption of the heavy duty as its president were an 
expression of the deep trust and expectation of the South 
African people for him and a fine fruition of the protracted 
struggle of its people to abolish apartheid and build a new 
democratic society. 
  He wished the South African president success in his work to 
eliminate all manner of racial discrimination and build a free 
and prosperous new South Africa and expressed the belief that 
the friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples 
would develop in accordance with the idea of independence, peace 
and friendship.

'I FEEL 36,' MANDELA, 72, SAYS 




From Times wire services 




JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 




Nelson Mandela, celebrating his 72nd birthday upon his return home from a 
triumphant international tour, says he feels half his age. 


"I feel like a boy of 36, and the present I would like to have is votes for 
all," said Mandela, who looked tired after his six-week tour of 14 nations, 
including the United States. 


Mandela was greeted by about 200 supporters and relatives on Wednesday, his 
first birthday in freedom after 27 years in a South African prison for fighting 
the country's white-minority government. 


The African National Congress leader says he hopes to see President Frederik W. 
de Klerk in the next few days to set up talks leading to full-scale 
negotiations on ending apartheid. 


"There is no doubt that apartheid is crumbling," he said.

 [By special correspondent Maria Elena Gil] 
  [Text] Accra, 8 May (PL) -- Tonight, Ghanaian President 
Jerry John Rawlings greeted Cuban President Fidel Castro, who 
arrived in this capital at 1030 on a service stopover en route 
to South Africa, where he will attend the inauguration of Nelson 
Mandela. Rawlings expressed his satisfaction at receiving the 
Cuban leader and viewed his visit here as official despite its 
brevity. 
  Castro is accompanied by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government; and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of 
environment, science, and technology. This same delegation 
participated in the First World Conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May in 
Bridgetown, Barbados. 
  Speaking to reporters before leaving for Barbados, the Cuban 
leader considered it a political miracle that Mandela managed to 
conciliate the different ethnic forces in his country in such a 
way that the first interracial elections were successfully held 
with the triumph of Mandela's party, the African National 
Congress (ANC). 
  "Mandela is the perfect man, the only who with the talent, 
necessary wisdom [word indistinct] current political moment in 
South Africa," the Caribbean statesman stated. 
  "Cuba's commitment to Africa is a historic one." We do not 
want to speak of our contribution to the South African people's 
cause, because they -- the ANC and Mandela -- have made the most 
important contribution. 
  Nelson Mandela will be inaugurated this coming Tuesday, 10 
May, during a ceremony in Capetown, which will be attended by 
many heads of state and government from all parts of the world.

  [Text] Pretoria, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
arrived today in this beautiful capital, in which Afrikaners 
have kept themselves segregated for decades from natives, to 
attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first black 
president of South Africa. 
  The Cuban delegation, headed by Castro, was one of the most 
eagerly awaited here. The African people believe that Cuba, 
particularly Fidel, had to participate in the celebration of 
Mandela's victory, according to opinions expressed yesterday 
during Castro's brief stopover in Accra, the capital of Ghana. 
  During his brief visit, Castro had a friendly meeting that 
lasted until the late hours with President Jerry John Rawlings, 
who welcomed Castro at the international airport in this capital 
and invited him to the presidential residence, where they 
discussed matters of common interest, particularly within the 
African context. 
  Tomorrow both Rawlings and Castro will participate in the 
ceremony during which outgoing South African President Frederik 
de Klerk will transfer the government to President-elect Nelson 
Mandela. It will be a momentous ceremony not only in the 
history of this country but for the entire black continent as it 
marks the end of apartheid. 
  "We have a moral and historical commitment to South Africa," 
Fidel Castro said before traveling to Pretoria accompanied by a 
high-level delegation that includes Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina; National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; and Rosa 
Elena Simeon, minister of environment, science, and technology. 
  "Fidel Castro's presence at Mandela's inauguration is not 
merely a matter of protocol," Foreign Minister Robaina told 
PRENSA LATINA today. "We want to show that Cuba's ties with the 
people of South Africa and of this continent were forged in the 
struggle for independence and strengthened by the blood shed by 
hundreds of Cubans who fell fighting against the same forces 
that the ANC now defeated at the polls," he added. 
  Mandela's ANC won the 27 April elections and will create a 
government of national unity in which de Klerk will be the 
second vice president. 
  In Fidel Castro's opinion, "the most difficult task for 
South 
Africa begins now, but Mandela is the perfect man for the job 
because he has the wisdom and talent that the political climate 
demands."

  [Excerpts] Nelson Mandela's electoral victory has been 
welcomed in Angola. Acting President of the Republic Franca van 
Dunem says the victory of Mandela and the ANC is also a victory 
for the Angolan people. 
  [Begin Van Dunem recording] I am pleased that the ANC 
struggle has culminated with its victory at the polls. I am 
convinced that my sentiment is shared by the majority of 
Angolans, who, for many years now, have rubbed shoulders with 
South African nationalists, and have given their best to make 
today's celebrations a reality throughout Africa. Likewise, the 
efforts of Angolans over the past years, which culminated in the 
ANC victory....[changes thought] I am convinced that the victory 
of the ANC and the South African people in general will be 
beneficial to developments throughout Africa. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco is pleased with the outcome of 
the South African elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Moco] It is not an issue that only 
affects 
Angola. Obviously, Angola will benefit from the new situation 
that has been created in southern Africa. I would like to 
stress, however, that over the past years this process has 
attracted the attention of the whole world, and Africa in 
particular. It is not only a question of an ANC electoral 
victory, but fundamentally a process of liberation and struggle 
against racial segregation and of oppression of men by men. So, 
I think the ANC victory is very good for us because the ANC 
consists of our friends, who have fought by our side. I would 
like to stress the major change that is taking place in the 
world right now with the acknowledgment of all the victories the 
South African people have scored in the past few years. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] As South African president, 
will 
Nelson Mandela ask to play a more important role in the Angolan 
peace process? 
  [Moco] Any country involved in a process like this depends 
fundamentally on its own people and on the capacity of its 
politicians. That has been proven in South Africa. Like I said 
earlier, with the completion of the liberation process and of 
elections in South Africa, Nelson Mandela and his country will 
know how to make a major contribution to Angola's progress, 
including the peace process and development, because we are 
aware that South Africa is a major economic power. 
  [Correspondent] But what about the ongoing Lusaka talks? 
  [Moco] Well, I think the Lusaka talks have made a great deal 
of progress, despite a number of difficulties. What matters 
with the South African experience is to specifically consolidate 
the peace process in Angola and in southern Africa in general. 
I think this will be a very useful experience. The fact that 
Nelson Mandela and other South African politicians now have more 
time to take part in African meetings, particularly in southern 
Africa, will be very useful to us in general. [end recording]

  [Text] It has been officially announced in Pretoria that 
South African President Nelson Mandela made one of his first 
foreign policy decisions today, establishing diplomatic 
relations with Cuba. 
  Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina 
and 
Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in 
relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments 
had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government 
and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of 
apartheid. 
  Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela, 
leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the 
relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for 
years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the 
government level. 
  During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been 
moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations 
between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's 
internationalist position against the policy of apartheid 
against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia, 
and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now 
a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection 
toward Cuba. 
  Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will 
conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa, 
a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson 
Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left 
behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now. 
  At the signing of the new document regarding diplomatic 
relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was accompanied by 
Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador to Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, 
minister of Science, Technology, and Environment; and (Marcos 
Rodriguez), who will represent our country in Pretoria 
temporarily.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 May (EFE) -- Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco today praised his future South African counterpart, 
Nelson Mandela, for his victory in the recent elections and for 
his epic fight in favor of democracy and against racial 
discrimination. 
  Franco, who is 62, sent Mandela a 62-line message stating 
that his victory revitalizes freedom, and represents a sign of 
hope for humankind and a historic deed for South Africa that 
will have repercussions over the entire African continent. 
  Franco told Mandela: "The long epic battle Your Excellency 
and the African National Congress have fought against racial 
discrimination has been closely followed from this side of the 
Atlantic Ocean, with a profound spirit of solidarity." 
  Franco pointed out that the new political panorama will make 
it possible to promote bilateral relations and cooperation, the 
potential of which he considers to be unexplored. 
  In a note sent to current South African President Frederick 
de Klerk, Franco praised his stature as a statesman, which made 
possible the transition process culminating in the installation 
in South Africa of a multiracial democracy. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will represent the Brazilian 
president at Mandela's installation ceremony, which will be held 
in the South African capital on 10 May.

Harare this afternoon. The organization has appealed to all 
involved to stop the killings and said it was prepared to offer 
military or other assistance to help stabilize the situation. 
Estelle Pienaar reports that South African President Nelson 
Mandela received a hero's welcome on his arrival in Harare to 
attend the meeting: 
  There was a tumultuous welcome for South Africa's President 
Nelson Mandela today as he arrived in Harare for his first 
official foreign visit as head of state. Zimbabwean vice 
president and one of the founder members of the Frontline States 
back in 1974, Mr. Joshua Nkomo, was there to meet him, but at 
the conference center in the city delegates of the Global 
Coalition for Africa who have been meeting in the Zimbabwean 
capital since yesterday, together with the Frontline States, had 
depressing matters to address. 
  The ravaging Rwanda civil war was addressed during a brief 
informal discussion of the seven Frontline States' presidents 
and South Africa's head of state, President Nelson Mandela. All 
were very concerned about the current situation in Rwanda. 
Afterwards the Frontline States met for the first time 
embracing South Africa into the brotherhood of the subcontinent.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, met with South African President 
Nelson Mandela in Cape Town today. Present at the meeting were 
six observers in the Angolan peace process, including the U.S. 
ambassador in South Africa. Alioune Blondin Beye briefed Nelson 
Mandela on the development of the peace talks in Lusaka. Manuel 
Augusto, Angolan charge d'affaires in South Africa, told Luanda 
Radio Nacional today that the meeting was positive. 
  [Begin recording] [Augusto] As far as we know, President 
Mandela expressed gratitude for the briefing. He also expressed 
his readiness, at the request of the relevant parties, to render 
his contribution within the framework of the Lusaka talks. In 
other words, President Mandela made it clear that he will not 
take initiatives which are outside the Lusaka spirit or which 
could collide with the Lusaka spirit. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] We have learned here in Luanda 
that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to join the group of 
mediators in the Angolan conflict, that he even expressed a 
readiness to meet very soon with President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. When do you think these 
meetings will take place, particularly with the president of the 
Republic? 
  [Augusto] In my understanding, I think it is not very 
correct 
to say that he agreed to join the group of mediators. In his 
capacity as the head of state at the present, President Mandela 
would not join anyone, because we have no mediators at the level 
of heads of state. It is correct to say, however, that 
President Mandela expressed a readiness to join efforts aimed at 
bringing peace to Angola. 
  President Mandela also said at the end of the meeting this 
afternoon that, at the request of the UN mediators, he is ready 
to meet with all the parties involved in the process. It is 
important to clarify, however, that at no time was it said that 
there would be a summit meeting. As long as he is requested, 
President Mandela is ready to take part in or promote meetings 
with the Angolan Government and UNITA. 
  Regarding the meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, 
President Mandela has just expressed his readiness to meet him. 
So, some contacts will be made through the appropriate levels 
and channels between the South African Government and the 
Angolan Government so that the Angolan Government can tell the 
South African Government in which areas it expects it to render 
its contribution. [end recording]

  [Text] Today, Cuban President Fidel Castro met privately 
with his South African counterpart, Nelson Mandela. Castro 
attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony in Pretoria yesterday. 
  Early this morning, Castro visited Mandela at Mandela's 
official residence, where they talked behind closed doors. In 
remarks to the press yesterday, Castro said new possibilities 
for cooperation between the two countries are opening up, as the 
African National Congress assumes power. He added that because 
of the ties of friendship and affection that exist between the 
two countries, with no other country in the world are there such 
broad possibilities for cooperation as there are between South 
Africa and Cuba. 
  After meeting with Mandela, Castro granted the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation, the local television network, an 
exclusive interview at the Arcadia Hotel, where he and all the 
members of his top-level delegation are staying. 
  Regarding his first visit to South Africa, whose army fought 
Cuban troops in the struggle for the independence of Angola and 
Namibia, Castro said there are two South Africas and two moments 
in the history of South Africa. He said there was a moment of 
strong confrontations but that now there is a new South Africa, 
where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.

 [Quotation marks as received] 
  [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa [May] 21, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY -- 
The leader of the revolution sent the following letter to the 
African militant Nelson Mandela, the laureat of al-Qadhdhafi 
international prize for human rights, on the occasion of the 
victory of the people of South Africa: 
  "To His Excellency Nelson Mandela, the president of the 
Republic of South Africa, greetings, words are unable to express 
this historic victory of a people who fought injustice, 
falsification, tyranny, murder, torture, humiliation and disdain 
for 300 years. But this people did not capitulate or recognize 
under torture that the land of blacks belonged to whites paying 
for that with blood and tears which resulted at the end in the 
declaration of freedom and independence of the people of South 
Africa. On this historic occasion, we must stand solemnly in 
tribute and respect for the martyrs of Soweto, martyr Steve Biko 
and Mahatma Ghandi whose name was linked to the cause of the 
South African people. Also revolutionaries everywhere and all 
peoples confronting [word indistinct] colonialism respectfully 
salute hero Nelson Mandela, the [words indistinct] immensely 
patient man. The struggle and victory of our people in south of 
black Africa draws the historic way for the struggle and 
expected victory for our people in usurped Palestine. Nothing 
muddled the clear skies of South Africa lit with candles of the 
bodies of the victims of racism and lamps run with the blood 
spilled for freedom and cleaned with the tears of millions who 
were tortured for the sake of their right to live in their 
homeland except the presence of the racist terrorist Zionist 
delegation which befouled purified South Africa. It seems that 
the Zionists were so guilt ridden that they allowed themselves 
to attend the delight of people during their celebration of 
victory over international racism. Did the Zionist forget their 
unholy alliance with the Pretoria regime and their support for 
it against you "and the exchange of expertise in torture and 
racism?". Weren't the Israelis the natural ally of the racist 
regime of South Africa. Didn't the Israelis take part with 
whites in tens of years of genocide and torture against blacks. 
Glory for you personally and your great people and martyrs 
[word indistinct] on the collapsing Zionist racism and white 
racism. Yours brotherly, Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi [no closing 
quotation mark as received].
