   If James Naismith had a better sense of history, he would
have invented basketball a few weeks after he did, sometime
in late December of 1891. That would have given his sport's
centennial a Columbian parallel, and also would have made it
coincide with an Olympiad in which basketball is expected to
be a, and maybe the, featured attraction, thanks to the
recently named "dream team" of U.S. professional stars.
   Naismith, however, fashioned the game in response to a
more immediate imperative. In his 1941 book, "Basketball: Its
Origin and Development," he recounts how, as a new,
30-year-old gym instructor at the YMCA International Training
School in Springfield, Mass., now Springfield College, he was
put in charge of a class of administrators-in-training that
was bored to the point of mutiny with its daily winter
regimen of calisthenics. He'd badgered superiors with his
belief that if exercise could be made to seem like play
instead of work, the most re-calcitrant pupils would
participate willingly. One responded by giving him the
troublesome class, saying, in effect, "Put up or shut up."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I went to work with this class," Naismith wrote. "I tried
{having the men play} soccer and we smashed all the windows.
I tried lacrosse and smashed most of the fellows' arms. Rugby
football finished the students up, until they were ready to
quit on recreative games."
   He went on: "In a day or two I would have to report to the
faculty the success or failure of my attempts. So far they
had been all failures. How I hated the thought of admitting
that, after all my theories, I, too, had failed to hold the
interest of the class."
   So he repaired to his office to meditate on the sort of
game that might be played indoors and be challenging but not
rough. It must, of course, involve a ball -- didn't they all?
-- and be easy to learn. But what of the fun element?
   The most interesting game at that time was American rugby
(football), he mused, but it was inappropriate for indoors
because it involved tackling. Why? Because players were
allowed to run with the ball and it was necessary to stop
them. But . . . if they couldn't run with the ball, tackling
could be eliminated]
   "I can still recall how I snapped my fingers and shouted,
`I've got it]'" he wrote.
   The rest -- the elevated, horizontal goal and general
rules -- fell into place, and within days Naismith's Y
charges were happily playing the game that would be the
U.S.'s most important gift to sports. Baseball may be our
poets' choice, and football may be No. 1 on the domestic
tube, but basketball, with its free-flowing form and abundant
opportunities for individual virtuosity, is the American game
the world has chosen. FIBA, the Olympic regulator of the
sport, recognizes national governing bodies in 176 countries,
10 more than belong to the United Nations. Surveys I've seen
identify basketball as the world's foremost spectator sport.
   It is, furthermore, the game that is most purely "ours,"
baseball and football having direct British antecedents. My
encyclopedia mentions a 16th-century Aztec game called
"ollamalitzli," in which players tried to throw a ball
through an elevated stone ring. But it notes that any player
who succeeded was entitled to the clothes of all the
spectators, so it couldn't have been very high scoring.
   Several things about basketball's beginnings seem worth
mentioning in this centennial year. One is the biography of
Naismith. This was a man of parts. Born and raised in the
northern Ontario hamlet of Bennie's Corners, he was orphaned
at eight and at times had to drop out of public school to
support himself as a logger or farmhand. Nonetheless, he
would receive a degree in theology from McGill University and
an M.D. from Gross Medical School in Denver.
   He never held a pastorate, though, nor did he practice
medicine. He wrote that his aim in life was to "do good," and
he concluded that encouraging wholesome leisure pursuits
among the young would accomplish this best. A naturalized
U.S. citizen, he spent most of his working life at the
University of Kansas, where he became chairman of the
physical education department. He died in 1939 at age 78.
   Secondly, we are reminded of the role of chance in
invention; many of basketball's most salient features just
kind of happened. For instance, Naismith wanted boxes to
serve as goals, but the janitor he asked had only peach
baskets handy. They were placed 10 feet off the ground
because that was where the balcony of the Springfield gym, on
which they were nailed, began. And backboards were
introduced, in 1893, to keep spectators from helping their
favorite teams by swatting away opponents' shots.
   Lastly, once basketball's foundations were laid, it was
remarkable how quickly it approached its present form. Free
throws after fouls were introduced in 1894, the point system
of two points for field goals and one for free throws came in
1896, five-player teams were accepted in 1897 and the dribble
-- the most important change in Naismith's original plan --
was made legal in 1898. In later life, he liked to remark
that the biggest difference between the game he devised and
the one that evolved was in the skill of the players.
   Over the next few months, the centennial will be marked in
a number of ways. The YMCA, which also spread the game
abroad, has various celebrations planned, and the game's Hall
of Fame in Springfield will host a series of events
culminating in a black-tie gala on Dec. 21. That's the day
set as the game's birthday, although nobody knows for sure.
   The National Basketball Association, whose teams begin
practice this week, says its players will wear centennial
patches on their warmup suits in the coming season, and other
commemorations will be staged. But it's questionable how
Naismith would regard the league. He wrote that basketball
would be basketball as long as four things didn't change: The
large, light ball; the elevated, horizontal goal; and no
personal contact or running with the ball. Seems that NBAball
qualifies on only two of those counts.

<LEADPARA>  SATURDAY was the 100th anniversary of basketball's creation. On the afternoon
of Dec. 21, 1891, a physical education professor in Massachusetts named James
Naismith nailed a peach basket to a wall and bounced a soccer ball onto the
floor.;   And on the afternoon of Dec. 21, 1991, at Toso Pavilion, the
basketball teams of San Jose State and Santa Clara commemorated the event by
nailing each other with elbows -- and bouncing their torsos off the floor, the
basket supports, the bleachers and anything else that was handy.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STILL A PEACH OF A GAME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And San Jose State came from behind to score a ragged and rugged 61-60
victory.;   "The game is 100 years old today?" asked Spartans Coach Stan
Morrison afterward. "Well, we set it back 50 years.";   Not entirely true.
Saturday's game hardly was an outright dog. The drama was thick. Santa Clara
and San Jose State were two struggling teams, trying to find their stride
early in the season. The Broncos are still searching. At the final buzzer,
Santa Clara forward Rhea Taylor was lying flat on his back in agony, pounding
his fists on the hardwood after he missed the final shot. Meanwhile, San Jose
State's players hugged and yelped at center court.;   In short, it was like
the finish of thousands -- millions? -- of basketball games played over the
last century. It was why the game has lasted so long and become so much a part
of our sports landscape. Saturday was an occasion to toast all of that,
although Santa Clara was not in the mood. The Broncos, with all five starters
back from last season, are 2-6.;   "The 100th anniversary, huh?" said Carroll
Williams, Santa Clara's head coach, then added in sarcastic frustration: "It's
a great game, isn't it? A great game.";   The sport's centennial has not drawn
the attention here that it has in other places, because the Bay Area is
nowhere close to being a hoops hotbed, the Warriors' current exalted state
aside. Of the 25 largest college basketball arenas, none is located in
California. And only 1,425 spectators showed up for Saturday's game.;   But
that doesn't mean Saturday's historical moment should pass without mention.
Today, worldwide, basketball is more omnipresent than ever. And the recent
success of the women's teams at Stanford and Santa Clara indicates the sport
may be entering a whole new level of popularity.;   Yet it gives one pause.
What if Naismith hadn't been able to find a peach basket that fateful day in
1891? Or what if he'd slipped on the ice, broken his hip, and had never made
it to the gym? Would we now be spending the winter watching ESPN telecasts of
Big East croquet? Or curling?;    "I CAN'T imagine what the world would be
like without basketball," Morrison said. "In my view, it's right up there with
the invention of the wheel. Without basketball, I don't know what I would be
doing right now. I would probably be a teacher, I guess. Or an architect.";  
At least one of Saturday's players was pondering the same thoughts. As he
packed his duffel bag after the game, the Spartans' Terry Cannon proudly
pulled out a certificate that the American Basketball Congress has sent to
every college player this year, commemorating their appearance in the
centennial.;   "Basketball isn't just a sport for some people, it's a
lifestyle, a livelihood," said Cannon. "It's allowed me to receive an
education and allowed others to earn a living by teaching it.";   A major
cultural force, in other words. From small-town driveways, to big-city
playgrounds, to Toso Pavilion on a Saturday afternoon. Happy birthday, hoops.
You've earned the right to party.  </TEXT>

On Sports: 'All-Short' Basketball

<TEXT>
   The National Basketball Association playoffs are in full swing, a fact that delights some but produces ennui in others. 
The yawners say it's a waste to tune in an NBA game until the last two minutes, or that even tuning in before June is a waste. 

   Still others believe that it isn't just the NBA's brand of hoops that's lacking, but modern basketball in general. 
Members of this faction hold that the players have outgrown the facilities and turned Dr. Naismith's noble invention into a track meet for giraffes. 
They would like to raise the baskets, enlarge the court and trim the number of contestants to four from five. 

   I must say that I do not count myself among basketball's critics. 
Knocking the players for being too tall, too swift and too agile reminds me of the character in the movie "Amadeus" who faulted a Mozart tune for having too many notes. 
Nevertheless, I feel obliged to pass along the news that a new professional basketball league is being planned that will answer at least one of the malcontents' beefs. 
No player loftier than 6-foot-4-inches tall will be allowed to perform. 

   The league has been dubbed the International Basketball Association. 
At the moment, it is mainly a gleam in the eyes of a handful of individuals who have yet to purchase a basketball. 
The backgrounds of some of them, however, indicate that they may own several one day soon. 

   The league's chairman is Ben Hatskin, a resident of Winnipeg, Manitoba, who owned the Winnipeg Jets in the old World Hockey Association. 
His signing of Bobby Hull away from the Chicago Blackhawks gave that loop the shot it needed to rival and, later, merge into the National Hockey League. 

   The guy who'll run the league is Dennis Murphy, who helped start the WHA, American Basketball Association and Team Tennis. 
In charge of basketball operations when there are some, and public relations in the meantime, is Bob Cousy, the old Boston Celtics' flash. 
Some say basketball hasn't been the same since the 6-foot-1-inch Cooz hung it up back in '63. 

   Cousy now broadcasts Celtics games, and says he has no enmity for the established circuit. 
"Basketball's a great sport and the NBA's a great league," says he. 
"We see ourselves existing alongside the NBA, not competing with it. 
Kind of like a little brother, if you know what I mean." 

   The IBA's founders say that the size of the players won't be the only novelty of their enterprise. 
They are aiming for a summer schedule of 50 to 60 games beginning in 1988, there will be a salary cap of $600,000 on each team's roster of 10 or 11 players, and the "International" in their name will be no mere curtsy to our immediate neighbor to the north. 

   According to Murphy, the IBA plans to promote international competition on two fronts. 
He says the league will petition the International Olympic Committee to begin staging competitions in a 6-foot-4-and-under division in addition to the open-to-all one it now maintains. 
He points out, with justice, that boxing and wrestling are conducted by weight class. 

   The IBA has moved on its own to internationalize the sport by agreeing to meet a team from the Philippines in a series in Manila next September. 
It will hold tryout camps in Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and New York this summer to pick a 10-man All-Short team to make that trip. 
Murphy hopes this will be the first of a broader series of contests matching teams from various countries in what eventually would become a sort of World Cup of Short Basketball, in which his league would represent the U.S. 

   "Basketball is the No. 2 sport in popularity -- behind soccer -- in Europe, Latin America and Asia, and the game in those places is quickly reaching U.S. standards," he says. 
"If you equalize for height, you'd have good competition right off the bat." 

   The nearer-term prospects for the IBA will depend on getting a domestic league off the ground (but not too far), and Murphy says that strides have been made in that direction. 
He says that groups from seven localities -- New York, Chicago, Boston, Winnipeg, Los Angeles, Orange County, Calif., and Fresno, Calif. -- have ponied up $25,000 each for the right to form IBA teams. 
The plan is to sell five more franchises at $100,000 each for an inaugural-season circuit of 12 squads. 
By contrast, the 23-team NBA just peddled four new franchises for $32.5 million apiece. 

   Getting players will be no problem, the league's founders believe. 
They point out that our nation's colleges excel in producing highly qualified basketballers, many in the 6-4-or-under class, and that the existing domestic professional loops -- the NBA and minor-league Continental Basketball Association -- employ just a fraction of the available talent. 

   "The best of the shorter players, like {6-foot-2-inch} Steve Alford of Indiana, will still sign with the NBA, but that'll leave plenty for us," says Cousy. 
"Guys like {5-foot-11-inch} Billy Donovan of Providence or {5-foot-3-inch} Muggsy Bogues of Wake Forest would be perfect for our league, and we'd showcase them best because they wouldn't be playing against giants." 

   The IBA would further distinguish itself from the NBA by using a 30-second shot clock to the NBA's 24 seconds, allowing five timeouts a game to the NBA's nine (hurrah!) and letting players whip the ball into play themselves after back-court violations instead of waiting for a referee to bless the sphere (double hurrah!). 

   Mostly, though, the IBA is banking on the box-office appeal of normal-size players. 
"Who does the average-sized person identify with? 
Another average-sized person, of course," avers founder Murphy.

MIKAN WAS THE GIANT OF HIS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
George Mikan likes to tell about being the good-natured giant of his day, of 
the time he made the mistake of bringing an offensive rebound low enough for 
Red Holzman to tie him up. So they had a jump ball at Mikan's free-throw line 
-- little Red against big George. "The referee tossed the ball up and I tipped 
it into the basket; two points," Mikan said. Ha, ha. Holzman called him a big 
(unprintable). Ha, ha again. In the enormous boom of basketball, the game never 
has properly honored its roots. At the recent "Night of 100 Stars," Mikan was 
introduced, limped across the stage and waved to a crowd of mostly unknowing 
stares. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's he?" 
</P>
<P>
He's the Babe Ruth of basketball, that's all. Except that they didn't move the 
fences back and make them tall for Ruth the way they did for Mikan. He changed 
the course of basketball as a player. He wore No. 99. It was only 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Association was called the Basketball Association of 
America for two years before the merger. Mikan played in the National 
Basketball League, which was poo-pooed because it had teams in Sheboygan, Wis., 
and Anderson, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
It had Mikan, who invented the big man. He was 6-foot-10 and as broad at a time 
when hardly anybody else was. "He could move down the court," Bob Cousy 
recalls. "He'd get down and wipe you out at his end." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers won the NBL championship and then earned five titles 
in their first six seasons in the merged NBA. It was like the Cleveland Browns 
joining the haughty National Football League and doing the same thing they did 
to the All-America Conference. The one year the Lakers lost, in 1951, was when 
Mikan had a broken leg and Rochester with Holzman beat them. "The doctors taped 
a plate on it for the playoffs," Mikan said. "I played all right, scored in the 
20s. I couldn't run, sort of hopped down the court." 
</P>
<P>
He says if you watch the old black-and-white films you'll see that the game 
hasn't changed all that much -- except they used the two-hand set shot and the 
jump shot was still being invented and all the black players were still with 
the Harlem Globetrotters. That's all. 
</P>
<P>
And you won't see a dunk. It was illegal because of him, he says. In college, 
at DePaul, he would bat the ball out of the basket, so they instituted rules 
against goaltending, and included offensive goaltending. "We used to dunk in 
pregame practice, not in the game," Mikan said. "If they didn't get rid of that 
rule, there'd be no Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Mikan the three-second lane was widened from 6 feet to 12 feet, and 
to the present 16 feet. And the shot clock was created. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball against the Lakers, beating them 
19-18 in the lowest-scoring game in NBA history. "They wouldn't play," Mikan 
said. The 24-second rule came in three seasons later. "That game was the 
biggest cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also was the first commissioner of the red-white-and-blue ABA. The 
three-colored ball came and went with his league, but the three-point shot 
stayed. Mikan might have changed the history of the game again if he'd been 
more effective. Uniondale might have been the capital of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was graduating from UCLA as Lew Alcindor and Mikan's owners 
got together to draft Alcindor and share the cost for the New York franchise, 
which was the Nets en route from Commack to the Nassau Coliseum. "We felt if we 
could get accepted in New York, we'd be accepted anywhere," Mikan said. "The 
secondary plan was to have each team sign one top player from the other league. 
They wouldn't follow my direction." 
</P>
<P>
They did steal Rick Barry and prepared a check for $1 million for Alcindor, who 
said he wanted to play in New York or California. He said that he'd take just 
one offer from each league. "One million was beyond anybody's imagination," 
Mikan said. "It was a shock when he turned us down and went to Milwaukee. We 
thought a million was a pretty good deal in 1968." We can only guess what would 
have evolved if Abdul-Jabbar had played his 19 seasons with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Mikan left his mark as a player. "We were playing Rochester and when I got a 
defensive rebound, Les Harrison wanted Holzman to stand right in front of me so 
I couldn't get upcourt. The first time, I knocked Red 15 feet. He yelled to 
Harrison, 'If you want it done, do it yourself."' 
</P>
<P>
I'd take my chances with this team against anybody: Jerry West, Oscar Robertson 
and Bob Cousy at guard; Elgin Baylor, Bob Pettit and Bill Russell at forward 
and Wilt Chamberlain at center. 
</P>
<P>
Today Cousy would be John Stockton. An assist was an assist then; none of these 
assists for passing out for a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
"No question they'd do fine," Knicks assistant Paul Silas said. "Those guys 
were a lot more fundamentally sound than players of today. Today there's a lot 
of flash. These guys throw passes behind their backs; what a pass is supposed 
to do is get the ball from one point to the other. The two-hand chest pass is 
still the best pass." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan said that he loves the present game; he buys the excesses as so much show 
business. Silas and Cousy are not quite so permissive. 
</P>
<P>
"The game hasn't changed, the athlete has changed," Cousy said not too long 
ago, citing the 6-7, 280-pound football player who runs 40 yards in four 
seconds. "In basketball you see 7-foot guys doing things of a 6-footer. We shot 
40 percent; that wouldn't get you by in Division III." 
</P>
<P>
Cousy popularized the flash that consumes so much of today's game, except that 
he used the flash when the orthodox wouldn't do. He dribbled behind his back 
the first time in a game because he was being overplayed. "Today every 
12-year-old in the schoolyard is doing it, probably better," he said. "But they 
do it bringing it upcourt to no advantage."

<LEADPARA>  There simply are not enough superlatives to describe the wonderful, fantastic,
incredibly awesome basketball launcher invented by 9-year-old Taylor Holmes.; 
  With 10 springs and a little thread, Taylor turned an ordinary pair of
gloves into a launcher extraordinaire. The third-grader swears he gets an
extra six inches or a foot on every throw.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I have a friend who was kind of getting mad at himself because he couldn't
get the ball to go through the hoop with a regular basketball, so I thought
maybe the gloves would help," said Taylor.;    "And it works.";    Taylor, a
student at Camino Pablo Elementary School, unveiled his top-secret invention
Thursday during his class's annual Invention Convention.;    For the third
consecutive year, students in Marlene Thier's class have come up with a
dazzling array of new devices.;    There's the automatic pet scratcher, the
automatic room picker-upper, the automatic trash taker-outer and the PetAway
security system that comes complete with motion sensors and timers that
trigger sprinklers to soak trespassing pets.;    Thier's 25 students are part
of a group of 10,000 students nationwide competing in the Invent America
Program sponsored by the U.S. Patent Model Foundation. After a team of
Lawrence Hall of Science judges selects the best of the lot, Thier hopes her
winning student will get to compete with national winners in Washington.;   
There were also many water-saving devices in this fifth year of drought. The
Shower Timer measures water as it's used to let a bather know when 20 gallons
have gone down the drain. The Rain Keeper is a giant plastic canopy that
catches rain water. Wash and Flush sends drain water from the sink into the
toilet, where it's used for flushing.;    But pets were a strong theme.;   
Amanda Malmquist created the pet scratcher, mounting a pasta fork on a box
over a little battery-run motor. The flick of a switch starts the motor
whirring and the fork moving back and forth.;    "My grandma has a dog, and my
hand gets so tired scratching its back," said Amanda as she demonstrated her
device on a stuffed rabbit.;    Jason Chiu had a mission when he set out to
create PetAway: no more strays wandering through the yard.;    His elaborate
security device uses motion sensors and timers that trigger sprinklers. Best
of all, wayward dogs set off a taped recording of a roaring lion.;    There's
only one hitch.;    The device can't tell the difference between a letter
carrier and a poodle.  </TEXT>

neighbors notice if you run out to get the paper that you're
shorter?'' said Bob Martin, who operates the company with his
sister and three brothers.
   Ninety styles, priced $40 to $120, are displayed in 100,000
square feet of warehouse space just south of Frederick. It sells
direct and through mail order.
   ``We don't feel we've even scratched the surface'' of the number
of men who want to appear taller, said Martin. ``Depending on the
style, our shoes can make a man two inches taller. I've had people
call me up ... they say `the difference in my height has made a
difference in my social life.'''
   Elevator shoes have come a long way from the days when the
company's celebrity spokesman, Mickey Rooney, sported oxfords with
chunky heels that didn't hide their purpose. Today's elevator shoes
look like normal shoes but have a built-up insole.
   Martin said he even has one regular customer who stands 6-foot-5.
   ``I asked him why,'' he said. ``He said he was a basketball
player in college and all his friends were 6-feet-7 or 8.''

   A self-cleaning bathtub and salt dyed red
so that people can know how much they use. Sunglasses with pockets
and a life-preserver for horses.
   Those are inventions by kids involved in a program called Invent
America, which seeks to boost the level of creativity and
innovation in this country.
   At Dommerich Elementary School in this Orlando suburb,
fifth-graders are brainstorming their way to new ideas to resolve
problems, such as locating a dog at night or taking out the garbage.
   The Invent America class is taught by Gil Rowe one day a week to
each of five classes of gifted students in different grades. He
came from Ocoee Elementary School, which won four of Invent
America's nine state awards, the most of any school in the country.
   ``We've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old
American ingenuity,'' says Rowe, 44. The program was started by the
privately funded U.S. Patent Model Foundation in Washington.
   Besides opening up the innovative process, Rowe says, the
program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented
a device that earned him his classmates' admiration.
   ``Suddenly he became a famous inventor. He just became a totally
different individual,'' Rowe said.
   The problem of finding a dog at night was addressed by
11-year-old Seth Swanson, who plans to develop a dog collar with a
light attached before the class ends with a school fair in April.
   Ten-year-old Robbie Cadle hates carrying the garbage cans out so
much that he concentrated all his efforts on that one issue.
   His solution? Motorized garbage cans that can be driven from the
house to the street, and back.

<MEMO>  Dave Anderson is a columnist for the New York Times.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But as basketball awaits this weekend's celebration in Springfield, Mass.,
of its 100th birthday, its creator, Dr. James Naismith, is still alive in the
mind of one of his grandsons.;   "I remember Papa Jimmy taking me to the old
Madison Square Garden in 1936 on his way to Berlin for the Olympics," Jim
Naismith, 68, said the other day. "I think we were in the Garden for the
Olympic Trials and after he tossed up the first ball, I sat with him in the
press row. But that day he was angry about something.";   Now stocky and
white-haired, the grandson was 12 then, and his grandfather was 74. For the
first time, the Olympics would include basketball.;   But the man who in 1891
had peach baskets hung in the Young Men's Christian Association Training
School gym in Springfield was annoyed at the selection process of the U.S.
team.;   "He was happy basketball was going to be played in the Olympics that
August," his grandson recalled, "but he was disappointed that it wasn't
serving the purpose it was meant to: a game you played for sportsmanship and
to use the winter months.";   In that case, what would Naismith think of
today's basketball with its multimillion-dollar pros about to soar into midair
in the Olympics next summer, its multimillion-dollar college tournament, its
multimillion-dollar television contracts, its multimillion-dollar sneaker
contracts for coaches?;   "I think he would consider the game itself to be a
natural evolution," his grandson said, "but the salaries might bother him. He
never thought of making money out of basketball. . . . He wasn't interested in
money. He turned down a considerable amount of money to endorse cigarettes."; 
 Naismith was a doctor of medicine and a doctor of divinity who also held a
master's degree in physical education.;   "He was a very firm Presbyterian
minister," his grandson remembered. "To him, it was important for the
spiritual, mental and physical aspects of life to work in harmony. But he was
a very kind, genial man. When he was at the University of Kansas, he would
drive out in his Model T Ford to visit us in Fort Collins, Colo. I would go
fishing and camping with this man I liked very much.";   He remembered
basketball's founder as a stocky 5-foot-8, with sturdy forearms from growing
up as a Canadian lumberjack.;   "He had a cauliflower ear, and he always had
that mustache you see in all those younger pictures of him wearing a suit and
a starched collar," he said with a smile. "That mustache was a prickly one. I
know that from all the times he kissed me.";   As it turned out, their day at
the 1936 Olympic Trials was the last time Jim Naismith would see his
grandfather, who died in 1939.;   "I follow the Knicks; I'm glad when they
win," said this now-retired chairman of the performing arts program at
Rockland County Community College. "But as a youngster, I was a terrible
basketball player. I couldn't dribble, I couldn't pass and I certainly
couldn't hit the basket. Not that my grandfather would have cared. To him,
other things in life were always more important."  </TEXT>

THERE'S EVEN ROOM FOR ROMAR IN THE BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN HUNT, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the world's most extensive Romar collection hangs in a back room at the 
Basketball Hall of Fame, away from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lorenzo Romar, a 6-foot-1 guard, began when he averaged 9.3 
points as a University of Washington senior. Or was it when the Golden State 
Warriors selected him in the seventh round of the 1980 draft, or when he 
averaged 7.6 points in his best National Basketball Assn. season, was waived 
three times in little more than a year, played for the Continental Basketball 
Assn.'s Evansville Thunder and Tampa Bay Thrillers in 1984-85, or . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before the 24-second clock runs out, let's toss this one up: What in the name 
of Topsy Del Gobbo is a Lorenzo Romar uniform doing here anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It's time Romar thanked the Detroit Pistons for waiving him Nov. 8, 1984. He 
went to Milwaukee, a free agent. His Detroit uniform went to the Hall of Fame, 
a goodwill contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes basketball fame is nothing more than convenience. The Pistons didn't 
need Lorenzo Romar, or his uniform. The Hall of Fame needed a Piston uniform 
for an exhibit of representative NBA uniforms. The rest, as they say at 1150 
West Columbus Ave., is basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"Me? In the Hall of Fame?" said Romar, 30, who became a Christian six years ago 
and joined Athletes in Action in San Diego. "I wasn't even aware of it. It's a 
complete shock. And I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
Well, history at the Hall of Fame can mean many things. It can mean George 
Mikan, Bob Pettit, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Pete Maravich and 
Julius Erving. And it can mean Lorenzo Romar, John Paxson, Mark McNamara, 
Clemon Johnson, Moore's All-American Redheads, the South Philadelphia Hebrew 
Assn. and the menu from Larry Bird's Boston Connection restaurant in French 
Lick, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Romar said, "they're trying to draw some sort of contrast." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the contrast -- and a surprising number of genuine basketball artifacts 
-- is tucked away beyond the "Spalding Shoot Out," past the Bob Coyne cartoons, 
the Sports Illustrated covers and the NBA locker-stall exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In an isolated storage area not much bigger than the Boston Celtics' locker 
room, a Romar uniform shares rack space with those of Earl Jones of Springarn 
High School in Washington, D.C., Neal Walk of Florida (the difference between 
him and UCLA's Lew Alcindor was a coin flip in the 1969 draft), LaRue Martin of 
Loyola, John Paxson of the San Antonio Spurs and Clemon Johnson of the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the generic: jerseys from the University of Connecticut 
(women's), Slippery Rock College and Punxsatawney High School. Detroit Piston 
fans should note that the latter was acquired for a Groundhog Day display, not 
for a tribute to Coach Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
Here one can find trophies, stained green by time, saluting national industrial 
league champions from 30 years past, Civilian Conservation Corps and 
Caterpillar (as in tractor) AAU jerseys, a watch by Elgin commemorating the 
1944 NBL champion Zollner Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, those basketballs. A red, white and blue ABA edition ("Dave 
DeBusschere, Commissioner") signed by Julius Erving or immortalizing a 92-foot 
field goal by the Pacers' Jerry Harkness that beat the Dallas Chaparrals Nov. 
19, 1967. Even a ball from the 1924 National Interscholastic championship game 
-- Windsor (Colo.) 25, Yankton (S.D.) 6. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the bouncing balls and you'll find one dribbled 451.8 miles from 
Hodgdon, Maine, June 14-21, 1984 for the opening of the new Hall. Do not, under 
any circumstances, overlook the nonstop dribbling record of 347.2 miles at 
Covenant Children's Hospital in Decatur, Ill., Aug. 8-11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity? Be serious. There's more tread left on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Could those be Bob Lanier's size-22 sneakers? And, there, below a tabletop with 
Michael Jordan's NBA All-Star jersey and Elgin Baylor's Seattle University 
jersey, Spud Webb's garment bag. Hold on . . . sorry, it's another Lanier 
colossus, a white canvas Converse, in a king-size sneaker bag. The other 
sneaker was part of the U.S. exhibit at last summer's World Expo in Brisbane, 
Australia. The Hall's prized Lanier pieces are a bronzed pair on display. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Lee and Michael Jordan weren't even Air-born when Lanier first laced up 
what may be the most famous artifacts in basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking industrial-strength odor-eaters," says Michael Brooslin, the 
Hall's curator. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Hall's storage walls are 150-200 basketballs, 300 uniforms, a table 
of trophies, trinkets and watches, six shelves of sneakers, pennants, plaques, 
cartoons and life-size cutouts of Parade All-Americans. Boxes are stacked on 
top of boxes. And still more boxes: The Hall's inventory grows by 300-400 items 
yearly. Only a small percentage makes it to the big show, the Hall of Fame 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Some trophies are broken. You'll have to excuse the shooter's shattered left 
leg on the 1980 Pepsi-Cola NBA Old-Timers game trophy. But the gold touchtone 
phone presented to Ed Gottlieb at the 1969 NBA All-Star game probably could get 
through to the Miami Heat hotline. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like the 1986 Hall of Fame game trophy, are unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was supposed to be given to the Celtics," Brooslin said. "They 
never took it." 
</P>
<P>
Politics (President Calvin Coolidge), royalty (Spain's Prince Felipe de 
Borbon), Hollywood (Cary Grant), fantasy (Linus, Snoopy, Charlie Brown), Lana 
Turner and Andre Turner converge here as unlikely memories of a game invented 
in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Springfield College professor. 
</P>
<P>
How to organize such a mess? Andy Warhol's estate recruited Sotheby's. The Hall 
of Fame has only Brooslin to sort, document and organize an intriguing 
collection from the 1890s to the 1980s. Brooslin, 33, became the Hall's first 
curator almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything was in boxes before I came here," Brooslin said. "Now we 
pretty much know what we have. But it's a five-year type of deal. It looks like 
we'll go to a computer next year. That will help.' 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Brooslin sits before stacks of index cards, tagging and 
cataloguing. Although Brooslin admits to visiting the old Hall of Fame at 
Springfield College only once while a student at nearby American International, 
he says he's having the time of his life. Beats his last job by a longshot -- 
curator of the National Rollerskating Museum in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Some items Brooslin will never ID, such as the faded orange tanktops with 
stenciled numbers, no player or team names. The tag reads, "Orange tank, 
unidentified." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like, 'Why the heck do I even have these?' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon Brooslin returned from the basketball shelves, his eyes 
as big as the Walter Brown Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a complete inventory," he says. "I didn't even know I had this 
Hollywood stars basketball until two days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Tony Curtis. Lana Turner, Barbara Stanwyck, Hayley 
Mills. Gene Kelly, Doris Day, Gina Lollabrigida. Tony Randall, Sandra Dee, Rock 
Hudson. It's a bouncing Hollywood autograph book, auctioned by Dorothy Lamour 
to raise funds for the 1968 Olympic team. The Beta Shoe Company bought it for 
$285. 
</P>
<P>
If only the names were so clear on the lace-up ball signed by Calvin Coolidge. 
His signature and the year, 1924, are clearly visible. So is John C. Jeets, 
tournament director. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through it and through it," Brooslin said. "I can't even figure out 
what tournament it is." 
</P>
<P>
A classic ball -- so, it looks like a football exposed to a mutant air pump -- 
with a president's signature doesn't make the cut. It sits next to a ball 
dribbled 185 miles by Boxboro High School on Dec. 23, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to use it not so much for the signature," Brooslin said, "but it's one 
of the better lace-up balls we have. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors pay up to $5,000 for a uniform. The Coolidge ball? 
</P>
<P>
"For that particular basketball," says Carol Sherman of Profiles in History, an 
autograph broker in Beverly Hills, Calif., "we'd probably price it at 
$500-$1,000. If we knew who else signed it, it might be worth much more." 
</P>
<P>
Profiles prices the "Hollywood" ball at $750-$1,000. Of course, once in the 
Hall, always in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors," Brooslin said, his faced curled in a sour look. "I don't even 
want to talk about it. With old stuff, it can be difficult for us. But anything 
new, you know who's going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Remember the NBC peacock, brought to you in living color? Presenting Ira 
Harge's contribution to basketball history, a 1971-72 ABA Miami Floridians 
uniform: black, orange with a magenta stripe and stirrups. Let's be kind and 
say the design lies somewhere between Bo Ellis and Alexander Julian. 
</P>
<P>
And no ABA collection is complete without a Marvin Barnes (never inducted, 
never indicted) original, "Spirits of St. Louis" printed in orange over the 
Lindbergh plane with "Marvin" on the back. 
</P>
<P>
For pure, glow-in-the-dark slickness, we suggest a red satin jacket with an 
Indian emblem worn by Clarence (Bevo) Francis. An appropriately flashy outfit 
for someone who scored 113 points for Rio Grande College against Hillsdale Feb. 
2, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' jacket was displayed in the old Hall, more a shrine for New England 
basketball. Now the uniforms of Walter Luckett (Kolbe-Bridgeport), Tom Roy 
(South Windsor) and Ron Perry (Catholic Memorial) and a ball commemorating 
Danny Moore's 71-point night for South Catholic Feb. 13, 1970 are here, in the 
Hall of Fame but not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Well, take heart. Fillipe de Borbon's Celtic jersey, a replica of that given 
Spain's prince at the McDonald's Open last year, didn't make it. Even though, 
Brooslin says, "It's our first piece of royalty." 
</P>
<P>
You'll also find Rick Barry's No. 24 (Golden State Warriors), Oscar Robertson's 
No. 4 from the Cincinnati Royals, Earl Monroe's No. 10 from Winston-Salem, 
ceramic ashtrays made by Maurice Stokes, the uniform top of Dick Van Arsdale 
(Phoenix Suns) and the shorts of twin brother Tom, a crumbling banner from the 
1904 Universal Expo in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
And Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to give some reasons why I'm there," Romar said, "but I can't think 
of any statistic that would qualify me for the Hall of Fame. I had a career 
high of 22 points, twice. I had eight steals once. I had 14 assists a couple of 
times -- guys are almost averaging that now." 
</P>
<P>
But he was waived at the right time. Twice. Don't bother looking for Romar's 
Warrior uniform. You'll never see it. The other half of the Hall's Romar 
collection is open year-round to the public, part of the NBA uniform exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Lorenzo Romar, Detroit Pistons, has made it to the floor of the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give up hope, Mike Smrek.

SEPARATING THE FACTS FROM OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fact: Until the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl victory, never before had teams 
from one state simultaneously held the pro football, baseball and basketball 
championships. (You can look it up.) 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Had cornerback Lewis Billups not dropped an easy interception in the 
end zone in the third quarter, the Cincinnati Bengals would have won the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Eight of the top 12 scorers in this week's National Basketball Assn. 
rankings left college before their senior years. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: I'm so happy George Steinbrenner was pardoned. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Larry Brown already is quietly complaining that he is miserable coaching 
the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Pistons and Lakers in the finals. Pistons in six. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: About 79% of the Proposition 48 cases are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: You can have my seat to Leonard-Hearns. A couple of has-beens. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: One year ago, college basketball's ultimate national champions were in 
the middle of a four-game losing streak, their record dropping to 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Charles Oakley for Bill Cartwright is the most lopsided trade of the 
year in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Carl Yastrzemski's father, Carl Sr., still works a daily shift at the 
port in Boston Harbor. He is 72 and works inside maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Making Dave Schmidt a permanent starter is a good move. The Orioles 
should have done it 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: There was a standing ovation the other night at Halsey Field House when 
poor Derric Turner, the Navy basketball player who is 6 for 44 shooting free 
throws this season, made one against UNC Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: With freshman Alonzo Mourning and sophomores Dikembe Motumbo and John 
Turner, Georgetown has truly frightening potential. I can see the Hoyas winning 
2 national championships in the next 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Seventeen of pro basketball's 25 head coaches are in their first or 
second seasons with their current teams. (On the other hand, head coaches in 
the Big East, Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Conference have been in their current 
positions an average of 9 years.) 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: It says much about the state of American soccer when, in the year the 
national team finally should qualify for the World Cup, the coach of the team, 
Luthar Osiander, quits because he would rather be a maitre d' at a restaurant 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Oregon State basketball Coach Ralph Miller, retiring this year after 38 
years in the business, knew James Naismith, who invented the game. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: It's popular to say Mario Lemieux is hockey's best player now because 
he is far ahead of Wayne Gretzky in the scoring race. Before this becomes law, 
however, it might be nice for Lemieux to lead a team to the playoffs once. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Maryland basketball team has not won a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Back from the Supe in Miami, I must admit I like stone crabs more than 
Maryland crabs. (Nah, did I say that?) 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Reggie Lewis is averaging 19 points as Larry Bird's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: I bet Dan Quayle has a lot to say about Proposal 42. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Blast of the Major Indoor Soccer League had 10 days off, then played 
back-to-back games this week. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Pete Rozelle, the old pitchman, is losing his public relations touch. 
Before the Super Bowl, he said the Overtown riots had "ruined part of his 
week," and that the leftovers from his mega-party would be given to the 
homeless. Such compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: After only 4 months at No. 2, Ivan Lendl again is the world's No. 1 
tennis player after winning the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: There is no better show in college basketball this year than Louisiana 
State freshman Chris Jackson. Yow.

<LEADPARA>  IN THE official NBA Register, in the section titled "All-Time Greats," on
Pages 292 and 293, compressed into 67 lines of type is the basketball career
of one Nathaniel Archibald, more familiarly known as Nate or Tiny, a
cherubic-faced child of the Bronx who fought his way out and, much more
significantly, fought his way back in.;    Monday night, in Springfield,
Mass., Tiny Archibald was one of seven men enshrined in the Basketball Hall of
Fame.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'TINY' ARCHIBALD: A BIG MAN JOINS HALL OF
FAME  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Bill Lyon is a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His likeness, cast in bronze, will appear in the building named for James
Naismith, who invented the game that Tiny Archibald elevated to another level.
You like to think that Naismith would have a special fondness for Archibald,
who was a comparative runt at 6-foot-1, 160 pounds, but who befuddled the
bigger people with his fearless, slashing sorties down the lane and his
clever, creative passing. Left-handed, he would nail the pull-up jumper or
ride on invisible currents of air to the hoop, a sprite whose eyes shone with
excitement and the simple joy of playing. Peter Pan in sneaks.;    Tiny
Archibald is in the Hall of Fame on extravagant statistical merit, having
amassed more than 16,000 points, more than 6,400 assists, more than 2,000
rebounds in 13 professional seasons. That is a most impressive career
triple-double.;    But there is another, rarer, more admirable triple that
Tiny Archibald is soon to complete. It is an educational triple. He has
acquired his bachelor's degree and his master's, and now he is closing in on
his doctorate, in education. Tiny, the Ph.D. Dr. Archibald. It has a certain
ring.;    Now 42, he resides in the Bronx, father of five. He has, indeed,
gone home again. But more, he is one of the special ones who make a
difference. In the mornings, he serves as a recreation director for homeless
men, talking to them, not down to them: "I grew up with a lot of these guys;
they know I'm just trying to help them realize they can make it, too.";    In
the afternoons, he makes the rounds of elementary and junior high schools,
counseling, encouraging, just as he remembers being inspired when he was
younger: "Just trying to pass it on.";    In the evenings, he attends classes
at Fordham University, closing in on that educational triple. It is an object
lesson in persistence and perseverance.;    Tiny Archibald learned the city
game on the asphalt proving grounds of the Bronx, went to Arizona Western,
then to Texas-El Paso, then to the NBA. In the 1970 draft, he was taken in the
second round by Cincinnati. He would be traded three times, waived once,
signed as a free agent once. He would be on the roster of five different teams
between 1970 and 1984. He would miss one entire season with a torn Achilles'
tendon. He would be an all-NBA first-teamer three times, second team twice. He
would be an All-Star Game MVP. He would be a member of a championship team.;  
 In short, there was nothing in the mad, nomadic, intoxicating, chaotic,
potentially destructive life of a professional athlete that Tiny Archibald
would miss, from the champagne-spray giddiness of the championship ring to the
bleak despair of the surgeon's scalpel.;    If the sport ever gets around to
compiling an official register that lists what a man did with his life after
he stopped bouncing the ball, then top billing belongs to Tiny Archibald, who
scours the shelters and the schools, nurtures the abandoned and the confused,
a Pied Piper of the sidewalks, the steam vents and the playgrounds.;    The
only thing about him that doesn't fit is his nickname. In all that truly
matters, Tiny is a giant.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Baseball Lockout Forces Media Companies to Make Alternate Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the baseball lockout never ends, what will
the sports media write and talk about this summer?
   Some media companies already are juggling their plans even as
they hope they will never have to answer that question.
   The lockout has blocked the opening of spring training camps for
nearly a month, and it already has cost the ESPN cable network five
of the 10 spring training games it planned to televise this year.
   Potential problems loom for CBS, which is to begin broadcasting
baseball in April; The National, the new daily sports newspaper,
and The Sporting News, the sports weekly.
   ``It hasn't affected us yet, but baseball is the only game in
town in the summertime,'' said Tom Osenton, president and chief
executive of The Sporting News Publishing Co. in St. Louis. ``If
you take the game away, you have nothing to write about.''
   ESPN is in the first season of its $400 million contract to
carry up to 175 games in each of the next four years.
   ``Getting that contract was such an exciting moment for us,''
said Mike Soltys, manager of programming information for ESPN. ``To
start out in this manner is certainly discouraging.''
   The network filled the gaps created by the lost games with live
tennis, auto racing and other programming it had originally planned
to tape for later replay, he said.
   Plans are to substitute a college basketball playoff game, a
college baseball game and college wrestling, among other events if
the remaining spring training games are canceled, Soltys said.
   He said the network is sticking with its plans to run a baseball
show, Baseball Tonight, seven nights a week starting as scheduled
next Monday.
   If the lockout continues, the show will deal with developments
in negotiations between the players and owners and may feature
coverage of minor league baseball, he said.
   But ESPN faces a more serious problem in April, when it planned
to begin carrying six games a week. The network has hired 19
commentators to handle the nightly baseball show and the games,
Soltys said, and has sold more than 60 percent of its season's
advertising inventory in the games.
   Soltys said the advertisers are being given the options of
appearing on the replacement programs, holding off until the games
start or getting refunds.
   But he said the lockout has hurt the climate for selling
advertising. ``There is no way of knowing where we would be without
this,'' he said.
   Soltys said ``there are provisions for lost games'' under the
network contract with baseball, but he refused to describe them. A
source familiar with the contract said ESPN and CBS will be given
additional games in the next three years for games lost this year.
   The lockout has posed a less serious problem so far for CBS,
which agreed to pay $1.06 billion for the right to broadcast 16
regular season games, the All-Star game, the playoffs and World
Series every year for four years.
   CBS' first baseball broadcasts are scheduled for April 14 and
April 21, but its third broadcast is not scheduled until June 16.
   CBS Sports spokesman Tony Fox said the network has not decided
what sports programs will replace the April game broadcasts.
   Fox said more than half of CBS' advertising inventory for
baseball had been sold, but he declined to discuss what plans were
being made for advertisers if games are canceled.
   The network plans to run its baseball season preview show on
March 31 as scheduled no matter what happens with the lockout, Fox
said.
   As at The Sporting News, the lockout has had little impact so
far on The National, according to editor-in-chief Frank Deford. The
newspaper debuted Jan. 31 in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Deford said readers of The National usually are interested in
several sports, and there has been plenty of activity recently in
college and professional basketball, boxing and hockey to interest
them.
   But if the baseball lockout continues into mid-summer, ``that
would be a real blow to us, there is no question.''
   At The Sporting News, Osenton said plans are being made to beef
up basketball and hockey coverage over the next few weeks and said
if the lockout persists, the tabloid may increase coverage of minor
league baseball.
   Deford said it was unlikely The National would start covering
minor league or Japanese baseball because he doen't think readers
want it. ``You can't give people something they don't want,'' he
said.
   He said if the lockout continued into June, there probably would
be more coverage of major tennis, soccer, golf and swimming events.
He said the paper also could be trimmed to 32 pages from the 40-48
pages it has been running.
   Deford professes to be unconcerned and has made no contingency
plans. ``My best judgment is I cannot conceive of a situation where
they will not be back by June,'' he said.

POINT GUARDS: VIPS OF BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON KROICHICK, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rewind the basketball VCR, back to a time when a kid named Earvin -- not yet 
Magic -- wore out the sidewalks of Lansing, Mich., with his incessant 
dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
The game revolved around centers. Wilt posted up, Wilt got the ball, Wilt 
dunked. Russell swatted away shot after shot. "Sky hook" entered the 
vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
Now fast-forward to 1990. Earvin has long since become Magic, joined by friends 
known as Isiah, K.J. and Stockton. They do not play center, but now the game 
revolves around them. 
</P>
<P>
With all necessary apologies to Patrick Ewing, Akeem Olajuwon and David 
Robinson, centers just aren't enough anymore. Basketball has grown, stretched, 
quickened. Point guards are hip. 
</P>
<P>
Got a great point guard? You're in the hunt. Got an ordinary one? Forget it. 
Just ask Akeem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to find a great point guard than a player at any other position," 
Utah Jazz president Frank Layden says. "It requires more skills, and the 
biggest is to be a decision-maker." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of great point men intensifies the search. The Jazz dipped into 
Spokane, Wash., in 1984, plucking unheralded John Stockton from unheralded 
Gonzaga University. Projected as Rickey Green's backup, Stockton instead became 
a star. 
</P>
<P>
As Utah knows, that does not automatically mean a championship ring; it's 
simply a key piece to the puzzle. Each of the last two NBA Finals have matched 
Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas, good buddies and top-flight point guards. Glen 
Rice may have scored bushels of points, but Rumeal Robinson was equally 
important to Michigan's NCAA title team last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Newell, who coached Cal to the national championship in 1959 and now 
scouts for the Cleveland Cavaliers, sees this as no coincidence. "You'll have a 
hard time winning a championship without a great point guard," Newell says. 
</P>
<P>
And today, "great point guard" has wider meaning than in the past. Point guards 
once did not worry about scoring. Dribble, organize, pass. Keep teammates 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cheeks, now with San Antonio, epitomizes that kind of point guard. As 
he climbed the basketball ladder, his job description seemed clear. Be a 
playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," Cheeks says. "Just pass. Nothing else. It was never in my makeup 
to score 20-25 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Now these guys are more able to score. It's a time for younger guys who can 
score and penetrate. They're more versatile." 
</P>
<P>
They score, they penetrate, they pass, they lead. Stockton and Kevin Johnson, 
widely considered the leading point guards for the '90s, have firmly put an end 
to the old style. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson last season became only the fifth player in NBA history to average at 
least 20 points and 10 assists (joining Magic, Thomas, Nate Archibald and Oscar 
Robertson). Stockton averaged 17.1 points and a league-high 13.6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
They are the wave of the future for several reasons. As defenses expand -- more 
double-teaming, more traps and thinly veiled zones -- coaches want swift point 
guards who can rush the ball upcourt, create fast breaks or at least start the 
offense quickly. 
</P>
<P>
And since the point guard most often has the ball, he must be a threat to shoot 
the jump shot or drive to the basket. Forget about poor-shooting, 
10-points-per-game stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's out," Magic says, grimacing and shaking his head. "All these guys can 
score. You've got to be a 17-12 man, or 17-11. That (10 points) just doesn't 
get it. The defense will let you have the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Since this is a story about point guards, we'll let Johnson have the first 
shot. He has earned it. 
</P>
<P>
THE MAGIC MAN 
</P>
<P>
Most conventional concepts of the point guard took a beating in the late 1970s. 
A tall guy with a wide smile emerged from Everett High School in Lansing, then 
moved on to nearby Michigan State. They called him Magic. They said he played 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, the Kings' director of player personnel, remembers his 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard about him in college as a 6-9 point guard, I said, 'Oh, 
B.S. You're saying he's a point guard, but he really isn't,' " Reynolds 
recalls. "Then I saw him, and he really was a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like seeing the pyramids for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Earvin Johnson handled the basketball as if he were 5-foot-9. He loved to push 
the ball upcourt, where he could creatively pass off to teammates. He had a 
funky, ugly set shot -- which he made just 46 percent of the time in college -- 
but then, point guards did not need a great shot. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did most 6-9 players. Johnson just never fit the traditional role of a 
big man, comfortable only within an arm's reach of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tall, but I could always dribble," he says. "Everywhere I went as a kid 
-- to the store, wherever -- I dribbled. I became a point guard because I 
dribbled so much. 
</P>
<P>
"And passing always gave me just as much satisfaction (as shooting). To make a 
good pass was like a rush, a high, and it still is." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson grew up admiring Nate Archibald, taking ideas for passes from Kevin 
Porter and Pete Maravich. Porter played for Johnson's home state Detroit 
Pistons, and he still holds the NBA single-game record of 29 assists. 
</P>
<P>
That mark -- and not much else -- has eluded Johnson. His magical act, which 
took Michigan State to the '79 NCAA title, became an instant NBA hit. In 
Johnson's very first season, 1979-80, he and skyhook inventor Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar led the Los Angeles Lakers to the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
In Kareem's first four seasons in Los Angeles, the Lakers never won a title. 
When a great point guard arrived, they immediately did. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has since added four more rings to his collection. In becoming the 
player most synonymous with winning since Bill Russell, he sparked a 
fashionable trend in high schools and on playgrounds across America. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, tall kids wanted to handle the ball. Their coaches may not have 
trashed the idea as quickly as they once did -- "Well, if Magic can do it ..." 
-- but no replica showed up in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"We get carried away with Magics," says Lee Rose, formerly a successful college 
coach and now the Milwaukee Bucks' director of player personnel. "We think 
everybody's going to be a Magic. Hell, there's only one Magic. 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to find those open men isn't necessarily because he's 6-9. A lot 
of people that height cannot do what he does." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, point guards have shrunk since Johnson's entrance. His chief 
rivals in the league today -- Thomas, Stockton, Kevin Johnson -- all must 
stretch to exceed six feet. 
</P>
<P>
Many respected basketball people hesitate to drop Magic Johnson into this 
group. Jerry West, a decent player in his day, harkens back to earlier times 
when speaking of Johnson -- when guards were guards. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic's a guard, because he can do everything," says West, now the Lakers' 
general manager. "If you watch him, Magic is a pretty simple player. He just 
has charisma. 
</P>
<P>
"When Magic was born, they sprinkled a little extra gold dust on him." 
</P>
<P>
So how exactly do we measure Johnson's impact on the position? He clearly 
brought focus and attention to point men. He helped accelerate the game into 
the open court, where guards have more impact than centers. 
</P>
<P>
And passing became a bit more chic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say I've made people aware of being a passer," Magic says. "Players now 
are conscious of doing that. Since that's happened, I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
THE EVOLUTION 
</P>
<P>
For all his wondrous achievements, Johnson did not hang around the peach basket 
with James Naismith. It only seems as if Magic were there, offering suggestions 
about how to position players in this new game. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the key moments in the evolution of the point guard are easily 
distinguishable. The first sign of life occurred when big men stopped jumping 
so often. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the war, guards were great big plodding guys, because there was a 
center-jump after every basket," Newell says. "The fast break started back 
then, with the elimination of the center jump." 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1954, a major rule change forever changed the role of point guards. 
Dismayed by slowdown strategy and low-scoring games, Syracuse Nationals owner 
Danny Biasone introduced the 24-second clock. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, point guards such as Bob Cousy, Slater Martin and Dick McGuire spent 
less time dribbling around, protecting leads and shooting free throws. The 
clock made teams PLAY and made point guards do more than handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, another new rule completed the shape of today's game. 
When the league adopted the three-point shot in 1979, defenses had even more to 
worry about.

MIKE DOWNEY: A BASKETBALL HISTORIAN MAKES USC HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Miner watches the little guy in the black-and-white movie, weaving in 
and out, in and out, dribbling and driving, dribbling and driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Cousy always kept his teammates happy. That was his specialty. And he was 
never satisfied. Cousy always tried to elevate his game to another level. I try 
to incorporate that into my own style of play." 
</P>
<P>
And now Miner watches a taller guy in another old movie, working over a 
defender, making his move, making his shot, making his man look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Oscar Robertson, now he was a consummate basketball player. Watch him back the 
guy guarding him toward the basket, use his body and his strength to his 
complete advantage. I'm built more like Oscar. I'd like to be more like him." 
</P>
<P>
Miner pops still another cassette into his VCR. He watches poetry in motion. He 
watches an artist at work. He watches Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
"Now with Doctor J, it was more like ballet. It was grace and style. He turned 
basketball into an art form. Everything Julius Erving did on that court was a 
thing of beauty." 
</P>
<P>
And finally the films are in living color and current and hi-fi'd and Dolby'd. 
And the star of the show is a guy from Chicago, a guy with his tongue hanging 
out, a guy who makes other guys' jaws drop. And this guy looks amazingly like 
Harold Miner, only older. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jordan? Well, the only word that I can think of to describe Michael is 
greatness. You know, people try to compare me to Michael, and I just laugh and 
laugh at that. I'm no Michael, no way, no how. God, well, He doesn't make too 
many Michaels." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner, 19, already has become something of a basketball historian. He is 
a student of the game, this USC sophomore who has developed into one of the 
nation's top scorers. He raids the video stores and book shops, checking out 
every videotape or volume that has anything to do with basketball, past or 
present, from Naismith to Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Miner is much like Mike Tyson, who even in his teens had 
committed to memory details and facts from the fights of Jack Dempsey, Gene 
Tunney, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali and others before and after. 
Miner studies basketball players like homework, oldies and newies. He's 
different from other guys his age who wouldn't know Bob Cousy from Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Has it paid off? Well, it hasn't hurt. Miner almost certainly will break John 
Block's quarter-century old USC record for points in a season. Already this 
season, the 6-foot-5 guard has lit up Notre Dame for 35 points and nine 
rebounds, made Digger Phelps regret not landing him as a recruit and moved Dick 
Vitale to refer to Miner as "the best thing to happen to USC since football." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps playing the way he's playing, some day they'll make movies about him. 
</P>
<P>
With George Raveling's Trojans only now venturing into the taller weeds of 
their schedule, beginning Wednesday night at UCLA, Miner has become the 
Pac-10's player to watch, the conference's leading returning scorer from last 
season. He is building a Miner cult following. A fan club. Harold examiners? 
</P>
<P>
His nickname is Baby Jordan. Like Michael, he shaves his head, rubs his fingers 
together like a dice shooter, floats to the hoop with his tongue in a droop. He 
says he sometimes has dreams at night in which he leaps for a dunk from the 
free-throw line and jams the ball through the basket backward. 
</P>
<P>
Miner is so infatuated with Michael that he thought about enrolling at North 
Carolina, just for a shared experience. Even his number is 23. Harold 
identifies with him so, he probably pours Diet Coke over his Wheaties. 
</P>
<P>
Also like Jordan, however, Miner would sacrifice some of his personal success 
if only USC could establish itself as more of a force in college basketball, 
after having losing records over five consecutive seasons. The Trojans were 
49-95 during that span. 
</P>
<P>
He could lead them out of the hoop wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Miner is one of the best players in the country," Phelps said after 
Notre Dame's 105-95 loss to USC at South Bend, Ind. "We really wanted him here, 
and you can see why. He's going to be one of the greatest scorers the game has 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing about Miner picking USC: One of the main reasons he did so was to 
play closer to his family in Inglewood. Then his father, Melvin Miner, a 
computer programmer for IBM, was transferred to Colorado. So, when Harold 
scored 24 points in USC's 74-67 victory on Dec. 8 at Colorado State, it was the 
first chance his father had to see him play in a collegiate game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attendance is growing at USC home games, as both Miner and the team 
get better and better. 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is out there watching him, Miner is a performer suitable for 
children or adults. He is a sensation with the critics, even if he is not yet 
big box office, and we definitely give him thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it doesn't matter if it's a hundred people," Miner said. "When Doctor J 
was playing at Massachusetts, he was always playing in front of empty crowds."

HOOSIER HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CASTLE, IND., WILL BE HOME OF $2.5-MILLION PREP BASKETBALL SHRINE

NEW CASTLE, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Newlin stood on a rise in this rolling hill country, 35 miles east of 
Indianapolis, gazing in wonder at the nearly completed building, then shot a 
roll of film, getting progress photos of the construction project. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be finished (soon)," he said. "It will take seven or eight months 
after that to set all the exhibits in place. We hope to be open in time for the 
state tournament next March." 
</P>
<P>
Newlin, 30, is executive director of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, soon 
to be located here in New Castle in its first permanent home, a $2.5-million 
shrine to the favorite game of Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., dedicated to the 
game played all over the United States, but no other state has anything like 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame represents the spirit, the values, the 
tradition of being a Hoosier. This museum will salute the schools, the players, 
the coaches, the communities that have made Indiana the nation's basketball 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Mass., in 1891 and 
was first played in Indiana in 1894 at the Crawfordsville YMCA. Since then, 
more than 250,000 Hoosiers, boys and girls, have played the game on the high 
school varsity level and worn the colors of 1,200 different schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana has been absolutely nuts about basketball since the first state 
championship tournament in 1911," Newlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is by far the most important sport in the state, outdistancing football and 
baseball in popularity. Hoosier hysteria over basketball is part of our 
culture, part of what Indiana is all about. On a per-capita basis, Indiana has 
produced more professional basketball players than any other state." 
</P>
<P>
He rattled off the names of such Hoosier hoop luminaries as John Wooden, Oscar 
Robertson and Larry Bird. He told how the state tournament each year draws more 
than a million fans. He mentioned that Indiana has eight high school basketball 
gyms that seat more than 7,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"No other state can say that," he boasted. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame crowns a hill next to New Castle's Chrysler High School, which 
has the biggest prep basketball gym in the world, seating 9,350. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame has captured the imagination and pride of 
people all over the state, from Aberdeen to Zipp and Zulu, in Indianapolis, 
Evansville, Terre Haute, Lafayette, Gary, Elkhart, South Bend, Anderson, 
Muncie, Marion and Bloomington, in Young America, Windfall, Wawpecong, Mongo 
and Old Tip Town. 
</P>
<P>
Henry County, in which New Castle is located, passed a 1% restaurant and 
beverage tax to raise $1 million toward the Hall of Fame's cost, and last 
month, donations from individuals and groups had exceeded $1 million. Marsh, an 
Indiana supermarket chain, gave $200,000. Two well-heeled Hoosiers each kicked 
in $25,000. There are Hall of Fame committees in every one of the state's 92 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
A half-million dollars has been raised in the "sale" of bricks -- 2,500 that 
went for $100 each and 500 more that sold for $500 each. In the center of the 
Hall of Fame's courtyard, a 70 x 36-foot map of Indiana will be made up of the 
$100 bricks, containing donors' names, and the $500 bricks will be inscribed 
with names of teams and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Botany Prof. Robert Hoshaw, 67, teaching at the University of Arizona in Tucson 
for the last 39 years, is typical of how many former Hoosiers have reacted to 
the hall.He said that he and the five other surviving members of the 1939 
seven-man Monticello High School basketball team each purchased a $100 brick. 
</P>
<P>
"Our school had less than 200 students," he said. "We had a great team 50 years 
ago. We wound up in the regional final, one of the top 32 schools in the state. 
Four of us went into teaching, one into insurance, one became a judge in the 
Chicago area, and one of the fellows died. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of Hoosier Hysteria, we figured it was only right we do our part in 
contributing to the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. Twenty of us from 
Monticello High each also chipped in $25 to buy a brick in memory of our 
outstanding basketball coach, the late Alva Staggs." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Alford, 46, basketball coach at Chrysler High the last 14 years, is the 
father of Steve Alford, 24, former All-American at Indiana University, now with 
the Golden State Warriors. The Alford family bought a brick, since five Alfords 
played basketball in Indiana -- Sam's father, Sam and his brother, and Sam's 
two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The five of us scored 8,000 points playing basketball in Indiana in high 
school and college," Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
Megaphones, trophies, uniforms, letter jackets, game balls, cheerleader 
sweaters, yearbooks, scrapbooks, class rings, mascots and other basketball 
memorabilia is pouring into the hall's temporary office in what was an old 
school building in downtown Indianapolis, at 520 Virginia Ave. 
</P>
<P>
"Team nicknames are something else," Newlin said, laughing. "Epson Salts for 
Epson High School. I thought the Monroe City Blue Jeans came by their name 
because there was a denim factory in town. I was wrong. It came from an 
early-day governor, who lived in Monroe City, James (Blue Jeans) Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, there have been 1,200 high schools in the state that put 
basketball teams on the floor. Today, because of consolidations, Indiana has 
400 high school teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have something from every high school that ever had a team," Newlin 
said. "Alumni are tickled pink to have a chance to do something for the old 
alma mater." 
</P>
<P>
Every day's mail brings something new. James Griffin sent in scores he compiled 
of every state tournament played in the last 78 years from the sectional level 
through the state final. 
</P>
<P>
The letter jacket of Larry Hobson, holder of a single-season scoring record at 
Pekin High, where he averaged 30.2 points a game in 1963, is in the stack of 
memorabilia. So are one 1904 player's heavy-duty pants, used to play on an 
outdoor cinder parking lot at Freelandville High. 
</P>
<P>
The hall will chronicle and preserve the heritage of the game as played by the 
thousands of teams in the Hoosier state, and will depict through exhibits, film 
footage and video what basketball means to the state's culture, history and 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Carnegie, long-time track announcer for the Indianapolis 500-mile race, and 
businessman Ray Johnson, both members of the Indianapolis downtown Lions Club, 
came up with the idea of a shrine dedicated to Hoosier Hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the first five of the 250 members of the Indiana Basketball Hall of 
Fame were selected: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wooden, who was on the 1927 Martinsville state championship team. He went 
on to become an All-American at Purdue and coached at South Bend Central High 
before moving to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ward (Piggy) Lambert, Wooden's coach at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Homer (Stoney) Stonebreaker, who played at Wingate, the little school that 
won the championship in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Ernest (Griz) Wagner and player Robert (Fuzzy) Vandenvere of Franklin 
High's Wonder Five that won three state titles in a row, 1920-22. 
</P>
<P>
To be selected to the Hall of Fame, a man or woman must have played or coached 
high school basketball in the state. Among the inductees are nearly 50 who went 
on to play pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
Players become eligible for induction 25 years after high school graduation, 
and coaches are eligible after accumulating 25 years of varsity experience or 
after retirement. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide board of 25 directors, all former high school basketball players or 
coaches, make the selections. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana clings to one-class basketball. Schools compete against one another in 
the state tournament regardless of size. Some years, big schools such as mighty 
Muncie Central, winner of the state title six times, more than any other 
school, are victorious. Other years, tiny schools such as Wingate, Thornton, 
Plymouth and Milan come out on top. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 film "Hoosiers," starring Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper, about a 
small high school winning the Indiana state championship, was inspired by the 
1954 victory of tiny Milan (pronounced here My-lan) over Muncie Central. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the film 'Hoosiers' is concerned, it was one of the best movies ever 
made," Newlin said. "Theaters all over the state were jammed to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, Newlin traveled throughout Indiana, recording the sights and 
sounds of basketball games, capturing the essence of Hoosier Hysteria for the 
hall. He had already recorded chants down through the decades, such as the 
popular "Boom-a-lacka! Boom-a-lacka! Bow-wow-wow!" of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the state is excited about this," he said. "Admission will be 
free, or $1 at the most, with the gift shop and special all-star and old-timer 
hall of fame basketball games providing support along with donations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame will be another chapter of Indiana's 
incredible Hoosier Hysteria."

<TEXT>
   Former Chief Justice Earl Warren, songwriter
Cole Porter, the game of basketball and the effort to explore space
are among the subjects planned for the nation's 1991 postage
stamps.
   The year is expected to lead off with a flower stamp, carrying
no cost denomination, and a so-called make-up-rate stamp.
   New postage rates are expected to take effect in late January or
early February, with a 30-cent first class charge considered
likely.
   But the rate won't be determined until the Postal Rate
Commission reports next month, so non-denominated stamps have been
printed to handle any eventuality.
   As with past rate changes, the stamps carry a letter, and the
progression is up to ``F.'' This stamp will carry a flower design
to match the letter, much as the last such stamp, lettered E,
carried an image of the Earth.
   In addition, the make-up stamp will be valued at the amount of
the cost increase - which means that adding it to a 25-cent stamp
will equal the new rate. The design for this stamp hasn't been
disclosed yet.
   The first regular stamp issue of 1991 will come on Jan. 25 as a
4-cent coil stamp featuring a steam carriage. Part of the
transportation series, the first issue will occur in Tucson, Ariz.
   A 50-cent stamp will be issued Feb. 22 jointly in Washington and
Berne, Switzerland, commemorating Switzerland's 700th anniversary.
   The 200th anniversary of Vermont statehood will be observed in
March with a stamp to be released in Bennington.
   The face value of this and many other stamps to be issued in
1991 will be determined by the decision in the pending rate case.
   On April 1, New York will be the scene for the issue of a postal
card commemorating the 100th anniversary of Carnegie Hall.
   Also in April, a Great Americans stamp will be issued in
Albuquerque, N.M., honoring former Senator Denis Chavez. A stamp
featuring a flag over Mt. Rushmore will be released at Mt. Rushmore
in South Dakota, and a stamp showing the U.S. flag and Olympic
rings will be issued.
   Savings bonds will be featured on a stamp to be issued May 1 in
Washington and another flag stamp will be issued May 30 in
Waterloo, N.Y.
   Honolulu will be the issue site May 9 for two new ``Love''
stamps.
   The annual Literary Arts stamp will feature William Saroyan,
being issued May 22 jointly in Fresno, Calif., and Yerevan, Soviet
Union.
   A Great Americans stamp honoring former Vice President Hubert
Humphrey will be issued May 27 in Minneapolis.
   The Cole Porter stamp will be issued June 8 in Peru, Ind.
   Also in June, the ``Old Red'' administration building at the
University of Texas' Galveston branch will be featured on a postal
card.
   A $1 Olympic logo stamp will be issued in June, and a summer
Olympics set of five stamp designs will be released in Los Angeles
in July.
   The Antarctic Treaty will be featured on an air mail stamp set
for June 21 in Washington.
   A commemorative stamp to honor coin collecting will be issued
Aug. 13 in Chicago.
   A sheet of 10 stamp designs will recall World War II. It i
scheduled for issue in August, but the date and place have not been
determined.
   Springfield, Mass., where basketball was invented, will be the
site for the issuance of a stamp commemorating the birth of that
sport. It will be released Aug. 26.
   Washington will be the site for a District of Columbia
commemorative stamp Sept. 7. The 200th anniversary of the Bill of
Rights will be marked by a stamp to be issued in September in
Richmond, Va.
   And a booklet with five designs honoring comedians also will be
issued in September, the site yet to be announced.
   Space exploration will be commemorated in 10 different stamp
designs, scheduled for release as a booklet Oct. 1 in Pasadena,
Calif.
   A stamped envelope commemorating the magazine industry is
scheduled for issue in Naples, Fla., in October, the same month
that a stamp will appear recalling the World Columbia Exhibition.
   A postal card noting the University of Notre Dame administration
building will be released Oct. 13 in South Bend, Ind.
   The traditional Christmas stamp will be issued in Houston and
the contemporary version in Santa, Ind., both on Oct. 17.
   Dates have not been determined for three stamps. The Earl Warren
stamp, which will be issued in Washington; a Black Heritage stamp
featuring Jan Matzelinger will be released in Lynn, Mass., and a
booklet of five stamps featuring fishing flies also will be issued.
Matzelinger invented a machine that revolutionized the shoemaking
industry.
   A sheet of 50 wildflowers, originally planned for 1991, has been
postponed until 1992.

<LEADPARA>  James Naismith's gym is long gone. But just a few blocks away from where
Naismith tacked up his peach baskets a century ago, his game lives on at the
parquet floor of the Dunbar Community Center.;   To find the white columned
19th century church building that director George "Big Will" Williams likes to
call the "holiest gym in the nation," you have to turn your back on the
Basketball Hall of Fame and head into the bleak blocks up the hill where
George Washington decided to build a munitions plant called the Springfield

<TEXT>     They took the pews out for basketball around 1920 when the Olivet Church,
started nearly a century earlier, fell on hard times and merged with the South
Congregational Church. One condition of the merger was that the old church
become a "community house.";   "Drugs were rampant, unemployment was high, and
the young people had no place to go," Williams said, as some 7-year-olds shot
around underneath the panels illustrating lines from Paul Laurence Dunbar's
poetry that replaced the stained glass windows. "It was started to combat the
same problems we face today.;   "This has always been a working class
neighborhood. And black or white, a lot of the kids couldn't afford other
programs. Our policy is never to turn a kid away.";   For more than 70 years,
Dunbar has kept that trust. More than 300 youngsters are now involved in
basketball, karate, boxing, dance and many cultural programs that all have
gained a measure of national attention. Some of the instructors, including a
University of Massachusetts student named Julius Erving, who put in a
work-study stint in the 1970s, have done all right as well.;   "It's a parent
away from home," Bobbie Best said. Her husband, Leo, who won the trophy given
to the city's top high school basketball player in the 1950s, and son, Travis,
the city's centennial gift to the game, are both in the Dunbar Hall of Fame.
Now at Georgia Tech, where he is considered one of the best freshmen point
guards in the nation, Travis Best led undefeated Central High to the state
high school basketball championship last season.;   Mrs. Best played her
basketball in the church league, but said "Dunbar was and still is the place
to be.";   "It added a lot more to young people's lives than just sports," she
said.  </TEXT>

<LP>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Huffy Corp. Chairman Harry A. Shaw III,
crediting strong mountain bike sales, said he's comfortable
with analysts' estimates of fourth quarter earnings of 25
cents to 27 cents a share.
   In the 1990 fourth quarter, Huffy earned $1 million, or 12
cents a share, on sales of $121.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Shaw said he also agrees with analysts who expect
Huffy to report 1991 earnings of as much as $1.41 a share. In
1990, the bicycle and consumer products company earned $18
million, or $1.28. He expects 1991 sales to come in at $675
million to $678 million, compared with $517 million in 1990.
   Moreover, Mr. Shaw expects the sales growth trend to
continue, with 1992 sales projected to reach between $725
million and $750 million.
   Mountain bike sales have driven much of Huffy's growth,
and now represent 60% of the company's total bicycle sales,
up from 10% four years ago. To maintain sales growth, the
company plans to unveil a new line of bicycles combining
heavy-duty features of mountain bicycles and standard
lighter-weight 10-speed touring bikes.
   "They're for somebody who's not riding a lot off-road,"
Mr. Shaw said. The new line will be priced in the $119-$200
range, while its current line of mountain bikes sell for
between $119 and $300. Huffy is planning a national
television advertising campaign to push the new line in April
and May.
   True Temper Hardware, which Huffy acquired from Black &amp;
Decker Corp. in November 1990, started 1991 "slowly" but had
a "terrific" fourth quarter and December, Mr. Shaw said.
Sales were especially strong in a new line of childrens'
garden tools and adult pruning tools, including shears and
clippers. Huffy expects the hardware subsidiary will have a
"very strong January and a very good first quarter."
   Less impressive were results in the company's inventory
counting subsidiary, Washington Inventory Service. The unit
has suffered management turnover in recent years, but has
stabilized under new leadership. "We're hoping the first
quarter will be an improvement over last year," Mr. Shaw
said. Its Huffy Service First unit lost a major customer,
representing 10% to 15% of the tiny unit's $1 million to $2
million annual earnings, when the customer decided to do its
own retail store displays and products. Still, Mr. Shaw
expects the unit to grow in 1992 as more retailers contract
out for display and product assemblage.
   Sales of basketball backboards grew last year, thanks to
the continuing popularity of the National Basketball
Association, whose name the company licenses, Mr. Shaw said.
A big seller was a stand-alone water-filled backboard system
for residential recreational use.
   Last fall, the company also introduced 25 juvenile
products, which helped boost sales of products such as car
seats, room monitors and baby carriers by 15%, Mr. Shaw said.
Huffy expects to introduce about as many new juvenile
products this year.
   Mr. Shaw said Huffy is in an active acquisition mode.
"We're looking for another consumer durable-product company
that's undermarketed, as we felt True Temper was." Of
particular interest to Huffy are companies, both domestic and
overseas, in the hardware, houseware, lawn and garden, and
juvenile products businesses.

SIKMA'S TRADEMARK WITHERS IN NEW ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS G. BUNN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Motta once said it was the most innovative move he had seen in his 
coaching career, which began in the '50s. In a century or so, some coach will 
run across it while watching videotapes and say, "That was a heck of a move. 
Wonder why it never caught on?" No one has been able to invent a name for it -- 
like "skyhook." It is known simply by the name of its originator -- The Sikma 
Move. 
</P>
<P>
It is not exactly majestic. Even when Jack Sikma was a spry 25, it was, at 
best, jerky. It calls for a 180-degree pivot, a step back, and a shot from way 
behind the head. If someone tries to block it, the pivot foot is still in 
place, so Sikma can fake the shot and go past the defender. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, he still can do the move better than anyone, primarily because no one 
else does it. But he is doing it less these days because in his old basketball 
age Sikma has become a 6-foot-11, 255-pound perimeter center -- sort of a Bill 
Laimbeer with class. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't use it as much anymore," said Sikma, who will be in Madison Square 
Garden when the Milwaukee Bucks play the New York Knicks Saturday. "I'm just 
not in the low post as much anymore. My game has kind of changed." 
</P>
<P>
It says a lot about Sikma that he can make such an adjustment 13 years into his 
career. And he has made it effectively. Last week in a game against the San 
Antonio Spurs, rookie David Robinson chose to double down low and leave Sikma 
unguarded. Sikma responded by converting five three-point shots and scoring a 
season-high 29 points while Robinson had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it seems strange not seeing Sikma down low, whirling around and 
utilizing The Sikma Move. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," he said. "I have found during my career that I get the 
most playing time by doing what the coach tells me to do. So that's what I have 
always done." 
</P>
<P>
Sikma says coaches have shown the most interest in the move. Many have inquired 
about how he invented it (he did it with the help of his college coach). Motta 
used to challenge every big man he coached to learn the move. Some would 
practice it and use it sporadically during games. But Sikma says no player has 
ever asked him about the mechanics of the shot. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that is surprising because the shot is such an effective inside 
technique. For tall players who do not have the leaping ability of Patrick 
Ewing or Akeem Olajuwon, it would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
But then, it also is not surprising because very few players asked Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar to teach them the skyhook. If The Sikma Move included bouncing the 
ball between the legs 50 times, maybe it would have looked cooler and become 
more popular. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, it has only been good enough to help Sikma win a championship (with 
the '79 Seattle SuperSonics) and keep him in the league 13 years. Sikma knows, 
however, that when he retires, the The Sikma Move will become extinct. But he 
doesn't get dramatic about it. "It's a unique shot, and it sets me apart," 
Sikma says. "But that shot and 25 cents will buy you a newspaper, and that's 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true, and there is no doubt is not the most awesome move in the 
history of basketball. It may, however, be what Motta said it is -- the most 
innovative we have seen in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
One move that did not thrill Spurs Coach Larry Brown occurred Wednesday when 
his team signed guard Johnny Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made it clear that it was not his decision. "I'm happy for Johnny after 
what he's been through," Brown said. "But it really hurt to get rid of (Jeff) 
Lebo." 
</P>
<P>
Spurs General Manager Bob Bass made the decision to sign Moore, the popular 
ex-Spur whose career was interrupted in 1985 when he contracted desert fever, a 
rare form of meningitis. Moore, 31, apparently has recovered. He was working 
out with the Continental Basketball Association Tulsa team when Bass called. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Timberwolves guard Pooh Richardson consumes one of the most 
interesting refreshments during timeouts -- honey. I wanted to ask why but 
didn't get the chance. But then, it might have been a dumb question. When you 
think about it, considering his name, it makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
During the world champion Detroit Pistons' recent 88-84 loss to the Miami Heat, 
teammates and buddies Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas had a heated exchange of 
words on the floor. Thomas told Aguirre, "You're blowing it," while the game 
was in progress. Aguirre responded, "You mean I'm losing this game by myself?" 
Later, the two made peace, and because their friendship includes an exchange of 
kisses, it probably is safe to assume they literally kissed and made up. 
</P>
<P>
Once Thomas gets a full dose of the regular-season Aguirre and his massive mood 
swings, it will be interesting to see if their off-court friendship survives. 
It probably will help that Aguirre currently has a sprained ankle that will 
keep him out of the lineup for a while. Absence makes the poison less potent. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre has proven conclusively during his eight-year career that he cannot 
make it through an 82-game season without causing several major and minor 
distractions. The Pistons were on such a roll last season that even Aguirre 
could not disrupt them. But now he has a full season to work. The blowup with 
Thomas occurred before the season was two weeks old. There will be more. 
</P>
<P>
Several general managers are predicting Brian Shaw and Il Messaggero Roma of 
the Italian league will reach agreement on the settlement of his contract 
shortly, and that Shaw will return to the United States and join the Celtics. 
Il Messaggero Roma apparently has let it be known that it is in the market for 
an American guard. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Hawks General Manager Stan Kasten points out that the Italian season 
ends April 14, and if Il Messaggero Roma does not not make the playoffs, Danny 
Ferry could join the Cleveland Cavaliers for the National Basketball 
Association playoffs. "Ferry could be back," Kasten said. "This might help 
Cleveland sooner than anyone thinks." 
</P>
<P>
This observation is rather obvious, but cocaine really did hurt Mitchell 
Wiggins' game. The Houston Rockets guard, who was banned for two years because 
of cocaine use, has averaged nearly 22 points since returning. In his first 
four NBA years, he averaged 9.6 points and his highest average was 12.4. 
Wiggins credits his offensive burst to clean living and hard work. He also 
knows it is going to pay off for him. Wiggins is making only $250,000 and is an 
unrestricted free agent after the season. "Hopefully I can get a job," he said. 
"Do you think I can make some money? I would like to stay in Houston, but I 
might have to test the waters." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rockets Coach Don Chaney said don't be fooled by the eight minutes 
former starter Sleepy Floyd played against the Knicks Tuesday. "He's not in my 
doghouse, if that's what you're wondering," said Chaney, who has fooled a lot 
of people. "He's been struggling, and I've got some young guards I have to make 
decisions on." 
</P>
<P>
Right. You want to find out if Anthony Bowie and Byron Dinkins can play, so you 
bench your starting point guard. Floyd also will be an unrestricted free agent, 
and he was close to signing a new deal with the Rockets. But now, he may not. 
"This definitely will have an effect," Floyd said.

GLOBETROTTERS STILL AHEAD OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Harlem Globetrotters were in town over the weekend to show us how, at 63, 
they haven't aged a bit, and in fact are more than au courant: 
</P>
<P>
The Globies carry a woman on the roster, they play above the rim, and Twiggy 
Sanders' Bingo shot -- a 40-foot hook from the sideline -- may yet find an 
expert practitioner in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The rosters have changed, of course. Show Biz Jackson and the 6-foot-9 Sanders 
now take up the slack of those earlier antic showmen, Goose Tatum and 
Meadowlark Lemon, and young Tyrone Brown takes care of the dribbler's 
legerdemain that was once the incomparable province of Marques Haynes and Curly 
Neal. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the old crowd-pleasing tricks remain. The swift, ever-tightening 
weave at the top of the key, where the ball is popped in to the center who 
kicks it or passes it or bounces it off his head to a cutter who in turn 
finishes with a Hi Slamma Jamma dunk. The trick balls. The long pauses where 
Sanders may toss a vendor's entire supply of Cracker Jacks into the crowd and 
then ask of him "Do you take checks? Good. I'll check with you later." The play 
with children (an eager 5-year-old boy is fetched center court, changed into a 
Globetrotters uniform while the players hold towels discreetly around him, then 
returned to his father, whom Sanders tries to dun for $15 -- which remains 
amicably unpaid). 
</P>
<P>
The Globetrotters play as much as eight games a week -- a crushing schedule 
(NBA teams average three) -- yet for a few minutes of each quarter we get to 
see some very good basketball. The defense of the Washington Generals (the 
Globies' opponents) may be a bit sketchy, but it's clear that the script is 
only partly blocked out and that the players are allowed to spend some time 
really going at it. 
</P>
<P>
Their pleasure -- the inner game -- is in putting moves on each other, 
challenging each other, and there are times when we witness the almost 
breathtakingly beautiful sweep of fine-tuned young players taking a fast break 
downcourt, arcing and cutting like gazelles in an orchestrated stampede that 
climaxes in someone's gorgeous leap to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball may have started as a white game, but once blacks began playing it 
quickly became clear that whites would have to be very good to keep up (and for 
a while they weren't; that's why the Globetrotters went on their own -- they'd 
been frozen out). When we struggle for similes at the sight of an electrifying 
Magic Johnson pass or an Air Jordan glide to the hoop, for a second we always 
think that the miracle belongs in a Globetrotter game. 
</P>
<P>
Only the other night Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: "I grew up in Harlem. I didn't 
know anything about the Lakers or the Celtics when I was a kid. I only knew the 
Globetrotters." 
</P>
<P>
If the game weren't enough, they're also skillful and affectionate clowns who 
find every opportunity to play the crowd. During the intros, Sanders grows 
bored with waiting for his name to be announced and steps off-court to swipe 
somebody's box of nachos and sodas, which he redistributes to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
There is black patois ("Who ball?" Jackson inquires of the referee); ironic 
elegance (ref calls for ball, player responds, "Are you inquiring about the 
availability of a ball?"); impromptu dancing (Tyrone Brown moonwalks through 
the key), and endless improvisatory surprise, whether in low-fiving a youngster 
who can't reach a 7-footer's high-five, or in forming a swift ensemble that 
rushes to either side of the court en masse -- drawing the opposition along -- 
and then leaving the ball behind for a deliberately tardy teammate to scoop to 
the basket. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that makes a Globetrotters appearance a treat is that the 
players themselves are always in search of the adroit move (stocky young 
Quentin Jackson's eyes scanned his own bench after a particularly clever flight 
to the hoop, after which he curled downcourt doing an Ickey Woods finger 
twirl). 
</P>
<P>
Another is that they're such expert practitioners of the game that they can toy 
with its form. There are so many millions of dollars at stake in an NBA 
franchise's season that there isn't always a lot of room for fun (Lakers' show 
time excepted), and the intercollegiate game is even duller. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the Globetrotters to remind us that at the heart of real play 
there's discipline, and at the heart of discipline there's always the freedom 
to play. If they weren't so adept at the structure of the game, turning it 
around, parodying it, they'd be unwatchable. To the extent that theirs could be 
called a deconstructivist approach, they remain at one with the age. (You can 
just hear an incredulous Sanders now: "Say what?") 
</P>
<P>
If the rule of comedy is invention, who would have thought that six decades 
into what is now an institutional franchise, the Globetrotters are still ahead 
of the game?

At 82, He's Still Calling the Shots

   Things were not going well for the boys' basketball team from Keith Country Day School, a small, private institution in Rockford, Ill. 
Short but slow, and erratic to boot, it straggled off the court trailing University Lakes School here, 50-27, at the end of the third quarter Saturday afternoon. 

   "Gentlemen, you are missing your layups and free throws, and you're not helping one another on defense," said coach Dolph Stanley. 
"Does anyone have a suggestion?" 

   When none was proffered, the coach could only shrug. 
"Well, persevere," he said. 
"Persevere." 

   Perseverance is a subject about which Stanley could write a book. 
At age 82, white-haired and rugged, he may not be the nation's oldest active basketball coach, but he surely is close. 

   Moreover, he is one of the winningest coaches ever on the high school and college level. 
Over 52 seasons, his teams at a half-dozen Illinois high schools and at Beloit College, in Beloit, Wis., have posted 952 official victories. 
The total would be 977, but 25 wins by his 1963 team at Auburn High in Rockford were forfeited retroactively when it was discovered that it used an overage player. 

   The forfeit ruling hung on whether a "4" could be discerned on the lad's mangled Arkansas birth certificate: His parents swore he was born on Dec. 24, but the document seemed to read Dec. 2, which put the player on the wrong side of a state eligibility cutoff date. 
"If you held it up to the light, you could see the '4,' " Stanley maintains. 

   Auburn High forgave Stanley the episode (it named its gym after him when he was forced to leave in 1970 on reaching the then-mandatory retirement age of 65), but the ruling still grates because it might keep him from posting 1,000 career victories, something achieved by only a handful of coaches in the sport. 
Academics-conscious Keith has just 30 boys in its high-school division, and while Stanley says they are good kids, he reckons he might have to coach there until he is 100 before accumulating 48 more wins. 

   Upon reflection, though, he allows that he can afford to be generous on the issue. 
"If you include all the freshman, junior varsity and all-star games I've coached, I probably have 2,000 victories," he says. 
"I'd say that's enough for any man." 

   Many of those wins came on a grander stage than that offered by the Southern Wisconsin and Illinois Small Schools (SWISS) Conference in which his present team plays. 
He is the only coach in Illinois history to have taken teams from five different schools to the round of 16 in the state prep tourney, and his 1944 Taylorville squad posted a record 45-0 mark in winning it. 
That win total probably will never be topped, because schools aren't allowed to play that many games anymore. 

   Stanley coached at Beloit College from 1945 through 1957, winning 238 of 295. 
His 1951 team was the smallest school ever to appear in the National Invitational Tournament, then the nation's premier college-hoops event. 
Beloit was so strong during the Stanley era that it was voted out of its conference, so it scheduled, and beat, the likes of DePaul, Loyola, Arizona and Brigham Young. 

   Stanley was athletics director at Drake University in 1958 and '59, a long-enough period to convince him that he preferred coaching to fund raising. 
He coached for 10 years at Auburn High, and, when the school board retired him, he went across town to coach Boylan Catholic High for 10 years. 
Two years of fitful retirement and he was ready to take the part-time coaching job at Keith. 

   In his middle years, Stanley received bids to pilot such big-time places as Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa State and Army. 
He turned them down, and still puzzles over why. 
"It wasn't because I was scared, or, at least, I don't think it was," he says. 
"I guess I wanted to really coach, not recruit and do all the other things big-school men do. 

   "When you're in the high schools and small colleges, you have to deal with the players you get, so you have to be flexible. 
I guess I've taught every offensive and defensive system known to man," he goes on. 
"I've been around long enough to know that there's not much new in basketball. 
A lot of people give John Wooden from UCLA credit for inventing the zone-press defense, but I used it in 1936 at Mt. Pulaski High School. 
Same with that passing offense Bobby Knight uses at Indiana. 
My Taylor ville teams whipped the ball around as good as his do. 

   "I believe that speed is what makes basketball worth watching and playing, and I've always resented the big boys taking over. 
I think we'd have twice the game we do now if someone'd figure out a way to get rid of the backboard. 
Maybe I'd feel different if I'd ever had a good big man, but, believe it or not, I never did. 
Every really tall boy I coached was slow as mud. 
I had one 6-11 kid at Beloit who had promise, but he fell in love and broke his toe the same week. 
Never saw him again." 

   Stanley admits he's not the coach he used to be, if only because he no longer can get out on the floor and demonstrate techniques. 
"You can't tell kids much. 
You've got to show them," he notes. 
He has been on crutches for two weeks now because he was knocked down by a player he was trying to instruct. 
"I was holding him to teach him the stop-and-go, but he took off too soon," the coach says. 

   But despite such setbacks, and just 27 wins in five years (the team is 3-13 this season), Stanley feels he is doing some of his best coaching at Keith. 
The team had just three members when he came. 
It suits up 13 now, unless a school play or ski trip intrudes. 
"We've gone from the gym-class level to junior varsity," Stanley says. 
"At least, when I tell 'em to press now, they know what I mean." 

   And, indeed, the Keith players, none taller than 6-feet-2 ("and he's only that tall because he's got a long neck," Stanley says), did persevere in the fourth quarter against University Lakes and bring the final score to a respectable 55-46.

   An Old-Time Board Game

   In an era when "expensive" and "entertainment" go
together, even (especially?) when children are involved, it's
nice to see that All-Star Baseball is marking its 50th
birthday this year in good style.
   I don't mean the real baseball game that teams
representing the National and American leagues played Tuesday
night in Toronto. I mean the board game, produced by Cadaco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The game is a classic, not in the sense of those
every-week golf tournaments in places like Hattiesburg,
Miss., and Coal Valley, Ill., but by the Webster's New World
Dictionary definition (No. 6) of "continuing in fashion
because of its simple style." Come to think of it, it also
meets the dictionary's definition No. 1, "of the highest
class." Best, it's cheap, usually retailing between $11 and
$15. That's a miniscule price to pay for endless hours of
pleasure.
   I experienced many such hours as a boy, happily choosing
lineups from among the game's best active players (DiMaggio,
Williams, Musial, Kell, Robinson, Schoendienst, Spahn,
Roberts) or such golden oldies as Ruth and Cobb, inserting
the cardboard discs containing the heroes' offensive
propensities into the holder, and plinking the spinner to
determine their, and my, fate.
   This was before (long before) computer games, where
players made of colored dots pitch, hit and run the bases
before our very eyes. But All-Star Baseball is better,
because it's played in the stadium of the mind. What pile of
dots, however animated, can match the thought of Robinson
stealing second base in a cloud of dust, or Musial uncoiling
to slash a double down the right-field line?
   As a lad plinking away, I didn't know, or much care, how
this wonderful game came to be. As a reporter, I found out.
That's a wonderful thing about being a reporter.
   Turns out that All-Star Baseball was invented by a
baseball player; not an All-Star, perhaps, but a very good
one nonetheless. He's Ethan Allen, who spent 13 seasons in
the outfields of the Major Leagues, from 1926 through '38,
with six different teams. Among his achievements was a .300
career batting average. His best season was 1934, when, as a
Philadelphia Phillie, he hit .330 and tied for the National
League lead in doubles with 42.
   Batting .300 is a bigger thing now than in that hit-crazy
period, but the Cincinnati native still stood out, for his
scholarly bent. At a time when collegians were rare in
professional baseball, he earned a bachelor's degree in
education from the U. of Cincinnati in 1927, while a
Cincinnati Red, and a master's degree from Columbia, in 1932,
while a New York Giant.
   Later, he produced films and wrote books on baseball
strategy and technique, and spent 23 years -- from 1946
through '68 -- as baseball coach at Yale. Among his players
was George Bush, a first baseman on the 1947 and '48 squads.
   "George was an excellent fielder and good team man, but
mediocre at bat," says Allen, now 87 years old and living in
Tucson, Ariz. And no, he did not vote for Mr. Bush for
president. "I'm an ex-Republican," he declares.
   Allen got the idea for All-Star Baseball while still
wearing spikes. "It occurred to me that a player's batting
record could be graphed on a circle -- his percentage of
singles, home runs, walks, strikeouts and so forth," he says.
"Once I hit upon that, putting the game together wasn't
difficult."
   Selling it was harder: "Every big toy executive threw me
out of his office at least once," Allen notes. Then, in 1941,
he visited Cadaco, a fledgling Chicago-based firm owned by
the brothers Charles and Donald Mazer and named for their
first initials (C and D and Co.). "Don Mazer heard me out,
banged his desk and said `Good idea] We'll make it]'" the
inventor recalls.
   Allen cemented the deal by delivering agreements from the
top players of the day to use their names and records. No
money changed hands. "I drew up a little form and asked them
to sign," he says. "The ones who did I thanked. To the rest I
said, `We'll do without you.'"
   There's more to that now, of course. A Cadaco contract
with the Major League Baseball Players' Association covers
active players for a 7% royalty, and separate permissions
must be obtained to use such late greats as Ruth, Cobb,
Wagner, Gehrig and Clemente. The Babe's estate collects an
annual fee of $2,000.
   Cadaco still is in Chicago, a division of Rapid Mounting &amp;
Finishing Co., which makes sales-display materials. In
addition to All-Star Baseball, Cadaco produces BasKet, a
basketball game utilizing baskets, spring-operated levers and
a ping-pong ball, and Photo (formerly Photo-Electric)
Football, which uses offensive and defensive play
transparencies to simulate gridiron action. I played both in
boyhood. They're wonderful, too.
   Waymon Wittman, a toy industry veteran, is Cadaco's
president. He says the company doesn't know how many All-Star
Baseball games have been sold, but believes the number surely
runs to several million. Annual sales in recent years have
ranged between 75,000 and 165,000 units. "When Nintendo gets
hot, we drop, and vice versa," he explains. "It also helps
when Toys `R' Us or Kmart features us in their ads."
   All-Star Baseball has its cult aspects, with leagues and a
newsletter. The game is on display at the Baseball Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Nostalgia, too, plays a role in its
prosperity. "At every toy show, at least one buyer'll corner
me to say how much he loved the game as a kid," Wittman says.
"We get letters from men who say their dads played it, they
did, and now their children do."
   There have been attempts to change All-Star Baseball over
the years, with inventor Allen in the lead. He'd like to see
it become more complex, and to that end has fashioned a
multidisc version that provides for balls and strikes,
squeeze bunts, pickoff plays and the like. It was marketed
for a time as Strategic All-Star Baseball, but was withdrawn
for poor sales.
   "The game succeeds for two main reasons: It's simple and
playable," observes Wittman. "After 50 years, I think we'll
keep it the way it is."

   Ten-year-old Kristin Segal wanted to solve
a universal problem, so she decided to make the glue on stamps
taste better by rubbing a banana across the back.
   Robbie Cadle, 10, hates carrying out the garbage so much that he
has set out a project for himself: motorized garbage cans that he
can drive out to the street and back.
   Seth Swanson, 11, wants to make sure he can locate his dog at
night, and he is designing a nighttime dog collar with a light on
it.
   These and other ideas were developed by the fifth-graders at
Dommerich Elementary School as part of the Invent America program,
which seeks to boost the level of creativity and innovation in this
country.
   It may not be possible to teach creativity, but the program
believes that it can certainly be nurtured in schools.
   The privately funded U.S. Patent Model Foundation in Washington
began Invent America a little more than a year ago as part of an
effort to boost the share of inventions patented in this country by
Americans.
   The proportion of patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office to
Americans has dropped from 89 percent in 1966 to 53 percent in
1987. The remainder go to foreign-born inventors who want to
protect their creations in this country.
   The Invent America class is taught at Dommerich one day a week
to each of five classes of gifted students in different grades by
Gil Rowe.
   He came here from Ocoee Elementary School, where he started the
program and had great success. Ocoee won four of Invent America's
nine state awards last year, the most of any school in the country.
   ``We've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old
American ingenuity,'' says Rowe, 44.
   Eleven-year-old Seth is certain that the creativity class works.
   ``Like when you grow up, if you become a scientist, you'll be a
little bit better at it than someone who never had this before,''
he said.
   Besides opening up the innovative process, Rowe says, the
program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented
a device that earned him his classmates' admiration.
   ``Suddenly he became a famous inventor. He just became a totally
different individual,'' Rowe said.
   Only two Orange County schools took part in the program last
year, but two dozen are involved this year, as are others around
the state.
   Four million pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade
participated nationwide in 1987 _ about 13 percent of all students
in those grades, the foundation reported.
   Other inventions have ranged from a self-cleaning bathtub to
salt dyed red so that people can know how much they use.

Custom-Made Audio Tapes
Put Fans in Hero Roles;
Laxalt Wins Wimbledon

   Did you hear about the time President Reagan played shortstop for the Chicago Cubs in a game with the New York Yankees and knocked the ball out of the park in the ninth inning to win the game? 

   Ronald Reagan heard all about it -- on an audio tape presented to him in 1985 by his friend Paul Laxalt, then a senator from Nevada. 

   The tape, a get-well gift, was created by Nat Albright, the proprietor of Fantasy Tapes in Arlington, Va. 
Using recorded sounds such as roaring crowds and cracks of the bat, Mr. Albright did the play-by-play from a script he wrote. 
The resulting cassette sounds like a radio broadcast of an authentic sporting event. 

   Mr. Laxalt ordered the gift for the president after his staff gave him a tape in which he defeated John McEnroe to win the Wimbledon tennis championship. 
That heady experience was also created by Mr. Albright, who explains the appeal a fantasy-sports tape has for presidents, senators and the not-so-celebrated. 
"It allows you to be the star," he says. 

   He adds: "For those who dreamed about playing at the Masters, driving a car in the Indy 500 or playing center court at Wimbledon, they can live the dream with a fantasy-sports tape." 

   Another Washington-area company, Hall of Fame Tapes Inc. of Bethesda, Md., reports brisk demand for similar tapes from business people and others. 
David Landau, a recruiter for a Washington law firm, and Richard Stark, a Roy Rogers franchise manager, started making the tapes out of their love of sports and, Mr. Landau says, because they saw a "tremendous market opportunity" for the items. 
The tapes are sold at prices that range between $50 and $70, depending on how many "stars" are featured on the tape and other extras. 

   Mr. Albright, who began professional sports announcing for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1948 and later announced for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, has been creating sports-fantasy tapes since 1982. 
Since then, he has produced tapes for notables such as former House Speaker Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, cartoonist Gary Trudeau and director-actor Ron Howard. 

   "Trudeau's sister ordered a tape for him. 
He played quarterback for the {Washington} Redskins. 
Tip O'Neill played baseball with the Boston Red Sox. 
Ron Howard played second base for the Los Angeles Dodgers {and} flew all the way out here from California to pick the tape up," Mr. Albright says. 

   Mr. Albright has made "about three or four thousand" tapes since 1982, he says, inventing fictitious horse races, boxing matches and basketball games. 
He has an engineering sound room that can produce noises like a revving race-car engine, a shot-clock buzzer at a basketball game and a crowd's oohs and ahs. 

   Hall of Fame specializes in tapes for companies and corporations to kick off conferences, board meetings and sales presentations. 
"In those specialty sports tapes, we man an entire team with company personnel and typically feature the CEO scoring the game-winning basket or hitting the dramatic ninth-inning home run," says Mr. Landau. 
Some of these companies have included Union Carbide Corp. and General Electric Co. 

   Mr. Landau and Mr. Stark got the idea for the tapes from the high prices that fans were paying to play at camps with retired baseball stars. 
The partners, who have been friends since the first grade, handle the business end of the operation and do some creative scriptwriting, but most of the play-by-play is left to Robert Workman, a professional announcer. 

   A Hall of Fame tape made for Robert Abney, a pediatrician from Jackson, Miss., playing a chip shot in the Masters golf tournament went like this: 

   "The chip is away. . . . 
It looks right on target. . . . 
It has a chance. . . . 
Yes! . . . 
It's in the cup. . . . 
I don't believe it! . . . 
Bob Abney sinks a 30-foot chip shot . . . and is the 1987 Masters champion. . . . 
An amateur, born July 24, 1938, {he} walks over to accept congratulations from a stunned Larry Mize. . . . 
Mize must be very disappointed, but today belongs to Dr. Abney, winner of the green jacket by one stroke over a real pro." 

   In another Hall of Fame tape, Pierre Salinger of ABC News substituted for superstar quarterback Dan Fouts in a fictitious pro-football title game won by the San Diego Chargers. 
The tape was a gift to Mr. Salinger from his son, Steven. 

   "He freaked out," the younger Mr. Salinger says. 
"He is a big Chargers fan. 
He used to own part of the team. 
I'm a big Raiders fan, and that's the team the Chargers played. 
Fouts was injured, and Dad stepped in to throw a last-minute touchdown, recovered the on-side kick and on a halfback option, ran the ball in for another touchdown." 

   Howard Schllosberg, a New York retailing executive, has done a great deal for the fantasy-tapes industry. 
"I've purchased over 100 tapes. 
I ordered a lot of them around Christmas," says Mr. Schllosberg. 

   Most of Mr. Schllosberg's friends who receive tapes want to give other tapes as gifts to their friends. 
"I've had about 20 people who wanted to order tapes," he says. 
One of the orders was destined as a gift for Ivan Lendl and his manager; it featured the tennis star losing to the manager. 

   Creative taping has turned David Hartman, former "Good Morning America" co-host, into the heavyweight champion of the world and has allowed William Leonard, former president of CBS News, to lead the Redskins to Super Bowl glory. 
In another memorable audio fantasy, the chairman of I. Magnin Department Stores hit a homer in the ninth to win the World Series for the New York Yankees. 

   Harvey Freeman, a New York attorney for the Trump organization, received as a gift a tape on which he teamed up with Willis Reed and Walt Frazier to lead the New York Knicks to the 1970 National Basketball Association championship over the Los Angeles Lakers. 

   "It was a fulfillment of a fantasy I have had for a while," Mr. Freeman says. 
"It was a delightful gift for someone who has only played basketball on the playgrounds as a child."

<HEAD>Romanians Claim Oina Inspired Baseball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB GLOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans across America might eagerly be
awaiting the start of the oina season if an American here had not
changed a few rules and renamed it baseball, according to a
Romanian sports official.
   Adding his voice to the decades-old debate over the origin of
baseball, Cristian Costescu said the American pastime derived from
the ancient game of oina, which was introduced to the United States
by a pair of Transylvanians.
   Costescu, president of the new Romanian Baseball Federation,
says the two immigrants from the Romanian village of Alba Iulia
joined the U.S. Army and taught the game to their comrades.
   Among their comrades was a young officer named Abner Doubleday,
who changed a few rules and created baseball in 1839, Cotescu said
in an interview.
   ``We are not saying that Romania invented baseball. We would not
like someone else to tell us oina was invented by others,'' said
Costescu. ``But we are saying this: some little inspiration for
baseball was from oina. Baseball is more sophisticated than oina,
but the structure is the same.''
   Romanians claim oina was invented by shepherds in the first
century and say documents from 1310 describe a variation of the
game called hoina being played in southern Romania.
   Oina has 11 men per side, with one team batting and the other in
the field. Each side is allowed one at-bat, in which all 11 players
take the plate.
   A pitcher is provided by the team at bat and he serves up a lazy
underhand toss. The batter tries to hit the ball as far as
possible, then has to run 120 yards through nine bases.
   But if the batter is tagged by a fielder or hit by a thrown
ball, the fielders can score points _ so teams can score even while
not at bat.
   Oina uses a ball almost the same size as a baseball but filled
with horse hair. The bat is similar to a cricket bat and fielders
do not wear gloves.
   Oina still is a Romanian national sport, with forms of the game
being played in various regions of the Balkan country. Though there
are 1,675 teams around Romania, as opposed to about 15 baseball
teams in the country, its popularity has slumped in recent years.
   ``Fifty years ago everybody was playing oina, all the high
schools and elementary schools,'' Costescu said through a
translator. ``But handball, basketball and volleyball appeared and
oina started disappearing.''
   It has been a quarter-century since the heyday of Eugen Cocut,
the Babe Ruth of oina whose height and huge hands allowed him to
hit powerful shots and fire the ball with terrifying speed.
   If Costescu is successful in his post with the 2-month-old
baseball federation, he may assure that the next Cocut plays
baseball instead of oina.
   Costescu used to head the Romanian Oina Federation, back in the
days when baseball was banned as ``a capitalist sport.''
   That stigma was removed after the December revolution that
overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the baseball federation
was formed.
   ``Baseball will be more popular than oina in cities, but in the
villages oina will remain,'' Costescu said. ``Even though I am the
head of the baseball federation now, oina is always in my heart.''

   I saw an Arena football game at Madison Square Garden here Monday night, but went away disappointed. 
I didn't see anyone try a drop kick. 

   I saw about 70 passes and 58 points. 
I saw football players slammed into the boards, hockey-style. 
I saw a man named Knight perform for a team called the Knights. 
I saw a cockroach crawl past my station at the press table. 
It should have been enough, but it wasn't, because nobody tried a drop kick. 

   You must be of a certain age, and then some, to remember the drop kick, so named because the ball has to be bounced off the turf before meeting the kicker's foot. 
It dates from the time when football players were smaller and the ball was larger, or, at least, rounder. 
They used to kick extra points and field goals that way. 
The fella at the National Football League said that, the best he could find out, the last successful drop kick in his loop was an extra point by Ray McLean of the Chicago Bears on Dec. 21, 1941, in the championship playoff against the Giants. 

   I'm a trifle young to have witnessed that one, but I do remember Pat Page, a former University of Chicago footballer. 
He was white-haired and I was a kid of about 12 when we played catch one afternoon in a Chicago park, but when I asked him to throw me a hard one I was almost knocked down by the result. 
He laughed and said that was nothing, watch this. 
Then he drop-kicked the ball through some goal posts about 50 yards distant. 

   Jim Foster, the Iowan who founded and runs Arena football, had a similar memory of his dad's drop-kicking prowess, so he included in the indoor game's rules an incentive for the form's revival. 
You can do that when you invent a game. 
Drop-kicked extra points are worth two points instead of the usual one, and field goals four points instead of three. 
Sure enough, someone drop-kicked an extra point in last year's "preview" season, and this year Dave Jacobs of the New England Steamrollers got a field goal and three PATs. 

   I called Providence, R.I., where the Rollers are based, to speak to Jacobs, but was told he'd been cut after Friday's game against the Chicago Bruisers. 
"His leg was too strong for our building," said a team spokesman."His {place kick} kickoffs kept going into the rafters." 
That has to be a first of some sort. 

   To be sure, there is more to Arena football than the drop kick. 
The red-haired Foster, 37, has put the autumn game through a shrinker so it can be played in places that are air-conditioned. 
Why should fans have to suffer through a football-less spring and early summer? 

   Foster says this thought occurred to him one evening in 1981, when, taking a break from his duties as NFL promotions director, he was watching an indoor soccer game. 
Anything being better than watching soccer, he then and there whipped out an envelope and jotted down some rules for an indoor football game. 

   Most of those dictums remain: Cut teams to eight men from 11; use a 50-yard-by-85-foot field; retain hockey sideboards because they make for interesting collisions; hoist nets behind the end zones to add spice to kickoff and field goal returns (a ball kicked off a net is in play). 
The latter also saves a few bucks on footballs. 

   Foster was sidetracked from putting his plan into action by the formation of the U.S. Football League. 
Not only did that entity pre-empt summer football, but it also furnished him with employment as a team official. 
The USFL folded after a few, fitful seasons, but Foster says his experience there was useful "because I learned what not to do." 
Including: Don't compete with the NFL in any way, shape or form, and schedule only night games so they don't compete with outdoor summer fun. 

   The new league would have to be started on the cheap, which dictated small rosters. 
That dictated one-platoon football, and that dictated more versatile, and usually smaller, players. 
Typically, linemen change roles with ball possessions, backs become linebackers and receivers become defensive backs. 
"We're a throwback to college football in the 1950s, when guys played both ways," says Foster, proudly. 

   Arena football also is a throwback to the '50s salary-wise. 
Players on the six-team circuit's 18-man rosters get $1,000 a week for a 12-week season, plus bonuses for individual and team performance. 
They also receive housing during the April-through-July campaign. 
Some New York Knights have griped that the faucets leak in their digs, but, given Gotham-area rental prices, they're making do. 

   "It's a wide-open game, and fun to play," offers Matt Stevens, a former UCLA star turned quarterback for the Los Angeles Cobras. 
"I'm hoping for another shot with the NFL, but I won't regret this even if I don't get one. 
I'll have plenty of time later to work 9-to-5." 

   Foster sold his idea to the ESPN cable-TV network (natch), and played a four-team, 13-game inaugural last year. 
Attendance averaged 11,300 a game. 
That figure has dropped to fewer than 10,000 for the first six weeks of this season, partly because of competition from the pro-basketball and hockey playoffs. 
The league expects a gate rebound when it faces just dull old baseball in late June and July. 

   Only about 6,500 people showed up Monday to watch the Knights play the Cobras, indicating, I guess, some sour grapes in the Big Apple over the Knights' 1-4 won-lost record going in (and 1-5 going out; they lost, 36-22). 
The crowd looked mostly like high-school and college boys who came over from school and older guys staying in town after work. 
Still, they cheered for the six-week-old home team (aren't sports amazing?) and had fun making patchy waves. 

   The game, with its narrow field and constant passing, reminded me of nothing so much as the touch football I played in the alleys as a kid ("go to the garbage can and cut left . . ."). Come to think of it, that's not a bad idea for a new TV game. 
The telephone poles will be the goal lines. 
No first downs-only touchdowns. 
No out-of-bounds. 
And drop-kicked extra points'll be worth three. 
Alley football! 
ESPN will love it.

<TEXT>     "Sort of," I answered, because I believe very few people really knew Paul
Brown. But every football person I ever met respected him. This sounds
irreverent, I realize, but if pro football were a revolutionary country like
Cuba, an immense mural of Paul Brown would be hanging over every NFL field in
every NFL stadium. That's how influential the man was.;    And that is why I
have decided to ignore the Pan Am basketball players and gymnasts today and
write about Paul Brown instead. First, because in a previous job I covered and
knew the man for six years, during which he constantly fascinated me. And
second, because he deserves it. Brown forever changed the way football people
think.;    A gross overstatement? Hardly. Paul Brown may not have invented pro
football, but he invented the modern pro football operation, both on and off
the field.;    Let me give you one small example. In 1948, Paul Brown created
the Cleveland Browns franchise in the old All-American Conference. He both
coached and ran the front office. A local television station said it would be
coming out to broadcast one of the team's games. Not so fast, Brown told them.
He would need a few hundred dollars per game.;    "All the other teams were
letting their games be shown for free, just for the publicity and attention,"
he once told me. "I wanted to get the idea established that our games were
worth something.";    Some 40 years later, each NFL team receives tens of
millions of dollars in TV revenue. And when the NFL goes to a pay-per-view
system for the 1999 Super Bowl, remember the man who invented the original
concept.;    Before him, the NFL was a part-timer's league, for coaches who
blew whistles and told their men to grunt and hit people. Brown was the first
man to dissect the game like a science experiment. He was the first to use
game films as strategic tools. He thought too many players were getting broken
noses, so he invented the face mask. He was the first to hire full-time
assistant coaches.;    One of those assistants -- for the Cincinnati Bengals,
the other NFL team Brown coached -- eventually was Bill Walsh. Brown made that
hire in 1968 when Walsh was basically unemployed after the semi-pro franchise
he was coaching in San Jose went belly up. You might say that hiring changed
the course of NFL history.;    The memories I have of Paul Brown are mostly
those of standing alongside him on the sidelines during Bengals practices in
the early 1980s, which he would attend as the team's general manager. He would
relate stories about players he had coached, tell an occasional joke, and
educate me on his philosophy toward the press.;    "I tell the players, 'When
you lose, say little, and when you win, say less,' " he would say.;    "That's
fine," I would say. "It gives me more time to ask questions.";    From time to
time, he would disagree with something I'd write and would fix me with his
patented icy stare. But he was the only sports figure to send us a card when
our first child was born.;    Brown had the image of being a stone-faced
taskmaster. He actually was more of a principled person with old-fashioned
values who had trouble understanding why modern athletes weren't more grateful
to be paid for the privilege of busting up their bodies. Once, Brown fired a
punter at halftime, telling him to take off his uniform and leave the stadium.
Another time, he walked onto a Bengals charter flight before takeoff, sniffed
alcohol on the breath of a player and had him tossed off the plane.;    In the
last six months of his life, knowing he was ill, he tried to close some old
wounds. Last season when Walsh went to Cincinnati to broadcast a game, he paid
a courtesy call on Brown. During the visit, Brown acknowledged that passing
over Walsh as the Bengals' head coach in 1975 was one of the larger mistakes
of his life. His last instructions, knowing he was dying, were that the
Bengals not interrupt their workout schedule for his funeral.;    I'm changing
mine, though. After I finish writing these words, I plan to take a stroll up a
nearby hill. The University of Havana is located there. I have heard that in
the 1940s, the school had an American football team that played against
schools from Florida. There is a small stadium on campus that, from the
configuration and construction, looks suspiciously like it once contained an
American football field. I want to go up there and think about Paul Brown for
a few minutes. I figure that's the least I can do.  </TEXT>

   The unusual has come to be regarded as typical in the NCAA basketball tournament, so it flabbergasted few that the collegiate championship of the state of Kansas was played out here Sunday before 31,000 witnesses who half-filled a vast, silver-domed stadium built for football. 

   Kansas vs. 
Kansas State it was, for the fourth time this season and the 214th since Dr. Naismith, the game's inventor, first hung out the old peach basket. 
He used to coach at Kansas, you know, or maybe you didn't. 
Anyway, Kansas, which had placed third in the recent Big Eight conference race, won the tourney's Midwest regional final over State, 71-58, to qualify for next weekend's Final Four in Kansas City. 
That's in Missouri (you knew that), but it's close enough to home to make 'em the home team. 

   Kansas State had placed second in the Big Eight and had beaten its ancient sparring partner by 15 points a couple of weeks ago, but the turnaround seemed routine to Kansas coach Larry Brown. 
"Losing last time made us want to redeem ourselves. 
I think it helped," he said. 
I guess you have to be a coach to understand that. 

   To be sure, the experts who planted the regional's seeds foresaw a different outcome. 
They seeded Purdue, the Big 10 champ, No. 1 and Pitt, the Big East winner, No. 2. (K State was seeded fourth and Kansas sixth.) 
But Pitt was the pits against Vanderbilt in the second round, and K State upset Purdue in Friday night's semis just after Kansas beat Vandy. 
If those two results had been reversed, we'd have seen Purdue face Perdue, the latter being the surname of Vandy's center, Will. 
Will's a senior, so headline writers never will get a crack at that one. 

   One well might ask how a state like Kansas, which contains about 1% of the U.S. population, got 25% of the quarter-finalists in the annual college hoops classic. 
The answer is the jet airplane. 
Kansas's roster contains players from Los Angeles, Oakland and Santa Monica, Calif.; Washington; Houston; and Greensboro, N.C., among other places. 
State's matriculants hail from cities as distant as Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

   The State star, husky forward Mitch Richmond (try saying that three times fast), is from Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., by way of a community college in Moberly, Mo. 
"Having lived in Moberly helped me appreciate Manhattan," he said in explanation of his college choice. 
The Manhattan in question, of course, is in Kansas, not the island off New Jersey. 

   The Kansas star is Danny Manning, formerly of Greensboro, N.C. Coach Brown wanted him so badly he hired Danny's dad, Ed, as an assistant coach a year before he signed the son. 
The 6-foot-10 Danny, a senior, has been a Manning among boys in his four years at Lawrence, Kan., averaging almost 20 points a game to set the Big Eight career scoring record. 
State's tenacious zone defense guarded him front, back and sides on Sunday, but it couldn't get on top of him and he put in his usual 20 to lead all scorers. 

   Manning's excellence is Kansas's "given," however, and it was the effort of two other players, Milt Newton and Scooter Barry, that keyed the win. 
Newton, a native of the Virgin Islands and a resident of Washington, is a skinny forward whose previous main distinction was that he is the only athletic Newton who isn't nicknamed "Fig." 
He didn't get a chance to really strut his stuff until an injury to another player opened a lineup spot in the season's ninth game. 

   On Sunday, Newton scored 18 points and added a game-high nine rebounds and seven assists. 
More importantly, his defense bugged Richmond into an 11-point afternoon, less than half his season's average of 22.9. 

   As State's zone sagged on Manning in the late going, it was Newton who got the big baskets. 
A couple of three-pointers by him helped his team pull from even to a 54-46 lead between the 10- and seven-minutes-to-go marks, and with three minutes left and State threatening to make it close again, he rebounded a missed free throw and banked in a 10-footer to start a clinching, eight-point run. 

   "I was tickled to see Newton put up that shot. 
I was scared he'd pass it out and let them run the 45-second clock," said State coach Lon Kruger. 
"I was gonna yell at him" for shooting, agreed Brown. 
But it went in, muting the criticism. 
"It's a shot I make all the time," said Newton in smiling innocence. 

   Barry is an equally interesting character. 
His father is Rick, the NBA Hall of Famer, but Scooter has mostly warmed the bench in college, triggering unflattering comparisons. 
He admits these used to bother him, and caused him to do things like shoot his free throws one-handed instead of with his dad's familiar underhand scoop in order to dampen the scent. 

   But the 21-year-old junior guard says that with maturity has come a greater appreciation of his own talents and limitations, and more success on court. 
On Sunday, he scored 15 points, five more than his previous career high, including a three-pointer at the first-half buzzer that cut State's lead to two, and some key points down the stretch. 
"I should have played him more earlier in the season," said his coach in a rare compliment. 

   Brown took Kansas to the Final Four in 1986, where it was eliminated in the semis. 
He says this year's trip with a team with 11 losses and 25 wins is sweeter. 
"That year we had the people to win it all, and I was disappointed we didn't. 
Early this season, when we were 12-and-8, I had no inkling we'd be going again. 
I thought we'd be lucky to host an NIT game." 

   For Richmond, unsung hero of an equally unsung team, the loss was disappointing in more ways than one. 
Newspeople had struggled all season with his name, calling him things like "Rich Mitchman." 
When he was named to the all-tourney team here, it was as "Milt" Richmond, perhaps in confusion with his Kansas tormentor. 

   Don't worry about the young man's future, though. 
Ex-pro Bob Lanier says he'll eat his shoes if Richmond doesn't make it in the NBA, and that's saying a mouthful. 
Lanier wears a size 19.

MORNING BRIEFING: LASORDA HAS TALE FOR MOST EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Ferguson and the rest of the Dodger coaches were honored at a luncheon 
benefiting the Hollenbeck Youth Center Thursday, reminding some of a story 
Manager Tom Lasorda likes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was catching for the Dodgers during a game at Dodger Stadium, Mickey 
Hatcher was playing third base and there was a runner on third with two out. 
Normally, if a grounder is hit to third in that situation, the play is to first 
for the easy out. 
</P>
<P>
"A grounder was hit to Hatcher, and I'm getting ready to watch his throw to 
first," Lasorda said. "If you're the catcher on the play, you run down to first 
to back up the throw. 
</P>
<P>
"So where does Hatcher throw the ball? He throws home. And the amazing thing is 
Fergie is there to make the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Hatcher comes off the field and I say, 'What the hell are you doing throwing 
home with two outs,' and he says, 'I thought there was one out.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I turn to Ferguson and say, 'Why weren't you running to first to back up 
the throw?' 
</P>
<P>
"And Fergie says to me, 'When you play with dummies you have to think dumb.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the NBA All-Star records for most field goals attempted 
and most field goals made in a single game. (Answer to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
A network executive was somewhat taken aback the other day when Harold 
Rossfields Smith, who served four years for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells 
Fargo Bank, called to pitch Olympic middleweight Roy Jones Jr., whom he said he 
was promoting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he obtained a promoter's license, Smith said: "My problem wasn't 
boxing, it was banking." 
</P>
<P>
From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on schools who have said they 
voted yes on Proposal 42 by accident: 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anyone who voted for Proposal 42 on purpose? Maybe you ought to 
have to score 700 or higher on the SAT to qualify as a delegate to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention. Some of the delegates to this month's 
convention apparently could not spell cat if you gave them a three-letter head 
start." 
</P>
<P>
From Bob Smirzik of the Pittsburgh Press: "This is greed: About the same time 
his agent said no to a $2-million offer from the Boston Red Sox, pitcher Roger 
Clemens was charging $8.50 for an autograph in the Boston area. How much money 
to you need, Roger?" 
</P>
<P>
Talk about stretching for an angle. This comes from a CBS-TV press release: 
</P>
<P>
"Although George Washington and Abraham Lincoln weren't around when Dr. James 
Naismith invented the game of basketball in 1891, the former chief executives 
would undoubtedly have enjoyed watching two of the NBA's best teams battle on 
the day commemorating their births. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were alive and owned a television, they could do just that when 'The 
NBA on CBS' presents the Houston Rockets at the Cleveland Cavaliers, live on 
President's Day, Monday, Feb. 20." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Pete Maravich did, indeed, score 66 points for LSU against 
Tulane on Feb. 10, 1969, and the score of the game was, indeed, 110-94, but it 
was Tulane that won, not LSU, as reported here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rick Barry holds the record for most field goals attempted, 27 
in 1967, and Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan share the record for most 
field goals made, 17. Chamberlain got the record in 1962 and Jordan tied it 
last year.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   They're Rooting for Home Team in Hogland

<LP>
   Fayetteville, Ark. -- As its many supporters will tell
you, the University of Arkansas is a faaaahn institution, one
whose innovations have made lasting contributions to human
betterment. Take, for instance, the light-pole meter
developed a half-dozen years ago by Jim Robken, the school's
band director, to measure crowd noise. Without it, basketball
fans in many places would be in the dark about how much of an
uproar they're creating.
   "I didn't invent it alone -- a friend from Fort Smith who
knows electronics did the wiring -- but it was my idea," says
the trim Robken, who does his game-day conducting in shorts
to faciliate the rousing, round-the-court laps he runs to the
tune of the William Tell Overture during Razorback timeouts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He adds: "Being able to visualize noise gives the fans
more incentive to cheer. They tell me it really helps them
get into the game."
   While Robken, et al., are lighting it up in the stands at
Barnhill Arena these wintry afternoons, the fellas on the
floor are doing their bit, too, and if they keep it up they
also might come up with something new. That would be a
first-ever NCAA crown for their school, and for the entire
Southwest Conference. Sure, basketball traditionally has been
the fourth-favorite sport in these parts, behind football,
spring football and football recruiting, but you'd have
thought that at least one SWC club would have lassoed the
trophy during all these years.
   That this finally might be Arkansas's -- and the SWC's --
year has occurred to many: The Hogs are ranked No. 2 in the
land, behind only defending-champ Nevada-Las Vegas. That it
had better be their year for their conference to benefit has
occurred to all, because beginning next season the school is
taking its business to the Southeastern Conference as part of
the continental drift that's remaking the bigtime college
sports map.
   "It'd be nice to go out (of the league) a winner," muses
Nolan Richardson, Arkansas's coach. "Of course," he smiles,
"I can think of lots of reasons it'd be nice."
   On Sunday, before the usual Barnhill full-house of
9,000-odd people, Richardson's lads took a sizable step
toward that goal by beating Houston, the second-best team in
their league, 95-79. They did it in typical fashion, which
means they swiped everything but the visitors' shoelaces.
Their hounding defense created 11 steals and 28 turnovers,
some of which they turned into points so fast that if you
blinked you missed seeing the scoreboard change.
   The win ran the Razorbacks' won-lost record to 13-1,
promising the continuing improvement that has been their lot
since Richardson arrived here for the 1985-86 season as the
school's, and the SWC's, first black head basketball coach.
   This hasn't come about without some travail. The Hogs went
12-16 in Richardson's first campaign, which was less than
pleasing to fans who had tasted Final Four glory (in 1978)
under his predecessor, Eddie Sutton. But the victory total
has risen annually since -- to 19, 21, 25 and last year's 30
and a Final Four berth -- emboldening the authors of the
team's media guide to gush that the coach is "approaching
legendary status" in Hogland.
   Legendary or not, Richardson is every inch the modern
college-hoops honcho. A dapper man who favors sharp-pressed
suits, shiny cowboy boots and Frenchcuffed shirts, he throws
his recruiting net so wide that his present scholarship list
includes half as many players from Yugoslavia (one; red-shirt
freshman Davor Rimac) as from Arkansas (two).
   And when he says he treats his players "like family" once
they're here, it's no idle boast: The sister of his star
guard, Lee Mayberry, is married to one of Richardson's sons.
   What the coach asks in return is simple. "He wants us to
play our butts off every minute we're on the floor," says
Mayberry, a junior from Tulsa. "You get tired, you sit down.
That's the rule."
   Indeed, Richardson throws his Razorbacks at opponents in
human waves, substituting so liberally that 10 or more of his
players average 10-plus minutes a game. The idea, he says, is
to disrupt foes' "rhythm" by forcing them to play faster than
they're used to.
   And spreading the work has its own rewards. "The other
team can substitute, too, but our subs usually are readier
'cause they've seen more action," Richardson avers. "Also,
we're in shape because every day we practice as hard as we
play. I see to that."
   To handle such a pace, Richardson has assembled a crew
consisting mostly of skinny-legged whippets, but this can
have its drawbacks; to wit, a tall, rugged team that doesn't
panic can give the Razorbacks trouble. Their only loss this
season, in the finals of the NIT tournament, was to muscular
Arizona, which out-rebounded them, 54-32.
   For a half on Sunday, Houston threatened to repeat that
lesson. The Cougars trailed by just four points at the break
-- 43-47 -- mainly because Alvaro Teheran, their 7-foot-1
Colombian center, parked himself under the basket and scored
16 points, 10 on tip-ins or follow-up shots. "Teheran
terrorized us," said Richardson, pun apparently intended.
   In half two, though, Arkansas zipped in and out of zone
defenses that kept the ball away from Teheran (he scored just
two points more) and the Cougar guards on their heels. The
Hogs clinched the win with a two-minute, 11-1 scoring run
that upped their lead to 79-62. It was triggered by an
alley-oop basket by Mayberry off a Todd Day in-bounds pass
following a timeout in which bandmaster Robken spurred the
fans to light the uppermost bulb on his cheer-meter.
   Afterward, Richardson clucked in admiration of the
6-foot-2 Mayberry, whose 27 points tied him for team scoring
leadership with the 6-8 Day. "Other guys jump as high as they
can. Lee jumps as high as he needs to," he said of his
tightly wound playmaker.
   And the coach tipped his hat to the fans. "We run our
press better here, where they're behind us," he said. "Maybe
we'd better charter a train to take a whole bunch of them to
Indianapolis when we go."
   Indianapolis is the site of this year's Final Four.

   Roger Hall's Breakaway Bases
   Protect Ankles in Slides;
   But Baseball Isn't Buying

   ELIZABETHTOWN, Pa. -- Baseball has many heroes. Roger Hall
isn't one of them.
   He might, however, hold two baseball records, if
statisticians knew about them. He's probably slid into bases
more times than Lou Brock, and he's probably toiled more
often in the field of dreams than Ray Kinsella.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For years, Mr. Hall has been tinkering on what he calls
"Rogers Break Away Bases," baseball bases that are designed
to pop up under extraordinary force and thus reduce injuries
that can result from bad slides. He began his crusade when he
watched a friend tear out a kneecap sliding into a standard,
stationary base. "It was horrible," the wiry former infielder
and Elizabethtown College volunteer coach recalls. "I went
right out to find bases that might be safer. But I couldn't
find anything and decided I'd have to rig something
together."
   In Mr. Hall's perfect world, his base would work something
like this: Rickey Henderson gets a late jump trying to steal
second and has to slide hard to avoid a strong throw from the
catcher.
   Ordinarily, players hate to slam into traditional bases
this way for fear of injuring a knee, ankle or wrist, when
they slide headfirst. But this ball park is equipped with
"Rogers Break Away Bases."
   The Oakland outfielder's wrist rams into the base well
ahead of the tag. The sell-out crowd gasps, thinking he'll be
hurt. Instead of the all-star's joints buckling, the base
gives with a pop-pop-pop, detaching completely from the
rubber plugs holding it down on the field. Mr. Henderson, who
maintains contact with the flush-mounted rubber plate still
in the ground, stands unhurt and waves to the cheering crowd.
   It's a good dream, one that could have made Mr. Hall a
hero. But though he's found success in one unlikely sector --
the U.S. government -- baseball has been mostly unresponsive.
Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly says flatly, "Who needs
them?"
   According to medical reports, plenty of people do. A
two-year University of Michigan study found Mr. Hall's bases
virtually eliminated base-path injuries on amateur diamonds
around Ann Arbor, Mich., while fields that used traditional
stationary bases saw one sliding injury every 14 games.
   In 1988, the Centers for Disease Control calculated that
breakaway bases could save $2 billion a year in medical
treatments to the more than 40 million Americans playing
organized ball every year. That's more money than the federal
government spent last year on AIDS research and treatment.
   What Mr. Hall didn't realize is that change comes slower
to the national pastime than pitches from a sore-armed
reliever. The National Hockey League adopted detachable,
magnetized goals five years ago to cut down on injuries. The
National Basketball Association went to breakaway rims when
ill-timed slam dunks raised the potential for player harm.
   But baseball treats its past with holy reverence, and the
15-inch-square bags that give the game its name are sacred.
"Baseball looks at innovations like these bases and asks, `If
the game has worked for the past 100 years, why change it?'"
says Bill Deane, a history reseacher at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. "It's a very
conservative sport."
   Indeed, the Official Baseball Rules covering bases haven't
changed significantly in the past 104 years, though people
have often tried. In 1875, John C. O'Neill of St. Louis
patented an "Enunciating Base." It featured a built-in bell
so "the touching of the base by the runner is clearly
announced to the umpire," thereby avoiding "dissatisfaction
and squabbles arising from erroneous observations and
decisions."
   More than 70 years later, two inventors devised a base
without "hazardous corners and side walls." Baseball has also
seen detachable bases -- in velcro, which didn't work once
they got dusty, and with magnets, made by the inventor of the
detachable hockey net.
   Mr. Hall has spent 17 years perfecting his base. In the
early stages of his work, he sold his house and moved with
his wife, Wilma, into a cramped mobile home. There he tested
model after model, sliding into them on his small, sloping
lawn. To keep going, he took odd jobs, like painting houses
and running deliveries around this small, Pennsylvania Dutch
town. He sold his wife's Ford Pinto, and, for a time, gave up
meat.
   "It got to the point where we couldn't afford to go to the
dentist and I stopped buying clothes for myself," Mrs. Hall
says. "It was very depressing, but something said to us to go
on a little further. His dream was so strong and I just
prayed the Lord would carry us through."
   Last month, the Halls thought some of their prayers had
been answered when top officials from two major league teams,
the Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, expressed serious
interest in trying the bases. The Blue Jays used them on
fields at their Dunedin, Fla., spring training complex. Both
clubs agreed to use them with some of their minor league
clubs.
   "If we save just one player who the organization's spent a
lot of money to develop, these bases are worth the money,"
says Bob Gilson, general manager of the London Tigers,
Detroit's class AA farm team. "Then when these guys get to
the pros and start earning $1 million a year the stakes get
even higher. The players become assets teams have to
protect."
   In one recent game, a London Tiger outfielder thought he
was certain to injure his legs on a hard slide into third.
   "I knew I was going to jam something, but then the base
just came off and tumbled a few feet away," says 23-year-old
Steve Green. "Those bases may have kept me from really
hurting myself, but I wouldn't have known they were there
otherwise."
   But Mr. Hall had his sights set on the majors, not the
minors. Problem is, by the time a player is in the big
leagues, he knows how to slide. Detroit shortstop Alan
Trammell says he can't think of anyone who was seriously hurt
because of the traditional bases, held down by steel posts in
cement anchors. American League President Bobby Brown wrote
this to the Centers for Disease Control: "In my experience,
sliding injuries . . . resulting from abrupt violent contact
with the base by the runner has not been a problem in
professional baseball."
   Still, there are millions of Americans playing ball in the
minor or little leagues or on city and suburban recreational
fields. Wouldn't their organizations want to prevent
base-path injuries to baby Ruths and middle-aged Mantles?
   The Little League and the American Softball Association
seem to have nothing against the concept, but they want
royalties in exchange for endorsements. The Little League
asks 5% on the sale of each base. It's a price the
financially strapped Mr. Hall says he can't possibly pay.
   The city of Tucson, Ariz., has been a firm believer in Mr.
Hall's bases. But recently, city officials sent back a number
of them saying they had come unglued. The quality problems
scared a lot of recreational directors on thin budgets; a set
of three Break Away bases costs nearly $400, compared with
$80-$160 for ordinary ones.
   Mr. Hall says quality will no longer be a problem, now
that he's finally wrested his product from the company that
was producing them.
   Though spurned by the majors so far, Mr. Hall did find one
big-league fan: the U.S. government. Last year, the safety
benefits of breakaway bases were the subject of a House
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Testimony there led to
the use of the Rogers Break Away Base at several military
bases and federal penitentiaries.
   Keith Marshall, sports specialist at a minimum-security
prison in Florida, praises Mr. Hall's bases: "People come
into an institution like this not knowing how to slide, and
you get plenty of ankle injuries in the intramurals and
leagues and tournaments we have with outside teams," he says.
"I'm a firm believer."

MIKE DOWNEY: NO DEFENSE FOR THE WAY NUGGETS HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
America's Funniest Home and Away Basketball Team, the Denver Nuggets, will soon 
be appearing at a gymnasium near you! 
</P>
<P>
They're fast! They're funny! They're the Rocky Mountain Globetrotters! These 
crazy Colorado cagers are a laugh-a-minute, point-a-second riot, so don't miss 
one hilarious trip down the court! One of them could end up on your lap! So 
order your tickets today, before Denver is laughed right out of the league! 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you thought the Nuggets were a scream when they played for Doug Moe? Just 
wait until you get a load of these guys under nutty professor Paul Westhead. 
They play basketball the way Jerry Lewis plays Shakespeare. Daffy Duck is more 
subtle. This team is so funny, every radio broadcast should end with: 
"Th-th-that's all, folks!" 
</P>
<P>
They're the enver Nuggets. Westhead took away the D. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a team that never gets penalized for illegal zone defense . . . because 
the Nuggets don't even play legal defense. They should use three balls, like a 
juggler. We knew this team had new owners; we just had no idea they were Barnum 
and Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
These people have become more entertainers than basketball players. They should 
call their leading scorer Meadowlark Woolridge. One of these days, a television 
camera is going to catch Westhead diagramming a play on the sideline, and it'll 
be that one where somebody hides the basketball underneath his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's idea of stopping the other team from scoring is to call a timeout. 
Westhead is one of the few coaches alive who believes the best defense is a 
good offense. The Nuggets don't run plays, they run wind sprints. About the 
only call a referee can make on the Nuggets is 3/10ths of a second in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Don't you just love these guys? The way they hop around all over the place? 
Watching a Denver game is like watching dogs chase Frisbees. The Nuggets 
shouldn't play in a gym. They should play in a Jungle Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how Denver players call a play? They hold up one hand and say: 
"Here I am! Here I am!" 
</P>
<P>
Drop back on defense? Tennis players change sides more often than Denver 
Nuggets do. They are Bobby Knight's worst nightmare come true. Westhead 
believes basketballs were made to be shot into baskets. If James Naismith 
wanted it to be passed, he would have played with a medicine ball. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead has one prerequisite for shooting the ball: A player should remember 
to report into the game. Otherwise, anything goes. The coach just hates it when 
guys shoot from the bench. Screws up the official scorer. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's Laker-Nugget game, we checked in with McNichols Arena's regular 
official scorer, Ed Zupp, to ask if his job has been difficult. Ed told us: 
"Get away from me! I can't talk now! Damn! I missed that one! Who got that last 
basket? Davis? No, Dunn! OK, I got it! Oh damn, there's another one! Who got 
that one? Johnson? Which Johnson? Damn! Go away! I can't talk to you now!" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Denver does use a zone defense sometimes. It's a new one: the 5-0-0. 
</P>
<P>
One team scored more than 100 points against the Nuggets this season -- in the 
first half. At halftime, the trainer rolled their tongues back into their 
heads, like carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Clippers the other night, Seattle scored 65 points. Against Denver, 
the Clippers will try to hold the leading scorer to 65 points. 
</P>
<P>
Can't wait to catch tonight's Nugget-Laker rematch. Should be the funniest 
thing at a Forum since Zero Mostel. These guys won't keep Sam Perkins out of 
double figures. These guys couldn't keep Marlon Perkins out of double figures. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Westhead's strategy has laid a Denver omelet. Last we looked, the 
Nuggets were something like 1-9. Whichever team they defeated probably joined 
the Continental Basketball Assn. or the Foreign Legion or something. 
</P>
<P>
Losing to Denver is disgraceful these days. They are so much less than they 
were under Moe, they should be called the McNuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but when Westhead coached Magic Johnson, the player wanted to run, the 
coach didn't. Now, Johnson says he doubts he could run Westhead's current 
offense because he is too old to run so much. Only Paul Westhead could make 
Magic feel like Methuselah. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's final score, oddly enough, was Lakers 122, Nuggets 105. No, that 
wasn't a partial score. Yes, the Lakers did use five players. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead's blank-page playbook worked at Loyola Marymount. Who knows? Maybe his 
offense will work at Denver, although in our opinion the only thing that should 
be moving that fast at that altitude should have wings and a stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
We wish the Nuggets luck. Next year's playoffs should be the best ones they've 
ever watched.

   Shirley Flower Sedgewick, who married Howard Sedgewick, George's
classmate at Country Day, recalls the strong patriarchal presence
of Prescott Sr. when the dating game began for the Bush boys:
```Now don't you think it's time to take this young lady home?' he
would say, and immediately the family chauffeur, Alex, would be
called into action.''
   The word ``preppy'' had not been invented when 13-year-old
George went off to Phillips Academy here in Andover and became a
``prep,'' the campus word for newcomer. He wore a little blue
rowing cap topped with a white button, carried the luggage of the
lordly seniors to their dorms on the upper hill, burst immediately
into any song they commanded, could not venture near the flag staff
where upperclassmen were allowed to smoke, and was not to be seen
on Main Street until the football team beat Exeter, ``the hated
redmen from the north.''
   ``In those days Andover consciously imitated the English public
schools like Eton and Rugby, so a little hazing was in order,''
said retired English master Hart Leavitt. He remembers George as an
``indifferent scholar. In my class he was a nonentity, just sat
there and didn't contribute much. A nice guy but that's about all.
He looked like the cover on the Preppy Handbook that came out
awhile ago. I didn't have much contact with him outside class, but
I must say wimp is the last word I would apply to him.''
   Chemistry tutor and basketball coach Frank DiClementi, who knew
George better back then, has different memories. ``From the first
day I saw him, I knew he was something special. He came from a
family with the right priorities. Some kids aren't ready to come
here. He was. I never saw him down. Always hustling, but a good
loser although you couldn't be jolly about the damn thing.''
   Wearing the bow tie that is his trademark, ``Deak,'' as decades
of old grads call him, sat on the porch of the Andover Inn
summoning up the past from the background shouts of the playing
fields.
   ``Poppy was captain of baseball and soccer, played every minute
of every game, but I had to talk him into going out for basketball.
He was afraid of denying another kid a place on the team. He was a
good hacker, as we called regular fellows, always thinking of
others.
   ``There was a Jewish kid nicknamed `Ovie' _ dead now _ who left
school when he didn't get tapped for any of the Greek societies.
They talked him into coming back, and Poppy was the first to
befriend him, got him to come out for baseball. One day a fly ball
bounced off Ovie's head into the left-fielder's glove and Poppy
congratulated him on an assist.''
   George and his schoolmates trod the leafy walks in fear of the
righteous wrath of ``The Bald One,'' headmaster Claude Fuess, who
could ring down the thunder for violating 9 p.m. lights-out curfew
or after a bun fight in ``the beanery,'' as the dining rooms in the
student Commons were called.
   The boys often had a tough time keeping a straight face when
campus cutup John Uhler Lemmon III deftly mimicked the head's
portentous waddle. Jack, a year behind George, later made a career
of his comic skills on Broadway and in Hollywood.
   Coming of age in Andover, ``the inmates'' boasted of making the
most of the weekly tea dance to gratify the ``old B.U.,'' defined
in the 1942 Pot Pourri, George's yearbook, as ``the biological
urge.''
   ``The music is usually fair, but the girls are not,'' the class
social historian observed. ``By 8 p.m. the couples are to be found
mostly in the bird sanctuary or in the girls' cars, while faculty
wives attempt to police the affair.''
   As the decade of the '40s began, the outside world intruded on
the lovely wooded and landscaped campus where Oliver Wendell Holmes
first dabbled in verse and where Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose
husband taught here, lies buried in the little graveyard.
   ``Upper-middles,'' third-year boys like George, huddled under
blankets to listen to the war news from Europe on ``contraband''
radios.
   Besides morning chapel and nightly bed check, student activities
included air raid drills and drawing the blackout curtains. Younger
masters were leaving to join the Royal Canadian Air Force, and one
day at assembly a refugee named Heinz Langerhans told in a thick
accent about life in a Nazi concentration camp.
   By senior year, crew cuts were in fashion, and Petty girls
adorned the dorms of this academy founded in 1789 for ``the
virtuous pious education of youth.''

PEOPLE: AGE DOESN'T SIDELINE MAN STILL DRAWN TO BASKETBALL

John J. Reeves has fine-tuned his body by playing tough half-court basketball 
three nights a week at the Santa Ana YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
He's not much of a shooter but says he can pop in a 10-footer every so often. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his shooting touch, "he's our hero," said attorney Stewart 
Suchman, 48, of Laguna Hills, one of the jocks who plays hard-nosed ball with 
him during those two-hour get-togethers under the hoop. "He's our inspiration," 
Suchman said. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves will turn 70 on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates are young enough to be his children. Maybe his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing basketball with the same group of guys for (eight years). 
Most of them don't think about my age," said Reeves, who sometimes gets a 
helping hand if he gets knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll pick me up," he said, "but if I felt they were showing me preference, 
it would be time to do something else." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves learned to set a fancy pick for the hot shooters and enjoys playing 
defense and making good passes. 
</P>
<P>
How does it feel being the veteran? 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't mind, I don't mind. I can hold my own," said Reeves, who retired 
a few years ago but still works as a consultant for Bekins Moving &amp; 
Storage, his employer for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He also owns a small advertising agency that he hopes to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing basketball ever since I met him," said Mary Reeves, his wife 
of 40 years. They form a mutual admiration society. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way (playing basketball) happens is to be blessed with a good wife 
who lets me do it," John Reeves admitted. He and Mary have two sons and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
While he enjoys playing basketball, Reeves said, he was never good or tall 
enough to make his high school team, let alone the team at USC, where he earned 
an industrial design degree. He is six feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he played in pickup games at school and during his service in the Navy 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a pilot but found out I got airsick and ended up as a 
electrician's mate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life, Reeves, a self-described jock, played basketball any time 
there was a pickup game going, and when there wasn't, he would play golf or 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of strange, but I get more tired playing a round of golf than 
playing a hard game of basketball," said the Diamond Bar resident, who does 15 
minutes of stretching exercises before each game. "I really don't get that 
pooped playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said his doctor gave him some simple advice: "He says if I can do it, 
keep it up, and so far, nothing has gone wrong."

FT  01 JAN 94 / Sport: Soccer competes with a freak show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's rough in Washington DC. The American football team is pathetic this
year, the basketball team cannot find the basket, nobody cares about the
toothless ice hockey club and we have not had a baseball team for nearly a
quarter of a century (we will not have a football team either if Jack Kent
Cooke, the owner, moves the Redskins to some racetrack in Maryland).
But we are not alone; it is rough all over the US. Although the college game
thrives, professional football has become boring, says no less an authority
than Sports Illustrated.
The best quarterbacks are ancient, such as Joe Montana, or injured, the
victims of the awful artificial turf. The air has gone out of basketball
with the retirement of Michael Jordan and it has been reduced to recruiting
Gheorge Muresan, a 7ft 7in Romanian with pituitary problems, and Shawn
Bradley, a former Mormon missionary an inch shorter, as if the embarrassing
performances of Manute Bol, a 7 ft 6 in ex-herdsman from Sudan, were not a
warning.
Baseball players are paid too much to play with any enthusiasm and the
talent is too diluted by expansion. Purists were appalled by, though
strangely drawn to, the ineptitude that characterised much of the last World
Series. Ice hockey is so desperate for fans that it is being played near
Disneyland, light years from its frozen northern home, by a team called the
Mighty Ducks.
The only golfer of interest is John Daly and mostly for what he does off the
course. Juvenile tennis stars burn out with monotonous regularity. No wonder
the US is becoming addicted to the virtual reality of video games.
It is tempting to conclude that soccer, coming here in the shape of the
World Cup next year, is pushing on an open door. Millions of children, girls
included, play it because it is cheap and safe. There may be no professional
game played outdoors but college soccer is starting to resemble the real
thing.
There is a young man from New Jersey, Claudio Reyna, the University of
Virginia's midfield player, who is coveted by the wealthy clubs of Italy and
Spain. When the US national side beat England last June it made the front
page of the sports sections with lots of funny headlines. There is already a
black market for tickets for all the World Cup games and about one-fifth of
them are going to appear on national television.
Such temptations should be resisted. Soccer will get a boost from the World
Cup but it must be at least a generation away from establishing itself as a
'major' sport in the US. There are lots of sober reasons for this view,
including lack of money and the problems of adapting a sport with no
artificial break other than half-time to a television system so dependent on
commercial breaks that an American football game of one hour's actual
playing time typically lasts three hours. But these are only half the
problem.
The first is size. Thighs and long hair apart, there is nothing physically
distinguishing about soccer players. They may be marvellous athletes in
their own right, but they look - well, ordinary, and Americans like to
associate themselves with the extraordinary.
Football features 300 lbs linemen capable of running down ball carriers
barely two-thirds the weight. People flock to watch Daly hit a ball further
than any successful golfer has.
The American sports fan might like to think that he, sometimes she, can
emulate their feats. So they buy jumbo drivers and once in a blue moon the
taller ones succeed in slamdunking a basketball into the net in their
driveways or throw perfect spirals in a touch football pick-up game. But it
is all a dream, whereas soccer, played by ordinary looking people, is closer
to gritty reality, from which sports are supposed to provide an escape.
Then there is the statistical problem, which runs far beyond the fact that
there are not enough goals in soccer. Americans prefer sports with high
scores, which is why the 16-14 World Series victory by Toronto over
Philadelphia was so compelling. Americans are consumed by the numbers which
lie behind the final score, as even a glance at any US newspaper's sports
page attests. Assists, tackles, errors, yards, balls, catches, pitches,
averages, blocked shots, turnovers, saves, minutes played and much more
besides are all minutely catalogued.
Soccer can provide only a fraction of this numerical diet, which not only
forms the stuff of every sports talk show and post-game office conversation
but serves as a measurement by which players may reasonably fairly be
compared, even over generations.
All that is left of Bobby Charlton are fond memories and flickering
black-and-white film, but Ty Cobb, who played in the first 20 years of this
century, is still there in baseball's statistical compendium.
Player image also does not seem to work in soccer's favour. There is a
debate among US professional sportsmen over whether or not they should serve
as role models. Charles Barkley, who plays basketball for the Phoenix Suns
with unreserved passion, rejects this imposition and Jordan's well known
gambling flouted it.
But it is a burden mostly accepted by the stars, even to the point of
mind-numbing blandness in, for example, golf (broken only when some of the
Ryder Cup team complained about having to meet Bill Clinton because he had
just increased taxes on their vast incomes). Most sports have severe
sanctions for those who transgress off the field by use of drugs or alcohol.
Soccer, on the other hand, seems stuffed with renegades, roustabouts and
lawbreakers, at least according to the European tabloid press. Maradona,
easily the best known player coming to the US for the World Cup, would
definitely be on a suspended list if he were playing here.
The final problem for soccer is that US sports are never static and always
respond to even the hint of discontent. When pitchers became too dominant in
the 1960s, baseball made it harder for them by lowering the height of the
mound. Football is forever tinkering with its rules to make life safer for
the quarterback and easier for the wide receiver, basketball introduced the
three-point shot and the time clock and ice hockey cracked down on fighting
(a mistake since a good brawl was always as much of an attraction as the
artistry of Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.) Soccer's comparable options seem
more limited.
And there are always great players in the pipeline to revive interest.
Baseball has a clutch of budding stars in their mid-20s, basketball can
replace Jordan with Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and Shawn Kemp, Troy
Aikman-to-Michael Irvine can supplant Montana-to-Jerry Rice who supplanted
Terry Bradshaw-to-Lynn Swann, Eric Lindros supplanted Gretzky and so on.
Here in DC, we will go to RFK stadium to catch, if we can find a scalper,
whoever the World Cup draw gives us and we will expect to be entertained,
even by Saudi Arabia. But - seriously - we will still be more interested to
see if the decline of the once-great 'Skins is reversible or if, 40 miles
down the road, Rafael Palmeiro, the new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) first
baseman, can bring a pennant to the Baltimore Orioles.
After all, to paraphrase a great politician, all sport is local and soccer
merely a world sport.

LURE OF FRISBEES CAPTIVATES A DIVERSE CLIENTELE RANGING FROM CHILDREN TO 
VETERAN CONNOISSEURS OF AN ULTIMATE PASTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Lorenzen considers a Frisbee standard equipment when he takes his family 
on camping trips. Whenever his kids get restless, out come the moon-shaped 
plastic discs. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzen never viewed a Frisbee as anything other than a plastic pacifier, 
however, until his sons, Casey, 9, and Rick, 7, entered the World Junior 
Frisbee Disc contest at Peach Hill Park in Moorpark last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even after Casey and Rick had signed up, it was still hard for Lorenzen to 
take a Frisbee contest seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We started practicing about five minutes before we got here," Lorenzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey and Rick Lorenzen could have used more practice, as both youngsters 
failed to score enough points to advance to the World Junior Frisbee Disc 
regional championships Aug. 5 at Victory Park in Pasadena. The Lorenzen 
brothers needed to score 15 points in three divisions -- accuracy, throwing and 
catching -- to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Maritza Torres, 15, of Moorpark, was all business in the competition and her 
approach paid off. Torres is the first girl in three years of the Moorpark 
tournament to qualify for the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been practicing real hard for this contest with my parents," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 of the top juniors, age 16 and younger, from throughout the 
western United States are expected to compete in the regional championships 
next month in Pasadena. The top finishers will advance to the World Junior 
Frisbee Finals Oct. 18-22 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The world junior champion receives a $1,000 savings bond and the second-place 
finisher wins a $500 savings bond. 
</P>
<P>
For Wham-O, which manufactures Frisbees, the annual contests help to introduce 
the popular plastic toys to a new generation of disc jockeys each year. 
</P>
<P>
For older Frisbee aficionados who never had the chance to compete in organized 
contests, there is another popular use for the toy -- ultimate Frisbee, a sport 
which combines the nonstop action of soccer with the passing and catching of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Frisbee is most popular with former college jocks who never got 
playing with a Frisbee out of their system, according to Ron Rauch, executive 
director of the New York-based Ultimate Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Most ultimate Frisbee players start off by playing other sports -- soccer, 
basketball, football or lacrosse -- and then they come over to this sport," 
Rauch said. 
</P>
<P>
Rauch estimates there are more than 20,000 ultimate Frisbee players nationwide 
who compete on club teams, in summer leagues or in intramural programs. Members 
of the Ultimate Players Assn. cap each season at a national championship 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For the super-serious ultimate Frisbee player there is the World Championships. 
Sixteen countries competed in last year's world championships held in Leuven, 
Belgium, which was won by a team from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In ultimate Frisbee, a seven-man team advances down a 70-yard field by passing. 
A point is scored when a player catches the Frisbee in the end zone. Games can 
last up to four hours depending on the point ceiling that is determined before 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
Rauch estimates that the Frisbee is the main attraction to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"A ball goes up and comes down, there's not a lot you can do with it," Rauch 
said. "You can bank a Frisbee or make it rise over a defender. It's a sport 
which demands an incredible amount of conditioning just to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayden, 31, of Moorpark, has been involved with Wild Fling, a 
Camarillo-based ultimate Frisbee team for the past five years. He was 
introduced to the sport by his wife, Elaine, who competed in ultimate Frisbee 
in college.

"I've always loved team sports like football or basketball," Hayden said. 
"There is a lot of action involved and it is a real fast-moving sport. You can 
do a lot more with a Frisbee than with a conventional football." 
</P>
<P>
While Wham-O makes Frisbees, it cannot take credit for ultimate Frisbee. The 
sport originated in Maplewood, N.J., in 1968 when a group of reporters on the 
newspaper at Columbia High invented a game involving a Frisbee. Ultimate 
Frisbee quickly became popular with college students, which led to the first 
intercollegiate ultimate Frisbee game between Princeton and Rutgers in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ultimate Frisbee is played in 25 countries and it continues to attract 
new converts, according to Rauch.

   Chicago -- This was supposed to be the year that Chicago's
professional sports teams found the keys to their trophy
cabinets, dusted out their insides and filled some of the
long-empty shelves, but now this outcome is a good bit less
than certain.
   First the Black Hawks, who led the regular National Hockey
League season on points, were a first-round KO victim to the
Minnesota North Stars in the playoffs. Then the highly touted
baseball Cubs, who in the off-season spent $30 million to
sign some 1988 All-Stars, lurched out of the starting gate in
familiar fashion, among other things recently blowing a
five-run lead in extra innings. The White Sox are doing fine
to date, thanks, but the date is early.

   So that leaves the basketball Bulls, and here the hopes
remain high. Last Thursday, they got their initial-round
National Basketball Association playoff series against the
New York Knicks off skippingly by winning a track meet,
126-85. In Sunday's second game of the best-of-five test, the
visitors made the going stickier -- about the consistency of
mud -- but the Bulls prevailed here again, 89-79. Call it
versatility.
   "It wasn't a classic, but we controlled the end result,
and that's what's important," said Phil Jackson, the Chicago
coach, about his team's 28-16 fourth-quarter margin, which
proved decisive on Sunday.
   "We showed we can play that style, too," noted star guard
Michael Jordan after cleaning the gunk off his celebrated
sneakers. "Hey, we play Detroit a lot. We're used to it."
   Chances are, the Bulls are going to see more slow stuff if
they continue to progress through the NBA's "second season,"
but off the evidence of their first six months of labor, they
could be up to it. This is a bunch that posted 61 wins during
regular hostilities, the highest total in the league's
Eastern sector and one surpassed by only eight other teams in
pro hoops history.
   In the doing, they got the right to hoist a Central
Division pennant from the dusty rafters of their Chicago
Stadium home. It will have company up there, but not much;
the 25-year-old franchise had previously captured but one
other such honor, and that was 16 years ago, when the league
deemed Chicago to be part of its Midwest Division.
Geographical clarity is not highly valued in the sports
business.
   Back in the wide-tie days, the Dick Motta-coached Bulls
built their victories laboriously, brick by brick, the way
masons raise a wall. The present club, led by the
winged-footed Jordan, prefers to slap 'em out quicker, prefab
style. Forty-three of its 1990-91 triumphs were by 10 points
or more, and 11 were by at least 25. Both were league highs.
   But this is the playoffs, where defense reigns, which is
another way of saying that Dr. Naismith's rule book is
jettisoned in favor of the one written by the Marquess of
Queensberry. If, as John Madden says, one knee equals two
feet in football, then in the NBA playoffs an elbow gets one
a head, and the free throws, if any, be damned. That may as
well have been the Detroit Pistons' motto during a
championship tenure that, so far, has encompassed the past
two campaigns.
   The Pistons' habits are pertinent to a discussion of the
Bulls, because the two teams are not only divisional rivals
but also once and, maybe, future playoff foes. In each of the
past three seasons, the Detroiters stepped on and over the
Chicago swifties en route to their division titles and
championship-round berths, chuckling all the while.
   But the Bulls did a bit better each time -- last year's
Eastern final went the full seven games -- and this season
the injury-weakened Pistons had to crane their necks to see
the Bulls atop the Central, 11 games ahead at the finish. For
public consumption, though, the champs profess not to be
impressed, and, healthier now, vow they'll be waiting for
Chicago when conference-final time comes 'round again. And
while various foes stand between both teams and that
showdown, that's the matchup most expect, and desire.
   The Knicks, the last team to qualify for the playoffs in
the East, are the Bulls' first obstacle. The Gothamites are
strong but slow, but for reasons best known to themselves
chose to run with Chicago on Thursday and were lapped by
halftime. On Sunday, they reverted to their muscle game and
did better -- so much better, in fact, that the game was tied
at 66 with less than eight minutes to play. Patrick Ewing,
their giant center, had scored 24 points, and the Knicks'
aggressive rebounding and tactic of holding the ball on
offense until the 24-second shot clock had all but expired
had thrown the Bulls' attack out of sync.
   But Chicago also was working hard defensively, keeping
hands in enemy faces, and in the end that sank the Knicks.
Worn down by Bill Cartwright, the Bulls' rough-hewn center,
Ewing would not score again, while Jordan finally got his
mates a lead by feeding forward Horace Grant for a layup and
threading the Knick defense for one of his own. The Bulls'
late predominance at the free-throw line (they got to shoot
34 times from there in all, to the Knicks' 16) set the final
margin.
   New York coach John MacLeod mentioned the free-throw
imbalance in his postgame remarks, but, manfully, gave most
of the credit to the Bulls' "D." "We got no easy baskets," he
said of his team's 40.5% field goal average. "It was a
struggle to score every time."
   That's been the idea of the Bulls' entire season, pointed
out Coach Jackson, a Knick in his playing days. "People know
who we are and the kind of game we like to play, but if they
stop us from doing what we prefer -- running -- we can
adjust," said he. "I think that's the major difference
between this team and our last few.
   "At least, I hope it is," he added. "That's what we'll
find out these next few weeks."

DICK VERSACE; 
</P>
<P>
PACERS HAVE A RENAISSANCE MAN AS THEIR LATEST COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He majored in American literature, with an emphasis on Poe and Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in Paris, London, and Frankfurt, West Germany, and once considered 
becoming an expatriate and arguing philosophy and art in sidewalk cafes. 
</P>
<P>
His mother wrote "The Flying Nun." He talks in pictures and of his team's need 
for a "symbiotic relationship" and using "collective force" against an 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
He coached championship teams in basketball and football, the latter at 
Strawn-Wing High in Forrest, Wis., the town that bills itself as "The Egg 
Capital of America, and that's no Yoke." He once screamed on a Chicago street 
corner, "I'm going to coach one day in the NBA!" 
</P>
<P>
Who is this man for all seasons? It's Dick Versace, the head coach of the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Versace inherited a team of classic underachievers with a 6-23 
record that had worn out two coaches -- Jack Ramsay and George Irvine. But 
Versace, who served as an assistant to Chuck Daly in Detroit the last three 
seasons, was considered the perfect man to breathe new life into the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana General Manager Donnie Walsh, who interviewed several candidates, said, 
"They were all very astute and technically knowledgeable, but we need life and 
intensity for this team, and I really believe Versace can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
But even Walsh had to be stunned when Versace, 48, reeled off victories over 
the Los Angeles Clippers and the Pistons at home and beat the Boston Celtics at 
Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, Versace has restored a sense of pride and a commitment to 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to take over a team in the middle of a season and expect 
positive results. A lot of these guys had severely bruised psyches," Versace 
said from his hotel suite near Market Arena in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"What it amounts to is my conducting a training camp on the fly. I'm seeing if 
we can get a little wedding of ideas, a little marriage going between me and 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
Versace has stressed transition defense, unselfishness and a willingness to 
play hard even when the scoreboard says the game is hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
"In Detroit, we called it 'taking it out,' meaning playing down to the final 
buzzer no matter what. You run plays, execute and call timeouts just like it's 
a two-point game. It makes you think like a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"It finally got through to them in a game we were losing in Miami, 116-111. The 
Heat started missing free throws and we tied it with a pair of three-point 
shots and wound up playing two overtimes. With a second left, we got a 
wide-open dunk and blew it, but it convinced the guys nothing is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
With a young roster, Versace, who turned a losing program at Bradley University 
into a team that posted a 156-88 record in his eight seasons, says it is not 
unreasonable to expect the Pacers to enjoy the same upward mobility as the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, who, in less than three years, developed from perennial 
losers into legitimate title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no fool," he said, "but I believe there are a number of talented players 
on this team. We might need a changing of the guards, but in players like Chuck 
Person, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Herb Williams and Wayman Tisdale, there is 
definitely the nucleus for a winning team, given some luck in the draft or 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
As a guideline for the future, Versace cites the traditional National 
Basketball Association powers. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams thatwin consistently," he said, "are the ones that have players 
you're forced to double-team. 
</P>
<P>
"When Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) was younger, the Lakers had three guys in him, 
(James) Worthy and Magic Johnson. Boston had Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and 
Robert Parish. Atlanta has a couple of guys in Dominique Wilkins and Moses 
Malone, and the Pistons had Isiah Thomas and Adrian Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we might have three of those types in Person, Tisdale and Williams. 
They're a solid building block, but it's a matter of accentuating the positive 
and bringing out the best in each of them. But first we have to put away all 
the hidden agendas and selfishness that creeps into every team." 
</P>
<P>
The thrill of victory is what steered Versace into coaching after he had 
considered several other careers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a research scientist in plant pathology," he said, "but I 
was too much of an extrovert to sequester myself in a greenhouse researching 
corn rust." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he accepted the challenge of coaching the Edgewood (Wis.) High 
football team and posted a 7-0 record. He was then asked to help Dave Brown 
coach the school's basketball team, and his life changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown had the most inventive, creative mind I've ever known, way ahead of his 
time," Versace told the Indianapolis News. "The team won 56 games over two 
years, and I was hooked on basketball, winning, the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Versace also has a sense of perspective. "I always looked at coaching as a 
business," he said. "I believe a coaching career is like a businessman's graph. 
It's going to have some highs, lows and even periods. That's the way it's going 
to be and that's the way I'm going to approach it."

<HEADLINE>  MAGIC REVOLUTIONIZED THE GAME
JOHNSON HELPED SAVE THE NBA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The End of the Magic Era  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   There is a select group of players who revolutionized James Naismith's game
of basketball. George Mikan and Wilt Chamberlain brought size. Bob Cousy and
Oscar Robertson brought passing. Bill Russell brought defense. Julius Erving,
Earl Monroe and Pete Maravich brought impossible moves.;   Then there was
Magic.;   Earvin Johnson Jr. brought as much to the game as anyone, if not
more. He was a 6-foot-9 point guard, a fact that never lost its significance
right up until the moment he sadly retired Thursday because he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.;   Magic, so nicknamed because of a 36-point,
18-rebound, 16-assist performance during a high school game, brought more
assists than anyone. He brought championships to every level of competition,
including five to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s. He brought
irrepressible ebullience and charisma to the game. He and Larry Bird -- and
any mention of Magic would not be complete without mention of his longtime
rival -- brought the NBA out of dark days.;   Magical contribution;   "The
only thing you can really say about Magic Johnson is that he revolutionized
the game -- period," said Dallas Mavericks veteran guard Rolando Blackman,
among those shocked by the news. "He came in being able to pass the
basketball, able to defuse every team and bring team camaraderie and
enthusiasm to the game when it was getting dark in those times. It was
tremendous what he did for this game.";   The word "did" seems as
incomprehensible as Magic's no-look passes to Byron Scott or James Worthy.
Johnson may have been descending ever-slightly at 32, but he had won three of
the last four NBA MVP awards before Michael Jordan won the last one. Johnson
still made life miserable for opposing coaches, who tried traps and presses
and rotating defenses but never really figured out how to handle a 6-9 point
guard.;   There was no Next Magic;   Every so often, an NBA scout would take a
look at a college standout and pronounce, "He's the next Magic." But there
never was a Next Magic. Sean Elliott has not turned out to be the Next Magic.
No one has.;   As he was about to begin his pro career in 1979, Johnson was
asked how he had become a guard. He replied:;   "It began in seventh grade,
when I started in the backcourt because we had a lot of tall people but I had
to play somewhere because I was leading the team in scoring. I played forward
in eighth and ninth grades, forward in 10th, center in 11th and all three
positions in my senior year when we (Lansing Evert High School) won the
(Michigan) state championship. I would jump center, play forward if we were
running our man-to-man offense and play guard against zones because I could
pass the ball over the defense.;   "Is it fair to be such a tall guard? It's
fair if you can play the position.";   Unforgettable performance;   Johnson
showed as a rookie that he could play any position, filling in unforgettably
at center for the injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the finals, leading
the Lakers to the title and winning the series MVP award. That versatility was
a key in the Lakers' run during the '80s, but the lasting image is that of
Johnson leading the Showtime fastbreak, faking one way and dishing the other
way for a jam.;   "On the court, he's the magic man, the candy man," former
Lakers Coach Paul Westhead once observed. "He throws the ball behind his back,
waves to the girls, has fun. But he's also a thug, banging into the boards,
knocking people over. Maybe that's why he's Magic. Because now you see him,
now you don't.";   Now you don't.;   He'll miss the Olympics;   There no
longer will be that trepidation by teams entering the Forum. Although trivial
in light of his condition, there will be no Johnson in the 1992 Summer
Olympics. That was going to be his crowning glory; he had done everything else
that mattered -- won, revolutionized a game, saved a league.;   "Before (Bird)
and I came into the league," Johnson said after being named to the Olympic
team, "it was an 'I' league in terms of guys looking to score and not worrying
about passing. Larry and I brought that element to the game. And that brought
the fans back, the excitement back."  </TEXT>

   Two inventors have crafted their own Santa's
workshop in a Fort Worth suburb, breaking into the tough toy
industry while helping others do the same.
   After running into closed doors at several leading toy
companies, Gary Blankenship and Dorian Sandlin formed a merry, if
loose-knit, band of toymakers who are developing their own
products.
   ``We try not to let the everyday drudgery of business,
bookkeeping bring us down on our creativity. The main thing here is
to have fun and create,'' Sandlin said.
   Blankenship, 34, and Sandlin, 39, started talking toys when they
met in church two years ago. Blankenship asked Sandlin, a
commercial artist, to design a package for a stuffed dog he'd
created.
   Sandlin then started pitching toy ideas of his own and last year
they formed Yapco Toy Co., named for that first stuffed dog, Yappie
the Yuppie Pup.
   The pair, who now operate out of a small office in Bedford,
first achieved success with KidsFlex, which hospitals have
purchased to help develop the eye-hand coordination of therapy
patients.
   The toy is a crescent-shaped tube filled with water and a rubber
ball. Grips at both ends of the tube are squeezed to move the ball
from one side to the other.
   The toy is the lead product for Yapco, which is projecting more
than $1.5 million in sales next year. Blankenship and Sandlin said
they are negotiating with a Japanese company to distribute KidsFlex
there.
   To finance more creations, Blankenship and Sandlin started
helping other inventors launch theirs. This year, they created
Toyquest Inc. to provide other toy creators advice and help with
packaging, patenting and making a prototype.
   Toyquest can develop simple toys, like card games, for as little
as $5,000, Sandlin said. More sophisticated toys, such as
electronics items, may take an investment 10 times that size.
Initial inquiries are free.
   ``We found ourselves in a situation where we go to toy companies
with an idea and they'd basically laugh you right out,'' Sandlin
said.
   ``We saw a market out there, friends of ours who had ideas, good
ideas from good people out there. That's what we wanted to tap into
and hopefully make part of the Yapco line. That would help us and
help them, too.''
   Inventors have the option of joining Yapco's toy line, and many
have. Blankenship and Sandlin and more than 30 of their clients
will unveil abot 50 products at the New York Toy Fair, the
industry's showcase event, in February.
   ``It's pretty exciting once you've had an idea and you see it
being exhibited in one of these shows. It's pretty spectacular,''
Blankenship said.
   ``Gary and Dorian really bring a quality agenda with Toyquest,''
said Dale Brandon, a Cleveland-based toy consultant. ``There's
plenty of room for champions to come along in this industry.''
   Brandon, who founded a specialized toy retail chain, is one of
26 people whom Blankenship and Sandlin turned to for advice and
guidance. He believes the toy industry has suffered by squeezing
out creative inventors such as them.
   ``We're still propped up by Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and
sedentary video games,'' Brandon said.
   About 30 percent of the sales by toy giant Mattel Inc. are items
that come from idea submissions outside of the company, said Mattel
spokeswoman Donna Gibbs in Los Angeles.
   Mattel's Magic Nursery doll was an inventor's idea and has
become one of the company's top-selling items this holiday, Ms.
Gibbs said.
   ``There's a stable of inventors that we stay pretty much in
constant contact with,'' Ms. Gibbs said. Those inventors usually
have previous experience in the toy industry, though, she said.
   In addition to Yappie and KidsFlex, Yapco has developed a series
of stuffed cats built around Cruising Charlie, who looks like a
gaudy tourist, several educational products, some board games and a
few gag items.
   Yapco already sells some of the items in specialty stores in
California and Texas.

DAN GOLDIE IS TENNIS' MR. WARMTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Goldie, the former NCAA tennis champ from Stanford and McLean, Va., is a 
guy who could use some help in the public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon, he sniffed, "It's tough to rank the 
victory one-two-three. You'll have to ask my agent. He keeps track of that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Warmth, this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident took place on a team bus in mid-August. At issue was whether or 
not Phil Linz should play his harmonica." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, does that bring back memories. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 25th anniversary of the glorious summer of '64 for the Baltimore 
Orioles and, about now, you're asking yourself, what did the Birds do that 
year? 
</P>
<P>
They led the American League on a merry chase nearly all season, that's all. 
"Pennant Fever," the feeling and the record, was a hot item in Baltimore. Yogi 
Berra was managing the New York Yankees, and they seemed doomed as the players 
had trouble relating with Yogi as boss man. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Robinson of the Orioles was on an MVP kick (.317 with 20 homers and 118 
RBI) and, it appeared, the O's had enough pitching to hold up. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanks had just lost a game on getaway day and, as the bus moved toward the 
airport, Linz hauled out his harmonica. Berra yelped "knock it off" from the 
front of the bus and Linz, preoccupied, didn't hear him. He asked what the 
manager had said. Mickey Mantle answered, "He said, 'Play louder.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Bombers were in turmoil, but they began to play better anyway. In September 
and in need of relief help, they latched on to Pedro Ramos, on his last legs. 
Baltimore manager Hank Bauer groaned that New York would win as it had so many 
times with late-season acquisitions. He was right; the Yanks went 22-6 the last 
month, beating out the Chicago White Sox by a game, the O's by two. But what a 
terrific summer. 
</P>
<P>
A bottle of champagne at Wimbledon goes for $43.20. Which seems a bit steep 
until one considers that strawberries go for 65 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles should post the weights and physical measurements of all hands in a 
prominent place and plead with the lads to maintain their condition. I mean, 
these guys even look as though they can play, unlike so many of their 
pot-bellied brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Heartfelt apologies are due the National Basketball Association. It was assumed 
basketball played the longest season, but this year hockey won by nearly a 
week. The icers went from Oct. 7 to May 28 (234 days) while pro hoops lasted 
229 days. Baseball is third at 203 days, followed by pro football (141), 
college hoops (137) and college football (129). Has indoor soccer sent the boys 
home yet?

Calgary and Vancouver have signed a pair of magnificent Soviet hockey players 
in Sergei Makarov and Igor Larianov, but how good will they be not playing 
alongside each other? 
</P>
<P>
Scene from the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary: The Soviets consistently change 
five men at a time on the fly and, during a game against tough Finland, it was 
time for the first string to skate off. Makarov had the puck and rather than 
just flip it down the other end, he decided to see how far he could go 
single-handedly before being stopped. Going one-on-five, he maneuvered to the 
high slot and got such a fine shot on goal, the netminder had to smother it, 
giving the Soviets a faceoff deep in Finland's territory. Bobby Orr used to do 
such things.

The first recorded cricket game in the United States occurred in 1709 in

Nevertheless, players from across the land congregated in Washington over the

competition. The team is expected to be world class in the not-too-distant 
future due to the influx of people from the West Indies, a cricket hotbed.

   With Game and Culture;
   `I Am . . . Not a Russian'

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Sarunas Marciulionis, the National
Basketball Association's first Soviet import, gazes calmly
into the television lights just after picking up 15 points to
help his team win big in its final home game on Wednesday.
   A man with an accent pokes a microphone toward him and
asks if he has any words for his "many Latino fans." Without
hesitation, he smiles confidently for the cameras and says:
"Sure. Gracias."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Flashback to last fall, when such smoothness was not
evident: Mr. Marciulionis slumps on a chair for medical
treatment after a lousy game, his English thick-tongued
although the sound slipping through his clenched teeth
translates easily enough: "Arrrghh]" He has an ugly gash on
right wrist and a scarlet hook of welts on his left bicep.
Two wires run from a flashing electronic box to his neck,
pulsing with current to relieve muscle spasms. (That injury
resulted from a collision with American culture rather than
with an American opponent: He hurt his neck twisting suddenly
to catch something on one of his three color-TV sets.)
   "You look like a robot," chortles Manute Bol, his
7-foot-7-inch teammate. "Mr. Neck," quips another. "Welcome
to the National Basketball Association, baby," gibes a third.
   The national in this case is a 25-year-old Lithuanian, who
has gone from stardom on the Soviet team to being an average
substitute guard in the NBA. But he has come a long way since
his historic season began last October.
   In one of the more intriguing glasnostic sidelights, Mr.
Marciulionis became the first Soviet athlete ever permitted
by Soviet authorities to play for an American professional
team in a genuine, born-in-the-USA sport. After years of
delicate negotiations and false starts, Mr. Marciulionis
(pronounced Marsh-a-LOAN-us) signed a three-year contract
with the Golden State Warriors at $1.3 million a year. He
gets to keep 60%; Soviet authorities get the rest.
   Mr. Marciulionis's season has been complicated by events
back home, as Lithuania attempts to secede from the Soviet
Union. At his first press conference, the first words out of
his mouth were: "I am a Lithuanian, not a Russian." He is a
nationalist, rooting for independence but worrying about his
family and friends. "Lithuanians must be free," he says.
"Gorbachev must understand this. The wall is down. The Poles
are free. I think Lithuania will be free too, but I worry."
   After the Warriors final game Sunday, Mr. Marciulionis
intends to go back to Lithuania. The Warriors don't want him
to go; they're afraid he might not be able to get back out to
rejoin the team.
   Over the course of the season, Mr. Marciulionis has had
some awful games and some good games (zero points against the
Los Angeles Lakers in March; 33 points against the Orlando
Magic in January), averaging 12 points a game. His coach has
gone from early-season raves about his play to a rather
tepid, "He's done a nice job, but he's got a tremendous
amount to learn."
   All things considered, Mr. Marciulionis says, "it's been a
crazy time."
   Mr. Marciulionis is the leader of a fast break by East
bloc basketball stars toward America, land of the free throw
and home of the wave. It is all part of the
internationalization of professional sports.
   Six Soviet hockey stars have arrived this year to play in
the National Hockey League. One defected in order to play,
which may help explain why the others were given permission
to skate. There is even talk of young Soviet and East bloc
hotshots attending and playing for American colleges, though
some might have to take pay cuts to come here.
   A few deep thinkers perceive serious geopolitical
implications in the sporting world's Westward tilt. The
returns coming in as the NBA season winds down suggest the
main implication for basketball is a potentially vast source
of new talent, amusing spectacle and truly great names.
   Aside from Mr. Marciulionis, there is Zarko Paspalj
(pronounced PAZ-pie), a gabby Yugoslavian on the San Antonio
Spurs who chain-smokes Marlboros, eats at least one Pizza Hut
Supreme a day and says he wants to open the first Pizza Hut
in Yugoslavia. His talking outshines his playing: He is
averaging 2.6 points a game.
   Teammates of Aleksander Volkov, the Atlanta Hawks's
Ukranian power forward, instantly nicknamed him "Gym," short
for "Gym rat," because of his diligent after-hours
practicing. Mr. Volkov (pronounced VOHL-cough) kept asking
why his teammates were calling him "Jim" when Al was just as
easy to pronounce.
   The Los Angeles Lakers drafted Vlade Divac (pronounced
DEE-vash), a 7-footer whose NBA future was briefly clouded by
the subsequent draft by another squad: the Yugoslavian army.
An accommodation was made so Mr. Divac could serve as a
back-up Lakers center rather than a first-string Yugoslavian
grunt, and he has become one of the Lakers's most valuable
substitutes. In all, there are five Eastern European players
in the NBA this year.
   They seem to be catching on to the American game, on
court, off court -- and in court. The owners of Jugoplastika,
a Yugoslavian team sponsored by a plastics conglomerate, sued
the Boston Celtics successfully in federal court to prevent
the Celts from spiriting away Jugoplastika star Dino Radja
(pronounced RAHDjaw).
   The idea of all these dribbling foreigners doesn't please
everyone. "We don't need to go overseas for players," Larry
Bird, the great Boston Celtics star, has asserted. His
comments distressed team officials; the Celtics have the
league's only full-time Eastern European scout, Misho
Ostarckebic (pronounced, oh, never mind). The Celts have also
been pursuing Stojan "Stojko" Vrankovick, a 7-2, 260-pound
Yugoslavian said to have an amazing 37-inch vertical leap.
   Mr. Marciulionis, a 6-5 inch, 200-pound guard with thickly
muscled thighs and huge, powerful hands, was steered into
basketball by the Soviet sport apparatchiks at the age of 10.
At age 18, he made the Soviet team, and quickly became one of
its stars. On the Soviets' 1988 gold medal Olympic team, Mr.
Marciulionis scored 18 points in the defeat of the U.S.
   But since coming to America, Mr. Marciulionis has pretty
much been living in a state of constant confusion --
California. "I have new home, new friends, new climate. I
have much thinking, but not much words . . . trouble
communications with teammates . . . is frustrated but getting
better," he sputters after one recent practice. Though his
English has improved markedly since his arrival, he still
can't speak well enough to understand all the new plays and
new rules that Warriors coaches and American life have thrown
at him.
   This has spawned some revolutionary coaching techniques.
"Two up, two up," barks Warriors assistant coach Garry St.
Jean during a workout, calling for a bread-and-butter
offensive pattern. Mr. Marciulionis holds the ball with a
puzzled look on his face. Mr. St. Jean is explaining what to
do if the center is defended and can't take the pass. "The
center is covered, so you look for the next option," he says.
Mr. Marciulionis flips the ball to the center anyway. "No,
he's covered," Mr. St. Jean explains in a patient, fatherly
way. "Covered."
   Then, suddenly, Mr. St. Jean screams, races from under the
basket, grabs the center's jersey, waves his hand in the
center's face, wraps his arms around the center. Turning to
Mr. Marciulionis, he yells: "Covered." Mr. Marciulionis and
his teammates crack up. They run the play again, and Mr.
Marciulionis gets it right.
   He has adapted quickly in other ways. He lives in a swank
Oakland suburb and owns a black Mercedes. "Is dream come
true," he says. He adds that drivers in California, are "more
gentlemen, more intelligent" than Lithuanian drivers, an
observation that may discourage Americans from car tours of
the Lithuanian countryside.
   At his U.S. basketball debut in the Warriors opening game
in Phoenix, he entered the game at 4:02 of the second
quarter. He started tentatively, passing up an open jumper to
pass off. He stumbled on defense and got called for the NBA's
first Soviet foul. But at 2:01, he took the ball on the right
side, bulled toward the hoop and got fouled. Two free throws.
Swish. Swish. The NBA's first Soviet points.
   The Warriors got clobbered in the game, but Mr.
Marciulionis finished with 17 points. In recognition of his
debut, the NBA has put his jersey from the game on display at
the Basketball Hall of Fame.
   Since the auspicious opener in October, Mr. Marciulionis
has shown powerful moves to the basket and tremendous
competitive fire, but his outside shot, considered one of his
strengths, has been erratic. His defense has at times been
dreadful.
   Mr. Marciulionis vows to do better. "I must come back to
NBA, to prove I belong," he says, standing in front of a
locker. "For myself, for all foreign players. I must improve.
I will improve."

<HL> Sports (A Special Report): Doing It --- Taking It to the Hoop: Pickup Basketball Is a World of Its Own, Where Players Can Feel at Home on Any Court </HL>
<AUTHOR> Rick Wartzman </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   IT'S LUNCH TIME AT the downtown YMCA in Pittsburgh. 
Yet the only thing to eat is a little leather, should you happen to head to the hoop a tad too imperiously. 

   And what can you do about it? 
Nothing, except weave back through the traffic and, as brazenly as before, put the ball up again. 
"In pickup basketball, my theory is there's never a bad shot," explains David White, a 32-year-old local attorney who routinely travels between the courtroom and the court. 
"It's whatever you want to do, whatever you can do." 

   Every day, of course, this sort of free spirit is displayed from coast to coast as thousands of people, attracted to the laissez-faire nature of pickup basketball, fulfill athletic fantasies by shooting buckets. 

   The pickup game itself takes on various forms. 
Three-on-three, half-court, is perhaps most popular because it allows everyone to get involved, and it is easier to get six players together than 10. 
True fanatics, though, are always looking for a full-court, five-on-five matchup. 

   At the Fonde Recreation Center in Houston -- recognized by cognoscenti as the national hot spot for pickup ball -- six half-court games are played simultaneously. 
But for two hours each morning, only full-court action is allowed. 
"If the players act real nice," says Joyce Byrd, manager of the gym, "we'll sometimes extend that." 

   Weaker players at Fonde, in sharp contrast to the scene in Pittsburgh, are pushed onto one court at the south end of the center, away from view. 
"We just don't want them to get hurt," Ms. Byrd says. 
"But even for them, it's all about being competitive." 

   So if you lack the prowess, that's all right. 
Everyone who plays this game is entitled to a few delusions of grandeur (and, if you're short, maybe a delusion of glandular). 
One good shot makes up for several bad ones. 

   Pickup basketball has its own jargon that, like jazz music, is very expressive. 
A ball isn't just a ball; it's a pill or a rock. 
A pass is a dish. 
A blocked shot is a wipe, swat or face job. 
A dunk shot (never an issue for those who don't leap very well) has lots of names, including funk-dunk, punk-dunk, slam, bam, ram, tomahawk and showtime. 

   The parlance of pickup, moreover, contributes to a distinct subculture, able to unite folks who normally wouldn't mix at all. 
"It breaks down a lot of barriers," says Julius Erving, one of the leading scorers, and soarers, in professional basketball history. 
He says his own pickup career is full of fine memories: "I've even played overseas with people who couldn't speak English. 
But they could speak basketball." 

   Nancy Lieberman, the former Olympian, maintains that pickup ball allowed her to enter a world that would have otherwise remained open only to men. 
"I used to take the train up to Harlem by myself," she says. 
"Basketball made me fearless." 

   Sports sociologist Jim Pitts, himself a voracious rebounder at Northwestern University 20 years ago, puts it this way: "You can relate to people easily on the basketball court, something the stratification of the marketplace makes difficult. 
If you're an accountant, you can play with other accountants, but you can also play with the janitor in the building." 

   The Pittsburgh Y offers a cross-section of society. 
Every day about noon, three dozen men -- some age 25, others more than twice that -- gather. 
Among them are corporate managers and lawyers. 
But there are others, too: students, blue-collar types and an occasional drifter. 
Most competed in high school. 
A few took their games to college. 

   These days, some participate in organized leagues as well, but even they prefer the spontaneity of the pickup game and the camaraderie it brings. 
"It's pretty fierce at times, but I feel like I got a lot of friends out here," says a sweat-soaked attorney of 46 years named Jack Cherkin. 
Obsessed like most of those at the Y, he plays four or five days a week. 

   The action is fast, five-on-five. 
The first team to score seven buckets -- a low number so a lot of people get a chance to play -- wins and stays on the floor. 
The losers give way to a new squad. 

   Nobody goes down easily, though. 
Epithets, as well as bodies, have been known to fly in the pursuit of victory. 
"The rules are limited, so it's kind of the honor system," says Paul Mickey, a Y regular who stands 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
He played for Penn State in the mid-1960s. 

   Actually, this court isn't nearly as rough-and-tumble as some. 
Lots of the guys here attempt long-range jump shots, or "the J," whereas in more downtrodden parts of the inner city, respect is earned solely by sinking an inside basket through a thicket of arms and torsos. 

   Court etiquette varies from gym to gym, from city to city and, especially, from state to state. 
Consider, for instance, Indiana, just about the only place in the country where people don't play a version of half-court basketball called "make it, take it." 

   Under those rules, the team that scores will immediately get the ball on offense again. 
But in Hoosier Land, the purity of the contest is held in such high regard that the team that scores will turn around and play defense. 

   "It's a very Calvinist work ethic in Indiana," says Alexander Wolff, co-author of "The Back-In-Your-Face Guide to Pick-Up Basketball." 
California, he adds, is the lone spot where players observe the three-seconds rule, which limits the amount of time you can camp out under the basket. 
Mr. Wolff surmises: "People live on the fault-line out there, and maybe they're used to being protective of their real estate." 

   Still, no matter where the rim hangs -- on the side of the country barn or in the middle of the city park -- enough universal rules exist to make a player feel at home anywhere. 
For example, pickup ball everywhere is marked by its frenetic pace. 

   And today is no exception. 
A player drives toward the basket, pulls up for the shot, maneuvers around the defender and waits for the sibilant sound: whoosh. 
Never mind that these guys are mostly has-beens, and a few might even be described as never-weres. 

   This game is about dreaming. 
And for someone to head back to the office, knowing he threw in a hanging, double-pump jumper, is enough to make him feel like king of the court.

   If Santa treated his elves the way retailers have been
handling their suppliers this Christmas, he would likely face
a major revolt.
   Haunted by the huge markdowns of Christmases past,
department and specialty stores are keeping tight control of
inventories and forcing suppliers to swallow more risks and
costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Retailers are delaying some orders, canceling or refusing
others at the last minute and demanding more rapid delivery
on those orders they do place. This forces manufacturers to
swell their own inventories, speed up production cycles and
stick to traditional products -- or risk losing business.
   "Retailers are eager to err on the side of scarcity this
time, and it clearly is hurting manufacturers, particularly
at a time when sales are dropping off," says Kurt Barnard, a
retail-industry consultant and president of Retail Marketing
Report.
   Children's Palace/Child World Inc. toy stores, for
example, told suppliers last June that it would stretch some
Christmas ordering from August to December and also asked
vendors to hold merchandise without any promise of an order.
Harwood Cos., a boys' and men's clothing maker, says one
customer threatened to fine it up to $100 for a mislabeled $7
garment.
   Few can blame retailers for such tactics: Their cash flows
improve, they save interest and storage costs and also avoid
big markdowns in January. In September, U.S. retailers'
inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.57, according to the Commerce
Department, down from 1.60 for September 1989 and 1.59 in
September 1990.
   But the retailers' cost cutting often simply means higher
expenses for suppliers. They must stockpile inventory so they
can fill orders suddenly, adding to their interest costs.
"Retailers know that if they need merchandise, they can
likely order it for immediate delivery," says Deborah
Bronston, who follows the apparel industry for Prudential
Securities.
   Harwood's chief executive Michael Rothbaum calls some of
this behavior "predatory." He says customers now place orders
but don't confirm them until shortly before shipment, giving
them room to wiggle out of the deal. Even though Harwood has
cut its manufacturing process to hours from weeks, the
company still finds itself badgering retailers to confirm
orders and then scrambling to fill them quickly. "Retailers
want to be able to say that it wasn't an order in the first
place if {the item} doesn't take off" in the stores, says Mr.
Rothbaum.
   Worse, he adds, is the proliferation of "charge-back"
policies that allow retailers to pay the manufacturer less or
return goods for relatively minor problems, such as placing
the packing slip on the wrong part of the box. "I could ship
$50,000 worth of merchandise and wind up owing $50,000," Mr.
Rothbaum says.
   Manufacturers have little leverage in resisting retailers;
and small manufacturers in particular don't dare put up a
fight, because retailers have been steadfastly pruning their
supplier lists. "It takes a level of predictability out of
the business," says Prudential Securities' Ms. Bronston. "But
that's the new modus operandi; and if they can't {adapt},
they'll get less business."
   While antagonism between retailer and vendor is nothing
new, tough times in retailing and the sluggish economy have
exacerbated the situation. In clothing -- which has the most
inventory risk because of fickle tastes and rapidly changing
fashions -- the number of "at-once" orders has accelerated in
recent months. That partially explains the doubling in
apparel makers' inventories from last year. "The problems
become more acute at Christmas," when activity peaks, says
Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for Price Waterhouse's
Management Horizons unit.
   Even for the manufacturers, some of the new pressure is
good medicine. It forces them to reduce their own costs by
speeding production cycles and honing their just-in-time
inventory techniques. The faster response time also helps
American-made goods beat imports, which can't be delivered as
promptly without stockpiling.
   The pressure has also fostered new partnerships between
retailer and manufacturer to reduce overall costs. Levi
Strauss &amp; Co. now offers a "LeviLink" computer system that
automatically replenishes retailers' inventories based on
Levi's market studies, without receiving an order. The
company has also adopted a "quick response" arrangement with
its own suppliers that has cut its production time for a
typical pair of jeans to 22 days from 44.
   Like many manufacturers, Wooster, Ohio's Rubbermaid Inc.
keeps track of its retail customers' inventories with a
computer hookup to the retailer's point-of-sale data. This,
says Rubbermaid President Wolf Schmidt, "avoids dead periods"
between customer orders and shipments. "There's no question
{retailers are} more aggressive in lowering their inventory,"
Mr. Schmidt says, "but we're trying to more closely manage
our own inventory. If you stand around and yell `victim,'
sure enough you'll be a victim."
   Makers of basic goods such as jeans, T-shirts and
sweatshirts have benefited from retailers' reluctance to
gamble on new products this season. Huffy Corp., which makes
low-cost bicycles, basketball backboards and other goods that
don't go out of fashion quickly, says its customers have been
ordering more this year in hopes of a strong Christmas.
   Retailers' caution has restrained manufacturers'
product-development efforts. "Retailers are going with
conservative designs: tried-and-true products with good
margins," says a spokesman for Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., the maker
of Ray-Ban sunglasses.
   Even manufacturers who say their products are selling well
have felt the pressure. "We have to overproduce," says a
spokesman for Corning Inc.'s consumer-products unit, which
makes dishware and cooking equipment. "The burden falls back
to the manufacturer." Earlier in the Christmas season,
Corning feared that even if its products sold out, retailers
might not reorder because they preferred to exhaust
inventories of other products; now Corning says the retailers
reordered anyway.
   Retailers sometimes hurt themselves by delaying orders.
Children's Palace/Child World says suppliers couldn't fill
late orders on some popular items that sold out. But the
toy-store chain, which has cut inventories by 30% from last
year's levels, says it is staying the course.
   To underscore the chain's determination, Children's Palace
and Child World stores are cutting display shelf heights to
five feet from up to 12-thus having fully stocked shelves but
carrying less inventory than before. Even for hot-selling
items, such as Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, the stores
require shipments every week or two, instead of just ordering
a pile of 50,000 in September.
   "Last year retailers bought a lot of stuff in August and
September and hoped it sold -- and if it didn't they dealt
with it in January," says the toy company's chairman, W. John
Devine. "We think there's a better way."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Bumping Hips and Heads in Box Lacrosse
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Philadelphia -- The Indians of the American Northeast
invented the sport of lacrosse more than 500 years ago. They
called it "baggataway," which meant "bumping hips." The game
has undergone many changes since, not all of them in the
direction of greater refinement.
   On Sunday, for example, the Detroit Turbos of the Major
Indoor Lacrosse League journeyed to the City of Brotherly
Love to play the hometown Wings, and their contest was marked
by several fights, all of which involved the bumping of more
than hips.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A guy jumps you, you gotta defend yourself," said husky
Paul Gait, the Detroit rookie star, who bumped his fist
against the face of the Wings' equally husky John Tucker in
the third quarter of the 14-12 Turbo win, and had his face
bumped by Tucker's fist in return. "That's the kind of game
this is," Gait added, unneccessarily. "You can't show your
skills if you're intimidated."
   Gait et al. had just showed their skills to a near-full
house of 16,622 in the Spectrum on this sunny Sunday,
indicating either that lacrosse is catching on or that folks
hereabouts lack other entertainments. Its promoters weren't
fussy about which. "This is great]" enthused Chris Fritz, the
league's president. "It shows we're on track to make lacrosse
America's No. 5 sport." Right behind baseball, football,
basketball and luge, I guess.
   In case you've never seen lacrosse, I'll explain it to
you. The outdoor game is played on a large, grassy field with
lots of players, most of them from Baltimore. The indoor
version, the one the MILL plays, is Canadian in origin,
invented to give hockey rinks some utility during that
nation's brief summer. Its name there is "box lacrosse,"
suggesting a link with the pugilistic sport.
   Artificial turf covers the ice and there are six players
to a side, including a goalie. All the others are called
forwards, perhaps so as to not confuse them about the
direction of the opposition's goal.
   Each player carries a stick with a netted loop on its end.
The stick is used to catch, throw and shoot the ball (it must
be shot rather quickly; there's a 40-second clock) and to
whack other players. Hitting a ball carrier is permissible so
long as the blow does not land on his head or below the
knees. Nonetheless, players distrust each other's aim and
wear stout helmets with full-cage face masks.
   The MILL now is in its fifth campaign, and has teams in
New York, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Worcester, Mass., in
addition to Motown and Philly. Each plays a 10-game,
weekends-only schedule ending March 23, followed by a
championship game matching the winners of the league's two
divisions. There are only three of those, so no one finishes
worse than third.
   The league owns all the teams, and turned a profit last
season, thank you. This is partly because it holds players'
base salaries to a modest $125 to $300 a game. Even with
season-ending performance bonuses, that comes to less
annually than Roger Clemens loses behind his sofa cushions.
   The MILL also thrives because it has confined itself
largely to the Northeast, where a lacrosse-fan base exists.
Leaguewide attendance has been good, averaging 11,000 a game
last season, and about the same so far this one. According to
MILL demographic research, it's a well-heeled crowd, the
average fan being a 30-year-old bond trader who drives a BMW,
reads Playboy, has 2.6 girlfriends, carries an immense load
of credit-card debt and enjoys watching people beat one
another with sticks.
   Many of the players also fit the yuppie mold, thanks to
their Eastern-collegiate backgrounds and day jobs. Some are
lawyers, bankers, stockbrokers or real-estate developers.
Others have respectable jobs.
   The two fellas that may make the thing go, though, still
are undergraduates at Syracuse University. They are the
twin-brothers Gait, Paul and Gary. The 23-year-old natives of
Victoria, B.C., were All-Americans on Syracuse teams that won
several NCAA titles. Their college eligibility expired before
they got their degrees, and they have stayed on to get same
while performing with the pros.
   The Gaits are the Michael Jordans of lacrosse, noted for
their stick-handling and acrobatic skills. Among the moves
they have pioneered is the "Air Gait," in which they leap out
from behind the hockey-like goal and fling in the ball as
they fly past, without violating the "crease" area, into
which only the goalie may tread.
   They're so good that their addition has lifted the Detroit
team from the league's worst last season, with a 1-7 won-lost
record, to first place currently, at 5-1. Paul's two goals
Sunday set his season total at 30, breaking the league's
single-season record with four games yet to play. Gary had
three assists to break that mark, plus three goals.
   "You wonder how good we'd be if we could practice together
more," mused Medo Martinello, the Turbos' coach. He explained
that the Gait boys rarely make it to Detroit for workouts,
and that the occupational obligations of team members who
live locally also interfere. "Even I can't make it
sometimes," noted Martinello, who owns a couple of pizzerias
in Windsor, Ont.
   But if rehearsal was lacking, Sunday's production came off
well. Besides the pushing, shoving and hacking, the players
handled the ball with considerable flair; most notable were
Turbo breakaways begun by long passes from goalie Ted Sawicki
that would have done Dan Marino proud. Detroit jumped to a
3-0 lead and saw the Wings rally to an 11-10 edge before
breaking the game with four consecutive last-period goals.
   And afterward, icing their bruises, the players spoke not
of their meager salaries but of how good it was to be able to
continue their sport at all. "If it weren't for the league,
most of us would be playing for nothing," said Turbo forward
Jacques Monte, a coach at the College of Wooster in Ohio. "Of
course," he added, "that's just about what we're doing now."

   BUCHAREST -- As a new Major League Baseball season opens
with millionaire outfielders whining about their measly
wages, spare a cheer for a league so impoverished that the
batters have to wear their own motorcycle helmets to the
plate.
   "We would have liked to start our season in April or May,
but we don't have enough equipment yet. So maybe we will
start in June," says Cristian Costescu, the president of the
Romanian Baseball Federation. "Some teams have only one bat.
We need more balls. But our biggest disaster is gloves. Some
teams don't have a full set. It is very difficult to practice
when you have to share gloves."

   As spring comes to the Balkans, Romania is taking its
first swing at America's national pastime. The league
president is a former national champion swordsman who has
never played an inning of baseball. Enough coaches have
signed up to form 29 teams around the country, but there are
only six proper fields. The amateur players are veterans of
"oina," the beloved sport of Transylvania that is played on a
rectangle instead of a diamond and bears as much resemblance
to baseball as Babe Ruth does to Dracula.
   But never mind all that. "What the Romanians lack in
equipment and expertise, they make up for in desire to play,"
says Allen Docal, the American Information Center director in
Bucharest and unofficial talent scout. "They know they aren't
Reggie Jackson and the New York Yankees."
   They aren't even the Chicago Cubs. But at least it is a
start, which, given baseball's history here, is quite an
achievement.
   "We are orphans in Romania, too," says Mr. Costescu,
comparing his fledgling league to the thousands of babies
abandoned during the Communists' reign, when both birth
control and baseball were officially banned. "As we start
with our baseball activity, you can put a big 0 on our
scoreboard."
   Pitching the shutout was that renowned spoilsport, Nicolae
Ceausescu, the Communist dictator who feared that if baseball
came to Romania, capitalism would be sure to follow. For
various other reasons, he also banned Scrabble, bridge,
martial arts and field hockey.
   Mr. Costescu, a stocky man with silver hair, lives, eats
and drinks baseball in a little office at the end of a dark
corridor on the seventh floor of the gloomy Ministry of
Sports building, where the elevator rarely works. A miniature
cardboard cutout of former New York Mets Manager Davey
Johnson looks on from the bookshelf. A wooden ball sits on
the desk, like a paperweight. On the wall behind hangs a
banner from Topps, the American baseball-card maker. "Team
U.S.A. today, big leagues tomorrow," it says.
   Even though it is only 8 in the morning, Mr. Costescu
offers an American visitor a glass of plum schnapps. "A
Romanian tradition," he explains. He proposes a toast to
baseball and settles into his chair.
   "I saw my first game in 1985. It was in Italy," he says,
beginning the saga of baseball in Romania. Mr. Costescu, then
the head of the oina federation, returned home with tales of
what he had witnessed, a baseball instructional video and a
rule book, all of which he shared with a couple of physical
education teachers. For the next two years, this group
covered the rudiments of the game, translating the rules into
Romanian, scouting potential fields and publishing some
articles in the local sports newspapers to whip up interest.
A few trial games were even played under the nose of the
security police, who figured it was a mutant strain of oina.
   In 1988, Mr. Costescu committed an error. He boldly
approached Romania's sports officials with an application to
set up a baseball federation, which would have made the sport
eligible for government funding. He didn't get to first base.
   "They told me, `No, baseball is a capitalist sport and we
will never allow such propaganda for capitalism in Romania,'
" recalls Mr. Costescu. "You see, the government knew
baseball is a sport very much loved by American people. It
isn't a Soviet sport, but an American sport. And America is
the No. 1 capitalist country."
   The baseball advocates argued that the game is also the
national sport of Cuba. They also pointed out that Romanians
play volleyball and basketball, two other American sports. To
no avail. "After that, we had to go underground," Mr.
Costescu says with a conspiratorial grin. Clandestinely, he
and the others continued to plan for the day when baseball
would be free. They drew up a mock schedule based on a
fantasy league. It was the longest off-season in history.
   Then, during Christmas of 1989, a popular revolution
overthrew the Communists and Mr. Ceausescu was executed. On
Feb. 4, 1990, the Romanian Baseball Federation was born.
   Soon, Mr. Costescu, with the sponsorship of the U.S.
Information Agency, was off to Williamsport, Pa., home of
Little League Baseball, to watch and learn. Next stop was
Tennessee to visit the U.S. Olympic baseball training
operation. Then it was on to Italy with 13 other Romanians
for a two-week coaching clinic. Back in Romania, practice
started for the first season. But the troubles weren't over.
   "You know the economic situation in Romania," Mr. Costescu
moans. "There isn't enough money for all the sports, so the
authorities give aid only to federations with good results.
They told us to find some sponsors, but the sponsors are only
interested in championship teams. It is a vicious circle.
Without sponsors there is no possibility to develop. Without
development, there are no sponsors." He has the desperate
sound of a man caught in an eternal rundown.
   Enter the Americans. Mr. Docal, who has been named
honorary president of the baseball federation, found some
equipment in the attic of the embassy. The International
Baseball Association, based in the U.S., sent some bats and
balls. Mr. Costescu wrote letters to American
sports-equipment companies. One replied. It sent umpiring
gear.
   Still woefully short of the basics, Mr. Costescu is now
turning to the free market, just as the old dictator feared.
He has taken a bat to a Romanian wood carver and some gloves
to a Romanian shoemaker and has asked them to see what they
can do. He would like to work out a joint venture with an
American partner to make sports equipment in Romania.
   Why not just use oina equipment, he is asked. Mr. Costescu
pours another glass of schnapps and proceeds to diagram an
oina game. "It is difficult to explain to a foreigner," he
cautions.
   The oina bat is thin and equally proportioned, like a
stickball bat. The ball is soft, stuffed with horse hair. No
one uses gloves. There are two teams of nine players, one at
bat, one lined up in three rows on a rectangular field. The
batter hits the ball, pitched by a member of his own team,
and proceeds to run between the rows of fielders. The
fielders try to hit the runner by throwing the ball at him.
If they do, they get two points. If they don't, the batter
gets two points. When all the batters are out, the teams
switch sides. They play one inning. Then the game is over.
   Mr. Costescu opens a filing cabinet and retrieves a stack
of papers that tell a curious story. It seems some military
officers from Transylvania emigrated to the U.S. about 150
years ago. There, they put on an oina exhibition. Perhaps one
of the onlookers, so goes the Romanian tale, was Abner
Doubleday, a U.S. Army officer who is traditionally credited
with inventing baseball.
   "Maybe oina had some influence on baseball. Who knows?"
says Mr. Costescu. "We say oina is the Romanian national
sport, but we don't know who invented it. Some say it was
invented in the Turkish empire."
   Still, baseball has something oina doesn't. "From the
beginning I loved baseball because it has a moral quality,"
says Mr. Costescu. "Fair play is the fiber of baseball. It is
a game that can teach you many things."
   He gets misty-eyed as he talks about his favorite element
of baseball. "The sacrifice bunt," he proudly announces. "One
player sacrificing himself to help another. I think it is a
very nice play."

<HEAD>Entrepreneur's Idea For Gym Gear Odor-Cutter Brings Quick Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The stinky inspiration for Sneaker Balls came to
entrepreneur Dennis Green two years ago after his wife complained
about an aroma in his car.
   ``She said she borrowed my car and it sure smelled bad. She said
it was the gym bag in the back seat,'' said Green, an athletic
45-year-old who plays basketball regularly.
   ``It just hit me all of a sudden _ there's a product there. Not
something to freshen the car, but to freshen the bag so it wouldn't
smell the car up,'' he said.
   That brainstorm spawned Sneaker Balls _ fragrance discs encased
in colorful pingpong-size balls made of recycled plastic soft drink
bottles. Green's invention is designed to cut the odor of moldy gym
bags, rancid tennis shoes and sweaty lockers for up to three months.
   Each Sneaker Ball exudes a fragrance and an odor-blocker, which
floods the olfactory receptors of the brain so they cannot smell
sweat, Green says. The chemicals are released by twisting the balls
to open slots cut into the sides.
   According to their motto, Sneaker Balls have ``The Courage To Go
Where The Ugly Stuff Grows.''
   It sounds like a funny idea, but since Sneaker Balls hit the
market in July 1988, Green's company, Dennis Green Design Group
Ltd, has sold 1.5 million at $2.50 to $4 apiece. A new Sneaker Ball
design will debut later this year, and the back orders already
total 5 million.
   Green's business comes from most of the big U.S. discount store
chains and athletic footwear retailers and from stores in Canada,
Mexico, Europe and Asia.
   But Green isn't in the factory all day, supervising production _
he's at home, writing fiction.
   ``I have one philosophy in business, and that is that I want to
write books, and if I have employees I can't very well do that,''
he said.
   For that reason, Green has subcontracted the entire Sneaker
Balls manufacturing and distribution operation to a Loveland, Colo.
company called New Systems Molding.
   About 50 employees at the New Systems plant work
around-the-clock, molding Sneaker Balls and assembling them. Green
expects the work force to double within six months.
   Green is a trained architect who grew bored with his profession
and began designing and selling his own line of greeting cards.
Within five years, Green and his wife were designing and selling
greeting cards across the United States and in 24 other countries.
   In 1981, they sold the business so Green could write, but the
new owners went bankrupt three years later, Green's income stopped
and he went back to designing and selling cards _ until his wife's
complaint gave him the idea for Sneaker Balls.
   Green said it took a year to make a prototype of Sneaker Balls
that he could display to potential investors.
   ``I began doing research. I didn't know anything about
fragrances or plastics either,'' he said. ``I made the prototype by
stuffing fragrance in cotton balls because I didn't know anything
about fragrance discs. I put them in my bag when I worked out. I
put them in my shoes when I wasn't working out.''
   In a locker room one day, someone noticed Green's Sneaker Balls
and asked him about them. The man, who was a broker, signed an
option agreement with Green that led to a contract with an investor
group.
   But that was a false start _ the investors made the first
payment, but not the next two. Green took Sneaker Balls to a trade
show and immediately found a distributor who got him a contract
with K mart Corp.
   Four months later, in July 1988, he began shipping Sneaker Balls
to customers.
   Now Green spends his mornings writing fiction, and his
afternoons attending to business and playing basketball, a
carryover from his days at Boise State College in Idaho, where he
was a starting forward.
   And, as business booms, he's also finished his first novel:
``Double Bind,'' a psychological thriller about a Washington
journalist.
