   MONTREAL -- Severe production cuts in March didn't make a
dent in Canadian pulp producers' big inventories. Meanwhile,
Canadian newsprint makers were able to trim their inventories
slightly as shipments picked up.
   Canadian output of market pulp fell 10% in March to
553,000 metric tons from 615,000 metric tons a year ago, the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said. However, pulp
shipments fell 13% to 564,000 metric tons from 652,000 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big drop in shipments left producers' pulp inventories
at the end of March virtually unchanged from February at
532,000 metric tons, a 30-day supply. Inventories at the end
of March 1989 were 290,000 metric tons, a 14-day supply. Pulp
producers operated at 85% of capacity in March, compared with
97% a year ago.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp
and of newsprint.
   Shipments from Canadian newsprint mills rose 2.7% in March
to 825,000 metric tons from 803,000 metric tons a year ago.
Newsprint demand has picked up as some publishers build up
stocks of newsprint in anticipation of a possible strike this
year at paper mills in eastern Canada.
   Canadian newsprint production in March was steady at
794,000 metric tons, compared with 796,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Canadian newsprint mills operated at 95% of capacity
in March, unchanged from the previous year.
   Canadian newsprint mills' inventories at the end of March
were 401,000 metric tons, down from 413,000 metric tons a
year ago and 432,000 metric tons in February.
   U.S. consumption of newsprint in March was flat at
1,044,000 metric tons, compared with 1,047,000 metric tons a
year earlier.

   Canadian production of market pulp in March rose 3.6% from a year earlier as output exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 638,000 metric tons of market pulp in March, compared with 616,000 in March 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and other items. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said the industry produced at 102% of its capacity in March, compared with 98% a month earlier and 99% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is strong, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, thereby increasing market-pulp output beyond official capacity levels. 

   In the first three months of this year, output was up 1.9% to 1,844,000 metric tons from 1,809,000 a year earlier. 

   Shipments in March declined 6.5% to 673,000 metric tons from 720,000, reflecting reduced exports to Western Europe and other overseas markets except Japan. 
Exports to the U.S. were up 5%. 

   Canadian producer inventories fell 10% to 313,000 metric tons at the end of March, representing a 15-day supply, from 348,000 at the end of February, or a 17-day supply. 
The March inventory figure was up 2% from 307,000 metric tons at the end of March 1987, which also represented a 15-day supply.

   Canadian production of market pulp declined 6.8% last month from a year ago as the industry operated at 92% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 561,000 metric tons of market pulp in April, compared with 602,000 metric tons in April 1987.

Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   An association official said the drop in output is likely due to temporary production halts for maintenance that coincided with Easter and a strike at Domtar Inc.'s pulp mill at Lebel-sur-Quevillon, Quebec. 

   Last month's 92% operating rate compared with a rate at 102% of capacity in March and 100% a year ago. 

   For the first four months of this year, output was off slightly at 2,409,000 metric tons from 2,411,000 metric tons for the first four months of 1987. 

   Total April shipments were unchanged at 549,000 metric tons. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of April rose 3.8% to 325,000 metric tons, representing a 16-day supply, from 313,000 metric tons at the end of March, representing a 15-day supply.

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 614,000 metric tons of market pulp in June, compared with 562,000 tons in June 1986. 
In the first six months of this year, market pulp production was up 11% from 1986 levels. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said that the industry produced at 103% of its rated capacity in June, compared with 92% in May and 96% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is good, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, according to association officials. 

   Shipments in June increased 16% to 698,000 metric tons from 603,000 tons with exports to Western Europe rising 29% and shipments to the U.S. up 8%. 

   Canadian producer inventories were 299,000 metric tons at the end of June, representing a 15-day supply, off 22% from 383,000 tons at the end of May, or a 19-day supply, and off 17% from 359,000 tons at the end of June 1986, also a 19-day supply.

   Canadian producers of market pulp resumed their high production rate in October after a temporary drop in September, when many mills suspended output temporarily for routine maintenance. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 601,000 metric tons of market pulp last month, off 1% from 607,000 metric tons a year earlier but 16% ahead of the 517,000 metric tons produced in September. 

   And after running at full capacity for most of this year, the operating rate fell to 86% in September. 
An industry official blamed the decline in the operating rate to the decision by several producers to halt production temporarily at Labor Day for maintenance that had been delayed earlier in the year.

   North American Newsprint Producers
   Push Through a Price Increase of 5%

   Most North American newsprint producers pushed through a
scheduled price increase of slightly more than 5% Friday, the
first good news in two years for struggling newsprint makers.
But if labor negotiations in Eastern Canada are settled
without a strike, prices could slide back to pre-increase
levels, some industry executives and observers said.
   "It looks like {the increase} has a better chance of
sticking than it did two months ago," said Homer Taylor, vice
president, supply, at Knight-Ridder Inc. Mason Sizemore,
president of the Seattle Times, said five of his six
newsprint suppliers raised their prices, and, "As far as I
know, it's going through."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Led by Toronto-based Abitibi-Price Inc., which said it
expects the price boost to hold, most North American
producers earlier this year announced the increase for June
1. Producers raised the benchmark Eastern U.S. list price of
standard newsprint 5.4%, or US$35 a metric ton, to $685 a
metric ton. A similar increase was announced in other
markets, where the pricing system is slightly different. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   Newsprint now is sold at about a 19% discount from list,
so the price increase raises transaction prices, or actual
selling prices, to about $555 a metric ton from about $525 in
the East.
   When the price increase was first announced, many
newsprint buyers said it had little chance of going into
effect. But the supply of newsprint has tightened in the past
several weeks, newsprint buyers said, as publishers built
inventory in anticipation of a possible strike at mills in
Eastern Canada. U.S. publishers buy more than half of their
newsprint from Canadian mills.
   Any strike would first hit Montreal-based Stone
Consolidated Inc., a unit of Stone Container Corp., Chicago.
The Canadian Paperworkers Union targeted certain Stone
Consolidated mills for negotiation of contracts that will
then set the pattern for settlements at other Eastern
Canadian mills. A Stone Consolidated spokeswoman said that
negotiations on contract language began last Thursday, and
that once those points are settled, discussion of salary
issues will start. The union is seeking wage increases of 8%
a year in each of two years.
   Canadian newsprint producers in particular are desperate
for a price increase. "The average Canadian company isn't
making money" at current prices, said Brian Topp, an analyst
at Capital Group Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Along with
facing higher labor costs, Canadian producers continue to be
hurt by the high level of the Canadian dollar, valued against
the U.S. dollar.
   Analysts said that, without a strike, producers will have
to curtail production to make the price increase stick. While
U.S. output has increased this year, Canadian mills have
already cut some production. Canadian newsprint output in the
first four months of this year dropped 2.6% from a year
earlier, according to the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association, an industry group. Canadian mills operated at
94% of capacity through the end of April, compared with 97% a
year earlier.
   Meanwhile, Canadian producers of market pulp continue to
make sharp cuts in production to keep prices for their major
premium grade pulp from falling. Canadian producers of market
pulp operated at just 77% of capacity in April, as production
fell 11% from a year earlier. For the first four months,
Canadian market pulp production fell 8% and shipments
declined 13%.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of newsprint and
of market pulp.

   Canadian production of market pulp fell in September to the lowest monthly level in a year, as many mills suspended output for routine maintenance. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said production was 516,000 metric tons in September, 10% higher than the 468,000 produced in September 1986 but 19% below the 634,000 produced in August. 
A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. 

   The mills' operating rate fell to 86% in September after being near 100% for most of the first eight months of the year. 
An industry official cited a decision by several producers to suspend production around Labor Day for maintenance that had been postponed earlier in the year.

   Shipments in September rose 17% to 611,000 tons from 521,000 a year earlier, reflecting increased shipments to major markets such as the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. 

   The higher shipments and lower production resulted in a 23% drop in producer inventories to 323,000 tons at the end of September, or a 16-day supply, from 418,000 tons at the end of August, or a 20-day supply. 
The September inventory figure was down 7.1% from a year earlier.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. said
it will close its biggest pulp mill for two weeks beginning
June 25, because of soft market conditions.
   The temporary closure of the Harmac pulp mill, near
Nanaimo, British Columbia, will reduce MacMillan Bloedel's
inventory of bleached pulp by about 16,000 metric tons, it
said. The move follows an extended maintenance closedown at
Harmac in March, which curtailed the mill's output by about
15,000 metric tons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, Harmac produced 370,000 metric tons of market
pulp, accounting for about 75% of MacMillan Bloedel's total
market pulp output. Market pulp is wood pulp that is sold on
the open market, to producers of paper and other products.
   A metric ton equals about 2,204.62 pounds.
   MacMillan Bloedel, 49.9%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda
Forest Inc., said the closure will affect 800 workers at the
mill and about 100 workers at the company's Thunderbird
sawmill, which is scheduled to close for maintenance during
the same period.
   Canadian shipments of market pulp fell 13% in March,
compared with March, 1989. The big drop in shipments left
producers with 532,000 metric tons of inventory, a 30day
supply. That compared with year-earlier inventory of just
290,000 metric tons, or a 14-day supply.

   Canada's newsprint mills continued to operate at near-capacity levels in November as newsprint output rose 4.6% from a year earlier. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, reported that Canadian mills operated at 97% of capacity for the second consecutive month. 
That compares with 93% of capacity in November 1985. 

   Production in November was 782,000 metric tons, compared with 747,000 in November 1985, but total shipments declined 2.2% to 743,000 metric tons from 760,000. 

   Exports to the U.S., Canada's biggest newsprint customer, were off 7.8% to 529,000 metric tons in November from 574,000 in the like month in 1985. 
However, domestic shipments rose 12% and exports to other markets were up 19%. 

   Production in the first 11 months of 1986 was up 2.6% from the similar period in 1985, while shipments were 3.3% ahead, the association reported. 

   U.S. consumer newsprint inventories were 1,263,000 metric tons at the end of November, representing a 39-day supply, off 9.4% from a revised total of 1,394,000 metric tons at the end of October, which also represented a 39-day supply. 
The end-of-November inventories were also off 13% from 1,448,000 metric tons at the end of November 1985, when stocks represented a 46-day supply. 

   Newsprint supplies are affected by seasonal factors.

<TEXT>
   Canada's pulp and paper industry expects output to reach record levels in 1987, and its mills to operate at the highest capacity in almost a decade. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said in its annual forecast that total shipments of pulp and paper are expected to rise 5% this year to 24.3 million metric tons from last year's 23.2 million, which was a 7% increase from 1985. 
The group expects the industry to operate at 98% capacity this year, compared with 94% last year and 90% in 1985. 

   Analysts said that strong demand and the near absence of new production capacity are likely to lead to price increases, particularly for newsprint and wood pulp. 
The price rises also could lead to a series of tough labor negotiations involving 30,000 paper workers in eastern Canada whose contracts expire April 30. 

   "This is the best situation the Canadian producers have had since 1978," said Brian Topp, an analyst at Capital Group Securities Ltd., Toronto. 

   Mr. Topp said he expects U.S. newsprint prices to rise about $30, or 5.3%, from the current level of $570 a metric ton, as early as May 1. 
Other analysts said they felt the price won't rise until later this year. 
U.S. newsprint prices went up 6.5% Oct. 1, the first such increase in 2 1/2 years. 

   "The psychology has changed," said Oscar Stangeland, president and chief operating officer of Montreal-based Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., a big newsprint supplier. 
"It is recognized that we are in a more shortage-prone period." 

   "It would seem as if a 1987 (price) increase is appropriate," said Mr. Stangeland, although he wouldn't elaborate on the timing and size of such a price boost. 

   But clouding the picture for the paper industry in eastern Canada are talks that are set to begin in March on a new labor agreement for 30,000 unionized employees at over 20 paper companies. 

   James Buchanan, president of the Canadian Paperworkers Union, said delegates to a convention here this week have set demands for a wage increase at 7.1% in the first year and 8% in the second year of the union's next two-year pact. 
The current average wage rate is $14.10 (Canadian) an hour, he said. 

   Mr. Buchanan said the workers' current contract has lost ground to increases in the cost of living, and "we're anticipating catching up." 
He said the union also wants improved pensions, a shorter work week and better job security. 

   But Consolidated-Bathurst's Mr. Stangeland termed the wage demands as "exaggerated" when compared with recent settlements at forest products producers in the U.S. and British Columbia. 
"One doesn't see how and why 7% and 8% would be appropriate." 

   According to the pulp and paper association, Canada's newsprint shipments are expected to grow 6.5% this year to 9.9 million metric tons, after rising an estimated 3% last year. 
Most of this year's growth is expected to come in the U.S. market, which depends on Canada for over half of its newsprint supplies. 

   Offshore exports of newsprint, which surged 15% in 1986, are expected to continue growing this year because of last year's decline in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to European currencies. 

   If the forecasts are accurate, Canada's newsprint portion of the industry will operate at 99% capacity this year, compared with 94% in 1986. 

   Raymond Kilroy, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., Toronto, said the forecast for a 99% operating rate may be overly optimistic, but "if you have an operating rate of 95% to 96%, it's a seller's market." 
He also expects pulp prices, which have gone up four times in the past year, to continue rising.

   MONTREAL -- Workers at three Stone Container Corp. paper
mills in Quebec narrowly ratified new labor contracts, but
the settlement, which sets the pattern for contracts covering
30,000 pulp and paper workers in eastern Canada, may run into
trouble at other mills.
   "We still face some difficulties in the rest of Canada,"
said Don Holder, president of the Canadian Paperworkers
Union. He said some companies may be reluctant to grant
workers perquisites, such as bonus vacation pay, which are
included in the contracts at Stone Container, a Chicago-based
paper and packaging concern. Given the slim margin of
approval at the three Stone Container mills, rejection of the
contract at some other mills is a possibility, Mr. Holder
said. He said the union leadership is satisfied with the
settlement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Just 56.4% of workers at the three Stone Container mills
voted in favor of the contract. The three-year agreement
includes an hourly wage increase of 85 Canadian cents (73
U.S. cents) in the first year and 5.5% pay increases in each
of the following two years. The current base wage at mills in
eastern Canada is 15.37 Canadian dollars (US$13.22) an hour.
   The three paper mills are operated by the
Stone-Consolidated Inc. unit of Stone Container. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Stone Container
shares closed at $15.75, up 12.5 cents.
   Analysts said the settlement may face a rough ride at
certain mills but generally expect that it will be adopted
without major problems throughout the region by the end of
the summer. They said the agreement at the Stone Container
mills removes the threat of an industrywide strike in eastern
Canada, because in pattern bargaining, other sites usually
fall in line with the initial settlement. This in turn may
force North American newsprint producers to give up a June 1
price increase. "There's definitely going to be pressure,"
said Stephen Atkinson, an analyst at Deacon BZW Ltd.
   The threat of a strike helped most major North American
newsprint producers push through price increases of about 5%
last month. Eastern Canada is a major source of newsprint for
U.S. and Canadian publishers. The benchmark Eastern U.S. list
price for newsprint rose 5.4% to $685 a metric ton from $650.
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. A similar increase took
effect in other markets, where the pricing system is slightly
different. Newsprint now is sold at about a 19% discount from
list price.
   In anticipation of a possible strike, publishers built up
their inventories of newsprint this spring. Analysts said
publishers now will probably reduce inventories.
   Separately on Friday, the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association said Canadian production of newsprint in May rose
2% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at 97% of
capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 847,000
metric tons of newsprint in May, compared with 830,000 tons a
year earlier. For the first five months of this year,
production fell 1.6% to 3,971,000 metric tons from 4,037,000
tons.
   The 97% operating rate in May was up from 93% in April and
96% in May 1989.
   The association said U.S. consumer stocks at the end of
May totaled 1,299,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, up from
1,276,000 tons at the end of April, a 37-day supply. Canadian
mills' stocks at the end of May totaled 358,000 metric tons,
down from 372,000 tons at the end of April.

   TORONTO -- Workers at most Abitibi-Price Inc. paper mills
in eastern Canada went on strike, shutting down about 7% of
North American newsprint capacity.
   Analysts and industry executives said a short strike won't
have much impact on the newsprint market. Other producers can
make up some of the production lost at Abitibi's mills. As
well, U.S. publishers and other users had an average 39-day
supply of newsprint on hand at the end of July, the latest
figures available.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a long strike could cause problems for publishers and
push up newsprint prices. "The newsprint market was pretty
tight already," said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc.
   Publishers are worried about possible strikes at other big
Canadian newsprint concerns. On Friday Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd. presented a final offer to workers at
three newsprint mills and one pulp mill in eastern Canada.
The company expects an answer by tomorrow, a spokesman said.
The three Canadian Pacific Forest newsprint mills account for
about 7% of North American capacity.
   Talks with Abitibi broke down late yesterday, a spokesman
for the Canadian Paperworkers Union said. The company
presented its final offer to the union early yesterday
morning. The union presented a counteroffer yesterday
afternoon but the company wouldn't alter its final proposal,
the union spokesman said.
   Industry and union officials said workers at Abitibi and
other pulp and paper mills in eastern Canada aren't happy
with the contract accepted earlier this summer by workers at
Stone Container Corp.'s Canadian unit. The Stone Container
contract was supposed to set the pattern for workers at other
mills in the region.
   The strike has shut down seven Abitibi mills in Ontario,
Quebec and Newfoundland, six of which make newsprint, Abitibi
said. A union official said two other mills in Quebec are
expected to join the strike. Abitibi mills at Alma, Quebec,
and Pine Falls, Manitoba, which are represented by other
unions, will continue to operate, Abitibi said. As well, the
company's two U.S. mills aren't affected by the strike. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Abitibi closed at
$13.375, down 12.5 cents.
   Separately, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
Canadian production of newsprint rose 1.4% in July from a
year earlier as the industry operated at 94% of capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 826,000
metric tons of newsprint in July compared with 815,000 metric
tons a year earlier. For the year to date, output fell 1.4%
to 5.56 million metric tons from 5.64 million metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   The July 94% operating rate was down from 95% in May and
from 96% a year earlier.
   July shipments fell 3.0% to 751,000 metric tons from
775,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to Canada rose

   Canadian newsprint production dropped 3.3% in July from year-ago levels, as strikes during the latest month disrupted production at several paper mills in eastern Canada. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 791,000 metric tons of newsprint in July, compared with 818,000 tons a year earlier. 
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds. 

   As previously reported, strikes lasting between a few days and several weeks halted output in July at newsprint mills operated by Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., Donohue Inc., and the CIP Inc. unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. 
All of the strikes have since been settled with the signing of new labor agreements. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 92% of its rated capacity in July, down from 97% in June and 96% in July 1986. 

   Shipments increased 2.8% to 779,000 metric tons in July from 758,000 tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, totaled 576,000 metric tons, 3.2% ahead of the 558,000 tons shipped a year earlier. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint rose 5.7% to 984,000 metric tons in July from 931,000 tons a year ago. 
In the first seven months of this year, U.S. newsprint consumption is 2.5% ahead of 1986 levels. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint totaled 1,461,000 metric tons at the end of July, representing a 43-day supply, up 3.8% from 1,407,000 tons at the end of June, or a 44-day supply, and up 3.6% from 1,410,000 tons at the end of July 1986, or a 43-day supply.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian newsprint production fell 0.6% in
October from a year earlier as the industry operated at 79%
of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 706,000 metric tons of
newsprint in October compared with 711,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The October 79% operating rate was down from 85% in
September and up from 78% a year ago.

   Though production fell slightly, the operating rate was
higher in October compared with a year earlier because
available newsprint capacity was slightly lower than a year
earlier. Some paper machines that ordinarily make newsprint
were used to make other grades of paper in October and
therefore weren't included in available capacity.
   October shipments rose 3.6% to 735,000 metric tons from
710,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to the U.S.
fell 4.9% to 488,000 metric tons from 513,000 metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   For the first 10 months, Canadian newsprint production
fell 2.1% to 7,523,000 metric tons from 7,688,000 metric tons
a year earlier. Canadian mills operated at 87% of capacity in
the first 10 months compared with 90% a year earlier.
Shipments for the first 10 months fell 5.4% to 7,232,000
metric tons from 7,647,000 metric tons a year ago.
   The association said U.S. consumer stocks at the end of
October were 1,324,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, compared
with 1,269,000 metric tons, a 37-day supply, a year earlier.
Canadian mills' stocks at the end of October were 606,000
metric tons compared with 363,000 metric tons a year earlier.

   MONTREAL -- The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
it expects 1991 pulp and paper shipments to rise 1.9% to
24.62 million metric tons from 24.15 million metric tons a
year earlier.
   The industry group said that according to preliminary
figures, Canadian pulp and paper shipments last year declined
about 2.9%, or 715,000 metric tons, from 1989 levels. A
metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.

   The association said its forecast is based on the
expectation that the North American economy will start to
grow and inflationary pressures will decrease during the
second half. It said pulp and paper markets should begin to
improve by this summer and Canadian pulp and paper production
should rise slightly over 1990.
   The association said the ratio of industry shipments to
rated production capacity was 87% in 1990 compared with 93%
in 1989. It said industry capacity is expected to rise 1.6
million metric tons, or 6%, to 28.7 million metric tons in
1991. As a result, the ratio of shipments to rated capacity
is expected to fall three points to 84% in 1991.
   The association made the following forecasts for Canadian
shipments of pulp and paper products, compared with
preliminary estimates for 1990. All figures are in metric
tons:

   f-forecast, p-preliminary. To avoid double counting pulp
shipments include exports only because pulp shipped to
Canadian customers is used to make paper products.
