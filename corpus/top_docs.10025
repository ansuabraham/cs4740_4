  [Text] Cuba's cooperation with Bolivia has solved the 
serious health problems of about 5,000 [Bolivian] children. 
Furthermore, "many Bolivians are walking about with Cuban 
kidneys," Cuba's ambassador, Angel Gustavo Bruguez Perez, said 
yesterday. 
  At the end of a formal farewell visit to Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the Cuban diplomat completed his 
mission with a report on his 10 years in La Paz. 
  He spoke of the health care programs his country's 
government 
has supported in Bolivia, including the establishment of three 
intensive care facilities for children in the cities of La Paz, 
Santa Cruz, and Sucre, where the lives of 5,000 children have 
been saved. He said that thousands of Bolivian citizens are now 
walking about with Cuban kidneys. These people went to Cuba for 
specialized medical treatment. 
  Bruguez was decorated with the "Condor of the Andes" medal 
with the Great Cross, in recognition of his work to benefit 
Bolivia during the 10 years he headed his country's diplomatic 
legation. 
  Certain that he will return to Bolivia, the diplomat said he 
will again stroll along Avenida Buenos Aires or the Rodriguez 
Market. He said he has established a home in La Paz and that his 
children are studying in Bolivia. He also spoke of Cuba's 
cooperation in sports, especially for Bolivian participation in 
the Bolivar Olympic Games. 
  Minister of Foreign Relations Antonio Aranibar said: 
"Despite 
the enormous difficulties facing the Cuban people, their 
government has provided significant cooperation in the fields of 
education, health, and sports."

and 16 conceded. They face Germany in the opening match of the tournament. A
heavy defeat there could destroy their confidence, built up so well by
Spanish coach Xavier Azkargorta.
Six of the Bolivian squad, including Bolivia's best player, Marco Etcheverry
(Colo Colo), are graduates of one of sport's strangest institutions: the
Tahuichi Academy. It was formed 15 years ago to take the poor children off
the streets of Santa Cruz and has become world famous for the skilful
footballers it has produced. Etcheverry is struggling with an injury.
Without him Bolivia's warm-up results were mixed.
The Bolivians will find it tough to go far in the World Cup, but at least
they will be able to drink America's favourite drink. The head of the
Bolivian federation banned the players from drinking Coca Cola fearing dope
tests would be positive. He later relented.

LANDLOCKED Bolivia's 113 year-old dream of an exit to the Pacific is set to
become reality today when Bolivian and Peruvian presidents Jaime Paz Zamora
and Alberto Fujimori meet in the southern Peruvian port of Ilo to sign a
bilateral agreement.
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has made an offer of free transit for
Bolivian products through a 'corridor' leading to Ilo from the Bolivian
frontier town of Desaguadero.
Under Mr Fujimori's proposal:
Bolivia would be permitted to import and export via Ilo with no customs
formalities - perhaps even using their own railway stock on the Peruvian
tracks;
Ilo would become a free zone with full industrial and commercial facilities;
and,
Bolivians could even purchase their own seaside residences in a new tourist
resort on Peruvian soil.
The Peruvian proposal has been enthusiastically greeted in Bolivia, which
has been landlocked since it lost territory to Chile in the 1879 War of the
Pacific.
In return for the concessions, Peru would gain access to the Atlantic, via
the network of roads and railways which link Desaguadero to the Bolivian
capital, La Paz, and thence to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.
Ilo, which is less than 300 miles from La Paz, hopes to lure lucrative
Bolivian trade away from the northern Chilean ports of Arica.
President Fujimori's plan gives priority to Ilo as the principal port for
Peruvian and Bolivian (and ultimately Brazilian) exports to the Pacific Rim
countries.
It is a deep-water port with good basic infrastructure but will require
further substantial investment and development.
Before leaving for Ilo, the Bolivian president called the meeting one of
'transcendental importance'.
'This is a signal to the rest of the continent,' he said, 'that there's a
new way of managing affairs.'

  [Text] Zhanjiang, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A group of Bolivian 
visitors headed by H. Alfonso Ferrufino Valderrama, 
vice-president of Bolivia's Chamber of Deputies, said that they 
will take Zhanjiang as a base to enhance economic and trade 
cooperation between Bolivia and China. 
  Situated on the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province, 
Zhanjiang city is one of eight major sea ports in China. 
  During their business tour in Zhanjiang city, the Bolivian 
guests visited Nansan Island near the city. 
  The island occupies 123.4 square kilometers with 34 percent 
of its land covered with forests. 
  The Bolivian guests consider the island an ideal place for 
establishing a trade base between Bolivia and China. 
  Eduardo la Fuente Roca, general manager of the Industrial 
and 
Commercial Chamber of Cochabamba of Bolivia, said that the base 
will provide an opportunity for businessmen in Latin American 
countries to engage in free trade and entrepot trade. 
  He said that his chamber has sent letters to related Chinese 
departments to apply to establish of a business center in 
Zhanjiang city. 
  The Bolivian businessmen also expressed their intention to 
invest in flower raising and refined processing of livestock 
products.

 [From the "National Radio News"] 
  [Text] On 27 June in Havana, Bolivian Ambassador Juan 
Franklin Anaya Vasquez said that Cuba and Bolivia are currently 
engaged in strengthening political and economic relations. Anaya 
told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and Bolivia have nearly completed 
an air navigation agreement. The accord, once signed, will allow 
for Cubana de Aviacion and (Lloyd) Aero Boliviano planes to fly 
between La Paz and Havana. Anaya emphasized the importance of 
this accord, based on increased tourism to Cuba, not only from 
Bolivia, but also from other nations of the region's southern 
cone. 
  Anaya added in his statement to PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and 
Bolivia are analyzing increased trade in several areas. La Paz 
is studying the possibilities of a visit with Cuban authorities 
in Havana by Bolivian businessmen, enabling them to identify 
possibilities for investment. Anaya noted that politically, 
Bolivia condemns the inhumane U.S. blockade against Cuba just as 
it condemns other measures that oppress the people. Anaya 
pointed out that in the area of culture, the work done by Cuban 
teachers in all fields has been positive, with emphasis on 
ballet specialists and various artistic groups.

  [Excerpt] Outlining the course he will set for 
Chilean-Bolivian relations, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
said: "We must explore a whole world of possibilities in our 
relations with Bolivia." Our relations with Bolivia have time 
and again been marred by sporadic reactions by Bolivian military 
officials, who have demanded, through unusual appeals, an outlet 
to the sea for their country. 
  This is what happened on 22 March when the Bolivian Army 
commander, General Reynaldo Caceres, called for a change in the 
"thoughtless, obstinate attitude of the Chilean ruling class" 
regarding the Bolivian landlocked situation, a position out of 
keeping with history." 
  Figueroa was asked on 23 March about the approach he will 
take regarding relations with Bolivia in light of the various 
aspects posed by this issue. On the one hand, there have been 
friendly gestures such as the cordial talks held by Figueroa 
with Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, as well as the 
visit paid to Chile to attend the presidential inauguration by 
Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, the wife of the 
Bolivian president, who conveyed a message to the Chilean 
people. On the other hand, these gestures have been overshadowed 
by remarks such as that by Gen. Caceres. 
  First, Figueroa said he will not comment on "remarks by 
third 
parties," alluding to Caceres. Second, he outlined his position 
regarding "the course" he will take in our relations with 
Bolivia. 
  Figueroa said: "It is Chile's desire to have the best 
possible relations with Bolivia, in order to seek ways for 
understanding in the areas of politics, economics, culture, and 
tourism and for investment and infrastructure development in 
border areas. There is a whole world of possibilities that must 
be explored to develop these relations." 
  Figueroa outlined his position in a meeting he held with 
Aranibar in Brasilia on 22 March. The two foreign ministers 
took advantage of a meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers to 
hold bilateral talks in Brasilia. At the end of the meeting, 
Figueroa talked about searching for "creative formulas" to 
develop Chilean-Bolivian ties. On 23 March he emphasized the 
need for these formulas. 
  "These formulas could be applied within the whole spectrum 
of 
cooperation and to the work that two countries like Chile and 
Bolivia -- which truly seek to maintain good relations -- could 
undertake." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Bolivian foreign affairs and finance ministers 
begin an official visit to Spain today in Madrid in search of 
business partners among Spanish firms for their state 
telecommunications, electricity, petrol, gas, air transport, and 
railway companies. 
  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga and 
Finance Minister Fernando Alvaro Cosio [name as received], have 
a full agenda including meetings with King Juan Carlos, Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Foreign Minister Javier Solana, as 
well as Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, Interior Minister 
Antoni Asuncion, and Trade Minister Javier Gomez-Navarro. In 
addition, they will have a business breakfast with Spanish 
businessmen. 
  Bolivia has started a program of state company 
privatizations 
in which the private partner will take total control of the 
management for an ongoing term and will be the sole owner of the 
profits. 
  Spanish aid for Bolivia is another item on the agenda. Since 
1989 Spain has granted credits to Bolivia worth $200 million, 
half of which have been used, while the rest is waiting for the 
Bolivian projects to be financed to be identified.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
evaluated relations between Bolivia and the United States. He 
said they are "narcotized," adding that Bolivian and U.S. 
antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results. 
  The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and 
alternative development programs. He admitted that "they have 
had no visible effects" in either the United States or Bolivia. 
  Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is 
"controversial" and has caused confrontations in the search for 
consensus. 
  He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia 
has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S. 
market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers "have had no 
guarantees on the sale of their products to that country." 
  The minister said the peasants have found no market for 
their 
products and, because of the economic nature of this problem, 
they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort. 
  Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained 
between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations 
was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit 
established. 
  He said: "This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very 
great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the 
cultivated areas." He added: "This caused a debate on the 
benefits of the policy and on its success or failure." 
  In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the 
traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical 
significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which 
is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements. 
  This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized 
Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and 
exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression 
of traffickers with alternative development.

Titicaca, I, too, enjoyed Christina Lamb's dispatch ('The Navy lark',
September 11/12).
Some variations on the story behind Queen Victoria's demand that Bolivia be
expunged from British maps are even more curious than that recounted by Mr
Whiteley. The reason for the British ambassador being ignominiously removed
from La Paz, tied backwards on a donkey, is said to have been his refusal to
accede to President Malgarejo's insistence that the diplomatic corps drink
from the same bowl as his favourite horse, Holofernes, which regularly
attended the bibulous banquets frequently offered at the palace.
Queen Victoria's initial reaction is alleged to have been 'send in the
navy'. It was on being told that Bolivia was a landlocked country that she
changed the punishment to deletion from the map.
As I pointed out in my book, 'Gate of the Sun', however, this must be an
apocryphal story since Bolivia had not then lost its coastline, an event
that happened a few years later.

  [Text] Bolivia and Brazil today signed a new bilateral 
agreement. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim arrived in 
our country to sign it. 
  It should be recalled that Bolivia and Brazil signed a 
partial agreement in 1983. The new agreement not only grants 
preferential tariffs -- which involve reduced taxes on imports 
-- but also provides for business cooperation and the exchange 
of commercial information. 
  [Begin Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar recording] 
It proves the fruitful talks and exchange of viewpoints that we 
maintained during an active day with Foreign Minister Amorim. 
[end recording] 
  There are two very important points in the joint communique. 
For example, Bolivia and Brazil reaffirmed their predisposition 
to make efforts so that the agreements between Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] countries and Bolivia -- aiming at allowing 
Bolivia's full participation -- will be given priority within 
the regional process. 
  As for Bolivian-Brazilian integration in the energy field, 
the two ministers reiterated the importance and priority that 
the governments of Brazil and Bolivia have attached to the 
natural gas purchase contract signed by Petrobras [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] and Bolivian Government Oil Deposits. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] At this meeting I obviously could 
not discuss technical details because this must be done by the 
Petrobras people. But I believe the important thing is the 
political reaffirmation of our determination to develop this 
project, which is important for Bolivia and also very important 
for Brazil. [end recording] 
  This was the conclusion of the official visit paid by 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who thanked Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar for the expressions of 
appreciation and friendship extended to him.

   From Mr PHILIP WHITELEY


Sir, I loved Christina Lamb's description of the Bolivian navy ('Despatches:
The navy lark', September 11/12), but what a shame she doesn't know the
story behind the disappearance of the country from Victorian maps and the
British collusion with Chile to rob Bolivia of its access to the sea.
The problem began with an unfortunate decision by Bolivia's humorous but
mentally ill president of the 1860s, Mariano Melgarejo. He decided to punish
the British ambassador for having the temerity to say that he didn't much
care for the qualities of chicha (part-fermented wine: a South American
favourite of the period). His punishment was to drink an entire barrel of
chocolate and then be led, facing backwards, astride a donkey through the
main street of La Paz. He was sent back to London.
In response, Queen Victoria reputedly asked for a map of South America, drew
a cross in chalk through Bolivia, and declared furiously: 'Bolivia doesn't
exist.'
Britain was, in fact, the real victor of the War of the Pacific, for while
Chile gained the territory, a convenient coup prevented President Balmaceda
from nationalising the nitrate mining concerns, which remained under the
control of the Liverpool Nitrate Company.

  [Text] Through a document signed on 18 March by Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella and his Bolivian counterpart, Antonio 
Aranibar, shortly before Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada ended the visit he paid to Argentina at President Carlos 
Menem's invitation, Argentina and Bolivia agreed to partially 
deregulate the trade of hydrocarbons and their byproducts. 
  In addition, the chiefs of state asked their advisers to 
conduct a two-month study of an agreement authorizing the two 
countries' goods to freely cross their common border, without 
paying customs fees. These goods are to be used in competitive 
manufacturing plants in Bolivia, to be sold in the two 
countries' markets, and to be exported to third countries. 
  This is stated in the long joint declaration that should 
have 
been released on 17 March, but was only released the following 
day. 
  It is stated in the declaration that Bolivia will supply to 
Argentina gas under equal conditions as the gas that is produced 
here, and a binational commission will be created to study the 
situation of Bolivian immigrants. This commission will recommend 
urgent solutions to the problem. 
  It has been learned that Argentina will deem this commission 
a pilot experiment in solving the problems of foreigners 
immigrating from neighboring countries. 
  The agreement on oil establishes overall and reciprocal 
deregulation of import tariffs on crude oil and gas (from 
Bolivia) and oil byproducts (from Argentina) as mentioned in an 
attached list.

This important document was signed during the visit Paraguayan

  The Bolivian foreign minister and his Paraguayan counterpart

Grande, Bolivia, and Asuncion, Paraguay, for supplying Bolivian 
natural and liquefied petroleum gas to that nation. 
  [Begin Ramirez Boettner recording] I believe the work we did

  Among the issues we addressed -- because we addressed

Paraguay. [end recording]. 
  In addition to the Bolivian president's visit to Paraguay, 
other major issues were considered like economic 
supplementation; a tripartite agreement on the Pilcomayo River 
by Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Paraguay-Parana 
waterway; and the Trans-Chaco Highway. 
  Concerning the sale of gas to Paraguay, the price and volume 
will be decided at a meeting of specialists from Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits and a Paraguayan private enterprise. 
  The construction of the gas pipeline will be totally 
financed 
with private capital. [passage omitted]

President Bush today assured Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora that "you and 
your countrymen will not stand alone" in fighting cocaine and trying to improve 
Bolivia's ailing economy. 


Winding up three hours of talks at the White House, Bush promised that he would 
seek a substantial increase in economic aid for Bolivia next year, beyond the 
$88 million earmarked for this year. He said Paz, in their private talks, had 
stressed the importance of Bolivia's receiving development assistance.

   LA PAZ


BOLIVIAN MINING officials say it is now almost certain that a deal to mine
the world's biggest reserves of lithium, a light, heat-resistant metal used
in the manufacture of aluminium, ceramics and glass, is to be shelved
indefinitely.
The collapse after five years of negotiations, between Lithco, a subsidiary
of the FMC corporation, and successive Bolivian governments should be
announced officially by early February. Lithco has given the government 30
days to shift its negotiating position, an eventuality now seen as extremely
unlikely.
This was a crucial deal for both parties. Lithco, facing competition in the
lithium field from Cyprus Minerals, already present in neighbouring Chile,
and needing a surface mining operation to enable it to convince foreign
investors it was ready to do business, was equally eager for a deal.
According to calculations by Mr Fernando Urquidi Barrau, a respected
observer of the mining scene, the Bolivian government stood to make about
Dollars 30m a year for the 40 year duration of the contracts.
The affair will further damage Bolivia's image with foreign investors,
particularly in the light of the recent fiasco over joint venture contracts
between the private and state sectors. While emphasising that existing
private mining ventures fare well, Mr Charles Bruce, executive vice
president of mining consultants, Mintec, acknowledges this is a 'black eye
for the government'.
Despite appearances, however, the government is not entirely to blame. As Mr
Urquidi contends: 'It looks as if Bolivia kicked Lithco out, but this is an
incorrect impression'.
Mr Urquidi speculates that Lithco was using both the Salar de Uyuni deposit
in Bolivia and the similar Salar del Hombre Muerto deposit in Argentina as
bargaining chips in a bid to secure rights to the Atacama deposit in Chile.
Observers believe Lithco may have already signed a contract with Amax
Minerals and Energy, the American company that owns the rights to the
Chilean deposit.
Lithco has been a tough negotiator with Bolivia throughout. It insisted on a
40-year contract with a ceiling of 400,000 tonnes of lithium. In addition,
it demanded a 10 per cent VAT rate rather than the usual 13 per cent. The
Bolivian government eventually agreed to these terms, reducing its profit
share rather than openly caving in on the VAT issue. The contract was signed
by the Bolivian president on February 1992 and ratified by congress, though
with three additional clauses which proved unacceptable to the company.
It is widely believed that Lithco had by then decided to pursue the Chilean
deposit. Although Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni is believed to hold the largest
lithium deposits in the world, it is apparently contaminated by high
quantities of magnesium, which complicates the exploitation process.
Infrastructure in Chile is far better. Furthermore, Chile is perceived to be
more politically stable than Bolivia. Ultimately this was crucial in
Bolivia's loss of the deal.
Lithco and Cyprus are the only corporations with the capability to mine
lithium on such a scale. Both have now apparently secured deposits which
will see them into the next century, leaving Bolivia out in the cold.

The state oil companies of Brazil and Bolivia have put out to international
tender a contract to supply equipment and services for the planned
Brazil-Bolivia gas pipe line.
Work on the first stage of the pipeline, from Rio Grande in Bolivia to Porto
Alegre in Brazil, is expected to start next August. The project is expected
to use 2,200km of pipeline and will cost Dollars 2.2bn.
The pipeline should provide income of Dollars 200m a year for Bolivia. The
two companies have already selected a number of large international
companies as strategic partners in the project.

    Bolivia To Participate in Meetings

  [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the 
meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit, 
which 
ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto 
Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their 
satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and 
strengthen its ties with Mercosur. 
  The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate 
to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives 
to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work 
subgroups." 
  The presidents also state that "within the framework of 
Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized 
with the perspective of its future total participation in 
Mercosur." 
  President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an 
observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in 
Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia 
has signed. 
  Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already 
belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through 
a free market system. 
  The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we 
must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American 
integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate 
borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries' 
leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered 
themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American 
family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen 
and risen many times, but we are learning." 
  "With past experience and the demands of our current times, 
we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of 
integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added. 
  "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the 
Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of 
making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he 
stated. 
  Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role 
in this process by being a point in common and a contact among 
regional groups. We are willing to play the role that 
corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep 
integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate, 
Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."

Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself, two of Bolivia's most far-sighted
men are entrepreneurs who, after spending many years outside their native
land, have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into
reality.
One is Mr Joaquin Aguirre, author, philosopher, playwright, businessman and
now the owner of Bolivia's only genuinely functioning port on the Paraguay
River: it bears his name, Puerto Aguirre.
'The Paraguay-Parana hidrovia (waterway) is to our continent what the
Mississippi is to the US,' he says, 'but over the centuries Latin Americans
have done everything possible to ignore it.'
Aguirre found plans for a river port and waterway already gathering dust in
the foreign ministry's archives when he was a young man.
Only after 30 years of globe-trotting - during which he built the gas
pipeline to Argentina, founded a supermarket chain in Colombia and patented
sugar made from bananas - did he return to Bolivia to explore the waterway
route in the mid-1970s.
Since 1983, Mr Aguirre says he has invested Dollars 10m in Puerto Aguirre
from his own savings and loans: other private entrepreneurs have put in
another Dollars 28m.
The 1986 World Bank report on the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, which gave
the green light - and initial credit - to soya farming in the zone,
described him as 'a man of vision, passion and action'.
Mr Aguirre, now in his seventies, believes integration will be achieved by
entrepreneurs rather than governments.
A permanent, five-country 'hidrovia' commission now exists and is already
moving ahead with waterway improvements.
This year, he says, his 'pipe-dream' Puerto Aguirre will move 200,000 tonnes
of cargo, mainly soya.
Like Mr Aguirre, Mr Julio Leon Prado made most of his money in other Latin
American countries over a 30-year period - chiefly in power transmission
lines and construction.
His many-tentacled Banco Industrial group is now Bolivia's leader in
financial services.
But Mr Leon Prado is a frontiersman at heart. Although he is nearly 70 years
old, in the past few years he has spearheaded Bolivia's booming soya
industry and is now the country's largest individual farmer.
'When I expanded to 2,000 hectares, they said I was crazy. But I told them,
if you need two tractors for 2,000 hectares, you need twenty for 20,000:
it's that simple.'
With yields of 3.2 tonnes a hectare, Mr Leon can match the world's most
productive soya farmers. He praises the Japanese settlers in the region east
of Santa Cruz for realising the land's rich potential:
'They revolutionised alised Bolivian agriculture, proving how fertile it
is.'
For Mr Leon, soya represents the future of Bolivia. 'It's a primary industry
and best of all, it's forever because it's sustainable. There's business
here for everyone.' He is lending money, supplying seeds, sharing technology
and weather reports with small farmers in a push to get a million hectares
of Bolivian lowlands under soya.
'That means 3m tonnes of beans a year, which is a point of no return,' he
says. Bolivian soya, plus the produce from south-west Brazil, will exert
irresistible pressure on governments and private companies to get adequate
transportation infrastructure in place.
'Joaquin Aguirre is one of Bolivia's great visionaries,' Mr Leon
acknowledges.
'But I think time will prove him wrong. I believe Bolivia's future lies
westwards, out through Peru to the Pacific.'

   LA PAZ


BOLIVIA'S MINING industry, which has only just begun to recover from the
market crash caused by the collapse of the International Tin Council's
buffer stock operation in 1985, is bracing itself for a second shock.
Both the private and public sectors have already suffered a depressing
opening to the new year. Lithco pulled out of a Dollars 1.5bn deal with the
Bolivian government in January. Shortly afterwards Jordex Resources withdrew
after selling its majority stake in Minera Tiwanacu. Some private mining
concerns, including Britain's RTZ are said to be considering slimming down
their presence in Bolivia.
Two existing joint ventures between Comibol, the state mining corporation,
Cominesa and a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema are still inoperable
because of union opposition. The government's continuing reluctance to
tackle the unions means further joint venture contracts are likely to be
stalled before the June general elections.
This already fragile situation is complicated by the fall in international
prices for zinc, which now tops Bolivia's mining production, and also gold,
silver, wolfram and antimony. Bolivian mining minister Mr Alvaro Rejas
believes the industry is facing a crisis similar to that caused by the
collapse of tin prices in 1985, when some 23,000 state miners were made
redundant.
