TV REVIEW; 


POIROT MEETS HIS MAKER IN A&amp;E'S 'MURDER BY THE BOOK' 




By IRV LETOFSKY 




Hercule Poirot, all greased and arrogant as usual, has come to investigate a 
murder -- his own. 


And when he learns that it will not be an interesting murder but a simple, 
mundane and everyday heart attack, he is furious. 


(We know his ego.) He insists to his Maker that he "wants a proper death worthy 
of both of us!" 


"Murder by the Book," an hour drama airing Sunday at 5 p.m. and again at 9 p.m. 
on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network, is written and produced by Nick 
Evans and stars Ian Holm as the wily Belgian and Peggy Ashcroft as his Maker, 
Agatha Christie. 


As the story here has it, Christie wrote the final book on Poirot 35 years ago, 
putting him to eternal rest. But she was talked out of publishing it -- until 
now. Poirot hears of this and turns up in the night. 


It's a romp, these old-pro actors doing old-pro masterminds of murder, 
battering each other with repartee and screaming frustrations. Agatha is 
jealous that everybody is always asking about Poirot, Poirot, Poirot. He rages 
that, after all, it is he who sells all her books -- and he has never forgiven 
her tiny little brain cells for composing him as some silly, "narcissistic 
penguin." 


Reason expended on both sides, they invoke knives and guns and Agatha's special 
favorite, poison. 


We can't divulge the ending except to report the most obvious fact -- that 
these folks will never die. IRV LETOFSKY

STAGE REVIEW; 


GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE'S 'BLACK COFFEE' PROVES A BIT WEAK; 


THE PRODUCTION OF AGATHA CHRISTIE'S FIRST PLAY SUFFERS FROM STAGING 
DIFFICULTIES AND UNREALIZED CHARACTERS. 




By MARK CHALON SMITH 




HUNTINGTON BEACH 




Agatha Christie fans may be interested in "Black Coffee" at Golden West 
College, if only because it's one of the few plays featuring Hercule Poirot, 
the Belgian sleuth Christie created for her many mystery novels. 


At Poirot's side in this 1930 whodunit is Capt. Hastings, the detective's usual 
man Friday. Even hapless Inspector Japp, another familiar Christie invention, 
makes an appearance. Add to this the fact that "Black Coffee" was the first 
play written by the prodigious author and the plot thickens for Christie 
die-hards. 


Unfortunately, it's a slow-moving production offered by GWC, one that makes 
mistakes in the basic presentation and prevents "Black Coffee" from having the 
needed kick to keep us savoring throughout. 


The decision to stage this mystery -- about the suspicious death of Sir Claude 
Amory (Robert Schmaltz III) and the swiping of his atomic weapons blueprint -- 
in a theater-in-the-round setting is something of a mystery in itself. We 
gather evidence and follow character development from expressions and 
attitudes, but it's not always easy to pick them up from the various vantage 
points. 


Despite David P. Falzon's detailed set, the staging results in blocking 
difficulties for director Steven Jay Warner, which results in accessibility 
difficulties for the audience. 


The cast, with few exceptions, doesn't always make the most of Christie's 
characters, as usual a colorful lot with veneers of humor. The English accents 
are in place, but not much of the eccentric stylization that can make this type 
of antique more amusing. 


Only Simone Slifman as the vivacious Barbara Amory and Eric Hansen as Hastings 
bring enough waggish impulse to the arch roles. 


As for Poirot, Douglas L. Hartman is comical all right, but he doesn't really 
meet our expectations of this grandly rich and, at times, insufferable 
character. Hartman portrays him as meticulous, as he should, but it's more of a 
mincing mannerism than the manifestation of a precisely analytical mind. 


'BLACK COFFEE' 


A Golden West College production of Agatha Christie's play. Directed by Steven 
Jay Warner. With Gary Wos, Stephanie McCully, Marsha Clark, John McMillan, 
Simone Slifman, David A. Nelson, Frank Liddy, Robert Schmaltz III, Douglas L. 
Hartman, Eric Hansen and Kirk D. Brown. Set by David P. Falzon. Lighting by

STAGE REVIEW; 


TIME SPRINGS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 'MOUSETRAP' 




By MARK CHALON SMITH 




WESTMINSTER 




Next to "Twin Peaks," David Lynch's weird, funny and invigorating retooling of 
the murder mystery, Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap" would look like a house 
cat standing alongside a drunken leopard with purple spots. 


OK, maybe that's a little strong. And it's probably not fair comparing a play 
that opened nearly four decades ago to a television series designed to kick off 
the '90s. That doesn't change the fact, though, that to a contemporary 
audience, "The Mousetrap" is likely to seem antique and predictable. 


What about venerability? Can't "The Mousetrap," now at Westminster Community 
Theatre, be enjoyed as a classic, an example of Christie's craftsmanship and 
period-perfect plotting and characters? 


Maybe, by Christie die-hards at least. But others probably will find it rather 
quaint. Despite its popularity -- "The Mousetrap" remains the longest-running 
drama in London, the touristy stage equivalent of Big Ben -- the whodunit isn't 
even representative of Christie's best work. Stick with the novels for that. 


The plot is as musty as the Gothic mansion in which it is set: While a 
snowstorm gets nasty outside, a collage of peculiar people gathers at Monkswell 
Manor for the night. Eyebrows raise, and sidelong looks abound. The radio 
crackles with bad news about a deranged killer. He's among them, of course, and 
he wants revenge. Bodies are soon to fall. 


The play's best aspect is its eccentric characters, and director Jeanne Sanner 
employs them as best she can. Pumping up their as-written oddness to comic 
proportions, she has come up with a vaguely out-of-kilter, fairly amusing first 
act that almost overcomes the play's deficiencies. 


But "The Mousetrap" has thuddingly dull patches where nothing much happens, and 
the time is filled by unrevealing talk and opaque red herrings. By the second 
act, this whodunit is barely moving along. Even the sometimes sophisticated wit 
of Christie's dialogue can't maintain the momentum. 


The cast tries gamely. Jim Hannah's swishy fop of an architect, Christopher 
Wren, is all fluttery mannerisms and shrieking syllables. Cliched, it 
nonetheless succeeds in eliciting laughs. A more interesting character is the 
cynical and shadowy Miss Casewell (Danielle Desmond). 


The Ralstons, the young, somewhat blank-brained owners of the mansion, are 
played with baffled good-humor by JoAnne K. Binkley and Michael O'Brien Jr. The 
ominous Sgt. Trotter is given a decent reading by Eric F. Chandler, though he 
does get a tad wiggy at the end. 


'THE MOUSETRAP'

TEAM SPIRIT HELPS REPRISE AN ACCESSIBLE AGATHA CHRISTIE WHODUNIT 




By JANICE ARKATOV 




Bruce Gray figures that Agatha Christie is a name people can trust. 


"It's a great way to bring someone into the theater who's never been there 
before," said the director. "For people who might be afraid of going to see 
Shakespeare or Chekhov or even David Rabe, Agatha Christie is something they 
are comfortable with. 


"Theater can be very confrontative. And when it really works well, it can be 
upsetting. But this is accessible. When people come to see Agatha Christie, 
they know what they're in for." 


This weekend, Gray's staging of Christie's "The Unexpected Guest" opens at the 
Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood, in a reprise of his acclaimed production 
that ran at Beverly Hills' Theatre 40 in June. 


"It's more than a whodunit," emphasized Gray, 52. "It deals with bigger 
issues." 


The play begins with the title character entering a dark room and coming upon a 
dead man -- and the victim's wife standing next to him with a gun. "The victim 
is one of those Hemingway-type men: into big-game hunting, lived fast, drank a 
lot. Then he was mauled by a lion in Kenya and became a cripple. And all the 
things that were wonderful about him disappeared; all the terrible things 
bubbled to the surface." 


 -- -- 


The suspects are all members of the household. "This man had disrupted and 
alienated and abused everyone in the family," Gray explained. "He was just an 
awful human being who deserved to die. There's even something about the room 
that's violent. It's filled with African masks and skulls, animal heads, zebra 
and tiger skins, an elephant foot stuffed with magazines and newspapers. I 
mean, it's really awful. But now he's dead -- and how do they feel about it?" 


The director's own feelings are definitely mixed with nostalgia. Born in Puerto 
Rico, he grew up in Michigan, got a master's in psychology from the University 
of Toronto and moved to England in the late '50s, where he ended up modeling 
and acting. Eventually, he was invited to join the Theatre Royal in Bath -- 
where one of his 14-plays-in-14-weeks repertory included a role in "The 
Unexpected Guest." 


This time around with the show, Gray only had eyes for directing. 


"I can't do them both -- acting and directing," he said firmly. "The 
directing's too demanding. As a director, at the opening of a play, I'm totally 
spent. There's nothing I haven't had a hand in: the set design, the costumes, 
the lighting, the sound, getting the flyers done, the programs, making sure 
everything has the right look about it. It's a huge management job: managing a 
cast of nine and a crew of 20 and getting them to work harmoniously -- for 
appalling money." 


Financial woes notwithstanding, team spirit has been strong: "It's like Mickey 
Rooney-Judy Garland 'Let's put on a show,' " Gray said proudly. "One of the 
people in the cast took on the moving: 'It will be my job to move all the 
furniture and flats to the Tiffany.' Someone else said, 'I'll do the programs.' 
Someone else is handling the opening-night party. Everyone is acting as 
producers, pulling together. It's not Bruce Gray who's going into this theater. 
It's this company." 


In spite of the rigors involved in mounting a show, Gray believes that the 
theater is worth it. 


"I think it's a very different experience going to a theater than going to a 
movie," he said. "In theater, there's much more of a relationship between the 
members of the audience and the show -- and it's different every night. 


"The first time I went to a theater I remember wondering, 'Gee, what goes on 
here? Is it going to be embarrassing? Are they going to ask me questions?' 
Theater is very present, you know. An actor can suddenly decide to walk off the 
stage and sit next to you. That's part of it." 


 -- -- 


Gray's own acting has run the gamut from a slew of New York soap operas to 10 
years at Circle Repertory and films such as "Dragnet" and "Let's Get Harry." 
Since moving here in 1980, he has developed high visibility in what a friend 
calls "suit acting": playing lawyers on "Dynasty," "Dallas," "Knots Landing," 
"The Colbys" and the new daytime soap "Generations." 


"Acting and directing address different parts of your talent," Gray pointed 
out. "As a director, there's a feeling of emptying yourself into a show: your 
sensibilities, your judgment, your willingness to be the wall. Sometimes an 
actor wants that; they want you to say no. Other actors don't need that. It's 
about dealing with people, understanding a group dynamic -- and after you've 
cast it well, trusting the actors, encouraging them in the direction they're 
going." 


And acting? Gray sighed. 


"Often the five minutes that ends up on the screen took three days to shoot, a 
couple of weeks out of your life. It's not terribly satisfying. Not that I 
don't do my damnedest to give a good performance: I try to be dangerous and 
courageous, give the director something he can work with. But usually you're 
just a vehicle for some plot point in the story. So working on the stage is a 
great outlet. If I had my druthers, I'd never act again. Really. I'd make the 
switch in a minute."

TELEVISION REVIEWS ; 


ZIMBALIST, MCCLANAHAN GOOD FIT IN 'BROWN SUIT' 




By LYNNE HEFFLEY 




Agatha Christie's "The Man in the Brown Suit," airing at 9 tonight on Channels 
2 and 4, is missing its '20s British flavor: This early Christie thriller (sans 
Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot) has been Americanized and updated to the 
present. Christie fans don't have to stay away, though. The breezy adaptation 
leaves the prolific mystery writer's twists and turns fairly intact and makes 
for pleasant viewing. 


Directed by Alan Grint, set in Middle Eastern and African locales (actually 
filmed in Madrid, Cadiz and off the coast of Spain), the film is escapist fare 
with an international touch. What makes it most worthwhile, however, is the 
enjoyable cast, particularly Stephanie Zimbalist as Christie's adventure-hungry 
heroine, Anne Beddingfeld. 


Anne, a tourist in Egypt, witnesses a death and sees a "man in a brown suit" 
running from the scene. She finds murder, stolen diamonds and romance when she 
follows a clue to a cruise ship full of upper-crust eccentrics. 


Zimbalist is true to Christie's creation, humorous and feisty, her strong, 
beautiful face fairly aglow with eagerness for adventure and romance. She is 
aided and abetted by Rue McClanahan, who plays bubbly, rich, husband-hunting 
Suzy Blair. McClanahan simply does a variation of her appealing "Golden Girls" 
character, but she and Zimbalist play cozily off each other. 


Edward Woodward, Nickolas Grace and Tony Randall are a kick to watch -- Randall 
appears in several guises -- and Simon Dutton is a highly attractive hero. 
Carla Jean Wagner's script fails primarily in the character of a paunchy, 
balding CIA man named Gordon Race (Ken Howard plays this thankless role). 
Christie's original, who appeared in several books, was the darkly handsome, 
mysteriously saturnine Johnny Race of the Secret Service. LYNNE HEFFLEY

   By FRANK GRAY


IF YOU are running a successful London fashion business but are pushing 50
and thinking about a change, what do you do? Escape to an island, maybe.
That is what Tony and Beatrice Porter did eight years ago when they took the
biggest risk of their adventurous business lives by deciding to snap up a
chunk of near-deserted rock known as Burgh Island off the south Devon coast.
Its sole assets were a near-derelict 1930s hotel, and a shale-and-mortar
pub, the Pilchard Inn, built in 1336
Seven years and several million pounds later, the hotel has been refurbished
to reflect its original art decoratif splendour and has enjoyed a vigorous
trade, thanks to good timing, imaginative entrepreneurship, and the support
of several banks willing to back a long-shot.
The Porters first visited the village of Bigbury-on-Sea on a winter's day in
1985. One sight of the island, despite its parlous state, was enough: they
would become hoteliers. An added fillip, was that the hotel had a history:
Agatha Christie used it as the setting for two of her novels, And Then There
Were None and Evil Under the Sun.
Christie was close friends with the man who built the hotel, Archibald
Nettlefold, founder of what is now GKN. He also owned the Comedy Theatre in
London, which regularly staged Christie whodunnits. The hotel enjoyed
pre-war notoriety as a playground for Christie, Noel Coward, the young Louis
Mountbatten and even Edward and Mrs Simpson.
Ownership had long since passed from Nettlefold's hands; and on December 5
1985 it became the Porters', who bought it outright from Landstone Estates,
a small development company, before it was put up for auction.
The total outlay, including a two-year restoration, ran into millions, Tony
Porter recalled recently. Rewiring, for example, cost Pounds 50,000 and
roofing Pounds 60,000.
The motivation, Porter said, was to take on a new challenge, particularly as
Burgh Island came up for grabs just as his 50th birthday was approaching.
Porter spent most of the 1960s in Nigeria working for ICI; in the 1970s he
and his wife moved into London fashion consultancy.
'We could see that another 10-15 years would slip by with nothing really to
show for them but a pile of scrap books full of press cuttings promoting
other people's clothes,' he said.
Once the decision about Burgh Island was made, the challenge was to persuade
bank managers to go along with the plans, first with the bridging loan that
would allow them to clinch the deal while the sale of their London house
went through; the second to provide the long-term finance to restore the
property.
Help came from Allied Dunbar, which agreed to lend enough money to up the
deal before the auction. Contracts were exchanged on December 4 1985, and
'we completed the deal the following January 6, by which time all these
sales, our property in London and four small properties on the island, were
either completed or set up.'
A South Devon branch of Barclays Bank agreed to finance the refurbishment,
no easy task given the deterioration of the masonry, electrics, heating and
steel fittings, although the structure was sound. Much of the art deco
furniture had been damaged beyond repair or destroyed.
The hotel's self-catering flatlets were kept going while room-by-room
refurbishment got under way. The self-catering was gradually phased out and,
the hotel went back into full-time business on March 12, 1988, complete with
a scene out of a Coward play. 'Our first customers turned up in striped
blazers and beaded dresses, and the ballroom sprang to life with the
charleston and the tango.'
'We were advised that 28 bedrooms would be far more profitable than 14 suits
with their own sitting room,' said Porter, 'but were dedicated to style in
every area, and the suites suited that perfectly.
'Little by little, as we found more period furniture, more experienced staff
and marvellous food, we were able to inch up the tariff to the current level
of Pounds 85 per person per night, including breakfast, dinner, a suit and,
of course, VAT.
To the delight of Porter's bank managers, Burgh Island enjoys an occupancy
rate of 90 per cent in the five-month peak season and around 30 per cent in
the winter. The restaurant operates to a fashionable London standard and
attracts customers on its own. The hotel has a staff of 30 and is open all
year.
Porter acknowledge that it was not always smooth sailing. 'There were a
number of occasions when we worried about the wide gap between expenditures
and income on the project, and this kept us awake from time to time. But
with our occupancy rate now having climbed, we are confident we have turned
the corner. As well, our time and investment has enhanced the value of the
property as a whole.'
'The worst of the financial challenges behind us,' said Porter, 'there is no
reason why we should not persist in trying to create one of the best small
hotels anywhere.'

about page 222 of the book - only 30 pages from the end - that I reckoned I
knew for certain who was the guilty party. Clive Exton's stage version
maintains the suspense just as long; anyone who guesses at the interval will
almost certainly be wrong.
Guessing is what you are intended to do. Murder is Easy is an old-fashioned
thriller without psychological frills. As the adapter of many of the Poirot
stories for television, Exton is a master of the craft. I am inclined to say
that on stage Christie works better, as here, without either a Poirot or a
Miss Marples as the central investigator: just a one off set of people who
happen to be involved in murder.
Exton has re-arranged, simplified and to some extent modernised the original
plot. There is one murder fewer: the figure of Dr Humbleby is missing. This
is a pity because it slightly reduces the number of motives and suspects,
but perhaps the full text would have been too complex for the stage.
Lord Whitfield has become a rather grander press magnate than he seemed in
the book. He owns three national titles and 16 magazines. Played by Nigel
Davenport, he gives instructions to his Fleet street editors down a
megaphone from the village of Wychwood-Under-Ashe. Speaking with a Hampshire
accent, he never seems like Lord Beaverbrook nor even Robert Maxwell, but
maybe in these matters it is sensible not to be too close to life, and it is
part of the technique that nobody is presented as particularly dislikeable:
it makes the guessing all the harder.
Charlotte Attenborough as Bridget, Lord Whitfield's secretary-cum-fiancee,
has become a thoroughly practical modern woman: ready to marry for money
because the marital duties will not be much different from the secretarial,
but vastly better rewarded. No-one would accuse her of base motives. She
looks remarkably attractive and self-confident throughout.
The weakness is perhaps the straight male lead played by Peter Capaldi who
arrives in the village suspecting that murders have taken place and
determined to investigate. Almost inevitably therefore he ceases to be
interesting, for not even by the wildest stretch of imagination could he be
regarded as a suspect. This is not entirely Capaldi's fault, but he could be
a bit more lively.
There are compensations in some of the smaller parts: for example, Jo
Kendall as the cleaning lady with eight children, two of them dead. Ms
Kendall has some wonderful physical movements and plays a splendid scene
with Roger Booth as Major Horton, whose wife has just died. Irene Sutcliffe
as Honoria Waynflete, a well-born village spinster, knows how to create a
frisson when she wants to. There is also some black comedy, notably
concerning what happened to her pet canary.
The sets, designed by Christopher Morley and Christopher Woods, are
ambitious, moving from Lord Whitfield's ostentatiously structured house to
more homely surroundings and to the local downs where strange practices
occur. Sometimes the scene changes are a little slow, as is the general
direction by Wyn Jones. All that can be speeded up. The main thing is to
keep guessing. No-one can guarantee that Murder is Easy will run for 40
years or even 40 months, but no-one predicted that about the Mousetrap
either.

In the 1930s Agatha Christie voluntarily played second fiddle to her
archaeologist husband, Max Mallowan, when she accompanied him to Syria in
his quest for artefacts of the past. At the end of each dig, when the local
workmen had been paid off, Agatha and Max agonised over the division of the
spoils.
One half they could bring back to Britain; the other was claimed by the
French authorities on behalf of Syria's museums. The form was long
established: Agatha and Max divided the shards, ornaments, pieces of
jewellery and small statues into two piles, knowing there would be no
quibbling about the content of each. The French official, advised by his
wife, would scrutinise the piles, point to one and have it removed intact.
The dilemma for Agatha and Max was in the dividing. Whichever pile was
chosen would inevitably be the wrong one. It would contain something they
desperately desired.
Today's visitors to the museum at Aleppo, in northern Syria, can assess for
themselves the French official's judgment. Here are Mallowan's discoveries -
unpainted pots and decorated jars from the 3rd millennium BC, a golden altar
frieze, jewellery of precious stones, gold and silver.
Such is the power and presence of the past in today's Syria that the
comfortable coach for internal travel, and the top-class hotels with the
very best of 20th century facilities, become incidental to the monuments of
a civilisation stretching back to the 10th millennium BC, believed to be the
date of the earliest alphabet, recorded on tablets discovered at Ebla, south
of Aleppo.
In the Roman city of Bosra, 3,000 men, women and children continue to live
with their animals among the basalt ruins. Elsewhere, the city would be
fenced off and tourists charged a fortune to wander its streets. But in
Bosra chickens and turkeys scuttle through the agora and goats survey
visitors from the ramparts of the Arab castle.
Children, hoping for the gift of a pen or a boiled sweet, emerge from the
canvas coverings which act as front doors to their homes among the ruins.
On the street stretching the width of the town, from the Nabataean Gate to
the Gate of the Wind, women and children queue outside the bakery for the
flat Arab bread they carry home piled high on their heads.
Following TE Lawrence's route from Aqaba to Damascus, the signposts point
left to Beirut and right to Baghdad. The abandoned, half-built houses lining
the desert road belong to the Bedouin semi-nomads, who construct frames of
stone and wood and fling canvas over to make the roof and walls.
The families had moved on, taking their canvas with them to the next
semi-structure on their route. Eventually they would return. Further on, the
true Bedouin in their canvas tents signalled that in exchange for cigarettes
we could take their photographs.
At Palmyra, a man sat cross-legged on a hillside looking down on the ruins
of the 2nd century city still known by locals as Tadmor (city of dates).
Around him his sheep gazed, too, at us and at the temple columns, the
monumental arch, the remains of the bath house and the rows of seating
leading down to the orchestra of a theatre whose white stone turned pink in
the setting sun.
An oasis in the Syrian Desert, mentioned in tablets as early as the 19th
century BC, Palmyra is there for us still, to clamber over, photograph and
savour. Its guardians regard it without awe. Our coach - the only one on the
vast site - raised dust and stones as it left the track and headed through
the ruins to the entrance of the hypogeum; in the museum the curator invited
us to touch the exhibits, to prove that the statue was of a blind man whose
eyes definitely lacked pupils.
Part of the Roman road which once stretched from Antioch to Aleppo remains,
and the desire to step on it is irresistible. From nowhere appear small
children, clutching gifts of wild flowers: purple and red poppies which
flourish in the cracks between the blocks of stone. The blocks had been cut
about a metre square by the Romans or their slaves and placed side by side
on top of the desert scrub. Amazingly, the road is not straight.
Olives grow in abundance, along with almonds and pistachios. But it is the
olive and its oil which are special to the Syrians who, for 5,000 years,
have understood its worth as a foodstuff and its usefulness - when boiled -
for keeping enemies at bay.
The guide at the Crac des Chevaliers pointed with delight to the many nooks
and crannies from where boiling olive oil was dropped on intruders by the
Crusader knights, intent on controlling trade from the ports to the Syrian
interior.
The Crac, dramatic in its domination of the only gap in a 250km mountain
range stretching from Antakya in Turkey to Beirut, housed a garrison of
4,000 when the Crusaders built it in 1150. It is extremely well preserved
and, apart from later additions in Frankish and Arabic styles, would
probably be recognised today by one of the 4,000.
Saint Simeon's monument to excessive piety, the pillar on which he lived,
ate (once a week only, and then sparingly) and slept for 40 years, is
crumbled and shortened by time, set among the ruins of the serene and
beautiful Monastery of St Sergius and Bachus - a place in which to linger
and not to ponder on how a man copes with the practicalities of living 13m
above the earth, perched in the open on a pillar at best 1m square.
In the old city at Damascus a young man approached and invited us to tea in
a cafe where, he promised, a story-teller was due to read tales from One
Thousand and One Nights.
Inside, a large man wearing a gold turban and braided jacket sat on a high
chair reading from an ancient parchment. The audience - all men, apart from
me - listened intently, smoking their hookahs and drinking tea from small
glasses.
With no knowledge of Arabic, we were caught by the atmosphere as the
story-teller's face, arms and voice dramatised events.
The souks at Aleppo and Damascus cater for modern-day shoppers. Merchants of
silk, silver, gold and semi-precious stones tempt you to their stands with
offers of tea and a sit-down. Mostly, they want to practise their English
and discuss the fortunes of Manchester United. Bartering is expected and
one-third off the asking price is the usual compromise.
Confronted with the present, it was hard to ignore the missiles on the
border roads as we drove parallel with the Israeli border from Jordan into
Syria, and we noticed that our guide preferred questions about the ancient
world rather than the modern.
Flying in at night on a Royal Jordanian aircraft, it was impossible to
distinguish the lights of Aqaba from those of Eilat. The irony was not lost
on us. Throughout the flight the route had been displayed in the cabin,
using a map on which Israel did not exist.

MR ASIL Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, has successfully intervened
in the Turkish courts to prevent the sale of Gunaydin, the Istanbul
newspaper, in his latest move to regain control of his Turkish assets.
On Thursday an Istanbul court postponed the sale by the official receivers
of Gunaydin, pending settlement of dispute over ownership of the newspaper's
title.
The former Polly Peck chairman, who jumped bail in the UK earlier this month
and fled to northern Cyprus, has said he will fight to regain his assets in
Turkey.
Gunaydin's staff, owed more than TL60bn by Mr Nadir, created a new company
called Yeni Gunaydin last year, printing on machinery auctioned by the state
receivers.
Imar bank, the newspaper's creditors, unsuccessfully challenged the move in
the courts.
This week Mr Osman Adas, acting for Mr Nadir, claimed the Gunaydin title was
vested in Veb Holding, a private company, which according to Turkish
Treasury records is 100 per cent owned by Mr Nadir.
Mr Nadir's action has blocked the sale of Gunaydin to Mr Mustafa Suzer, a
businessman of Kurdish origin and owner of the Pera Palas Hotel,
immortalised by the writer Agatha Christie.

The chaps in ITV who succumbed to the feminist demagogues in the 80s and
took Benny Hill off the air because he was 'sexist' must have felt a little
silly come the 90s and Hill's growing international esteem. He is now seen
in the US and much of Europe as one of the world's great clowns, so ITV is
quietly slipping him back on the air. The Benny Hill Show (8.30) is the
first in a new series of 'compilations from past shows' . . . well, yes,
repeats, but it is one step towards sanity, and no doubt the ratings will be
enormous.
C4's arts magazine, Without Walls (9.00), offers a promising two-part
programme. Michael Dibdin goes for Agatha Christie in the 'J'accuse' slot,
claiming that she perverted the form of the British crime novel, and in
'Reel Secrets' the qualities of horror movies are discussed by Robert McKee.
Last week the BAFTA award for best arts programme went to this series for
McKee's excellent piece on 'Citizen Kane'.
BBC1 starts a new drama series called Resnick: Lonely Hearts (10.00) which,
we are promised, is all about police detectives. Where do the broadcasters
get these astoundingly fresh ideas?

At 9.30 BBC1 begins five hours of American movies with Rain Man, the 1988
film which won Oscars for best film, best original screenplay and best
direction. Some may think it does not seem that good: a rather static road
movie in which a car dealer discovers that his autistic brother has a gift
for memorising numbers. Moreover the BBC, as is now its habit, has censored
it, so that no serious film enthusiast will want to see it.
April Fool's Day, which follows (11.45), sounds like a latterday American
version of the Agatha Christie classic 'Ten Little Niggers'. The invitations
to the sinister house on the island are the same, and although there are
eight guests instead of 10 the general idea is remarkably similar.
Cat's Eye (1.10am) is categorised as a horror movie, though it is a trio of
Stephen King stories which, by modern standards, are pretty mild.
Casual Sex? (BBC2, 11.45), yet another movie, was made five years ago and is
very much in the modern mould: feminist, post-Aids attitudes to sex from two
women who visit a health spa looking for romance

edge off his best vicious lines. The preludial music - 'I Did It My Way' on
crematorium-organ - is nice, but the bundled cadaver of Hal's Mum is
ridiculously large and lightweight.
Miss Molloy allows herself too much Irish crooning, melodious lubrication of
lines that want scarifying down-to-earth candour. Colin Hurley captures
Hal's pal Dennis, the criminal undertaker's-assistant, with cooler
precision, though he is a bit over-age: it matters to the play that the
appalling Hal and Dennis are just streetwise adolescents. Nobody but Patrick
O'Connell's widowed McLeavy, baffled and beset, should speak with unguarded
feeling; O'Connell does that very well, but the improper competition - from
Hal and from Nurse Fay, and even from the egregious Truscott of the Yard -
denies him his proper effect. When his last unjust deserts should jolt us
beyond the provisional limits of the farce, they melt painlessly into the
general charade.
Inspector Truscott is the key role, and David Troughton plays him with
resourceful relish: not a line wasted nor an implication missed, the
transition from simple Agatha Christie bumbler to corrupt modern archetype
smoothly managed. Yet Troughton's basic comic persona gets in the way. He is
always vainly ingratiating, a hopeful wheedler, where the original West End
Truscott (Michael Bates, much missed) went through virtuoso switches from
flat Christie stereotype to sudden sadist - here, Troughton's duffing-up of
Hal carries nothing like the shock-value - to venal bribee. That made Loot
much nastier, and significantly funnier.

INNS, HOTELS, B&amp;BS IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST 




By STEPHANIE IRVING, Irving is co-author of Northwest Best Places 1990-1991, 
(Sasquatch Books, Seattle,$15.95). 




The Pacific Northwest is a natural delicacy with rocky coastlines, verdant 
mountains and fertile farmlands. At times its exterior can appear gray, its 
climate sober, its waters chilled and its mountains temperamental. But at other 
moments it is warm and sunny and frosted with wildflowers under constantly 
changing skies and crystal-clear air. 


There are many wonderful places to stay. The inns, hotels and bed and 
breakfasts that follow are a few of its treasures. 


April Point Lodge: P.O. Box 1, Campbell River, B.C. V9W 4Z9, Canada (about 100 
miles north of Vancouver on Quadra Island), (604) 285-2222; double rooms start 
at $99 a night. This is not roughing it. April Point Lodge is perhaps the 
finest fishing lodge in the Northwest and not just because the knowledge the 
fishing guides have is based on generations of experience. Cabins are 
attractive, with large fireplaces, and food is outstanding. You must fly or 
take a ferry in. 


Columbia Gorge Hotel: 4000 Westcliff Drive, Hood River, Ore. 97031 (about an 
hour east of Portland), (503) 386-5566 or (800) 345-1921; double rooms start at 
$135 a night. On a cliff overlooking Columbia Gorge, just above where hundreds 
of windsurfers zip back and forth across the river. If you're going to stay in 
this handsome hotel, a gorge-side room is a must (otherwise you may find 
yourself overlooking and overhearing Interstate 84). A seven-course breakfast 
comes with an overnight room. It's so big it's frightening. 


Four Seasons Olympic Hotel: 411 University St., Seattle, Wash. 98101 
(downtown), (206) 621-1700 or (800) 223-8772; double rooms start at $190 a 
night. Seattle's most elegant hotel, it's not as luxurious as you might expect, 
but refreshingly simple. The service is gracious and the hotel exhibits 
four-star touches. 


Hastings House: P.O. Box 1110, Ganges, B.C. VOS 1EO, Canada (halfway between 
Vancouver and Victoria in the Gulf Islands), (604) 537-2362; double rooms start 
at about $200 a night, including breakfast and afternoon tea. A remarkable 
place in part due to the surroundings amid fruit trees, gardens and rolling 
lawns that overlook a peaceful cove on Salt Spring Island. A dozen suites in 
four renovated farm buildings. Our favorite is the Hayloft with its bay window 
seat, Franklin stove and folk art. The service is especially prompt and 
efficient. 


The Heathman Hotel: 1009 S.W. Broadway, Portland, Ore. 97205 (downtown), (503) 
241-4100 or (800) 551-0011; double rooms start at $125 a night. The place to 
stay in Portland, it has afternoon tea each day, an exquisite marble bar for 
the evening, elegant rooms and one of Portland's finest restaurants. You feel 
well taken care of but not fussed over. 


The James House: 1238 Washington St., Port Townsend, Wash. 98368 (about 50 
miles northwest of Seattle); (206) 385-1238; double rooms start at $60 a night. 
Among the Northwest's first B&amp;Bs and Port Townsend's finest Victorian home. 
James House has about a dozen antique decorator rooms, though the best ones 
face Puget Sound. The main floor has two beautiful parlors, each with a 
fireplace. 


Mattey House Inn: 10221 N.E. Mattey Lane, McMinnville, Ore. 97128 (35 miles 
southwest of Portland), (503) 434-5058; double rooms start at $55 a night, 
including breakfast. The Mattey House stands behind its own little vineyard, 
like a remote French manor. It's an 1890s Victorian mansion. It has nice extra 
touches such as fresh flowers, plush bathrobes and, appropriately, a glass of 
wine in the parlor. The hosts are enthusiastic guides to the Willamette Valley 
wine country. 


Mazama Country Inn: P.O. Box 223, Mazama, Wash. 98833 (185 miles northeast of 
Seattle), (509) 996-2681; double rooms start at $58 a night. A spacious lodge 
in the middle of pristine Methow Valley, where in the winter guests 
cross-country ski over the 100 miles of groomed trails. In the summer they 
explore the valley on horseback. The original inn was a converted farmhouse but 
the new cedar building has a bit more charm. It's rural without being rustic. 
Dining is family style. 


Paradise Ranch Inn: 7000-D Monument Drive, Grants Pass, Ore. 97526 (about 200 
miles south of Portland, about 61 miles north of the California border), (503) 
479-4333; double rooms start at $83 a night. Imagine a working dude ranch 
turned into a Northwest resort. That's exactly what you'll find here, with 
activities ranging from trout fishing to tennis, swimming in a heated outdoor 
pool to hiking. But best of all, it's not a sprawling resort. Having only 18 
rooms makes it very peaceful. 


Sylvia Beach Hotel: 267 N.W. Cliff, Newport, Ore. 97365 (about 114 miles 
southwest of Portland); (503) 265-5428; double rooms start at $50 a night. In 
this informal bluff-top hotel for bookworms, each of the 20 rooms is decorated 
in a different literary theme. For instance, the Agatha Christie room is in 
green English chintz with a tiled fireplace and items that served as clues in 
Christie mysteries. The best part of the hotel is the library on the third 
floor that has a fireplace, lots of comfortable chairs and a wide-open view of 
the Pacific. 


Tyax Mountain Lake Resort: Tyaughton Lake Road, Gold Bridge, B.C. VOK 1PO, 
Canada (about 110 miles north of Vancouver), (604) 238-2221; double rooms start 
at $98 a night. This place defines indulgence for the active minded. The best 
way to get here is by float plane. It's right by a lake, though the key to fun 
here is "heli" anything: heli-skiing, heli-hiking, even heli-fossil hunting. 
You can stay in the large log lodge but if you arrive with a group try to 
reserve one of the three chalets on Tyaughton Lake. 


The Willows: 2579 West Shore Drive, Lummi Island, Wash. 98262 (about 100 miles 
north of Seattle), (206) 758-2620; double rooms start at $90 a night. On 
pastoral Lummi Island, the Willows has only four rooms but all are very 
comfortable. 


However, it's the Saturday night dinner, really a feast, that has won such a 
following among locals. It begins at sunset on the porch to the accompanyment 
of a harpist and guitarist and finishes five courses later in the sitting room 
with a civilized glass of port. Dinner cost is $75. Reservations are required.

 WINE NOTES: TWO MAJOR AUCTIONS SET FOR LOS ANGELES 




By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 




Two major wine auctions are scheduled for Los Angeles later this year, and one 
of them is the first of a series of wine auctions on the West Coast by the 
English auction house of Christie, Manson &amp; Woods International Inc. 


The Christie auction will be held at the Bel Age Hotel on Saturday, Sept. 23, 
with Christie's chief auctioneer, J. Michael Broadbent, at the podium. 
Broadbent has long headed Christie's Wine Inc., the division of the firm that 
stages regular auctions in London. Broadbent was the "voice" of the first six 
Napa Valley Wine Auctions. 


An announcement by Christie's said that the Los Angeles auction is the first of 
"what we hope to be a regular series of (wine) auctions on the West Coast." 


The second major auction announced for Los Angeles is to benefit the American 
Institute of Food and Wine. It is scheduled for Nov. 18 at the Four Seasons 
Hotel. A major wine-tasting event sponsored by the Meritage Society will be 
conducted prior to the auction. 


The auction is backed by a large committee of Southern California wine 
collectors. Dennis Foley, who is associated with the San Francisco auction 
house of Butterfield and Butterfield, will be auctioneer. 


For details on the Christie auction, write to Christie's, 200 W. Superior St., 
Chicago, Ill. 60610. For details on the auction, write to AIWF, 1550 Bryant 
Street, San Francisco 94103. 


Bob Thompson, wine author for two decades, has been selected to receive the 
Excellence in Wine Writing Award from Wines &amp; Vines Magazine for 1989. 


Thompson, longtime editor with Sunset magazine, has written 24 books, many of 
them about wine, and writes a wine column for the San Francisco Examiner. 


Thompson, who lives in the Napa Valley with his wife, is also one of the 
nation's most respected wine competition judges. 


Michael Cliff has stepped down as chief executive officer of Vintners 
International, and Paul Schlem, chairman, has assumed the position. Cliff 
remains president and a stockholder. Vintners International owns Paul Masson 
and other brands in California, Taylor/Great Western and other brands in New 
York, and imports wine from overseas.

the Brontes, Browning, Chaucer, D H Lawrence and so on down to Yeats - who
might be counted as British for at least the earlier part of his life.
According to Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Centre for
International Exchange, the list shows Japanese intellectuals' awareness of
Britain's literary and artistic heritage. By contrast, he told the UK-Japan
2000 Group's latest meeting, 'there are very few scholars or experts in
Japan well versed in the current political dynamics of the UK or its policy
process'.
The group hopes to put that right by promoting educational exchanges between
the two countries. When its members met Prime Minister Major, however, his
special concern seemed to be to spread knowledge of cricket - and not only
to the East. Thanks to the Japan Festival, he said, there were now thousands
of British schoolchildren who knew more about sumo wrestling than about
their own national summer game.

WHEN YEARS, NOT DOLLARS, COUNT FOR SUCCESS IN THE THEATER; 


STAGE DOOR IN AGOURA SURVIVES BY PRESENTING MAINSTREAM FARE 




By DINA ADLER, Adler is a Westlake Village free-lance writer. 




How do you measure the success of an Equity waiver theater? According to Gale 
Trumbeaux, the executive producer of the Stage Door Theatre in Agoura, 
longevity -- rather than profitability -- is the answer. 


"In the eight years we've been in operation, many little theaters in Los 
Angeles and the Valley have closed their doors," said Trumbeaux, 50. But the 
49-seat Stage Door continues to survive by offering mainstream fare, such as 
Neil Simon and Agatha Christie. "Wait Until Dark" and "Deathtrap," and Simon's 
"Chapter Two" and "Same Time Next Year" have been among its most successful 
productions. 


The theater has been closed for minor repairs since mid-December, but Trumbeaux 
plans to reopen the Stage Door tomorrow with Noel Coward's "Private Lives," in 
which she will star. 


Trumbeaux's introduction to show business came at age 17 with her marriage to 
Fred Astaire II. "I spent 7 years living in the Fred Astaire household" in 
Beverly Hills, she said, "and I absorbed a strong feeling for show business 
through my surroundings." She added, "We had an elegant life, including 
servants and travel and lots of visiting royalty -- both the real and the 
Hollywood variety." 


When the marriage ended, Trumbeaux found herself a "Cinderella in reverse." "I 
didn't get a penny in alimony or child support," she said, "although I do have 
some wonderful furnishings and silverware which the Astaires were kind enough 
to give me." 


When a second marriage ended, Trumbeaux moved with her two sons -- one from 
each marriage -- from Northridge to Agoura Hills. Although she had no business 
or theater experience, Trumbeaux persuaded a friend who was an actor to open 
the Firelite Dinner Theater in Ventura. From 1969 to 1979, Trumbeaux drove from 
her home in Agoura to Ventura, gaining experience in acting and directing. 
Finally, tired of the drive, she decided to look for something closer to home. 


"For years I had been aware of an old building located at the corner of Agoura 
Road and Lewis Street," Trumbeaux said. "It was a momma-papa market and gas 
station at one time but had been vacant for years. The owner thought I was 
crazy to try to put a theater in there, so I had to act a lot more confident 
about it than I felt." 


Trumbeaux rented the space, borrowed $5,000 from her parents and transformed 
the 1920s-era general store into a small theater with a 9-by-13 foot stage. She 
purchased seats from the Shrine Auditorium for $5 apiece and, in November, 
1980, opened with Simon's "Plaza Suite." 


No one associated with the theater is paid, but Trumbeaux has a file of actors, 
directors and technicians who are available to help her meet her goal of 
mounting a production every 6 to 8 weeks. Occasionally she tries to branch out 
and stage some not-so-traditional productions. 


"We tried to mount some Tennessee Williams plays a few years ago and they 
bombed," she said. But "I'm going to try 'Death of a Salesman' as a favor to an 
actor friend in March. I can afford to take a chance like that every few 
years." 


Dave Shelley, the "actor friend" who will play Willie Loman in the Arthur 
Miller play, is a 28-year veteran of theater and television. He recently 
completed a television pilot (with Howie Mandel) titled "Past Imperfect," 
played a police sergeant in the TV series "Crazy Like a Fox" and a teacher in 
the syndicated series "Fame." He played Loman several years ago in an 
off-Broadway production. 


"For me, the Stage Door Theatre is like a gym," said Shelley, who has acted in 
and directed many of the local productions. "It helps me keep my acting muscles 
in shape." 


After many years of commuting to Los Angeles, Karen Machon, an actress with a 
2-year-old son who lives in Agoura Hills, became a part of the Stage Door 
Theatre's "repertory group" to "keep my skills honed." She, too, has appeared 
regularly in series television -- she starred with Dennis Weaver in "Stone" and 
made guest appearances on such TV dramas as "Police Story" and "Columbo." 


"Gale has virtually no ego," Machon said. "Unlike others in this business, she 
provides an ideal atmosphere for actors to flourish creatively." 


"Gale's no prima donna," said Marc Alaimo, a television and movie actor who 
recently appeared in "Educating Rita" at the Stage Door. "She vacuums, cleans 
the bathrooms and books the cast and crew of every play. She also begs, borrows 
or steals the props and scenery." 


The Stage Door is also a place where relatively inexperienced actors and 
directors can gain experience. Julie Silver, a 27-year-old graduate of UCLA's 
Theater Arts Department, works full time as a draftsman and will direct the 
Stage Door's production of "Death of a Salesman." 


"It's scary, but I'm doing my research. I've worked with Gale and Dave Shelley 
before so I'm looking forward to the chance," Silver said. And, she added, she 
enjoys working without the pressures imposed by a professional theater. 


Trumbeaux says she "ekes out a living" through her work at the Stage Door. "I 
pay the rent -- for both the theater and my home -- and put food on the table" 
from the proceeds at the box office. "But I live very simply," she added. "I've 
owned my house for more than 20 years so my payments are small. I don't have 
any charge accounts. I have no medical or life insurance. It's not a life style 
most people would want, but it suits me because I'm doing what I want to do."

CRITIC AT LARGE: MYSTERY WRITERS FIND READERS STILL ENTHUSED AT CRIME'S WAYS; 


AWARDS: ORGANIZATION PRESENTS ITS EDGARS TO A WIDE RANGE OF WORKS, INCLUDING A 
MUSICAL. AND NEW WOMEN WRITERS EXPAND THE RANKS OF PUZZLE MAKERS. 




By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 




NEW YORK 




The Mystery Writers of America, formed in 1945, is the senior organization of 
crime writers in this country. Its annual Edgar awards (named, of course, for 
Edgar Allan Poe, who is generally saluted as the founding father of the form) 
are the most prestigious in the field. 


The 1990 awards, presented at a formal banquet last week at the start of a 
three-day ingathering of mystery authors, editors and publishers, confirmed the 
range of work that falls under the umbrella of "mystery," from a Broadway 
musical to traditional puzzles and hard-edged works heavy on social realism 
rather than arsenic at the vicarage. The prevailing tone was a cheerful feeling 
that the public's appetite for mystery in all its guises is healthy. 


The evidence includes the frequent appearance of mystery writers on the 
best-seller lists: P. D. James, Ruth Rendell, Tony Hillerman, Mary Higgins 
Clark, Dick Francis, Joseph Wambaugh and others whose works are technically 
thrillers rather than mysteries. 


The ongoing popularity of "Murder, She Wrote" and the "Mystery" series on PBS 
is also heartening to the mystery trade. The committee that chose the Edgar for 
best mystery motion picture deliberated among 51 titles (some candidates 
indubitably far-fetched). The numbers in other categories were equally 
impressive: 75 candidates for best first mystery novel, 220 entries for best 
novel, 60 young adult mysteries, more than 600 short stories. 


The Edgar for best novel went to James Lee Burke for his "Black Cherry Blues," 
set partly in Louisiana, where Burke has lived, and partly in Montana, where 
Burke now lives. It features his series character, a former New Orleans cop 
named Dave Robicheaux, who first appeared in "The Neon Rain." 


Burke, a one-time Los Angeles Skid Row social worker, writes with poetic 
intensity about a very real and often ugly world. His stories develop a double 
suspense because Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic whose struggles to stay 
dry despite the tensions and frustrations of the case at hand are painful but 
heartening. 


Burke has also written four non-mystery novels and his short stories have 
appeared in the Kenyon Review and other literary journals. His work reflects 
one strain of present mystery writing, toughly realistic but compassionate, 
entertaining in the hard-edge tradition but qualifying as a work of social 
history. 


Men outnumbered women among the winners, yet it seems significant that three of 
the five nominees for best first mystery novel were women, including Los 
Angeles' Melodie Johnson Howe, a former Universal contract player whose "The 
Mother Shadow" was very well reviewed. The winner was "The Last Billable Hour" 
by Susan Wolfe. 


If there is a significant trend in the mystery field, it is the increasing 
frequency and popularity of mysteries by women, with women as protagonists, 
like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, taking over Ross Macdonald's Santa Barbara 
beat, and Sara Peretsky's V. I. Warshawski, finding crime and social problems 
going hand in hand in Chicago. 


Recent surveys have suggested that perhaps one published mystery in four is 
written by a woman. Yet the ratio seems deceptive, probably because women 
historically and today have been disproportionately successful in the field, 
from the days of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery 
Allingham in England, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Mignon Eberhart and several others 
in this country. 


This is Christie's centenary year -- she was born in 1890 and died in 1976 -- 
and there will be elaborate observances in England and elsewhere. Her 84 books 
continue to sell in innumerable languages and to find new audiences. 


Christie's grandson, Matthew Pritchard, who oversees the ongoing sales and 
productions of her work, was an honored guest at the awards banquet and at a 
90-minute seminar Saturday on the durability of Christie's work. 


She was, the panelists agreed, an unparalleled puzzle maker, especially 
ingenious at diverting the reader's eye from the culprit yet making the 
ultimate revelation inevitable rather than arbitrary. As one of the panelists 
said, the reader's reaction is most often: "Fooled again, but fairly." 


It is a kind of conjuring trick, and Pritchard noted that his grandmother was 
fascinated by magic tricks and in fact briefly employed a butler whose gifts 
included performing magic. 


The question often asked at gatherings of mystery writers and readers is why 
the form should have such a continuing and evidently growing popularity. Prof. 
B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, an expert on P. D. James, Ruth Rendell and other 
English writers, thinks that the charm of the mystery is that restores order 
after chaos, in a world that sometimes appears increasingly chaotic. It also 
metes out justice in a world where justice is not always seen to be done. 


The traditional puzzle mystery was escapist fare, ideal for train rides, 
hammocks and sleepless nights. Yet even the escapist fare, Rahn says, reflected 
its times. Christie's characters, said Mary Higgins Clark, who chaired the 
seminar, were not stereotypes but prototypes, and they reveal the times 
Christie lived in and the places she knew, from English villages to 
archeological digs where she spent a month each summer with her husband Max 
Mallowan. 


What Edgar Allan Poe began, Arthur Conan Doyle and Christie made a worldwide 
industry. 


The other Edgar winners included Jack Olsen's "Doc: The Rape of the Town of 
Lowell," as best fact crime book. Norman Sherry's "The Life of Graham Green, 
Volume I: 1904-1939" was the best critical or biographical study. The Larry 
Gelbart/Cy Coleman/David Zippel musical "City of Angels," won an Edgar as best 
mystery play. (It was also the only nomination.) 


Keith Peterson's "The Rain" was chosen the best paperback original mystery. 
Surprisingly, the Edgar for best motion picture went to "Heathers," a blackish, 
brackish comedy thriller about murderous and suicidal games among high 
schoolers. The runners-up were Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Sea of 
Love," "True Believer" and "Licence to Kill," the most recent James Bond. 


A special Raven award went to Carol Brener, for her tenure as owner of the 
pioneering Manhattan mystery book shop, Murder, Ink. 


The Mystery Writer's Grand Master award for an entire body of work went this 
year to Helen McCloy, now 86, who published her first mystery in 1938.

A POET ON THE PROWL; 


DEVICES AND DESIRES BY P.D. JAMES (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 435 PP.) 




By Charles Champlin 




Phyllis Dorothy White James can now safely be called the pre-eminent English 
writer of mysteries. "Devices and Desires" is a main selection of the 
Book-of-the-Month Club, as was her previous book, "A Taste for Death." It will 
have a first cloth printing of 175,000 and a Quality Paperback Book Club 
edition to follow. 


Her books, like those of John Le Carre there and Tony Hillerman and Elmore 
Leonard here, have slipped the comfortable bonds of genre to reach far wider 
audiences, helped by the television dramatizations of some of her earlier books 
such as "Death of an Expert Witness." 


She is not the heiress-apparent to Dame Agatha Christie and reportedly does not 
enjoy being thought such. Christie's ingeniously improbable plottings are not 
James' forte, and commercially, Christie, the reprint rights to whose works 
changed hands a couple of years ago for $92 million, remains in a class by 
herself. 


James is her own voice, creating her own tradition. Her writing does have 
echoes of a longer, Victorian tradition: the spacious novel with its loving 
attention to environments and atmospheres, the delineation of character (which 
Christie tended to skim over with telegraphic speed) and the conveying of 
nuance in relationships and moments. "Devices and Desires" is a comfortably 
spacious 424 pages long, as tidy and well-furnished as a Victorian parlor. 


Her continuing protagonist, the poet-detective Adam Dalgliesh, a sensitive 
loner touched with sadness, has brought out a new, slim volume of verse and, 
resisting his publisher's desire to push it like a candy bar, has retreated to 
the Norfolk coast to compose his soul in a converted windmill he has inherited, 
with a sizable sum of money, from a beloved, bird-watching aunt. 


James' descriptions of the Norfolk coastline in its remote, spare beauty, quite 
unlike the overdeveloped littoral elsewhere, appears to be born of close 
familiarity and abiding love. It is lovely to read about. 


Dalgliesh's only chore is to deliver proofs of a cookbook to its local author. 
It is enough to embroil him reluctantly in the local scene. The author is the 
sister of a man who directs a nuclear-power station near the sea. The station 
is under a publicity assault generated by an earnest, penniless young man who 
lives nearby and is sheltering a homeless mother and child. 


A serial killer of young women, whom the media has named the Whistler, is 
stalking the vicinity (James is very good at evoking the horror of the 
confrontations) and Dalgliesh is sought out by a former London colleague who 
now heads the local CID and who regards Dalgliesh with a mixture of respect and 
scarcely muted resentment. (James is very, very good at the shoals and 
cross-currents of relationships.) 


The large dramatis personae includes the director's ambitious assistant, whom 
he is attempting to phase out as his mistress, too; a retired clergyman, his 
wife and the nice young woman who looks out for them; a free-spirited painter 
attempting, with the help of a beguiling and precocious daughter, to care for 
his motherless brood; and various boffins and stenos from the power-plant 
staff. 


The director's assistant is murdered, seemingly the latest victim of the 
Whistler. But it turns out that the Whistler had been nabbed not long before 
the killing, and a key question is: Who knew, Who didn't? Even Dalgliesh is at 
least briefly a suspect; the victim was found at the shore, not far from the 
windmill. ("I suspect everyone . . . and no one," a sleuth once remarked.) 


As Greyhound used to say, getting there (in this case to the solution) is half 
the fun. In "Designs and Desires," as in many mysteries, it is substantially 
more than half the fun. It is an irony particularly applicable to James that 
the more extensive the scene-settings and the more (Henry) Jamesian the 
characterizations, the more rickety and anti-climactic the denouement can seem. 


The detecting of who did in the assistant is intricate and professional, and 
although it mounts to what used to be called a sock finish (and fiery as well), 
it also feels oddly perfunctory, like a grand opera built around a visit to 
Disneyland. 


As if she were aware that the atmospheres (even the evidence of careful 
research about the perils and controversies attending nuclear power) were not 
enough, James has attached a subplot, involving a pair of minor-league 
terrorists at the plant, that is arbitrary and owes more to the work of 
Alistair MacLean, say, than to her own sensitive interpretations of present 
society. 


She is not a poet of the abnormal, like her nearest rival, Ruth Rendell, who 
peers into the darkest recesses of the aberrant psyche as no one else does. But 
James is in her own right a poet of, perhaps, more universal men and women and 
especially those whose lives are touched with crime and death. 


This is James on Terry Rickards, Dalgliesh's touchy colleague: "Dalgliesh 
thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still 
not rare; the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination 
and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the 
world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its 
perpetrators unfortunate." 


This is Dalgliesh -- on the same page; Rickards' wife is expecting momentarily 
-- remembering his wife and son who died at childbirth: "His memory of her, 
which for years, a traitor to grief and their love, he had resolutely tried to 
suppress because the pain had seemed unbearable, had gradually been replaced by 
a boyish, romantic dream of gentleness and beauty now fixed forever beyond the 
depredation of time. His newborn son's face he could still recall vividly and 
sometimes did in his dreams, that white unsullied look of sweet, knowledgeable 
contentment, as if, in a brief moment of life, he had seen and known all there 
was to know, seen it and rejected it." 


Passages of such eloquence and sensitivity are not frequently come upon in 
fiction anywhere, and they have earned James her rightful pre-eminence. In 
context, they suggest that crime fiction as such has no limits, only 
limitations.
