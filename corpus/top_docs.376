   Today is Thursday, Aug. 24, the 236th day of 1989. There are 129
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Aug. 24, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union
signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, each country pledging not to
``associate itself with any other grouping of powers which directly
or indirectly is aimed at the other party.''
   On this date:
   In A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the
Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic ash. An
estimated 20,000 people died.
   In A.D. 410, Rome was overrun by the Visigoths, an event that
symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
   In 1572, the slaughter of French Protestants at the hands of
Catholics began in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The killings
lasted until October, and claimed some 13,000 victims.
   In 1814, British forces invaded Washington, D.C., and proceeded
to set fire to the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a
non-stop flight across the United States, traveling from Los
Angeles to Newark, N.J., in just over 19 hours.
   In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty went into effect, with the
parties agreeing that an armed attack against one would be
considered ``an attack against them all.''
   In 1954, the Communist Control Act went into effect, virtually
outlawing the Communist Party in the United States.
   In 1959, three days after Hawaiian statehood, Hiram L. Fong was
sworn in as the first Chinese-American U.S. senator while Daniel K.
Inouye was sworn in as the first Japanese-American in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
   In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power as
it exploded a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific.
   In 1970, a bomb planted by anti-war extremists exploded at the
University of Wisconsin's Army Math Research Center in Madison,
killing 33-year-old researcher Robert Fassnacht.
   In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20
years to life in prison for the shooting death of rock star John
Lennon.
   In 1982, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin was installed as head of
Chicago's Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   Ten years ago: A 73-hour stand-off began at New York's Kennedy
International Airport as U.S. officials prevented the takeoff of an
Aeroflot jetliner until they could determine whether Soviet
ballerina Lyudmila Vlasova was returning home voluntarily after the
defection to the United States of her husband, dancer Alexander
Godunov. (Vlasova was ultimately allowed to leave.)
   Five years ago: On the heels of the Republican convention,
Democrat Walter F. Mondale said the proceedings had demonstrated
that President Ronald Reagan represented the party of the rich,
while Reagan questioned Mondale's commitment to a strong defense.
   One year ago: Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
picked up the endorsement of the AFL-CIO while Republican nominee
George Bush campaigned in California with President Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: TV personality Durward Kirby is 77. TV host
Dennis James is 72. Former secretary of education Shirley
Hufstedler is 64. Boxer Gerry Cooney is 33. Actor Steve Guttenberg
is 31. All-star shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. is 29.
   Thought for today: ``Posterity is as likely to be wrong as
anybody else.'' _Heywood Broun, American journalist and author
(1888-1939).

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
resident of each home who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that
theoretically the results would be within 3 percentage points of
the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the
same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points for Republicans, for example, and nine points for
respondents who have done postgraduate work.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. Do you think the president of the United States and the
leader of the Soviet Union should meet at regular intervals even
without any major items on the agenda, or should they meet only to
complete major treaties?
   Regular intervals: 78 percent. Major treaties: 16 percent. Don't
know or no answer: 6 percent.
   2. The United States and the Soviets recently agreed on a treaty
to abolish each country's medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Do you think that will increase the chance of non-nuclear war in
Europe, decrease the chance of non-nuclear war in Europe, or won't
it make much of a difference?
   Increase: 11 percent. Decrease: 26 percent. Not much difference:
55 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   3. Do you support or oppose the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
each country's medium-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know, no answer:
12 percent.
   4. Would you support or oppose a U.S.-Soviet treaty to abolish
50 percent of each country's long-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 12 percent.
   5. If the United States and the Soviet Union abolished all their
nuclear weapons, do you think that would increase the chance of
non-nuclear war, decrease it, or wouldn't it make much of a
difference?
   Increase, 22 percent. Decrease, 30 percent. Not much difference,
40 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   6. Ronald Reagan has proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as Star Wars, as a missile defense system. Do you think the
United States should drop SDI in exchange for a Soviet agreement to
a big cut in nuclear weapons?
   Yes, 33 percent. No, 49 percent. Don't know or no answer, 18
percent.
   7. Without an arms agreement with the Soviets, do you think work
on SDI should proceed as it is now, or should it be increased, or
reduced, or dropped?
   Proceed as now, 37 percent. Increase, 19 percent. Reduce, 13
percent. Drop, 17 percent. Don't know or no answer, 14 percent.
   8. Which country do you think has more political influence in
the world right now _ the United States, or the Soviet Union, or
are they about equal?
   United States, 41 percent. Soviet Union, 14 percent. About
equal, 38 percent. Don't know or no answer, 7 percent.
   9. Which country do you think is stronger militarily right now _
the United States, or the Soviet Union, or are they about equal?
   United States 28 percent. Soviet Union 33 percent. About equal
29 percent. Don't know or no answer, 10 percent.
   10. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev?
   Favorable, 54 percent. Unfavorable, 20 percent. Don't know or no

   As a substitute for the Republican plan for a tax cut that would raise federal revenues, House Democrats are now officially offering a plan for a tax increase. 
Revenues aside, they just prefer high taxes. 

   Democrats of the now-dominant variety may have to agree that cutting the capital-gains tax to 19.6% would raise revenues in the initial year (in our view also over the long term). 
Still, they complain, this is a tax cut that benefits only the "wealthy." 
And "the wealthy" should pay higher tax rates. 
So the House Democratic leadership has proposed to stop the capital-gains tax cut and instead increase the top rate on the highest personal incomes from 28% to 33%. 
Since this change would affect only the very top tier of income, it wouldn't raise much money, but this is not the object. 

   Rather, House Democrats have been convinced that high taxes are good politics. 
They take their instruction from Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who believes that his own presidential-primary campaign proved this is the way politics works before being swept aside by the invincible Dukakis juggernaut. 
So the pretty-much open object of the 33% rate is to punish success, and thereby garner the votes of the nonsuccessful. 
Voters are presumed to be too dimwitted to recognize that the 33% proposal is the camel's nose under the tent, to be followed by higher taxes for the rich, the near-rich, the not-so-rich and everyone else. 

   At long last, in short, the political choice that defined the past three presidential elections is now the central issue of congressional politics. 
As it has developed over the past few months, the battle over a capital-gains cut has produced for the American electorate a rare opportunity to understand the two ideologies now competing for their assent. 
Turning the 33% proposal into law would not only bust George Bush's promise not to raise taxes but also would displace the competing philosophy of government established by Ronald Reagan over the eight years of his presidency. 

   The House Democrats have decided conclusively that the party's identity will sink or swim on the issue of taxes. 
They want more. 
The Democrats believe that the government is the most important institution in the nation's life, that the government exists to create programs and raise whatever taxes are necessary to fund those programs. 
It is really the most remarkable thing to see one of this country's major political parties espousing such a vision in the late 20th century. 

   By contrast, Ronald Reagan's support for tax cuts and his opposition to increased federal spending were based on his belief, stated at every opportunity, that the federal government and its great panoply of programs were smothering private initiative in the United States. 
He sought to reverse the Democrats' idea that America's growth and greatness depend on government initiatives and that the government is entitled to the taxes necessary to sustain and expand its responsibilities. 
It depends instead on letting all workers keep most of the country's newly produced wealth and on letting them decide, individually, how best to spend and invest the wealth their work has created. 
Under this regime, the U.S. is now experiencing its seventh straight year of economic growth. 

   Happily, not all Democrats have embraced the House leadership's vision. 
The capital-gains cut now on the table was authored by a Georgia Democrat and supported by five Democratic colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee. 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said Wednesday that he opposes the 33% plan. 
Connecticut's freshman Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman recently wrote an eloquent plea to his party on this issue: 

   "The argument of some Democrats against a cut in the capital gains tax -- that the rich will benefit more than the rest of us -- misses the point and is politically divisive. 
Lower- and middle-income people won't realize most of the tax savings for the obvious reason that they have less capital, but they could get something better: a job, if they have none, or a better job, if they are underemployed. 
After all, the whole idea of a capital gains tax cut is to induce people who have capital to move it into new investments that will make America more productive and competitive and benefit all of us with greater economic opportunity and security." 

   Senator Lieberman and presumably some of his fellow Democrats recognize that the United States is not a land of seething, resentful workers bereft of opportunity. 
The populism being peddled by Rep. Gephardt and the House Democrats reflects a complete misunderstanding of how America works and, not so incidentally, how America votes.

<TEXT>
   The United States lands in the middle of the pack
in rankings of life expectancy and death rates in 33 developed
nations, according to new figures from U.S. health officials.
   Atop the list: Japan.
   In the United States, the average life expectancy is 75 years,
trailing Japan by 4.1 years, but beating the lowest of the 33,
Hungary, by more than five years, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The average Hungarian lives 69.7 years, the CDC said.
   The United States also ranked near the middle of the 33 nations
in death rates from all causes: 828.4 deaths are reported for each
100,000 people each year. Japan was best at 628.8; Romania worst at
1,242.
   The leading cause of death in the United States, heart disease,
hits harder here than in other countries. The U.S. mortality rate
from heart disease was 382 per 100,000 per year for men and 214 for
women, compared with 339 and 206 in the other 32 developed
countries.
   Throughout the 33 countries, heart disease accounted for 30
percent of deaths, with cancer causing 21 percent and stroke
causing 14 percent.
   Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries _ about 1.5
million a year _ are attributed to smoking, the CDC said.
   Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries; 31
percent of U.S. males and 26 percent of American females smoke,
compared with 41 percent of men and 29 percent of women in the
other countries.
   ``The large number of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking
indicates that reduction of this risk factor would substantially
increase life expectancy in the developed world,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The CDC study included countries defined as developed according
to a 1963 U.N. standard pegged to reproductive rates: countries
where the average woman has fewer than two daughters who,
themselves, survive their childbearing years.
   Such areas include the United States and Canada, the Soviet
Union, most of Europe, some Latin American nations, Japan and
Australia.
   The CDC study cited life expectancies and death rates in the
latest available statistics for each country, from 1984 to 1987.
   Life expectancies for the 33 countries: Australia 76.3 years,
Austria 75.1, Belgium 74.3, Bulgaria 71.5, Canada 76.5,
Czechoslovakia 71.0, Denmark 74.9, East Germany 73.2, Finland 74.8,
France 75.9, Greece 76.5, Hungary 69.7, Iceland 77.4, Ireland 73.5,
Israel 75.2, Italy 75.5, Japan 79.1, Luxembourg 74.1, Malta 74.8,
Netherlands 76.5, New Zealand 74.2, Norway 76.3, Poland 71.0,
Portugal 74.1, Romania 69.9, Spain 76.6, Sweden 77.1, Switzerland
77.6, United Kingdom 75.3, United States 75.0, U.S.S.R. 69.8, West
Germany 75.8, Yugoslavia 71.0.

<HEAD>Poll Says Americans Favor Arms Treaty But Don't Trust Soviets</HEAD>

   Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in Congress
that Moscow cannot be trusted to comply, according to a Media
General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do President Reagan, and
Gorbachev out-polls Reagan among college-educated Americans.
   Seventy-three percent of those polled in the national survey
supported the accord to eliminate medium-range missiles, and as
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long-range
arsenal in half.
   But 61 percent said the Soviets can't be trusted to live up to
their arms control agreements. That reflected sentiment in the
Senate, which last week demanded clarification of the anti-cheating
rules in the pact.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,204 adults
interviewed by telephone from April 29-May 8, ending less than a
month before Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Moscow.
   As strongly pro-treaty as they were, a near-majority of
Americans were not willing to drop Reagan's proposed missile
defense system known as ``Star Wars'' in exchange for a Soviet
agreement to a big cut in nuclear arms. Forty-nine percent opposed
such a trade while just one-third supported it.
   The public was split on the issue along political and
ideological lines: Republicans and conservatives strongly opposed
dropping Star Wars for a big missile cut, while Democrats and
liberals favored such an agreement.
   Without an agreement, 56 percent said work on Star Wars should
proceed as it is now or be increased, while 30 percent said it
should be reduced or dropped. There again was a political division:
73 percent of Republicans wanted work on Star Wars kept up,
compared with 41 percent of Democrats.
   Similarly, there was an ideological division in support for the
medium-range treaty and for a treaty, if one can be reached, to
halve the long-range arsenals. The pacts fared worst among
conservatives _ 20 percent were opposed _ and best with liberals,
whose opposition was in single digits. About 67 percent of
conservatives and 83 percent of liberals were in favor.
   The survey found broad support for Reagan's handling of
U.S.-Soviet relations, with 71 percent approving, and a high
positive view of Reagan generally, with 59 percent rating him
favorably.
   Nearly as many _ 54 percent _ expressed a positive view of
Gorbachev, the poll found. Among college graduates, 71 percent
rated Gorbachev favorably while 62 percent viewed Reagan favorably;
among those who have done postgraduate work, 76 percent saw
Gorbachev favorably, compared with 50 percent favorable for Reagan.
   Reagan had the approval of the poll's respondents for his May
29-June 2 summit with Gorbachev in Moscow. Seventy-eight percent
said the president and the Soviet leader should meet at regular
intervals even without any major items on the agenda.
   The survey gave a mixed report on U.S.-Soviet competition.
Forty-one percent said the United States had more political
influence in the world and just 14 percent said the Soviets had
more political influence. Thirty-eight percent said the countries
were about equally influential.
   The rating was closer on military strength: 33 percent said the
Soviets were stronger militarily, 28 percent said the United States
was stronger and 29 percent said the countries were about equally
strong.
   Poll respondents largely rejected the opinion of critics that
nuclear arms treaties may increase the chance of non-nuclear war. A
majority said the medium-range missile treaty would not make much
difference in the chance of conventional war in Europe, and 26
percent said it would decrease the chance.
   Just 11 percent said the treaty would increase the chance of
conventional war in Europe. That figure doubled, though, when
respondents were asked if abolition of all U.S. and Soviet nuclear
weapons would increase the chance of non-nuclear war; 22 percent,
still a minority, said it would.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of three points. Media

publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader,

<HEAD>Reporters' Notebook: With Reagan at the Waldorf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For President Reagan, his trip to New York for
the United Nations General Assembly meant a dramatic farewell
appearance. For fellow guests at his hotel, it meant something of a
nuisance.
   For reporters and photographers, it meant scrambling up and down
stairwells, waiting in line in a hotel kitchen and getting stuck in
an elevator.
   Reagan spoke at the U.N. on Monday, making his seventh
appearance there and his last before he leaves office in January.
   After his speech, he went to the United States Mission to the
United Nations for lunch. It's just across the street, so most
people would walk. Presidential security, however, required that he
make the crossing by motorcade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Then it was off to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a few blocks away.
   The Waldorf had warned its guests of what was coming.
   ``It is my great pleasure to tell you that President Ronald
Reagan will be staying in the Waldorf Towers during your stay in
the hotel,'' manager Richard J. Cotter said in a letter handed out
at the registration desk.
   ``Unfortunately, however, it may mean some inconvenience for
you,'' Cotter added. ``To ensure the president's safety, the Park
Avenue entrance will be closed from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Monday
evening. Please be so kind as to enter and exit the hotel from the
Lexington Avenue area.''
   One woman entering the hotel from Lexington Avenue still found
herself inconvenienced when she was asked by a White House aide to
step aside while the traveling pool of journalists made their way
through the door.
   ``But we're staying here,'' she protested.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Once inside, the pool was taken by elevator to a holding room on
the 33rd floor to wait until it was time to walk up three floors to
where the president was holding the first in a series of meetings
with foreign leaders.
   After a brief picture-taking and question-asking opportunity,
the scribes scrambled back down to the holding room to file stories
by telephone and wait for the next meeting.
   In a few minutes, however, a harried assistant manager of the
hotel showed up to announce that the room set aside as the holding
room turned out to be part of a suite rented to a permanent hotel
guest. So it was out in the hall for the reporters and their
telephones.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The next event after the series of meetings was an evening
reception in a room decked with magnificent crystal chandeliers. To
get to it, reporters were ushered through the kitchen, past tray
after tray of dirty dishes, before standing in line to have
security officers check their equipment.
   Next morning, reporters were assembled in their third-floor
press room and taken to three elevators for the ride back up to the
33rd floor to wait for more meetings. At the ninth floor, one of
the elevators got stuck for 10 minutes.
   Word of the mishap apparently even got to the president.
   When the media people arrived on the 36th floor for Reagan's
meeting with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan, the
president told them, ``You seem like you've been breathing hard.
I'm trying to pick out the ones who had to walk up the stairs.''

<HEAD>Opposition Scorns Noriega Offer; Strike Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his
resignation and kept Panama shut down Tuesday with a general strike
intended to force him out.
   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by
the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day.
Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted
and many government employees did not go to work.
   Panama is out of cash because of pressure from the United States
to force the ouster of Noriega, who is the real power in Panama as
commander of its 15,000 soldiers and police. The U.S. dollar is the
national currency and the supply has been cut off.
   Most government workers were paid only $75 of their midmonth
wages last week and the $33 million end-of-the-month payroll for
the 130,000 public employees problably won't be met. Pension checks
due Wednesday have been delayed, at least until March 28.
   Hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor,
unemployed and elderly. Many washerwomen, cleaning women, maids and
cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to
pay them.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the civilian Noriega chose to run the
government, said on television Monday night the general would
resign in exchange for ``a national dialogue'' to reconcile
differences with opponents of the regime. He prefaced the offer
with a diatribe against the United States.
   The implication was that Noriega, under federal court indictment
in Florida on narcotics and money laundering charges, would stay in
Panama and might retain power behind the scenes.
   Calling the offer a ``noble gesture,'' Solis Palma said Noriega
pledged ``as an officer and a gentleman'' to resign before
presidential elections scheduled for May 1989.
   Solis Palma, who has the title ``minister in charge of the
presidency,'' said he would not accept Noriega's resignation unless
``all of the political forces in the country'' join ``a national
dialogue.''
   Noriega put Solis Palma in office Feb. 26, after President Eric
Arturo Delvalle tried to fire the general and the legislature
dismissed Delvalle instead.
   Delvalle, still recognized by the United States, is hiding in
Panama. His dismissal began a run on Panama's banks and they were
closed the next week.
   Pressure from Washington has included freezing virtually all
Panamanian funds in the United States, including revenue from the
Panama Canal.
   Reagan administration spokesmen rejected the Noriega proposal.
Last week, Noriega turned down a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama
and live in Spain.
   The general said his plan was a ``Panamanian solution'' to the
crisis.
   ``I have no reason to talk to the United States,'' he told
reporters after Solis Palma's speech. ``I talk to Panamanians.''
   Guillermo Cochez, vice president of the Christian Democratic
Party, said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33
members, 22 of them supporting Noriega.
   ``This is not a dialogue,'' he said ``It's just cynicism.''
   Aurelio Barria said: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not
eventually.
   Barria is a leader of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of
200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called
the general strike. It was organized last June to lead the campaign
against Noriega.
   Solis Palma spoke on television for 30 minutes, devoting all but
the last five minutes to castigating the United States. He accused
Washington of ``economic aggression'' in ``an undeclared state of
war.''
   He claimed the United States wants to renege on the 1977
treaties under which the Panama Canal will be turned over to this
country at midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   The canal, guarded by about 10,000 U.S. troops, has been
operating normally despite the crisis. The United States sent 300
more soldiers Monday, most of them security personnel.
   Because of increasing hunger, the Rev. Francisco Verar said his
Roman Catholic church in the poor San Miguelito suburb is feeding
more families every day.
   ``If we had not done this there would have been chaos, even
cases of death,'' he said. ``We have people who have gone five, six
days without food.''
   Longshoremen, on strike for more than a week, voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to stay out but accepted part payment of
back wages despite fears of compromising their position.
   ``There are mothers and fathers who have to feed their
children,'' said Luis Asprilla, a union leader.
   In some parts of Panama City, workers formed vigilante groups to
guard stores and other places of employment. Looting occurred
during street protests against Noriega last week.

   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Aug. 20, 1964, President Lyndon B.
Johnson signed a nearly $1 billion anti-poverty measure.
   On this date:
   In 1833, Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United
States, was born in North Bend, Ohio.
   In 1866, President Andrew Johnson formally declared the Civil
War over, even though fighting had stopped months earlier.
   In 1914, German forces occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World
War I.
   In 1918, Britain opened its offensive on the Western front
during World War I.
   In 1920, America's first commercial radio station, 8MK in
Detroit (later WWJ), began daily broadcasting.
   In 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill paid tribute
to the Royal Air Force, saying, ``Never in the field of human
conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.''
   In 1948, the United States ordered the expulsion of the Soviet
consul general in New York, Jacob Lomakin, accusing him of
attempting to force the return of two consular employees to the
Soviet Union against their will.
   In 1953, the Soviet Union publicly acknowledged it had conducted
a test detonation of a hydrogen bomb.
   In 1955, hundreds of people were killed in anti-French rioting
in Morocco and Algeria.
   In 1968, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations began
invading Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague Spring''
liberalization drive of Alexander Dubcek's regime.
   In 1977, the United States launched Voyager 2, an unmanned
spacecraft carrying a 12-inch copper phonograph record containing
greetings in dozens of languages, samples of music and natural
sounds.
   In 1980, the U.N. Security Council voted 14-0, with the United
States abstaining, to condemn Israel's declaration that all of
Jerusalem was its capital.
   In 1986, mail carrier Patrick Henry Sherrill went on a deadly
rampage at a post office in Edmond, Oklahoma, shooting 14 fellow
workers to death before killing himself.
   Ten years ago: Swimmer Diana Nyad succeeded in her third attempt
at swimming from the Bahamas to Florida, arriving at Juno Beach 27
hours and 38 minutes after leaving North Bimini.
   Five years ago: Republicans opened their 33rd national
convention in Dallas as they prepared to nominate President Ronald
Reagan and Vice President George Bush for second terms in office.
   One year ago: Eight British soldiers were killed by an Irish
Republican Army land mine that destroyed a military bus near Omagh,
County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland.
   Today's birthdays: Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, is 56. Actor Sam Melville is 49. Musician Isaac Hayes is
47. The prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is 45. CBS
newscaster Connie Chung is 43.
   Thought for today: ``That is one of the bitter curses of
poverty; it leaves no right to be generous.'' _ George Gissing,
English author and critic (1857-1903).

   As George Bush seeks to overcome his negative
ratings in presidential campaign polls, he might draw hope from
recent history: Ronald Reagan suffered equally low ratings in his
races and overcame them to win.
   But this year there is an important difference, poll analysts
say. While Reagan won by beating opponents who were viewed even
less favorably than he was, Bush faces a far more popular opponent
in Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis has scored high favorable ratings in polls this spring,
though not as high as Jimmy Carter at his pinnacle of popularity in
June of the 1976 election year. Bush has scored poorly, though not
nearly as poorly as Carter at his nadir in 1980.
   Such measures, taken by asking if poll respondents have a
favorable or unfavorable view of candidates, provide an important
guide to vote-getting ability. A poor score ``means that there's a
chunk of people who don't like you,'' said CBS News pollster
Kathleen A. Frankovic. ``They probably won't vote for you _ unless,
of course, they can't stand the other guy more.''
   Strategists on both sides have focused lately on favorability
ratings, with Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach contending
Bush was ``sitting on some of the highest unfavorable ratings of a
presidential candidate in recent memory.''
   Dach said Tuesday he based that claim on Gallup Poll figures,
but the Gallup Organization said its past figures are not
comparable to its current ones because it changed its questions and
procedures. In other, comparable polls, other candidates have rated
considerably worse than Bush rates now.
   Still, Bush's negative rating is high _ 33 percent favorable to
35 percent unfavorable in a CBS News-New York Times poll in May, 51
percent favorable to 35 percent unfavorable in a May ABC
News-Washington Post poll, 53-40 favorable to unfavorable in a
Gallup poll this week.
   Contrast the ratings for Dukakis: 38-14 favorable to unfavorable
in the CBS-Times poll, 64-11 in the ABC-Post's, 70-20 in Gallup's.
   The general election campaign, though, hardly has begun. ``We're
looking at where these people are starting out,'' Frankovic said.
``Michael Dukakis is starting out very nicely. George Bush is
starting out with as many people disliking him as liking him. So
he's got some work to do.''
   Bush's negatives are by no means historic. All three candidates
in the 1980 and 1984 elections _ Reagan, Carter and Walter Mondale
_ had as bad or worse favorability ratings during their campaigns.
In June 1980, Carter's CBS-Times rating was a dismal 33 favorable
to 60 unfavorable.
   Bush's 33-35 score in the CBS-Times poll was comparable to
Reagan's 38-38 favorability rating in September 1980. But Reagan
had the advantage of facing Carter, the unpopular incumbent.
   While Bush does not have an unpopular opponent, there has been
some movement in Dukakis' rating: He went from 15 percent
unfavorable in a Gallup Poll in May to 20 percent unfavorable the
new Gallup Poll.
   The key issue is not where a candidate stands when considered
alone, but where he stands in relationship to his opponent. ``In
1976 people liked both of them,'' said Frankovic. ``In 1980 they
really didn't like either of them. And in 1984 you had a popular
incumbent.''
   Even Reagan's advantage was not apparent from the start. In
January 1984, an ABC News-Washington Post poll gave Reagan a 54-38
favorable rating and Mondale a 48-30 rating. But 23 percent didn't
know about Mondale; many went against him, and he lost in a
landslide.
   As many, 25 percent, didn't know about Dukakis in the ABC-Post
poll in May, and pollsters noted that his high favorable rating
came amid positive publicity as he chalked up a string of primary
victories over Jesse Jackson.
   ``Dukakis has a quarter of the people who have to get to know
him,'' said Kelly Hanley, an ABC News poll analyst. ``Bush is going
to start talking about Dukakis' record, and we'll see how people
react to that.''
   Bush, with the Republican nomination wrapped up, was out of the
news in May. With voters not yet focused on the race, his rating
may have been more a reflection of Reagan's lagging popularity than
of his own standing.
   ``Those negatives don't represent some personal shortcoming with
George Bush as much as some dissatisfaction with the Reagan
administration,'' said Larry Hugick, of the Gallup Organization.
``I don't think people have much of a sense of Bush and Dukakis yet
to give a response to these questions.''
   The issue for the campaigns, the analysts said, is whether Bush
can establish his own, positive identity separate from Reagan, and
whether he can capitalize on the public's unfamiliarity with
Dukakis.

   When President Bush looks for votes on Capitol
Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his
savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact
most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last
November.
   House members and political analysts differ among themselves on
the impact of Bush's lack of coattails.
   But there is no argument that while Bush was carrying 40 of the
50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided
government by choosing a Republican president and a Democratic
Congress.
   ``There was a big message in this election and George Bush
picked it up,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House
Democratic whip.
   Coelho praised Bush for ``trying to establish a level of trust
that hasn't existed for 12 years.''
   ``You run independent of everyone,'' said Republican Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois.
   But she insisted that a president's persuasive ability is not
tied to the results of the last election.
   ``If the president calls you and asks you to vote for something,
any living member of Congress who says it is easy to say no, is
absolutely saying that for a press statement,'' she said. ``After
the election it isn't Democrat or Republican, it's the president.''
   An analysis of the 1988 election results, published in the
National Journal, found that Bush ran ahead of the successful House
candidate in only 56 of the 435 House districts.
   Bush out polled only 26 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Half of
the Democrats were from the South, Bush's strongest region in the
presidential vote.
   While those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the president's
electoral weakness, they might more accurately reflect the strength
of House members. Of the 435 House winners in 1988, only 63
received under 60 percent of the vote.
   By contrast, when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he ran
ahead of 59 Republican winners. In addition his coattails were
credited with giving Republicans control of the Senate for the
first time in a quarter century and with a GOP pickup of 33 House
seats.
   Did that make a difference?
   ``It was very easy to deal with reluctant Republicans or
persuadable Democrats'' during Reagan's first two years in office,
said Rich Bond, a Republican consultant who was involved in trying
to generate support for Reagan's agenda.
   Reagan's clout on Capitol Hill diminished sharply after the 1982
midterm election when the Democrats won back 26 House seats.
   ``It was back to business as usual,'' said Bond.
   ``I've always been the Republican in whose district our
presidential candidates did least well,'' said Rep. Bill Green of
New York whose district runs along the East Side of Manhattan.
Green was re-elected with 61 percent of the vote, while Bush was
receiving only 33 percent against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``I was the only Republican elected in a district Reagan didn't
carry in '84,'' said Green.
   Green describes himself as a progressive Republican and his
support for Reagan in House votes declined from a high of 55
percent of the time in 1981 to 38 percent in 1986, according to
Congressional Quarterly.
   The New York congressman said, ``Plainly in 1981 one of the
things Reagan had going for him in winning votes in Congress was
the ability to persuade marginal Democrats in certain parts of the
country that if they didn't come along they'd be very vulnerable in
1982.
   ``Obviously, that kind of capacity is lacking (for Bush) at this
point.''
   Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, said, ``We're getting to the point where there will be
zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns.
   ``It reinforces the view on Capitol Hill that their electoral
fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no
electoral ties that bind. Whatever incentives they have for working
with the president, elections are not one of them.''
   ``Not many members of Congress are going to quake in their boots
when presidents try to force them to do things,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise
Institute.
   ``Presidents win by big margins; presidents win by small
margins; members of Congress go marching on,'' he said.
   Stephen Hess, who served on the White House staffs of presidents
Eisenhower and Nixon, said members of Congress get a sense of a
president's clout in their districts from polls and letters and
from their trips back home.
   ``They don't need to look at last November's election returns to
know how well George Bush stands in their district and, of course,
George Bush probably stands in their district better than he did on
November 8.''
   ``A president is not a hapless giant,'' said Hess. ``There are
appointments members want, there are grants that they want, there
are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want.''
   Lynn Martin echoed that view.
   ``What the president has to offer members is not really
electability,'' she said. ``It's coming in for fund-raisers, it is
the White House, it is members feeling they are working with the
president of the United States to accomplish something.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has accused the
United States of ordering thousands of rebels to re-enter Nicaragua
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Joan.
   Meanwhile, it was reported today that some U.S. charities trying
provide humanitarian relief to Nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane
claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the Reagan
administration.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and
television address.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
Contras were receiving only U.S. humanitarian aid.
   ``The fact is Mr. Ortega is trying to conceal the continuous
buildup they have carried out with the help of Cuba and the Soviet
Union,'' Matamoros said.
   Ortega said the Reagan administration had re-armed the rebels,
known as Contras, and instructed them to ``sabotage and slow
reconstruction work and delay the coffee harvest,'' economically
vital to Nicaragua's already staggering economy.
   ``Facing a threat such as this when we are facing the
consequences of this hurricane, Nicaraguans are obliged to mobilize,
organize, to fulfill the job of defending the country,'' Ortega said.
   Some private U.S. organizations complained the Reagan
administration has refused to assist their efforts to deliver
donated goods to Nicaragua and has even threatened to declare
shipments of construction supplies illegal under the U.S. economic
embargo of the country.
   ``It's kind of appalling that the White House and the State
Department are interfering in the process of disaster aid,'' Richard
M. Walden, president of Operation California, a Los Angeles-based
relief group organizing an airlift to Nicaragua next week, was
quoted as saying today in the Los Angeles Times.
   White House and State Department officials denied any deliberate
effort to block private aid, but they acknowledged the
administration has taken few steps to assist the charities, the
Times said.
   The Soviet-backed Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported
Contras agreed in March to halt offensive operations in their 7-year
civil war. The government unilaterally has extended the truce on a
month-to-month basis. The current extension ends Monday.
   Ortega offered no proof of his allegations and did not say that
mobilization meant the government was allowing the cease-fire to
lapse.
   Most of the Contras retreated to base camps in Honduras after the
U.S. Congress refused to renew arms aid. Legislation approved by
Congress does allow delivery of food, shelter, clothing and medical
services to the rebels.
   The leftist government frequently has compared the effort to
survive last week's killer hurricane to its struggle against the
Contras. On Friday, Ortega repeated his assertion that an end to
Contra aid would be the best hurricane assistance the United States
could offer.
   Citing the latest government data, Ortega said Hurricane Joan
left 103 dead and 186,950 homeless. Previous government figures
estimated the number of dead at more than 60, with about 300,000
homeless.
   Ortega said 110 people were missing, an additional 178 were
seriously hurt and 324,861 were evacuated from their homes; 29,152
homes were destroyed; 33 bridges were destroyed and 33 others
damaged, and 400 miles of roads suffered direct damage.
   The cattle and fishing industries, and rice, cotton, grain,
sugar, cacao and African palm crops suffered serious damage and
``unmeasurable'' ecological damage was done, Ortega said.
   The storm ripped across 200 miles of Nicaraguan territory from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
   ``The data indicate we met our main goal, to save lives,'' Ortega
said.
   He thanked Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Britain and the European
Economic Community for their aid and said East Germany and the
Soviet Union also promised help.
   The president called the aid ``necessary and urgent.''

   The Super Tuesday primaries produced a
blizzard of numbers. Here are some figures from exit polls
conducted by ABC News in a dozen Southern states that help provide
a snapshot of who voted how:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ White voters were narrowly split between Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr., 34 percent to 33 percent. But Jesse Jackson's 10
percent share of the white vote helped him roll to victory in
several deep South states.
   _ Black voters favored Jackson by margins of 95 percent or
higher.
   _ Hispanics gave 42 percent of their votes to Dukakis, 23
percent to Jackson.
   _ Protestants favored Gore over Jackson, 31 percent to 27
percent.
   _ Catholics went with Dukakis by 45 percent to Jackson's 16
percent.
   _ Jewish voters picked Dukakis by 78 percent to Gore's 11
percent. Jackson had three percent of the Jewish vote, as did
Richard Gephardt.
   _ Born-again Christians picked Jackson by 40 percent to Gore's
29 percent. But among only white born-again Christians, Gore got 46
percent to Dukakis's 22 percent and Jackson's eight percent.
Jackson got 96 percent of the black born-again vote. Evangelicals
sided with Dukakis, 27 percent, over Gore, 22 percent, and Jackson,
21 percent.
   _ About a third of Democratic primary voters in the South had
pulled the lever for Ronald Reagan in 1984. They favored Gore (35
percent) over Dukakis (25 percent), Gephardt (15 percent) and
Jackson (12 percent).
   _ Pat Robertson was the candidate with the highest negatives
among Democratic voters. Forty-five percent said they definitely
would not vote for him. Thirty-seven percent expressed the same
sentiment about George Bush, 36 percent about Gary Hart and 29
percent about Jackson.
   _ Eighty-two percent of Democratic voters said the next
president should change the course set by Reagan; among them, 33
percent were for Jackson, 29 percent Dukakis and 22 percent Gore.
Among the 18 percent who want the next president to follow Reagan's
course, 38 percent were for Gore, 21 percent for Dukakis and 16
percent for Jackson.
   _ Dukakis commanded 75 percent of the Greek-American vote, and
70 percent of the Italian-Americans.
   _ Forty-seven percent of farmers went for Dukakis; so did 39
percent of the feminists.
   _ Five percent of the voters were from union households.
Thirty-seven percent of them went for Jackson, 31 percent for
Dukakis and 22 percent for Gore.
   _ Nearly a quarter said the national economy was the overriding
issue, and they went with Dukakis by 35 percent to 24 percent for
Jackson and 20 percent for Gore.

   _ The youngest voters and those in their 50s were George Bush's
biggest supporters. Those age 18-24 favored Bush over Dole by 73
percent to 11 percent, while those in their 50s picked him by 65
percent to 14 percent.
   _ Dole's worst showing was among high school graduates and
dropouts, where he trailed Bush by 60-17; his best was among those
with more than four years of college, where he narrowed the gap to
50-33.
   _ Among Protestants, Bush beat Dole 58-21, with Robertson
claiming 17 percent and Kemp 3 percent. Among Catholics, Bush
trounced Dole, 72-21, with Kemp getting 6 percent.
   _ Among born-again Christians, Bush beat Robertson, 46-33, with
Dole third at 14 percent and Kemp at 5 percent. Among white
born-agains, Bush was the choice, 44-34, over Robertson. Among
evangelicals, Bush was the choice by 48-28 over Dole, with
Robertson third at 18 percent and Kemp last at 5 percent.
   _ Among the five percent of Republican voters who owned up to
voting for Walter Mondale in 1984, Dole was the choice by 33-30
over Bush, with Robertson at 17 percent and Kemp at 13 percent.
   _ Among Reagan voters, Bush walloped Dole, 62-19, with Robertson
getting 14 percent and Kemp 4 percent.
   _ Robertson got eight percent of the votes of those who called
themselves liberals or moderates, but 16 percent of the
conservatives. His conservative votes came at Dole's expense.
   _ Robertson was near the top of the Republican voters' list of
candidates they definitely would not vote for. Forty-two percent
mentioned Hart; 41 percent said Robertson and Jackson; 23 percent
Simon and 21 percent Dukakis.
   _ Seventy-nine percent wanted to stay the Reagan course; they
favored Bush 64-17 over Dole, with 13 percent for Robertson and 5
percent for Dole. Among the 21 percent who want a change, Bush led
Dole 47-38, with 10 percent for Robertson and 3 percent for Kemp.
   _ Republican voters from union households picked Dole with 56
percent over Bush and Robertson, both 22 percent.
   _ Among those who considered the candidates' stands on abortion
crucial, Robertson tied Bush with 40 percent.
   _ Eighty percent of Jews went for Bush, 20 percent for Dole.
   The ABC exit polls had a standard margin of error of five points
in either direction. ABC interviewed voters as they exited 690
precincts around the Super Tuesday states. It questioned at least
1,000 voters in each Republican primary state and 700 in the
Democratic primaries.
   Many of these results were based on an extended questionnaire
given to voters at 50 precincts across the South.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make
another visit to the United States next month to address the United
Nations and will meet with President Reagan, U.S. officials said
Monday.
   Gorbachev also is expected to meet with President-elect George
Bush while he is in New York.
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
a report by CBS.
   Earlier, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa would visit London Dec. 12-14.
   Reagan met with Gorbachev in Washington last December, the third
of their four summit meetings. They signed a treaty to abolish U.S.
and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush said last week he was interested in a meeting with Gorbachev
if it could produce progress on arms control, human rights or
regional disputes.
   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, who he
has named his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with foreign ministers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Bush ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquainted
with him,'' the president-elect said. ``What I want to see is
progress. I`ve never supported meetings just for the sake of having
meetings.''
   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in
November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Iceland,
then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to sharply reduce
their strategic nuclear weapons, but are wrestling with problems
over how to verify some of the cutbacks.
   On the regional front, the Soviets have suspended the withdrawal
of their troops from Afghanistan. But the pullout is not supposed to
completed until Feb. 15, and Reagan administration officials have
expressed confidence the Soviets would meet the deadline.
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said of a
Gorbachev visit: ``There has been no official announcement from the
U.S.S.R. on this question. Therefore it is inappropriate for us to
comment now.''

   Americans want the United Nations, not
national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and
to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll
released Wednesday.
   The Roper Organization survey also found strong support for
increased American financing of U.N. programs for peace, food
production, population control and health.
   In conflicts among countries where the United States has an
interest, U.N. forces should be used in an effort to accommodate
all parties, said 49 percent of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed.
   Only 17 percent said the United States should use force to
impose its own solution; 20 percent said ``it depends,'' and 14
percent had no opinion.
   ``That is, in effect, a tough policy choice, and we were
surprised to see a 3-to-1 margin of support for U.N. intervention
rather than unilateral U.S. intervention,'' said Jeffrey Laurenti
of the U.N. Association of the U.S.A., a private non-profit group
that commissioned the poll.
   Of the respondents, 46 percent wanted America and other U.N.
members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully,
11 percent favored less spending, 31 percent said the right amount
is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion.
   The United Nations should have the power to control the
manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the United States and
other countries, said 49 percent, but 33 percent opposed that and
18 percent were unsure.
   U.N. control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation
was favored by 36 percent. The same percentage opposed it and 18
percent were unsure.
   Sixty percent said all U.N. members should pay their full dues
regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes. Fourteen
percent said funds could be withheld, the same number said ``it
depends'' and 12 percent had no opinion.
   President Reagan and Congress withheld more than a $500 million
from the United Nations in recent years to force fiscal reforms and
because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization.
   Reagan finally said the United States would pay all back dues if
current reforms continued, and President Bush has reaffirmed the
pledge.
   When asked how much money the United States and other U.N.
member countries should spend on U.N. projects, the respondents
favored more funds for most social programs, including eradicating
disease and improving health care; slowing population growth
through birth control; increasing world food production, and
protecting the environment.
   Burns Roper, head of the Roper Organization, said the poll
indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more
Americans thought the United Nations was doing a good job than felt
it was doing poorly.
   It was conducted March 11-18 through personal interviews with
nearly 2,000 adults chosen at random. Roper said the margin of
error was about 3 percent.

   President Reagan said Thursday the United
States is not going to play ``big colossus of the North'' and use
military force to get Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega out of power.
   In a question-and-answer session with high school students in
this Washington suburb, Reagan was asked if he thought it would be
necessary to resume U.S. military control in Panama to protect the
safety of the canal zone.
   ``No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty (relinquishing
the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century),'' he
replied. ``And we're not going to be the big colossus of the North
once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of
living and business and trying to guide and direct them.''
   The president said the Panamanians ``have a very difficult
problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with
the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of
this problem.''
   Reagan said the United States wants ``to be of help in any way
we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic
restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure
focused on this particular individual.''
   ``But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and
muscle and saying, `This is the way it has to be.'''
   Meanwhile, the federal Agency for International Development has
agreed to release $250,000 in emergency funds to buy food for the
poor in Panama.
   The food will be purchased in Panama if it is available and
distributed through Caritas, a Catholic relief agency said AID
spokesman Jim Kunder.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in
the United States last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   The Panamanian government was unable to fully meet a $33 million
payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching
off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once
considered loyal to Noriega.

   Meanwhile, the office of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said that
the federal Agency for International Development will provide
emergency food to the people of Panama, at least $25,000 worth of
food per day to be distributed through Caritas, a Catholic relief
agency.
   The money for the food would come from the federal disaster
relief fund, said Ed Martin, a D'Amato spokesman. He said he did
not know how long the aid would continue.
   AID officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A
man answering the phone there late Thursday said no one was in the
agency's Latin bureau. The agency was known to be considering such
a move.

<HEAD>Government Orders Soldiers Not To Harm Americans, Hardship For
Easter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it ordered its
soldiers not to give Washington a pretext for armed intervention
and it failed to meet another payroll for civil servants, dampening
Easter celebrations.
   Thousands of people lined up for meals provided by charity,
casualties of the 5-week-old campaign to try to force the ouster of
Panama's de facto leader, Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The office of acting President Manuel Solis Palma issued a
communique Thursday alleging the United States was looking for an
incident that could justify military intervention.
   It cited a letter from Solis to Javier Perez de Cuellar, the
U.N. secretary-general, that said recent U.S. military movements in
Panama and its territorial waters constituted a security threat.
   ``The Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from using
lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces
of the United States or against U.S. civilians or against property
or installations of citizens or the government of the United
States,'' the communique says.
   Solis was apparently referring to the passage of the U.S.
helicopter carrier Okinawa through the Panama Canal this week and
military exercises being conducted by troops stationed at the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war,'' Solis said. ``Under no circumstances will Panama
allow itself to be provoked nor will it lend itself to the
fabrication of an incident.''
   It mentions the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, which the
Reagan administration said was necessary to protect U.S. students
there.
   On Monday night, police and soldiers arrested and beat several
foreign journalists, including Americans, during a raid on a Panama
City hotel. The next day, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
condemned the incident.
   ``It has always been a principle that we will protect American
citizens as best we can. And while we have said that we don't plan
to go in (to Panama) militarily, it is also important to note that
there are limits,'' he said.
   The government shut down on Thursday for the Easter weekend
without paying most of its 130,000 public employees for the second
time in a month.
   It failed to meet the $33 million payroll despite the collection
this week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $5.5
million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S. companies doing
business in Panama.
   In Washington, the Senate voted 92-1 for a resolution urging
President Reagan to cut off the flow of money from U.S.
corporations to the regime of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment
on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   Most Panamanians are short of cash and food as a result of an
11-day-old general strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in
part by a U.S. freeze on millions of dollars of Panamanian assets
in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed after the Noriega-orchestrated ouster
Feb. 26 of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in retaliation for
Delvalle's attempt to fire Noriega.
   Banks have been closed since March 3.
   With most businesses and industries observing the general
strike, the largest congregations of people were found in the food
lines of welfare agencies.
   The Rev. Laurino Duran, head of a Roman Catholic Church relief
society, said his organization was feeding 9,000 families a day.
   ``The number is growing daily,'' the priest said, adding that
the effort is costing $600,000 a month, which the church receives
in donated cash and food.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.
   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from
here,'' said Roberto Aleman, an attorney and director of the
Crusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor,
political and other groups.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He'll Return Body Of American Killed In 1986 Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said he is willing to hand over
the body of a U.S. pilot killed during the 1986 air raid on Libya,
the official news agency JANA reported today.
   Gadhafi said the body of Capt. Paul Lorence would be given to his
family ``through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in London
and Rome.
   Lorence, 31, of San Francisco, and Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33,
of Utuado, Puerto Rico, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the
April 15, 1986, raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. The other 17 U.S. Air
Force bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about
100 tons of bombs on the two cities.
   The attack was in retaliation for what the Reagan administration
said was Libya's support for international terrorism. Libyan
authorities said the raids killed about 40 people, including
Gadhafi's 15-month-old adopted daughter.
   ``The brother leader has also invited the family of the U.S.
pilot (Capt. Paul) Lorence, whose plane was shot down during the
failed U.S. barbaric and savage attack on Tripoli and Benghazi ...
to take possession of his body which will be handed through the pope
(of the Vatican), especially since this occasion coincides with the
end of the rule of the Reagan administration, the `murderer of
children,''' the JANA dispatch said.
   It said he made the comments to a group of Arab Christians.
   At the Vatican, deputy spokesman Giovanni D'ercole said the Roman
Catholic Church had no immediate comment.
   After the 1986 raids, diplomats in Libya said Gadhafi was
demanding a ransom or concessions from the United States before
returning the airman's body.
   Three months after the attack, Libyan television showed pictures
of a body it said was Lorence.
   Western witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash into the
Mediterranean Sea soon after being hit, apparently by a missile,
during the raid on Tripoli.
   Relations between the United States and Libya have been more
strained than usual lately. President Reagan has charged Libya has
constructed a plant to produce chemical weapons, and has said
Washington was talking with its allies about a possible attack on
the facility.
   Gadhafi has claimed the plant produces pharmaceuticals.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, embarking on a 12-day
trip to Australia and Southeast Asia, vowed Monday to address
``head-on ... concerns that the United States is a nation in
decline.''
   Before leaving the United States on his second trip abroad since
taking office, Quayle addressed the annual meeting of The
Associated Press.
   He told the newspaper publishers his trip to Asia was designed
to underscore the U.S. commitment to the Pacific rim and gain
``firsthand familiarity'' with the area.
   Moreover, he said some American and Asian observers wonder if
the United States ``is really a great nation in decline,'' with
high budget and trade deficits a sign of malaise.
   Those observers ask themselves, ``Can we (the United States)
still be relied on to play a leadership role in the Pacific? And,
if not, who else is there to replace us?
   ``An important purpose of my trip is to address these concerns
head on ...,'' Quayle said. ``The United States is focusing on the
region as never before.''
   He said he intends to remind the Asian allies ``that the current
wave of `declinist' thought in the United States is hardly a new
phenomenon.''
   Elaborating, the vice president said, ``Books predicting
America's imminent fall from world leadership have made the
best-seller list and prophets of American decline have become
virtual academic celebrities.
   ``All of this naturally arouses a good deal of apprehension
among our friends and allies in Asia.''
   He did not identify any ``declinists'' by name.
   Periodically, he said, waves of pessimism have swept the United
States. Yet, he added, such national introspection is healthy
because ``it's usually a sign of renewal, not of decline.''
   Quayle said the overall purpose of his whirlwind trip, which
will take him and his wife, Marilyn, to Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand as well as Australia, is to show that the United States
intends ``to play an important role in the Pacific.''
   In a question-and-answer session with the AP group, Quayle said
one of the things he's most enjoyed about his first 100 days in
office is his involvement in foreign policy.
   The vice president, who visited Central and South America soon
after he was inaugurated, said most of his trips as senator had
been back home to Indiana.
   From Chicago, Quayle flew to Los Angeles to meet with former
President Ronald Reagan before he left for Australia.
   Quayle and his wife met briefly with Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
at Reagan's office in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Posing for
photographers, Quayle presented a wrapped American flag to Reagan,
the same flag that had flown over the American embassy in Kabal,
Afghanistan, until the Soviet troops invaded in 1979.
   When the Soviets announced their attention to leve Afghanistan,
the flag was once again hoisted above the embassy on May 15, 1988.
   ``I'm very proud to have this...I have a feeling this will find
its way into the Ronald Reagan library,'' said the smiling former
Reagan.
   Reagan also said he thought President Bush had done a good job
in the first 100 days. ``He is there to keep in progress the things
we did for eight years,'' Reagan said.
   Later in the evening, Quayle was to receive an award presented
by Reagan's financial backers at a Republican fund-raiser.
   On his return to the United States, Quayle will tour Alaska's
Prince William Sound to see for himself cleanup efforts after the
March 24 grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which dumped 10.1
million gallons of crude oil in the sound.
   Trade, space, defense, environmental pollution and chemical
warfare were issues Quayle said he would bring up with U.S. allies.
   His journey, in which he will combine substantive talks with
sightseeing and social events, is taking place shortly before the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 20 years. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is visiting China in May.
   ``We recognize the Soviet interest in sharing in Asia's economic
boom and in increasing its access to the region,'' he said.
   ``But Moscow has a long way to go to achieve that goal,'' he
said.
   However, he said, the Soviets continue to modernize military
forces in Asia and has one of its largest fleets stationed in Asia.

   The special relationship forged between Britain
and the United States during Ronald Reagan's presidency will thrive
under George Bush but on a more businesslike footing, analysts
predict.
   That relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual NATO
summit in Brussels, beginning Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher is siding with Bush in a dispute with West Germany
over short-range nuclear missiles in Europe. West Germany has
demanded that the West open negotiations with the East to reduce
the number of missiles, while the United States and Britain want to
modernize the weapons.
   After the summit, and a stop in Bonn, West Germany, Bush is
scheduled to travel to London on Thursday for talks with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher had made a point of meeting with Bush during his
two terms as vice president, and following his election in November
described him as a ``worthy successor'' to Reagan.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were ideological soul mates who
operated on a first-name basis and with obvious personal warmth
during the eight years that their conservative administrations
overlapped.
   Things aren't likely to be as folksy with Bush.
   ``I don't think the chemistry's going to be there,'' said John
Young, faculty member of the London School of Economics
international history department.
   ``I think there's going to be less warmth there. I think there
was genuine mutual admiration between Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher because they are kind of believing people,'' Young said.
   ``They believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each
other for standing up and fighting ... President Bush, through his
background, is far more a wheeler-dealer kind of character,'' he
said.
   Charles H. Price II, Reagan's ambassador to Britain, predicted
Bush's relations with Mrs. Thatcher will be even closer than his
predecessor's because both are ``hands-on'' managers.
   ``I think with George Bush, in a sense, she will have a more
special relationship than Ronald Reagan had,'' Price told American
reporters before returning to the United States.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger agreed, telling
Britain's Sky Television:
   ``The relationship, good as it was between President Reagan and
Mrs. Thatcher, will be at least as good, if not better, between
President Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher.
   ``Mr. Reagan based his relationship very much on personal
intuition,'' Kissinger said. ``President Bush is a man who is more
reflective about the conceptual matters.''
   Peter Jay, Britain's ambassador to Washington from 1977-79, said
personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or
decision making.
   But he pinpointed one factor that he said could make Bush's
relations with the British leader different from Reagan's.
   ``President Bush actually knows about and is interested in
government and Mrs. Thatcher knows about and is interested in
government both at the national and international level,'' Jay said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has regularly backed the United States _ sometimes
alone.
   Britain was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles in Europe
in 1983, and it was the only ally to support the 1986 U.S. bombing
raid on Libya.
   Despite her personal reservations, Mrs. Thatcher publicly
endorsed the 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove the missiles, and
in January, Royal Air Force Base Molesworth, 50 miles north of
London, became the first NATO cruise missile base to be disarmed.
   Reagan, in turn, approved vital arms supplies and intelligence
to Britain during the 1982 Falkland Islands War against Argentina.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy during the 1980s was a study
in contrasts: the deepest recession since the Great Depression
followed by the longest peacetime economic expansion in history.
   It was a decade in which the spiraling inflation, economic
stagnation and successive oil shocks of the 1970s were replaced by
new headaches _ huge budget and trade deficits, and fears the
United States was becoming a second-rate economic power.
   It was the decade when Americans went on a spending spree,
financed by foreign capital.
   The profligacy meant that the United States, the world's richest
creditor nation at the start of the 1980s, ended up as the largest
debtor nation, facing the threat of declining living standards as
U.S. wealth moves into foreigners' hands to pay the interest.
   Reaganomics, defined in vastly different ways by friend and foe,
dominated the decade. Ronald Reagan campaigned for the presidency
on a pledge of cutting tax rates, boosting defense spending and
balancing the budget, all at the same time.
   ``Voodoo economics,'' sniffed George Bush, Reagan's competitor
for the 1980 Republican nomination. Bush was proven correct, but in
winning the presidency in 1988, Bush took his own no-new-taxes
pledge.
   He promised to boost spending on education, environmental
cleanup and the war on drugs, all without a tax increase. He
promised a balanced budget, as well. It would be accomplished with
something called a flexible freeze, but Bush never got specific
about which programs he would put on ice.
   As a consequence, the federal government recorded a $152.1
billion deficit in 1989, Bush's first year in office, more than
double the deficit in 1980, Jimmy Carter's last year as president.
   The national debt, the accumulation of all the past deficits,
had not reached $1 trillion when Reagan took office. As the decade
ended, the national debt was closing in on $3 trillion; Reagan had
piled up more red ink than all of his predecessors put together.
   Despite that, Reagan held true to his promise to cut tax rates,
persuading Congress to slash the top personal rate from 70 percent
to 33 percent.
   Reagan also succeeded in slaying the inflation dragon. As the
decade began, the country was in its worst economic predicament
since the Great Depression, a long-simmering bout of inflation
fueled by successive oil shocks that had sent consumer prices into
double-digit territory, climbing by 12.5 percent in 1980 alone.
   Paul Volcker, serving as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
used high interest rates to dampen economic growth and whip
inflation, getting support for the task from Reagan. The medicine
worked, but not before interest rates hit levels not seen since the
Civil War, devastating the housing industry and shoving the country
into the steep 1981-82 recession.
   At its depth, 12 million Americans were out of work, the
unemployment rate hit 10.8 percent, its highest level since the
Depression, and news reports focused nightly on soup lines and
crowded public shelters.
   But the hard times have been followed by 84 months of
prosperity, a period of growth unmatched in peacetime and nearly
three times longer than the average expansion period.
   While growth was slowing as 1989 ended, economists held out hope
that falling interest rates would spur a rebound in economic
activity in 1990.
   Despite the long expansion, the percentage of Americans living
in poverty refused to budge below 13 percent, remaining higher
throughout the decade than it had been at any time during the
1970s. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and the poorest
also widened to its broadest range in 40 years.
   Critics blamed the high poverty rate on holes in the ``safety
net'' that David Stockman, Reagan's budget director, had erected to
protect the neediest from the pain of government budget cuts.
   It wasn't only people on welfare who were squeezed. The income
for a typical American family last year was $32,191, which meant
that even with more two-earner households and a long expansion,
family incomes had only made it back to where they had been in 1973.
   Democrats attributed the modest income gains to the fact that
high-paying industrial jobs were being replaced by minimum-wage
jobs in the service sector, transforming the country into a
``nation of hamburger flippers.''
   Nonsense, said Republicans, who pointed to the 20 million jobs
created since the recession ended in 1982, a level of job growth
that sent unemployment down close to 5 percent, the lowest it has
been since 1973.
   The modest wage gains didn't stop Americans from going on a
spending spree. The heavy consumer purchases and the huge
government budget deficits fueled the expansion.
   The trouble was that much of the demand was met by foreign
producers, as the country's trade deficit widened to historic
levels. The broadest measure of U.S. trade was in surplus as the
decade began, deficits in merchandise trade being more than covered
by Americans' earnings on their overseas investments.
   But a huge surge of imports, spurred by a strong dollar, pushed
the current account deficit to a record $154 billion in 1987, with
only modest improvement since that time.
   The billions of dollars flowing into foreign hands came back
into the United States as a wave of investments in everything from
high-rise office buildings to Hollywood movie studios. For the
first time since 1914, U.S. investments overseas were exceeded by
foreign investments in this country, presenting a host of problems
concerning how the interest owed to foreigners will be paid.
   But still, economists saw reasons for optimism in the 1990s. The
crumbling of the communist bloc was expected to produce a ``peace
dividend'' of lower defense spending that would help the federal
government balance its books.
   In addition, many analysts were looking for the low personal
savings rates of the 1980s to begin rising in the 1990s as the Baby
Boom generation moves into middle age.
   A larger pool of savings could spell big dividends for the
United States, lowering the cost of capital and allowing American
businesses to make the investments in research and modernization
that will be needed to keep up with the Japanese and other global
competitors.

<HEAD>`Pebbles' Would Cut Cost of Space-Based Defense, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Implementing the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
space-based defense plan could reduce the $69.1 billion pricetag
attached to the early development stage of Star Wars research, says
a Pentagon official.
   Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, told members of the Senate Appropriations
defense subcommittee Thursday that Brilliant Pebbles could trim the
cost of Phase I of Star Wars. He did not provide specifics.
   The United States has invested about $17 billion in SDI,
commonly known as Star Wars, and members of the Senate panel
expressed reservations about the direction and the high price of he
research program.
   ``The members of Congress and their constituents must ask
themselves whether the nation can afford SDI and whether the return
on the investment is justified,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Inouye called current spending on Star Wars ``robust,'' and said
the $17 billion ``could have been funded in other weapons.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, criticized the research program as
``ill-defined with conflicting goals.''
   ``Ronald Reagan told us SDI is to protect people. It looks like
we're going to protect missiles,'' Harkin said.
   But Monahan sought to assure the lawmakers as he described the
Brilliant Pebbles process and the Pentagon's current plans.
   Monahan said the Defense Science Board and the Jasons, a group
of university professors, mostly physicists, will review the
concept for the department this summer.
   ``This fall, subsequent to Brilliant Pebbles study efforts ...
we will reexamine our space-based architecture with a view toward
the degree of incorporation of this concept,'' Monahan said.
   Under the system, 3,000 to 5,000 satellites, about three feet
long and weighing less than 100 pounds each, would be placed in
orbit about 400 miles above the Earth.
   Brilliant Pebbles is supported by outgoing SDI chief, Lt. Gen.
James Abrahamson, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that it
could be deployed in space for about $25 billion, far less than the
estimates of $45 billion for other SDI orbital systems.
   Monahan said recent budget cuts have forced the Pentagon to
delay work on some Star Wars research, including a six-month slip
in development of a tracking satellite and a two-year delay in a
demonstration experiment.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed cutting the fiscal
1990 budget for Star Wars from the $5.9 billion called for by
former President Reagan to $4.6 billion.
   Overall, five-year spending on Star Wars would be cut from $41
billion to $33 billion.
   In an appearance last month before the House Armed Services
Committee, Cheney said money for Star Wars ``will buy us the
capability to look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles.''
   ``If Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate
deployment date of the current space-based missile program would
slip by two years,'' Cheney said. He did not set a date.

   Chinese students said they feared being shipped
back to their homeland after the Senate upheld President Bush's
veto of a bill protecting them from deportation when their visas
expire.
   ``Many students fear they will be sent back. I'm scared for all
my friends,'' said Yuan Liu, 30, a Chinese student enrolled at
Brandeis University.
   ``I think it's a sad day for us,'' said Pei Min Xin, 33, a
doctoral student at Harvard University who led the pro-democracy
protests in Beijing last spring. ``I'm afraid that the president
will continue his policy of accommodating the Chinese dictators.''
   Bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement was unnecessary
because he has signed an administrative order allowing Chinese
students to stay in the United States.
   The president said the legislation could have damaged U.S.
relations with China, which has condemned the action and threatened
to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law.
   The Senate voted 62-37 Thursday to override the presidential
veto, four votes short of the two-thirds necessary. The House voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to reject Bush's veto.
   Xiaxia Gong, 33, a Harvard graduate student, was among several
Chinese students gathered at the China Information Center in Newton
who said the failed legislation would have given them a sense of
security.
   Many of the students fled to the United States after the Chinese
government cracked down on the protests in Tiananmen Square. Under
the visa's requirements, bearers must return to China when their
visas expire and live there for two years before they can apply for
a new one.
   The students fear that the president's order could be reversed
someday, leaving them vulnerable to deportation to their homeland
where they might be jailed.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Bush,'' Gong said. ``How can we believe
someone who has already cheated and sent high-level officials to
China when he said he would not? We don't want our destiny put in
someone else's hands.''
   In Salem, Ore., Chinese students at Oregon State University said
they couldn't understand the Senate vote.
   ``It did send a message to China, but it did not stand for human
rights,'' Wang De Qian, co-vice president of the university's
Chinese student association.
   Shu Ouang said the student association ``did not want to
override the president, but the veto. We want to send a stronger
message to the Chinese butchers.''

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Seidlitz: "Triumph of the Realists"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton's decision to renew the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] clause will have a favorable effect on 
trade and cooperation between the United States and China. This 
is the gist of a statement published by the Chinese Government 
in Beijing as a reaction. 
  The business-like statement does not reflect the overt 
triumph the Chinese Government feels. A few days before the 
fifth anniversary of the clearing of Tienanmen Square, which 
claimed at least several hundred if not thousands of lives on 4 
June 1989, the United States has now also joined those who 
follow the popular slogan of "business first." The Europeans 
assumed such a pragmatic position a long time ago. Li Peng, 
China's head of government who held his own with his tough 
course in 1989, forcing reform-minded CPC head Zhao Zhiang into 
political exile, is expected on official visits in Austria, 
Germany, and Romania. That is realpolitik. 
  President Clinton decided that trade and human rights would 
henceforth be separated. This ends the annual tug-of-war about 
the renewal of tariff privileges. One year ago, the same 
President still linked the two issues and explicitly made the 
granting of preferential trade treatment dependent on an 
improvement of the human rights situation in China and Tibet. 
  Under the pressure of Big Business, the United States has 
now 
backed out and admitted its helplessness. After all, if the 
West is not even able to intervene in the cruel massacres in 
Africa and the Balkans, exerting pressure on China, which is 
bursting with strength, is absolutely impossible. 
  The renewal of the tariff privileges means that Chinese 
consumer goods -- such as shoes, clothes, toys, electronic 
equipment -- remain cheap in the United States. The United 
States is China's biggest market. Products worth $33 billion go 
from China to the United States. Investments and trade are 
helping China to modernize the country. In the best case, this 
will in time lead to political transformation. There is no 
alternative. Nobody can wish for political chaos in the 
overpopulated country. 
  Reversely, U.S. and multinational concerns, the U.S. service 
sector enterprises such as banks and bond houses, and even 
fastfood restaurants such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
Pizza Hut, and Burger King, are now hoping for big business. So 
far, as with Japan, the United States has had a huge trade 
balance deficit with China. The United States only sells 
products worth $8 million to China. According to reports, China 
is said to order 50 Boeing aircraft in a single mammoth order 
worth $5 billion in return, so to speak, for granting the tariff 
privileges. The resumption of military contacts with the 
objective of armament sales has also been initiated. 
  The U.S. business world is, therefore, satisfied with 
President Clinton's decision. And Hong Kong rejoices, too. 
After all, the bulk of exports to China is shipped through this 
city, which will be a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong 
would have lost enormous transactions. After this political 
U-turn, the Americans argue that changes or an easing of the 
politically tense situation would be achieved through economic 
relations rather than through political pressure. The slogan is 
change through business.

<HEAD>Government Admits Controversial Groups to Its Charity Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday listed 389
charities, including several controversial ones, that will take
part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about
$160 million a year from federal workers.
   A homosexual group, the Lambda Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the
Combined Federal Campaign after initially being turned down.
   ``I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep
Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' defending
homosexuals and homosexual rights in court, said executive director
Thomas Stoddard.
   ``Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' he said. ``Being
listed helps fulfill our mission.''
   He said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the
right to participate. He said he could not anticipate how much
money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable
recipience ``may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming
out.'' The fund, with a $1 million budget, was established in 1972.
   Constance Newman, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, said that after personally reviewing rejected
applications, she approved 19 rejected organizations, gave
qualified approval to eight, left six pending and denied approval
to 55, of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional
information.
   Those given qualified approval for one year spend more than 25
percent of their receipts on administrative and fund-raising costs,
normally grounds for exclusion.
   Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially
controversial. Among them are the Firearms Civil Rights Legal
Defense Fund, the United Palestinian Appeal, Human Life
International, the National Association of Black Law Enforcement
Executives, United States Military Sports Association, the Living
Bank and Operation California.
   Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life
Educational Trust Fund, and abortion rights groups, such as the
Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund and Planned
Parenthood-World Population, already were listed. So were such
conservative groups as the National Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc., and such liberal outfits as People for the
American Way.
   Being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization
at virtually no cost _ or it can bring nothing if employees do not
specifically designate the charity.
   The fund drive raises over $160 million from 4 million federal
employees, including military people and postal workers, with the
average giving $60.68.
   It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, OPM
said, although Americans individually gave $87 billion to churches
and charities in 1988, according to the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
   Federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list
that, when local groups are included, in some instances numbers as
many as 1,000.
   About 80 percent of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, about
82 percent goes to the local United Way campaign, 7 percent to a
group of 33 international service agencies, 7 percent to national
health agencies and 4 percent to local groups, according to OPM.
   Former President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order in 1983
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare
charities. But after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups,
Congress in 1986 enacted legislation broadening the grounds for
admission but giving the OPM director discretion.

<HEAD>Reagan Says His Greatest Achievement Was Staying Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Looking back on nearly eight years as president,
Ronald Reagan said with a short, dry laugh that his greatest
achievement may have been staying alive.
   The 77-year-old U.S. chief executive, who was shot in the chest
in 1981, commented in the second of a three-part series on his
presidency broadcast Friday on British television's independent
Channel 4.
   David Gergen, former White House spokesman, said the public
attitude toward Reagan changed after the assassination attempt.
   ``You may not agree with him. You may think he's too simple .. .
not a man of the world, but there is a sense of conviction about
him,'' Gergen said. ``A strength of character emerges in the
shooting which transforms his presence.''
   The 50-minute program called ``Walking Tall'' covers Reagan's
first term.
   It starts with former aide Michael Deaver recalling that he
found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning
of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 1981.
   ``I said, `Governor.' There was kind of a grunt,'' Deaver said.
``And I said `Good God, in an hour and a half you're going to be
sworn in as the 40th president of the United States.' He rolled
over and said, `Do I have to?'.''
   Much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts
and former members of Reagan's administration.
   To Howard Baker, former White House chief of staff, ``Ronald
Reagan is the most presidential man I've ever known. That will be
his principal legacy. And by that I mean he knows exactly who he
is. He is president of the United States and he has no trouble with
that. He is not offended by it, upset by it or intimidated by it.''
   Stuart Spencer, a long-time adviser, said: ``Nobody in American
politics has better style and form than Ronald Reagan.''
   Howard Philips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus political
group, called him ``the most typical, the most American, the most
average _ but in a good sense, in a likeable sense _ president we
could ever imagine.''
   The president's policies of increasing defense spending, cutting
social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough
criticism.
   Reagan was asked how he responded to the fact that he never
balanced the budget and the United States now is the world's
biggest debtor nation.
   ``I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here,'' he
replied.
   Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and chief of staff, said
the president never discussed economics or finance with him. Regan
said Congress made budget cuts almost impossible.
   David Stockman, the former budget director who urged Reagan to
raise taxes, had a harsh assessment:
   ``After time, when the full extent of the damage is clear, and
the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident,
historians will record Reaganomics as the singular greatest episode
of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th century history of
the United States.''
   Regan called that ``sour grapes on the part of David Stockman''
and added: ``He never got what he wanted, which was solely to have
taxes raised. ... That was not an antidote to get us out of
recession'' in 1982.
   Some of the first term's major events were shown, including the
assassination attempt, the October 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine
barracks in Beirut that killed 243 military personnel and the
invasion of Grenada two days later.
   Recalling the assassination attempt, Reagan said: ``I heard what
I thought was firecrackers. ... I didn't feel a bullet hit me.''
   When asked what was his greatest achievement, he said:
``Sometimes I think,'' then laughed and continued, ``just staying
alive.''
   Even Reagan's critics praised his ability to control the media.
   ``These people have understood that they have a powerful
instrument of news management in their hand,'' said Richard
Neustadt, a Harvard University professor and author of
``Presidential Power,'' who described Reagan's mastery of the photo
opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences.

<HEAD>Group Of 7 To Act Against Terrorists, Help Debtor Nations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leading industrial democracies plan to
take joint steps against terrorism and to assist Third World debtor
nations at their eocnomic summit next week in Toronto.
   Exercising the ``no-place-to-hide'' doctrine, the United States
and its six partners are expected to call on nations worldwide to
deny refueling to airplane hijackers, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Wednesday.
   The idea is to prevent hostage-holders from taking off with
their victims, Shultz said in a U.S. Information Agency telecast
and at a White House news conference.
   ``It's a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be
helpful,'' he said.
   Shultz said joint action at past economic summit meetings had
helped send terrorism into a decline in Western Europe, although he
said there also were indications it might be on the rise elsewhere.
   Sharing the White House platform with Shultz, Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III predicted ``there's going to be real action on
economic issues,'' including decisions to ease the debt burden of
sub-Saharan African nations.
   Also, Baker said President Reagan and the leaders of Canada,
Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany would consider
cooperative measures to prevent drug dealers from laundering their
profits through legitimate banks and ways for governments to share
intelligence information on narcotics.
   On another front, however, Shultz indicated the United States
would resist any attempt to impose stiffer economic sanctions
against South Africa because of its racial policies.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Friday that
Oliver North was the ``scapegoat'' for crimes committed by the U.S.
government and the person who really should be tried is former
President Reagan.
   North was convicted Thursday of three felony counts in
connection with the Iran-Contra case, which shadowed the last two
years of the Reagan administration.
   Ortega, on a swing through Western Europe, also told a news
conference that he hoped to improve relations with Washington.
   ``Oliver North has become the scapegoat for the crimes committed
by the government of the United States against Nicaragua,'' Ortega
said.
   ``But who was behind the actions of Oliver North? Who was the
boss of Oliver North? Who promoted the policy followed by Oliver
North? He's called Ronald Reagan. The person who ought to be
standing in the dock is Ronald Reagan, not Oliver North.
   Ortega also said President Bush ``seems clearly to have been
mixed up in these crimes.''
   He said his government had ``hopes and optimism'' that the
United States would change its policies toward Nicaragua.
Washington has maintained an economic embargo against the country
in addition to backing the Contras.
   Ortega is on a 10-nation tour to win economic aid for his
country's battered economy and to enlist Western European help in
persuading the United States to normalize relations with Nicaragua.
   He avoided questions about whether he had received promises of
aid from the countries he has visited thus far: Italy, Greece,
Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and France.

<HEAD>Residents Of Conservative County Like Gorbachev More Than Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to recast, include survey question on world
leaders; Picks up 6th graf, `The message ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev edged
President Bush in a survey of opinions toward world leaders in
Republican-dominated Orange County, but both ran behind British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan, according to
a poll released today.
   The Los Angeles Times-sponsored survey of Orange County residents
also revealed that 45 percent think the Cold War between the
superpowers is coming to an end.
   The results came in the county that gave Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan their largest margins of victory of any U.S.
county in the presidential elections of 1980, 1984 and 1988.
   Asked, ``Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of these
world leaders,'' positive ratings were as follows: 79 percent for
Mrs. Thatcher, 76 percent for Reagan, 70 percent for Gorbachev, 67
percent for Bush and 21 percent for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The poll, which involved 600 adults in the county southeast of
Los Angeles, had a 4 percentage point margin of error, the newspaper
said.
   ``The message is that Orange County is more in the mainstream of
American thinking than the perception,'' said longtime Reagan
adviser Stu Spencer. ``Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is
changing due to Ronald Reagan's policies.''
   The poll, taken Jan. 13-17 by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of
Irvine, also found that more Orange County residents see Japan and
the Third World as a threat to the United States than the Soviet
Union and China.
   Thirty-one percent said the Third World presented the greatest
threat to the future of the United States. Just 17 percent said the
Soviet Union presents the greatest threat, while 6 percent felt
China was the greatest threat.
   On the issues of abortion, AIDS education and pornography, Orange
County residents again showed a softening of their perceived
conservative tendencies.
   Sixty percent opposed a Supreme Court ban on abortions and 56
percent opposed a ban on the rental of X-rated films at video stores.
   Regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 82 percent favored
teaching youngsters in public schools about the use of condoms as a
means of controlling the spread of the deadly AIDS virus.

<HEAD>U.S. Gives Boats to Fight Cocaine Smuggling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin
Meese III handed over to this island's military authorities two
speed boats to be used to fight drug trafficking.
   The long, sleek boats were confiscated from traffickers trying
to smuggle cocaine into the United States, U.S. officials said.
They can reach speeds of 65 mph.
   Smugglers use this Caribbean island nation as a transit point
for cocaine from South America bound for the United States.
   ``The Dominican Republic seems to be determined ... that
narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' Meese told
Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, the armed forces minister, on
Wednesday.
   Meese spoke on the first day of a five-nation Latin American
tour. He arrived by Air Force jet and was due to leave Santo
Domingo today for Bogota, Colombia. Meese also will visit Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia.
   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the
neighboring islands of Jamaica and Puerto Rico tightened
surveillance of boats and planes.
   President Joaquin Balaguer, elected to a fifth term in May 1986,
has made the war on drugs a top priority. In December 1986, the
Dominican air force shot down a small plane that did not identify
itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds
of pounds of cocaine.
   In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine
shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at millions of
dollars. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran
the patrol boats of the Dominican coast guard.
   ``These (confiscated boats) are going to put the Dominican
Republic one step ahead of the smugglers,'' said one U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while
trying to smuggle drugs into the United States, he said.
   One is a 31-foot Chris Craft Scorpion with twin 235 horsepower
Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he
said. The value of the boats, delivered from Florida by U.S. Coast
Guard C-130s, was not disclosed.
   The United States also plans to supply five small, twin-engined
Cessnas to the Dominican air force under the Military Assistance
Program.
   Accompanying Meese were his wife, Ursula; the chief of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, John Lawn; Frank Keating, the Treasury
Department's assistant secretary for enforcement; Mark Dion, the
State Department's deputy assistant secretary; and Mike Skol,
director of State's Office of Andean Affairs.
   On Wednesday, Meese met with Balaguer at the National Palace,
then with Foreign Affairs Minister Donald Reid Cabral.

   Iran told the Security Council today that
the United States committed a ``barbaric crime'' in shooting down
an Iranian airliner and denied U.S. claims that the Navy warned the
jetliner before the attack.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati, in an angry speech,
accused the United States of a premeditated attack on the airliner
with 290 people aboard and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.
   ``This was the most inhuman military attack in the history of
civil aviation,'' he said.
   He accused the United States of ``arrogance, indifference and a
campaign of lies ... to justify this barbaric crime at any cost...
   ``This was a premeditated act of aggression against the
integrity of Tehran ... a massacre,'' he said.
   Vice President George Bush called the accident a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but told the Security Council that Iran shares the
responsibility.
   ``The critical issue is not the how and why of Iran Air 655,''
Bush said. ``It is the continuing refusal of the government of Iran
to comply with (a U.N. cease-fire resolution), to negotiate an end
to the war with Iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against
neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.''
   He said Iran ``allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle.
That was irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   The meeting was requested by Iran, which sought a condemnation
of the United States. It adjourned after Velayati and Bush spoke
and was scheduled to resume Friday.
   Iran also sought a condemnation of the United States from the
governing council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The council agreed today in Montreal that the world body should
investigate the incident, but only four of the 33 members _ China,
the Soviet Union, Cuba and Czechoslovakia _ spoke in favor of U.S
condemnation.
   Diplomats said the 15-member Security Council was not in
agreement on a resolution or statement that would be acceptable to
all parties and would not be vetoed by the United States. As one of
the council's five permanent members, the United States has veto
power.
   Velayati quoted the radio transcript of recordings between
Flight 655 and control towers and said it shows that, contrary to
the U.S. version, the plane never received warnings from the
Vincennes on July 3.
   ``It was traveling in an established civilian air corridor and
transmitting an internationally recognized signal to identify
itself ... Claiming mistaken identity is absurd,'' Velayati said.
   He rebutted U.S. claims that the plane was descending in an
attack mode, that it was transmitting ambiguous civilian and
military signals and that it was outside a recognized air corridor.
   The Navy said the cruiser's crew mistook the A300 Airbus for a
fighter jet and the plane ignored radioed warnings.
   Velayati said the council should compel the United States and
all foreign forces to leave the gulf.``Anything less would be a
further evasion of responsibilitry by the Security Council.''
   The appearance of Bush, a former U.N. ambassador, was considered
a major gesture of hopes for better relations with Iran after
nearly nine years of hostility. A U.S. vice president has not
addressed the council in years.
   Bush was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under former
President Richard Nixon from 1971 to 1973. This is believed to be
his first appearance at the U.N. since. President Reagan has
appeared six times.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied any political
motivation for the appearance by Bush, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``The vice president does not normally appear before the
Security Council and in this way we can again highlight our
position,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States already has expressed deep regret for the
attack and promised compensation to the families of the victims,
but not to the Iranian government.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in
November 1979 after Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage, holding them for more
than a year.
   But both Iran and the United States clearly want to avoid a
bitter public confrontation in the Security Council, and both sides
have been restrained in their statements here and elsewhere.
   The United States has backed off from its call for the council
to impose a mandatory, global arms embargo against Iran.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said that before the
airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sent probes about
opening a dialogue with the United States.
   In Tehran, the No. 2 leader, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, has urged moderation and restraint and opposed violent
retaliation for the U.S. attack. He previously has said Iran must
stop offending the international community, end its isolation and
gain political friends and trading partners.

presidential contest, but if it were up to the 36,000 Poles who
cast ballots in North America he'd already be in office.
   ``He is the only man for the job,'' St. Louis cab driver
Alexander Gorka said Sunday. ``He can take the country out of the
critical situation it's in.''
   Walesa, the Solidarity leader who led the revolt against four
decades of Communist rule in Poland, got 60 percent of the vote
among Poles in Canada and the United States who voted Saturday,
said Consul Andrezj Jaroszynski in Chicago.
   Citing unofficial figures, he said Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki placed second with 33 percent of the ballots cast by
36,006 voters in North America.
   Upstart emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who beat
Mazowiecki for second in voting in Poland, had about 3 percent of
the North American vote.
   In Poland, Walesa had just under 40 percent of the vote with 44
of 49 provinces reporting. Tyminski, with 23 percent, made a
surprise showing by beating Mazowiecki, who had 16 percent of the
vote. Three other candidates trailed far behind. Final results were
expected later today.
   A Dec. 9 runoff will be held between the two top vote-getters if
neither wins an outright majority.
   Gorka, who drove from St. Louis to the Polish Consulate in
Chicago to vote, said he cried when he cast his ballot for Walesa,
who had been favored to win.
   ``It was such an important day for me,'' Gorka said. ``It was
the first time in my life I had the freedom to vote in a truly
democratic election in Poland.''
   Turnout was lower than expected in Chicago, where only 9,810 of
more than 40,000 eligible voters went to three polling places,
Jaroszynski said.
   The metropolitan area has a larger bloc of Poles and
Polish-Americans, a total of 800,000 to 1.2 million, than any
municipality outside Warsaw.
   More than 16,000 ballots were cast in New York state, according
to the consulate in New York City.
   Alderman Roman C. Pucinski, a Walesa supporter, said returns in
Chicago, especially in the heavily Polish 41st ward he represents,
show Walesa ``does get his strength from the blue collar workers.''
   In Chicago, Walesa got 76 percent of the vote to Mazowiecki's 18
percent.
   Unofficial North American results showed Walesa with 21,608, or
60 percent; Mazowiecki with 11,823, or 33 percent; Tyminski with
1,238, or 3 percent; and the remainder for the other three
candidates, Jaroszynski said.
   Poland allows naturalized U.S. citizens to hold Polish passports
and vote. Newly arrived immigrants and visitors to the United
States also could vote. Balloting was at sites in North America on
Saturday; voting by mail was not permitted.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushing for Foreign Investment Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in the United States is
expected to accelerate dramatically this year, but the true scope
of overseas ownership remains hidden, a congressional critic
complains.
   ``We need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself
in key areas of our economy _ energy, steel, banking _ whether
foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the American
economy,'' says Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
   Bryant came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a
provision of the 1,000-page trade bill approved by the House. It
would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure
required of foreign investors.
   Lawmakers eventually dropped Bryant's heavily debated plan in an
unsuccessful effort to win President Reagan's approval. And it is
not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate.
   But Bryant is still pushing legislation to require foreign
owners to register their major U.S. assets with the Commerce
Department, including business, industrial, real estate and farm
holdings.
   The Reagan administration opposes his bill because ``they don't
want to look like the folks that gave away the store,'' the Dallas
Democrat said.
   Prospects for getting the bill to the president's desk this year
are not especially bright, but Bryant vows not to give up.
   To bolster his case, he cites a private study released last week
showing foreign ownership in the United States more than tripled
since 1980.
   The Congressional Economic Leadership Institute said foreign
investors own about 33 percent of prime commercial real estate in
Washington, D.C., 46 percent in Los Angeles, and 39 percent in
Houston.
   It said they own 10 percent of the U.S. manufacturing base, hold
a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics
industries, and a significant portion in machine tools, chemicals
and auto parts.
   Nearly 3 million Americans are employed full or part-time as a
result of foreign investment, the study said.
   It acknowledged, however, that foreign investments still account
for no more than 5 percent to 6 percent of U.S. assets.
   Bryant said it is ``foolhardy'' to believe foreign investors
will avoid the United States if they must register their holdings
because ``every other country collects careful data'' without
scaring off business.
   Nancy LeaMond, president of the institute, said: ``In our
innermost circle of trading partners, we are the only nation that
swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every
investment.''
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and former Cabinet
official Elliot Richardson claim Bryant's bill is anti-competitive.
   Richardson testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that
it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher U.S.
interest rates and an economic slowdown.
   Richardson called the reporting requirements burdensome. He said
sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies
and that investors would have to reveal business secrets.
   In its study, the institute said an ``unprecedented transfer of
American assets to foreign control is under way.''
   Since 1980, foreign direct investment in the United States
expanded by more than 215 percent, while American investment abroad
jumped by one-fifth that rate, the study said.
   Foreign buy-outs are expected to make up as much as 20 percent
of U.S. acquisitions this year, up from 5 percent in 1987, said the
study, which based its findings on the latest available data from
the Commerce Department and other sources.

   Iraq today ordered 33-year-old reservists
to report for military duty, its third major call-up of reserves in
recent weeks.
   The ruling Revolutionary Command Council also issued a statement
of defiance on Kuwait, saying it wanted peace but would not cave in
to demands by the United States and its allies.
   The council said it rejected American attempts to impose a date
for a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. The two sides have been unable to agree on a date for
Baker to visit Baghdad.
   Baghdad newspapers reported the Ministry of Defense has recalled
men born in 1957 to bolster the mobilization of almost 500,000
soldiers already in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Saddam said on Nov. 19 he would send 250,000 men - seven new
divisions, apparently drawn from reserve forces, and 150,000
reservists and draftees.
   The move came after President Bush announced U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf would be increased by about 200,000 - to almost
450,000 military personnel in the region - by early January.
   Since then, Iraq has recalled about 60,000 reservist farmers and
an unknown number of others aged 30, 31 and 32.
   Iraq has a force of 500,000 regular soldiers and 480,000
reserves, the sixth largest army in the world. The country of 17
million has about 900,000 men aged 18 to 22 and 1.3 million aged 23
to 32, according to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   The newspaper reports said recruiting offices had informed them
that the 33-year-olds, should report to their units in a week. The
number of affected men was not known.
   Iraq usually recalls its reserves through statements read over
state television and radio. There was no explanation why that
procedure was not followed this time.
   After the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, a U.S.-led multinational
force assembled in the gulf to confront Iraq. A U.N. resolution has
authorized the use of force to liberate Kuwait unless Iraq
withdraws its troops by Jan. 15.
   Iraq had suggested that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz travel to
Washington today for talks there, and that Baker come to Baghdad on
Jan. 12.
   The United States rejected that date, saying it was too close to
the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face military action.
   The Revolutionary Command Council, which is headed by Saddam,
issued a statement broadcast over Baghdad radio saying:
   ``We seek peace. We want dialogue for the sake of peace. We
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international
law on the nation's causes. However, we reject capitulation.''
   It said the Iraqi leaders ``reject the unilateral imposition of
dates as the president of the U.S.A. wishes vis-a-vis the dialogue
to which he agreed.''
   The statement said Iraq was not afraid of the ``fleets and
forces of oppression.''

<TEXT>
   The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance handily defeated the governing Christian
Democrats in legislative and municipal elections this week,
election officials announced.
   The defeat presented President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the
staunchest U.S. ally in Central America, with the prospect of an
uphill climb in his final year in office. Presidential elections
are set for March 1989.
   Mario Samayoa, the president of the Central Elections Council,
told journalists ``more than 50 percent'' of the votes cast on
Sunday went to the alliance, known by its Spanish acronym of Arena.
He declined to be more specific, saying complete returns would be
ready shortly.
   The announcement Monday of a majority for Arena signaled a
triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted.
   They had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60-seat National Assembly,
which the centrist Christian Democrats controlled with 33 seats.
   Arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber.
The party predicted it would have 35. Local media projected 33-35
seats for the rightists. The Christian Democrats were expected to
get about 22 seats.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of
violence to cast ballots. The guerrillas said the elections were
illegitimate, contending that free and fair elections could not be
held in wartime.
   Washington sent El Salvador almost $600 million in military and
economic aid last year, more than the amount given to any country
in the hemisphere.
   Arena candidate Armado Calderon Sol, a 39-year-old lawyer, won
the mayor's race in San Salvador, the capital and home to 1.5
million of the country's 5 million people. Calderon Sol defeated
Christian Democratic candidate Alejandro Duarte, the president's
son.
   Samayoa said Arena won most of the rest of the country's
municipalities.
   Arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with
the Christian Democrats. Duarte won the presidency in 1984 on a
platform of ending the war and improving the Salvadoran economy.
   The 8-year-old war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40
percent and annual inflation is estimated at nearly 40 percent.
   Arena's campaign slogan was ``Change for the Better.''
   Arena President Alfredo Cristiani, who kept his assembly seat,
told The Associated Press his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature,
including how to wage the war.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.
   He indicated that Arena, which has considerable support and good
connections with military officers, would work to step up
offensives against the rebels.
   ``This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said,
referring to smaller-scale, U.S.-backed counterinsurgency tactics
that have been adopted by the Salvadoran army.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed El Salvador's
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who led an observer team named by
President Reagan, called the election honest and important
``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels didn't
win.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked whether the
Reagan administration had any reservations about a rightist
victory, said that ``we don't choose sides in these kinds of
elections.''
   The fiercely nationalistic Arena was formed in 1981, with
retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson its founder. D'Aubuisson has
strongly criticized the United States and is considered the driving
force behind early 1980s death-squads.

   The Soviet Union's popularity has soared in the
United States since the last superpower summit, and Americans
increasingly support U.S. military cuts to reflect the lessened
tensions, a survey found.
   As President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepare
to meet in Washington this week, the national Media
General-Associated Press poll found both leaders continuing to
command great popularity among Americans.
   Gorbachev slipped only slightly from his overall rating in a
similar poll before the last summit in December, even though a
third of the respondents now think less highly of him because of
his crackdown on Lithuania.
   Most striking in the new survey were growing expressions of good
will toward America's old Cold War foe. Forty-one percent of the
respondents said they held favorable views of the Soviet Union,
well up from 24 percent last November and 15 percent in a 1987
survey.
   Fourteen percent of the respondents in the new poll had
unfavorable opinions of the Soviet Union, and 41 percent had a
neutral view.
   In another measure of growing trust, a relatively low 29 percent
believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world. That fear factor
stood at 35 percent last November and 50 percent in a CBS News-New
York Times poll a year ago.
   The new Media General-AP survey was conducted by telephone May
11-20 among a random sample of 1,143 adults across the country. It
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The summit starts Wednesday amid continuing upheaval in the
communist world. Gorbachev is pushing reforms of the Soviet system
while struggling to contain independence movements in some of the
Soviet republics. His Eastern European allies, once viewed as
puppets, largely have abandoned communism.
   Possibly because of Gorbachev's difficulties, the survey found
some sense that the initiative in superpower relations has shifted
to Bush. In November, 41 percent said Gorbachev was doing more than
Bush to reduce tensions, but in the new survey that fell to 33
percent.
   At the same time, those saying Bush was doing more to ease
tensions rose from 29 percent in November to 38 percent now. The
rest were unsure.
   Similarly, 54 percent said Bush was doing enough to encourage
Soviet reforms _ up from 46 percent in November _ and 33 percent
said he was being too cautious, down from 40 percent in November.
Again the rest were unsure.
   In view of the lessened tensions, 50 percent in the new survey
said the United States should reduce its military spending
significantly, up from 41 percent who favored such cuts last
November.
   Additionally, nearly four in 10 said the United States should
immediately begin reducing its forces in Western Europe. While
still a minority, that was up from 25 percent in November.
   The poll found some lingering suspicion of the Soviets. Half
said the Soviet Union cannot be trusted to live up to arms control
agreements _ about the same as in November, but down from 61
percent a year ago.
   On Lithuania, 46 percent said the breakaway Baltic republic
should back off from its claim of independence from the Soviet
Union and hold negotiations, while 31 percent said it should push
its claim. The rest had no opinion.
   But there was support for gradual independence for the Baltic
states. Fifty-seven percent favored the actions of Lithuania and
Latvia, which have claimed independence, while just 8 percent
favored the actions of Estonia, which wants independence but has
not formally claimed it.
   Gorbachev has responded to Lithuania's claim by denying it
shipments of oil and other supplies. While 34 percent said the
embargo has made them think less highly of Gorbachev, 48 percent
said it had not changed their view.
   Overall, 63 percent had a favorable impression of Gorbachev and
69 percent held a favorable view of Bush. As in earlier surveys,
Gorbachev outpolled Bush, 79-68 percent, among the best-educated
respondents, those with postgraduate schooling.
   An overwhelming 75 percent of all respondents approved of the
way Bush is handling relations with the Soviet Union.

   Today's highlight in history:
   On October 8, 1871, one of America's worst urban fires and
forest fires broke out in Chicago and Peshtigo, Wisc. The Chicago
fire claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed more than 17,000
buildings. The Wisconsin blaze claimed an estimated 1,500 lives and
scorched 1.28 million acres of timberland.
   On this date:
   In 1869, the 14th president of the United States, Franklin
Pierce, died in Concord, N.H.
   In 1918, Sergeant Alvin C. York almost single-handedly killed 25
German soldiers and captured 132 in the Argonne Forest in France.
   In 1934, Bruno Hauptmann was indicted for murder in the death of
the infant son of Charles A. Lindbergh.
   In 1939, the New York Yankees won the World Series in four games
straight, defeating the Cincinnati Reds, 7-4.
   In 1944, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its debut
on CBS radio, an event that coincided with Ozzie and Harriet
Nelson's ninth wedding anniversary.
   In 1945, President Truman announced that the secret of the
atomic bomb would be shared only with Britain and Canada.
   In 1956, Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game ever in a
World Series as the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers, 2-0.
   In 1957, the Brooklyn Baseball Club announced it was accepting
an offer to move the Dodgers from New York to Los Angeles.
   In 1970, exiled Soviet author Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn was

   In 1982, the government of Poland banned all labor
organizations, including Solidarity.
   Ten years ago: Pope John Paul II returned to Rome, having
wrapped up a nine-day journey to Ireland and the United States.
   Five years ago: In an address to the U.N. General Assembly, the
president of El Salvador, Jose Napoleon Duarte unexpectedly offered
to hold peace talks with leftist guerrillas.
   One year ago: Pope John Paul II journeyed to eastern France,
where he addressed the Council of Europe and the European Court of
Human Rights.
   Today's Birthdays: Senator Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, is 73.
Entertainment reporter Rona Barrett is 53. Actor David Carradine is

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

   Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in
the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have
deserted him.
   On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained
assault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers
Cuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.
   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy
opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of
corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the
hemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries
_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government _ seem to have misfired.
   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial than
his style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectual
combat than he has.
   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.
A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He's
untrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.
   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,
using a stronger noun.
   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with
people who disagree with him.
   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The opposition
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally
hard.''
   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,
as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.
   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small
children (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late at

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

   Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in
the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have
deserted him.
   On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained
assault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers
Cuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.
   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy
opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of
corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the
hemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries
_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government _ seem to have misfired.
   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial than
his style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectual
combat than he has.
   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.
A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He's
untrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.
   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,
using a stronger noun.
   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with
people who disagree with him.
   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The opposition
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally
hard.''
   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,
as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.
   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small
children (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late at
night, he can be found curled up with a novel. But, during working
hours, it's the combat zone.
   The combat zone was livelier than usual during the Iran-Contra
hearings last year. It developed that Abrams had earlier misled
Congressional committees about fund solicitations for the Contras
and U.S. involvement in an ill-fated resupply flight for the
