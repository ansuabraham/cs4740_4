 [By Bruce Gilley] 
  [Text] New York has the Statue of Liberty, Paris has the 
Eiffel Tower, now Shanghai will have its own imposing monument 
to symbolise China in the 21st century. 
  When the statue, tentatively called "China Colossus", is 
finished around the year 2000, it will be 118 metres high, twice 
the size of its New York counterpart, according to Xie Lin, of 
the city's statues commission. 
  But comparisons with the Liberty Island lady, which ran 
rampant in the Shanghai press after the decision was made this 
week, were not being encouraged. "In terms of meaning, ours 
will be completely different from the Statue of Liberty," Xie 
said. 
  "The China Colossus will be a profound symbol of the Chinese 
nation, symbolising the reform and opening policies of our 
powerful country at the onset of a new century." Like its New 
York counterpart, it would be likely to be a woman, but other 
human representations could also be considered, Xie said. 
  An exact replica, as was erected by students in Tiananmen 
Square five years ago, was "impossible", Xie said. 
  Xie said arguments were still raging about cost-sharing 
between the central and local governments and some political 
questions concerning the design. "Experts from the central 
government have many ideas. This is not something we can decide 
in a flash," he said. 
  Xie said it might be premature for him to even talk about 
the 
choice of Shanghai, a decision made while Beijing's statues 
group was in the city this week. "I can't disclose which 
departments in the central government are in charge. But they 
feel this matter is not ready for public announcement," he said. 
  But he could not restrain his enthusiasm over the city's 
success in winning the statue. Guangdong province had been the 
front runner when the central government first began secret 
discussions about erecting a "symbol of rising China" last 
November. 
  "We will have to draw on all the experience of thousands of 
Chinese sculptors around the world for this solemn task," he 
said. Nor could the city's press refrain from a little chest 
thumping after the supposedly secret conclave on the statue left 
town this week. 
  "Standing aloft in Shanghai will soon be a statue of 118 
metres, twice as high as America's Statue of Liberty," the 
Shanghai Labour Daily said. Beijing leaders are understood to 
be angry at the reporting of the statue in Shanghai before the 
official New China News Agency (Xinhua) was informed. 
  "Beijing will have the final say on what the statue looks 
like and where it stands, not Shanghai," one Shanghai official 
said. 
  Present plans call for the statue to be built up-river of 
Shanghai proper along the Huangpu River, the official said. 
This would avoid any charge that the statue was incompatible 
with the traditional architecture of the Bund. 
  It would also ensure that China's newest symbol is not 
diminished by the 450-metre Oriental Pearl television tower, 
which is already halfway to the skies across the river in the 
Pudong new area.

PICK OF THE WEEK 




The Friends of the Pomona Public Library will sponsor a 100th birthday party 
for Goddess Pomona, the Roman marble statue presented to the city in 1889 by 
the Rev. C. F. Loop, a pioneer horticulturist in the Pomona Valley. 


The celebration will be from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday at the library, 625 S. Garey 
Ave., site of the 5-foot-tall statue. 


Looking at the statue, left, is Vanessa Chatigny, 14. 


In 1888 Loop was visiting the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, when he saw 
the original statue, which had been unearthed from among the ruined temples and 
palaces of the Mediterranean, where it had lain buried for centuries. 


Since Loop's hometown was named after the goddess, he decided to have the 
figure copied, and contracted with Italian sculptor Adolph Cipriani to make a 
replica. The cost of the replica, including transportation to Pomona, was 
$10,000.

CRITIC AT LARGE: LIGHT OF LIBERTY IN ANOTHER TIME OF CRISIS 




By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 




Early last Sunday morning, with a bright sun burning off the last of a ground 
haze, our cruise ship sailed past the Statue of Liberty on our way into New 
York harbor. 


Nothing, not all the stills, newsreels, television documentaries, not the 
finale of Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur," entirely prepares you for the size of 
the statue. Even seen across half a mile of open water, she is enormous, a 
stunning green goddess beckoning to us and seeming to glow as the sunlight 
catches her. 


Hundreds of us crowded the railings and sufficient film was being shot to 
provide extra dividends at Kodak and Fuji. It was a perfect hour to catch sight 
of the statue. There was the warm, clear promise of the day and, despite all, 
the promise of a new life that the statue has stood for all these years. 


I have no doubt that the passage produced a mix of emotions -- a tangle of 
emotions is probably more like it -- in all of us. My own feelings were touched 
not least by the memory of my first sailing into the harbor past the lady with 
the torch. 


That had been 45 years ago on an April morning in 1945. I didn't get to see the 
statue on that voyage. I was in a bunk deep below decks on the Queen Elizabeth, 
which had been fitted out as a hospital ship. The captain's resonant British 
voice on the intercom had told us where we were. So last Sunday morning was a 
pleasure long delayed. 


A little later on that earlier April morning the captain came on the intercom 
again, this time to say, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to tell you 
that your President, Franklin Roosevelt, died this morning at Warm Springs, 
Georgia." There was, I remember, a long silence and then a voice that I would 
have placed in Brooklyn said, "Harry Truman." I'd been so immersed in being an 
infantry private I don't think I could have said who the vice president was. 


So that 1945 morning had had its own mix of emotions, the relief at getting 
home from the war in one only temporarily damaged piece, the uncertainties of a 
war not yet over, the dismay at losing a leader I had worshiped (whatever some 
of the Upstate elders I knew thought of him). 


The arrival and the docking last Sunday morning was in another time of crisis, 
and it had been more unsettling than comforting to have spent the days largely 
beyond the reach of daily newspapers and the more frequent fixes of radio and 
television. 


World War II had been radio's finest news hours, and the voices of Elmer Davis, 
William L. Shirer, Edward R. Murrow, even peppery H. V. Kaltenborn and other 
less celebrated readers and correspondents, echo in memory. Yet it was a kind 
of revelation at sea to appreciate how accustomed we have all become to the 
instantaneous visual information from television and the amazing feats of both 
immediacy and depth that the newspapers now achieve. 


On an earlier port stop I'd telephoned a journalist friend in Washington. I 
said it had given me a sense of unreality to feel so detached from events. If 
you have a sense of unreality, my waggish friend said, you belong in the higher 
reaches of the Bush Administration. 


If we had lost hourly contact with the breaking news in the Middle East, we had 
been in touch with the longer reaches of American history during port stops. 
There had been earlier sail-bys of Ft. Sumter, where the Civil War began, and 
Ft. McHenry, whose bombardment inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The 
Star-Spangled Banner." 


On Saturday I had walked the historic precincts of Philadelphia, pausing at the 
grave of Benjamin Franklin in Christ Church burying ground, where several 
signers of the Declaration of Independence take their rest. It is a shady oasis 
where the weathers have eroded the inscriptions from most of the stones and the 
living world seems farther away than it is. 


Beyond the old brick walls, indeed, there are the carriage rides and the tour 
buses, the hoagie vendors and the fretful small fry tugging at skirts and 
demanding to go. Yet for all of it -- and maybe, at that, because of the 
throngs -- the old buildings are somehow more than political mausoleums. You 
still sense the ghostly presences of those philosopher-activists, contentious 
among themselves as they often were, who codified our dreams of individual 
freedom, tolerance and self-determination, and who set us on our way. 


What they would make of our day I'm not sure. I suspect that only Thomas 
Jefferson and Ben Franklin himself, inventors both, would not be amazed by all 
the technological wizardries we take for granted. They might, on the other 
hand, be made melancholy to contemplate the priority that material things have 
taken over the abstract notion of liberty they held so dear. 


Wandering through the Friends Meeting House where the life of William Penn, 
that devout believer in nonviolence, is celebrated, and where a loving 
simplicity is the desideratum, it was possible to feel just such a melancholy. 


After all the courage and the sacrifices in war by generations of brave men and 
women, there are, as Stephen Vincent Benet said in a fine poem, "still the 
tyrants and the kings." 


Looking back across the four-plus decades to my first sail past the Statue of 
Liberty, I couldn't help thinking -- again and gratefully -- what a clear-cut 
war I'd been in. No amount of revisionist thinking can explain away the clear 
and present danger that the Axis powers represented to the ideas of tolerance, 
individual dignity and freedom of choice. 


In the mix of emotions Sunday morning was a strong dose of "Here we go again." 
Liberty is still at risk from tyranny; the detailings may differ, but the root 
scenario is unchanged. 


Yet there have been recent times when the world as a whole has seemed to learn 
from all its bloodyings and its butcherings. Such hope as you could find on a 
bright Sunday was that a whole context of lessons had been learned, one being 
that tyranny is unacceptable, another being that collective firmness works 
better than appeasement (a lesson from 1776 as well as 1939). 


One way and another, it seemed curiously timely to have strolled through the 
American past in Philadelphia, to have saluted that glorious statue in the 
harbor and to have been reminded that the country, uniquely, was born of ideals 
of personal freedom that are relevant now as ever.

HOT CORNER FOR MEMORIES; 


MARKET RIPE FOR ANNIVERSARY SERIES OF BASEBALL STATUES 




By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN, Zimmerman, a View copy editor, won't tell his wife how 
much he paid for his original Willie Mays. 




World Series mania might be over until next season but some fans are taking 
their enthusiasm into extra innings. 


William K. Alley, president of Hartland Plastics in Hartland, Wis., says there 
has been a "tremendous rash of orders" for the company's 25th anniversary 
series of statues of such immortals as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Ted 
Williams. 


"The company is behind in the initial orders," he said. "We're playing 
catch-up." 


Alley, an attorney who has "two kids at the baseball age," bought the company 1 
1/2 years ago as "a fun thing." 


"I really want to rejuvenate the craftsmanship-workmanship aspect of this," he 
said. "The company has about 20 workers who hand-make, hand-paint and 
hand-assemble about 500 statues a day -- an exact reproduction under the 
direction of Frank Fulop, the original designer." 


It was their quality that set the 7- to 8-inch-tall originals apart from most 
memorabilia of the '50s and early '60s. 


Hartland Plastics, a contract manufacturer for other companies, added the 
baseball player statues as a product line, at Fulop's suggestion, to fill in 
slack periods between job orders. The firm hired local sculptors to go to 
Milwaukee Braves games to sketch players who had signed royalty deals with 
Hartland. Not surprisingly, the first players cast were Eddie Mathews, Henry 
Aaron and Warren Spahn. 


Hartland's original statues -- made from 1958 to 1963 -- are favorites among 
collectors of baseball memorabilia. They merit two classified column headings 
in Sports Collectors Digest, the enthusiasts' bible. 


In one ad, $165 is asked for a Mathews statue, in another, a Nellie Fox with 
the original box is priced at $395. A mint-condition Dick Groat, which had a 
run of only about 5,000 statues, can bring $500 or more. The 18 players in the 
series originally sold for $3.95 to $5.95. 


The company abandoned its line of figurines in 1963, switching to makeup 
compact cases for a cosmetics firm. 


Bob Lemke, the publisher of Sports Collectors Digest, is one serious collector 
who is happy that the firm is making the reproductions. 


"The original statues are priced out of the range of most collectors," he said. 
"This is the next-best thing. It will have no effect on the market for the old 
ones. If anything, it increases the interest in the originals. Those who can 
afford to buy the originals will do so. Those who can't will be able to buy the 
new ones." 


Max Himmelstein, owner of a baseball memorabilia shop in Tarzana that trades in 
the originals, agreed that the replicas won't hurt the market for the older 
statues. 


"Topps baseball cards reissued their set of '52 cards and it didn't affect the 
price of those," he said. 


He has seen the first reissued statue, Ruth. 


"It looked real nice, well-made," he said. 


The new statues have a pencil-eraser-sized stamp on the back, just below the 
players' belts, marking the 25th anniversary. The plastic is whiter than the 
originals and Alley said he has gotten some phone calls on that. 


Alley was more worried about calls from irate collectors, but he has received 
only a "few complaints, and about 700 positive letters." 


The letters were a nice boost to Alley, who wasn't sure whether the limited 
offering of 10,000 copies of each statue at $23.75 would fly. 


Now, says Alley: "Please don't print our address -- we're swamped."

WILLIAM VAN ORDEN DIES; FIXED LOY STATUE 




By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




William Van Orden, the sculptor known for his meticulous restorations of Venice 
High School's statue of actress Myrna Loy after numerous assaults on it by 
vandals, has died at 67. 


Van Orden, who completed his 12th restoration of the statue despite ill health 
and waning strength, died of cancer March 18 at the Country Villa Westwood, a 
nursing home. 


Over the years, Van Orden worked thousands of hours repairing the Loy statue 
and two other statues at the entrance of the campus that were the target of 
countless pranks and acts of vandalism. 


"They call me the Don Quixote of Venice," he said in a Times article last year. 
"They don't realize that I take that as a compliment. Myrna is my windmill." 


Van Orden was honored in June by the Venice High School student body at a 
dedication ceremony for the newly restored statue, which is now enclosed in a 
protective iron cage. He was also awarded a proclamation from the city. 


The Myrna Loy statue first came to Van Orden's attention after vandals in 1978 
used dynamite to blow off its head and arms. A year later, Van Orden drove by 
and saw the damaged statue and, grabbing a tool box, began making repairs. 


"I took out my chisel and mallet and started hammering on it when the principal 
came out and asked me, 'What are you doing?' " he told The Times. "I said, 'I'm 
here to fix the statue." 


The Venice artist began his most recent restoration about a year ago after 
vandals battered the heads of all three statues. 


Van Orden again rushed in to do repairs, but this time, he said, he did not 
believe he would live to finish the job. Doctors had told the artist that his 
death was imminent. 


"I decided not to abandon her," he said at the time. "I had to return one more 
time. This is my life's work, and after I finish this job I feel I can pass the 
job on to someone else." 


But Van Orden managed to complete the restoration of the 7-foot-tall statue of 
Loy, which is a depiction of the goddess Venus rising from the sea. It was 
sculpted in the 1920s by Harry Winebrenner, a nationally known sculptor who 
also taught art at Venice High School. He chose as his model a 16-year-old art 
student named Myrna Williams, who later gained fame on the screen as Myrna Loy. 
Winebrenner used student models for the two other statues as well. 


Van Orden received an outpouring of support and national attention following 
news reports about his efforts to preserve the statue. 


"He wanted so much to see it declared a historical landmark so it could be 
protected and preserved from future damage," said Rodan Van Orden, the artist's 
19-year-old son. 


Van Orden said his father never felt he received the recognition he deserved 
from his work on the statue. "A lot of the focus was always on Myrna Loy," he 
said. "He always felt he was not the story without her. You know he was a fine 
artist, a good painter." 


Van Orden, who was born in New York City, is survived by Rodan; his mother, 
Emily Van Orden, 92; a sister, Jane Kowach, and three brothers: Arthur, Frank 
and Raymond.

JERSEY CITY, N. J. 




Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses -- but not those yearning to 
park for free. 


A $3 fee will take effect in May at the previously free lots where people park 
their cars to take the ferry to the Statue of Liberty, said Bernard Hartnett, 
chairman of Liberty State Park's Public Advisory Commission. 


Commercial buses will pay $20 for a space.

TWO MONTHS TO LIVE; 


SCULPTOR RACES DEATH TO REPAIR STATUE 




By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 




Despite ill health and waning strength, sculptor William Van Orden was back at 
work last week, trying to save Venice High School's famous statue of actress 
Myrna Loy from an unending assault by vandals. 


Van Orden, who has repaired the statue 12 times over the last decade, had 
doubted he would have the strength to repair the statue the last time it was 
attacked by vandals in February. The 66-year-old artist says that he suffers 
from cancer and that his doctors have given him two months to live. 


"Then I decided I couldn't abandon her," he said. "I had to return one more 
time. This is my life's work, and after I finish this job I feel I can pass the 
job on to someone else." 




Outpouring of Support 


Van Orden received an outpouring of support and nearly $600 in donations after 
a recent Times article about his efforts to preserve the statue and two others 
on the campus -- replacing heads and arms that were battered and once even 
destroyed by dynamite. 


"People have been so generous," he said. "They are treating me like a king." 
Van Orden said a financial donation and the pledge of further support came from 
the New York producers of a planned musical based on the light-hearted mystery 
film "The Thin Man," in which Loy gained fame playing opposite William Powell. 


The 7-foot-tall statue of Loy, depicting the goddess Venus rising from the sea, 
was sculpted in the 1920s by Harry Winebrenner, a nationally known sculptor who 
also taught art at Venice High School. He chose as his model a 16-year-old art 
student named Myrna Williams, who later gained fame in films as Myrna Loy. 
Winebrenner used student models for the two other statues as well. 


Over the years, the statues have been the targets of pranksters and vandals. 
The most recent attack occurred in February when vandals scaled a well-lit 
protective fence surrounding the statues and damaged the heads of the Loy 
statue and two other figures. 


In response to that attack -- the first since the fence was put up in 1987 -- 
school officials plan to enclose the statues in a cage and install motion 
detectors that will trip an alarm system. "We hope that will do the trick," 
said Principal Andrea L. Natker. 




Dedication Ceremony 


Now that the restoration has begun, students are planning a dedication ceremony 
near the end of the school year. They even invited Loy, who is 83 and lives in 
New York. 


"They were able to get through to her in New York and called her," Natker said. 
"She said she appreciated what was being done, but she said she would not be 
able to come." 


At the high school lastweek, Van Orden, who recently underwent radiation 
treatment for his cancer, was working six hours a day restoring the damaged 
heads with a water-based clay. 


He said he plans to modify the face of the Loy statue. "I want to make her the 
way she was as a movie star during the height of her popularity," he said. "I 
don't want her to be a 16-year-old." 


When the clay heads are completed, he said, molds will be taken and concrete 
replacement heads will be fashioned from the molds and attached to the statues. 
The whole job should take less than a month, he said. 




Racing Against Time 


But time suddenly has become a factor for Van Orden, who has spent thousands of 
hours restoring the statues. 


"There really isn't much time," he said as he moved quickly around the statues, 
shaping the facial features with his fingers. "I really feel like I am racing 
against time. I think I can win the race as long as I stay at it." 


Although he has received little payment for his trouble, Van Orden said the 
recognition his work has brought him from the students and his family has been 
its own reward. 


"It has been my dream to have my family proud of me and now they are," he said. 
"All my life I have been wandering around the country, working odd jobs to 
support my work. This has given me something to be proud of and something for 
them to remember me by."

BEIJING REPORTS 11 ARRESTS AS CROWD RETURNS TO SQUARE 




From Reuters 




BEIJING 




Chinese authorities today announced the first arrests connected with 
anti-government protests in Beijing as up to 100,000 people crowded the city 
center to see a 33-foot Statue of Liberty replica put up by defiant students. 


On the 10th day of martial law, the official New China News Agency said that 
demonstrating motorbike riders had been arrested for disturbing public order 
and that 11 people were in custody while further investigations were carried 
out. 


It was not known if the 11 included three leaders of a new, illegal trade union 
organization that backs the students. Hundreds of workers and students camped 
outside the police station demanding information about the three. 




Convoys of Motorbikes 


Convoys of motorbike riders scorched through Beijing at the height of 
pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this month when a student hunger strike 
sparked the biggest protests against the government since the Communists took 
power in 1949. 


The news agency quoted a leader of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau 
as saying the riders had distributed leaflets, spread poisonous rumors, incited 
workers to strike and prevented military vehicles from entering Beijing. 


Tens of thousands of people crowded the center of Beijing meanwhile to see the 
Statue of Liberty replica that defiant students unveiled in Tian An Men Square, 
the symbolic heart of Chinese communism. 


Witnesses estimated that by mid-evening up to 100,000 people had poured into 
the square in a dramatic resurgence of popular interest in the democracy 
protests that had lost support on the streets after fears of a government 
crackdown. The numbers fell back to about 20,000 by midnight, the witnesses 
said. 


State television quoted officials as saying the "Goddess of Democracy" statue, 
made of polystyrene and plaster, had been erected illegally and was a 
"humiliation of the Chinese nation in such a solemn place." 




'This Is China, Not America' 


It quoted a letter from an unnamed official demanding immediate action to stop 
the erection of the statue and said: "This is China, not America." 


People pressed around the replica taking photographs.

  [Text] A bronze statue of Taiwan's late leader Chiang 
Kai-shek was removed from a traffic circle in the southern port 
city of Kaohsiung on Tuesday, a sign of the former first 
family's declining influence. The four-meter two-ton statue 
erected in 1971 was the last statue of Chiang on horseback in 
Kaohsiung. Opposition protesters have vandalized the statue on 
several occasions. 
  A spokesman for the Kaohsiung City Government said the 
statue 
was removed to ease off a traffic bottleneck at the circle, but 
he could not say why 180 police officers were mobilized at 3 am 
when the statue was being removed. The Chinese language UNITED 
EVENING NEWS said the statue was quietly removed, and police 
officers were ordered to the spot to avoid unnecessary trouble, 
such as protest. An opposition legislator has said there are 
more than 30,000 statues of Chiang Kai-shek across the island.

'GODDESS' STATUE DAMAGED BY VANDALS TO BE REPAIRED 




By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 




The "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Chinatown, destroyed by vandals last week, 
got a new lease on life Saturday as the artists responsible for the crudely 
fashioned wood and plastic-foam monument gingerly gathered up its remains and 
took it in for repairs. 


Artist Tom Van Sant, who created the statue, said the goddess will emerge anew 
after spending about three weeks in the Santa Monica Canyon studios of the 
Artists Equity Assn. 


"We built the first one for only $700, so I'm sure we can repair it for about 
the same amount of money," Van Sant said. "We may even make it stronger this 
time." 




Ropes Cut 


The 1,000-pound statue, perched in front of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent 
Assn. headquarters on Broadway, was a replica of the one erected by Chinese 
students during mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tien An Mien 
Square in June. The original was destroyed when Chinese troops moved in and 
crushed the rebellion in a bloody crackdown. 


The replica suffered a similar fate Monday when unknown vandals sliced through 
the ropes that anchored the 23-foot-tall monument to a building and toppled it. 
The goddess's head was severed in the fall and its foam torso splintered into 
dozens of pieces. 


Van Sant said some pieces may have to be replaced. Early Saturday morning, as 
he and Charles Sherman, president of the nonprofit Artists Equity Assn., loaded 
the statue onto the back of a flatbed truck, there remained signs of tension as 
two passers-by shielded their faces from television cameras and others kept 
their distance from the recovery work. 


Van Sant said many Chinese-Americans fear reprisals against relatives in China. 
"People are still intimidated," the artist said. "That's why this sculpture is 
so important." 


No one can say where the goddess will go next. It came to Chinatown last month, 
receiving the red-carpet treatment from Chinatown civic leaders, after city 
officials evicted it from its Civic Center footbridge perch on grounds that it 
represented a safety hazard. 




May Get New Home 


Now a safer location may have to be found. Sherman noted that community leaders 
in Chinatown will have much to say about the statue's eventual resting place. 
There was no one from the Chinese-American community on hand Saturday as the 
statue was carted away, but Sherman said the Chinatown community has been very 
supportive of the artists' efforts. 


Van Sant said he is not surprised that the goddess has had such a turbulent 
time of it. 


"This doesn't feel good," he said. "But it's understandable. We're dealing with 
a fight over people's rights. So I guess that we have to expect these types of 
things." 


Van Sant hopes to eventually build a more permanent monument to the Chinese 
uprising. He is seeking $300,000 in private funding for a marble version of the 
goddess that will be offered to the people of China, though he does not expect 
the Communist government to accept it.

CHINESE GODDESS OF LIBERTY STATUE TO BE MOVED TO CITY HALL 




By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 




The Board of Public Works agreed Monday to help relocate a 23-foot-high replica 
of the Goddess of Democracy to City Hall's Spring Street entrance for three 
months, moving it from its current perch on a Civic Center footbridge. 


But officials and local artists said after the meeting they will also explore 
the idea of moving the statue -- a copy of the one destroyed by Chinese troops 
in the recent Beijing massacre -- to a more permanent home in Chinatown. 


"The selection of a site is a subtle choice," said Bill Laserow, former 
president of the local chapter of Artists Equity Assn., a national visual 
artists service organization. "We're lacking the equivalent of a Tien An Men 
Square here. There's no obvious site." 


The 1,500-pound wood and plastic foam monument, designed by artist Tom Van 
Sant, was hastily erected by association members last Monday atop a pedestrian 
bridge linking City Hall East and the north end of the downtown mall near the 
Los Angeles Children's Museum. 




Safety Questions 


The statue, which was installed without city permits, raised immediate safety 
questions with police and fire officials. But the Board of Public Works, at the 
urging of officials including Councilman Michael Woo, agreed to cut through red 
tape and gave permission for the statue to remain for a week. 


At Monday's meeting, the public works board insisted that the statue be moved 
so that pedestrians could again use the bridge. But board members hastened to 
add that they would continue to cooperate by allowing the statue to be moved to 
an alternate location. 


In a 5-0 vote, board members agreed to move the replica, and bolt it down for 
90 days, on a landing of the Spring Street entrance to City Hall. The move, 
officials said, will take place next week after the return of Van Sant, who is 
in Washington this week to testify before a congressional committee on 
arts-related legislation. 


"This is great," said Artists Equity Assn. board member Arte Gross, after the 
vote. "Our first choice was to have it on the bridge, but how can you object to 
having it on the steps of City Hall?" 


After the meeting, public works board member Dennis Nishikawa, who was asked to 
supervise the move, said that he and Equity members also will explore the idea 
next week of moving the statue to Chinatown. Talks will be held this week with 
Chinatown community leaders to gauge support and locate possible sites, he 
said. 


Laserow said that the makeshift statue could remain intact for up to 20 years 
if a fiberglass coating is applied. He also said that a fund-raising effort may 
be organized to raise $250,000 from government or private sources to create a 
permanent marble version of the monument.

A HISTORIC GATEWAY IS BEING REOPENED; 


IMMIGRATION: A NEW NATIONAL MUSEUM ON NEW YORK'S ELLIS ISLAND COMMEMORATES THE 
MILLIONS WHO HELPED MAKE AMERICA A MELTING POT. 




By DAVID TREADWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




NEW YORK 




For the millions of immigrants whose first stop on American soil was at Ellis 
Island, the experience was often frightening and bewildering. 


"Everybody was herded like cattle into a great big building," recalled 
84-year-old Ellen W. Pierce of Covina, Calif., a retired school teacher who 
came to America from England with her family in 1920. "We saw several families 
who were split up. My brother and sister were hungry and crying for something 
to eat." 


Now, 36 years after the last immigrant was processed through the tiny island in 
New York Harbor, the one-time gateway to America is reopening with a new 
national museum commemorating what has been called the largest human migration 
in modern history. 


On Sunday, Vice President Dan Quayle will stand on Ellis Island and dedicate 
the new museum, which is housed in the same majestic red-brick building with 
limestone trim and copper-domed turrets that served as the island's processing 
center for more than half a century. 


Known officially as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the remodeled national 
landmark is the culmination of an eight-year, $345-million restoration project 
that included the refurbishing of the nearby Statue of Liberty and is said to 
be the largest of its kind in this country. 


Unlike the four-day, $36-million patriotic extravaganza that marked the 
reopening of Miss Liberty in 1986, however, the dedication of the Ellis Island 
museum will be decidely shorter and more subdued. 


"It's deliberately so," says Stephen Briganti, president of the Statue of 
Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, a private association spearheading the 
restorations. "You can only do one Liberty Weekend in a lifetime. We 
deliberately are making this a very thoughtful, serious and, we hope, joyful 
celebration -- but on a much lower scale." 


President Bush had originally been scheduled to be the keynote speaker. But he 
was forced to cancel his appearance because of a meeting in Helsinki arranged 
just this week with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the 
Persian Gulf crisis and other issues. 


"We're disappointed that George Bush won't make it, but Ellis Island is a great 
symbol of our past, and the President, at this point, has to be concerned with 
our present and our future," Briganti said. 


In addition to speeches by Quayle and Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan 
Jr., the Sunday ceremonies will include musical selections from around the 
world, dramatic readings evocative of the immigrant experience and the 
swearing-in of 50 new American citizens by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia. 


"I'm excited. It's my first trip back to Ellis Island since landing there when 
I was 14," said Pierce, the retired Covina school teacher, who is among 180 
Ellis Island immigrants selected by lottery to attend the event as guests. 


On Monday, the 100,000-square-foot museum will be opened to the public and is 
expected to draw between 1 million and 1.5 million visitors annually -- about 
half the number that visit the Statue of Liberty. 


Visitors at Ellis will be able to relive a poignant part of what the millions 
of immigrants who passed through here experienced, stepping off a ferry at the 
same spot at which they debarked and viewing the Manhattan skyline from the 
same vantage point. 


Inside the museum, exhibits, films, artifacts and taped oral histories will 
tell the story of the people who came to America's shores from elsewhere -- 
including the millions of Africans who were brought here forcibly as slaves. 


"The exhibits in this museum put Ellis Island into the context of its time and 
the broader context of immigration to America over 400 years," said Gary G. 
Roth, National Park Service project manager for the museum. 


Ellis, a 27.5-acre parcel of land situated about a mile off the Battery, served 
as an immigration processing point from 1892 to 1954. More than 17 million 
immigrants passed through here, the bulk of them between the late 1800s and 
early 1920s. 


The average immigrant spent three to five hours on the island, undergoing among 
other things a rigorous medical examination in which eyelids were raised to 
check for trachoma, a contagious eye disease, and scalps were examined for 
favus, a fungus infection. 


"I was kept on Ellis Island for eight months because I had favus," recalled 
Bessie Akawie, 80, of Los Angeles, who came to America in 1921 with her mother 
and five siblings from Russia. "I might have been deported if my father, who 
had come to America earlier, hadn't taken two jobs so he could pay for me to 
stay until I was cured." 


After the federal government closed down the immigration station, the island 
and its more than 30 buildings fell into neglect and disrepair. 


The cost of restoring the main building, the only one on Ellis refurbished so 
far, was $156 million. 


All the money for both the Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty restorations was 
raised from private donors, Briganti said. 


"This is a symbol of what the American people can do through private initiative 
when they are properly organized and want to get a job done," he added.

STATUE'S ROAD BECOMES ROCKY AGAIN 




From Associated Press 




PHILADELPHIA 




Rocky Balboa is down but not out. 


A crew worked two hours with a diamond-tipped circular saw and jackhammer to 
free the 8 1/2-foot bronze likeness of the movie boxing champ from the steps of 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art before returning it to the Spectrum sports 
arena. 


But fans of the South Philadelphia palooka played by Sylvester Stallone said 
Monday that they will fight to return the 800-pound statue to the stone 
stairway made famous in the original "Rocky." 


Museum President Robert Montgomery Scott has said that the statue is a movie 
prop, not art, and that he doesn't want it in front of the classical building. 


Among those working to keep the statue there is James Binns, a lawyer and 
former boxing commissioner hired by Stallone. In Binns' corner is Mayor W. 
Wilson Goode, who has come out in favor of the statue as a tourist attraction. 


The city Art Commission said it will wait 60 days before determining whether 
the statue of Rocky in boxing trunks, arms raised in triumph, will be returned 
to the steps. 


The statue, which appeared at the museum during the shooting of "Rocky III" in 
1981, was taken back from the Spectrum for filming of "Rocky V." Filming ended 
Friday, clearing the way for the producers to honor their contract to move the 
statue. 


"I feel kind of bad," said Bret Carpin, one of the workers who cut the figure 
from its concrete base. "I hope he doesn't hold it against us." 


The museum was closed Monday as usual, but a crowd of TV camera crews, 
photographers and curious museum employees circled the statue. 


In the original "Rocky," which won the Oscar for best picture in 1976, Rocky 
runs up the stone steps in triumph while training for a fight. 


The Los Angeles publicist for "Rocky V," Dave Fulton, said of the statue's 
fate, "It's pretty much up to the people of Philadelphia. It's out of our 
hands."

LADY LIBERTY IS DOING FINE ON HER OWN 




By BEN WATTENBERG, Ben Wattenberg is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 




In China, the massed students carried a replica of the Statue of Liberty, 
quoted Thomas Jefferson and demanded democracy. 


At the same time, in political salons here, it was being said that America is 
losing the public-relations offensive because George Bush is a standpat person 
while Mikhail Gorbachev is a wizard in the great media contest of ideas. 


Can both of these situations be simultaneously correct? 


No. Trust the verdict of the kids with Lady Liberty in the street, not the 
pundits who cite polls about how very popular Gorby is in Europe. Gorbachev is 
popular precisely because America and the West are winning the contest. 
Gorbachev is saying that totalitarianism is a disaster and that democracy is 
wonderful. If memory serves, that is the point that the United States has been 
making for many decades. If Gorbachev now agrees, he's plenty popular with me, 
too. 


So much of this is so new and so untested that it makes Bush's cautious 
attitude quite wise. Anyone who claims to know what will happen regarding the 
democracy wave in the communist countries doesn't understand the situation. 


I recently heard a leading East European scholar describe what is taking place 
in Hungary as "the purposeful dismantlement of a communist government by a 
communist government." Indeed, if the Hungarian government is to be believed, 
it is possible that within a year it will hold true multiparty democratic 
elections. A few years ago survey research conducted by Radio Free Europe 
showed that if a real election were held in Hungary, the Communist Party would 
get less than 10% of the vote! 


Will such an election be held? Will the Communist Party successfully make 
radical changes to gain popular appeal? Would the Soviets live with a 
non-communist victory or try to reverse it? If a new free Hungarian government 
should choose to secede from the Warsaw Pact, what would the Soviets do then? 


We do not know the answers to these questions, or the answers to similar ones 
at almost every spot in our adversary's empire. In the Baltics, the Ukraine and 
Poland, the cry for democracy is now heard, but we do not know if it will be 
heeded. It is easy to demand a bold, new, active policy from President Bush. 
But when a potential tidal wave may be transforming the terrain upon which 
policy would be made, such a call is naive. 


The potency of the democracy movement cannot even be gauged because it may be 
more than a tidal wave; it may also be a blessed and long-running journalistic 
fad. The heavy artillery pieces in the struggle for global democracy are 
television cameras. Since the incredible political events in the Philippines in 
1986, it has become clear that the most dramatic and fulfilling story for a 
journalist to cover is one about democracy, or even partial democracy, coming 
to a place where democracy wasn't before: Chile, South Korea, Poland, even the 
Soviet Union, and now China. 


The video trendiness of the story makes it yet bigger. Because television is 
everywhere, and satellites send pictures everywhere, the pictures of democracy 
are everywhere. Democracy is contagious. People who see it and don't have it, 
want it. And people who do have it and see it being denied elsewhere, want 
their governments to get tough with the governments that are doing the denying. 
If that thought isn't troubling Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega as he 
contemplates the Nicaraguan elections next February, then Ortega is not only a 
communist thug, but also a dope. 


As recent events tend to reveal, the world is spinning in our direction, 
replete with replicas of the Statue of Liberty in recently totalitarian China. 
For the time being, Bush's response is the right one: Let it keep spinning our 
way.

DAUGHTER OF CHILD STAR TO AUCTION 'OZ' FIGURINES 




By KENNETH WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




DANA POINT 




If all goes well for Lidia Penge of Dana Point, the past could very well be the 
ticket to a more prosperous future. 


Six years ago, Penge, then 24, flew to New York to explore the contents of a 
warehouse that had been left to her and her sisters by their mother, MGM child 
actress Jackie Horner. Like a time capsule, the warehouse had been unopened 
since 1953. 


For Penge, the trip was more than a chance to dust off old family photo albums 
and rustle the pages of quaint diaries. It was a chance to get to know a mother 
who died when Penge was only 14. 


"We knew that there were items that had been in storage for 30 years, but it 
was just too expensive to take time off, fly back to New York and go through 
the stuff," Penge said recently. "I couldn't afford it until 1983 when my 
husband (then fiance) loaned me $1,500 to fly back." 


Among the glass records, dusty furniture and old books and China she found in 
the warehouse, Penge discovered five hand-painted plaster figurines, each about 
11 inches tall, of characters from MGM's 1939 film classic "The Wizard of Oz": 
Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and Professor Marvel. 


"My mother had always told my sisters and me about things she had in storage in 
New York," says Penge, "but we didn't know that the Oz statues were there." 
Penge shipped them home along with some other items and put them on a closet 
shelf. 


Three months later, the warehouse burned to the ground taking with it all the 
items that Penge had left behind. "If we had waited three months longer we 
would have had nothing," she said. "No statues, no pictures, no records. No 
link to my past." 


Last September, Penge heard about the pair of original "Oz" ruby slippers that 
netted $165,000 at a Christie's auction in June of 1988. 


Her interest piqued, she took the statues to the Christie's office in Beverly 
Hills where an "Oz" specialist, Rhys Thomas, determined their age and 
speculated on the role they may have played in the actual production of the 
film. 


According to Thomas, the one-of-a-kind figurines bear a close resemblance to 
the illustrations in Frank L. Baum's book and probably were made by MGM artists 
as prototypes for the film. 


Thomas dates them between May and October of 1938 -- after the historic change 
of the slippers' color from silver to the better-for-Technicolor ruby-red, and 
before the casting of Judy Garland (the Dorothy figurine has blond hair, rather 
than Garland's brunette). 


Christie's researchers believe that producer Louis B. Mayer's secretary, Ida 
Koverman, gave the figures to Horner, who starred in MGM films "Smilin' 
Through" (1941) and "Panama Hattie" (1942) and who appeared as a regular in the 
"Our Gang" comedy series before becoming a concert pianist. 


Hoping to cash in on a wave of public interest brought on by "The Wizard of 
Oz's" 50th anniversary, Penge has put the statues on Christie's auction block 
where they will be offered today. Bidding is expected to begin at around 
$10,000, but Penge is hoping that the statues will bring in a considerably 
higher sum. 


"The thing with the ruby slippers," she noted, "is that they were old and worn 
looking. Our statues were carefully stored for 30 years, wrapped in newspapers 
in a cold, dry, cement room. They're in almost perfect condition." However, the 
years have left their mark on two of the statues: Professor Marvel and, to a 
lesser degree, Dorothy, suffer from flaking and chipped paint. 


Still, Penge hopes that the figures will fetch enough money that, once she's 
split the proceeds with her three sisters (and given Christie's its cut of 
10%), she and her husband, a sales representative for Dimension Cable Services, 
will be able to make a down payment on a house. 


"As much as we'd like to keep the statues and hand them down, a house will be a 
more practical heirloom than the statues," she said. "Fortunately, we were able 
to get enough items from the warehouse before it burned that there is still 
plenty left to pass on." 


The other items include a pair of Franklin D. Roosevelt dolls made during the 
Depression and presented to Horner by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and a pair 
of ornate, Chinese throne chairs complete with hand-carved dragons and birds.

artists as prototypes for the film before cast was selected .

SYMBOL IS UNSHAKEN; 


TEMBLOR, TECHNOCRATS FAIL TO MOVE CHINESE PROTEST MONUMENT 




By ZAN DUBIN and PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writers 




Standing tall against both temblors and technocrats, a hastily erected 
23-foot-high replica of the "Goddess of Democracy" statue destroyed by Chinese 
troops during the Beijing massacre won city permission Monday morning to remain 
atop a Civic Center footbridge. 


The 1,500-pound monument, built of wood and plastic foam, was installed within 
45 minutes by a band of Los Angeles arts activists Monday morning -- without a 
city permit. When police and fire officials arrived minutes later, they quickly 
declared it a hazard to the Temple Street traffic below and ordered it removed. 


Councilman Michael Woo and city cultural affairs chief Adolfo (Al) Nodal 
stepped in. Calling the statue a "terrific symbol," Woo rushed to the Board of 
Public Works, which had a regular meeting scheduled at 9:30 a.m. The board 
agreed to cut through red tape and take up the unusual matter half an hour 
later. 




'That Tells You Something' 


Then, at three minutes before 10 a.m., the earth shook. But despite the 4.5 
magnitude quake, the statue stood unbowed. 


"That tells you something," said Tom Van Sant, the artist who began designing 
and constructing the sculpture at his Santa Monica studio last Thursday. 
"Nature can't get it down; only the Department of Public Works can." 


When the Board of Public Works finally took up the matter, its members -- 
citing the earthquake as a true test of the statue's stability -- voted 
unanimously to allow it to remain in place for a week. 


"I guess it just got a special test of its structural integrity," board 
President Edward J. Avila said. "This board would not consider this matter in 
other circumstances, but the force of this message (for democracy) is of such 
magnitude we believe it is important that the symbol remain up." 




Tethered With Cables 


On the recommendation of Public Works engineers, the board directed that the 
monument be tethered with metal cables. Van Sant, who also designed the 
footbridge for the city in 1974, assured the board that the arched span can 
support his artwork. 


"You can put 1,000 people on that bridge and it would not compress," Van Sant 
said. 


Seconds after the board vote, a 4.3 magnitude aftershock hit, but the statue 
again remained unshaken. 


A Public Works crew then went to work at the footbridge, supplying two cherry 
pickers and guy wire. As appreciative onlookers watched, Van Sant boarded one 
of the cranes to crown the monument with a torch held high. 


"All right!" yelled Bill Lasarow, former president of the local chapter of 
Artists Equity Assn., a national visual artists service organization. 


Lasarow's group of eight artists had decided to erect the monument last Monday, 
two days after Chinese troops stormed Tien An Men Square, killing scores of 
students and bulldozing the towering symbol of their movement. 


The statue "is saying we support the aspirations of the Chinese people -- 
freedom, democratic reforms and a more open society," Lasarow said. "We want to 
say we're watching what the Chinese government is doing." 


Van Sant was initially moved to build the statue after he watched a protest by 
400 Chinese students during a trip to Boston last week. He and other Artist 
Equity Assn. members notified city officials that they planned to erect the 
monument, but did not say where it would go up. Because time was of the 
essence, the artists explained Monday, they decided to act first and then seek 
a permit. 


Police and fire officials who had sought to have the statue removed took pains 
to say that their concerns dealt with safety, not the monument's message. "We 
all support what the statue symbolizes; it's just unsafe," LAPD Sgt. Robert 
Grant said. 


After the vote, police helped block off Temple Street, between Main and Los 
Angeles streets, to assist the Public Works crewmen as they secured the statue. 
Grant joined in the applause when the torch was affixed. 


The pedestrian walkway, which connects City Hall East and the north end of the 
downtown Mall near the Los Angeles Children's Museum, will be closed through 
next Monday. During that time, the Board of Public Works will search for 
another site for the statue. 




'It's Beautiful' 


The replica, one of several that have sprung up across the nation in the last 
week, drew support from passers-by. "I think it's beautiful," said Dan Wing, a 
Civic Center worker. "This is a time when we have to state our thoughts and 
support the movement in China." 


Others, though, questioned the statue's seemingly precarious perch. And a 
handful remained downright perplexed. "I don't know what it is," said a city 
traffic officer directing vehicles away from the roadway beneath the bridge. 
"It has something to do with China?" 


By early afternoon, the statue had become a certifiable tourist attraction. An 
elderly Chinese couple, who had emigrated from Hunan to Cerritos and just 
received their permanent U.S. residency papers at the nearby Federal Building, 
posed in front of the goddess. And an artist sat at the foot of the statue, 
hoping that his portrayal of the goddess can be sent back to China via a 
facsimile machine for use as a poster. 


Buoyed by the response to the project, Van Sant said he wants to build a 
permanent monument. 


"We'll make it out of Georgia white marble," he said. "And when (the Chinese) 
finally get democracy and personal freedoms, we'll give one to them."
