NCAA SOUTHEAST REGIONAL AT ATLANTA; 


MICHIGAN GIVES NEW COACH A WIN 




By JERRY CROWE 




ATLANTA 




As a Michigan man coached Michigan Friday in the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. basketball tournament, a former Michigan man fidgeted in the stands. 


Finally, Bill Frieder left. 


"It was very emotional," Frieder said later by phone from his hotel room, where 
he watched the end of the game on television as Michigan, coached by Steve 
Fisher, overcame a six-point deficit in the last 10 minutes to beat Xavier of 
Ohio, 92-87, in the first round of the Southeast Regional at Atlanta. 


Until three days ago, Frieder was the coach of the 10th-ranked Wolverines, and 
Fisher was his No. 1 assistant. 


But when Frieder accepted an offer Wednesday to coach at Arizona State, 
Michigan Athletic Director Bo Schembechler decreed that Frieder would not coach 
the Wolverines in the NCAA tournament, as Frieder had planned. 


"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team," 
Schembechler said. "A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan." 


And so Frieder, who broke down Wednesday night in a tearful farewell to his 
players, watched Friday's game from afar. 


He sat about 10 rows behind the Michigan bench (and not far from Schembechler) 
with his wife, Janice, and their daughter, Laura, before he was besieged by 
reporters and autograph-seekers. 


Frieder wandered around the Omni for a while after that, he said, before 
heading back to his hotel room, leaving Janice and Laura behind. 


A great weight was lifted from his shoulders, Frieder said, when the 
third-seeded Wolverines (25-7) rallied to beat the scrappy Musketeers. Michigan 
will meet South Alabama (23-8) Sunday in a second-round game. 


"It would have been a tough, tough situation for me to handle had they not 
won," Frieder said. "Now that they've won, I feel great about the whole 
situation because they're over the hump on what my situation did to them. 


"It's got to give them great confidence in Steve Fisher, who had to come from 
behind to win. So, I'm really excited about it all." 


How had the situation affected the Wolverines? 


Not much, apparently. 


They overpowered the overmatched Musketeers down the stretch after Xavier 
(21-12) had built a 71-65 lead with 9:45 left. 


"The game was there for us to steal," Xavier Coach Pete Gillen said, "but it 
slipped through our hands." 


Michigan, which got 23 points from Glen Rice and 23 points and eight assists 
from Rumeal Robinson, ultimately wore down the Musketeers. 


"It was like water torture," Gillen said. "Who would crack first? 
Unfortunately, we finally cracked a little bit and they just grabbed it." JERRY 
CROWE

VALLEY ROUNDUP: MICHIGAN PENSION FUND TO INVEST IN AVTEK PLANE 




A state pension fund in Michigan announced its intention to invest up to $12.5 
million in a new corporate airplane being developed by Avtek Corp. of 
Camarillo. 


The State of Michigan Retirement Systems Venture Capital Fund, which invests in 
new firms seen as having high growth potential, said its investment would be 
conditioned on Avtek receiving a similar-sized investment from private 
investors. 


In September, Avtek said it would build the plane in Battle Creek, Mich., if 
the plane receives the necessary Federal Aviation Administration certification. 
Avtek chose Michigan because the state agreed to help raise part of the $20 
million that Avtek needs for the various tests required by the FAA. 


Avtek's plane, a twin-engine, 6,600-pound aircraft that will cost about $1.75 
million, is made mostly of plastic-like fiber "composites" designed to make it 
lighter and less costly.

NOT SOFT ON MARSHMALLOW TOSSERS, UNIVERSITY WARNS 




From Associated Press 




ANN ARBOR, Mich. 




University of Michigan officials cannot be accused of being soft on rule 
enforcement, but rule violations are going soft on them. 


The school announced plans to add marshmallows to the list of objects banned 
from Michigan Stadium during Wolverine football games. Already banned are 
umbrellas, coolers, chair backs, backpacks and alcoholic beverages. 


"This sounds funny, but it's a real problem," Bruce Madej, Michigan director of 
sports information, said Tuesday. 


Fans in the student section began pitching marshmallows at each other during 
the season opener against Notre Dame, and the activity has stuck. 


During an Oct. 7 game, the attention shifted to band members and cheerleaders, 
who were peppered with the candies. Thousands of marshmallows littered one end 
of the stadium after it was all over. 


Marshmallows aren't harmless, Michigan officials said. Some fans press together 
several marshmallows to create a gooey ball. Mixed with water, the concoction 
can become as hard as a golf ball, said Jack Weidenbach, Michigan's senior 
associate athletic director. 


"We've had a number of complaints," Weidenbach said. "One woman said she got 
hit and had a red spot on her cheek that bothered her all day. There are 
concerns that somebody will get hurt."

SOMETHING MISSING FROM MICHIGAN WIN IN NCAA PLAYOFFS 




Michigan won the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship by overcoming 
the added pressure of going through the basketball playoffs with an assistant 
coach. 


But in all the TV hoopla, there was no mention of Bill Frieder, the coach who 
brought them there. 


Mike Downey really captured the situation in his column the morning after. Can 
you imagine the agony Frieder had gone through the last few weeks? And to have 
to watch the final in a hotel room on TV? I was awfully disappointed to hear 
not one word from Steve Fisher crediting Frieder with any contribution to the 
success of the Michigan team when Fisher accepted the trophy. 


The real heels are the Arizona State group who forced Frieder to sign under an 
unrealistic deadline. 


Such a bittersweet win for Michigan.

BASKETBALL NOTEBOOK; 


MICHIGAN STATE COMES OF AGE IN BIG 10 RACE 




By DAVE DORR, ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH 




CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 




A Michigan State recruiting class that two years ago was considered one of the 
nation's best is coming on quickly in the Big Ten Conference basketball race. 


The timing is exquisite. Michigan State's emergence coincides with a Purdue 
mini-slump. The race could tighten even more when Michigan plays at Minnesota 
on Thursday. The Gophers are 12-0 at Williams Arena in Minneapolis this season. 


Purdue, once the unchallenged leader, has come back to the pack at 9-2, but 
still leads the league. Michigan State is 9-3 and Michigan 8-3. Minnesota is 
7-4. 


Boilermakers coach Gene Keady put his fist through a blackboard in his team's 
locker room after Melvin Newbern's 12-footer beat Purdue 73-72 Sunday in 
Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote celebrated in his 
team's locker room Monday night after the Spartans won 80-70 at Iowa. The 
conference road victory was the fifth for Michigan State. 


Illinois coach Lou Henson says Michigan State "is playing as well as anybody in 
the league right now. Not only are they winning on the road, they're winning 
big." 


The Spartans have won three in a row to keep the heat on Purdue, and now 
they'll be home in brand-new Breslin Center for three in a row. They meet 
Illinois on Saturday, Indiana on Feb. 25 and Michigan on March 1. The spacing 
is perfect. Heathcote has more than enough time to prepare for each game. 


"We're in a position to do something," Heathcote said. "We hope we can keep the 
run going." 


The Spartans' late-season spurt is due mostly to the return to form of Steve 
Smith, a 6-foot-6 scoring whiz at guard, and 6-10 Mike Peplowski. 


Peplowski, a 270-pounder, has been battling a damaged knee for two years. He's 
put the pep in Michigan State. Smith played the early part of the season with a 
broken bone in his left hand. 


"Smith is back 100 percent on offense," Heathcote said. "We're elated about 
Peplowski. The last two games he's been able to play 25 minutes apiece. He's a 
space-taker. He's not a force offensively. We don't go to him much. We don't 
have time to work on pivot moves. What we tell him is 'be in the right place at 
the right time.' His shots will come seldom, but when they do they should be of 
a high-percentage type. He can make a difference for us. He gives us a big 
player in there that we've lacked." 


After the Michigan game, the Spartans play at Minnesota and at Northwestern. 
They finish at Breslin against Purdue in a game that could settle the title. 
The Boilermakers have four of their final seven at home. 


Tourney Talk: Iowa coach Tom Davis, recalling the circumstances of last season, 
said: "Our best team from the conference in the NCAA Tournament may not be the 
champion. 


"There are two different races going on -- one for the title and one to see who 
can make the best run from the Big Ten to the Final Four. The team that stays 
healthiest has the best chance of getting to the Final Four." 


Indiana was the Big Ten champion last season. Illinois, the runner-up, wound up 
with the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional and represented the conference in 
the Final Four along with Michigan, which placed third in the conference. The 
Wolverines then knocked off Illinois and Seton Hall to win the national title. 


Quotebook: Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote on the Big Ten race: "There are a 
lot of key games yet. I still like Minnesota's depth. I like Michigan's awesome 
size inside. I don't think we've got a great team in the league this year. I 
thought we had two or three last year."

NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT: THE FINAL FOUR; 


THE FINAL NOBODY EXPECTED; 


MICHIGAN BEATS ILLINOIS, 83-81 ON HIGGINS' SHOT 




By JOHN NELSON, Associated Press 




SEATTLE 




There were 33 lead changes, but the biggest change of all was for Michigan. The 
Wolverines finally beat Illinois, and they're headed into college basketball's 
national championship game. 


Sean Higgins took a rebound of a missed three-point attempt with two seconds 
left and scored from short range, giving Michigan an 83-81 victory over 
Illinois in the Final Four semifinal game Saturday. 


The victory sends Michigan, playing in its first Final Four since 1976, into 
the final against Seton Hall on Monday night. 


The victory was sealed when Glen Rice, Michigan's hottest hand during the 
tournament, intercepted a length-of-the-court inbounds pass by Illinois' Steve 
Bardo as time ran out. 


Rice led the Wolverines with 28 points, three less that his tournament average, 
in a game that was so close in almost every statistical category that the only 
numbers that were different at its end were the scores. 


Illinois, ranked third in the nation at season's end, had the speed. Michigan, 
ranked 10th, had the size. In two previous Big Ten Conference meetings this 
season, speed had won. 


This time, Michigan used a combination of its size advantage, the hot hand of 
Rice, the ball-handling of Rumeal Robinson and the 16 rebounds of center Loy 
Vaught to prevail. 


The lead changed hands 17 times in the first half, which wound up with Michigan 
holding a 39-38 lead. The biggest lead of the game was eight points, 16-8, on 
two free throws by Illinois' Nick Anderson just 5 1/2 minutes into the game. 


Michigan outscored Illinois 12-6 to start the second half, getting six of those 
points from the 6-foot-10 Terry Mills, who is three inches taller than any of 
Illinois' starters. That run gave the Wolverines a seven-point lead, 51-44, 
with 15:35 left. 


Illinois, however, scored 10 of the game's next 12 points, getting four from 
Lowell Hamilton, to lead 54-53 with 11:26 to play. No more than four points 
separated the two teams the rest of the way. 


For Michigan's interim coach, Steve Fisher, it was the fifth straight victory 
in an undefeated coaching career that began in this tournament. For Illinois' 
Lou Henson, whose career record is 535-249, it must have been a major 
disappointment. 


Henson had taken Illinois into the tournament for seven straight years before 
reaching the Final Four, only to lose to a team he had beaten twice during the 
season. His Fighting Illini were even ranked No. 1 for a week in January, but 
now that honor will fall to either Michigan or Seton Hall at the end of the 
season. 


Robinson and Higgins each scored 14 for Michigan, now 29-7, while Kenny Battle 
had 29 and Anderson 17 for the Illini, 31-5. 


Michigan shot 47 percent from the field, Illinois 45 percent. Michigan had 45 
rebounds, Illinois 39. 


When Michigan called time out with 1:36 to play and Illinois ahead 79-78, both 
teams had hit 17 of 34 shots in the second half. 


Mark Hughes created the final lead change of the game, rebounding a miss by 
Mills, then converting a three-point play to put the Wolverines ahead 81-79 
with 1:09 left. 


Illinois called timeout, and when the Illini came back, Battle hit a short 
jumper in the lane, tying the score at 81 with 33 seconds left. Robinson took 
the ball upcourt for Michigan and ran the clock down to the final few seconds 
before finding Mills in the right corner. 


Mills' 3-point attempt was long, Higgins took the rebound, put it in and 
Michigan was ahead 83-81.

FRIEDER HAPPY FOR MICHIGAN BUT WISHES HE WAS WITH TEAM 




By AP 




NEW YORK 




Bill Frieder, who left Michigan on the eve of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. tournament, had mixed emotions Saturday as he watched the Wolverines rout 
Virginia, 102-65, to reach the Final Four. 


"I was extremely happy for (interim coach) Steve Fisher, (assistant coach) Mike 
Boyd and the entire team," Frieder said. "You have to remember that I hired 
Steve and Mike, and I recruited these players. 


"Of course it hurt a little that I couldn't be with them, but I was there in 
thought and spirit." 


Frieder, who accepted the coaching job at Arizona State the day before the 
tournament started, watched the Southeast Regional final on television from his 
temporary home in Scottsdale, Ariz. 


Frieder was ordered to discontinue coaching Michigan by Athletic Director Bo 
Schembechler after he accepted the Arizona State position. 


"I was confident Michigan could handle Virginia," he said in a telephone 
interview. "They were just a better team, bigger and stronger." 


Frieder said he missed some of the telecast because of his recruiting duties at 
Arizona State, "but I got back in time to see them cut down the nets," he said. 


Despite a fine record during his nine years at Michigan, Frieder's Wolverines 
never advanced to the Final Four. 


"If that's the worst thing that ever happens to me, I'll have a great life," he 
said. "I'm just thrilled for (seniors) Mark Hughes and Glen Rice because this 
was their last chance to make it. I'll have another chance." 


Frieder said he thinks the Wolverines can win the national championship. To 
reach the final, Michigan will have to beat the winner of today's Midwest 
Regional final between Illinois and Syracuse. 


"Illinois is an extremely tough basketball team," Frieder said. "They're 
undefeated with (guard) Kendall Gill. Of course, Michigan is undefeated with 
Steve Fisher." 


Frieder said it would be "a crime" if Fisher isn't named as his replacement. 


"He was a loyal assistant for seven years and now he's doing a great job in the 
tournament," Frieder said.

of a new Michigan Department of Natural Resources, by a Type II transfer, as defined by Section 3 of Act No. 380 of the
Public Acts of 1965, being Section 16.103 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. 








Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 also provided that the responsibilties and authorities of the MWRC were transferred,
via a Type III transfer, from the Water Resources Commission to the director of a new MDNR. 

Pursuant to EPA's request, Michigan submitted numerous documents to EPA that were necessary for EPA to determine
whether the revisions to Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program resulting from Executive Order 1991&hyph;93 would
comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations and whether such revisions were
substantial. According to Michigan, there had been no substantive changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program
as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Instead, according to Michigan, Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 merely
resulted in some reorganization within MDNR. Michigan certified in an Attorney General's Statement that all of the
state authorities included in Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description remained in full force and
effect after issuance of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. 

Based upon its review of the documents submitted by Michigan, EPA made a preliminary determination that there had
been no substantial revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31.
However, because there appeared to be a significant amount of public interest in this matter, EPA chose to seek public
comment on its determination. Consequently, on April 21, 1994, EPA published a notice in the 



Federal Register



 of EPA's preliminary determination and stated that ``EPA is seeking public comment concerning whether any substantial
revisions to the State wetlands program were effected by the MDNR reorganization, and comment on Agency approval
or disapproval of any revisions to Michigan's wetlands program as outlined in Executive Order 1991&hyph;93 and MDNR's
December 15, 1993 submittal.'' The notice further emphasized that ``EPA is not seeking at this time, public comment
on unrelated issues regarding Michigan's wetland program.'' Finally, the notice stated that copies of Michigan's
description of the wetlands program, related correspondence and EPA's findings of no substantial revisions would
be available for public inspection at two locations in Michigan. 





II. Comments 





In response to the April 21, 1994 notice, EPA received comments from nine commenters who disagreed with EPA's preliminary
determination that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetlands program. In
addition, the United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, stated that it agreed with EPA's preliminary
determination that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetland program and offered
two additional comments. EPA's detailed responses to all comments received are set forth in a document entitled ``Response
to Comments Raised Regarding Revisions to Michigan Wetland Program.'' This document can be obtained from Mr. Douglas
Ehorn at the address and phone number listed above. A summary of the comments and EPA's responses to the comments is
provided below.

NCAA SOUTHEAST REGIONAL AT ATLANTA; 


RICE SCORES 36, MICHIGAN BEATS SOUTH ALABAMA 




By DON MARKUS, Baltimore Sun 




ATLANTA 




The common thought running through the Omni early in the second half of 
Sunday's game between Michigan and South Alabama was that the upstart Jaguars 
were about to pull off another upset over another big-name, big-conference 
opponent in the second-round of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Southeast Regional. 


Although South Alabama had a six-point lead, 57-51, with 16:06 remaining, and 
the crowd on its side, Michigan's Glen Rice was of a different mind. 


"What was in the back of my mind was that I didn't want it to be my last game," 
the Wolverines senior forward said. 


As things turned out, Rice made sure that it wasn't. With a game-high 36 
points, Rice led third-seeded Michigan past South Alabama, 91-82. 


The Wolverines advanced to the regional semifinals against North Carolina 
Thursday in Rupp Arena at Lexington, Ky. 


It will mark the third consecutive season that Michigan (26-7) will meet North 
Carolina during the NCAA tournament. The Wolverines were eliminated the last 
two times. 


In fact, Michigan might not have had made it this far if it wasn't for Rice. 


"The Rice kid was unbelievable," said South Alabama Coach Ronnie Arrow, whose 
team had beaten state-rival Alabama Friday. "I've coached some great shooters, 
but he could be one of the best I've seen." 


Rice, who made 16 of 25 shots from the field, brought Michigan back from its 
six-point deficit by scoring 10 of the Wolverine's next 12 points. And it was 
Rice who started a crucial 10-2 run late in the game that eventually sealed the 
victory for the Wolverines. 


A 16-footer with 3:06 remaining gave the Wolverines an 80-78 lead. With 
Michigan ahead, 83-80, and 1:30 left, Rice made a three-point shot from the top 
of the key. Rice also had a team-high eight rebounds and five assists. 


"It's a lot easier when you have No. 41 (Rice) as one of your options," said 
Michigan assistant coach Steve Fisher, who is 2-0 since taking over the team 
last week after Bill Frieder, who took a position at Arizona State, was told by 
Athletic Director Bob Schembechler he could no longer coach the team. "We 
wanted to find Glen Rice. We wanted to get him open." 


With the help of some massive picks, Rice got open and got the ball. It didn't 
hurt that Rice, at 6-feet-7, had a four-inch height advantage over Junie Lewis, 
who played him whenever the Jaguars were in a man-to-man. 


"It was much easier (to shoot)," Rice said. "But our big men were putting some 
body on their smaller guys." 


The screens thrown by Michigan, in particular Terry Mills and Mark Hughes, 
enabled Rice some shooting space. 


"The more belly up I got, the more Mills came out," said Lewis, who led South 
Alabama with 25 points. "I tried to go through him a couple of times. It hurt 
so much that I started going around him." 


Said Arrow: "We were hoping to get their big ones tired by running on them. 
Those guys are so strong that trying to get through them is like trying to get 
through Grand Central." 


For a while, it looked as if Michigan was going to be run right out of the 
tournament. After taking an early 20-9 lead, the Wolverines watched South 
Alabama go ahead, 26-25. The Jaguars led at the half, 47-44. 


But the Wolverines came back behind Rice, and a three-point play by Mills with 
3:17 left put Michigan ahead for good, 83-80. Mills finished with 24 points, 
seven rebounds and five steals.

MIKE DOWNEY: GOOD OLD BULLY BO IS AT IT AGAIN 




By Mike Downey 




Texas A&amp;M made a move on University of Michigan football Coach Bo 
Schembechler a few years back, offering him a whole bunch of money. Bo said no. 


But first, he thought it over. He considered what was best for himself and for 
his family. Michigan sweetened Schembechler's pot to help him make up his mind, 
and the owner of the Detroit Tigers even forked over the deed to a pizza 
franchise in, of all places, Columbus, Ohio. 


Had Schembechler left, it wouldn't have been the first time a coach ever 
abandoned a university for a better offer. Were that not true, Schembechler 
would still be coaching Miami of Ohio. 


Bill Frieder found himself in a delicate situation last week. Arizona State 
wanted a new basketball coach -- and wanted him now. ASU officials offered the 
job to the Michigan coach but said they needed his answer immediately. Now or 
never. 


Frieder said now. 


He expected to hop right back on a jet and return to his Michigan team, which 
had an appointment to play Xavier a couple of days later in the first round of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. Frieder's Wolverines were 
given, by some, a shot at winning the national championship. 


The self-righteous Schembechler promptly decided that if they were to take the 
championship, they would have to take it without Frieder. From his seat as 
athletic director, Schembechler stripped Frieder of his command, like 
Eisenhower taking the Third Army away from Patton. 


"A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan," decreed Gen. Schembechler, who put 
assistant coach Steve Fisher in charge for postseason play. 


Schembechler has had heart problems in recent years, and now you can see why. 
It's hard for doctors to find. 


Schembechler says he wants "a Michigan man" to coach Michigan. Bill Frieder 
attended the University of Michigan, which is more than Bo Schembechler can 
say. 


Schembechler presumably wants his adopted school's basketball squad to have the 
best possible shot at the national championship, because such shots do not come 
along very often. Then he refuses to allow the team's head coach to run the 
team in the tournament. 


Schembechler insinuates that Frieder deserted or even betrayed his basketball 
players. Michigan has those basketball players because Frieder is the kind of 
guy who goes recruiting night and day, day and night, until these kids see more 
of him than they do of their relatives. 


The least Schembechler might have done is consider the players' feelings. He 
should have asked them if they felt seduced and abandoned. He would have gotten 
responses like the one from Loy Vaught, who said that Frieder did not get a 
fair shake. 


Contrary to public opinion, college basketball players can think. And most of 
them know that Frieder was not exactly slapping them across the face by leaving 
for what he believed to be a better job. They respected the right of an 
individual to choose a new life for himself -- geographically, economically, 
whatever. 


If you follow Schembechler's reasoning, Frieder should have risked losing a 
position that appealed greatly to him by demanding that his new employers make 
their decision when he wanted it made. 


See, that's how Schembechler thinks, because this is a man to whom no one ever 
talks back. Schembechler is a professional bully. Nobody can tell him what to 
do, and everybody must do what he says. He is entrenched. He is popular on 
campus and off -- as popular as Frieder was not -- because being victorious on 
the field makes him appear both formidable and indispensable. 


Our favorite Schembechler-related moment occurred after the coach had ordered 
his football players to stop talking to the press. One day, running back Butch 
Woolfolk granted an interview but first was asked if it might get him into 
trouble. 


"Hey," Woolfolk said, "I'm not 8 years old. Nobody tells me when and where I 
can talk." 


Bill Frieder gave his heart and soul to his basketball players. While other Big 
Ten schools labored to land quality athletes, Frieder lassoed them into Ann 
Arbor, provided Michigan audiences with winning records, first-division 
finishes and regular tournament appearances. 


As a reward, some of Michigan's own fans this season jeered him and unfurled 
crude, cruel banners insulting him. Do you know what Michigan's home record 
under Frieder was? Ninety-four victories and 10 defeats. 


Some flop this guy was. 


Those very Michigan followers who abused and criticized him probably are among 
those today who are knocking him for not demonstrating to them any loyalty. 


Frieder is taking most of the heat in his home state this week, and probably 
would have gotten the blame if Xavier had defeated Michigan Friday, even though 
the coach had to purchase a ticket just to get into the gym. 


We will continue to wish Michigan well in its endeavors, including interim 
coach Steve Fisher, a swell fellow who we happen to have known for more than 20 
years. 


What amuses us most is the scuttlebutt that Bo Schembechler intends to -- in 
his own words -- "seek the greatest basketball coach in America to coach this 
team," including a call on Indiana's Bob Knight for recommendations. 


We have this adorable scenario in mind in which the greatest coach in America 
leaves his current university for Ann Arbor, whereupon Schembechler tries to 
explain to the coach's former employers that business is strictly business.

MICHIGAN RATED NO. 1 IN FIRST POLL OF SEASON 




From Associated Press 




Michigan's football team is picking up where Michigan's basketball team left 
off -- No. 1 in the country. 


Five months after winning the national basketball championship, the Wolverines 
are the nation's top college football team in the Associated Press' Top 25 
poll. 


Michigan received 23 first-place votes and 1,439 points to edge defending 
national champion Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish, who will play at Ann Arbor on 
Sept. 16, were ranked No. 1 on 20 ballots and received 1,378 points. 


The only other teams receiving first-place votes were Nebraska (10), Miami (4), 
USC (1) and Florida State (2). 


Nebraska is ranked third, followed by Miami, USC, Florida State, Louisiana 
State, Auburn, UCLA and Arkansas. 


Two of Michigan's top three quarterbacks were recently declared ineligible, but 
the Wolverines still have senior Michael Taylor, who started the first nine 
games last season before suffering a broken collarbone.

IN BRIEF; 


MICHIGAN U. TO GET BILL FOR VANDALISM 




From Times wire services 




ANN ARBOR, Mich. 




Mayor Jerry Jernigan said the University of Michigan can expect a bill for at 
least $14,000 for police work and damage to public property during the 
celebration of Michigan's 80-79 NCAA basketball tournament victory over Seton 
Hall. 


"We're going to send a real clear message that this kind of behavior just won't 
be condoned in Ann Arbor any longer," Jernigan said Thursday. 


The party, during which street signs were uprooted, awnings torn down and 
windows broken, cost the city $7,500 in police overtime and damage to fire 
equipment, City Administrator Del Borgsdorf said. Borgsdorf said damage to 
street signs and traffic lights totaled $6,500, and damage to private property 
totaled $78,000. 


University President James Duderstadt said the celebration that followed 
Michigan's championship victory was disgraceful and an embarrassment to the 
university.

SATURDAY'S FOE IS MICHIGAN; 


BRUINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT FACING WINLESS TEAM 




From Associated Press 




UCLA will face a winless team Saturday night. But Bruins Coach Terry Donahue 
believes it is a team that just as easily could be considered the best in the 
nation. 


Michigan certainly would be ranked No. 1 had it beaten Notre Dame last Saturday 
instead of losing a 24-19 decision to the Fighting Irish. 


"If you take two plays off the film, Michigan is the No. 1 team in the 
country," Donahue said, referring to Raghib (Rocket) Ismail's two kickoff 
returns for touchdowns. "But you can't take those two plays off, and that's to 
Notre Dame's credit. 




'No Question' 


"In my mind, there's no question Michigan is going to win the football game 
(without the two plays)." 


Michigan was ranked second before losing to Notre Dame in its season opener. 
The Wolverines, now ranked fifth, will probably come to California in an angry 
frame of mind. 


Asked if it would have been easier for the Bruins to prepare for Michigan had 
the Wolverines beaten Notre Dame, Donahue smiled and said, "Our task, getting 
ready for Michigan, was going to be hard no matter how you cut the bread." 


UCLA, ranked 24th, brings a 1-1 record into the nationally televised contest, 
which begins at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl. 


Donahue realizes the Bruins have not been very impressive so far this year. 


After being hammered 24-6 by 14th-ranked Tennessee in their opener Sept. 9, the 
Bruins rallied for a 28-25 victory over 20-point underdog San Diego State last 
Saturday night. 


He views Saturday's game as a test of character for his team. 


"You'd have to be blind to not see what kind of a football team they have. 
Michigan is one of the top football teams in the country. I really view the 
Michigan game as an opportunity for our football team to step forward and show 
its colors. . . . 


"The biggest concern I have about our football team right now is we must 
increase our intensity all over the field. We were more intense (against San 
Diego State) than we were against Tennessee. We stayed in the game and really 
competed for four quarters. I guarantee you we'll take a step forward this 
week." 


The Wolverines will be without quarterback Michael Taylor, who was injured in 
the Notre Dame game. Coach Bo Schembechler will have to start freshman Elvis 
Grbac at quarterback. 




'Both Good Athletes' 


Donahue said the switch probably will not affect the Bruins. 


"They're both good athletes," Donahue said. "Grbac did an excellent job against 
Notre Dame. He doesn't run as well as Taylor but showed a lot of poise." 


"What it does, it cuts us down," Schembechler said. "We're going to cut back on 
what we're doing offensively. I don't want to put that kind of pressure on 
Elvis to be a Michael Taylor and know as much of our offense as Taylor does."

RIOT FOLLOWS MICHIGAN NCAA WIN; 


MICHIGAN FANS' 5-HOUR RAMPAGE CAUSES DAMAGE, INJURIES 




From Times Wire Services 




ANN ARBOR, Mich. 




Thousands of fans went on a wild, five-hour rampage in the streets early today 
to celebrate Michigan's first NCAA basketball championship, leading to eight 
arrests, widespread property damage and several injuries. 


It took riot-equipped State Police, Washtenaw County deputies, city police and 
security officers from the University of Michigan until about 4 a.m. to control 
the estimated 5,000 rowdy fans who wildly celebrated Michigan's 80-79 overtime 
win over Seton Hall. 


"The area's been cleared," Lt. Craig Roderick said in the predawn hours today. 
"There's damage all over the place. We have not documented it, but it is 
extensive to both public and private property." 


He said eight of the rowdy fans were arrested and an undetermined number of 
others were injured from flying beer and liquor bottles as well as rocks. 


During the spontaneous celebration, an awning on the China Gate restaurant was 
pulled down, a main traffic light was destroyed and a Detroit television 
station van had its windows smashed and tires slashed. 


At least one car was overturned, numerous windows were smashed, street signs 
were torn down and the pavement was littered with glass from broken beer 
bottles. 


One Ann Arbor police officer was rushed from the scene shortly after the melee 
began and was successfully treated for chest pains, Roderick said. 


Shortly after Rumeal Robinson made two free throws to guarantee Michigan its 
first national basketball title, thousands of Michigan fans stormed out of 
restaurants, bars and dorms to begin their celebration. 


Police responded quickly, blocking off a central part of the campus to 
vehicular traffic. Within an hour, campus and city police called for 
reinforcements from State Police and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department. 


"It's a mess," Roderick said as the size and activity of the crowd swelled. For 
the next couple of hours, it was pretty much a standoff between police and the 
fans. 


Fireworks filled the sky, at times, and some of the fans stripped off their 
clothes while perched on rooftops along South University Road on campus.

BO KNOWS ROSE BOWL, BUT ILLINI DON'T, 24-10 




By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 




As usual, everything is coming up Roses for Michigan, which shouldn't surprise 
anyone. After all, Bo knows the Rose Bowl. 


Michigan disposed of Illinois, 24-10, Saturday at Memorial Stadium, and while 
it didn't clinch another trip to Pasadena, it helped. A lot. 


"If we don't win this game, we're not going to win the championship, we're not 
going to the Rose Bowl and we're not going to get the things we want," Michigan 
Coach Bo Schembechler said. 


Added Illinois Coach John Mackovic: "This was not a regular game, this was a 
big game." 


And with good reason. 


Now, rather than depend on the kindness of strangers, third-ranked Michigan 
(8-1) will determine its own postseason travel plans. Beat Minnesota and Ohio 
State, and Schembechler returns to the West Coast. 


It will be nice to see him again, considering his conduct on the sideline 
Saturday. 


Schembechler sent what looked like a clipboard to an early death when 
quarterback Michael Taylor stumbled on a third-down play late in the first 
quarter. 


Schembechler steamed when his Wolverines had eight penalty flags thrown their 
way during the course of the afternoon. 


And Schembechler, who has undergone two heart operations, surely must have sent 
his cardiologist rushing for Valium because of the way the coach took exception 
to a referee's call late in the third quarter. Suffice it to say that 
Schembechler's sideline vocabulary was probably as blue as the Michigan 
baseball cap he wore. 


What he should have done was sit back and enjoy a Michigan victory over 
eighth-ranked Illinois (8-2) that featured all the normal Wolverine 
ingredients: a running game that eats up opponents and the clock; and a defense 
that manages to confound, though, no one is quite sure how. 


After giving up 10 points and yardage galore in the first half, the Wolverines 
put a choke hold on Illinois quarterback Jeff George and the Fighting Illini's 
high-tech offense. George finished with 253 yards on 22 of 38 pass attempts, 
but he didn't throw a touchdown, which was something of shocker given 
Michigan's somewhat suspect pass defense. 


Nor were there any fourth-quarter heroics, a George staple these days. Instead, 
George completed only three of seven passes in the final period, four if you 
count the interception he threw to Michigan strong safety Tripp Welborne with 
2:12 remaining. 


"At the start, they were sitting back in zones and we pretty much did what we 
wanted to," George said. ". . . They had to change something." 


They did, but Schembechler wasn't in the mood to disclose any state secrets: 


"We made a few adjustments, but nothing I can tell you that will make for 
exciting reading." 


Make no mistake, the Wolverines were worried about George. He spent nearly the 
entire first half standing . . . and standing . . . and standing in the passing 
pocket, waiting seemingly forever for his receivers to find openings. Pressure 
was applied only on occasion by a Michigan defense that appeared more concerned 
with not allowing a long completion. 


That explained why George was able to answer almost every Michigan first-half 
score with an Illinois score of its own. 


 -- Michigan tailback Tony Boles broke loose for a 73-yard run on the second 
play of the game. ("I found a crease, and there I went," Boles said.) Jarrod 
Bunch scored a play later. 


Not to worry. George led Illinois on an 85-yard touchdown drive on its first 
possession, tying the score, 7-7. 


 -- Michigan's J.D. Carlson kicked a 47-yard field goal with 2:02 remaining in 
the first quarter. 


George completed a 41-yard pass play to wide receiver Mike Bellamy on the next 
possession. The Illini's Doug Higgins went on to kick a field goal of 25 yards 
to tie the game again. 


Even when the Wolverines took a 17-10 halftime lead on a two-yard touchdown run 
by Taylor with 4:34 left in the second quarter, Illinois couldn't have been too 
worried. The Illini had blown several scoring opportunities, but there wasn't 
any reason to think similar chances wouldn't be available in the final two 
quarters. 


Michigan certainly wouldn't have argued with the theory. 


"I thought it was going to be a long second half," Michigan free safety Vada 
Murray said. 


It was -- for Illinois. 


It turns out that the Illini would receive only one other real chance to beat 
the Wolverines. It came with 4:30 left in the third quarter. 


With fourth-and-one on the Michigan four and trailing, 17-10, Mackovic decided 
to go for the first down. George took the snap, dropped back and threw wildly 
in the general direction of tight end Don Donovan. Murray was there to knock 
the pass down. 


An inventive play, it wasn't. 


"The tight end ran right into me," Murray said. "If you don't know it's a pass 
then, you shouldn't be playing." 


Said Schembechler: "On third and fourth downs, that guy George is the most 
dangerous guy they have on the team. If that quarterback is on my team, I 
wouldn't second-guess that play at all." 


Schembechler might have been an extra bit forgiving. Mackovic is a close 
friend. Schembechler gave him his first coaching job way back when. 


Also, Michigan won. 


As for the rest of the game, it was vintage Michigan, with time-consuming 
drives over land. Boles finished with 115 yards. Taylor had 65 yards. Bunch had 
66. 


No Illinois player rushed for more than 47 yards. 


"We controlled the game pretty much," Boles said. "I knew if our defense 
stopped (George), we could win the ballgame."

LAKE MICHIGAN SERENADED BY 'SINGING SAND' 




By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 




HOFFMASTER STATE PARK, Mich. 




The theater is darkened, engulfed in the sound of crashing waves, as the story 
of sand dune creation unfolds on screen. First comes formation of the beach -- 
fore dune, trough, back dune and barrier dune. A fragile environment springs to 
life next, grasses at first, followed by woody plants and eventually a forest 
of hemlock and sugar maple on the back and barrier dunes. 


The theater is part of this 1,054-acre park established in 1967 to protect and 
preserve Lake Michigan's 2 1/2-mile stretch of towering sand dunes. The park's 
centerpiece is the 13-year-old Genevieve Gillette Nature Center, a $500,000 
complex including the Sand Dune Theater dedicated to the interpretation of sand 
piles. 


"Dunes are home to many unique plants and animals," said Earl Wolf, 37, a park 
naturalist here for the last 10 years. 


The giant sand piles along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan collectively 
represent the world's largest accumulation of sand dunes bordering fresh water. 
Michigan, with its unique Sand Dune Protection and Management Statute, has 
275,000 acres of sand dunes, 40% in public ownership. 


Snow often covers the dunes this time of year and visitors can be seen 
navigating the park's 10-mile trail on snow shoes or skis. They are accompanied 
by a symphony of chirping birds -- including black cap chickadees, 
white-breasted nut hatches, tufted titmice, blue jays, red-bellied woodpeckers 
and meadowlarks -- and squirrels who scamper across the snow amid a maze tracks 
left by red fox and white-tail deer. 


Soon, tiny spring peeper frogs will be peeping robustly as colorful painted 
turtles scurry about with spotted salamanders and other wildlife. And as the 
snow melts, visitors to the ice-clogged shoreline will experience "singing 
sand," a sound heard few places on Earth. 


"It's a very special tune played by the sand," said park ranger Elizabeth 
Brockwell, 23. "You scoot your feet along the beach and when the right amount 
of moisture is present, tiny sand particles scrape against each other and emit 
a peculiar musical whistle or squeaking sound." 


The center is filled with graphics describing dune formation and growth here 
and throughout the world. Exhibits portray plants and animals found in sand 
dune ecosystems and a gallery is devoted to works by Jeanne Rockette and other 
Michigan sand dune artists. 


Visitors, including thousands of schoolchildren, ascend the wooden Dune Climb 
Stairway that winds to the top of 220-foot-high Sugar Hill and overlooks 
190-foot Mt. Baldy and a breathtaking sweep one of Michigan's most scenic 
beaches. 


The park is named after the late P. J. (Pete) Hoffmaster, Michigan's first 
superintendent of parks; the sand dune museum in honor of Genevieve Gillette, 
who died two years ago at 88. 


Known as Michigan's "Miss State Park," Gillette was the first woman to receive 
a degree in landscape architecture at an American university (Michigan State). 
From the 1920s until her death, she was a leader in establishing Michigan's 
park system. Gillette wrote Michigan's wilderness bill, was the first president 
of Michigan's Parks Assn. and was named to the 12-member Citizen's Advisory 
Committee on Recreation and Natural Beauty by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 
1966.

   By GEORGE GRAHAM


DON'T let the polls get you down,' is Governor John Engler's message to his
fellow Republicans in President George Bush's Michigan campaign team. Mr
Engler and his campaign workers know what it is like to pull off an election
upset: he trailed his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor James
Blanchard, by 14 points just two days before balloting for Michigan's
governorship in 1990.
'We easily could see something of that magnitude again,' he said yesterday.
But as Michigan chairman of the Bush re-election campaign, Mr Engler may
face an even more daunting task of resurrection.
While Michigan has often voted Democratic in state and congressional
elections, it has not favoured a Democratic presidential candidate since
Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
This year that might change: polls in the state show Governor Bill Clinton,
the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by anywhere from 13 to 19 percentage
points, with about 10 per cent backing the independent, Mr Ross Perot.
Ms Colleen Pero, an Engler aide seconded to run the Bush campaign in
Michigan, warns that polls conducted by organisations from outside the state
systematically over-sample areas with low voter turnout.
All the same, Republicans admit their internal polling shows the president 9
or 10 points behind Mr Clinton.
They also acknowledge it is hard to envisage a scenario in which Mr Bush
wins re-election without winning this pivotal mid-western state's 18
electoral college votes.
There is nothing very special about the issues that are swaying Michigan
voters in this election. 'It's jobs, jobs and more jobs; the economy, jobs
and taxes over and over again,' says Ms Pero.
'I don't think Michigan is significantly different from the nation as a
whole. In fact I think it is a very good reflector,' says Professor David
Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
While Michigan has not suffered the same sharp economic downturn during the
Bush presidency as, say, California, it has been familiar for years with
lay-offs and plant closures - the latest being General Motors' Willow Run
assembly line. Unemployment, at 9.4 per cent in July, remains significantly
higher than the national average.
Some of the issues that Mr Bush has emphasised cut both ways in Michigan.
The recently concluded North American Free Trade Agreement, for example,
worries car industry and other unionised workers in the Detroit area. But
Nafta is viewed more positively in the furniture industry around Grand
Rapids, which exports heavily to Mexico, as well as in Sault Sainte Marie in
Michigan's icy Upper Peninsula, which is growing fast on the strength of
open trade with its sister city in Ontario.
Bush campaign officials hope some of the local referendum issues which will
share the ballot on November 3 could draw out voters more favourable to the
president. These measures include proposals to cut property taxes, to limit
the number of terms that could be served by elected officials, and to roll
back car insurance rates in exchange for a cap on accident medical benefit
payments.
They are also optimistic about Republican chances in Michigan's
congressional elections. The state's population stagnated in the 1980s and,
in consequence, it lost two seats in the 10-yearly redistribution of seats
that takes effect this year.
The result has been to add Republican voters to the districts of several
Democratic congressmen. State Republican campaigners believe they have good
chances of ousting such incumbents as Congressmen Bob Carr, William Ford and
perhaps even David Bonior, the House majority whip.
Some even suggest that the prospect of victory in these congressional races
could stimulate Republican voters and help Mr Bush. Certainly, few expect
the traditional 'coat-tails' effect where the president helps his party's
candidates lower down the ticket.
'This is, has been and will remain an 'against' election, and not a 'for'
election,' says Prof Rohde.
But former Governor Blanchard, who is heading Mr Clinton's Michigan
campaign, knows from personal experience not to underestimate the electoral
skills of his old nemesis, Mr Engler.
Mr Blanchard must avoid the low turnout which cost him the 1990 governor's
election. That will require 'get out the vote' activities in heavily
Democratic Detroit city, but also among the 'Reagan Democrats' of Detroit's
blue-collar suburbs.

ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN 22, USC 14; 


MICHIGAN DOESN'T SUFFER A BROWN-OUT IN THIS ROSE BOWL 




By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 




As Michigan fans counted down the final seconds of the 1989 Rose Bowl Monday, 
Demetrius Brown took the final snap and fell down. 


Then the Wolverine quarterback jumped so high you thought he was never going to 
come down. 


Brown lofted the ball into the air and pulled it back into his left arm, 
cradling it like a father holding a newborn baby. 


"I'm going to give it to Bo," Brown said, after Michigan presented Schembechler 
with a 22-14 victory over USC. 


Brown ran through a gantlet of outstretched hands as he jogged into a tunnel 
leading to the locker room. It was a moment of jubilation and vindication. 


Although Brown doesn't easily display his emotions, he cracked a smile as 
proudly ran off the field. 


"Am I happy?" Brown asked. "Yes. This is the Rose Bowl. Everybody felt we 
couldn't do it, but we proved them wrong." 


A loner, he planned to celebrate the biggest victory of his career alone. 


"I'm in pain because I hurt my back in the third quarter," Brown said. "I'm 
going to go rest my tailbone." 


Brown helped Michigan ease the pain of losing 7 of its previous 8 Rose Bowl 
appearances. 


After a poor start, Brown bounced back to lead the Wolverines to 3 second-half 
touchdowns as Michigan overcame a 14-3 halftime deficit. 


Although he completed his first 4 passes, Brown misfired on 5 consecutive 
throws as Michigan's offense got out of sync in the first half. He overthrew 
receivers and saw perfectly thrown passes dropped. 


Faced with a similar situation in the 1987 season, Brown tried to force his 
passes into double and triple coverage and wound up throwing a school-record 16 
interceptions. 


A year of experience and losing his starting job to Michael Taylor has helped 
him understand himself and the Michigan offense. Brown maintained his poise 
against the Trojans. 


When Taylor went down with an injury late this season, Brown went back into the 
lineup and helped the Wolverines win the Big Ten title. 


"The biggest problem Demetrius had was that they allowed him to do too much 
because of his abilities," said Mark Messner, Michigan's All-American defensive 
tackle. "He tried to force things. But he's a tremendous talent and (an) 
underrated quarterback." 


Although Brown was overshadowed by Rodney Peete going into the game, Brown was 
more consistent than USC's All-American quarterback in the Rose Bowl. 


Brown completed 11 of 24 passes for 144 yards and 1 touchdown, contrasted with 
Peete's 15 of 21 passes for 158 yards with 2 interceptions and 0 touchdowns. 


"Demetrius had a great game," split end Greg McMurtry said. "He came out and 
got us in the right plays and did everything he had to do to win that game." 


Said Gary Moeller, Michigan's offensive coordinator: "I'm really proud of 
Demetrius. He was the guy everybody expected to throw an interception and he 
didn't." 


Brown set the tone for Michigan's second-half comeback on the last series of 
the first half when he drove the Wolverines from their own 31 to the USC 16 in 
just 1 minute 8 seconds. 


Brown rifled a pass to John Kolesar to get Michigan to midfield and followed 
with a 23-yard strike to Derrick Walker to the Trojan 16. 


Although the clock ran out on the Wolverines, the drive re-established Brown's 
confidence and that of Michigan. 


"It wasn't so much that Demetrius had a bad first half, because everyone had a 
bad first half," offensive tackle Mike Husar said. "We knew we were getting 
beat in the first half, and we weren't going to let it happen in the second 
half." 


Brown directed Michigan on a 70-yard touchdown march on the first possession of 
the second half, keeping the Trojan defense off-balance as he deftly mixed the 
plays sent in by Schembechler with some calls of his own. 


Seeing an opening in the Trojan defense, Brown called an audible, and the 
Wolverines ran a flanker reverse to Kolesar for 16 yards. 


"The way Kolesar wanted to play this game we had to give him the ball as much 
as we could, and he probably should have been given the ball more," Brown said. 


Brown wouldn't admit to calling the reverse at the line of scrimmage. 


"He's not going to tell you," Schembechler said. "He's very well trained." 


Brown set up the touchdown with a 22-yard scramble to the USC 6. He then 
completed a 6-yard touchdown pass play to Chris Calloway for Michigan's first 
touchdown. 


After Brown's passing softened up USC's defense, the Wolverines went to 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who did most of the work when Michigan drove 92 yards to 
score the go-ahead touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter. 


Although Hoard was named the player of the game after rushing for 142 yards and 
2 touchdowns, he shared the credit with Brown. 


"Demetrius has really grown a lot," Hoard said. "He made a couple of mistakes 
but he hung in there."
