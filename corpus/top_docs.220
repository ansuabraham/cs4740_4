  [Text] Vientiane, April 7 (KPL) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating, yesterday morning handed over to Lao 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon the border control building on 
the Lao side of the friendship bridge. 
  Mr. Vang Lattanavong, Lao ambassador to Australia and Mr. 
Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to Laos were among high 
ranking officials from both sides at the solemn hand-over 
ceremony. 
  In his speech, Prime Minister Paul Keating said that 
speaking 
on behalf of the Australian Government and people, he was 
pleased to hand over the border control building to the Lao 
Government and people. He referred to the bridge as a door 
opening up to the development in the country and the adjacent 
facilities were regarded as the key of the development door. 
The building houses immigration, customs, police, banks and 
postal offices. He said that the border control building and 
the Mekong bridge itself could best serve to testify, in the 
concrete term, the fruitful Australian-Lao cooperation and 
friendship. Mr. Paul Keating congratulated both Australian and 
Lao technicians and workers whose high sense of responsibility 
fullfilled the construction targets in terms of time and budget. 
Australian prime minister touched upon the significance of the 
Australian-Lao agreement for the promotion and protection of 
investment which would help establish confidence for potential 
Australian investors. 
  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon of Laos in his return 
address, speaking on behalf of the Lao people, said that the 
facilities were built with Australian grant. Apart from the 
Mekong bridge, the border control building, the gifts of the 
Australian Government and people to Laos, would facilitate the 
work of the Lao personnel. 
  Mr. Khamtai Siphandon expressed thanks once again to the 
Australian side for its generosity and good intention. He said 
that the Australian aid projects for Laos were highly 
appreciated. They were the symbol for the ever increasing 
traditional relations of friendship the two countries had 
enjoyed. The Lao prime minister attached great importance to 
the Australian aid which had instrumentally helped building the 
country's economic infrastructure and helped free Laos from a 
state of economic difficulties. 
  After delivering their speeches, both prime ministers 
officially lifted the veil off the building foundation plate. 
  Mr. Paul Keating and his delegation left Laos on board of a 
special plane for an official visit to the Kingdom of Thailand. 
The Australian prime minister paid a two-day official visit to 
the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] on April 5 and 6.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia will pay an 
official visit to Vietnam shortly. This event is taking place 
nine months after the visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. Here is our comment on the event: 
  The visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet in last year is considered a historic event in bilateral 
relations and so it will be the coming visit to Vietnam by 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. [sentence as heard] 
  These significant events taken place in less than a year 
prove that relations between Vietnam and Australia have reached 
a turning point in cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  During the last two years, the relations between the two 
countries have seen wonderful developments. In 1992, the trade 
turnover between the two countries was less than $2 million and 
the figure is 120 times now, reaching $252 million. At present, 
Australia is the sixth biggest investor in Vietnam with 23 
projects worth $2.65 billion. However, leaders of the two 
countries will wish to further develop bilateral cooperation, 
especially in trade. These wishes are likely to be achieved. 
  On his visit to Australia last year, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet reaffirmed that the Vietnamese Government welcomes and will 
create favorable conditions for Australian companies wishing to 
do business with Vietnam. 
  For his part, the Australian prime minister also affirmed 
that his country is ready to help Vietnam in transport, 
telecommunications, infrastructure, energy, and (?oil and gas) 
exploration. 
  It is expected that there will be new and positive decisions 
made during the coming visit to Vietnam by the Australian prime 
minister to make the bilateral cooperation and relationship more 
fruitful.

<F P=106> [7 April PASASON editorial: "New Step for Lao-Australian </F>
Relations and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] By an invitation from His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai 
Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth of Australia, led a government delegation to pay an 
official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 5 to 6 April. During 
the visit, H.E. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and his 
delegation were accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and the multiethnic Lao people. H.E. Paul 
Keating and the delegation paid a courtesy call on H.E. Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, in an atmosphere of warm 
friendship. It was considered a very significant event in the 
history of good relations between Laos and Australia. 
  An official consultative meeting to exchange views between 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and H.E. Paul Keating was held at the 
Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane in an atmosphere of 
profound friendship and mutual understanding. During the 
meeting, the two prime ministers informed each other about the 
domestic situation as well as lines and policies in their 
respective countries, the lines and policies which serve as a 
firm basis for effectively strengthening cooperation for the 
benefit of the peoples of Laos and Australia, thus contributing 
to the common trend of establishing and promoting peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. 
  Noteworthy is that following the consultative meeting, the 
two sides reached an agreement on investment promotion and 
protection between the two countries. This agreement is 
considered an important basis for improving cooperation between 
the Lao and Australian peoples to a new level -- a level which 
will bring about ever greater benefits for the two countries. 
Following the meeting, the Australian Government pledged to 
continue its support and assistance to Laos. Regarding this, 
beginning in 1994, the Australian Government will establish a 
47.5 million Australian dollar four-year aid project for Laos. 
In addition, the Australian Government has decided to give, 
through the WHO, gratis aid in the form of food worth one 
million Australian dollars to Laos. It will also continue to 
support and encourage more and more Australian businessmen to 
invest in the LPDR. 
  During the visit, H.E. Paul Keating also attended the hand 
over ceremony of the Border Control Station at the Lao-Thai 
Friendship Bridge, which was built with gratis financial aid 
from the Australian Government and people as a gift to the LPDR. 
The assistance given to the LPDR by the Australian Government 
and people in building the Border Control Station as well as the 
Friendship Bridge and other projects in the recent past has 
substantially reflected the long-standing relations of 
friendship between Laos and Australia, which have fruitfully 
developed with each passing day. 
  The multiethnic Lao people highly assess the effective 
assistance in various fields given by Australia, and consider it 
an important contribution to the development of economic 
infrastructure for the LPDR. The multiethnic Lao people also 
would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of H.E. 
Paul Keating and delegation on their visit to the LPDR, a visit 
which will contribute to further strengthening the already 
effective friendly relations and cooperation between Laos and 
Australia for the benefit of the Lao and Australian people as 
well as in the interests of peace, stability, friendship, and 
cooperation for the development in Asia-Pacific and the rest of 
the world.

  [Text] Dear friends: Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating will pay his first official friendship to our country at 
the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. In today's issue, 
NHAN DAN carries an editorial pegged to this event entitled: In 
the Interests of the Vietnamese and Australian Peoples and for 
the Sake of Peace, Cooperation, and Development. The editorial 
reads in part as follows: 
  Following the first official visit to Australia by our prime 
minister in May 1993, the Vietnam visit by Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating has drawn the attention of broad sections 
of public opinion in the region and other parts of the world. 
This important event marks a new developmental step in the 
friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Australia. 
  Vietnam and Australia established diplomatic relations in 
1973. The friendly and cooperative ties between the two 
countries have continued to develop with each passing day since 
then based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual 
understanding, equality, and mutual benefit. Australia highly 
valued Vietnam's renovation achievements in all fields as well 
as Vietnam's foreign policy of diversification and 
multilateralization and its efforts to improve relations with 
many countries in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  Australia lifted its trade embargo at an early date and 
resumed its development aid for Vietnam. It has also shared its 
experiences and stepped up cooperation with Vietnam. The 
cooperative ties between the two countries have been improved 
step by step. Both sides have worked together toward the goals 
of implementing agreements on economic and trade cooperation, 
thereby creating favorable conditions for increasing the value 
of bilateral trade activities to $70 million in 1991 from $2 
million in 1982 and to $252 million in 1992 and then to $366 
million in 1993. Australia has become Vietnam's seventh trade 
partner and ranks fifth on the list of foreign investors in 
Vietnam with 26 projects valued at $776 million. 
  Australia has also helped our country with the training of 
hundreds of specialists; the formulation of laws on mining, 
telecommunications, and state management over 
telecommunications; and the enhancement of farmland irrigation, 
hydrometeorological, public health, and tourist sectors in which 
Vietnam has a need and Australia has great potential and high 
technologies. 
  Regarding many regional and international issues, Vietnam 
and 
Australia have reached more and more consensus on the need for 
peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region 
that the two countries have regarded as the top priority 
objectives of their foreign policies. 
  We hope that Prime Minister Paul Keating's official 
friendship visit to Vietnam will end in success, help strengthen 
mutual understanding, and lead the multifaceted cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia to a higher level, a larger scale, 
and a broader scope for the sake of each country's prosperity 
and in conformity with the common trends of peace, cooperation, 
and development in the Asia-Pacific region.

  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has 
arrived in Vietnam for last stop on an Asian tour which has also 
included Laos and Thailand. Mr. Keating is the first Australian 
leader to visit Hanoi. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top 
Vietnamese leaders including President Le Duc Anh, the Communist 
Party General Secretary Doi Muoi, and the Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  Australian officials say Mr. Keating will take a low-key 
approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong 
statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian 
parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese 
officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian 
parliamentary human rights delegation to visit Vietnam later 
this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on 
expanding economic links with Vietnam. Australia is currently 
the third largest investor in Vietnam taking $620 million 
[currency not further specified], mostly for oil and 
telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth 
$366 million with Vietnam running up a $136 million surplus 
through crude oil sales to Australia. 
  Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating has spent his first 
afternoon in Vietnam sightseeing in Hanoi. The formal part of 
the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome 
before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well 
reports Mr. Keating's main purpose in going to Vietnam is to 
assess the potential for economic development and what further 
role Australia can play. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says Vietnam has a 
great opportunity to develop and he believes Australia can help 
make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social 
policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change 
his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the Vietnam 
War, Mr. Keating said he does not discriminate in commemorating 
Australia's war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at 
the opening of the Vietnam Memorial in Canberra. 
  [Keating in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in 
Australia and the same belief in our values as every other 
service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But 
again.... This in Hanoi and, really, in places I am visiting 
there is no natural opportunity as there was in Thailand. [end

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Paul Keating, prime minister 
of the Commonwealth of Australia, met with H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon at the Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane at 
0900 today. On this occasion, H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon expressed pleasure over and highly appraised the 
official, friendly visit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR] of H.E. Prime Minister Paul Keating. He said the visit 
is an event of historic significance in the friendly relations 
and good cooperation between Laos and Australia. 
  H.E. Khamtai expressed the hope that his consultative 
meeting 
and exchange of views with his excellency the Australian prime 
minister will enable both sides to understand ever more 
profoundly the internal situation and policies of each country. 
He said the understanding will serve as a firm basis for 
effective enhancement of cooperation for the benefit of the 
peoples of the two countries, and that it will also contribute 
to common trends for the establishment and promotion of peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. H.E. Khamtai also 
informed his excellency the Australian prime minister about 
certain problems in the socioeconomic development of the LPDR 
which is entering the eighth year of the implementation of 
comprehensive restructuring. He said: Through the 
implementation of the restructuring policy, the national economy 
has been progressively developed; the average rate of economic 
growth per year is as high as 6.58 percent; the prices of 
commodities and the kip currency are stable; the living 
conditions and cultural life of the people have explicitly 
improved; and the assistance and cooperation given to Laos by 
foreign countries and international organizations have also 
increased. There are now as many as 410 direct investment 
projects valued at $580 million by foreign countries in Laos, 
excluding investment in large-scale hydroelectric projects. 
  Regarding Lao-Australian relations, H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon noted that efforts have been made by the two 
countries to promote relations in various fields. He pointed 
out that as of now, bilateral relations between Laos and 
Australia have expanded ever more extensively and rapidly. H.E. 
Khamtai expressed gratitude to the Australian Government and 
people for their precious assistance given to the Lao Government 
and people in carrying out the socioeconomic development cause 
in the LPDR, in particular in building the communications 
infrastructure as well as training technicians of various 
branches and in community development. H.E. Khamtai reiterated 
that the LPDR is ready to increase cooperation with Australia in 
the economic, cultural, scientific, and technical fields. He 
also expressed the hope that the Australian Government will 
continue to support and encourage more and more Australian 
businessmen to invest in the LPDR. 
  Replying, H.E. Prime Minister Keating expressed thanks to 
the 
Government and people of Laos for the warm welcome accorded him 
and his delegation during the visit. H.E. Keating noted: 
Australia and Laos have maintained diplomatic relations for 
more than 40 years. It can be assured today about the great 
potential of the friendship. We are two different countries 
which have endured similar problems, for example problems in the 
areas of trade and investment, with a view to making our people 
enjoy security and prosperity. The Australian Government 
pledges to support Laos in carrying out its reform to achieve 
development in the same way other countries do. Regarding 
implementation of reform, the LPDR has put into force the law on 
investment, a law which guarantees security for foreign 
investors. Various Australian companies are now ready to invest 
in Laos. 
  In conclusion, the Australian prime minister said: We can 
contribute to the construction and development of Laos, and on 
the basis of this spirit the Australian Government has decided 
to render aid to Laos for the construction of this bridge across 
the Mekong River. In addition, beginning in 1994, the 
Australian Government has decided to set up a four-year 
assistance and cooperation project for Laos. This project costs 
more than 40 million Australian dollars. Besides, Australia has 
given Laos gratis aid in the form of food worth one million 
Australian dollars, and another one million dollars of gratis 
aid to preserve the environment in the LPDR. 
  The meeting lasted one hour. Later, H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and H.E. Prime Minister Paul Keating attended 
the signing ceremony of a Lao-Australian agreement on investment 
promotion and protection, and a memorandum of understanding on 
the development project of the Se Kaman hyrdoelectric power in 
Attopeu Province and the Namcha 1 and 2 hydroelectric works in 
Vientiane Province. Signing the agreement and the memorandum for 
the Lao side was Leun Sombounkhan, vice chairman of the Planning 
and Cooperation Committee; and signing for the Australian side 
was Michael Mann, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary 
of Australia to Laos. Also signing the memorandum on the 
Australian side was Peter Ray, chairman of the Hag Enterprise 
Corporation Company of Australia. The agreement on investment 
promotion and protection between Laos and Australia will serve a 
significant basis in the legal aspect for the two countries to 
march forward to a new level which can bring about ever greater 
benefits to the peoples of the two countries. It will also 
serve as a basis which creates confidence for Australian 
investors to invest in the LPDR.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 5 April PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Salute and </F>
Welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government Delegation"] 
  [Text] In response to an invitation from His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of 
the Commonwealth of Australia, will lead a Commonwealth of 
Australia Government delegation on an official, friendly visit 
to the LPDR on 5 April. The multiethnic Lao people throughout 
the country -- elated at this event, which is significant in 
Lao-Australian relations -- feel greatly honored to have the 
opportunity to welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government 
delegation. 
  This official, friendly visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
follows the official, friendly visit to the Commonwealth of 
Australia by H.E. Khamtai Siphandon in mid-December 1993. The 
visit is considered a new and significant event since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 
over four decades ago. This visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
reflects the Australian people's good friendship with the 
multiethnic Lao people. It is also considered a very 
significant event in the history of relations between the two 
countries. It will, therefore, serve as a firm basis for 
strengthening friendly relations and cooperation effectively in 
the immediate and long terms in the interest of the peoples of 
Laos and Australia, thus contributing to the common trend for 
the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship, 
and cooperation among various countries in this region and the 
rest of the world. 
  Laos and Australia have maintained good relations for a long 
time. Over the past 10 years or so, the two sides have made 
efforts to promote relations in various fields. It is 
noteworthy that following the visit to Australia by H.E. Prime 
Minister Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Australian relations have 
developed ever more extensively and rapidly. On this occasion, 
the multiethnic Lao people would like to express their profound 
gratitude to the Australian Government and people for the 
significant support and assistance they have rendered to the Lao 
Government and people in building and developing the LPDR's 
economy and society, especially in building the communications 
infrastructure, training technicians in various branches, and 
developing communities. The assistance in the construction of 
the Friendship Bridge, which serves as a good token of the 
friendly relations and fruitful cooperation between Laos and 
Australia, is noteworthy. 
  We wish H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth 
of Australia, and his party glorious success in this official, 
friendly visit to the LPDR. Its success which will contribute 
to further promoting and expanding relations and cooperation 
between the two countries ever more fruitfully for the benefit 
of the peoples of Laos and Australia.

<F P=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his 
way home after a three-nation tour of Asia. Mr. Keating's trip 
took him to Laos, Thailand, and finally Vietnam, where he 
invited the communist party leader, Do Muoi, to visit Australia. 
It's an invitation the Vietnamese leader accepted and this is 
sure to cause unhappiness among some of the Vietnamese who fled 
their country after the communist's victory in 1975 and now live 
in Australia. Christopher Kremmer reports from Hanoi that Mr. Do 
Muoi will be seen as a more provocative figure than the 
reformist prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, whose presence in 
Australia last year led to demonstrations by Australian 
Vietnamese. 
  [Begin Kremmer recording] It's the oldest rule of war -- 
both 
sides on two-fronts -- and Mr. Keating has broken it. His 
invitation to communist party chief Do Muoi proved alienating an 
important lobby group, which so far has remained relatively 
quiet about his visit to Vietnam. The invitation was issued 
during what one official described as unusually long and 
interesting talks between Mr. Keating and the 76-year-old party 
leader in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday. The VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY 
later reported that it has been accepted by Do Muoi with 
pleasure. As the party chief has in recent months been visiting 
neighboring ASEAN countries, an invitation to come to Australia 
was unexpected. Even a reformist leader like Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet attracted the wrath of a small section of the 
Vietnamese community when he visited Australia last year. But 
Do Muoi, head of the party which maintains armed [word 
indistinct] party-rule over Vietnam is an entirely different 
matter. He represents to some Australian Vietnamese a painful 
reminder of a war which did so much damage and deprecation to 
their lives. And as Vietnam [word indistinct], that it was not 
just the allies who were responsible for atrocities in the war. 
Terror was a weapon used by both sides to polarize communities 
and keep villagers on side. A communist party government is 
still accused by Asia Watch and other human right and religious 
groups of serious infringements of civil liberties and political 
rights. Above all the right of the people to choose their 
government at free election. As one commentator remarked 
recently a great deal of history stands between Vietnam and 
United States. The same could be said of Vietnam and Australia. 
The commentator went on to observe that while communism may be 
dead in Vietnam, authoritarianism is thriving. That affects the 
relatives of Australian Vietnamese still living here. Do Muoi's 
communist party is seen by some as bearing most responsibility. 
Mr. Keating has observed that the wounds of war are still deep 
in Vietnam, but the wounds are also deeply felt by Vietnamese 
who fled their homeland for Australia and many of them are 
unlikely to be impressed by the invitation. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hosted a banquet in 
honor of visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, his 
wife, and his delegation at Government House yesterday evening. 
The Australian prime minister and his entourage are currently 
on an official visit to Thailand as guests of the Thai 
Government. 
  In a welcome speech delivered at the banquet, Prime Minister 
Chuan said that the meeting between the Thai and Australian 
delegations during the visit will provide a good opportunity for 
both sides to develop their existing friendship, create better 
understanding, and expand cooperation between the two countries 
in the exploitation of their energy and potentials. The meeting 
will also enable both sides to find ways to enhance their roles 
in increasing the regional dynamic and collaboration. In 
addition, the prime minister expressed his admiration for 
Australia's constructive role in the Southeast Asian and 
Asia-Pacific regions. Australian participation in the opening 
of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge is an historic event that 
reflects a great achievement resulting from international 
cooperation. Australia is thereby considered to have a role in 
the process of establishing peace and progress in Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and Prime 
Minister Paul Keating of Australia visited Vietnam in the first 
fortnight of April. Here is our review of these visits: 
  The two prime ministers came to Vietnam with a view to 
broaden cooperation with Vietnam. The Swedish prime minister 
inaugurated an Ericsson mobile communication system in Vietnam. 
The Ericsson Group of Sweden is a well known manufacturer of 
electronic and telecom equipments. The visit to Vietnam by 
Australian prime minister came after the two countries reached 
an agreement on the construction of My Thuan Bridge crossing the 
Tien River in southern Vietnam. This makes Australia rank the 
first among investors in construction in Vietnam as well as of 
all Indochina. 
  From either side of the Earth, Sweden and Australia have one 
thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of 
Vietnam infrastructure, one of the most essential needs of 
Vietnam at the present moment. 
  The Australian prime minister also announced $140 million of 
aid to Hanoi to help the latter continue its renovation process. 
Sweden has also so far [word indistinct] granted aid to 
Vietnam. With the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, Sweden plans to boost the economic ties with Vietnam. It 
is a new decision taken by Sweden. 
  Both Australian and Swedish leaders acknowledged the 
positive 
results of the ongoing renovation process in Vietnam. The truth 
created by Vietnam itself has urged more countries to invest in 
the country.

rejected a call to highlight the role of Australian war veterans 
during his visit to Vietnam. In Thailand yesterday, Mr. Keating 
visited the graves of Australians who died working on the 
Thai-Burma railway during the second world war. National Party 
leader Tim Fisher has now urged Mr. Keating to make a similar 
gesture in Vietnam. However, as political correspondent Graeme 
Well reports, Mr. Keating said he'll be keeping the focus of his 
visit to economic development. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Human rights is a sensitive issue 
for Vietnam and Mr. Keating is expected to raise it. He said an 
Australian delegation will be visiting Vietnam to assess human 
rights. But before leaving Bangkok for Hanoi, Mr. Keating 
played the issue down. 
  [Keating] There is no one particular matter that comes to my 
mind at the moment. So are we engaging the... [pause] I mean... 
I think the important thing about the visit to Vietnam is that 
I'll be the first Australian prime minister to have gone

  [Text] Vientiane, April 4 (KPL) -- Lao Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri on 
April 2 morning signed at Lan Xang Hotel in Vientiane an 
agreement concerning the friendship bridge across the Mekong 
River, scheduled to be officially opened on April 8. 
  The agreement deals with preparation for the official 
opening 
of the bridge in the presence of Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] Pesident Nouhak Phoumsavan and his majesty 
the king of Thailand. On the occasion, Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating will present the bridge, gift from the 
Australian government and people to the people of Laos and 
Thailand, to Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon and Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai. 
  The agreement represents a legal framework for Lao-Thai 
cooperation in all aspects concerning the management and 
maintenance of the bridge, including the ownership and 
cooperation in dealing with matters that may arise over the 
bridge. 
  This document also stipulates the following terms on the 
operation and maintenance of the bridge. 
  1. The two sides are jointly responsible for the management 
and maintenance of the bridge by equally sharing the cost of its 
management and maintenance. 
  2. A joint commission will be set up to determine and review 
procedures on the management and maintenance of the bridge to be 
carried out by a brigade with its routines according to the 
agreed procedures. 
  3. The sides have agreed that fees for cars passing the 
bridge will be charged only at one time at an equivalent rate as 
vehicles enter the bridge on either Lao or Thai sides, except 
for cargo trucks with drivers which will be charged for the 
passage on both sides. 
  4. The sides have agreed that each will try to simplify its 
transit formalities, making it convenient and fast to ensure the 
effective operation of the bridge. 
  Concerning the ownership over the bridge, the sides have 
agreed to divide it equally. This agreement will have no effect 
on the common border of the two countries as provided in the 
international law. On their cooperation on the bridge operation, 
the sides have agreed that each side sets up a permanent 
committee to monitor, coordinate, consult and discuss with each 
other concerning the operation of the bridge and matters that 
may arise over the area between the transition pier on both 
sides, including arrests of wrongdoers on the said area on a 
case-by-case basis. Solutions to the matters will be considered 
according to the law of each side, and measures against the 
wrongdoers will be taken as mandatory. 
  After signing the agreement, the foreign ministers of Laos 
and Thailand also gave a news conference.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President 
Suharto and visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating 
agreed here Tuesday to work together to reduce Indonesia's trade 
deficit with Australia. 
  Both leaders shared the view that bilateral trade ties 
between the two countries need to be intensified to cut the 
deficit, Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said when announcing 
the results of a two-hour talk between President Suharto and 
Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia is worth US 
$2.15 billion a year. 
  In the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than 
scheduled, the two heads of state also discussed the upcoming 
informal summit of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) to 
be held in Bogor, about 50 km south of Jakarta, on 15 November 
this year. 
  The second APEC meeting will be attended by representatives 
from 18 countries, namely the ASEAN member states (Indonesia, 
Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and 
Thailand), the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, Papua New 
Guinea, Chile, Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, 
Taiwan and Japan. Prime Minister Keating expressed his readiness 
to help Indonesia make the APEC meeting a success, Minister 
Murdiono said. [passage omitted -- covered in referent item] 
  Minister Murdiono also confirmed that President Suharto 
explained about the recent revocation of the licences of TEMPO 
weekly magazine, EDITOR magazine and DETIK tabloid to his guest. 
  Keating arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit to hold 
talks with President Suharto and other Indonesian officials. He 
is also scheduled to open a major Australian trade exhibition on 
Wednesday. 
  The trade exhibition is a part of "Australia Today Indonesia 
'94", the largest trade and cultural promotion program Australia 
has ever undertaken in the region. It is scheduled to last 
until 3 July 1994. This is the third visit Keating has made to 
Indonesia since he became prime minister.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 11 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
gave a banquet here this evening in honour of his Australian 
distinguished guests. At this event, he delivered a speech 
which read in part : 
  `It has been only a year since our first meeting in 
Canberra, 
but we have every reason to be satisfied with the rapid 
development of the multi-sided Vietnam-Australia cooperation, 
especially in the economic, trading, educational and training 
fields. We greatly appreciate Australia's active help to us in 
building a North-South 500 KV grid, a nearly-completed important 
project in our national construction. We also highly value the 
effective implementation of the Australian aid to train 
Vietnamese officials, as well as Australia's active contribution 
to a break-through in the relations between Vietnam and the 
international financial institutions. 
  `I am optimistic about the prospect for the development of 
friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries. 
Despite thousands of miles separating us and the difference in 
historical circumstances and cultural traditions between Vietnam 
and Australia, both of us have been looking towards the Pacific 
and identifying ourselves with the common desire for an expanded 
regional cooperation. 
  `We are satisfied with the results of the open and frank 
exchanges of talks between us today. We are convinced that the 
agreement between us in many fields will contribute to further 
consolidation and development of the on-going fine cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia'. 
  Prime Minister Paul Keating, for his part, said: 
  `The effect of the changes you have introduced, combined 
with 
the skill and enterprise of the Vietnamese people, have brought 
this country high levels of economic growth and have opened up 
new opportunities for our bilateral relationship. Australia, 
too, has been through a process of 'economic renovation'. We 
have opened our industry to competition and our economy to the 
world. 
  `I know, Mr Prime Minister, how difficult the task can be. 
But, like you, I also know how large are the rewards for our 
countries at the end of the process. 
  `And, like Vietnam Australia is also seeking closer links 
with our region not only economically but culturally, 
politically and strategically as well. 
  These parallel interests are creating unprecedented new 
opportunities for us. 
  Trade between Australia and Vietnam in 1982 was 2 million 
dollars. In 1993 it was 366 million dollars. 
  Australia is now Vietnam's third largest foreign investor, 
with nearly 800 million dollars invested here. 
  We are also developing new avenues for cooperation on 
regional issues. 
  And Vietnam can count on warm support from Australia as you 
move towards greater involvement in regional organisations. 
  Bilaterally, we are finding new opportunities to work 
together. 
  `I was also pleased to be able to tell you today, Mr Prime 
Minister, that Australia has committed more than 200 million 
dollars in a new four-year aid program, which we hope will cover 
areas such as education, health, infrastructure and legal 
training.

  [Excerpt] Vientiane -- Visiting Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating yesterday urged Laos, a close communist ally of 
North Korea, to help defuse nuclear tension in the Korean 
peninsular, said Foreign Minister Samsavat Lengsavat. 
  The request was raised during Keating's talks with his 
Laotian counterpart Khamtai Siphandon. Laos' response, however, 
was cautious. 
  Somsavat said despite the government's policy fostering 
world 
peace and stability, Vientiane respected countries' individual 
rights to find solutions to their own problems. 
  "We (Laos and North Korea) in fact have good relations. Our 
two countries were the victims of aggression in the past," said 
Somsavat. [passage omitted]

Vietnam last month by Australia's prime minister Paul Keating. 
  Announcing the delegation's makeup, Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans said it would be accompanied by two academics noted for 
their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights and two 
prominent Vietnamese now living in Australia. 
  The academics are Professor Nancy Viviani, dean of faculty 
of 
the Asian studies at Queensland's Griffith University; and 
Professor Philip Olsten, director of the Center for 
International Law at the Australian National University. 
  Senator Evans said Australia had taken up the suggestion 
from 
the Vietnamese prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, made during his 
visit in May last year that Vietnamese Australians should go 
back to Vietnam to see the situation. 
  The foreign minister said the delegation will include Quang 
Luu, head of radio for the Special Broadcasting Service and Ho 
Mai, a Footscray city councillor in Melbourne. 
  Senator Evans said the delegation was a strong, 
well-balanced 
one that had 
both status and expertise.

  [Excerpts] Laotian Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat 
will lead a delegation to Bangkok soon for talks on the 
maintenance and administration of the Thai-Lao Mittraphap bridge 
across the Mekong River, informed sources said. 
  Talks, set tentatively for 8-9 February, will also focus on 
official preparations far His Majesty the King's visit to 
Vientiane on the eve of the historic April 8 opening. 
  The bridge, financed and built by Australia, completes the 
first land link between Thailand and Laos. 
  The opening will be presided over by the King and the 
President of Laos, Nouhak Phomsavan, in the presence of Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, Laotian Prime Minister General Khamtai 
Siphandon, and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  However, the build-up to the handover is being plagued by a 
lack of agreement on the question of boundaries. Visa issues 
have also yet to be settled. [passage omitted] 
  Thailand maintains that the boundary on the bridge should be 
drawn at the deepest point of the river, the same line which 
marks the frontier along the Mekong River between Thailand and 
Laos. 
  Laos has argued that the two nations should each have 
jurisdiction over and responsibility for half the bridge, in 
accordance with international practice. This boundary would not 
replace the official frontier. 
  The differences have embarrassed both sides, as such basic 
issues were supposed to have been smoothed over earlier in 
anticipation of the historic inauguration of the "friendship" 
bridge that symbolizes cordial ties between the two neighbors. 
  The sources however said the talks are unlikely to focus on 
measures to facilitate the two-way entry into both sides through 
the bridge.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 18 (KPL) -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed on April 16 arrived 
here on a three-day official visit to the Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] at the invitation of Lao Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon. 
  The visit was in response to the December 1992 visit of the 
Lao prime minister to Malaysia, where three agreements were 
signed between the two governments concerning investment 
promotion and protection, economic, scientific and technical 
cooperation and air transportation. 
  During the visit, the Malaysian prime minister called on Lao 
President Nouhak Phoumsavan and met with Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon. 
  Talking with the Malaysian prime minister, President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan said this visit was very significant in the history 
of the Lao-Malaysian relations. He expressed hope that the 
bilateral relations would further develop fruitfully in many 
areas. In response, the Malaysian prime minister expressed 
pleasure over a warm hospitality the Lao Government and people 
gave to him and his party. He voiced support to the open-door 
policy of the Lao Government on economic relations and 
cooperation with foreign countries, and confirmed that he would 
do all he could to develop the friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in his discussion with 
his Malaysian counterpart also said that the visit was historic. 
He considered it as implementing the three agreements signed 
between the two governments in 1992. 
  On the same day afternoon, talks were held between the 
government delegations of the two countries headed by their 
respective prime ministers. At the talks, both sides discussed 
a wide range of issues concerning their bilateral cooperation, 
both public and private, in various fields. 
  The two prime ministers then witnessed the signing of an 
agreement on banking settlement between the governors of the 
central banks of the two countries. 
  In the evening, Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon hosted a 
banquet in honour of his Malaysian counterpart. 
  The Malaysian prime minister was officially welcomed at the 
airport by Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon together with 
Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and other members of the Lao Government 
officials. This three-day visit was the first ever made to the 
country by the Malaysian prime minister following the Lao prime 
minister's visit to Malaysia in December 1992. 
  The Malaysian delegation was accompanied by several 
important 
figures in the business circle of Malaysia.

  [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has left 
Australia for Laos to start his Southeast Asian tour. The 
eight-day visit to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam is aimed at 
improving Australia's trade relationship and developing the 
vision that Mr. Keating sees of Australia forging closer ties 
with Asia. 
  Mr. Keating says human rights issues will be raised during 
his visit to Vietnam, but they will be within a set framework. 
He says, as a democracy, Australia will put its views clearly 
and forthrightly, but in the interests of maintaining 
relationship with Asian countries; therefore, the situation had 
to be seen from an overall point of view. 
  One of the high points of Mr. Keating's visit will be to 
hand 
over the Australian-constructed and funded Friendship Bridge 
linking Laos and Thailand over the Mekong River.

  [Text] President Suharto and Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating held two-hour private talks on bilateral ties and 
APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] at Jakarta's Merdeka 
Palace this morning. Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed 
reporters on the details of the meeting: 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders 
exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral, 
regional, and international events, as well as events related to 
APEC after the grouping's meeting in Seattle last year. Several 
points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view 
that ties between Indonesia and Australia have progressed 
smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced 
since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime 
Minister Keating visited Indonesia a few months ago. 
  The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have 
steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of 
visits between the two countries' officials, both at the 
national and regional level. The president pointed out that in 
some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the 
second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe 
that relations between businessmen and private citizens should 
be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two 
countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views 
and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for 
the progress of both countries. 
  The two leaders also discussed matters relating to APEC, as 
well as the APEC leaders' meeting on Blake Island. They noted 
that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful 
for preparations to hold the second APEC summit meeting 
scheduled in Indonesia in November. The Australian prime 
minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to 
make the upcoming APEC meeting successful. That is all I can 
tell you; thank you for your attention. [end recording]

British counterpart, John Major, to use Australia as a trade and 
investment springboard into Asia. Mr. Keating has also raised 
Australia's ongoing trade concerns with Canada in a separate 
meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien. Linda

leaders in London where they are gathering for the commemoration 
of the World War II D-day landing of Normandy 50 years ago. 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Ahead of the D-day ceremony, Mr. 
Keating met with Mr. Major in London with trade and investment 
are key agenda items in what the two leaders have described as a 
strong relationship. Officials say Mr. Keating assured Mr. 
Major that Australia's push for closer economic links with Asia 
did not exclude the Australia-Britain relationship. The 
Australian Government is keen for Britain to use its very high 
level of investment in Australia as a window into Asia. The two 
leaders also discussed the forthcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] leaders' summit in Jakarta and ways of 
advancing the Asia Pacific Economic Grouping. 
  Mr. Keating talked with Canada's Jean Chretien who described 
by officials as equally warm although Mr. Keating noted the 
bilateral relationship had languished somewhat in particular 
over trade tension. Officials described Mr. Keating as putting

  [Text] During their formal meeting at Government House 
today, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating discussed expanding bilateral trade and 
investment cooperation and promoting free trade practices. 
  Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's 
Office, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment 
policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use 
Thailand as an aviation center for Qantas Airlines. The Thai 
side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products 
which have difficulties when imported to Australia and those 
products which were once accused of market dumping by asking 
Australia to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said: 
  [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides 
exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral 
cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade, 
investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two 
sides have recognized the important role of the economic 
cooperation forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation, or APEC, and discussed possible ways to further 
expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the 
possibility of linking economic cooperation between the ASEAN 
Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called 
CER, of which Australia and New Zealand are members. This issue 
has never been brought up for official discussion previously. 
However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further 
actions must be taken in this regard. Thailand itself can bring 
up this matter during ASEAN meetings, while Australia seeks 
consultations with New Zealand as well as members of ASEAN, AFTA 
[ASEAN Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral 
economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides 
agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and 
discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade 
measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of 
others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of 
multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the 
two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the 
security issue. [end recording] 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting, 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak disclosed that the 
two sides agreed to turn APEC into a multilateral economic 
cooperation grouping. Suphachai said: 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral 
cooperation with APEC. The Australian side reiterated its 
concern over this issue. It noted that the United States is 
moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the 
right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are 
involved in any agreement. Australia does not want the United 
States to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is 
doing with Japan. Therefore, Australia asks Thailand to help to 
build up the strength of APEC because APEC was established with 
support from U.S. politicians and economists who support the 
principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see APEC 
lay idle for fear that certain elements in the United States 
might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis. 
Prime Minister Chuan reaffirmed that Thailand has always 
supported and wants to see a strong APEC. However, he suggested 
that APEC apply GATT agreements as soon as possible and try to 
comply with GATT rules. He also noted that APEC members are not 
equally developed like countries in the European Union. This 
issue must also be considered. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, says he is 
ready to establish full diplomatic relations with the United 
States immediately. In a rare interview, Mr. Kiet told Radio 
Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, that 
disputes between the two sides over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnman War presented no hurdles to normal ties. 
And the 71-year old Vietnamese leader indicated his willingness 
to stay at the helm of government for another couple of years, 
despite being past retirement age. From Hanoi, Christoper Kramer 
filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kramer] In his first interview since the 
lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in February, Mr. Kiet spoke 
for almost an hour about regional issues and relations with 
Australia and the United States. He said the recent visit of 
Prime Minister Paul Keating had seen a frank exchange of views 
based on friendship, leading to agreement on bilateral and 
regional issues. 
  Regarding the U.S., Mr. Kiet said the lifting of the embargo 
had improved the conditions for the continuing search for 
American MIA's and the disputes over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnam War presented no obstacles to full 
normalization of relations with Washington. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Vietnam 
intends that the normalized relations between the United States 
and Vietnam inevitably will come. We are ready at any point of 
time for that because the normalized relations between the two 
countries are not only in the interests of the two countries but 
also in the interests of the region and the world over. 
  [Kramer] On the domestic situation, Mr. Kiet said the 
elimination of poverty was his government's main priority. But 
asked whether Vietnam wanted to move toward some form of 
multiparty democracy, he said maintenance of political stability 
was more important. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Looking 
around as well as looking at the situation in Eastern Europe, we 
could see that there is such a lesson. 
  [Kramer] Mr. Kiet did, however, commit the communist party 
to continued political as well as economic reforms. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] We 
clearly see the interrelationship and the mutually supporting 
relationship between the economic reform and the political 
reform -- these two areas are closely linked with each other and 
one gives [word indistinct] for the other. 
  [Kramer] Since Mr. Kiet came to office in 1992, he has 
presided over Vietnam's spectacular return to the world 
community, but on the domestic front he faces a widening gap 
between rich and poor and the daunting task of managing the 
country's transition from communism to free market economy. 
  Along with the president and communist party leader, he is 
widely expected to step down at around the time of the next 
communist party congress late next year or in early 1996. But 
having seen him in action on the tennis court, I can report that 
the prime minister is fighting fit and in no mood to step down. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] If I am 
be able to contribute to the development of the country in line 
with the already identified projects, and if my personal health 
permits me, and if there is a need expressed by the people, then 
I try my best. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] SYDNEY, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten left a meeting with Prime Minister Paul Keating on 
Tuesday without winning Australia's public endorsement of 
Britain's drive for greater democracy in the colony. But Patten 
said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's 
support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was 
delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory 
meeting." 
  Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official 
residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional 
issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) 
group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Patten, who is on a six-day 
official visit at Keating's invitation, told reporters his visit 
was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian 
businesses to use Hong Kong as a springboard to China. [passage 
omitted] 
  Keating has never denied reports that he told Chinese 
Premier 
Li Peng in Beijing last June that Australia did not support 
Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong. "Australia is 
not particularly impressed with Patten's modus operandi or his 
taking an interest in Hong Kong's political situation so late in 
the peace," Keating reportedly said. 
  However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans subsequently told 
parliament that Australia had consistently expressed to both 
China and Britain its "support for democratic reform" consistent 
with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British declaration paving the 
way for Hong Kong's handback in 1997. [passage omitted] 
  An Australian government official said later that the 
meeting 
had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not 
know if Keating had privately endorsed Britain's position. 
  "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to Australia 
of 
Hong Kong's continuing prosperity and stability in the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997," the official said.

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent] </F>
  [Summary] Dear friends: This morning in the capital city 
of Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage paid 
a courtesy call on Acting King [title as heard] Chea Sim. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet was accompanied by Norodum Sirivut, 
Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs 
and international cooperation. Acting King Chea Sim cordially 
received Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage. He 
expressed his gratitude to the Vietnamese Government for its 
constant efforts to help bring about peace in Cambodia. He was 
convinced that this historic visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will contribute to strengthening the friendship between Vietnam 
and Cambodia a step further. He briefed Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet on the current situation in Cambodia and informed him that 
King Norodom Sihanouk's health condition was good and that the 
King would return to Cambodia on 8 April. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
thanked 
the Cambodian leaders for having accorded the Vietnamese 
Government delegation a warm welcome. He assured His Excellency 
Chea Sim of the desire and persistent efforts of the Vietnamese 
Government and people to do all they can to preserve and promote 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia. He expressed his belief that with the 
goodwill and efforts of both sides, these ties will continue to 
be consolidated and developed with each passing day. 
  Afterward, at 0900, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and First 
Prime Minister Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
signed the Vienamese-Cambodian joint communique on the 
conclusion of the visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. The signing ceremony was held at Chamka 
Mon Palace. 
  Next, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and 
Norodom 
Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, signed the agreements on 
cultural, educational, training, and scientific-technological 
cooperation as well as on the establishment of a joint economic, 
cultural, and scientific-technological cooperation committee. 
Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet and Cambodian Commerce 
Minister Va Huot signed the agreements on economic and trade 
cooperation and on goods transit between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the comrades accompanying him 
left Phnom Penh for home this morning. Seeing the Vietnamese 
delegation off at Pochentong International Airport were First 
Minister Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, and many other high-ranking Cambodian 
Government officials. Also on hand to bid farewell to Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage were members of the 
diplomatic corps, representatives of international organizations 
in Phnom Penh, and members of the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia. 
  Prime Minister Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen invited 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to step on a red-carpeted honorary 
stand as a military band played the national anthems of Cambodia 
and Vietnam. Next, the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as the latter reviewed the guard of 
honor and bade farewell to Cambodian and foreign officials. The 
special plane carrying Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the 
comrades accompanying him took off at 1000 sharp. 
  Twenty-four hours is too short for an official friendship 
visit. Yet, thanks to the positive efforts of both sides, this 
visit brought about fine results and opened a new step in the 
development of relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating is on his 
way to Jakarta this afternoon with his eyes firmly set on what 
he calls one of Australia's most important international 
relationships. The focus on the interests the two countries 
share in the Asia-Pacific means that the Indonesian media 
crackdown is well down on the Keating agenda. Mr. Keating is 
under pressure from some Australian lobby groups to take 
Indonesia to task after Jakarta last week closed the country's 
three leading weekly news magazines -- TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK. 
But the prime minister says he'll be using his informal talk 
with President Suharto tomorrow to discuss the APEC [Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation] Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in 
Jakarta in November. Mr. Keating told Graeme Dobell that the 
Suharto government's closure of its three leading news magazines 
was a backward step during a period of rapid change: 
  [Begin recording] [Keating] Indonesia is like many countries 
in the region; it's in a state of constant change where there 
are many imperatives starting to impact on the country: the 
growth imperative and all that brings with it for change, and 
diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt that these 
are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone days as 
they are now. For our part, Gareth Evans as foreign minister 
has made clear Australia's disappointment about the fact that 
these [word indistinct] have been changed. But again, from our 
point of view, I mean there are the same, similar things -- 
there is press control in China and we're still doing trade with 
China, there is a fairly tight control of the press in Malaysia 
and we are still doing trade with Malaysia. I think, you know, 
this relationship now has many links to it and it does give us 
the opportunity, I think, to, you know, maintain a working 
relationship despite some of these things which are 
disappointments to us. 
  [Dobell] Does it symbolize [words indistinct] to put on the 
brakes? Is it a step back from the policy of openness that 
President Suharto has been talking about? 
  [Keating] Well, I think it may be that we will witness in 
many countries similar to Indonesia -- such as Indonesia, 
similar to Indonesia -- that there'll be, you know, (?full) four 
steps forward and one back and four forward and one back and 
then I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong 
public opinion -- reactions -- about this, where there is any 
crimp on information, wherever it occurs in most places, and I 
understand this to be the case in Indonesia as well. 
  [Dobell] One of the comments from Jakarta has been from the 
head of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, Abdulraham 
Wahid, who said that he thought you, as a friend, should speak 
to the president on this. Do you have a duty perhaps as a 
friend to speak to Suharto on this? 
  [Keating] Australia is not the international news and media 
plurality policeman. Now, there is a sort of view around that 
because we have a very free press we ought to be arguing for a 
press similar to ours wherever we go. Well, we are an open and 
plural country and that's part of our strength, and we're also 
very forthright. But, you know, I mean I could make my next 
visit to China. The first item on the agenda I'll put press 
freedom and plurality. We [words indistinct] first agenda item 
no one should choose. [End recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Mission to Asia"] </F>
  [Text] After the black comedy of Mr Keating's mad 
squabble with the Vietnam veterans, readers will be relieved to 
hear that there was a serious purpose to the Prime Minister's 
visit to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and that, by all accounts, 
it went quite well. 
  The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship 
Bridge over the Mekong River on the border of Thailand and Laos. 
  The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen 
Australia's relations with two of the most important nations in 
the region. 
  In Australia, the political focus naturally has been on the 
Vietnamese part of the trip because Vietnam is the flavour of 
the month, because of the row with the veterans and because this 
is the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since the war. 
  However, that should not be allowed to overshadow the 
importance of the visit to Thailand. By far the biggest economy 
on Mr. Keating's itinerary, Thailand is also of growing 
strategic and diplomatic importance to Australia. 
  Economically, diplomatically and militarily, Thailand is a 
major player in ASEAN and a friendly rival of ASEAN's other 
major players, Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  For Australia, that makes Thailand a particularly important 
friend. The Thais' shrewd and predictable diplomacy and their 
distance from Australia mean that Australian-Thai relations tend 
to be more stable than our relations with Malaysia and 
Indonesia. (Curiously, distance does seem to be an important 
factor; for example, Thailand's human rights lapses seem to 
attract less attention here than Indonesia's.) At moments of 
tension between Australia and Malaysia or Indonesia, the Thais 
have interceded on Australia's behalf. 
  Thailand is a longstanding friend and an alternative 
diplomatic and economic "gateway" to the region, always ready to 
accept Australian investment and trade if other countries are 
not so inclined. That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on 
Australia's relations with its more volatile ASEAN neighbours. 
  With its well-developed defence forces (including 
significant 
naval forces) and its borders with Cambodia and Laos, Thailand 
is also an important player in the development of Cambodia and 
Indo-China. 
  Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic. 
  Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long-term 
potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to 
come. 
  Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential 
importance in the region, mainly because of its large and 
well-educated population and its border with China. 
  The Chinese are paranoid about Vietnam, which is why they 
spent a fortune to support the Khmer Rouge on Vietnam's 
south-western flank. 
  The central objective of Western policy towards Vietnam must 
be the country's successful economic and political integration 
into the international community. 
  Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to 
rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is 
insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich 
natural resources and to create employment in labour-intensive 
manufacturing. 
  The Vietnamese Communist Party is terrified of the kind of 
political instability that has plagued Eastern Europe, and with 
good reason. Vietnam's young population (the median age is 19) 
means that the labour force is growing at a rate of 1 million a 
year. The rationalisation of inefficient State-owned industries 
means that jobs will be scarce for a good while yet. 
  Australia's policy is both to contribute to Vietnam's 
development and to share in it. 
  As aid projects, Mr Keating's proposed high-profile projects 
-- including a $100 million bridge over the Mekong River and the 
preservation of Hanoi's historic architecture -- sound as 
questionable as the Hawke Government's Friendship Bridge that 
Mr. Keating went to Asia to open. 
  However, Mr Keating obviously expects the political and 
economic benefits to Australia of the projects (in terms of 
goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly 
competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in 
their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people. 
  Of course, other countries are also trying to share in the 
Vietnamese revival. Mr Keating was the sixth leader and the 
14th senior politician to visit Vietnam in a month. 
  For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of Mr. 
Keating's visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated. 
  Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant, 
positive step in the development of Australian-Vietnamese 
relations.
