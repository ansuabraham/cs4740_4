APOLLO 20 YEARS LATER 




By BEN SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 




Twenty years ago this week, the United States' Apollo 11 spacecraft landed the 
first humans on the surface of the moon, fulfilling a dream shared by poets and 
presidents. 


That accomplishment stands as one of the great feats of modern science and is 
one whose legacy continues to be felt today. 


"Other than the pyramids, I don't know what other accomplishment by man even 
compares with it," said Christopher Kraft, former director of Apollo mission 
operations. 


When Astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, he did 
more than fulfill President John F. Kennedy's bold promise of 1961 to land a 
man on the moon before the end of the decade. Coming at a time of political and 
social turmoil, the landing unified a nation and provided some much-needed 
heroes -- most notably the Apollo 11 crew, Armstrong, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin 
Jr. and Michael Collins. 


But there were others among Apollo's 200,000 scientists, engineers and 
technicians who were the unknown, unseen heroes. They fought the lesser-known 
but critical battles of technology at a time when computerization was in its 
infancy, and they won. If they had not, the mission might have ended in 
disaster or there might have been no Apollo at all. 


Gerry Elverum was one of those people. 


In 1961, Elverum was an engineer at TRW in Inglewood designing rocket engines 
that he hoped would someday be used in space. 


The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had already decided to use 
the Gargantuan Saturn 5 engines to launch Apollo vehicles out of the Earth's 
atmosphere, but bringing a manned craft down to the moon's surface would 
require the development of an additional engine capable of controlled descent. 


Elverum thought he had that engine. 


Because it would serve as both a brake and booster for the descent vehicle, 
Elverum's design allowed the thrust and direction of the engine to be adjusted 
by the vehicle's occupants. Should the need to change landing locations arise 
midway through descent, the astronauts would be able to modify the speed and 
trajectory of the craft accordingly. 


Although not involved in the original bidding process for the descent engine, 
Elverum and a team from TRW approached NASA contractors with their plans. 


"We have an idea for how that engine ought to really be made, and we want to 
talk to you about it," Elverum told the contractors. 


The contractors listened and, based on engine designs Elverum had made for much 
smaller vehicles and positive test results achieved with their scaled-up 
versions, eventually awarded TRW the contract for the only engines that have 
ever landed men on the moon. 


"That was a very intense time period," recalled Elverum, now a senior 
propulsion engineer at TRW. "We were not a known name in propulsion at that 
time . . . but we submitted a proposal and, lo and behold, we won." 


On the day of the Apollo 11 landing, Elverum and his crew were stationed at a 
test facility in Bethpage, N.Y., where they monitored a full-scale mock-up of 
the Apollo lander. Should anything go wrong with the engine during descent, 
they would be asked to give technical advice to the astronauts in space. 


"In other words, if they were pushing buttons and the engines didn't start, we 
could in real time look at all the stuff and say, 'Here, try this, try that,' " 
Elverum explained. 


The engines performed flawlessly, however, responding on cue, even when 
Armstrong was forced seconds before touchdown to take manual control of the 
descent to avoid landing in a boulder field. Toggling the engine's control 
switch, a feature which Elverum had included in the design, Armstrong landed 
the craft safely, away from the lunar boulders. As Armstrong would later 
comment on the landing, the engine performed without a hitch. 


In years to come, the engine would be used successfully for tasks it was never 
designed to perform, as witnessed in the aborted Apollo 13 moon mission in 
1970. 


On that mission, an oxygen tank attached to the craft's service module exploded 
halfway to the moon, leaving the three astronauts drifting in space. Using the 
landing vehicle as a lifeboat, however, the astronauts were able to swing 
around the moon and direct the craft back to Earth, using Elverum's engine as 
their only propulsion. 


"When it was called on, the engine worked. You feel good about that," Elverum 
said. "When life gets tough, you can always look back and say there was 
something that worked and we accomplished it." 


If not for the split-second decision of another relatively unknown Apollo 11 
player, however, Elverum's engine might never have had the chance to perform so 
perfectly in the first place. 


Before beginning its final descent to the moon's surface, the Apollo 11 lander, 
called Eagle, experienced a series of problems in its communication and 
navigational systems. 


After several hours in orbit around the moon while still attached to the Apollo 
command module and another period of orbit after separation, "everything looked 
fairly OK," said Steven Bales, who was the mission's 26-year-old guidance 
officer stationed back on Earth. 


As Eagle circled around from the dark side of the moon, preparing to begin the 
final descent process, "the communications were dropping in and out . . . and 
there were indications, ever so subtle, that possibly the down-range (landing) 
distance was a little off," Bales said. 


Ground control crews considered the problems manageable, however, and the 
lander was given permission to begin its descent. But within moments, Bales 
noticed that Eagle's navigational computer was registering a descent rate of 
about 20 feet per second slower than the module was actually traveling. 


Had the discrepancy grown to 35 feet per second, it would have disrupted 
navigation to the point where the descent would have to be aborted altogether, 
Bales said. But because it remained constant, he was able to give the go-ahead 
for the process to continue. 


But no sooner did that crisis pass than a systems alarm in Eagle began to 
sound, indicating more trouble with the vehicle's computer. The alarm, known as 
a "12 02" warning, showed that because of an informational overload, the 
computer was not completing some necessary calculations. 


"Here we are in the middle of the descent, we had just had a navigational 
concern and . . . we hear this program alarm. It was really a shock," Bales 
said. 


By chance, a similar problem had arisen in a simulation of the landing a few 
weeks earlier, and it had been determined that if the alarms came infrequently 
enough, the landing would not necessarily have to be aborted. The definition of 
infrequent, however, was left to the flight controller's discretion and a 
go/no-go decision based on the alarms would essentially be a judgment call. 


"So in a period of about 20 seconds I made up my mind that it was OK to 
continue," Bales explained. 


Although six more computer alarms cropped up over the next several minutes, 
Bales stuck by his decision, and after about 15 minutes, he and others back on 
Earth heard the static-tinged voice of Armstrong announce: "Houston, 
Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." 


With the thousands of workers involved in the lunar program, it is not 
surprising that the majority have gone unrecognized. Aldrin himself, though 
known by millions of Americans as Armstrong's only companion in the Eagle 
lander, is destined to be remembered as the second man to set foot on the moon. 
People "want to say that (I) feel bad because he went out first, but I think 
it's small people who say that," Aldrin said. 


However, he is also the person who called out altitude and directional readings 
for Armstrong when problems in the Eagle's navigational computer forced a 
manual landing. Without that information, such a descent would probably have 
been impossible and could have ended in tragedy. 


Although after touchdown Aldrin followed Armstrong out onto the surface of the 
moon by less than 20 minutes, it is Armstrong's name, not Aldrin's, which comes 
to mind when recalling the historic landing and subsequent moon walk. 


In the years after Apollo 11, Aldrin has acknowledged that he developed a 
substance abuse problem in coping with the impact of the moon landing on his 
life and underwent psychiatric treatment for depression related to it. Now 
recovered, Aldrin said he holds no bitterness about his involvement in the moon 
program or about the lesser position he held on that mission. 


"Right now I'm very satisfied with my ability to project my talents to be very 
useful in the space program," he said. 


But like many involved in the Apollo program, Aldrin questions whether future 
space accomplishments can match Apollo's intensity and excitement. 


"Project Apollo was the single most audacious endeavor in human history," he 
wrote several years after the landing. "When future generations remember 
Apollo, just as we now recall the voyages of Columbus . . . they will remember 
(that) in July, 1969, people like themselves first set foot on the moon."

NEWSMAKERS: MOON TRIP NOW JUST A CHIP SHOT 




By SHIRLEY MARLOW 




Landing on the moon was child's play as astronaut Michael Collins led 
schoolchildren on a simulated space trip, commemorating the 20th anniversary of 
man's first steps on the lunar surface. Collins and students from Prince 
George's County, Md., schools were linked by television satellite to a mock-up 
mission control manned by astronaut Charles Duke and students at the Houston 
Museum of Natural History in Texas. Duke was the "capcom," or capsule 
communicator, when Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. set foot on 
the moon July 20, 1969. Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot, orbited 
the moon while his crew mates romped on the lunar surface. During the 
simulation at a high-tech science education center in Greenbelt, Md., Collins 
and the students used computers to gather moon rocks, build and launch a space 
probe, analyze lunar samples, monitor life support systems and operate robots 
and lunar rovers. "They had a good landing. They're a team of real 
professionals," Collins said of the students. "We're ready to hire them." 


 -- This time it's personal for Richard M. Nixon. For the first time, the 
former President will describe in detail his experiences in resigning the 
presidency and his life in retirement in an autobiography due next spring. "It 
is the most personal book I have ever written," Nixon, 76, said in a statement. 
Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, would not disclose terms of the contract 
but said it plans a first printing of at least 200,000 and a major marketing 
campaign. Nixon has pledged his income from the book to the Nixon Library and 
Birthplace, scheduled to open next year at Yorba Linda, Calif. 


 -- Seventy years after the death of Nicholas II, about 200 people gathered in 
a monastery graveyard in Moscow to hold the first public Requiem in the Soviet 
Union for the czar who was shot, along with his family, by Bolshevik guards in 
July, 1918. Worshipers defied repeated orders by police to leave the prayer 
meeting conducted by Russian Orthodox priests at Donskoi Monastery. The 
unofficial Commission on the Remains of the Russian Imperial is calling for the 
remains of the royal family to be given Christian burials in the Peter and Paul 
Fortress in Leningrad, traditional resting place for Romanov royalty, Vladimir 
Anishchenko, a commission member, said. Monarchists have contacted Grand Prince 
Vladimir Kirillovich, ranking member of the Romanov family, who lives in 
England. "He just came back to life when he heard about our activity," 
Anishchenko said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

MORNING REPORT: TELEVISION 




By Claudia Puig, Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press. 




The executive producer of a CBS documentary on man's first walk on the moon in 
1969 said the program mistakenly showed clips taken on the moon during a 1972 
flight. The program said the 1972 footage was of the historic first moon walk 
by American astronauts. "It was an honest mistake," Perry Wolff said Friday of 
the error in "The Moon Above, the Earth Below," a two-hour special that aired 
Thursday and saluted the 20th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon 
flight. The program was co-anchored by Dan Rather and Charles Kuralt. Two 
scenes showed two astronauts -- ostensibly Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin -- 
bouncing on the moon's surface, and then their lunar orbiter blasting off from 
the moon. In a brief interview, Wolff said he had just learned that they 
actually were from the Apollo 17 flight in December, 1972. No deception was 
intended, he emphasized. He blamed the error on a "mislabeled tape" taken from 
a box of more than 100 tapes of footage of moon flights and landings. Claudia 
Puig

ISAAC ASIMOV: MOON HOLDS CLUES TO EARTH'S DISTANT PAST 




By Isaac Asimov 




Twenty years ago this week, on July 20, 1969, human beings set foot for the 
first time on a world other than Earth itself. Neil Armstrong stepped down onto 
the moon's surface and said, "This is one small step for a man, one giant leap 
for mankind." 


There were five more visits to the moon in the next few years, and then they 
stopped. No one has visited the moon now in 17 years. So as we celebrate the 
20th anniversary of that first moon landing, we might ask: What was it all for? 
Did we get anything out of it? Was there really a giant leap? 


Well, yes; the moon landings gave us a valuable chance to learn about its -- 
and our -- far past. 


The Earth and the moon, and the whole solar system, in fact, came into being 
about 4.5 billion years ago. We can learn about the Earth's distant past by 
studying its rock formations. Naturally, the older the rock and the longer it 
has existed in Earth's crust unchanged, the further back our knowledge can be 
pushed. 


However, the key word there is unchanged. Rocks don't remain unchanged forever. 
The Earth's crust shifts and rocks are crushed and melted and reformed. The 
force of moving air and water introduces changes even when the rocks aren't 
actually melted. And life itself changes the landscape enormously. 


The result is that the oldest rocks we can find are a little more than 3 
billion years old and there aren't many of those. We have difficulty extending 
our knowledge of Earth's history back that far, and as for the first 1.5 
billion years of Earth's existence, forget it. It remains a complete blank, and 
as long as we are imprisoned on Earth itself, it will continue to remain a 
complete blank. 


The moon, however, is a smaller body. Its gravitational pull is insufficient to 
hold an atmosphere or any liquid that evaporates easily. That means there is no 
air on the moon, and no water, and no life. Not only is there none now, but 
there never was any. That, in turn, means that the surface has not been 
interfered with by the action of life or by wind or by waves. What's more, 
being a smaller body, the moon has developed less internal heat, and it is 
internal heat that keeps the crust moving and changing even if nothing else 
does. In other words, whereas the Earth is geologically "alive," the moon is 
virtually geologically "dead." 


This means the surface of the moon can continue to exist unchanged for much 
longer than the surface of the Earth can, and the moon rocks that the 
astronauts brought back are a billion years older than the oldest rocks we can 
find on Earth's surface. We can fill in a billion years of early history that 
the Earth is silent about. 


The moon was created (it is currently thought) when, very early in Earth's 
history, the planet was clobbered by an object about the size of Mars. That 
knocked a huge quantity of Earth's surface layers into nearby space while the 
striking body fused with Earth. 


The material that was knocked into space was heated to a vapor but it cooled 
into a mass of innumerable particles of various sizes and these gradually 
coalesced and formed the moon. Since the moon was formed from the outer layers 
of Earth, it is almost entirely rocky and includes very little dense iron like 
that found at the Earth's core. That is why the moon is less dense than Earth. 


It took a few hundred million years for the moon to cool down sufficiently to 
have a solid crust, but about 4 billion years ago that solid crust was there, 
and the oldest rocks that have been brought back date from that period. 


In the last 4 billion years, the only significant changes undergone by the moon 
happened when it gathered in the remaining objects that still existed in its 
vicinity. These formed the numerous craters and the vast "seas" that now cover 
its surface. From the rocks we have brought back, we can study the different 
stages of that bombardment. The early history was the most active, of course, 
since there were still many objects with which to collide. 


As time went on, space was cleared of most of the objects and the moon settled 
down and underwent fewer and fewer other changes. From about 3.2 billion years 
ago onward, things were relatively quiet -- for Earth as well as the moon, for 
if the moon was bombarded, so was the Earth. It's just that on Earth the 
craters produced by that bombardment have worn away, thanks to winds, waves and 
life, whereas on the moon they remain. 


Yet there have been changes on the moon comparatively recently, too. The crater 
of Copernicus was formed 810 million years ago, and the spectacular crater of 
Tycho was formed only 109 million years ago. Some small craters were formed as 
recently as 2 million years ago. 


If we were to go back to the moon, then, quite apart from its uses as an 
observatory, a mining station and a new home for human beings, a careful and 
painstaking study of its surface could fill in all the details of its history 
and from that we could deduce what took place on the early Earth, too.

8-FOOT TIDE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND 




By JAMES ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




This is an unusual weekend. Not only did it start with Friday the 13th, it is 
continuing tonight with a full moon that is an astronomical oddity: a Hunter's 
Moon. 


Although the typical beach-goer probably would not notice, the tide off Orange 
County is unusually high this weekend, about eight feet, as opposed to the more 
typical five to six feet. 


High tides today will be at 9:05 a.m. and 9:54 p.m. Low tides will be 2:54 a.m. 
and 3:41 p.m. 


The high tide is produced by the full moon. The moon Saturday night is known as 
the Hunter's Moon because at this time of year it rises soon after sunset, 
making the day seem longer and giving hunters more hours of light to catch 
their prey. 


During a full moon the Earth, sun and moon are aligned, with the sun and moon 
on opposite sides of the Earth, explained Cal State Fullerton physics professor 
Fred M. Johnson. When all three are aligned, Johnson said, they create an 
"additive" effect in which the gravitational attraction of the sun and the moon 
on the earth are combined, creating the high tides. 


Lifeguards at Newport Beach said the tide was two or three feet higher than 
normal Friday, but that would not be dangerous unless accompanied by heavy 
surf.

TRAVELING IN STYLE; 


'NOW BOARDING AT GATE 12, SPACE AIRWAYS' FLIGHT 1-A, NONSTOP TO THE MOON'; 


LUNAR HOLIDAY; 


ALTHOUGH PURELY SPECULATIVE, THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT 
SUCH A SCENARIO IS BOTH LOGICAL AND PROBABLE AND ALSO INVOLVES THE AUTHOR'S 
EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE AEROSPACE AND TRAVEL INDUSTRIES. 




By WILLIS PLAYER, Player is a former senior vice-president and assistant to the 
chairman of Pan American Airways with duties that included the space program. 




When we see the Space Shuttle launched, view color images from Neptune or 
listen to tales of space travel, it's a reminder that one day in the 
not-too-distant future we could be taking vacations on the moon. 


Does that prospect seem outlandish -- or out-worldish? 


If you're a prudent bettor, don't wager against it. Odds are you'll lose, just 
as a half-century ago you'd have lost if you had bet that transoceanic 
vacations would never become commonplace. 


The fact is, it's well within the realm of possibility to create a lunar colony 
and a transportation system to support it. 


In science fiction, rockets have been the favorite way to ride the imagination 
to the moon and beyond, although wooden vessels suspended from balloons and 
blown by cosmic winds have had their partisans. 


By the late 1940s, engineers, scientists and aerospace executives were starting 
to make serious proposals for real rocket ships and real space cities to be 
served by them. 


Today, rocket launchings monopolize space flight, and there are a lot of them; 
in 1988, the Soviet Union alone launched 89 space missions. Rockets that will 
be bigger or better or both are on the way. 


Yet the chances are that when you take your holiday on the moon, you'll not be 
borne there on the flame and thunder of a rocket. A better way is being dreamed 
up in labs and workshops around the world -- in Great Britain and the United 
States, in the Soviet Union and Japan. The better way is a moon plane that, 
within Earth's atmosphere, will behave much like the airplanes you ride today. 


In appearance the moon plane will combine the familiar with the alien. Its 
shapes and surfaces will be somewhat unfamiliar, but you will be able to 
recognize it as a plane. 


Over the objections of today's airmen, it will have no windows, not even a 
windshield. You can have a sturdier, simpler hull, easier to build, if you do 
without them, and for surveillance, electronic scanners and other sensors will 
better serve the purpose. 


When you board you'll find no conventional seats. Instead, you'll see what look 
like the progeny of a marriage between a recliner, and, well, a mummy case, one 
for each passenger. Each module will be operable by its occupant as well as by 
the flight attendants. 


In addition to being an unconventional seat (or, at your preference, a bed) 
your moon-flight module will serve as a substitute for the anchor of gravity, 
to keep you from going adrift. It will also be your purveyor of services. 


Within your self-contained module you'll access food and drink, manage your 
ambient temperature, operate the built-in sanitary facilities, select a range 
of postures, control your view screen, select entertainment channels and, of 
course, communicate with the cabin crew and with your traveling companions. 


You'll go to the moon by plane rather than be lofted by rocket because rockets 
have the oddity that they cannot "breathe" the oxygen in the atmosphere as a 
jet engine can. 


So even with oxygen all around them in the atmosphere, they must carry a large 
amount with them to power their ascent. They must stand poised on tiptoe, focus 
their energies beneath them and blast themselves off like controlled bombs. 
Their lift-off is a managed explosion. 


Few transportation professionals are content with the prospect of trying to 
offer fare-paying passengers regularly scheduled service aboard that sort of 
volcanic contrivance. 


With an air-breathing power plant, the moon plane will make a conventional 
takeoff, gently transferring its load from wheels to wings and then ascending 
at a comfortable gradient through the atmosphere. 


To maneuver in airless space, the plane will use small thrusters similar to 
those on some of today's spacecraft. 


Once in space you'll not be confined to your module. You'll be encouraged to 
emerge from it to experience the fun of floating with the aid of guidelines and 
handholds and under the tutelage of the flight attendants. With a little 
practice, turning a somersault in mid-nothing will become almost as easy as 
opening and closing your eyes. 


But that will be only your second-favorite in-flight entertainment. Your first 
will be watching Earth recede and moon approach on your vision screen. 


Long-range scanners will let you glimpse such sights as low-orbit space 
stations or a space tug outbound to retrieve a crippled satellite for repair. 
Generally, though, your flight path will stay well clear of other activities 
and objects. At space speeds, even a collision with an object the size of an 
aspirin tablet could be catastrophic. 


Regularly scheduled passenger flights will traverse space ways that are 
cleaned, protected and controlled. That means that the principal space-faring 
nations will have devised an agency to operate space ways and to guard them 
from space litter, of which, believe it or not, there already is a dismally 
large accumulation. 


The moon plane will take about 20 hours to reach the orbiting transfer station, 
from which tourists will descend by ferry to the lunar surface. 


You will not be dragging along suitcases full of clothes. Weight, energy and 
storage space will not be wasted that way (a concept many a traveler has wished 
could be applied to Earth transportation). You can keep what you wore to the 
moon and wear it back, but on the moon you will wear simple garments of 
space-age fabrics that stay there and are recycled there. 


We do not yet know whether there is ice on the moon to convert to water. What 
is certain is that it will be more efficient to convert moon matter for use 
than to transport necessities such as water from Earth. Energy probably will be 
supplied from solar sources. You will inhabit ecosystems that will function 
through recycling and renewal rather than through consumption and replacement. 


In truth, they will be small re-creations of our Earth environment, but to 
preserve them we shall have to treat them far more sensibly than we now do 
Earth's environment. In doing so, we will perhaps learn how to treat Earth's 
better, too. 


The moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth's. If you can drive a golf 
ball 200 yards on Earth, you'll be dismayed when you hit it quite out of sight 
on a lunar course -- unless you're allowed to use brightly colored, 
basketball-size golf balls. 


A golf course on the moon? Maybe, maybe not. But don't forget that in addition 
to its educational and recreational value, moon tourism, like tourism on Earth, 
will be important to economic development. 


Moon tourism will be fostered because it will help to pay the expenses of other 
activities, such as the movement of cargo -- supplies outbound and products 
inbound. The vast scale of investment that will be made in tourist plant and 
services on the moon is foreshadowed by those made, for example, in today's 
theme parks. 


Moon tourists will have opportunities to observe science experiments, 
manufacturing processes, medical research and the workings of life-support 
systems. 


There will be tours of the austere landscape, but the visit that almost 
everyone will want to make will be to the spot where Neil Armstrong and Edwin 
(Buzz) Aldrin in 1969 became the first representatives of the human race to set 
foot on the moon -- and where they left a United States flag to mark the 
occasion. 


On some of the excursions tourists will wear spacesuits that will be 
self-contained, single-person mobile habitations. Most excursions, however, 
will be conducted in vehicles with complete life-support systems for groups of 
tourists. 


But the main attraction will be Earth-viewing, not only for its heart-stopping 
beauty but for the chance to view and learn about our planet in ways never 
before possible. 


Today's Space Shuttle must bore a long, super-hot tunnel through the atmosphere 
until the friction of re-entry retards the craft enough to permit a landing. 
The moon plane will make re-entry humdrum, perhaps by using power brakes, 
perhaps by losing energy by skipping, like a stone on a pond, upon the surface 
of the atmosphere. Then its air-breathing engines will let it land just like an 
airplane. 


Already, preliminary work is in progress in a number of countries on such a 
moon plane, or at least its forerunner. 


The British call their space plane concept HOTOL for Horizontal Take Off and 
Landing. The British government has authorized two companies, British Aerospace 
and Rolls-Royce, to seek an international partnership to turn the concept into 
reality. 


The American forerunner is called the X-30 and is funded by the Department of 
Defense, NASA and individual private manufacturers. The Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, which manages the program, says that a prototype 
could fly by 1999. 


The Soviets and, lately, the Japanese -- the latter already having come up with 
artists' renditions of imagined lunar hotels -- also are working toward regular 
moon flights. 


To preview that future, think back a moment to the aerial conquest of the 
Pacific. The air space over the Pacific was more mysterious then than cislunar 
space (between Earth and the moon) is now. Flying the Pacific seemed more 
impossible than the project to put humans on the moon later was to appear. 
Newspaper, radio and newsreel accounts of the day reflected amazement, even 
disbelief, that the deed could be done at all. 


In less than a lifetime, the impossible became the commonplace. And that's the 
realistic way to look at your own prospects for vacationing on the moon.

Twenty-five years ago, one of the greatest human adventures of the 20th
century reached its climax. The Apollo 11 moon landing was a milestone in
history, a feat of technological brilliance which promised to usher in a
golden age of discovery and exploration.
Yet now that much of the glamour of space exploration has faded, mention of
the Apollo programme often prompts the question: 'what was it for?' Did the
astronauts' landing in an airless, barren wilderness really advance the
human race? How could any endeavour, however heroic, justify a total cost of
some Dollars 24bn?
In this age of financial realism, questions about the justification of the
space programme are often answered in terms of its practical benefits.
Without space exploration, 'the quality of life in the US today would be
inconceivable', according to a recent US newspaper advertisement by
Lockheed, the missiles and space company. 'Countless technologies - things
we take for granted today, from automobile design to sewage treatment - owe
their origins to space,' it says.
The technical innovations that stemmed from the Apollo programme pushed
forward the state of electronics, materials science, rocketry and computer
software. The demands of the space venture to reduce the weight of equipment
provided the catalyst for the development of the transistor and synthetic
substances such as Kevlar and Fiberite, which are used for strong
lightweight materials.
Microwave ovens and weather forecasting satellites are also examples of
sophisticated gadgetry which have emerged as a result of equipment developed
for the space programme. The coating designed to reduce aerodynamic drag on
the return capsule has been used on the bottom of racing yachts. Estee
Lauder uses the digital image analyser software designed to map the depth of
the moon's craters to measure skin wrinkles.
But the potential value of such technological spin-offs played little part
in persuading President John Kennedy to launch the Apollo mission,
originally characterised as 'non-military, non-commercial (and)
non-scientific' by his officials. The driving force behind Kennedy's
decision was the desire to boost national pride and to compete with Russia's
space programme in the face of cold war tensions.
'The primary reason to go the moon was the huge psychological benefit, in
terms of national self-confidence,' says Lewis Branscomb of Harvard
University, who presided over a committee that reported on the scientific,
economic and psychological benefits of the Apollo programme in 1967.
'The main reason was international political competition,' says John
Logsdon, a historian at George Washington University. 'Space was used as an
arena for symbolic competition between communism and capitalism.'
But once the initial awe at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's achievement wore off, the agency sought to sustain
political support through stressing the economic spin-offs of the space
launches.
For instance, a study in 1975 by Chase Econometrics, a research group, found
that a Dollars 1m R&amp;D expenditure each year for 10 years by Nasa would
produce a 14-fold return for the wider economy.
Mathematica, another US research group, also found a justification for
Nasa's R&amp;D spending (in 1966, its peak year, the agency's spending accounted
for 13 per cent of total US R&amp;D expenditure). It examined the agency's
influence on speeding up the development of a number of technologies,
including integrated circuits and a computer programme for analysing large
structures.
However, these findings have been criticised. Henry Hertzfeld, senior
research associate at the Space Policy Institute in Washington, argues that
the economic models 'were not sufficiently robust' to ensure the accuracy of
the studies.
Moreover, some observers doubt whether it is possible to isolate the
influence of Nasa's R&amp;D spending. John Logsdon, for example, questions
whether you can 'disentangle what superficially can be attributed to Apollo
while there was a military developing advanced weaponry at the same time'.
Ultimately, attempts to provide a cost-benefit analysis for space
exploration founder on the complexity of quantifying the prestige, economic
benefits and scientific advances arising from the Apollo missions.
Instead, the outcome of the Apollo programme tends to be seen in a more
emotional light. For many people, its most valuable legacy was the
perspective on the earth provided by photographs from the moon: the image of
a blue, fragile globe against an infinite black backdrop of space has
assumed a symbolic importance.
For others, the achievement of setting foot on the moon is viewed in
spiritual terms, as a fulfilment of mankind's fundamental urge to seek new
frontiers.
Set against these grand, abstract ideals, attempts to apply economic
analysis to the space programme risk being treated with scorn. 'The
programme's not about little technical gains, developing Teflon and Velcro,'
says Buzz Aldrin, one of the astronauts on Apollo 11. 'That's not why we
went to the moon.'

ORANGE COUNTY GAVE A BIG PUSH IN DRIVE TO REACH THE MOON 




By DAVID OLMOS and THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writers 




In the early-morning darkness of a spring day in 1969, a convoy carrying a 
strange-looking cargo pulled out of a Rockwell International facility and 
snaked its way along Seal Beach Boulevard to the nearby Navy dock. 


The trucks and trailers were transporting a large section of the huge Saturn V 
rocket that would take man to the moon -- and back to Earth -- for the first 
time ever. 


The booster rocket, placed on its side aboard a specially built transporter, 
was so large that power lines had to be lifted and street lights twisted out of 
the way to allow the convoy to pass. It was then loaded onto a barge at the 
Navy dock for a long journey to the launch pad at Cape Kennedy (now Cape 
Canaveral), Fla. 


On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft lifted off with astronauts Neil A. 
Armstrong, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. and Michael Collins aboard, and on July 
20, 1969, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon. 


"Having a role in something as important, as elegant and as challenging as 
putting a man on the moon was very satisfying," said William Dean, 59, who 
supervised the engineers and technicians who worked around the clock to perfect 
Rockwell's portion of the spacecraft. "We knew we were part of something that 
would be recorded in history as a milestone as important as almost anything 
that had happened in mankind." 


Dean was just one of thousands of Orange County workers who helped put the 
first men on the moon. At a time when "Midnight Cowboy" was playing on local 
movie screens and "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In" was perched atop the TV 
ratings, county aerospace workers were designing and building some of the key 
hardware for Apollo 11's half-million-mile journey to the moon. The Orange 
County operations of Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas and TRW Inc. performed major 
work on Apollo 11, and dozens of smaller local subcontractors made 
contributions too. 




Three Stages 


Because no single rocket was powerful enough to carry a spacecraft to the moon 
by itself, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration devised a plan for 
three rockets, or stages, that would be strapped together. Each stage would be 
discarded after it performed its task. 


Rockwell plants in Seal Beach and Downey built Saturn V's second-stage rocket, 
which would propel the craft to an altitude of 103 nautical miles, then be 
jettisoned so that the third stage could take over. (The first-stage rocket 
would launch Apollo 11, then quickly fall away.) Rockwell also built monitoring 
and control systems for the spacecraft. 


The third-stage rocket was built by McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach. That 
rocket would bring the spacecraft into an orbit around the Earth, then fire its 
engines again to propel the craft toward the moon. 


The TRW San Juan Capistrano plant developed the engines used to lower the 
landing module to the surface of the moon. 




Exciting Time 


The men and women who were part of the Apollo space program remember it as a 
time of hard work and extraordinary challenge, and they recalled the excitement 
of participating in what perhaps would be the most daring exploration ever 
undertaken. 


"In those days, everyone was so busy and spirits were so high that it was 
really a wonderful place to work," said George V. Butler, an executive in 
McDonnell Douglas's space division in Huntington Beach during the Apollo 
program. "Those were some of the best years." 


President John F. Kennedy had issued the challenge to the nation in 1961: Land 
a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Indeed, in a speech to Congress 
in May of that year, Kennedy said of the mission, "No single space project in 
this period will be more exciting or more impressive to mankind or more 
important for the long-range exploration of space, and none will be so 
difficult or so expensive to accomplish." 


The Apollo 11 mission marked the climax of an unprecedented nine-year effort to 
take man to the moon and back -- and to do it before the Soviet Union did. 
Although the previous Apollo missions had tested many of the technologies used 
in Apollo 11, landing a spacecraft on the moon and bringing it back would be a 
venture into uncharted territory. 


"No one knew what the surface of the moon was like," said Butler, now executive 
director of the McDonnell Douglas space station division in Huntington Beach. 
"We didn't know if Armstrong was going to sink to his knees or what." 




'Feeling of Importance' 


The TRW plant was charged with testing the engines used on the Eagle, the lunar 
module that would take Armstrong and Aldrin from the command module to the 
lunar surface. Those engines would play a critical role, performing as both 
brake and booster for the lunar module, and they had to allow Armstrong and 
Aldrin to change the direction of the module in case they needed to change 
landing sites at the last moment. 


"There was always that feeling of importance," said Benjamin Cruz, a 
33-year-old supervisor on the TRW program in 1969. "We knew we could do it. We 
were pushing the technological edge forward. Our reputation was at stake. I 
don't think there were doubts it could be done, but it was not an easy thing to 
do." 


As it turned out, TRW did its job well. Just as Armstrong and Aldrin were 
preparing to land on the moon, they saw that the intended landing site in the 
Sea of Tranquility was not the clear plain NASA planners had thought. Rather, 
it was a treacherous field covered with boulders the size of automobiles. The 
effort to land would provide some of the most tense moments of the mission. 


The TRW engines performed flawlessly, enabling Armstrong to take manual control 
of the Eagle and steer the spindly looking module into a safer area four miles 
west of the intended site -- and with less than 10 seconds' worth of fuel left. 


"Houston, Tranquility Base here," Armstrong reported back to NASA mission 
control in Houston after the 47-minute descent. "The Eagle has landed." 




Cigars Passed Around 


McDonnell Douglas' Butler was watching at mission control in Houston as the 
Eagle set down on the powdery lunar surface. 


"It was a very tense and exciting time," said Butler, who recalled how he 
became anxious himself as the Eagle's fuel ran low and as Armstrong and Aldrin 
"seemed to take forever" to put on the spacesuits they would wear for the 
moonwalk. 


Those breathless moments turned into sighs of relief and shouts of jubilation 
as Armstrong placed his left boot on the moon's surface, did not sink, and 
uttered the words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for 
mankind." 


"Everyone got out cigars and puffed on them, including me," Butler recalled. "I 
sort of turned green, not being a cigar smoker." 




Goose-Bump Time 


David A. Forge, 55, a test engineer for McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach 
on the Apollo program, recalled watching the moonwalk at home with his wife, 
Delores. 


"I remember sitting there with the biggest goose bumps I've ever had in my life 
and watching the tears running down my wife's cheeks," Forge said. 


"It was an extremely hectic time, and we usually worked around the clock, six 
or seven days a week," said Robert G. Minor, then an engineering manager for 
the Apollo program and now president of Rockwell's space division in Downey. 
"But it was a very high-spirited time because this was a high-visibility 
program with lots of public support." 


The walk itself marked "a great day" for the nation, Minor said. "I look back 
at that as the pinnacle of when the United States was at the top of the 
technological tree. I don't think anybody on Earth compared to us. Obviously, a 
lot has happened since then." 


Despite the attention generated by the mission, Cruz said he and his fellow 
workers were too busy doing their jobs to fully comprehend the significance of 
it all at the time. 




Different Perspective 


"You couldn't stand back and look at it like the nation did," Cruz said. "The 
realization comes after. Then we said, 'My gosh, look what we did.' " 


The lunar lander, after returning Armstrong and Aldrin to the orbiting command 
module piloted by Collins, was discarded, crashing into the moon's surface, 
where it will remain forever. 


Cruz cherishes the thought that he will be able to tell his 3-year-old 
granddaughter that a piece of his work will stay on the moon forever after. 


Although the Apollo program provided exciting and challenging work, its demands 
sometimes took a toll on family life. 


"All of us who worked on the Apollo program went through a lot of conscience 
problems associated with our responsibilities to our families and jobs," said 
Dean, the former Rockwell manager who today is president of a Silicon Valley 
aerospace firm. "We knew that our jobs were going to make the difference 
between the crew surviving a trip to the moon and getting back safely. 


"Maybe that was part of the reason why I hauled my children out to the TV to 
watch the moon landing," Dean said. "I wanted them to understand, in some 
fashion, that my absence had counted for something."

MOON PASSES OILERS TO VICTORY, 24-10; 


AFC: HOUSTON QUARTERBACK BECOMES CLUB'S ALL-TIME LEADING PASSER IN WIN OVER 
COLTS, ECLIPSING HALL OF FAMER GEORGE BLANDA. 




From Associated Press 




HOUSTON 




Quarterback Warren Moon produced a record-setting performance and finally got 
the Houston Oilers' run-and-shoot offense operating efficiently Sunday against 
the Indianapolis Colts. 


After two games filled with mistakes, Moon threw for three touchdowns and 
became the Oilers' all-time leading passer during a 24-10 victory. 


Moon completed 29 of 39 passes for 308 yards and connected on touchdown pass 
plays of 13 and seven yards to Lorenzo White and six yards to Ernest Givins. He 
threw one interception. 


"Really, we needed a win more than I needed to set any kind of records," said 
Moon, a seven-year veteran who now has 19,289 career passing yards, erasing the 
record of 19,149 set by former Oiler quarterback George Blanda. "All this means 
is I've had good receivers and I've been here a long time." 


After both teams spent the first quarter victimizing themselves with mistakes, 
Moon went to White for his touchdowns and a 14-0 halftime lead. 


"We got things going in the second quarter, and that's what we needed," Oiler 
Coach Jack Pardee said. 


The Oilers (1-2) took advantage of four first-half turnovers by the Colts 
(0-3), including fumbles by Jack Trudeau and Clarence Verdin and interceptions 
of passes thrown by Jeff George and Trudeau. 


"We had our chances, and we constantly stopped ourselves," Colt Coach Ron Meyer 
said. 


Trudeau replaced George in the second quarter when George was bothered by a 
stomach ailment. 


But Meyer had to send George back into the game in the final minutes after 
Trudeau and Mark Herrmann were injured. 


The CBS-TV affiliate in Indianapolis reported Meyer and offensive coordinator 
Larry Kennan might be fired, but Colt General Manager Jim Irsay called the 
report erroneous.

RANDY LEWIS: WOODSTOCK PROMOTERS SHOOT THE MOON AND WIN; 


BUT 1969'S OTHER GREAT SHOW, MAN'S FIRST LUNAR LANDING, IS LAGGING A BIT ON THE 
NOSTALGIA CIRCUIT 




By Randy Lewis 




Is it just coincidence that more attention has been devoted this summer to the 
20th anniversary of Woodstock -- that back-yard-barbecue and rock 'n' roll 
party for 400,000 -- than to the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the 
moon? 


Not at all, and any number of explanations loom. 


One is that there were so many eyewitnesses on Max Yasgur's farm back in August 
of 1969 that there's no dismissing Woodstock as a hoax, foisted on the world 
out of a Hollywood movie set. (The only proof brought back by those guys who 
said they went to the moon was a couple of buckets of rocks.) 


Another possibility is that Woodstock struck a deeper emotional chord with an 
entire generation (especially if you count everyone who saw the movie) than the 
sight of a couple of guys on TV hopping around the lunar surface. Jeez, we'd 
seen that years before on "Lost in Space." 


You might even consider that Woodstock is getting so much better play on TV, in 
newspapers and magazines because there's a wider variety of vintage photos 
available than for the landing on the moon. What with a half-dozen moon shots 
in all, one mission looks pretty much like the next, right? 


The real reason, I'd submit, is far more tangible. Woodstock has been doing 
stronger box-office on the nostalgia circuit because nobody gave enough thought 
to making a buck off Apollo 11. 


Think about it. Have you seen Neil Armstrong posters and T-shirts flooding 
finer department stores everywhere? Record companies issuing the flight tapes 
on triple compact-disc sets (with new liner notes by Carl Sagan)? Movie 
companies re-releasing the historic film footage to theaters and pay-per-view 
cable networks nationwide (in Lucasfilm THX stereo)? Bumper stickers with a 
photo of the moon, the NASA logo and the slogan "We did it OUR way"? 


If they had any real smarts, the feds could be selling off most of those stones 
Neil and the boys brought back from Tranquility Base as 20-year-old 
commemoratives. They could net enough to finance a manned shot to Mars. 


Let's face it -- NASA blew it. They had a hot property -- one of the monumental 
scientific explorations in history, certainly the biggest to be preserved so 
exhaustively on film, magnetic tape and computer memory -- and what did they do 
with the bulk of it? Handed it over to public television. 


Not the folks connected with Woodstock. To them, the sky's the limit. Heck, the 
hordes of individuals and corporations holding any ties whatsoever to those 
"three days of peace, love and music" not only made headlines for all the ways 
they dreamed up to cash in 20 years later, but generated even more news with 
fights over all the alleged copyright infringements. 


Warner Bros., which had copyrighted the name of "Woodstock," sued a bunch of 
'60s rockers -- including some of those who turned the festival into a 
marketable commodity in the first place -- to stop them from using the name in 
connection with a commemorative concert they wanted to stage. 


Of course, lacking rights to the Woodstock name hasn't prevented capitalizing 
-- with a capital CAPITAL -- on the Woodstock memory. This weekend, the "20 
Years After Music &amp; Art Festival" at Cal State Dominguez Hills is bringing 
together such Woodstock hall-of-famers as Canned Heat (minus Bob (Bear) Hite 
and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson -- deceased), Electric Flag (minus Mike Bloomfield 
-- deceased), Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company (minus Janis Joplin -- 
deceased) and the Band of Gypsies (minus Jimi Hendrix -- deceased). 


Curious that the 20 Years After fest didn't or couldn't book 10 Years After. Is 
it because leader Alvin Lee is still alive, or because by now they'd be 30 
Years After and it'd just be too darn confusing? 


Fittingly, the whole enterprise is being sponsored by KLSX-FM, the Los Angeles 
radio station that owes its existence to dredging up hourly the Ghosts of Rock 
'n' Roll Past. Besides the retro music, there will be an "art and crafts bazaar 
featuring tie-dye shirts, hand-tooled leather and beaded goods, candles, 
pottery, musical instruments, body painting and much more activity reminiscent 
of the '60s." All the quaint accouterments. 


There's even a "psychedelic car and hippie van competition." Beginning to feel 
like Charlie Brown at Christmas, when he comes upon Snoopy decorating his dog 
house to "win, win win -- money, money, money"? 


If the real Woodstock had been born of this attitude, it wouldn't have featured 
Hendrix, Joplin, the Who and others at the forefront of popular music. It would 
have been an ode to the great music, cars and clothes of 1949. 


It's too bad Jackie Gleason isn't still around to put this all in the proper 
perspective. Wouldn't you just love to see Ralph Kramden getting more and more 
fed up with all the genuflecting over the anniversary of Woodstock, turning 
from his dinner plate and growling: 


 One a these days, Alice -- to da moon!

S. KOREA DISSIDENT'S SURPRISE TRIP TO NORTH STIRS FUROR 




By KARL SCHOENBERGER, Times Staff Writer 




SEOUL 




The unauthorized visit of a South Korean dissident leader to Pyongyang, the 
capital of Communist North Korea, has sparked an uproar here and threatens to 
destabilize an already tense political situation. 


The Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, 71, shocked officials in Seoul by appearing in Pyongyang 
over the weekend after making a clandestine journey via Tokyo and Beijing. By 
Monday, news of his bold, free-lance attempt to promote the cause of Korean 
reunification had aroused the indignation of the media and the disapproval of 
opposition parties. 


Government authorities were irate and vowed to arrest Moon on his return for 
violating the National Security Law, which bans unauthorized contacts with the 
North Korean enemy. The reaction was in sharp contrast to the exuberant mood 
that greeted a trip to North Korea in January by Chung Ju Yung, founder of the 
Hyundai conglomerate, who undertook a private trade mission with the blessings 
of the government. 


Moon's gambit came on the heels of a controversial decision by President Roh 
Tae Woo to cancel an anticipated midterm referendum on his first year in 
office, ostensibly because he and his mainstream political opponents agreed 
that the vote might cause social unrest and provoke a confrontation between the 
radical left and the extreme right. 


Roh recently has been beset by hard-liners in the military and in the ruling 
circles who are expressing displeasure over the president's relatively tolerant 
approach to unfettered -- and unfamiliar -- democratic dissent. 


Roh canceled the referendum March 20 with a pledge to get tough on the "violent 
leftist fringe" that he warned was attempting to overthrow the government. 


Moon's challenge to the government's rigid control over contacts with North 
Korea appears to have generated enough confusion to provide Roh with a broad 
pretext to crack down on dissent for national security reasons. 


"Whatever (Moon's) motive for his unauthorized trip, either from romantic 
nationalism or idealism, it can only be damaging," declared an editorial in 
today's edition of the Korea Herald, a state-owned daily. "His impractical 
attempt will only play into the deceptive and masterful stratagem of North 
Korea." 


Much to the consternation of authorities here, Moon addressed North Korean 
President Kim Il Sung as "respectable chairman" and made a passing reference to 
"dictatorial forces" in South Korea in his arrival remarks Saturday. The 
remarks were reported in a dispatch by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News 
Agency. 


The Presbyterian minister attended an Easter service at a Pyongyang church 
Sunday, and he reportedly described a vision of Korean reunification as the 
"resurrection of the nation." 


Moon, a veteran dissident and former political prisoner who was educated at 
Princeton University, had been invited to Pyongyang, along with two other 
dissident leaders and the heads of South Korea's four political parties, by Kim 
Il Sung in the North Korean leader's most recent New Year's address. 


Minister for Unification Lee Hong Koo told reporters Monday that Moon's trip 
would only serve to strengthen the North Korean position in 
government-to-government negotiations. Talks on fielding a joint sports team in 
the 1990 Asian Games are set to resume today at Panmunjom, the peace village in 
the demilitarized zone. A third session aimed at arranging prime 
ministerial-level political dialogue is scheduled for April 12. 


"Rev. Moon's personal visit is feared to hamper our sincere efforts to have 
closer dialogue with the north, adding confusion to official talks," Lee said. 


Opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, speaking to diplomats and reporters at the 
Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club on Monday, said Moon's visit should be seen 
in the context of Roh's own policy of north-south reconciliation, which the 
president unveiled, with much fanfare, last July. 


"He declared that North Korea is our partner, not our enemy, and we should 
regard them as such. In this spirit, the exchange of people of all walks of 
life would be helpful to ease tension," Kim said. "I do believe, however, that 
it might have been much better if Rev. Moon consulted with the government 
before he went." 


Local press reports suggested the government was particularly miffed that its 
intelligence apparatus, which has a reputation for formidable efficiency, 
failed to detect Moon's plans to go to Pyongyang. The Korea Herald quoted an 
unidentified government source as saying authorities were studying plans to 
increase surveillance. Roh had promised to curtail spying on South Korean 
citizens as part of his democratic reforms.

MOON NEEDED ONLY ONE SECOND CHANCE 




By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




HOUSTON 




The boy stood handcuffed near the checkout counter, held by a security guard 
and watched carefully by the store manager. 


The entire future of 14-year-old Warren Moon revolved around a stolen 99-cent 
headband. 


Or so he felt at the time. 


"It was the most embarrassing moment of my life," the Houston Oilers 
quarterback said. "I was standing in the middle of the store and everyone had a 
chance to see me. I felt as low as I could possibly feel. 


"Then my mom came to pick me up and the look in her eyes, I could see the hurt 
and I knew I'd really screwed up and hurt her bad." 


Moon went into the store with two friends to buy ice cream and as they wandered 
through the aisles Moon's companions each grabbed a headband and stuffed it in 
their pants. 


"Being along and being stupid, I did the same thing," Moon said. 


Moon got his ice cream and a candy bar and went to the front of the store. But 
a loudspeaker alerted the security guard to "stop those three boys at the 
counter." The other two boys ran. Moon was sacked and searched. 


"They searched me and found the headband," Moon said. "I had $3 in my pocket 
and could have paid for it." 


In his worst moment, Moon got a break. 


"The store manager thought he'd taught me a lesson and didn't press charges," 
Moon said. "He gave me a second chance and my Mom stressed that I was getting a 
second chance and not to blow it. From that day forward, I never did anything 
like that again." 


Moon has made the most of his second chances since that day at the neighborhood 
store. 


He's also given plenty of second chances through his Cresent Moon charitable 
foundation, helping steer others away from the temptations of the streets. 


"I've had to kind of take that extra step at every level just to show what I 
can do whether it be junior college or Canada before I got a chance to play in 
the NFL," Moon said. 


Second chances. 


Moon was an all-city performer at Los Angeles Hamilton High and attended West 
Los Angeles Junior College to get a second chance to play big time college 
football at the University of Washington, where he was the 1978 most valuable 
player in the Rose Bowl and PAC-8 player of the year. 


He played six seasons in the Canadian Football League after college before he 
got a second chance to play for the Houston Oilers, where this season he became 
the only pro quarterback to pass for 20,000 yards in both the Canadian Football 
League and the NFL. 


"I've been told all my life that I couldn't play this position, that I didn't 
have what it took," Moon said. "There were people on the other side saying that 
I could but it was the people who told me I couldn't that kept me going. I have 
a lot of confidence in myself." 


Part of Moon's lack of acceptance as a quarterback centered around being black. 
Moon is proud of the part he's played, along with Philadelphia's Randall 
Cunningham and former Washington quarterback Doug Williams, in clearing the way 
for future NFL black quarterbacks. 


Right now, Moon rates among the best of all NFL quarterbacks. He is second in 
the AFC and fifth overall with an 89.3 rating. Although he has been intercepted 
11 times -- only Boomer Esiason has thrown more among conference passers -- he 
also has thrown for 19 touchdowns, second only to Joe Montana. And his 2,830 
yards trails only Montana. 


Moon became a close friend last year with Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, now 
a rookie with the Detroit Lions. He rented a freeway billboard to congratulate 
the University of Houston star on his award. 


"Doug's achievements helped more than anybody else's because he got to the 
highest point of the pedestal," Moon said. "That put him in a class with the 
great ones and turned a lot of heads as far as some of the stereotypes and 
stigmas that were placed on black quarterbacks." 


The only stereotype Oilers offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride sees in Moon is 
that he is the perfect stereotype of a run-and-shoot quarterback. 


"You pretty much describe Warren when you talk about the qualities you look for 
in a run-and-shoot quarterback," Gilbride said. "He's done a great job of 
putting us where we need to be. All we need are a few more Ws." 


The focus in the run-and-shoot is the quarterback, Gilbride said. 


"If you run an I-formation, you'd better have a great tailback otherwise you're 
kidding yourself," Gilbride said. "If you're in the run-and-shoot, it's 
critical that the guy playing quarterback is of the same vintage. 


"If you ask him to throw 40 to 60 passes a game and he's not performing very 
well, you don't have much offense." 


Wide receiver Ernest Givins is convinced Moon is the man and the run-and-shoot 
is the offense to lead the Oilers to the Super Bowl. 


"You couldn't ask for an better offense that fits the style of Warren," Givins 
said. "He rolls out better than anybody, he throws on the move better than 
anybody I've ever seen or throws back across the field. It just fits him." 


Moon is one of the wealthiest players in the game, he's at the top of his 
profession with the respect of his peers. All that remains is "the big one," 
getting to the Super Bowl. 


"I never look at it in terms that I'll never do it," Moon said. "It's something 
I want and it's something that burns inside me." 


He also realizes that at 33 he may be running out of second chances. 


"I don't have a lot of time left to do it, maybe two or three more years," Moon 
said. "This team is at the stage where in the next two years there's going to 
be major changes and start the wheel all over. I don't have time to go through 
a rebuilding situation." 


Whether Moon reaches the Super Bowl or not, he's already a hero to both young 
and old through his Cresent Moon Foundation. He was named the NFL Man of the 
Year for 1990 because of the varied programs his organization funds. 


Moon has special motivation for helping. He grew up with six sisters, a mother 
and no father. 


"I wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for some of the organizations 
that I was involved with as a kid," Moon said. "It's not just the organizations 
but the people who took the time because they realized I didn't have a Dad 
around the house." 


Moon was seven when his father died needing a liver transplant that never came. 


"I had a strong mom who played both roles but I also had a lot of those people 
around that kept me focused," Moon said. 


Moon's support group includes a kindly store manager who must now wish he'd 
gotten an autograph on the contraband headband.

3RD MOON FOUND ORBITING NEPTUNE 




By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 




A new moon of Neptune, about one-fifth the size of Earth's moon, has been 
discovered in photographs taken by the Voyager 2 space probe, Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory researchers said today. Only two moons, Nereid and Triton, were 
previously known. 


The new moon, temporarily designated 1989 N1, is as large as 400 miles in 
diameter and orbits Neptune's equator at an altitude of about 57,000 miles. It 
was discovered by JPL astronomer Stephen P. Synnott as a "small, bright smudge" 
on photographs of the giant blue-green planet. The photographs were taken from 
57 million miles away as the probe raced toward its Aug. 24 rendezvous with 
Neptune and Triton. 


Subsequent photographs showed the moon in different positions corresponding to 
the predicted orbit, confirming that the object is a moon. 


Earlier photographs from Voyager had revealed the existence of a large "dark 
spot" on Neptune similar to the giant red spot on Jupiter and believed to be 
caused by weather conditions. The photographs have also revealed dark bands 
near the poles similar to those seen on other gaseous planets. 


The new moon, which is too faint to appear in printed photographs, is the first 
of as many as 10 that researchers expect to find circling Neptune.

14 AT HOME; 


SAY IT WITH A BALLOON 




By Joan Draper 




PLANNING TO PROPOSE to your sweetheart but don't know how to do it? A 15-foot 
red heart stationed outside her home is sure to score a yes. And when the big 
day of the nuptials finally arrives, Adams Balloon Advertising can drape a 
banner over a giant inflatable, replete with personal message and internal 
lighting. 


In this city of air kisses and overblown egos, there is now a way to send 
appropriately grandiose holiday and personal messages: with a custom inflated 
balloon that lights up with your special salutation. Adams will set up a 
33x30-foot birthday cake inflatable (for $450) on your father's front lawn 
decorated with a personal message (24x20-foot is $350, 11x9-foot is $150). Or, 
depending on your relationship and the intended greeting, maybe a 22-foot-high 
gorilla ($350) -- or a 25-foot-high clown ($350; 18 feet, $250) -- would best 
do the trick. And when Halloween rolls around this fall, there are giant 
jack-o'-lanterns and friendly ghosts, and for Christmas, robust Santas and 
snowmen and such.

ALDRIN SAYS U.S. SPACE POLICY ADRIFT; 


'69 MOON-WALKER WANTS TO SEE A FEW MORE GIANT LEAPS 




By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 




Twenty years. A blink of time in the universe but a fourth of a lifetime for 
most mortals. 


Buzz Aldrin, 59, sits at a desk in his Laguna Beach home, windows opening on a 
stunning view of the Emerald Bay coast of the Pacific Ocean. To his right, a 
wall of pictures and artwork document his career as an Air Force officer and 
astronaut. 


"July 16 will be the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch," Aldrin said. 
"I'll be there, at the Cape, at the exact time of liftoff, to mark that 
anniversary." 


Four days later, Aldrin will be in Washington. In the company of Neil Armstrong 
and Michael Collins, Aldrin will stand with President Bush at the Smithsonian 
Institution. Along with the rest of the world, they will recall the great 
adventure: the day Armstrong became the first man to step on the moon, and 
Aldrin, 18 minutes later, the second, while Collins soared in lunar orbit above 
them. 


Twenty years after the moonwalk, Aldrin is clear-eyed, robust, physically fit. 
But he is clearly an angry man -- an explorer who is enraged at his country for 
failing to advance beyond the moon. Indeed, he is angry that the United States 
seems to have abandoned the moon itself. 


"America won the first moon race," Aldrin wrote in his new book, "Men from 
Earth." "But it is possible we will become a second-rate space power in the 
next century." 


In an interview, Aldrin repeatedly hit on the theme of America's squandering of 
the potential of the moon. It can serve as the U.S. launching pad to Mars, he 
said. The moon can provide "an ample supply of the isotope helium-3" to fuel 
nuclear fusion reactors that "would be almost completely devoid of 
radioactivity," he said. 


The moon, Aldrin said, could also be used to collect solar energy and beam it 
earthward -- a cheap, renewable source of power. 


Aldrin's blue eyes flash. He jabs a finger at the interviewer. 


"We went six years without even flying one American into orbit, while the 
Soviets continued to perfect Soyuz I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and then (the 
space station) Mir," Aldrin said. "And we still haven't put an operating 
location in space." 


There is already a great, logical place for the United States to build a 
permanent, human-staffed space station, he said. "It's called the moon." 


America needs a thriving, active base on the moon, he said. "Initially, we need 
to build up, to set out, the facilities that then can serve man (on Earth) with 
lunar resources," Aldrin said. "We need information from telescopes to be 
placed on the far side of the moon. We need transmission bases and manned 
scientific investigations just like when they put people in Antarctica. We 
don't just put machines in Antarctica to send back lots of information. We put 
people down there." 


When Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin blasted off from Cape Kennedy (now Cape 
Canaveral) in Florida, Aldrin was generally described as the threesome's most 
accomplished scientist. An intense, driven man, he speaks tersely, using few 
adjectives. When he stepped onto the moon's surface 20 years ago, however, he 
was moved to say: "Beautiful! beautiful! Magnificent desolation." Later, Aldrin 
unfurled an American flag, planted the staff into the tough lunar surface and 
then gave the Stars and Stripes a snappy West Point salute. An estimated 500 
million people around the world watched television coverage of the historic 
moment. 


In his book, Aldrin said his most nervous moments came during the flag 
ceremony. "I suddenly felt stage fright," he wrote. "Since childhood, I'd been 
fascinated by explorers planting flags on strange shores. Now I was about to do 
the same thing, but on the most exotic shore mankind had ever reached." 


Before stepping onto the lunar surface, Aldrin performed a private religious 
ceremony inside the module. Using a small Communion kit given him by his 
Presbyterian pastor, Aldrin conducted a remembrance of Christ's Last Supper. "I 
gave thanks," Aldrin wrote in his book. 


Life has brought hard landings for the former astronaut since his historic 
moonwalk. Aldrin, who bought a condominium and moved to Orange County about 5 
1/2 years ago, had divorced twice before he met and married Lois Driggs Aldrin 
and moved to her Emerald Bay home. He has battled depression and overcome an 
addiction to alcohol. Aldrin has also encountered career frustration. Instead 
of another space job after Apollo 11, Aldrin was assigned to command the test 
flight school at Edwards Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles. 


"I went back to the Air Force and tried to find a home there," Aldrin said. "It 
was a challenging assignment, but inappropriate really for me to command a test 
pilot school. I'd never had any formal training in test piloting. Also, I'd 
been away from the military 11 years -- 3 1/2 years while getting my doctor's 
degree at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and 7 1/2 years at NASA 
(National Aeronautics and Space Administration). A much better assignment would 
have been at the Air Force Academy, as commandant of cadets. But they (in the 
Air Force) had other ideas in mind." 


Aldrin was born in Montclair, N.J., and christened Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. He 
legally changed his name to Buzz, his lifelong nickname, about 10 years ago. 
The nickname was his older sister's fuzzy way of calling him "baby brother." 


He graduated in 1951 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, third in his 
class. Aldrin was a fighter pilot during the Korean War and credited with 
shooting down two MIG-15 jets. After earning his doctorate from MIT, for which 
he wrote on orbital rendezvous techniques in space, he was tapped for the 
astronaut program in 1963. 


Despite his long years in the military, Aldrin now speaks acidly of the Air 
Force. "I've seen that the Air Force really doesn't know how to treat space 
people," he said. "They don't look after their promotions, their livelihood, 
anywhere near the way the Navy does." 


He retired with the rank of colonel in March, 1972. By then, Aldrin was 
experiencing periods of depression, which he candidly discussed in his first 
book, "Return to Earth." 


Now, years later, as he sits at his home in Laguna Beach, Aldrin says 
alcoholism was at the root of the depression. 


"The last person to be aware of the seriousness and progression of the disease 
of alcoholism is the person who's got it," Aldrin said. "So I was unable to 
really come to grips (with) what was troubling me at the time. And it was not 
depression or anxiety or nervousness. It was inherited, genetic traits (toward 
alcoholism) that I just fostered and encouraged, and thank God, the trauma of 
being put on a pedestal, and trying to live up to that, accelerated the 
progression (of the disease) so that I had a chance, before I was too old, to 
go through a recovery process. So all of that brought about this kind of 
turnaround and forced me to make that kind of recovery in '75 and '76. I had 
three years of stumbling around, but now it's 10 1/2 years" of continuous 
sobriety. 


"Let me tell it more simply," his wife, Lois, said. "What would you do at the 
age of 40, if you'd worked for this fantastic career where you reached the top? 
You'd want to go on! But what if you found suddenly that you couldn't go on in 
that career -- that your progress and your ideas in life were stopped? So who 
wouldn't get depressed?" 


America has made poor use of its former astronauts, Aldrin said. "I don't think 
we've done very well as far as establishing a rapport between all former 
astronauts on an annual basis," he said. "We haven't got a unity. We're taken 
advantage of because of that. We've played one against the other. We don't get 
the privileges that I think our status deserves, and it's because we're not 
unified. 


"You know, I really know an awful lot about what we ought to do in the future 
in space," he said. "But I'm not consulted when decisions are made. I think I 
should be." 


Aldrin's permanent status as the second man to walk on the moon has led to 
endless interview questions and a suggestion in his book that he was 
dissatisfied with the decision. But Aldrin pointed out in the interview that 
Armstrong was both commander of the lunar expedition and had seniority because 
he was picked earlier for training as an astronaut. 


"I'd have a hard time explaining why the junior member of the third group (of 
astronauts), the co-pilot, was given the privilege of saying the historic words 
of first putting his foot on the moon and then looking back and seeing my 
commander in the lunar module waiting his turn to come down to the surface," 
Aldrin said. 


He said he is not bitter. "Why should I be? But how do I deny being bitter 
about it? How the hell can you answer that one except by saying, 'Listen, 
honestly, I'm a military man, I understand seniority.' " 


Aldrin, an international space consultant and lecturer since his military 
retirement, is now finding life good. He likes living in Orange County because 
"it's got growth and tremendous opportunity." He also enjoys being near the 
tranquility of the ocean. 


His three grown children -- a daughter and two sons -- visit frequently.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] MITI has moved toward the realization of the "Lunar 
Resource Development Project" (provisional name), which is an 
effort to get helium-3, a nuclear fusion fuel, from the surface 
of the moon and bring it back to earth. The project involves 
setting up a government-private research cooperative in FY95, 
then, when the 21st century begins, to begin actual resource 
probing of the moon's surface. To prepare for the establishment 
of the research cooperative, the "Forum on Lunar Resources" will 
begin this month. Helium-3, which gives off hardly any 
radioactivity, is said to be the ideal fuel for nuclear fusion. 
Succeeding in putting helium-3 into practical use could solve 
the world's resource problems for the next several centuries. 
MITI has also asked NASA, a U.S. organization that has shown 
results in space development, and other groups to join in the 
project. The idea is for the project to evolve into the first 
international space development project led by Japan. 
  In addition to the AIST Geological Survey of Japan and the 
AIST National Institute for Resources and Environment, about 20 
companies, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nissan Motors, 
and Hitachi, Ltd., will participate in the "Forum on Lunar 
Resources." The forum will investigate important development 
topics such as 1) how to separate and remove helium-3 from moon 
sand, 2) technology for transporting the helium-3 from the moon 
to the earth, 3) the development of lunar base camps and lunar 
vehicles, and 4) problems over rights of possession in the case 
where base camps are set up. 
  The government-private research cooperative will begin 
research on the critical technologies in FY95, and will launch a 
probe rocket to the moon when the 21st century begins. The goal 
is to realize a lunar resource gathering system that will convey 
helium-3 from the lunar base camps to earth in the 2020s. 
  Nuclear fusion using helium-3 as fuel is seen as a promising 
source of energy that has markedly less radioactivity than 
conventional reactions using tritium as a fuel. 
  Trial calculations show that burning several tens of tons 
per 
year of helium-3 in nuclear fusion would furnish enough 
electrical power for the entire world in the 21st century. 
Although there is no helium-3 on earth, millions of tons of it 
are presumed to be on the moon's surface. 
  There are also funding and technical issues, such as the 
enormous development costs and making fusion reactors practical. 
MITI, however, says that if the concept is realized there are 
high possibilities that it will solve energy and environmental 
problems and that it will lead to the uncovering of a tremendous 
space business. 
  Helium-3 
  Helium-3 exists in collections of high-energy particles that 
are carried away from the sun (the solar wind). Because the 
solar wind falls directly on the moon's surface, where there is 
no air, helium-3 is said to be abundant in the moon's sand and 
rocks. Even when helium-3 undergoes nuclear fusion with tritium, 
most of the energy is taken out in the form of protons. 
Therefore, there is little effect due to radioactivity on the 
surroundings.

APOLLO FLIGHTS SEND PRODUCER ON A MISSION; 


MOVIES: AL REINERT USES FOOTAGE FROM NINE APOLLO MOON VOYAGES TO CREATE 'FOR 
ALL MANKIND.' 




By SEAN MITCHELL 




Ten years ago, Texas magazine writer Al Reinert made a trip to the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston to research an article commemorating the 10th 
anniversary of man's landing on the moon. Until then, he had not followed 
America's space program with unusual interest and certainly could not have 
foreseen that his sojourn inside the vaults of the NASA archives would 
eventually uproot him from his familiar free-lance writer's desk and hurl him 
into the quixotic role of independent film maker. 


But that is what happened, as is now evident from the release of Reinert's 
decade-in-the-making documentary about the moon missions, "For All Mankind," 
now playing a limited engagement at the Cinerama Dome, Crest in Westwood, and 
other selected theaters. 


The feature-length film he made is a brand of poetic nonfiction. The voices of 
13 astronauts narrate a composite voyage to the moon, assembled from rarely 
seen NASA footage taken during the nine manned Apollo flights and underscored 
by the quietly ethereal guitar lines of art rock composer Brian Eno. 


Like fellow journalist Michael Moore, who made the recent movie "Roger &amp; 
Me," Reinert had no previous experience in motion pictures when he began his 
film odyssey in 1979. Initially, he was armed only with $30,000 raised from 
friends and the knowledge that most of the film shot by NASA during the 
historic Apollo missions was technically in the public domain. The biggest 
problem was, there were 2,000 hours of it. 


"Anybody can walk into the NASA film archives and do film research," Reinert 
said during a visit to Los Angeles, where the film opens today. "I was just the 
first fool who said, 'I want to see all of it.' " 


Reinert moved to Houston, where for two years he sat down almost every day with 
a NASA film librarian to look at film of the Apollo flights. Eventually, he 
logged more time there than all three television networks combined. 


"It was the first time I had an awareness of it as film instead of just boring 
TV stuff. I thought, 'Why has this never been on a big screen?' It was my naive 
writer's reaction to it. I mean, I wasn't a film maker, but I thought, this is 
a movie that I would like to see." 


He had arrived at a good time. The Apollo program was finished and the first 
space shuttle launch was still a few years away. "All these people at NASA had 
nothing better to do than sit around and tell you their stories. That's when I 
met the first astronauts I'd ever met. Most of them were retired even then, and 
so they no longer had NASA looking over their shoulders. And as individuals 
they had had time for the experience to have settled and percolated a bit." 


Reinert talked to all 24 men who had flown to the moon and recorded 80 hours of 
interviews with 20 of them. The interviews revealed something surprising that 
would shape the movie: the experience the astronauts remembered most vividly 
was not going to the moon but leaving the Earth. 


"Apollo had always been portrayed as going to the moon. It never occurred to me 
that that's really secondary," Reinert said. "The moon's just the first place 
you can stop. But what was really meaningful to these guys, if you talk to 
them, what sticks in their minds was leaving the Earth . . . because for days 
they watched the Earth shrink! 


"What I heard from all these men was the story of a spiritual journey, much 
more than a technical achievement." 


Reinert made the decision early on to "scramble all the missions together," in 
order to create a single representative trip in the narrative. He said the 
astronauts themselves encouraged him to do this. 


"My attitude is that it's historical trivia that there were nine different 
missions. Most people aren't even aware of that after only 20 years. The story 
we tried to tell from the beginning was a subjective story -- what was it like 
to leave Earth? It's not about the space program, it's not about NASA." 


NASA is not even mentioned in the film. 


"What we were trying to do from Day One was make the movie that people would 
watch in 500 years when they want to know about this. Had there been a camera 
crew with Columbus, we'd still watch that movie and that was 500 years ago." 


Each of the Apollo missions carried at least three movie cameras aboard for the 
astronauts to use, as well as cameras mounted inside the stages of the rocket 
to capture close-up pictures of a separation 70 miles above the Earth. 


"For All Mankind" also includes such exotica as platform-level footage of a 
blast-off taken by a camera that was melted in the process and startling 
moonscapes of astronauts hopping up and down in song like boys on a playground. 


These are images most Americans have never seen before, but such originality 
was not enough to get the movie made or distributed in less than 10 years. 
Reinert, 42, used up his initial investment to make a 10-minute sample to show 
investors, but it wasn't long before he was back looking for magazine 
assignments to pay his bills. 


"We showed that 10 minutes to whoever would look at it and raised the next 
bunch of money, about $75,000, and went back to work," he said. "That's been 
the history of the whole project." 


Eventually, a limited partnership was put together and $600,000 was raised. In 
all, Reinert and co-producer Betsy Broyles Breier tapped 40 Texas investors to 
cover the film's $1.5 million budget. 


"We were not great fund-raisers," Reinert said. "It took us two years to sell 
17 partnership units of $33,000 each. We're not talking Donald Trump here." 


But Reinert, a bearish, garrulous Texan, was not without the gift of 
persuasion. Back in 1983, when he was still editing parts of the rough cut in 
his Houston living room and listening to assorted records in search of a 
suitable sound track, he sent off a six-page letter to Brian Eno asking for his 
help. 


Two months later Eno booked six weeks of studio time with his own money to 
score the film. "He hasn't been paid anything yet," the director said. 


"For All Mankind" was finished a year ago and shown for the first time at the 
U.S. Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where it won the grand jury prize for 
best documentary. It has gone on to showings at festivals in Tokyo, Munich, 
Montreal, Toronto and last week Palm Springs, earning support along the way 
from George Lucas, Robert Redford and the Sierra Club, Earthwatch and other 
environmental groups. 


But it has not found a Hollywood distributor. 


In November, Reinert and executive producer Fred Miller decided to go directly 
to theater owners, essentially booking the film themselves into five theaters 
in San Francisco and Seattle "to see if we were right or not, or if we were 
complete fools." 


The film did more than $200,000 worth of business in four weeks, which led to 
later bookings in Los Angeles, Texas and, next month, the East Coast. 


"Off and on I think the most I ever got paid was $600 a week," Reinert recalled 
of his decade-long film labors. "And I got that sporadically. But mostly I paid 
the bills as a magazine writer. I had a lot more money 10 years ago than I have 
now."

1ST MAN ON MOON BACKS PLANNED SPACE STATION 




From United Press International 




WASHINGTON 




Neil A. Armstrong, who walked into history 20 years ago July as the first man 
on the moon, made a rare public appearance today with his two Apollo 11 crew 
mates and endorsed NASA's planned space station. 


At a news conference to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their historic 
flight, Armstrong, 58, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin, 59, and Michael Collins, 58, 
reminisced about their July 16, 1969, blastoff atop a mighty Saturn 5 rocket 
and the mission that fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's promise to land men 
on the moon before the end of the 1960s. 


"Ten years ago, I did make a statement endorsing the concept of a permanent 
presence in space," Armstrong said. "I guess I still feel that's a worthy 
objective. I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality before we have 
another 10 years go by." 


Armstrong was referring to NASA's plans to build a permanently manned space 
station in the late 1990s, a project that is threatened by budget cuts and a 
lack of political support. 




Mars Mission Endorsed 


Aldrin called for an evolutionary approach to exploring the solar system while 
Collins strongly endorsed a mission to Mars. 


"I think this country should set a goal of exploring and setting up on Mars," 
Collins said. "That is the one goal that . . . I think would have a unifying 
and perhaps even an electrifying effect on NASA and our space program." 


Armstrong and Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969, 
in a spider-like lunar module spacecraft called Eagle while Collins orbited 69 
miles overhead in the gumdrop-shaped Apollo command module, Columbia. 


"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong said as 
he stepped onto the moon's surface. 


While Aldrin and Collins have granted interviews and written books, Armstrong, 
a very private man, has routinely refused to meet the press or make public 
appearances.

CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 


14 AT HOME; 


SAY IT WITH A BALLOON 




By Joan draper Adams Balloon Advertising, 701 Redlen Ave., Whittier; (818) 
968-4243. 




PLANNING TO PROPOSE to your sweetheart but don't know how to do it? A 15-foot 
red heart stationed outside her home is sure to score a yes. And when the big 
day of the nuptials finally arrives, Adams Balloon Advertising can drape a 
banner over a giant inflatable, replete with personal message and internal 
lighting. 


In this city of air kisses and overblown egos, there is now a way to send 
appropriately grandiose holiday and personal messages: with a custom inflated 
balloon that lights up with your special salutation. Adams will set up a 
33x30-foot birthday cake inflatable (for $450) on your father's front lawn 
decorated with a personal message (24x20-foot is $350, 11x9-foot is $150). Or, 
depending on your relationship and the intended greeting, maybe a 22-foot-high 
gorilla ($350) -- or a 25-foot-high clown ($350; 18 feet, $250) -- would best 
do the trick. And when Halloween rolls around this fall, there are giant 
jack-o'-lanterns and friendly ghosts, and for Christmas, robust Santas and 
snowmen and such. Joan draper Adams Balloon Advertising, 701 Redlen Ave.,
