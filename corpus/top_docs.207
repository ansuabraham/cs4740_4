<TEXT>     2. Anna homma-duh homma-du-du-du hommaaaaaaaaa.;    3.
Dee-uh-dee-hah-hah-hah buh-huheee-buh-huhe-eee-eee-eee-ray-have.;    You say
you don't recognize it? Nonsense. Of course you do. It's likely that you've
heard and sung it dozens or hundreds of times, depending on your age. Your
parents sang it. And probably your grandparents too.;    You still don't know
it? I'll throw out a few hints.;    It's a very old song. The words were
written more than 150 years ago. The melody is even older than that. You still
don't know? Then you don't go to many Opening Days at baseball games.;    Of
course, when Francis Scott Key wrote that line, as well as the others that
precede and follow it, he kept the lyrics much simpler: "O'er the land of the
free and the home of the brave." And for many years, that's the way it was
sung.;    But it's no longer done that way. There has developed an informal
competition among singers at ballparks, hockey rinks, basketball stadiums and
other patriotic gathering places to see who can best turn "The Star-Spangled
Banner" into something resembling the howls of a maniac.;    I'm not sure when
these free-form interpretations began, although I vaguely remember some guy
named Jose creating a stir a few years ago by opening a World Series with a
rendition that sounded like the Star-Spangled Cha-Cha-Cha.;    Since then, I
have heard the anthem has been performed as the Star-Spangled Rock, the
Star-Spangled Disco, the Star-Spangled Gospel, the Star-Spangled Blues, the
Star-Spangled Hootenanny and the Star-Spangled Barbershop Quartet.;    A few
weeks ago, a woman who sang it before a Chicago Bulls game is believed to have
set a record by using a variety of prolonged howls, shrieks, warbles, screams
and other vocal acrobatics to drag it out to more than five minutes.;    A man
who was there told me: "I couldn't understand one word. And, I swear, if I
were a Chicago policeman and I heard those sounds coming from a building, I
would radio for backup, then draw my gun and go crashing into the place on the
assumption that a woman was being brutally attacked by a gang of fiends.";   
I think it is time to draw the line. After all, it is our national anthem. As
such, it should be performed with some dignity, rather than sounding as if the
singer has been bitten in the rear by a pit bull.;    It's doubtful that
anyone would stand in center court at Wimbledon and sing: "Ga-hah
Say-hey-he-hey-iv ow-ow-owah guh-ray-hey-hey-hey-hey shush
Qwa-hey-qua-hey-heee-eeeen." (That's "God save our gracious queen," ballpark
style).;    And think of the children. Generation after generation of parents
bring their children to ballparks to introduce them to the national pastime.
Do we want these children later standing up in the assembly hall and saying:
"No, teacher, it starts like this: 'Oh-hoh-hey cah-han-you-see-uh-see-uh
by-the daw-haw-hawns err-uh-err-ee-uh-lee-lah-lite?"';    That isn't what
Francis Scott Key had in mind.;    On the other hand, some musicologists say
that the melody can be traced back to England where it had different lyrics
and was a drinking song. So maybe it's not totally inappropriate for today's
singers to sound as if they just downed a quart of Southern Comfort.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Legislation that would scrap ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' as the national anthem has riled people in
the hometown of Francis Scott Key, who wrote the song 175 years ago.
   ``I honestly feel they should leave it be,'' said Harry L.
Decker, Frederick's historian. ``I think it's more like a hymn than
a song. It brings tears to a lot of people's eyes.''
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr., D-Ind., has introduced legislation in
Congress for the ninth time in 12 years to supplant it with
``America the Beautiful.''
   Decker said Tuesday he thought the campaign for change was being
fueled by people who believe the song embraces war and by those who
think it's too hard to sing.
   ``If they can't sing it, they can't sing,'' Decker said.
   David Maloney Jr., president of the Historical Society of
Frederick County, said he liked ``America the Beautiful,'' but
thinks it's less ``emotionally stirring'' than ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.''
   The proposal to replace the national anthem also has struck a
sensitive chord with the Frederick Keys, the city's new minor
league baseball team.
   ``His monument (in Mount Olivet Cemetery) faces our new
stadium,'' said Mark Zeigler, the team's assistant general manager.
``I've got a lot of pride in this area and the state.
   ``This is something of local significance that is national. It
would take away some of the significance.''
   Frederick County Arts Council Director Carole Werking said: ``I
like `America the Beautiful.' I think it is easier to sing, but
Francis Scott Key being Frederick's native son and having a lot of
pride in my community, I don't think we should change it.''
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer has written to Maryland's
congressional delegation, urging them to oppose any change.
   Jacobs said the protests probably are unnecessary because he
doesn't think his bill will pass.

<LEADPARA>  Scott Erickson will not be the American League's starting pitcher in tonight's
62nd All-Star Game, but there will be a reminder of him on Toronto's SkyDome
mound.;    "I'm wearing the low socks in honor of Scotty," said Jack Morris,
Erickson's elder teammate at Minnesota and his replacement as the starting
pitcher. "I know how much he wanted to be here. He is by far the best pitcher
in the league at this point."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MORRIS GETS TO START TONIGHT IN PLACE OF TWINS TEAMMATE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  All-Star Game Preview;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 7/10/91, pg. 2E); 
Because of an editor's error, the junior college for which Minnesota Twins
pitcher Scott Erickson formerly played was incorrect in Tuesday's editions.
Erickson played for San Jose City College.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Erickson, from Homestead High and De Anza College in Cupertino, was 12-2
with a 1.83 ERA in this, his first full season. He would have started today,
but he was placed on the disabled list recently because of an elbow problem.; 
  While National League Manager Lou Piniella chose Atlanta's Tom Glavine to
start, counterpart Tony La Russa said he chose Morris because he is
right-handed.;    The only two A.L. left-handers are Toronto's Jimmy Key
(10-4) and California's Mark Langston (12-3). There was speculation that Key
might start in front of his home fans, but La Russa said he wants the
left-handers available in later innings. Morris was chosen over Boston's Roger
Clemens (11-5), who slowed after a sizzling start this season.;    Starting
was an unexpected honor for Morris, but then, this hasn't been the sort of
season that was expected from him. He had been the winningest pitcher of the
'80s, and seemingly was a Detroit Tigers lifer. Many people considered the
small-market Twins foolish for giving him $3 million this season as a free
agent. But Morris, 36, won seven in a row at one stretch and is 11-6 with a
3.65 ERA.; Franco pained; by fan voting;  As it turns out, Julio Franco has
had more to worry about than Roberto Alomar's ability.;    Franco, the Texas
Rangers' second baseman and last year's All-Star MVP, said Sunday that
Toronto's Alomar, voted the A.L. starter in fan balloting, does not deserve to
start ahead of him at second base. Franco left Arlington Stadium after saying
that -- and was checked into a nearby hospital because of chest discomfort.;  
 The diagnosis was that the problem was caused by a combination of the heat
and caffeine; he was discharged Monday morning.;    Alomar is hitting .284
with 37 RBIs, 27 steals and eight errors.;    "He can keep talking all he
wants," Alomar said of Franco, who is hitting .318 with 40 RBIs, 17 steals and
11 errors. "He's going to have to wait five or six innings before he gets into
the All-Star Game.";    Who says All-Star games aren't exciting anymore?; Like
old times; for Sanderson;  Dave Henderson, Rickey Henderson, Dennis Eckersley,
Scott Sanderson, Dave Duncan, Rene Lachemann and Tommie Reynolds. Which one of
those names does not belong?;    If you said Sanderson, you're technically
correct. He no longer represents the A's, but those seven lockers are side-by-
side in the A.L. clubhouse. For Sanderson, who is 9-3 since the A's let him to
go the New York Yankees as a free agent, this is like old times.;    "Any time
I think about my days with the A's, I just have a real good feeling," said
Sanderson, who won 17 games last season but was not re-signed, purely for
economic reasons. "I think I'm a much better player for having played in
Oakland. A lot of players can go their whole careers and not get a chance to
be on a team like that."; Ripken wins home run battle;   Cal Ripken's 18
homers were the most by a major league shortstop before the All-Star break
since Rico Petrocelli had 23 in 1969. The Baltimore iron man has been doing it
all this season, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he made such sluggers
as Cecil Fielder, Howard Johnson and Joe Carter look like lightweights
Monday.;    Ripken won the Home Run Derby with 12 homers in 20 swings, seven
more than the nearest competitor, Cincinnati's Paul O'Neill. Fielder hit
four.;    Ripken amazed the lunchtime crowd by hitting seven of the first
eight pitches for homers.;    "Lachemann just kept saying, 'Geez,' " Ripken
said of the A's coach, who served as the derby's catcher. "It's funny, I got
to take a few extra swings in (batting practice), and I was going to right
field. I didn't feel I'd be able to take it up a notch. It didn't feel good.";
Carter learns how sweet it is;  After all those 100-RBI seasons, Joe Carter
finally made it to an All-Star Game. The fact that he is playing before his
newest home fans obviously makes it even sweeter.;    "It was a long time
coming, but that's been the way with my entire career," said Carter, who was
traded with Roberto Alomar from San Diego over the winter for Fred McGriff and
Tony Fernandez. "People doubted my ability, and that drove me. Hopefully,
people will keep doubting me and I'll keep proving them wrong."; Please
explain that again, Lou;   Piniella tried to explain why he chose Montreal's
Ivan Calderon over Chicago's George Bell to sub for Darryl Strawberry.;    "We
have two natural left fielders on the team," Piniella said. "Calderon is
having a good season, plus he knows the A.L. well. He's faced Morris quite a
few times.";    Didn't Bell also just come from a long A.L. career?; Butler is
bearing no grudges;  Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Brett Butler, making
his first All-Star appearance, said he holds no grudges against Giants General
Manager Al Rosen. Last winter, Rosen chose to let Butler become a free agent
and signed Willie McGee as his replacement.;    "He's like a father to me,"
Butler said. "Say a father does something his son doesn't understand -- you
still love him. It doesn't mean I don't respect him. . . . I was very close to
Al, and I still am.";    Butler said he wants to talk about the past winter
with Rosen over dinner but said his schedule has been too busy. "I just want
to hear it," he said. "I just want to know what went through his mind.";    As
for Rosen's future, Butler predicted, "Al's not going to step away until he's
back. Al Rosen will not step down until that team is back where it should be.
To go from one extreme to the other, they want it back. Roger (Craig) is the
same way. It's more for (Giants owner) Bob Lurie, because of the man he is."  </TEXT>

Bing and Lou Russell shifted uncomfortably in their seats, growing ever more 
irate as the heckler, a few rows back, continued his relentless diatribe. The 
target was the first baseman for the visiting Peoria (Ill.) Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, number nine, hustle to your position," the man yelled in a thick Latino 
accent. "You're better than that, nine. Stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 happened to be Matt Franco, the Russells' grandson. Finally, they had 
heard enough. Lou turned to confront the loudmouth, then gasped in 
astonishment. It was her son, Kurt Russell, doing one of his better acting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, best known for his roles in such films as "Silkwood," "Escape From New 
York" and "The Best of Times," had only the best of intentions, however. He 
wanted to fire up Franco without revealing his identity. No one knew Kurt was 
at the game in Rockford, Ill., not even his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him for a while, and when the inning ended, I looked up and it was 
Kurt," Franco said. "He was dressed to conceal his identity. He's gotta go 
incognito." 
</P>
<P>
Franco, whose mother Jill is Kurt's sister, rapidly is establishing his own 
identity. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter from Westlake High, Franco is 
challenging for the Midwest League batting title. With 13 games to play, he is 
batting .290, 15 points behind league-leader Scott Cepicky of South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Franco has batted .382 the past month for the Chicago Cubs' Class-A affiliate 
after beginning the season in a horrendous slump. 
</P>
<P>
Like any 20-year-old from Southern California, Franco saw his spirits -- and 
batting average -- rise along with the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few weeks were ridiculous. Some nights it was 18 degrees with the 
wind-chill factor," Franco said. "Who can hit when your hands are numb?" 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled: They have used pitches rather than pitchforks, but two former 
Arizona State Sun Devils have helped toss former Camarillo High right-hander 
Travis Willis from Peoria's starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs assigned Lance Dickson, their 1990 No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona 
State, to Peoria on July 4. After four starts, Dickson was promoted. He is now 
with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Dickson at Peoria was Troy Bradford, the team's third-round draft 
pick, also out of Arizona State. About the same time, Manager Greg Mahlberg 
decided to stick with a four-man rotation after using five starters much of the 
season. All of which left Willis in long relief. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Willis seemed an odd choice for banishment to the bullpen. The 
former Cal standout was 8-9 with an earned-run average of 3.18 in 20 starts for 
the Chiefs (49-77), who are last in the Midwest League. With five complete 
games he still ranks among league leaders and he has walked only 39 in 154 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My control worked against me," Willis said. "They told me I'm a guy they can 
count on to come in and throw strikes. I was a better candidate for the bullpen 
than somebody who can't find the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Willis has been hit hard in relief -- he is now 9-11 with a 3.49 ERA -- and 
Mahlberg might be having a change of heart. Willis got a start against Waterloo 
(Iowa) on Friday night and gave up one earned run, getting the win in the 
Chiefs' 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Toledo: How Scott Muckey made his professional coaching debut at age 37 is 
basically a travel story. Certainly, it's circuitous. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Toledo (Ohio) Mud Hens, John Wockenfuss, was afraid to fly, 
so he was told to hit the road. The lone coach, Aurelio Rodriguez, had family 
problems in Mexico, so he took off south of the border, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamboa, the new Mud Hen manager, called Muckey, a longtime friend, July 18 
and asked if he had two months to spare. Muckey was on the next flight to 
Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me all of a few seconds to make the decision," said Muckey, who had 
planned to spend the summer in his usual manner -- coaching an American Legion 
team and helping out at baseball camps. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, the Crespi High coach, has been at the high school or junior college 
levels since his playing career ended at Pepperdine in 1974. All of a sudden, 
he found himself pitching batting practice and coaching first base for the 
Detroit Tigers' triple-A International League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
In Muckey's first game, Toledo played Oklahoma City, which coincidentally is 
managed by Steve Smith, a friend of Muckey's. "He was kind of surprised to see 
me," Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie coach trotted out to the first-base coach's box. The first Toledo 
batter singled . . . and was promptly picked off. The next Toledo batter 
doubled . . . and was picked off. Two innings later, a Toledo batter singled . 
. . and was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Smitty's over there in the dugout laughing at me," Muckey recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey has earned respect with his understated manner and knowledge of the 
game. Yet he is a mere chick among the Mud Hens in terms of professional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made all the rookie mistakes. Just trying to keep track of the time 
schedule is hard enough," he said, chuckling. "I was running out there with my 
uniform on when we were supposed to be in batting practice tops." 
</P>
<P>
Another day he forgot his cap. "If they were serious about fining me, they 
could have slapped me for $150 for not being in the right place at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The fans have been less forgiving. During a game in Richmond, Va., Muckey 
fielded a foul ball down the first-base line and tossed it to the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was all over me," he said. "I don't know why. But now when a ball 
comes near me, I watch it roll by." 
</P>
<P>
The season itself is flying by. Muckey is enjoying every minute, but after a 
month beating around the bush leagues, he paints a less-than-romantic picture: 
Sit around a hotel room until 3 or 4 p.m., head to the ballpark, try to wind 
down after midnight. The next day, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pro life's for everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a lot of kids looking to be pro players are in for a little bit of a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, not being much for night life, has used his time in the hotel room to 
prepare for his Crespi teaching duties -- school begins Sept. 3, one day after 
the Mud Hens' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm studying up on physiology," he said without enthusiasm. "That's what they 
have me teaching this year."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Prepping for Albertville
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5
</SO>
<LP>

to date, there will be an Olympics, the winter one, in
Albertville, France, beginning in about 10 weeks. And the
U.S. will field a hockey team as usual, although there's been
little fuss about that, either.
   "There's been less hype this time around -- no doubt about
that," affirmed Dave Peterson, the hockey team's coach,
before his charges faced the St. Louis Blues of the National
Hockey League here Monday night in the 35th game of its
60-game pre-Olympic tour.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Peterson thought the lack of attention here to the
February winter games is "probably because expectations of
our doing well haven't been as high as they were prior to
previous Games." But he made it clear he wasn't complaining:
"If I had my way, it'd be quieter yet. The fewer distractions
we have, the easier it is to prepare a squad. And public
relations isn't exactly the thing I do best."
   Ah, yes, public relations. You'll recall (or, maybe, you
don't) that Peterson coached our last Olympic hockey team, at
Calgary in 1988. And unlike the U.S.'s "Miracle on Ice" gang
that won a gold medal at Lake Placid in 1980, its 3-3
won-lost record, and seventh-place finish in a field of 12,
defined mediocrity. But he enlivened things by answering
questions about the club's performance by questioning his
questioners' motives and intelligence.
   Before he got the job this time around, USA Hockey, which
runs this particular show, insisted Peterson take a course in
responding to the news media. The long-time Minnesota high
school coach obliged, and reports that the experience was
relatively painless.
   "We did some role playing. I even held the notebook for
awhile," he said, smiling. "I think I learned a few things,
but it didn't really change my perspective. As I saw it, the
problem at Calgary was that some reporters wanted me to
negatively evaluate individual players, and I wouldn't do it.
Given the same circumstances, I'd probably react the same way
again. But all in all, I enjoyed Calgary, and learned there,
too. And, maybe, the circumstances won't be the same this
time."
   The fact that Team USA was here, playing the NHL Blues,
reflects one thing that Peterson learned in '88. The '88 team
compiled a gaudy, 37-18-5 pre-Olympic record, but it was
achieved mainly at the expense of U.S. collegiate teams that
offered little competition or preparation for Olympic-level
hockey. The record of this year's crew after a 6-4 loss to
the Blues Monday is 14-16-5, but it probably means more
because it comes mostly from a tougher card of NHL or elite
foreign teams.
   The U.S. defeated a Soviet national team in an August
tournament in France and holds a 2-2-2 record after two,
three-game sets against the Canadian Nationals. Its 3-10-2
mark against NHL competition includes wins over the Minnesota
North Stars and San Jose Sharks (two) and ties with the
Philadelphia Flyers and Buffalo Sabres.
   Peterson's '88 team was faulted for loose defense,
especially during an Olympics in which it surrendered 31
goals in six outings. The coach says that was partly an
offshoot of a free-wheeling style that produced a lot of
goals as well, and wonders aloud why a 3-1 defeat should be
preferable to one of 7-5. That, not incidentally, was the
score by which Team USA fell to the favored Czechs and
gold-medal-winning Soviets at Calgary. And while he admits
his current crew has been "overpowered" on occasion by bigger
NHL outfits, he says "we expect our speed to make us better
defensively this time around" once it gets on the larger ice
surface used in international play.
   Withal, the coach says this team shapes up as faster and
deeper than his last unit, and one that contains a better
blend of youth and experience. Among the younger players
showing early foot are Shawn McEachern, a 22-year-old wing
out of Boston University who is its leading scorer with 18
goals and 15 assists in 31 games; Scott Lachance, a speedy,
18-year-old defenseman from the same school; and Ted Drury, a
19-year-old center from Harvard. In the experience category,
nobody tops center Scott Fusco. He's a 28-year-old Harvard
grad who was a member of the 1984 and '88 Olympic teams. As
far as he knows, no one else ever played for the U.S. in
three Olympics in the sport.
   Fusco, a smallish redhead, quit hockey after the last
Games and went to work in his family's computer business in
Winchester, Mass. Last July 4, though, he got back on skates,
found he could still stand and liked the feeling, and so
again reported for duty. "A lot of people played sports in
college, and quite a few are pros, but being an Olympian puts
you in a special club," he says by way of explanation.
   Goalie is, probably, the key position in the six- or
eight-game Olympic hockey sprint, and the identity of the man
or men who will protect the nets for Team USA is still in
doubt. Scott Gordon, formerly of the NHL's Quebec Nordiques,
and Les Kuntar, out of St. Lawrence U., split the post until
Kuntar suffered a broken jaw. Ray LeBlanc, a veteran minor
leaguer, took Kuntar's place and gave up but four goals in
three games before Monday night. The Blues got him for six,
but the number easily could have been nine or 10, and
Peterson later expressed himself as impressed.
   The world has changed since the '88 Games, and in ways
that may improve U.S. chances for a hockey medal. Most
obviously, some of the best Soviet players have opted for
capitalism and will be playing for the NHL's lucre while
others maintain the honor of what's left of the USSR at
Albertville. But people who know about such things say there
are sufficient proficient icemen left to make the Sovs the
choice for their eighth Olympic gold medal in the sport in
the last 10 quadrenniums, with the Swedes, Finns, Czechs and
Canadians not far behind.
   U.S. teams have done pretty well in recent international
tournaments, finishing fifth in the last World Championships
and second in the 1990 Goodwill Games. The brusque, beefy
Peterson opines that "despite what some people thought, we
weren't all that far out of it" in '88, and says he expects a
medal this time.
   "That's why we have a team," he says. "If it isn't,
nobody's told me."

   O'er the ramparts rained criticism of Roseanne
Barr's screeching, off-key rendition of the national anthem at a
baseball game, but the comedian defended her conduct even if her
wailing solo struck out.
   ``Geez, gimme a break. I was just trying to sing a song,'' the
caustic star of the ABC sitcom ``Roseanne'' told Los Angeles-area
television station KCAL in a telephone interview broadcast Thursday
night.
   Barr conceded she was ``no Beverly Sills,'' referring to the
famed opera singer. She said she has a naturally shrill singing
voice.
   ``I apologize that people were so appalled,'' she said.
   But she added: ``If this is the worst thing they ever heard,
they've had it really easy.'' Barr said if she ever sang the anthem
again she'd ``want to do it for a hipper crowd.''
   President Bush, flying to Kennebunkport, Maine, for the weekend,
said today that Barr's rendition was ``disgraceful. That's the way
I feel about it and I think a lot of San Diego fans said the same
thing.''
   Fans at Jack Murphy Stadium, where the San Diego Padres were
playing a doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds, booed Barr after
the shrieking performance Wednesday.
   After screaming the final notes, she grabbed her crotch and spit
on the field.
   Barr told KCAL the crotch-grabbing gesture and spitting were
meant to parody mannerisms common among some baseball players, not
to show disrepect for the anthem or booing fans.
   The comedy actress had been invited to sing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' by her boss, Tom Werner, the co-creator and executive
producer of ``Roseanne.'' Earlier this year, Werner led a 15-member
investment group that bought the Padres for $75 million. He is now
chairman and managing partner of the team.
   Padres headquarters were deluged by 1,200 calls Thursday, mostly
complaints. The team issued an apology and said in the statement
that they ``recognize their obligation to ensure the national
anthem is sung with respect and dignity.''
   National League President William D. White said: ``We have
discussed it with the Padres and are in agreement with their
apology. We are satisfied that they will take all necessary steps
to assure it will not happen again.''
   On Thursday night, before their game against the Houston Astros,
the Padres played a taped version of the national anthem performed
by the Marine Corps. The crowd gave it a rousing ovation.
   Barr's caterwauling rendition was the subject of much of Johnny
Carson's ``Tonight Show'' monologue Thursday night.
   ``Francis Scott Key must be spinning like a lathe,'' he quipped,
referring to the anthem's composer. ``The closest sound I heard was
when I got my cat neutered.''
   Others leveled more serious criticism.
   ``It was to me like burning of the flag,'' said Robert Merrill,
70, who has been singing the national anthem in New York's Yankee
Stadium for 18 years.
   Padres pitcher Eric Show said, ``It's an insult. There are
people who died for that song.''
   About 30,000 people attended the doubleheader promoted as
``Working Women's Night.''
   ``I was embarrassed for the women who showed up,'' said
spectator Jannette Davis of San Diego. ``This was supposed to be a
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel
like crap.''
   It wasn't the first time Barr achieved notoriety at a baseball
game. In the stands during a World Series game in Oakland last
fall, she bared her bottom, revealing a tattoo declaring ``Tom'' _
her husband, Tom Arnold.
   On Thursday, Arnold urged critics to lighten up.
   ``They knew what kind of singer she is. She's just an average
singer. She's not an opera singer,'' Arnold told The Associated
Press by telephone from their Malibu home. ``She did the best she
could.''
   Barr wouldn't come to the telephone, but was troubled by the
criticism, he said.
   ``She's very sorry,'' Arnold said. ``She's very upset that
people think she meant disrespect.''

<HEAD>Birthplace of National Anthem Rallies to Its Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Oh say, can you sing the national anthem?
   Most people can't, says a congressman from Indiana who wants to
scrap ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as the nation's official song in
favor of the less straining ``America the Beautiful.''
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs also says the poem penned by Francis Scott
Key after American troops repelled British forces at Baltimore's
Fort McHenry in 1814 is unsuitable because it celebrates war and
because the tune's origin is an old drinking song _ and an English
one, to boot.
   Jacobs' introduction of a bill to make the change, though
nothing new, has provoked a spirited defense.
   ``Who says you can't sing it?'' demanded Maryland Historical
Society spokeswoman Darlene Frank.
   The society held a contest in September to commemorate the 175th
anniversary of the writing of the anthem and found ``more than 300
patriotic Americans who loved the song enough to want to sing it in
public ... and a capella, no less,'' Frank wrote in a letter
dismissing Jacob's proposal.
   The Democrat has introduced the bill nine times in 12 years,
without gaining any appreciable support.
   ``It's not a burning issue in my existence,'' Jacobs said.
   Still, he does not plan to forego the campaign. ``America the
Beautiful'' is gradually eclipsing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as
the song of choice at official functions, he said.
   In Maryland, Gov. William Donald Schaefer has asked the state's
congressional delegation to oppose Jacobs' bill. The Frederick,
Md., Keys, a minor league baseball team named for the composer,
also opposes the change.
   Karen Stuart, head librarian at the Maryland Historical Society,
said the latest attempt to replace the anthem has prompted more
outcry that in the past.
   The public may be more sensitive because of the emphasis on the
Pledge of Allegiance during the 1988 presidential campaign and the
Supreme Court's ruling last summer that the burning of the flag is
a protected form of free speech.
   Key wrote the anthem to commemorate the defense of Fort McHenry,
where citizen soldiers withstood 25 hours of bombardment from
British ships during the War of 1812.
   Key almost certainly took some poetic liberties in his most
famous verse. Historians say it is unlikely he saw the flag
``gallantly streaming'' because it would have been soggy after a
night of pounding rain. And Stuart said some scholars question
whether the rockets' red glare was sufficient to illuminate the
banner through the smoke and mist from as far away as the truce
ship which Key was aboard.
   Flawed or not, ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' enjoyed immediate
popularity in the young nation. The melody was ``To Anacreon in
Heaven,'' the slightly bawdy theme song of a private men's club in
London. The tune became well-known on both sides of the Atlantic
but didn't get official recognition until 1931.
   Its rival _ the tribute to spacious skies and amber waves of
grain _ was written in the late 19th century by a Wellesley College
English literature professor, Katherine Lee Bates.
   Jacobs said he was impressed by the story of how Bates was
inspired to write ``America the Beautiful,'' not by an armed
conflict, but by the beauty she beheld from the peak of a Colorado
mountain.
   But neither song is Jacobs' personal favorite among patriotic
tunes.
   ``I like `This Land Is Your Land,''' he said.

<LEADPARA>  THIS SUNDAY, March 3, marks the 60th anniversary of our national anthem, "The
Star-Spangled Banner." I'll bet you thought that the song was more than 60
years old -- and it is. But it was officially adopted as our national anthem
by the U.S. Congress and President Herbert Hoover on March 3, 1931.;    The
words were composed during the War of 1812 by a lawyer from Washington, D.C.
named Francis Scott Key, whose involvement in the whole matter was quite
accidental. Key had been persuaded by several friends of a physician named
William Beanes, who had become a prisoner of war, to negotiate with the
British navy for the release of the doctor. For some reason, Dr. Beanes had
been picked up by soldiers off the streets of Washington during a British
assault on the city that had resulted in the burning of the White House, the
Capitol, and other public buildings. He was taken back to the British naval
ships that had blockaded Chesapeake Bay, and it is there that Key went to
obtain his release.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Well, the talks were courteous and an agreement was reached, but there
happened to be other talks under way at the same time, on that same ship, and
these concerned the battle plans for that night's attack on Baltimore and on
Fort McHenry, which guarded the city. The British didn't know how much of
their plans Key and Dr. Beanes had overheard, and so they detained the
Americans until after the battle had commenced.;    From here on the story is,
or should be, rather well known by all American school children. Key was so
taken by the bombardment he witnessed from the deck of the ship that night
(the British lobbed more than 1,800 bombs and rockets into and around the
fort) and he was so stirred upon seeing the American flag still flying over
the fort at daybreak, that he hastily composed several verses of a poem on the
back of a letter or an envelope he found in his pocket.;    That poem, which
appeared shortly thereafter in a Baltimore newspaper under the title "The
Defense of Fort McHenry," became the words for what we know as "The
Star-Spangled Banner." The war in the Persian Gulf has made the playing and
singing of our national anthem more common and frequent than just at the
beginning of sporting events.;    Many children know the words but have little
understanding of what some of those words mean. Parents can help put some of
the meaning and flavor back into this song by telling their children how the
anthem came to be written. (Be sure they see that the event, and the War of
1812, took place only about forty years after the Revolution, and so our
fledgling nation could easily have come under British rule once again if Fort
McHenry had fallen.) Recite the anthem to them like a poem, and translate for
them the following words and phrases:;    The Star-Spangled Banner: "Spangled"
means adorned with shining or glittering objects; sequins, for example, are
spangles.;    What so proudly we hailed: "Hailed" means cheered for or
applauded.;    O'er the ramparts we watched: "O'er" is the one-syllable,
poetic pronunciation of the word "over"; "ramparts" are protective barriers,
in this case the walls of Fort McHenry.;    The bombs bursting in air:
Explosives weren't actually dropped from above until 1849 (from balloons), and
so this early use of "bombs" refers to mortar shells that were launched over
the walls from the ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     As Madonna became a singing sensation, there were ripple effects in Fremont
in the life of Madonna Pride. The phone started ringing in the middle of the
night with callers wanting to talk to Madonna.;    When she ordered food by
phone, clerks often thought the call was a prank. A friend of her family who
works at the pizza parlor heard the following conversation.;    "Hey, Madonna
just placed an order," someone yelled in the restaurant after she had ordered
pizza.;    "Yeah, right," another employee quipped back, "and Elvis called up
for pizza, too.";    Fremont's Madonna is the mother of three and a product of
Catholic schools. Sometimes when she says her name and adds that she works as
a bookkeeper for Sisters of the Holy Family, people think she's a nun.;    In
Price Club one day, Madonna had just finished paying for her items when the
checker waved the check in the air and yelled to another employee: "Hey Bob,
here's another star." The checker was talking to Price Club employee, Bob
Wagoner.;    "My daughter and her friends think it's cool that my name is
Madonna," says Madonna Pride.;    On her daughters' field trips if anyone gets
out of line, Fremont's Madonna threatens to sing.;    "I think she's
outrageous, unique, a free spirit," says Madonna Pride about her more famous
namesake.;    Madonna is not the only one whose name gets attention in her
family. She's been married to Rusty Pride for more than 20 years. At a
marriage encounter follow-up years ago, another couple showed up just to see
what a Rusty Pride looked like.;    "It's just kind of fun," Madonna says
about their names. "I don't take it too seriously.";     IN A COLUMN a few
weeks ago about Ed Shannon's son-in-law, who is an underwater photographer and
writer, I couldn't weave in a comment from Ed about his experience traveling
inland after scuba diving off the coast of New Guinea.;    In the highlands
where people still live as they did thousands of years ago with painted faces
and using bows and arrows, Ed asked what the older natives had thought of the
fighter planes that flew overhead during World War II.;    The sound signaled
giant bees droning overhead. The natives ran for cover in the jungles.;     IT
WAS THE car that Bob Wheeler of Fremont courted Diane in before they were
married. During Bob's military service, the car was resigned to a chicken barn
on a Fresno ranch Diane's father owned.;    The 1956 Chevy that's been babied
and repainted and is in a never-ending process of being restored is headed for
its longest trip yet. Diane and Bob are driving the car across some of the
western states, as it is being passed from one generation to the next.;   
It's a gift from Dad to son, David, a recent graduate of Brigham Young
University, who adores the car as much as his father does.;    When she
started graduate work in library science, one of her mentors encouraged Lauren
Teixeira of Fremont to look for vast resources as she studied the Costanoan
Indians.;    She developed a descriptive guide on "Access to Information on
Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of San Francisco and Monterey Bay Areas" as her
thesis and assembled a first of its kind resource guide on tribal organization
and the rancherias in Mendocino County in a grant project.;    For Lauren, a
five-year journey through school has ended. She finished two years
undergraduate work and three years of graduate studies to earn her master's
degree in library science from San Jose State University this month.;    With
the workload of family and her children's schedules, a job and studies
becoming unwieldy at times, she discovered an equally vast resource within
herself, through children's storytelling and writing of poetry.;    "A Lament:
From One Friend (Married with Children) to Another Friend (Single, No
Entanglements)" is one from her poetry collection that working mothers may
relate to:;    I envy you;    your solitude --;    Your house quietly filled; 
  with the color of your creativity;    flowing into every room;    filling
your universe infinitely you . . .;    While I make appointments;    for
solitude;    late at night;    in a sleeping house;    where I find my
creativity;    in sputters and spurts,;    splotches, splashes;    caught
somewhere between;    exhaustion and dreams.;    Since the two Teixeira
children, Zachary and Laural, are used to having a parent attending college,
their dad will finish his degree, starting full-time this month as he holds
down a full-time job.;     A YEAR OR SO ago, I wrote a column about Ray
Gatchalian, an Oakland Fire Captain, who produced the video "Unheard Voices"
that aired on PBS about the children of war-ravaged El Salvador.;    Ray, who
can't sit still, is running across the United States, having left on Flag Day
from the Francis Scott Key Monument in Golden Gate Park with 19 other runners
who plan to hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Washington, D. C. on July 2.
As they run, Ray and the others carry a replica of the 15-star flag that flew
over Fort McHenry when it was being bombarded by the British in 1814,
inspiration for Francis Scott Key to write the Star Spangled Banner. The run
across America is designed to call attention and contribution to a Francis
Scott Key Memorial to be built at the foot of the bridge by July 4, 1993.;   
When I talked to Ray last, he was in Vernal, Utah, having run through the
foothills of the Sierra, the high desert of Nevada and heading through the
Rockies.;    "The sunsets, the sunrises, the landscape pastels. The horses and
birds. You get to hear everything come up in that golden hour as the sun
spreads its light," says Ray.;    "It's just incredible. When you're running
down the middle of the highway at one and two in the morning, with the Milky
Way blazing, it gives you an opportunity to think what America is about."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian brewers Elders IXL Ltd. launched a
takeover bid Monday for Scottish and Newcastle PLC, valuing the
British brewer at the equivalent of $2.8 billion.
   Elders, through its Courage Holdings PLC subsidiary, is offering
400 pence, or $7 a share in cash for the Scottish-based drinks
company best known for its Newcastle brown ale.
   The Australian company, which makes the popular Fosters brand
lager, said it already owns 9.65 percent of Scottish and
Newcastle's share capital.
   Following the announcement, Scottish and Newcastle stock shot
above the Elders offer price in London to 426 pence from Friday's
closing price of 351 pence.
   Elders already owns Courage, one of the best-known names in
British beer, which it bought in 1986 for 1.4 billion pounds.
   It also owns 13.5 percent of Greene King, another British
brewer, and just under 1 percent of the American company
Anheuser-Busch, the world's biggest brewer.
   Elders is best known for its beer and lager, but it also has a
financial services company and interests in agriculture and mining.

<P>
COACH: Steve Wahl, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-15; 4th in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Wahl replaces Joe Dunn, who stepped down after 12 seasons in 
August because of personal reasons. Three junior starters, swingman Brian Lee 
(6-foot-3), point guard Bryon Camacho (5-7) and guard Ignacio Castro (6-0) 
return. Wahl calls Lee the top all-around player. "He can play forward, guard 
or center and score and rebound," Wahl said. Camacho averaged 11.6 points a 
game last season and is the catalyst for an offense that will play an up-tempo 
game. "He makes everything go," said Wahl, who also coaches the boys' and 
girls' tennis teams. "We have good team speed and we want to take advantage of 
it." Two juniors, forward Damien Scott (6-2) and center Joe Bunning (6-5), 
round out the starting lineup. Scott and Bunning will be the dominant forces 
under the boards. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The team, which did not participate in summer league because of Wahl's 
late hiring, has eight underclassmen on its 12-man roster. "It's been difficult 
just trying to get it going with a new philosophy, but I think we'll come 
around once they catch on," Wahl said. Wahl believes Harvard and St. Francis 
and possibly El Segundo could contend for the league championship, but he 
believes that Bell-Jeff should finish no lower than third.

<P>
COACH: Greg Hilliard, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-3; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Seven players return from last season's San Fernando Valley 
League championship team, which advanced to the Southern Section 3-A Division 
semifinals. Forward Andres Carlo (6-4) and center Spencer Miller (6-8), both 
seniors, are returning starters. Carlo played in all 26 games, averaging 10 
points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 1.5 blocks. Carlo and Miller should be 
strong inside forces, but Hilliard said that Carlo also is an effective outside 
threat. Iheanyi Uwaezouke (6-2), a Division I football prospect, and Marcus 
Puhvel (6-5) received significant playing time as juniors. Newcomer Tarlin Ray 
(6-2), a junior point guard, rounds out the starting five. Hilliard said that 
Puhvel probably is the best outside shooter and that Uwaezouke and Ray are the 
best ballhandlers. Harvard averaged more than 85 points a game last season and 
Hilliard thinks this year's team can duplicate that effort. "We're definitely a 
running team with a full-pressure defense," Hilliard said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our strength is our conditioning and we have good athletes that have 
yet to be proven," said Hilliard, who has guided Harvard to two league titles 
and four playoff berths in five seasons. "Last year's team was tight and 
cohesive and how well we come together will be the determining factor."

<P>
COACH: John Jordan, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-15; 5th in league, 2-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kyle Barrett (6-3), Dave Landa (5-3) and Marty Konrad (6-3) 
return and are expected to play key roles. Barrett is the Golden Knights' main 
offensive threat and averaged 16.4 points last season. Landa, who averaged 
eight points and 5.1 assists, will play point guard. Konrad averaged seven 
rebounds last season. Junior Tory Carruthers (6-3) also will start. Four 
sophomores and two juniors with no varsity experience round out the team. 
"Hopefully, we can build around (Barrett, Landa and Konrad) and find some other 
kids to help them out," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Jordan believes that the basketball team will benefit from the move 
from the Del Rey League to the San Fernando Valley League in the same manner as 
the football team, which improved from 1-9 to 7-4. But Jordan is unsure of what 
to expect. "I have no idea what we'll do," Jordan said. "We're so young. I'm 
not sure what kind of character this team is going to have."

St. Genevieve 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Scott Smith, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-20; 6th in league, 0-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guards Jeff De La O (5-9) and Josh Smith (5-10) 
started last season and are among seven returning players. De La O, who 
averaged 10 points, will be relied upon for his offensive output. Smith will be 
the primary ballhandler. Junior center Pat Rodriguez (6-2) and junior John 
Hoffmann (6-2) and senior Victor Dionisio (5-11), both forwards, also will 
start. Pete Miranda (5-10), Dominic Parero (5-9) and Mike Robinson (6-1), a 
transfer from Crespi, also will be given extensive playing time. "We don't have 
any size so everybody is going to have to crash the boards," Smith said. "Once 
we get the ball, we'll be all right." Smith says quickness is the team's most 
valuable asset and that he will utilize a motion offense. "We'll set screens 
and try to roll out of them." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: St. Genevieve should be improved, but Smith believes the league, in 
particular St. Francis and Harvard, is very strong. "It was a long season and 
we didn't get any wins (last year)," Smith said, "but we have only one way to 
go. We don't have any outstanding individual, but we work well as a team."

   Paul Kidwell would like to see Manfred
Mann replace Francis Scott Key as the man associated with the
national anthem.
   Kidwell has formed a group to promote replacing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' with ``Do Wah Diddy.''
   ``It's just one of my favorite songs. It was a real hard choice
between that and another of my favorites, `Mack the Knife,''' said
Kidwell, founder and self-appointed president of America, Change the
Anthem Now _ America CAN.
   Kidwell said the only good rendition he has ever heard of the
anthem was by Marvin Gaye at a basketball game.
   ``I don't like the song,'' Kidwell said of the notoriously
hard-to-sing anthem. ``It's stodgy, staid, not easy to dance to and,
frankly, may be the worst song ever written. I'd give it about a
35.''
   Kidwell, who works for a subliminal tapes manufacturer in Grand
Rapids, said he doesn't expect his suggestion to survive. ``After
all, the other piece has been around, what, 200 years? But that
doesn't mean I have to like the song,'' he said.
   ``Do Wah Diddy,'' made famous by Mann in 1964, ``embodies the
American dream. You know, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with
girl, boy gets girl,'' Kidwell said.
   ``Besides, we need something upbeat.''

   Try explaining to the Postal Service and the
telephone company that while you have a new address, you still live
in the same house.
   That's what Lowry Air Force Base residents faced when officials
began changing street names eight weeks ago to make military
addresses conform to the surrounding area.
   Base residents simply had to send change-of-address cards
supplied by the post office.
   Then they began receiving hefty installation charges for phones
and cable television subscriptions that had been in place for years.
   ``I can understand how that would happen,'' said Debbie Thomas, U
S West phone company spokeswoman. ``About 99.9 percent of the time,
when you have an address change on an account, the computers assume
that's a location change.''
   For some, the trouble didn't stop there. Neither did the postal
carrier.
   ``We need a good, solid address in order to deliver mail,'' said
Postal Service spokesman Scott Budny. ``In this case, there were so
many different ways of addressing the mail that the people who lived
at the address didn't know how to address their own mail.''
   To make matters worse, some of the new street names duplicated
names of streets in suburban Northglenn, Budny said. ``Our clerks
weren't used to a street named Rampart being on Lowry Air Force
Base.''
   About 2 percent of the mail to those families was marked ``Return
to Sender'' before problems were resolved.

AUGMON ACCOMPLISHES TASK: RENDERING WEAPON HARMLESS

Forward Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas is always assigned to check the 
toughest opposing player. When UNLV faced Georgia Tech in an NCAA tournament 
semifinal game Saturday, he was assigned to Dennis Scott, the top gun in 
Georgia Tech's Lethal Weapon 3 offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big challenge," Augmon said. "I knew he was looking forward to 
playing against me and he took the challenge and came out launching. I couldn't 
stop him in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
Scott scored 20 points in the first 20 minutes as Georgia Tech took a 53-46 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Augmon limited Scott to nine points in the second half as the Rebels won, 
90-81, to advance to the NCAA championship game Monday night against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"Stacey played great defense in the second half," guard Anderson Hunt said. "He 
knew what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
What Augmon had to do was play more aggressively against Scott. 
</P>
<P>
After making five of eight shots in the first half, including four three-point 
shots, Scott didn't touch the ball in the first five minutes of the second half 
because of Augmon. "He played great defense on me the second half," Scott said. 
"He denied me the ball. I think the whole Vegas team was denying us the ball 
and it got us out of our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Although Augmon did a good job on Scott in the second half, he thought he could 
have done a better job in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott's a great player," Augmon said. "You can't take anything from him. He 
still got 29. The thing I tried to do was hold him to the lowest possible 
points. I can't go out and stop anyone. Great players are going to hit shots on 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But Tarkanian thought Augmon was being too modest. 
</P>
<P>
"In all fairness to Stacey, Scott got quite a few of his points when we were in 
our zone," Tarkanian said. "It seemed like every time we went to a zone he hit 
a three-pointer and made us pay for it. I don't know how many he got directly 
off Stacey, but I'm sure half of them came off our zone." 
</P>
<P>
As the Rebels' best defensive player, Augmon said he takes more pride in his 
defense than his offense. And he has shut down some of the nation's best 
offensive players, such as Temple guard Mark Macon, who had 11 points before 
fouling out in a loss to UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Although Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins praised the aggressive defense Augmon 
played on Scott, he felt Scott stopped himself in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Stacey couldn't stop Dennis Scott overall," Cremins said. "He's a heck 
of a defender, but no one can stop Dennis Scott. The only one who can stop 
Dennis Scott is Dennis Scott. But Augmon is a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the game in a zone defense, UNLV switched to a man-to-man defense 
at the start of the second half. The defense seemed to confuse Georgia Tech, 
which shot 66.7% in the first half. The Yellow Jackets shot just 34.5% in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the second half we played really well defensively," Tarkanian said. 
"We got after it real good and we shut down a lot of things. The first half we 
didn't play with the intensity we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels opened the second half with a 17-4 run as Augmon scored five points. 
While Augmon is recognized for his defense, he also is a good offensive player 
as he proved last Sunday by scoring 33 points against Loyola Marymount and 
Saturday with 22 against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"I take more pride in my defense than my offense," Augmon said. "A lot of 
people say I should take more pride in my offense because it will take me 
farther in life. 
</P>
<P>
"But my role on this team is as the defensive stopper and to put a little 
points on the board and that's what I did. I enjoy playing defense." 
</P>
<P>
While UNLV's defense might have been the key, the Rebels' perimeter offense 
came to the fore after Georgia Tech made a run late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's sagging defense took away UNLV's inside game as forward Larry 
Johnson got into foul trouble. But the Rebels picked up their outside game, 
making 10 of 15 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who had 20 points, broke out of a slump by making five of nine 
three-point shots and Greg Anthony made three of four and scored 14 points.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Celebration gives food for thought - William Packer
visits Paris for two exhibitions with very different views on British
painting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
D'outre-Manche, not quite 'Across', as we have it, but 'Beyond the Channel',
with its faint hint at a somewhat greater psychological barrier, is a
fascinating and even shocking exhibition.
Here is no full and scholarly study of its subject and period - British art
up to the time of Queen Victoria - drawn from the wealth of French public
taste and connoisseurship. But, rather, a parade of historic French
attitudes and assumptions upon the art of our fog-shrouded and barbarous
land, that amounts to a confession.
If that wealth is not drawn upon, it is because that wealth is not there.
The French have never bothered to acquire the art of the British school  -
the distinction between the English, the Irish and the Scots is seldom made,
and ecole Anglais usually stands for all - in any substantial or
comprehensive fashion, for they have never taken our visual culture
seriously. And what they do not take seriously, they do not choose to
understand.
The contrast between our own National Gallery and the Louvre in generosity
of interest and critical even-handedness, could hardly be greater.
In Trafalgar Square we find an account of the post-Renaissance European
tradition that gives each national school its due, the French along with the
Italian, the Spanish, the Dutch and, yes, the British. What gaps there are,
as in the German and northern schools, they are admitted and, as far as
limited resources allow, addressed.
Never so, it would seem, along the quai du Louvre. 'How did I find the
show?' asked my friend in the Louvre's service presse, a little anxiously,
and gave at once her own pre-emptive answer: 'il y a beaucoup des trous.'
The show does contain some lovely things, with the magnificent Gainsborough
full-length of Lady Alston, green silk and grey shawl against a darkly
romantic setting, the best of all.
There are some good Reynolds, a decent Stubbs of Lord Curzon and his horse,
the splendid 'Captain Hay of Spott' by Raeburn and any number of Lawrences -
Lawrence after all was the painter of Europe's grandees in the
post-Napoleonic dispensation and was for a generation the best-known English
painter of them all.
But we know, and at heart the French know, that there is more to the British
School than the brief flourish of the late-Georgian swagger portrait.
So where do we begin? Neither with Holbein nor yet with Van Dyck, for they
are foreigners, so a fine full-length of Edward VI by William Scrots, a
Dutchman, will do.
What then of the Elizabethan miniaturists, Hilliard perhaps? But there is,
it seems, no Hilliard in France, and a single, exquisite portrait of the
fated Earl of Essex by Isaac Oliver, a Frenchman, must do. Into the 17th
century we go, and to the Cavaliers and the Restoration, so with no Van
Dyck, what about Dobson? No Dobson, but a little later there is Lely. Wasn't
he a foreigner, too?
Never mind. The 18th century will sort things out. Philippe Mercier and
Heinrich Fussli (Fuseli to us) are in, I see. Odd that. But we shall really
get going with Hogarth, shan't we, surely the first great painter of the
truly English school. Shan't we?
But the French, we find, have this funny idea that Hogarth wasn't really a
painter at all, but an engraver - and indeed this show reveals the curious
fixed idea that it was in the general commercial development of print-making
that our peculiarly English talents were declared.
So there is not a single Hogarth painting in the show, but only the engraved
version of the 'Marriage a la Mode'. Thomas Girtin is represented by a
single acquatint of the 'Porte Saint Denis', Rowlandson by three satirical
etchings among a group by Gillray and Cruikshank. That group is at least
included, bitterly anti-French as its satires are.
What else? A few good water-colours by Bonington, Constable, Boys and Cox,
miscellaneous drawings, some good oils including a Bonington 'Doges'
Palace', Constable's 'Weymouth Bay' and 'Helmingham Dell', and a late
unfinished Turner landscape, vaporous and magical.
And that, of any substance, is it. This is, indeed, a show which gives us
rather more to think about than actually to see.
The smaller show at the Musee Carnavalet is a wonderful corrective, if only
because the prejudice is openly celebrated in terms that are often as hugely
enjoyable as they are grotesque.
A run of post-Napoleonic jokes about French girls finding any excuse to peer
up the kilts of Scottish soldiers gets us off to a good start and there is
no looking back, or down.
Randy rost-bifs and their prim, boot-faced wives on the one hand, seductive
girls and effete 'frogs' on the other, the ancient mutual stereotypes are
funny still.
But jokes apart, the show does make the serious point that the English love
affair with France had its cultural aspect, and bore real fruit in the work
of our tourist painters. Thus represented here are not only the better-known
figures of Turner, Cox, Bonington, Girtin and Boys, but also such
comparatively minor, but still accomplished, artists as Holland, Wyld,
Callow, Chalon . . . and we think on to Whistler, Sickert, Nicholson . . .
France to us, and Paris above all, has always been irresistible.
D'outre-Manche - British art in French public collections: Musee du Louvre,
Paris 1e, until December 19. Les Anglais a Paris au 19e siecle: Musee
Carnavalet, Paris 4e, until December 11.

<TEXT>     Mr. Scott, who was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., had his boutique in Milan,
Italy, and in the 1960s and early '70s was one of the best-known designers in
that country.;    He had a flair with fabrics, and his flowered print suits
for both men and women were often the rage.;    At times, some of his typical
color schemes included dresses in lemon yellow, pumpkin, hot pink and pepper
green or mauve, purple, chalk white, electric pink and black.;    At other
times, his models swirled down the runways wearing flower-print jersey in
every shade of pink imaginable, from begonia, bougainvillea and poinsettia to
lobster, raspberry, strawberry and watermelon. He also inspired flowered
turtlenecks with velvet dinner suits.;    "Ken was doing psychedelic colorings
before anyone even knew what psychedelic was all about," a Manhattan fashion
illustrator said in a 1968 interview in Time magazine. "Nobody dares to put
color next to color the way he does.";    Mr. Scott later showed
leopard-printed suits for men and women, and went on to design footwear to go
with some of his creations. His fabrics also became wall coverings and bed
furnishings.;    Scott graduated from the Parsons School of Design in
Manhattan in 1941 and worked as a upholsterer and fabric designer before
moving to Paris in 1947 to be an artist.  </TEXT>

   If Ernest Hemingway _ that aficionado of big
guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were
alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight.
   The object of his disaffection would be ``The Best of Bad
Hemingway'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $7.95), a compilation of
the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway
parodies. The ersatz Ernest contest was sponsored by Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous
Hemingway connection deserves induction into the Publicists' Hall
of Fame.
   Hemingway, who would have been 90 on July 21, was no stranger to
parody. His second novel, ``The Torrents of Spring,'' was a cruel
mimickry of Sherwood Anderson, an early mentor Hemingway thought
was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to
be parodied, Hemingway was hardly a sport.
   ``The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he
said after E.B. White spoofed him with a piece called ``Across the
Street and Into the Grill.'' ``The greater the work of literature,
the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing
on the wall above the urinal.''
   All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns
and short on commas. Among the titles: ``The Snooze of
Kilimanjaro,'' ``In Another Contra,'' ``Hills Like White
Heffalumps,'' ``The Old Man and the Seal,'' ``A Clean Well-Sighted
Ace,'' ``A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and ``A Clean Well-Lighted
Race.''
   When author George Plimpton, who wrote the introduction to the
book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry,
he mentioned Daniel Hardy's ``The Last Good Martini,'' which
mangles more than a half-dozen Hemingway titles in its few short
paragraphs:
   ```Do you want to order dinner?' said Nick. `They still serve
the big two-parted liver.'''
   And later: ```Do you remember George Tell?'
   ```Yes,' said Francis. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by Lee Ewing, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the
oysters.'''
   Plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest
was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named Paul Keye for
Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill in Century City, Calif., near Beverly
Hills.
   The American Harry's was a replica of Harry's Bar in Florence,
Italy. Keye knew Hemingway never went to the Harry's in Florence
but was a devotee of the original Harry's Bar in Venice and often
featured it in his stories.
   His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they
would have to face ``The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on
It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and
had to mention Harry's Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to
Florence for dinner at the other Harry's (lodging was not included).
   The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest
organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year,
with celebrity judges such as Plimpton, novelist Joseph Wambaugh,
science fiction writer Ray Bradbury and Jack Hemingway, the
author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the
winning entry. Harry's decided to end the competition after a
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its
restaurants.
   Plimpton was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries.
   ``It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then
the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from
his office at the Paris Review, of which he is editor.
   In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read
only the best entries.
   ``The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the
author by well-known writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Raymond Chandler and Plimpton himself, whose ``The Snows of
Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of Hemingway's writing
style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility.
   Gary Piepenbrink, who edited the collection for Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided
between those who parodied Hemingway because they loved him and
those who did it because they reviled him.
   Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in
1954, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961.
   ``He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with
somehow,'' said Piepenbrink in a telephone interview from his San
Diego office. ``His stature is not to be challenged. His place is
secure in modern literature.
   ``I don't think the collection diminishes Hemingway,'' said
Piepenbrink, who reveres the author. ``Some of the parodies are
pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer couldn't endure
all these punches.''

   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Anything Goes''
and ``Into the Woods,'' three big musicals, dominated the 1988 Tony
award nominations Monday as each show garnered 10 nominations.
   Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Phantom,'' the story of a deformed
composer and his love for a young soprano, and ``Into the Woods,''
a reworking of several fairy tales by Stephen Sondheim and James
Lapine, will compete for best musical of the 1987-88 Broadway
season against ``Sarafina!'' a South African show about township
high school students, and ``Romance-Romance,'' two one-act musicals
about love.
   The same four musicals were also nominated for best score.
   ``M. Butterfly,'' the story of a love affair between a French
naval officer and a star of the Beijing Opera, topped the
non-musical categories with seven nominations.
   It will compete for best play against ``Joe Turner's Come and
Gone,'' August Wilson's drama about the grandchildren of slaves
coming to terms with the past; David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' a
Hollywood morality tale of two movie producers; and ``A Walk in the
Woods'' by Lee Blessing, a two-character play about American and
Soviet arms control negotiators in Geneva.
   Derek Jacobi, who played the brilliant British mathematican Alan
Turing in ``Breaking the Code,'' was nominated for best actor in a
play. His competition: John Lithgow, of ``M. Butterfly''; Robert
Prosky, the Soviet diplomat in ``A Walk in the Woods''; and Ron
Silver, a sleazy Hollywood producer in ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Lady Macbeth captured a best
actress nomination. She will compete against Joan Allen, a tortured
dancer in Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This,'' and Blythe Danner and
Frances McDormand, who played Blanche Du Bois and Stella Kowalski
in a revival of Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   Patti LuPone, the ebullient Reno Sweeney in the revival of
``Anything Goes'' was nominated for best actress in a musical. Her
competition: Joanna Gleason, the practical baker's wife of ``Into
the Woods''; Judy Kuhn, the love interest in ``Chess''; and Alison
Fraser of ``Romance-Romance.''
   Michael Crawford, the title character in ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' was the favorite to win the award for best actor in a
musical. He faces Scott Bakula of ``Romance-Romance''; David
Carroll, the Russian grandmaster in ``Chess''; and Howard McGillin,
an ambitious young stockbroker in Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes.''
   For the first time in years, more than enough nominees filled
the many categories. Among the people snubbed by the Tony
nominating committee were: Sarah Brightman, the leading lady of
``The Phantom of Opera'' and Lloyd Webber's wife; pop star Madonna,
making her Broadway debut in Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow''; John
Malkovich, the star of ``Burn This,'' which also was ignored;
Bernadette Peters of ``Into the Woods''; Christopher Plummer who
played the title role in ``Macbeth''; and Trevor Nunn who directed
``Chess'' and was last year's big Tony winner with ``Les
Miserables.''
   Besides ``Anything Goes,'' nominated for best revival were ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Dreamgirls'' and ``Cabaret.''
   Three performers in ``Cabaret'' _ opera singer Regina Resnik,
Alyson Reed and Werner Klemperer, best known from TV's ``Hogan's
Heroes'' _ received nominations for featured actress and actor in a
musical.
   The other nominees for featured actress in a musical were Judy
Kaye of ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and Leleti Khumalo of
``Sarafina!'' Klemperer faces Robert Westenberg of ``Into the
Woods'' and two actors from ``Anything Goes,'' Bill McCutcheon and
Anthony Heald.
   Harold Prince, the director of ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' was
the top contender for best director of a musical. His competition
is Jerry Zaks, ``Anything Goes''; James Lapine, ``Into the Woods'';
and Mbongeni Ngema, ``Sarafina!''
   The battle for best director of a play pits John Dexter, ``M.
Butterfly''; Gregory Mosher, ``Speed-the-Plow''; Lloyd Richards for
``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' and Clifford Williams, ``Breaking
the Code.''
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' picked up three featured actress
nominations, for Kimberleigh Aarn, L. Scott Caldwell and Kimberly
Scott. Also nominated was Kate Nelligan in the scathing British
satire ``Serious Money.''
   ``Joe Turner'' got one nomination for featured actor in a play _
Delroy Lindo. The other nominees are Michael Gough, ``Breaking the
Code''; Lou Liberatore, ``Burn This''; and B.D. Wong of ``M.
Butterfly.''
   The winners, selected by some 730 members connected to the
theatrical industry, will be announced June 5 in a nationally
televised show on CBS. The Tonys are named for actress-director
Antoinette Perry, who was active in the American Theater Wing
during the 1940s.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: BISHOP MONTGOMERY LOSES 11 PLAYERS -- BUT NOT SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As athletic director of Bishop Montgomery High, Steve Carroll does a good job 
of promoting the school's attractive features. He speaks of the rigorous 
academic environment, the emphasis on discipline and the well-rounded sports 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, he has fought an uphill battle on the athletic front. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, Bishop Montgomery's weight room has been 
burglarized of at least $6,000 in equipment, 11 projected football starters 
have transferred and the basketball coach has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some problems, without a doubt," Carroll said. "But I think our 
reputation speaks for itself. If a kid wants to get the best education he can 
and the best things athletically, he'll consider our school." 
</P>
<P>
But how will the school's recent problems affect athletics? 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery, struggling to stay afloat in the competitive waters of the 
Angelus League, suffered its latest setback Monday when basketball Coach Tony 
Carter resigned after one season. His replacement will become the sixth 
basketball coach at the school in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll hopes to find a new coach within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the losses incurred by the football team may be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Since Carroll was named football coach earlier this year, the Knights have lost 
11 projected starters to other schools. Included in that group are three who 
now attend Banning, most notably All-Angelus League wide receiver Sheldon 
Butler and quarterback Marty Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Joe Dominguez says Butler, a junior, has a good chance of 
starting for the Pilots next season and Garcia, a sophomore, will probably back 
up returning All-Pacific League quarterback John Ma'ae. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, those are major losses for Bishop Montgomery, which has never 
qualified for the CIF-Southern Section playoffs from the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dwelling on the losses, however, Carroll is determined to win with 
the remaining players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken our lumps, but the kids we have now are fantastic," he said. "I 
don't know if we're going to win the league title, but we're going to have a 
successful year one way or another. The kids are hard workers." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll says the players who transferred left for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost (some) kids to academics, four or five to discipline problems and 
three or four because they have moved on to what they think are greener 
pastures," said the native Texan. "I was brought up in another age, I never 
thought about transferring schools. Down around here, it's rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid doesn't like the school or the coach, he can decide he wants to go 
somewhere else. I'm not in favor of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Carroll, who succeeded Andy Szabatura as football coach after last 
season, alienated some players by implementing mandatory weightlifting for all 
levels. Carroll said mandatory lifting was limited to varsity players in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I did catch a few people off guard," he said. "You might lose a few kids 
in the beginning, but everybody seems to know the rules from then on and you 
don't have any more problems." 
</P>
<P>
For Carroll, that would be a welcomed change. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who coached Bishop Montgomery's basketball team to a 9-13 record last 
season, said he resigned because of financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing negative about the job except the pay," he said. "I liked 
the administration and the faculty. I thought the basketball program would get 
better every year. I liked all the kids in the program." 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who has coached basketball for 10 years, including stints as an 
assistant at Cal State Dominguez Hills and Torrance High, said he is going into 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I wanted a little more financial security," he said. 
"There's not much security in coaching. I just wanted something that was more 
lucrative and has more conventional-type hours." 
</P>
<P>
Under Carter, the Knights opened the season with a 9-4 record but went 0-8 in 
the tough Angelus League, losing six games by six points or less. The team 
returns several key players, including all-league junior guard Darryl Daniels, 
who led the Knights with an 18-point scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he has recommended a few coaching candidates that he hopes the 
Bishop Montgomery administration will consider. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they hire somebody I recommended because they would keep my same 
(assistant) coaches and have the same coaching philosophy. All four levels ran 
the same offense and defense last year. It's important to have continuity if 
you want to establish a winning program." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the school is accepting applications for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Carter's recommendations) are something we are considering," he said. "But 
we're not going to sacrifice for consistency. We're going to hire the best guy 
we can get." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, the Banning football coach, lost perhaps the best player in his 
program last February when All-L.A. City fullback Derek Sparks transferred to 
Montclair Prep in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dominguez isn't worried about replacing the talented sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
He says Travis Davis, a 6-foot, 185-pound sophomore with excellent speed, could 
be the next great Banning running back. Davis played defensive back for the 
Pilots last season and is perhaps best remembered for running down Carson 
wingback Larry Billoups, the Colts' fastest player, in the L.A. City 4-A 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's really going to be something," Dominguez said of Davis. "I 
wouldn't be surprised if he runs for 1,100 or 1,200 yards next year." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher Tyrone Scott, a fourth-round draft choice of the Houston 
Astros, signed last week and will report to the Astros' rookie league affiliate 
in Florida on June 23, the day after his graduation. Terms of Scott's contract 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside junior Lisa Leslie was the only high school player selected to the 
U.S. Junior National women's basketball team last week during tryouts in 
Colorado Springs. The 6-foot-5 Leslie begins practice July 5 before leaving on 
a tour that will take the team to New York, Spain and France. 
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Pride II Departs On Maiden Voyage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The clipper schooner Pride of Baltimore II
departed on its maiden voyage Sunday, more than two years after the
original Pride sank in a sudden storm, killing four crew members.
   Like its predecessor, the vessel is modeled after those that
sailed the Chesapeake Bay in the 19th century and will visit other
cities and foreign countries as Maryland's and Baltimore's goodwill
ambassador.
   In order to meet U.S. Coast Guard safety requirements for
carrying passengers, Pride II is almost one-third larger than the
original Pride and 64 tons heavier. Unlike the first Pride, it is
equipped with a second diesel motor, separate compartments for its
12 crew members, and a modern kitchen.
   At Capt. Jan Miles' order, the crew hoisted a replica of the
15-star, 15-stripe U.S. flag that is believed to have flown over
nearby Fort McHenry during the War of 1812; the flag that tradition
holds was still flying and inspired Francis Scott Key to pen the
national anthem.
   The U.S. flag was quickly joined by the flags of Maryland and
Baltimore and a Pride of Baltimore II pennant.
   A shot was fired from a replica of a 19th century cannon on the
starboard side, and the clipper schooner pulled away. It sailed
around the harbor with all five sails unfurled as thousands of
people watched from the shore. A small armada of about 50 private
boats followed the vessel for about an hour until it sailed past
Fort McHenry and under the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
   Before it returns to Baltimore April 21, the clipper schooner is
scheduled to travel to Bermuda; Houston and Galveston, Texas; New
Orleans; Mobile, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.; Puerto Rico, Venezuela,
Colombia, Miami, Jacksonville, Fla.; Savannah, Ga.; North and South
Carolina; and Norfolk, Va.
   It was built with $4 million in donations and government money.
   The vessel was christened April 30, in memory of the captain and
three crew members who died when the Pride sank May 14, 1986, when
a sudden squall blew up 90 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico. The
eight survivors clung to a life raft for five days, rationed to a
bite of biscuit and a half cup of water daily.
   None of the original crew sailed with the Pride II on Sunday.

LAKERS ARE NO LONGER HOME FREE; 
</P>
<P>
FORUM STREAK ENDS AT 17 AS NEW YORK WINS, 122-117 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretensions of perfection at the Forum, which seemed a reasonable enough goal 
for the Lakers until now, went down in a hail of turnovers, failed shot 
attempts and defensive lapses in the final frenzied minutes Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Magic Johnson's final, futile 3-point attempt clanged off the 
back of the rim, the New York Knicks, those long-distance specialists from the 
East, ended the Lakers' 17-game home winning streak with a 122-117 victory 
before a sellout crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
There was a certain symmetry, it seemed, to this one. In November, the Lakers 
handed the Knicks what has turned out to be their only home loss. Now, the 
Lakers also are no longer invincible at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, their only loss at home is to us, and our only loss at home is to them," 
said Johnson, who recorded his ninth triple-double of the season with 26 
points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Knick players talked of revenge after the Lakers beat them at Madison Square 
Garden. And after becoming the first team to beat the Lakers at home this 
season, the Atlantic Division leaders said it might prove important in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We proved we could stay with them on their home court," said Knick forward 
Gerald Wilkins, who scored 10 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter and had an 
important steal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"That could mean a lot should we face them somewhere down the line in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
To that, Johnson shrugged and said the Knicks are capable of being in such a 
playoff position. But Johnson also has heard such motivational talk from many 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's after you," Johnson said. "It goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
It took a little more than 44 minutes, but the Knicks finally invaded the 
Lakers' inner sanctum and took a 114-113 lead on Patrick Ewing's 2 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The teams exchanged baskets for the next few possessions before Laker turnovers 
and missed shots were converted by the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks holding a 116-115 lead and the Lakers in possession, guard 
Byron Scott passed where no Laker was near the ball, Mychal Thompson leaving 
the area for a backdoor cut to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks took full advantage. Mark Jackson made 2 free throws, giving New 
York a 118-115 lead. But after Johnson's inside basket brought the Lakers 
within 1 again, Wilkins continued his fourth-quarter assault. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball at the top of the key, Wilkins faked Scott to the left, then 
drove right for an easy layup. The basket put the Knicks ahead, 120-117, with 
2:07 to play. The score remained that way until there were 4 seconds left, when 
Charles Oakley made 2 free throws. In the more than 2 minutes between, the 
Lakers looked like the inexperienced team and the Knicks the reliable veterans. 
After handling New York's trapping defense most of the game, getting easy 
layups after breaking the press, the Lakers broke down when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had the ball with 54 seconds left, when Coach Pat Riley called a 
timeout. When play resumed, the Lakers isolated Johnson, with the ball, and 
James Worthy was posting low with Wilkins draped all over him. Johnson passed 
once to Worthy, who quickly returned it. But when Johnson tried to repeat the 
sequence, Wilkins had slipped around Worthy and intercepted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the Lakers would get another chance to tie, after the 
Knicks' Trent Tucker missed an outside shot with 28 seconds remaining. But 
Johnson missed a 3-point shot, the rebound deflecting off 2 Knick players and 
out of bounds. It was Laker ball with 17 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying for a 3-pointer, the Lakers this time went inside to 
Thompson, who missed an uncontested shot. The ball was batted out to Johnson, 
standing alone just beyond the 3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's shot was long, and Worthy fouled Oakley while going for the 
rebound. Oakley made both free throws to close out the Knicks' win. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers lost despite shooting 54.5% (to the Knicks' 53.3%), outrebounding 
the Knicks, 39-35, and outplaying them for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' downfall came at the end, when they simply could not handle the 
Knicks' pressure. New York Coach Rick Pitino said the Knicks wore out the 
Lakers, but Riley said fatigue was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many mental mistakes down the stretch," said Riley, whose team 
also got 26 points from Worthy and 21 from A.C. Green. "We made 2 or 3 
turnovers in the last 2 minutes, and you can't expect to win when you do that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ahead 80% of the time, but we made some defensive mistakes, and Gerald 
Wilkins got off on us. Byron threw one away, and James and Buck (Johnson) 
couldn't get together on that pass in the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was fatigue. I think we played well enough to win most of the 
time. But unless you do it all the time, you can't beat a team like the 
Knicks." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pitino: "The Lakers played as well or better against our press than any 
team has all season. I told our players at the half that fatigue would be the 
key factor in the second half, and the team that had the best legs would win. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they gave everything in the first half, and we knew our best was yet 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored 25 points, and Oakley got 23 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks weren't too bad in the first half, either. They never led, but that 
did not mean they played poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded with surges that enabled 
them to take a 69-63 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' biggest first-half lead was 10 points late in the first quarter, 
when Thompson completed a fast break with a dunk. Thompson hung onto the rim 
for a moment before crashing to the floor. His feet out in front of him, 
Thompson landed squarely on his back and remained there until play could be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed in the lineup, and the Lakers held the lead, although the Knicks cut 
it to 4 by the end of the quarter, mainly on long-range shooting. New York 
outscored the Lakers, 10-4, in the final 2 minutes of the period, led by 
Jackson with 2 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks pulled within a point of the Lakers five times midway through the 
second quarter. But each time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded, 
Green and Worthy leading the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Knicks' best chance gone awry came after Green made only 1 free 
throw to give the Lakers a 57-55 lead with 3:40 to play in the first half. But 
Jackson missed an open jumper, and then the Knicks were called for their second 
illegal defense violation in the half, resulting in a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made the technical, then Thompson rebounded a missed shot and scored 
inside for a 60-55 Laker lead. Oakley, arguing that a foul should have been 
called, was given a technical foul. Johnson then made another technical for a 
6-point Laker lead. 
</P>
<P>
After a Knick turnover, Johnson scored on a fast-break layup to increase the 
lead to 8. 
</P>
<P>
But with a team saturated with 3-point shooters and strong inside players such 
as Ewing and Oakley, the Knicks could not be counted out, even after the Lakers 
extended the lead to 99-91 entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have played better down the stretch," Johnson said. "It was mental 
mistakes. They did a great job. They have the best trap in the league. And in 
the fourth quarter, we just didn't attack it." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Lakers' quest for a 41-0 record at the Forum ended in home game number 
18. Perhaps it had just been wishful thinking all along, because they didn't 
seem crushed to see it end. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's history," Riley said. "I don't want to dismiss it, but it's over."

<P>
I have received a complimentary copy of a magazine called Heads Up, a 
publication of the Beer Drinkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
If all the beer drinkers in America are members of that organization, it must 
be very large indeed, and very powerful politically. It is more likely, I 
suspect, that its members are in the brewing industry. 
</P>
<P>
I do not qualify, by habit, for membership (I generally drink wine), but I am 
amused by the industry's pretensions to patriotism. The cover shows three men 
in Colonial costume examining a document written on parchment. They are in a 
tavern before a great fireplace. Their table holds two full beer mugs and one 
lighted candle. In the table of contents it is noted that this scene was 
"re-created" in Gulliver's restaurant in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
I am always glad to learn some previously unknown tidbit of American history, 
so I was surprised but not displeased to learn in an article called "Ye Old 
Public Taverns Were a Source of Inspiration, Warmth . . . and American Liberty" 
that Thomas Jefferson actually wrote one of his drafts of the Declaration of 
Independence in a tavern. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he in a tavern, he was drinking ale. I quote: 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Jefferson sat at the Indian Queen Tavern in Philadelphia facing a blank 
sheet of parchment. Taking a long drink of his freshly poured ale, he touched 
his pen to paper and scratched, 'When in the course of human events . . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
It is fascinating to think that Jefferson may have been a little tipsy when he 
wrote that most cherished of American documents. Perhaps the ale accounts for 
his misspelling of "inalienable" as "unalienable," an error that has been 
perpetuated in copies of the declaration to the present day. It is said that 
Jefferson in his other writings spelled the word "inalienable." 
</P>
<P>
We may also wonder whether it was the ale, and the tavern setting, that caused 
Jefferson to omit women from his phrase, "We hold these truths to be 
self-evident; that all men are created equal. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In his biography, "Jefferson the Virginian," Dumas Malone notes that in his 
original draft Jefferson had written "We hold these truths to be sacred and 
undeniable," but this rhetorical flare-up was toned down later, either by 
Jefferson himself or by Benjamin Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, though Jefferson may have been under the influence of ale when he 
composed it, his declaration has stood the test of time. As Malone says, "No 
other American document has been read so often or listened to by so many weary 
and perspiring audiences. Yet, despite interminable repetition, those well-worn 
phrases have never lost their potency and charm." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a close second to the declaration would be Lincoln's "Gettysburg 
Address," which he wrote on one sheet of paper before leaving the White House 
for the cemetery. He made some revisions the night before the talk. Oddly, the 
phrase "under God," in "this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom," did not appear in his original copies. He ad libbed them. But they 
appear in all subsequent copies. One thing I doubt seriously, is that Lincoln 
had drunk any beer or spiritous liquor while he was composing it. 
</P>
<P>
Heads Up also notes that the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The 
Star-Spangled Banner" in 1814 was sewn by Mary Young Pickersgill on the floor 
of a Baltimore brewery. 
</P>
<P>
In an article on "America's No. 1 Song" (Atlantic, July, 1986) Daniel Mark 
Epstein explains that Mary's sewing room was too small for the flag, which was 
30 feet high and 42 feet wide, so she and her little daughter worked on their 
hands and knees on the malt-house floor of Claggett's Brewery. They finished 
just as the British fleet was approaching Baltimore Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Key was a prisoner of the British during that night of rockets red glare and 
bombs bursting in air, and at dawn, when he saw the flag still flying, he wrote 
his poem on an envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the flag sewn on a brewery floor, but the poem was set to the tune 
of an English drinking song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," a hymn to the ancient 
Greek poet Anacreon, who loved wine and lovemaking above all else. London 
gentlemen spent nights of alcoholic singing and revelry in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heads Up, Key's words were published on a handbill the next day 
and were soon "being sung in Baltimore taverns." 
</P>
<P>
So "The Star-Spangled Banner" is a dubious national anthem, not only because of 
its libertine origin, but also because of its notoriously out-of-reach high 
notes and low notes, on which the best voices -- pop, operatic and rock -- 
routinely founder; also, it can not be marched to. 
</P>
<P>
I don't drink beer when I write. If I did, I'd probably write phrases like "We 
hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable."

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SLUGGER HAS POP IN HIS BAT, SPEED TO BOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The name is the same, and so is the game. But that is where the similarities 
end. George Scott III, who plays outfield for Cal State Dominguez Hills, is 
indeed the son of George Scott, the one-time American League home run champion 
who hit 271 homers during a 14-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
When his dad played he was known as the Boomer because he weighed 225 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Scott, a trimmed-down version of his dad, was a track standout in 
high school who didn't begin playing baseball until his senior year. He has a 
sprinter's speed and is vying for the Toros' lead in stolen bases. "We list him 
at 180 pounds but he's probably closer to 165," said a school official. He's 
known to teammates as the Baby Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott grew up in Massachusetts while his father gained fame with the Boston Red 
Sox. After playing at New Bedford High in the Boston area, he attended 
Miami-Dade's community college, where he stole 53 bases in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
His parents divorced and his mother, Malvine, became engaged to an employee at 
Dominguez Hills. Scott followed last summer and showed up as a walk-on for 
baseball, a pleasant surprise for Coach George Wing. 
</P>
<P>
Wing described Scott as "electrifying . . . George's speed is an intimidating 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Scott agrees that speed is his game. "My dad is a power hitter," he said. "He's 
a home-run hitter and an RBI man. I'm a leadoff batter and known more for my 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
But Scott had a power-hitter's swing when he arrived at Dominguez Hills, a 
problem Wing has tried to correct. The work to shorten his swing is paying 
dividends, as Scott is hitting .349, has a team-high 52 hits and has stolen 14 
bases, one behind team leader Robert Campbell. Thirteen of Scott's 22 RBIs have 
come with two outs. The Toros are 13-19 going into tonight's game at Cal State 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wing has also worked with Scott, a right-hand batter, on switch-hitting. He 
hasn't tried it in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is making a name for himself in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
and, he hopes, beyond. If he follows his father's footsteps, it will be done 
with speed, not strength. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount basketball standout Bo Kimble made a strong showing at the 
Orlando Classic, an all-star series in Florida last week showcasing college 
seniors for pro scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble was named to the all-tournament team after leading in steals. He also 
got a chance to play point guard in a practice to show he is comfortable in a 
set-up game, which Loyola has rarely played. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to show scouts a universal game, everything but offense," Kimble 
said. "I didn't concentrate on scoring at all. I think I surprised some scouts, 
that I can play good halfcourt man-to-man defense. They never had a chance to 
see me play that way." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble managed to rank among the top scorers, leading the West team in two of 
three games. He played with a sprained left thumb suffered in the semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who led the nation in scoring with a 35.7-point average and had an 
outstanding NCAA tournament, didn't need to play in the all-star series. But 
Kimble and his agent, David Spencer, thought it would enhance his standing for 
the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I guaranteed myself a lottery pick," Kimble said. "I moved up in the 
draft. It worked out to my best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who recruited Kimble out of high school for USC, said: "I don't think 
there's any question he helped himself. It was a chance for people to see him 
in a more normal-type game than a Loyola game. One (NBA) general manager told 
me, 'You've got the best guy here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Musician P.R. Paul, a fan of Loyola basketball, has written a song called 
"Hank's House" as a tribute to the late Hank Gathers. The folk-style song is 
available on cassette by mail as a fund-raiser for the Hank Gathers Memorial 
Fund that was established by the school. 
</P>
<P>
The tape is available for $4.75 from: Hank's House, P.O. Box 83413, Los Angeles 
90083. Paul said all money will go to the Gathers fund. 
</P>
<P>
Former El Camino College and University of Nevada-Las Vegas soccer standout Dom 
Militello got his pro career off to a good start on Friday the 13th. Playing in 
the Salt Lake City Sting's opening game, the Palos Verdes native scored three 
goals in a 3-1 victory over the New Mexico Chiles. The Sting plays in the 
American Pro Soccer League, which includes the South Bay-based L.A. Heat. 
Militello, who was the South Coast Conference player of the year and a 
community college All-American at El Camino, recently graduated from UNLV, 
where he helped the Rebels win a Big West Conference championship and qualify 
for the NCAA playoffs for two consecutive seasons. Militello will play locally 
on July 13 when the Sting visits the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Some former Dominguez Hills players also made their debut in the league last 
week. Joe Flanagan is playing for the Heat, Chris Wilson and Lucky Temisanren 
for the California Emperors, who play at University of Redlands, and Glen 
Strachan for the San Diego Nomads. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the week: The Loyola men's programs are at an all-time best. Last week, 
the basketball team was ranked eighth in the final poll, the baseball team was 
ranked ninth and the volleyball team was ranked eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola outfielder Tony Kounas was named West Coast Conference baseball player 
of the week after hitting three home runs in a game at San Francisco and 
knocking in nine runs in a three-game sweep of the University of San Francisco. 
. . . Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai signed two players, 
trying to improve the Toros' inside game. Albert Kiilehua, a 6-foot-7 graduate 
of Leuzinger High in 1988, and 6-8 Alex del Hierro of Bell High, will join two 
redshirt Division I transfers, guard Keith Billingslea from Northern Arizona 
and Harbor College and swingman Brian Jones of Cal State Long Beach. . . . 
Dominguez Hills softball players Jennifer Boen and Melissa Punch are battling 
for the team leadin batting. Boen started the week at .387 and Punch was at 
.383. Punch has a team-high 22 RBIs, two ahead of Maria Romero.

MATER DEI'S NO. 1 AGAIN; ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, the Mater Dei High School baseball team won 21 games with a 
talented outfield of Mike Basse, Larry Sutton and Jim Austin, all of whom 
signed with Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mater Dei won 22 games with an equally talented pitching staff that 
featured Tony Pena (12-1) and Scott Corliss (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
This season, Mater Dei should continue its winning ways with a stellar infield 
that Coach Bob Ickes thinks could be comparable to his previous outfield and 
pitching stars. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which finished second in the county poll the past two seasons, is 
the top-ranked team in The Times' preseason baseball poll. 
</P>
<P>
1. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Lionel Hastings, a gifted hitter with a strong arm, is the catalyst 
of the infield. Hastings has made an oral commitment to USC and Ickes thinks he 
will start for the Trojans as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Jim McCarthy, sidelined with injuries the past two years, finally 
gets his chance to play. Doug DeJardin starts at second base and Ryan Andersen 
is at third. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all Division I prospects," Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, 6-2 with losses to Capistrano Valley and Irvine, is batting .350 as 
a team. In the recent Newport-Tustin tournament, Mater Dei scored 23 runs in 
the championship game against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"Year in and year out, we're going to score runs," Ickes said. "But we've never 
been questionable on the mound. We don't have a No. 1 on the mound, they're all 
equal. We're just hoping for consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, the county's player of the year in 1989, is now at Arizona State. Three 
starters -- Jason Deitrick, Colin Gawlonski and Sean Sutton -- are vying for 
the top spot in the Mater Dei rotation. Mike Ferletic is the team's top relief 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used eight pitchers," Ickes said. "We knew going into the season we were 
undermanned, but our depth could confuse some teams if we use the right pitcher 
in the right situation." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an inexperienced pitching staff, Ickes likes his team's chances 
</P>
<P>
"We had the same question marks in 1980 with our pitching staff, and we went 
all the way (won the 4-A title) that year," he said. "You just never know." 
</P>
<P>
2. OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
A trio of talented left-handed pitchers -- Randy Karliner, Jim Gwaltney and 
Eric Schaff -- gives Ocean View one of the best starting rotations in the 
county. Karliner won eight of 11 games as a sophomore and was a first-team 
all-league selection last year. Schaff was injured most of last season but is 
one of the most improved players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Daniel Hernandez batted .378 and was a Times' all-county selection as 
a junior last year. Few can match Hernandez's defensive skills in the infield 
and he is expected to attract a lot of attention from major league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Barrett thinks Scott Caringella is the best outfielder in the 
Sunset League. "Pitching, pitching and more pitching will be our strength," 
Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View was the runner-up in the 32-team Loara tournament last week, losing 
to nationally ranked Lakewood, 9-3, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
3. KATELLA 
</P>
<P>
Returning all-league third baseman Dennis Briggs and shortstop Jamie Vitzelio 
give Katella a solid infield. Katella scored seven runs on three home runs to 
beat Servite in the third-place game of the Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from our No. 1 to No. 9 batter is hitting the ball," said Tim 
McMenamin, Katella's coach. Katella has a .375 team batting average in 
preseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs is batting .647 with 11 hits in 17 at-bats in five games and newcomer 
Eric Boyd has been a pleasant surprise in the outfield, batting .562. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Allen, formerly Danny Kirker, is the team's top pitcher. Allen allowed 
only two earned runs in Katella's only loss to Ocean View. Catcher Jess Evans 
has made a successful transition from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
4. SERVITE 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen returning varsity players, including seven starters, should help 
Servite turn around a mediocre 1989 season in which the Friars finished 
11-12-1. Cliff Mierendorf anchors a solid pitching staff. Shortstop Ed Crippin 
and first baseman Rob Walker are among the team's top hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Crippin batted .362 and had 11 stolen bases last season and Walker, the team's 
best power hitter, batted .464 with eight doubles. Catcher Ryan Boucher is one 
of the top defensive players in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We will produce runs with power and a good bench," said Mike McNary, Servite's 
coach. "We have high hopes for a turnaround season with every starter having at 
least one year of varsity experience. We could battle Mater Dei for the Angelus 
League championship." 
</P>
<P>
Servite will play at Mater Dei Saturday in the league opener. 
</P>
<P>
5. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers shared the Sea View League title with Estancia last year and 
advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. This should be another banner 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Two-year starter Dan Baker, who struck out 100 batters in 74 innings last year, 
has opened with victories over Esperanza and Mission Viejo in 1990. Two juniors 
-- outfielder Shawn Green and shortstop Ben Munoz -- are the Tillers' top 
hitters. Green is batting over .500 in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin scored 54 runs in four games in the Irvine tournament and was held to 
less than 10 runs in only two games all summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're swinging the bat pretty well," said Vince Brown, who has been head coach 
at Tustin for the past five seasons. "The team is batting over .350 and I have 
three players hitting over .450. I think we have the makings of the best team 
since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
6. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Consistently one of the county's top programs, Edison slumped to a 9-13-2 
record in 1989 after injuries to its top two pitchers. Jim Futami tore an arm 
muscle in Edison's fifth league game but returns healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Steve Thobe, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound senior, has hit three home runs in 
six games and has a fine arm. Shortstop James Eidam and second baseman Rocky 
Balch return. 
</P>
<P>
Three stars on Edison's football team -- Donnie Smith, Brian Higgins and Chad 
Ponegalek -- also will play key roles. Ponegalek is the team's leadoff hitter 
and has good speed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good pitching, speed and contact hitters," said Paul Harrell, Edison 
coach. "After last year, the key will be trying to keep our pitchers healthy." 
</P>
<P>
7. LOARA 
</P>
<P>
After losing eight of their first 11, Loara was the surprise winner of the 
Empire League last year. Joey Gaudio is the ace of a solid pitching staff and 
also plays the outfield. He won four games and batted .367 last year. Catcher 
Chris Hoffman is the team's best player, coming off a junior year in which he 
batted .333 and struck out only four times. 
</P>
<P>
"We have eight returners with valuable experience and four quality pitchers," 
said Rob Megill, Loara's coach. "As our pitching goes, we will go." 
</P>
<P>
8. LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
All-county quarterback Todd Gragnano is equally impressive throwing a baseball, 
and along with outfielder Tony Napolitano, gives Los Alamitos a strong team. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano won four games as a junior and batted .318. Another football standout, 
Brian Havens, returns after batting .370 with 19 RBIs as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano is one of the premier players in the county. Last season, he batted 
.427 with six home runs and 26 RBIs. "Hitting will be our strength," Los 
Alamitos Coach Mike Gibson said. "We don't have much team speed and our 
pitching is a big question mark after Gragnano." 
</P>
<P>
9. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Four starters who combined to win 15 games give El Toro one of the best 
pitching staffs in the county. Rob Johnson won eight games; Brad Hulse won 
three games, and Greg Pearce and Ryan Filbeck each won two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching should keep us in all games . . . hopefully the experience will pay 
off," El Toro Coach Dan DeLeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Bo Haley, a three-year starter, is a Division I prospect and among 
the county's best players. Shortstop Chris Sauritch and third baseman Scott 
Sebbo both have good power. 
</P>
<P>
10. EL DORADO 
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to be a rebuilding for El Dorado, which won the Southern Section 
5-A division title last year. Every starter graduated from last year's team 
that finished 23-8, but Coach Steve Gullotti has a good group of sophomores and 
juniors who were the nucleus of the junior varsity team that finished 19-6 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Andy Brazeel has won four games going into Friday's league opener with 
Esperanza. El Dorado had no problems scoring runs in the Loara tournament last 
week, getting 11 runs in the first inning in a 16-2 victory over Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be strong defensively and have more-than-adequate offense," Gullotti 
said. "We will need two or three pitchers to emerge if we expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Others teams to watch: Anaheim, Capistrano Valley, Esperanza, Estancia, 
Fountain Valley, Mission Viejo, Pacifica, Santa Ana, Sunny Hills and Trabuco 
Hills.

<TEXT>
   Archaeologists searching Fort McHenry for
underground drainage conduits have stumbled upon a long trench
presumably used by infantrymen the night the British attacked
Baltimore in 1814.
   The bombardment of Fort McHenry inspired Francis Scott Key to
write the poem ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' later adopted as the
national anthem.
   The trench, originally about three feet deep, is about seven feet
below today's surface level and is more than 100 feet long. It
contained a pewter infantryman's button the size of a nickel and a
10-pound fragment of a British cannon ball.
   ``At first, the trench was very puzzling. ... But it was the
(infantryman's) button and bomb fragment which linked it with the
War of 1812. The button was of the type worn then, during the late
18th and early 19th centuries,'' said Charles D. Cheek, the
archaeologist in charge of the dig.
   The trench was dug around the fort's western flank, the side
farthest from the harbor and the British fleet. Historians believe
the 600 infantrymen stationed at Fort McHenry could have been
ordered into the trench as a safety measure.
   If the British had landed successfully in the attack on the night
of Sept. 13, 1814, the infantrymen would have been called upon to
defend the city.
   However, the British bombardment of the fort killed only four and
wounded about two dozen. The British were unable to get ashore and
retreated.
   The existence of some sort of old trench was known as early as
1984, when a section was discovered during an earlier dig. The
archaeologists doing the work then were unsure what the depression
was, Cheek said.
   Cheek and six other archaeologists arrived at the fort five weeks
ago under a $105,000 contract from the National Park Service to find
the fort's original drainage conduits. They failed to find all the
drains.
   Park Ranger Paul E. Plamann said the archaeologists were called
in to see if there was an existing drainage system that could be
repaired and reopened because the fort has been troubled with
deterioration of its brickwork for many years.

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Experts likely to eclipse incoming

On July 19, when the new European Parliament elected on June 9 and 12 holds
its inaugural session, Mr Franco Iacono, an Italian Socialist MEP not
standing for re-election, will have more than usual regrets. A tireless
campaigner in the outgoing legislature for mandatory bidets in European
hotels, he may face charges in Naples on corruption allegations once his
parliamentary immunity expires.
The European Parliament hopes the elections will flush away its lesser
talents. It needs a new intake of calibre to project its influence and
exploit the new powers invested in it by the Maastricht treaty.
The new assembly will not lack grandees, but it will not always be the names
best known to voters who hold the real levers of power. And although voters
nationally have entrusted their governments to Socialists in only three of
the 12 EU member states (Spain, Greece and Denmark), everything indicates
that the Union's only directly elected body will be more Socialist-dominated
than ever before.
The leadership of the Socialist group, the largest at Strasbourg, is the
parliament's most influential position. It is expected to go to Mrs Pauline
Green, a tough-minded former policewoman who has commanded effectively the
British Labour contingent.
That UK Labour MEPs, already the largest single national unit and expected
to increase heavily at Tory expense, should aim single-mindedly at the group
leadership rather than the presidency accurately measures how power flows in
the Parliament.
It is the leaders of the political groups - in which Mrs Green would be
prima inter pares - which set the agenda. Her counterpart in what looks set
to be a diminished Christian Democrat bloc is likely to remain Mr Leo
Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister, set to be re-elected alongside
another former Belgian premier, Mr Wilfried Martens.
But the presidency of the parliament, hitherto a politically ill-defined
role trapped somewhere between parliamentary speaker and lacklustre
figurehead, could yet grow in stature. 'The potential for the presidency
becoming the job is growing,' believes Mr David Harley of the assembly's
secretariat-general.
Ms Elisabeth Guigou, former French minister for Europe standing in the
Socialist list, is a figure many insiders reckon has enough clout to give
the parliament an image of respect.
The Socialists also control environment - possibly the single most
influential committee in shaping law - under Labour MEP Mr Ken Collins, who
could face challenge from former EU environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di
Meana from Italy's Greens. They chair too the foreign affairs committee,
under Mr Enrique Baron, a lightweight former president of the parliament
whom some would like to see replaced by Mr Fernando Moran, a former Spanish
socialist foreign minister.
Formal structures aside, it is the preparation for the 1996 review of the
Maastricht treaty, in which parliament will have an important say, that will
define which MEPs rise. A key figure here will be the Scots Labour MEP and
parliament vice-president Mr David Martin, the Socialists' main
constitutional expert.
Mr Martin made a highly regarded submission to the Maastricht treaty
negotiations, and also chairs the 'conciliation' committee which operates
the parliament's new legislative powers in negotiation with the Council of
Ministers.
With these sorts of priorities, many incoming national 'stars' could well be
eclipsed. Mr Bernard Kouchner, flamboyant founder of Medecins sans
Frontieres and former minister for humanitarian affairs in the last French
socialist government, or Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce, former UNHCR
representative in Bosnia, could fade in a body now concentrating more on
issues it can influence than on the human rights gestures it was famous for.
Nor is it clear what role other national figures, like former French
Socialist premier Michel Rocard, or Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the
former Italian Communists, intend to play.
Mr Occhetto, already an MEP, appeared so seldom at Strasbourg that when he
turned up for May's historic enlargement vote to admit four new countries
into the Union, he missed the first two votes on Norway and Austria because
he did not know how to work his voting card.

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Sept. 14, 1814, Francis Scott Key wrote his famous poem ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' after witnessing the British bombardment of
Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812.
   On this date:
   In 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr was acquitted of a
misdemeanor charge two weeks after he was found innocent of treason.
   In 1812, the Russians set fire to Moscow after an invasion by
Napoleon Bonaparte's troops.
   In 1847, U.S. forces under Gen. Winfield Scott took control of

site of the United Nations' world headquarters.
   In 1948, Gerald R. Ford Jr. upset Rep. Bartel J. Jonkman in
Michigan's Fifth District Republican primary.
   In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower met in Newport, R.I.,
with Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, who pledged to uphold court-ordered
school integration, but also pleaded for patience.
   In 1959, the Soviet space probe Luna II became the first manmade
object to reach the moon as it crashed onto the lunar surface.
   In 1963, Mary Ann Fischer of Aberdeen, S.D., gave birth to
America's first surviving quintuplets, four girls and a boy.

spread rumors Seberg had become pregnant by a member of the Black
Panther Party in order to ``neutralize'' her support for black
militants.
   Five years ago: Israel's new coalition government came into
being, with Shimon Peres of the Labor Party as prime minister and

<HEAD>Pilgrims Sailed in the Pinto? Wait a Minute ...</HEAD>

   How's this for revisionist history? The
pilgrims sailed to America in the Pinto. Paul Revere wrote ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' Sandra Day O'Connor is chief justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   And Gen. Douglas MacArthur said, ``Give me liberty or give me
death.'' Or was it Martin Luther King Jr.?
   These are samplings of responses from community-college students
to questions that might be asked of immigrants seeking U.S.
citizenship.
   Just five of 119 students at Bellevue Community College managed
a passing grade of 70 percent or better.
   ``This is pretty bad,'' said Aslam Khan, head of the college's
political science department, who administered the test.
   ``Why should we give these questions to foreigners when our own
citizens don't know what is going on?'' asked the Pakistan-born
Khan, who took such a test when he became a naturalized citizen.
   Less than half the students knew that the supreme law of the
land is the Constitution.
   When asked what kind of government the United States has, many
answered ``capitalist,'' rather than a democracy.
   Some said the pilgrims left Europe because they were searching
for something to colonize, apparently forgetting the religious
persecution that prompted them to flee to the New World.
   A decade ago, Khan gave a similar test of 10 questions to 118
students. Six passed.
   ``It's not getting any better,'' he said.
   It may be good for a few snickers when a student identifies
Abraham Lincoln as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, but when only one student answers 29 of the 30
questions correctly and just 18 get 60 percent right, everybody
should be concerned, Khan said.
   ``I think people should know what is going on in this country,''
he said. ``We really do need a course in remedial American
Government.''
   For the record:
   _ The Pinta, not the Pinto, was one of three ships used by
Christopher Columbus, along with the Nina and the Santa Maria. The
pilgrims sailed in the Mayflower.
   _ Francis Scott Key wrote the national anthem, while Paul Revere
warned American revolutionaries the British were coming.
   _ Ms. O'Connor is the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court,
which has yet to have a woman chief justice.
   _ Patrick Henry preferred death over tyranny in his famous to
the Virginia House of Burgesses, while MacArthur is remembered for
pledging ``I shall return'' to the Philippines and civil-rights
leader King for his ``I have a dream'' speech.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Pride of Lions with an English accent - John Hopkins
saves the British and Irish selectors the trouble of picking a party to tour
New Zealand / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour New
Zealand this summer will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not
bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off.
Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is
easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989. Players from England -
which is vying with New Zealand to be the second-best rugby nation in the
world - obviously should form the core of the party.
Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability. Lions' teams
have been dogged by regional parochialism. Imagine the scene: selectors
representing each of the four home unions gather round the table. As the
composition of the party takes shape, one selector realises that there will
only be a couple of players from his country. This will reflect badly on him
and colours his comments.
Since it is impossible for me to predict these outbursts of chauvinism, I
have ignored them altogether. How nice it would be to think there will be
none and that the best party is chosen.
The new laws have encouraged the up-and-under as an attacking tactic.
Full-backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is
one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb. And while neither is entirely
reliable with the boot (look at Webb against Wasps last Saturday), there
will be other goal-kickers in the party.
Wings? The Underwood brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers.
Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good
vice-captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months
ago. The fourth wing is a toss-up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and
Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more
rounded player who can play full-back as well. Since versatility is an asset
on tour, I prefer Hunter.
Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first-choice
partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should
go. He is a rock-solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to
Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de
Glanville.
Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand-off halves as
Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another. Barnes has an
edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He
demonstrated this brilliantly at Twickenham against Scotland. Andrew is a
doughty competitor and a good goal-kicker. The competition between them will
be keen.
Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum-half. Will the other be
Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or
Robert Jones, the quick-passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance
by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season. Morris is my
choice.
No. 8? A man like Dean Richards is an essential component of a team in New
Zealand where at least some of the games will be played in mud. His
upper-body strength and ability to tie-up the ball will be invaluable. With
training every day, he should get a bit fitter, too.
If, however, the ground is dry and the game is expected to be fast and
loose, then Ben Clarke would be an acceptable choice at No. 8. He could even
play blindside flanker with Richards at the back.
Is Wade Dooley a spent force? I think not. If there are four better line-out
forwards in the home countries, then I am a Dutchman. He will benefit from
regular competition, which he does not get with Preston Grasshoppers.
Martin Bayfield should go along with Martin Johnson, who is known and
respected in New Zealand. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include
Gareth Llewellyn, who has blossomed this season as captain of Neath; Neil
Francis of Ireland; and the Scots, Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin. Francis is
my man.
Kenny Milne and Brian Moore are certainties as the hookers, Jeff Probyn and
Jason Leonard as two of the props. I think that Nick Popplewell, the fiery
Irishman, and Paul Burnell of Scotland, should join them.
Flankers? Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in
the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal
workrate on the open-side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward,
a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so
again this summer. Emyr Lewis was a leading candidate four months ago but
has not played at his best this season. Tim Rodber has come on at
Northampton under the aegis of Wayne Shelford and, like Clarke, could play
either at No 8 or flanker. He deserves a chance.
Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the
captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world
rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely
at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it  - the media and
all that. Hastings manages to do both with less apparent discomfort.
It might be a horrible mistake or it might be a moment of inspired thinking
to make Hastings the captain and give Carling a break from captaincy to
concentrate entirely on his own game. I plump for Hastings.
So there you are Lions' selectors, I have done the job for you in half the
time and at no cost. The party comprises 21 Englishmen, five Scots, two
Welshmen and two Irishmen. I must now duck my Irish and Welsh friends and
colleagues for having picked only two men from their country but I did say I
would select strictly on merit.
Thus the composition of my party is (English unless otherwise stated): G
Hastings, (Scotland) capt, J Webb, R Underwood, T Underwood, I Evans,
(Wales), I Hunter, W Carling, J Guscott, S Gibbs (Wales), S Hastings,
(Scotland) S Barnes, R Andrew, G Armstrong (Scotland), D Morris, J Probyn, J
Leonard, N Popplewell (Ireland), P Burnell (Scotland), B Moore, K Milne
(Scotland), W Dooley, M Bayfield, M Johnson, N Francis (Ireland), P
Winterbottom, N Back, M Teague, T Rodber, B Clarke, D Richards.

<TEXT>     The loss of Morris (11-6) to injury would have left Minnesota at least
temporarily without its top two pitchers. Scott Erickson (12-3) was placed on
the 15-day disabled list July 2.;  CLARK SWINGS TOWARD CAUTION, PASSES UP THE
HOME-RUN DERBY; Will Clark homered on the last two days before the All-Star
break and stood among the National League leaders with 15. So why wasn't the
Giants' first baseman in Monday's home-run derby?;    "They asked me to be in
it, and I said no," Clark said. "It was the first time in the four years I've
been here that they asked me.;    "My swing is finally coming around right
now, and I wanted to stay in a groove.";    Twice this season, Clark has been
injured in rundown plays and forced to take time off. It runs in the family.
Clark said this was his first opportunity to visit his brother, Scott, since
the boy broke an arm playing in a baseball game last month in Louisiana.;   
"Scotty had a rundown, he had a trip and a fall, and then everybody and their
grandma fell on top of him," Clark said.;    "I broke my left wrist when I was
13. I missed a whole year of Babe Ruth because of it.";  Franco says he was
misquoted; The All-Star Game's raging controversy turned into a lovefest
Tuesday.;    As it turns out, Julio Franco did not insist he was better
qualified to start at second base than Roberto Alomar, a remark that had
stirred a hornets' nest in Toronto.;    Franco, in a private meeting before
they dressed for the game, claimed he was misquoted. And Alomar believed him.;
   "Somebody asked me a question," Franco said. "He twisted my words. I said,
'If you can prove I shouldn't start, I'll kiss my own (backside). I didn't say
anything about Roberto Alomar.";    Said Alomar: "We're both Latin. We're too
good of friends to let this stand between us. I wasn't mad at Julio. I just
had to see him in person and talk about it first. We Latins have to stick
together.";    Franco is from the Dominican Republic, Alomar from Puerto
Rico.;  Edge to pitchers,; Sandberg says; There had been only 31 runs scored
in the last seven All-Star Games before Tuesday, dating to the 1984 game at
Candlestick Park. N.L. second baseman Ryne Sandberg played in all of them, and
he gave this theory:;    "In all the games I've been involved in, the pitchers
have dominated. They're giving it all they've got, because they're only going
an inning or two. I'd say the average fastball is about 5 mph faster than
usual.";  Rickey plays coy;  There were about 700 reporters at the game, and
there seemed to be nearly that many who were stiffed by A's outfielder Rickey
Henderson. The All-Star regular usually talks at these things, but he
continues to be taciturn this season.;  Big difference;  The weather was not
the only difference between this game and the last one -- at rainy Wrigley
Field. The N.L. had three hits in the first inning, one more than they had in
the entire 1990 game.;  La Russa knows; fame is fleeting; The A's Tony La
Russa, the A.L. manager, said he has kept track of the Giants' woes and said
he has sympathy for Bay Area counterpart Roger Craig.;    "He's a dedicated
winner," La Russa said. "When he's not doing as good as he'd like to do, he
suffers. I know he's suffered more than any fan has.;    "That's why you
appreciate it any time you have success. It can go away quickly. It also can
appear quickly, maybe even in the second half for him and the Giants."; 
Astros stand out; Why was the Houston contingent wearing white uniforms as
visitors? Don't blame pitcher Pete Harnisch, catcher Craig Biggio or Manager
Art Howe, who was an N.L. coach. It seems the Astros' road uniforms are
off-white, and they stood out during introductions.;  DRY SPELL ENDS; Andre
Dawson's fourth-inning homer off Roger Clemens was the first by an N.L. player
since Dale Murphy hit one in the 1984 game at Candlestick Park. That had been
61 innings and 223 All-Star at-bats ago.;  AN AGING RECORD; With his bloop
single to center in the sixth inning, A.L. catcher Carlton Fisk became the
oldest player to hit safely in an All-Star Game. Ted Williams had been the
oldest, at 41, in 1960. Fisk is 43.;  MISCELLANY; Strangest sight of the
night: A sellout Toronto crowd cheering when Dennis Eckersley struck out
George Bell in the ninth. Bell left the SkyDome an unpopular man last winter.
Despite the Blue Jays' rivalry with the A's, Eckersley was carrying the A.L.'s
hopes. . . . Happy 37th birthday to Cubs outfielder Andre Dawson. . . .
Upcoming All-Star sites: Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego (1992), Camden Yards
in Baltimore (1993) and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh (1994). This was
the first All-Star Game in Toronto and the second in Canada. Montreal was the
site in 1982. . . . N.L. Manager Lou Piniella became the 20th person to play
and then manage in an All-Star Game. The last to do so was Davey Johnson, who
managed the N.L. in the 1987 game. . . . Tom Glavine was the first left-handed
pitcher to start the game for the N.L. since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981, and
the first Braves pitcher to start since Warren Spahn (1949, 1958 and the first
game in 1961).  </TEXT>

   Q: Where are you if you see a bowl of M&amp;Ms and
find that someone has removed all the brown ones?
   A: Chances are, you're backstage at a concert by Van Halen;
members of the rock band specifically demand that all brown M&amp;Ms be
deleted.
   That's according to Leonard ``Cy'' Kocis, 41, the Mahwah,
N.J.-based caterer who services rockers and other entertainers on
the road. Sometimes, he said recently, his clients make peculiar
demands.
   For example:
   The rock group Rush wants Coca-Cola, but only in the
old-fashioned glass bottles. U2 wants shepherd's pie and Dom
Perignon champagne. Tiffany has a hankering for Evian water and ``a
variety of kosher meats.'' Bon Jovi requires Jolt cola, the
caffeine-laden drink. Frank Sinatra, by contrast, wanted only
Campbell's chicken and rice soup _ in a can.

   Eddie Murphy has a lot of devoted fans, but the
comedian really got his boat rocked during an outing in the
Bahamas, where he's working on his second music album.
   Murphy, 27, was taking a break and boating with friends when ``a
boat operated by overzealous fans collided with Mr. Murphy's boat,
slightly injuring him and his three companions,'' his publicist,
Terrie Williams, said Tuesday.
   All four were treated at a hospital in Nassau and released, said
Williams. Murphy is expected back in the United States later this
week.

   Two musicians who knew Michael Jackson during
his boyhood in Gary, Ind., claim in a $400 million federal lawsuit
that Jackson and Lionel Richie pirated such songs as ``Thriller''
and ``We Are The World.''
   Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith, both of Gary, and a third man,
Clifford Rubin of Chicago, are seeking the money from the two
singer-songwriters, producer Quincy Jones, and others.
   ``We deny the allegations vehemently in both suits. Both are
frivolous,'' Jackson's attorney, Robert Rotstein, said Tuesday.
   ``There are numerous such suits (against pop stars),'' said
Rotstein, who specializes in copyright cases. ``This happens all
the time. ... People are trying to trade in on the success of a
talented person.''
   Jones, Smith and Rubin claim their music can be heard on
Jackson's hit ``Thriller''' and ``We Are the World,'' the
Jackson-Richie anthem that raised money for starvation victims in
Africa.
   The defendants also say ``The Girl Is Mine'' and ``Another Part
of Me,'' from Jackson's latest album ``Bad,'' contain lyrics from
songs they wrote. The lawsuit was filed in November.
   Jones and Smith claim they grew up with the Jackson family in
Gary, and Jones claims to have helped the brothers launch their
career as the ``Jackson 5.''
   Rotstein said Michael Jackson may have known Jones and Smith
during his boyhood, but ``I don't think they had a close
relationship with Michael Jackson. They may have known a couple of
the other brothers,'' Rotstein said.
   The lawsuit is the second one pending against Jackson in Los
Angeles federal court that claims the pop superstar pirated ``We
Are The World.''

   Prince Charles helped dedicate a new
gallery of modern art that will give a boost to this ailing
industrial city once best known as the birthplace of the Beatles.
   Charles on Tuesday reopened a renovated complex of Victorian
warehouses in a development he hailed as of ``immense importance.''
One of the the buildings contains an extension of London's Tate
Gallery.
   ``This project will help enormously to restore the confidence of
people in areas which once knew great success and prosperity and
which will, I know, in due course return to that prosperity,'' the
prince said.
   The Tate Gallery is the national museum of British art and
international modern art. In Liverpool, it will show paintings and
sculpture that it doesn't always have space for in London.
   ``As Liverpool was already rich in museums and galleries, the
Tate extension makes it the second art city in England after
London,'' said the museum's curator, Richard Francis.

   Former ``Dynasty'' star Geoffrey
Scott, hospitalized for two weeks after his legs were crushed
between two cars, is recovering at home and expects to be walking
soon.
   Scott, who played Krystal's tennis-pro ex-husband and Alexis'
former lover from 1982 to 1984 on ``Dynasty,'' was on a bicycle
when he was struck by a car, his agent said Tuesday.
   The actor had stopped between two cars when one of the vehicles
lurched forward and pinned him between the bumper of another auto,
said agent Erin Connor.
   ``He's at home and he's doing fine,'' she said. ``He expects to
fully recover.''
   The 41-year-old actor, who also starred in the movie ``The
Morning After'' with Jane Fonda, was released from St. John's
Hospital last week, Ms. Connor said.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: INJURED LEUZINGER ACE WILL TRY TO PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher Tyrone Scott, considered one of the South Bay's top major 
league baseball prospects and the key to the Olympians' hopes for a Bay League 
title, has a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Derrel Thomas said Scott's injury, which he described as "tenderness of 
the elbow," may prevent the left-hander from pitching indefinitely. Scott has 
not pitched since April 11 when he first complained of soreness in a poor 
outing against Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Scott missed his scheduled start Tuesday in Leuzinger's 6-3 Bay League loss to 
Palos Verdes but will try to pitch in today's rematch with the Sea Kings at 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to warm up," Thomas said. "If his elbow is still tender, I won't 
let him pitch. Then we'll take it from there. If it's that bad, he has to go to 
the doctor and get it checked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrone wants to play major league baseball someday, and I feel he has a chance 
to do that. I don't want anything to happen that could endanger his future." 
</P>
<P>
The erratic Scott, who has continued to play center field and bat third, is 4-2 
with a 1.59 ERA and leads the South Bay with 72 strikeouts and 54 walks in 44 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was regarded as a contender for the Bay League title before the 
season but is struggling in a fifth-place tie at 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside forward Eddie Scott, whose cousin Byron played basketball at 
Arizona State before finding fame and fortune with the Lakers, also will play 
collegiately in the Grand Canyon state. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-7 Scott signed a letter of intent with Northern Arizona on Tuesday, the 
day before his 19th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people want to go to a big-name college with big-time players, but they 
don't get any playing time," Scott said. "Northern Arizona is giving me a 
chance to come in and start." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is considered a small college in basketball circles, Northern 
Arizona competes on the Division I level. The school's recruiting efforts in 
the South Bay also netted Harbor College guard Keith Billingslea. 
</P>
<P>
Scott needs to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to be eligible as a 
freshman, but he said Northern Arizona will accept him even if he has to sit 
out next year. He has two more chances to take the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Scott averaged a team-high 14.7 points a game and led Morningside (25-6) to the 
Ocean League championship, the semifinals of Southern Section 3-A playoffs and 
the finals of the Southern California Division III regionals. He was named 
Ocean League MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills made it two-for-two in recruiting Carson High's top 
basketball players by signing 6-5 forward Vincent Washington to a letter of 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Toros landed Carson guard Ray Bennett. Washington and Bennett 
were members of The Times South Bay All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited about each of our signees," said Dominguez Hills Coach 
Dave Yanai, who also signed 6-7 center Cesar Uballe of Bell and 6-5 forward 
Norm Francis of Fairfax. "They are well-rounded players who will contribute 
immediately while making an impact in our program over the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
Washington averaged 17 points and 8.3 rebounds to help Carson win the Pacific 
League title and reach the semifinals of the L.A. City 4-A playoffs. He was 
named the Pacific League MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa took a commanding two-game lead in the Ocean League volleyball race 
Tuesday with a 15-5, 15-8, 15-4 victory over visiting North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to 
11-0 overall and 9-0 in league behind the play of middle blocker Pat Ivie. 
Second-place North fell to 7-2 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa will venture north for a pair of non-league matches against 
10th-ranked Santa Barbara and Dos Pueblos on Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Cook's Mustangs are gearing up for the competitive Redondo 
Tournament on April 29. The 25-team field includes Corona del Mar, ranked 
fourth in 4-A; University of Irvine, ranked sixth; Palisades, defending L.A. 
City 4-A champion, and three of the top-ranked teams in the Southern Section 
3-A Division: Harvard of North Hollywood, Arcadia and Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance and West Torrance will play an alumni football game, the 
schools' third in the last five years, at 7 p.m. May 20 at North. 
</P>
<P>
North alumni interested in playing are asked to meet April 27 at the school 
football stadium or call the school at 533-4416. The team will be coached by 
Kelsey Baughfman, a former North player and an assistant coach for the Saxons. 
</P>
<P>
North has won the last two meetings with West. 
</P>

<HEAD>Gordon Jackson, Star of `Upstairs, Downstairs,' Dead at 66</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Gordon Jackson, who played the butler in
``Upstairs, Downstairs'' and brought his mellifluous Scots accent
to dozens of films, stage and television roles, has died, his agent
said today. He was 66.
   Jackson died Sunday in London's Cromwell Hospital with his wife,
Rona, at his side, Michael Anderson said. The cause of death was
not disclosed, but Anderson said Jackson had been ill for a short
time.
   The tall, ginger-haired Jackson started acting as a teen-ager
soon after the outbreak of World War II. His rueful expression
first typecast him as a coward and a weakling, although maturity
brought him a greater variety of roles.
   His acting career spanned nearly half a century and included
more than 60 film credits, but he was best known for his role as
the stiff-upper-lipped butler Hudson in the internationally
successful television series ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' from 1970 to
1975.
   He won a British Actor of the Year award in 1974 for the series,
reruns of which are still being shown in the United States.
   Jackson, described as gentle and self-effacing by friends, once
said: ``My trouble is that I'm underconfident and I'm too
tentative. I'm not a go-getter and I never have been.
   ``It's only when the curtain goes up and the cameras start to
roll that I don't enjoy this business.''
   Jackson was born in Glasgow in 1923. He started an
apprenticeship with Rolls Royce in Edinburgh, but got his first
professional acting job as in 1941, playing a Scottish soldier in
the film ``The Foreman Went to France,'' a story of Britons trapped
in France in 1940 by the German invasion.
   His film credits included ``Whisky Galore'' in 1948, ``Mutiny on
the Bounty'' in 1961, `The Great Escape'' in 1962, ``The Prime of
Miss Jean Brodie'' in 1968 and ``The Whistle Blower'' in 1986.
   He also played the tough undercover police chief Cowley in the
British TV thriller series ``The Professionals'' from 1977 to 1981,
and was in the 1988 TV movie ``Noble House.''
   On stage, he was Shakespeare's Banquo in ``Macbeth,'' Horatio in
``Hamlet,'' Mavolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and a host of other
characters in London's West End.
   ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' co-star John Alderton recalled Jackson
as ``the sweetest, gentlest man I have ever met. To have worked
with him was a privilege, to be counted as a friend was an honor.
His unparalleled contribution to film and television for over 50
years will remain a testament to his very special talent.''
   Jackson is survived by his wife, Rona, also an actress, and two
sons. Funeral plans have not been made.

CITY BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. POWERS CRENSHAW, MANUAL ARTS AGAIN HAVE STATE INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since March, when Manual Arts, the City's top-ranked and last surviving 
postseason basketball team, was ousted from the state playoffs, anticipation 
started to build for this season. 
</P>
<P>
With several City programs on the rise, at least four teams are considered 
among the state's best. City teams have won five of the nine modern State 
Division I titles: Crenshaw four of them and Manual Arts one. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Manual Arts won its first City 4-A title since 1981 by defeating 
Crenshaw, 84-72. But in the state playoffs, City teams were slighted. Manual 
Arts was seeded only third and Crenshaw and Fremont, which was runner-up in the 
3-A Division with a 29-3 record, were passed over. 
</P>
<P>
This season, quality teams and players can be found throughout the City 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
A look at The Times' preseason top 10 City Section basketball teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 27-4 
</P>
<P>
Third-year Coach Randolph Simpson has a solid team that is expected to repeat 
as City 4-A champion. Marcell Capers and All-City center William Celestine are 
gone, but the Toilers are still loaded with high-flying Kevin Beal, a 6-foot-5 
forward, and Dwain Bradberry, a returning starter at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts will start three forwards and two guards because it does not have a 
true center. The Toilers' strength will be balance: every Manual Arts starter 
is taller than 6-3. Roland Merriwether (6-3), Bryan Smith (6-4) and Wilbert 
Knight (6-3) are the other starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the real big man," Simpson said. "But, we have guys who all can 
handle the ball well, shoot well, and everyone plays above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
2. CRENSHAW 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-5 
</P>
<P>
Last season was supposed to be an off year for the Cougars, but Coach Willie 
West simply led Crenshaw to the 4-A final and finished with a 22-5 record. The 
Cougars have the two players who led them last season -- guards Kevin Ollie and 
Alexious Scruggs. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, a 6-2 senior, led Crenshaw in scoring last season and is joined in the 
backcourt by Scruggs, a 6-2 junior, who loves to shoot. Last season, Crenshaw 
did not have its usual depth but look for it this season as West goes for his 
12th City title. 
</P>
<P>
3. FREMONT 
</P>
<P>
Central League (3-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 28-3 
</P>
<P>
There are many who think that Coach Sam Sullivan has the best team in the City, 
despite being in the 3-A Division, and they may be right. Last season, the 
Pathfinders blasted into the 3-A final with a chance to win 30 games but were 
upset by North Hollywood. This season, Fremont may be even better. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ford, a 6-2 scoring swingman, and Michael Tate, a 6-7 inside force, lead 
the way for the Pathfinders, who won the 3-A title two seasons ago. Point guard 
Robert Moore controls Fremont's offense but a full-court pressure defense will 
again be the key for the Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
4. FAIRFAX 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-6 
</P>
<P>
Coach Harvey Kitani may have the sleeper team of the season, led by 6-5 Ryan 
Hickman and scoring guard Burt Harris. Last season Hickman averaged 18.5 points 
and 12.5 rebounds a game, and Harris has been the leading scorer for the Lions 
so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
5. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
Pacific League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 19-9 
</P>
<P>
Carson is best known as a football power, but this season, Coach Richard Masson 
has a basketball team that could duplicate its counterpart's success. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Colts is Rudy Washington, a 6-4 junior forward. The key 
for the Colts, though, could be the return of Khary Stanley, a 6-9 junior 
center, who has been out with a back injury. Look for Carson to be a force late 
in the season when it can feature a deep lineup with Stanley and several 
football players , who will return to action. 
</P>
<P>
6. WESTCHESTER 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 16-11 
</P>
<P>
The Comets have only one starting senior, but he is LeRoi O'Brien, a 6-8 
center. O'Brien averaged double figures in both scoring and rebounding last 
season. Coach Ed Azzam will look for leadership from O'Brien, but juniors James 
Gray, Lorenzo Ball and Marty Cotwright will have to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
7. RESEDA CLEVELAND 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 21-5 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had Crenshaw on the ropes in the 4-A semifinals last season 
before losing in overtime, 91-90. Kevin Crider, who previously coached at Los 
Angeles High, is now the coach at Cleveland and has an experienced starting 
five. Kayheed Murray, a 6-5 senior, and Brandon Martin, a 6-4 junior, give the 
Cavaliers a solid forward combination. Cleveland will need time to adjust to 
Cryder, who is the team's fourth coach in a little more than a year, but should 
be a contender for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
8. WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 12-10 
</P>
<P>
Before starting high school, Barnabas James was touted as one the area's top 
players. Now, the 6-7 James is a senior and has slowly begun to live up to his 
potential. James, who averaged 18 points a game last season, leads a Washington 
team that will also have the scoring of guard Kevin Griffis. 
</P>
<P>
9. DORSEY 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-6 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Kevin Gibson has a team that may be a year away, but look for 
the Dons to get better as the season goes on. Lynell Wiggins, a 5-6 point 
guard, and Juan Harris, a 6-7 center, are key returners. Depth will be a key 
for the Dons with Marquette Davis, Davey Fortson and Eric Scott, who will be 
joined by Keyshawn Johnson and Lamont Warren when football season ends. 
</P>
<P>
10. GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 17-9 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders have two starting forwards returning, Adrian Sellers and Jerry 
Allen, who combined to average 19 points a game last season. Coach Bob Johnson 
will feature a running attack, with point guard Jevon Lee leading the way.

LAKERS PROVE THEY HAVE PLENTY IN RESERVES; 
</P>
<P>
BENCH REPELS SUNS, 127-119, IN GAME ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During training camp in Hawaii last fall, Laker Coach Pat Riley boldly 
predicted that his promising corps of reserves would prove to be the deepest, 
most productive in his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Little that happened during the regular season supported Riley's prediction. 
But in Game 1 of the NBA Western Conference finals Saturday, when it was needed 
the most, his bench helped lift the Lakers to a 127-119 victory over the 
Phoenix Suns before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Thrust into lead roles by necessity, the supporting players had to perform if 
the Lakers were to overcome the Suns, who overcame a 16-point first-half 
deficit in the opening game of this seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson was on the bench with five fouls, eventually fouling out late in 
the game. Byron Scott, also in foul trouble, spent much of the second half 
sitting next to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sat out the final five minutes because of an injured 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
In came Orlando Woolridge, Mychal Thompson and Michael Cooper to rescue their 
more famous teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When your key guys are out," Woolridge said, "everybody out on the court has 
got to do something extra. You have to." 
</P>
<P>
So, even though James Worthy scored 32 points and stifled counterpart Tom 
Chambers, nearly everyone concerned credited the Laker bench for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the difference today," Riley said of his reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"(Woolridge) was outstanding. He paid his rent today. Coop ran the offense very 
well. We know it's going to take eight men to beat these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Not eight at once, of course. But against a team with so many offensive 
resources, led by multi-talented point guard Kevin Johnson, Laker depth was 
essential merely to keep pace. Woolridge scored 11 of his 13 points in the 
second half and added seven rebounds, three assists, two blocked shots and a 
key steal late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper ably ran the Laker offense in Magic Johnson's absence and took over 
Scott's unenviable task of guarding Kevin Johnson, who had 27 points and 18 
assists in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And Thompson, who had eight points and six rebounds in relief of Abdul-Jabbar, 
combined with Woolridge for what might have been the game-clinching play. 
</P>
<P>
With two minutes left and Magic Johnson having fouled out, the Lakers held a 
116-111 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns threw a half-court trap at the Lakers, and the best shot they could 
get was a baseline jump shot by Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
He missed, but Thompson grabbed the rebound. He then fed Woolridge charging 
through the lane for a dunk shot while being fouled by Tyrone Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's free throw gave the Lakers an eight-point lead with 1:35 left, and 
they were not threatened thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"Woolridge made the big plays," Phoenix forward Eddie Johnson said. "Mychal got 
that offensive rebound that killed us, and then Woolridge got that big 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take advantage (of the Laker reserves). If we had someone come up 
and say to us before the game, 'What would you like (to happen), we definitely 
would've took (having Magic and Scott in foul trouble). But we just didn't do 
what we had to do to win in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers did. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Johnson fouling out for the first time in the playoffs since 1981, and 
despite having Scott on the bench for an 11-minute stretch in the second half, 
the Lakers persevered and remained unbeaten in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Dating to last season, the Lakers have won 10 straight playoff games, an NBA 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy continued his prolific playoff scoring, making 13 of 22 shots. He also 
held Chambers, averaging 26.1 points coming in, to 15 points. Chambers made 
only five of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played and been around Tom a long time," said Worthy. "I respect him, and 
you have to give him all your energy." 
</P>
<P>
All but four of A.C. Green's 18 points came in the first half, when the Lakers 
made 61.4% of their shots. All told, he made eight of nine shots and led the 
Lakers with 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Production from the forwards was needed because of the Lakers' foul trouble. 
Johnson made only six of 13 shots for 18 points and Scott scored 24. After the 
Suns took a 100-99 lead on Eddie Johnson's basket with 7:40 left, Johnson 
returned to the lineup, having been preceded by Scott one possession earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored five more points before fouling out with 2:23 remaining. Scott 
sank three straight jump shots, then made a driving layup with 1:16 left that 
gave the Lakers a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson received his fifth foul, for charging, with about four minutes to play 
in the third quarter. It came one possession after he incurred his fourth foul 
on a similar call. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Earvin saw that he was coming out and wanted to give it one last 
drive," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was replaced by Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'O' was the key," Worthy said. "He made the big plays. He had some 
rebounds when we really needed them. And he can be an intimidator with his 
blocked shots." 
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the bench, Johnson was Woolridge's biggest supporter. He 
waved his fist during timeouts and rushed over to offer congratulations and 
advice to Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Orlando gave us a spark we haven't had," Johnson said. "What I liked today was 
that he wasn't just making the offensive plays. He blocked some shots, got a 
big steal (late in the game) and some rebounds, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we need. Early and midway through (the regular season), our bench 
wasn't (producing enough). But in the last week of the season and now the 
playoffs, we've got confidence in them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woolridge, who also made five of six free throws: "In the past, I've been 
characterized as only an offensive player. But I'm working more on intangibles. 
I got a couple of rebounds and then (during a timeout), Magic came around and 
really pumped me up. Coming from a guy you respect, that gives you confidence 
and helps you to get to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that, by the end of the playoffs, this could be remembered as the 
deepest Laker bench of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say it should be the best," Riley said. "It should be productive. 
They are capable of doing that. Mychal and Coop always have known their roles. 
Orlando is starting to get into it. He's starting to lend some support." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cotton Fitzsimmons' losing streak at the Forum now is 34 games. His last 
victory in the Forum came on Feb. 17, 1973, while coaching the Atlanta Hawks. . 
. . The Lakers have won 13 straight games, the last eight coming in the 
playoffs. Their longest winning streak during the regular season was seven 
games. . . . Kevin Johnson's 18 assists marked a career high and a Suns' 
playoff record. . . . The last time Magic Johnson fouled out of a game in the 
playoffs was on April 3, 1981, against the Houston Rockets. The last time it 
happened during the regular season was March 7, 1984, against Philadelphia in 
the Forum. . . . The Lakers shot 59.8% Saturday, their highest percentage of 
the in this playoffs. . . . Both teams wore black stripes on their jerseys in 
honor of Larry Fleisher, former director of the NBA Players Assn., who died in 
New York on May 11.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Scots dined on haggis, the
French had foie gras and the Americans enjoyed steak and a radio
special by comedian Robin Williams. But New Year's celebrations for
the gulf troops were generally low-key.
   The important date for the troops is Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline
for Iraq to get out of Kuwait or face a possible military strike to
drive it from the emirate.
   Although soldiers yearned for a cup of kindness, New Year's was
non-alcoholic because of Saudi Arabia's strict Muslim ban on
liquor.
   ``There's no booze. What are you going to do? Have another
Coke?'' said Marine Col. M.L. Haiman, 49, of the Bronx, New York.
``People have their eye on the 15th of January.''
   The troops in the multinational force have been on heightened
alert throughout the holidays in case Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein launches a pre-emptive strike.
   ``It's a prime time for the other side to come after us, on our
holidays when they think our guard might slip. If they think that,
they're wrong,'' said Haiman.
   The only official celebrations were by the approximately 3,000
men of the Scottish regiments in the British 1st Armored Division,
made up of the 4th Armored Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade, the
famed Desert Rats.
   ``All the Scots will want to celebrate Hogmanay,'' said division
spokesman Capt. James Myles, using the Scottish term for the
holiday.
   The Scots ate a traditional meal of haggis and mashed turnips,
ushered into the camps by bagpipes. Haggis is made of the heart,
liver and lungs of a sheep or calf, and minced with onions, oatmeal
and boiled in the stomach of an animal.
   The 6,000 French troops toasted with ``Saudi champagne'' - a
mixture of apple juice and Perrier.
   ``Our own costs a lot more, but for that we'll have to wait for
our return,'' said Adjutant Robert Simon, spokesman for the French
forces.
   Special food like chocolate and foie gras - duck liver pate -
had been flown in from France, he said.
   Many U.S. troops said they had not even thought about the
holiday due to their fierce training schedules, but there were some
small celebrations.
   Many units barbecued steaks left over from Christmas.
   ``I'm going to get myself a six-pack of near-beer and have a
near-party and sit around and play some cards,'' said Staff Sgt.
David Hebert, 30, of Brickton, N.J., in the 3rd Platoon of the
Army's 595th Medical Company.
   Many troops planned to tune in to a Robin William's special,
pre-recorded for the Armed Forces Radio Network.
   Williams, re-enacting his radio role of Adrian Kronauer in the
film ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' yelled, ``Good Maaawwwrning,
Saaauuudi'' and then told jokes like, ``Is it just me, or does
Yasser Arafat look like Ringo Starr?''
   While Saudis educated in the West tend to celebrate New Year's
with private parties at home, as do foreigners living here, it's
not an official Moslem holiday
   The Muslims follow a lunar calendar and their new year marks the
date when the prophet Mohammed, founder of the faith, emigrated in
the 7th century from Mecca to Medina, both now holy shrines in
Saudi Arabia. Their new year falls on July 12, 1991, on the
Christian calendar.
   There was one almost universal New Year's resolution among the
troops.
   ``They're all the same. I know what they all are: To leave and
go home,'' said Staff Sgt. Johnnie Montgomery, 27, of Annaston,
Ala., of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion.

PIERCE, 15, FACES A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born in Canada, reared in Florida and living in France, 15-year-old Mary Pierce 
holds three passports, a No. 136 ranking and a great deal of promise. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy for someone so young to become part of the news, except for those 
who make a big splash in tournaments, as did 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati and 
16-year-old Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Pierce is best known for what she has left: the U.S. Tennis Assn., Nick 
Bollettieri's Tennis Academy, Harry Hopman's camp, Florida, America and the 
lasting impression that her father, who is also her coach, might be the most 
overbearing tennis parent of all. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pierce, 54, picked up and moved his family to his wife's native France 
after a row with the USTA over financial and coaching support for his daughter. 
In a recent Sports Illustrated article, the elder Pierce acknowledged, among 
other things, to once yelling during a match, "Mary, kill the bitch." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce, who said she has not read the story, is loyal to her father. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't do anything to hurt me or anything like that," Pierce said. "He's 
on the court trying to get the best out of me. I don't see anything wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her father does, Pierce said: "Nothing, he watches me." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Pierce travels with his daughter as she struggles to break in on the 
pro tour. Coming into next week's Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at Manhattan 
Country Club, Pierce has won $23,920 this year and $31,958 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Capriati, who signed endorsements worth $5 million, Pierce has no 
endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is still highly regarded as a potential star. At 5-feet-10 and 120 
pounds, she plays an aggressive baseline game designed to put pressure on her 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was difficult to know for sure who Pierce's opponent might 
be. Before the French Open, Pierce announced that she wanted to represent 
France, rejecting the USTA. She played in the Federation Cup for France two 
weeks ago in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's task will be to try to be equal to her buildup while riding out a 
semi-controversial start. She said she can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I don't feel any pressure," Pierce said. "When I go on the court, I'm 
having fun. So I don't worry about it."

BREWER COACH TONY MUSER TENDS TO PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS AT BURN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him Talking Tony Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser, of Los 
Alamitos, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something 
that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It 
wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55% of his body. He was delirious for more than a week, 
incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of 
hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with Mike Lorenzo, 
who is recovering from burns over 80% of his body. "We haven't seen him smile 
like that since he's been here," physical therapist Linda French said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," Lewis said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in a Baltimore 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and 
wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," Muser said, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, was the turning point of 
his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I 
was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can 
be until you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," Muser 
said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique 
relationship he developed with other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

SCOTT, GEORGIA TECH STEAL WIN FROM NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main thing Dennis Scott didn't want to do was rush his shot after coming up 
with a steal with five seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Scott stole an inbounds pass, calmly turned and, with two seconds left, hit his 
seventh three-point basket of the game to give Georgia Tech a 76-74 Atlantic 
Coast Conference victory over No. 5 North Carolina Wednesday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely, totally incredible," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said 
after the Yellow Jackets snapped a string of seven straight losses to the Tar 
Heels. "It's just unbelievable. What a steal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "This might have been the biggest shot of my whole life. The DePaul 
shot (a game-winner last season) was big, but this was UNC, the conference and 
the seniors' last home game. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had enough time left and I didn't want to rush it. It would have 
killed me if I had missed an easy shot for the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who scored 28 points, made the steal in the left corner, turned and hit 
the game-winning shot that gave the Yellow Jackets only their sixth victory in 
38 meetings with the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dean Smith said he was disappointed his Tar Heels couldn't wrap up their 
11th regular-season ACC crown in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech is 20-9 overall and 8-5 in the conference. North Carolina, which 
had a six-game winning streak snapped, is 24-6 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hammonds, the third-leading scorer in Yellow Jacket history, had his jersey 
No. 20 retired before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State 76, Missouri 75 -- Tony Massop's tip-in at the buzzer gave Kansas 
State the Big Eight Conference win over seventh-ranked Missouri at Manhattan, 
Kan., which enabled Oklahoma to clinch the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's Greg Church, in the best game of his career, made two free throws 
with 11 seconds remaining to give Missouri a 75-74 lead. Church, a 6-8 senior 
whose previous career high was 18 points, had 31. Steve Henson, who had 23 
points for Kansas State, missed a shot as the clock wound down, but Massop 
tipped in the miss. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State is 18-8 and 8-5. Missouri, coming off a victory over Oklahoma that 
knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 national ranking, is 23-7 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers missed only two of 24 free throws but still fell to 3-4 under 
interim Coach Rich Daly. The Tigers have not won on the road since Daly 
replaced Norm Stewart, who underwent cancer surgery last month and was released 
from a hospital earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 111, Oklahoma State 108 -- Stacey King scored 27 points, including a 
basket with 12 seconds left, as the fourth-ranked Sooners wrapped up the Big 
Eight title with the win at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
By winning its 29th straight at home, Oklahoma improved to 25-4 overall and 
11-2 in conference. Oklahoma State, which knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 
spot in the national with a victory earlier this season, is 16-10 and 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State pulled within a point on Darwyn Alexander's free throw with 52 
seconds left. But when he missed his second try, King rebounded and the Sooners 
worked the clock until Mookie Blaylock drove into the lane and dished off to 
King under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock's final assist gave him 11 in the game, making him the first player in 
NCAA history to record 200 assists and 100 steals in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Oklahoma State's Royce Jeffries' with four seconds left 
bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
The 108 points is the most Oklahoma State has ever scored in a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 77, Louisville 71 -- Louis Banks scored 24 points and Cincinnati 
made 10 straight free throws in the final minute to cap the Metro Conference 
comeback victory over the 14th-ranked Cardinals at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (19-8, 8-4), led, 55-45, with 11 minutes left when Cincinnati took 
over. Two free throws by Levertis Robinson with 4:26 left capped an 18-7 spurt 
that gave the Bearcats the lead for good, 63-62. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (15-11, 5-6) led, 67-65, when Louisville's LaBradford Smith missed a 
free throw three minutes later. The Bearcats then began their string of free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 79, Duke 74 -- Elden Campbell scored six straight points to key a late 
scoring surge that carried the Tigers to the ACC upset win at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 69-69, the Tigers scored seven straight points and held 
the Blue Devils scoreless for 3 1/2 minutes. 
</P>

   Melody Thomas Scott says that in nine years
on CBS' ``The Young and the Restless'' her character has grown up
and undergone changes.
   ``When I began, Nikki was very poor, lower-class and troubled,''
she said. ``She's still troubled, but now she's rich.''
   Scott also grew up on the show. Three years ago she married the
executive producer, Edward Scott, and they are expecting their
first child at Thanksgiving.
   Although she was a teen-ager when she began the daytime serial,
she was already a veteran performer. She had worked with Clint
Eastwood twice as well as Kirk Douglas, John Wayne and Geraldine
Page.
   Her character, Nikki Reed Newman, has also packed a lot of
living into her years on ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``She's gone through many marriages, many phases,'' said Scott.
``She's been a stripper, a model, a member of a cult and chased by
a psychotic killer. In my first story on the show my father tried
to rape me. I don't think that went over well with the audience. I
hit him over the head, he died and that was the end of that.
   ``Now I'm married to the Howard Hughes of Genoa City. It's not a
happy marriage. We had a storybook romance and wedding. My wedding
gown cost $25,000. It was wonderful for a while. We still live
together, but we live separate lives. Now that I'm pregnant I'm
hoping he will change his mind.''
   Her husband on the show is Victor Newman, played by Eric Braeden.
   ``I'm very happy with the show,'' said Scott. ``In my opinion
it's the best medium for an actress who wants to have a family. The
hours for a prime-time show are horrendous. I wouldn't want to be
running around the world on location. I usually don't go in until
noon. I'm usually through by 6 o'clock. It works out very good for
me.''
   Although the soap has about 25 regular characters, the main
storyline follows Nikki and her husband. The story began about 2{
years ago when ``The Young and the Restless'' began to challenge
ABC's ``General Hospital'' for the ratings leadership among the
daytime serials. In the current season, it is ranking first in the
Nielsen daytime ratings.
   Scott was born in Los Angeles and started her career at age 3 as
one of ``The Meglin Kiddies.'' Ethel Meglin, who recently died, had
started such other performers as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
The Meglin group put on musical performances around California.
   ``I was raised by my grandmother, who always talked about Jane
Withers,'' she said. ``She was one of my idols.'' Withers, probably
best known to current generations for her ``Josephine the Plumber''
commercials several years ago, was a major child star.
   Scott also appeared in commercials and did guest spots on such
shows as ``My Three Sons'' and ``Ironside.'' At 8, she played Tippi
Hedren's daughter in ``Marnie.'' She was a regular on ``The Tammy
Grimes Show.''
   ``I never thought much about doing the shows,'' she said. ``When
you're that young you don't think about it. I thought all kids did
it.''
   When she was in junior high school she read in a trade paper
that director Don Siegel was looking for ``a chubby little girl''
to appear with Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page in ``The
Beguiled.'' She stuffed herself to gain weight, then rented a Civil
War costume and auditioned for Siegel. She got the role, and later
when Siegel directed Eastwood in ``Dirty Harry'' he remembered her
and put her in the movie.
   She was also in ``Posse'' with Kirk Douglas and such TV movies
and miniseries as ``Studs Lonigan,'' ``Moviola'' and ``Secrets.''
She had a recurring role on ``The Waltons.''
   Scott appeared with John Wayne in his last movie, ``The
Shootist.''
   ``I played the sweet little girl in that,'' she said. ``I had a
scene with John Wayne on a streetcar. It was a thrill to do that.''
   She met her husband while doing ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``He's been producer about 12 or 13 years,'' she said. ``For
many years we had just a working relationship. Then we became
friends and we got married three years ago.''
   She has a 5-year-old daughter, Alexandra, from an earlier
marriage, and her husband has a 15-year-old daughter, Jennifer.

TITLE FOE WARNS MORNINGSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: BERKELEY HIGH COACH SAYS THE LADY MONARCHS WILL BE IN FOR A 
TOUGH FIGHT IN SATURDAY'S STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Berkeley High School girls basketball Coach Gene Nakamura doesn't think it 
would be prudent for Morningside to print up those "Back-to-Back State 
Champions" T-shirts just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura's comparatively unsung Yellowjackets (31-1) play the well-publicized 
Lady Monarchs (31-3) on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. in the Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum Arena for the state Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not awed by them at all," Nakamura said earlier this week. "We're 
confident, OK? They are going to have to come and play a game against us 
because we're ready to play. And when we're on our game, we play like guys, not 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents have double- and triple-teamed 6-foot-5 Morningside center Lisa 
Leslie, who has nonetheless scored 27 points per game. But Nakamura said his 
team will often play the senior All-American with straight man-to-man defense 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said that approach is justified because he has the better post player 
in 6-0 senior Jualeah Woods, who is averaging 18 points per game. The Lady 
Monarchs beat the Yellowjackets early last season, but Berkeley led for much of 
the game and eschewed gimmick defenses against Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Woods played (Leslie) head up and outplayed her," Nakamura said. 
"We know what we can do, and we know what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anxious to play them again, and the approach will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Morningside Coach Frank Scott said he is eager for his team to 
face a non-doubling defense. But he said he doubts that it will last. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they do it that way," Scott said. "She's kind of tough to play 
one-on-one. If Lisa is effective, I think they'll have to go to the double 
team. Woods is a good player, but I don't think she can handle Lisa 
one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
The game will be played just a few minutes down the freeway from the Berkeley 
campus, but Nakamura isn't counting on a big home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, we have not received a lot of (fan) support," said Nakamura, 
whose team trails only Morningside in the Cal-Hi Sports Weekly Division I 
ratings and won the Northern California Regional championship in Oakland last 
Saturday. "But the fact that we are playing Morningside is going to draw a lot 
of people because they want to see Lisa Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, when they come to see Lisa Leslie, they're going to see a hell of a 
Berkeley team." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who took the Monarchs to a tournament in Tennessee earlier this season, 
said playing in the Bay Area "will help (Berkeley) a little, but it won't hurt 
us much. We're used to playing on the road and have played in some pretty 
foreign places." 
</P>
<P>
The Yellowjackets have outscored their opponents by an average of 36 points per 
game and feature up to six future NCAA Division I players, Nakamura said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting along with Woods will be junior forward Alexandra Kay, who is 
averaging 16 points per game. Junior Tanda Rucker (18 points per game) is the 
point guard, while sophomore Lynda Robinson (13 points) and senior Vikki Horne 
(eight points) are also in Berkeley's three-guard lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Janet Davis (10 points per game) and junior Akiba Flanagan (five 
points) start at forward for the Lady Monarchs. Morningside juniors Princess 
Murray (six points) and Bridgete Williams (nine points) are the usual starting 
guards, but junior Tyesha Whiting will start in place of Williams, who injured 
ligaments in her leg last week. (Although it was originally thought that 
Williams was out for the season, she has a chance to play Saturday, Scott 
said.) 
</P>
<P>
Scott saw Berkeley play at this season's Tournament of Champions in Santa 
Barbara. The Yellowjackets suffered their only loss of the year there to Los 
Angeles Washington, the team Morningside beat, 61-45, for the right to 
represent Southern California in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a fine team," Scott acknowledged. "They have some good athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"(Woods) is a legitimate 6-footer and very quick. And they have a good guard in 
Tanda Rucker." 
</P>
<P>
Scott may be underestimating the Yellowjackets if he thinks they have just one 
good guard, according to Nakamura, who said: "I figure I've got three of the 
best guards in the state -- two of the best defensive guards and probably the 
best point in the state." 
</P>
<P>
And with Williams not starting for Morningside, Nakamura added, his team has "a 
back-court advantage" which it will try to exploit at both ends of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We push the ball up and play pressure defense," he said. "They will have to 
make some adjustments to play against our speed, our press and our 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We make very few fundamental-skill turnovers. We just don't make mistakes, and 
we do not beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Williams hasn't played in the last two Morningside games, and Scott admitted 
that the Lady Monarchs have been susceptible to turnover problems recently. But 
he said he has confidence in his guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've handled (Williams' absence) pretty well so far," he said. "I think we'll 
be OK there." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens on the perimeter, the focus of the game for most observers 
will remain in the lane -- because that's where Lisa Leslie is. But Nakamura 
maintains that they're going to find themselves watching a lot of Jualeah 
Woods, too. 
</P>
<P>
"(Leslie) gets a lot of P.R. and so does Janet (Davis)," he said. "Woods is 
probably not getting her due. If you ask any of the college coaches on the 
coast, they'll tell you that she's an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, this summer at an all-star camp in Long Beach, Woods got MVP 
over Lisa. The same schools that are after Lisa are after Jualeah."

<HEAD>Ireland's Foremost Architect Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Scott, Ireland's foremost
architect who designed his country's shamrock-shaped pavilion at the
1939 New York World's Fair, has died at the age of 83.
   Scott, who died Tuesday at home, designed some of Dublin's
best-known modern buildings, including the state broadcasting
company's headquarters, the central bus station, and the home of the
Abbey Theater, Ireland's premier playhouse.
   The World's Fair building, named best pavilion by an
international jury, won him global recognition, and Mayor Fiorello
La Guardia awarded Scott honorary citizenship of New York.
   A lover of the writings of James Joyce, Scott built his home by
the seaside south of Dublin next to the Martello Tower, where the
novel ``Ulysses'' opens. In the 1950s he and two friends purchased
the distinctive cylindrical tower to turn it into a Joyce museum.
   He was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects
and in 1975 received the Royal Institute of Architects Gold medal,
the only Irishman to win the prestigious British honor.
   Born June 24, 1905 in Drogheda, Scott was an accomplished actor
before taking up architecture full-time. Specializing in the plays
of Sean O'Casey, he took the lead role in the 1927 Broadway
production of ``The Plough and the Stars.''
   His wife, Patricia, died in 1969. He is survived by four sons and
a daughter.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Bulls on the Rampage
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12

<LP>
   Inglewood, Calif. -- It was do or almost die for the Los
Angeles Lakers here Sunday, and they didn't. They won the
first quarter of their National Basketball Association
playoff game with the Chicago Bulls, but thoroughly lost the
last three and the game, 97-82. That put them down three
games to one in the best-of-seven championship series, a
position that's unenviable, to say the least.
   "We're in a ditch, not just a hole," said Laker coach Mike
Dunleavy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I never dreamed this would happen. I never even thought
about it," marveled Earvin "Magic" Johnson, the Laker star.
   Theoretically, anything is possible, and maybe the Lakers
can win here tomorrow night and in Chicago Friday and Sunday.
But basketball is practical stuff, and in practice the young,
dashing Bulls are stuffing L.A. and show no signs of
stopping.
   Indeed, this series would be over already if Sam Perkins,
a 6-foot-9 Laker forward who sinks 23-foot, three-point shots
about as often as 23-foot putts, hadn't sunk one in the
closing seconds of game one in Chicago to boost his team to a
93-91 victory. The Bulls outscored the Lakers by a total of
44 points in winning at home last Wednesday and in L.A.'s
mustard-colored Forum on Friday and Sunday, a sum that's all
the more remarkable because Friday's contest went to
overtime.
   And while it is against jock-union rules to anticipate
future triumphs, Michael Jordan, the Bulls' Mr. Wonderful,
couldn't resist a peek. When the Bulls came to The City
Where/You Can See the Air, he'd said their goal was to win
enough games to bring the series back to Chicago for game six
and, if need be, seven. But asked Sunday if he still wanted
to return, he grinned broadly. "Yeah," said he. "That's where
I live."
   All this is, rightly, causing joy in the Windy City, one
burg that has never called itself Titletown, U.S.A., but
there's consternation elsewhere. As newsfolks of all stripes
have been telling us, the Bulls vs. the Lakers -- Michael
versus Magic; the first-time finalists vs. the perennial
champs -- was the NBA showdown we wanted to see. Yet it's
just about over as quick as you can say "alley-oop."
   So bad luck for the rest of us. Also for NBC, which, it is
reported, needed a long and hotly contested final to justify
the bushels of bucks it put up to broadcast the thing.
   But it's the intent of the Bulls to win as efficiently as
they can, and that's what they've done after their first-game
setback. The gang that used to be known as the Michael Jordan
Five has performed of late like a team, with a capital "T,"
and not a bit too soon. They've won 14 of their 16 playoff
games, in earlier rounds having swept New York and
defending-champ Detroit, and disposed of Philadelphia, four
games to one.
   "We couldn't have picked a better time to put it all
together," noted John Paxson, their veteran guard, after
Sunday's go.
   The Bulls' emergence as pro hoops' putative numero uno has
coincided with their dedication to defense, an
often-overlooked part of the slam-bang NBA game, and their
decision, often voiced but only recently realized, to spread
the wealth, pointswise. In the present series, they have
upset L.A.'s patient, set-up-the-big-men style of attack by
keeping the ball out of the hands of playmaker Johnson as
much as possible, and not allowing his mates to do the things
they prefer. The key to the success of those tactics has been
the kind of speed afoot that causes foes' eyes to pop.
   "It seems like they double-team everybody who gets the
ball. They even double-teamed me]" exclaimed the ponderous
Perkins on Sunday, acting as though the honor of such
attention took some of the sting from a 1-for-15 shooting
disaster that limited him to three points.
   The business of playing the game with all the fellas on
the floor instead of letting Michael do it alone might have
been more difficult, if only because Michael can do so much.
The league's leading scorer these past five campaigns, the
6-foot-5 guard possesses that rare combination of craft and
spontaneity that adds up to athletic genius.
   Interestingly, among those he's capable of surprising is
himself. On Wednesday night, in a 107-86 Bulls win, he soared
basketward with the ball in his right hand, high above his
head, but on his way down changed it to his left and deftly
flipped in it through a forest of Laker arms. Watching the TV
replay later, His Highness soberly commented that the move
was "incredible," and one can only conclude he was as
entertained by it as anyone.
   But Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who's so low-key that he's
one of the few in his profession who refers to his team as
"they" rather than "we," says that sacrificing some of
Jordan's individual brilliance was the price of success. "For
us to become a team that could win rather than be just a good
team, Michael had to give up some of the ball and some of the
spotlight," Jackson says quietly. "It came down to a matter
of trust, and it didn't come quickly. But I think we have it
now."
   Jordan has led the Bulls in scoring in every game of the
playoffs, but his supporting cast also has had its share of
bouquets. Scottie Pippen, a blade-thin forward and Chicago's
all-around second banana, has averaged 18 points a game
against the Lakers and leads the team in playoff rebounds.
Horace Grant, a "power forward" who's quicker than he is
powerful, scored 20 points in each of games two and three on
19-for-23 shooting. Paxson, who when left to himself shoots
as well from long range as anyone, took advantage of Laker
pressure on his mates to hit on all eight of his field goal
attempts Wednesday, and on seven of 11 Sunday.
   And Bill Cartwright, a center best known for his sharp
elbows and suffering-poet face, has been able to put his
contorted shooting style to effective use. Said Johnson:
"They got the one man nobody else got {Jordan, of course},
but their other guys have really stepped up. Even Bill got
into it today."
   Sunday's contest wasn't the Bulls most decisive win of the
final, but it showed their advantages most clearly. After a
first quarter that ended with them trailing 2827, they
pierced L.A.'s defenses from outside and in while denying the
Lakers similarly. Jordan led the scoring with 28 points, but
the four other Chicago starters tallied between 12 and 15
each. The Bulls shot 52%, blocked eight shots to three for
the taller Lakers, and set a playoff-finals record by
committing just five turnovers.
   The Lakers, meantime, were hounded into shooting a poor
36% from the field, and their 82-point total was a 10-year
finals low. Two players -- Johnson and center Vlade Divac --
accounted for 49 of their points, with most of Divac's coming
on Magic's radar feeds.
   In fact, it was the Lakers, not the Bulls, who looked like
the one-man team, with the twinkly eyed Johnson being that
man. In game one, his team was outscored 10-0 in the five
minutes he was rested, and on Sunday they managed but two
free throws while he took a three-minute second-quarter
break.
   The Lakers seemed worn as well as weary. James Worthy,
their regular-season scoring leader who has been dogged by a
sprained ankle, played little in the second half, and
shooting guard Byron Scott withdrew with a shoulder injury.
   Johnson, who will turn 32 before the summer is done, has
poo-pooed the notion that age has caught up with his veteran
club, but he conceded that something has.
   "We anticipated a great series, not being dominated like
this," said he.

were having better seasons than they were. And if the fans were going to
overlook Sierra, they may as well have voted in Ken Griffey Sr.;    We also
liked your choice of Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla over Cincinnati's Chris Sabo
as the National League third baseman. And the fans clearly blew it when they
voted in Los Angeles outfielder Darryl Strawberry.;    But we do have a
question for you, the readers:;    How the heck could you leave Andre Dawson
out of your lineup?;    And just when you thought it was safe to put all this
All-Star controversy to rest, here's the way our staff experts picked 'em:;

COACH: Dave Johnson, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Bulldogs need a pair of pitchers' arms to heal in a 
hurry. Senior right-hander Jeremy Sparks, a returning starter who batted .500 
last season, is raring to go. But senior left-hander Brian Gordon (6-2, 190) 
and junior right-hander Joon Kwon are nursing injuries. Gordon suffered a 
shoulder injury during football season and will be the designated-hitter until 
he is able to throw. Kwon, a potentially overpowering submariner, is recovering 
from a sprained back. Left-hander Jason Chandler and right-hander Shawn 
Williams throw hard, Johnson said, but are rough around the edges. "At this 
point, I don't want to say we're going to be strong in pitching," Johnson said. 
He might be wise to reserve judgment on his fielders too. Players are battling 
for positions throughout: Chandler and junior Jeff Kadis at first base; juniors 
Teddy Gonzalez and Steve Rutkoske, both up from the junior varsity, at second; 
Sparks, Williams and junior Andy Salazar, at third. Senior catcher Steve Kelley 
(6-0, 200), who batted .330 last season, is a returning starter. Senior center 
fielder Brian Miclette is a first-year starter, and juniors Ozzie Areu, Ryan 
Woodburn and Jason Miller are vying for outfield positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Johnson inherited a program that he claims was in disarray. 
Consequently, he is aiming for long-range goals. "We're looking to turn things 
around, but the emphasis is going to be on doing things right," he said. "We'll 
field the ground ball, hit the cut-off man and pick off people. . . . It's a 
big mistake to set goals that are unrealistic, but we're going to be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Coach Terry Scott, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-12; 3rd in league at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team's top six batters graduated, and most of the current 
Indians spent last season on the junior varsity. Only three varsity players 
return and all were sophomores last season. Second baseman Mike Medina and 
shortstop Eddie Gavilan, both 5-foot-8, form a tiny but tight double-play 
tandem. "People will be amazed at what they do," Scott said. "They're good and 
they're very tough at the plate." Catcher Bobby Sherwood (5-10, 185) was a 
backup last year. Lanky right-handers Mike Rossiter (6-5, 185), a junior, and 
Mike Ewalt (6-4, 160), a side-arm senior, were the junior varsity's top 
pitchers last season. Junior third baseman Alex Megas (5-7, 145) pitched and 
played shortstop for the junior varsity. Junior first baseman Mike Campbell 
(6-1, 160), a potential power threat, moves up from the sophomore team. Junior 
Andy Young (5-10, 160), a right-handed reliever, batted .400 on the junior 
varsity last season. Senior outfielder Steve Bowler (5-10, 165) led the junior 
varsity with four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I've got a certain amount of optimism this year, but we could be real 
tough next year," Scott said. The Indians are inexperienced, but their pitching 
might surprise. "I'm being a little prejudiced," Scott said, "but I think Mike 
Rossiter will be one of the best juniors in the Valley." Defense will make or 
break Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bud Murray, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-7; tied for 1st in league at 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Indians arguably have the Valley's best starting rotation 
in senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine and junior right-hander Keith Halcovich, 
both returning starters. Murray called Lorraine (9-5, 2.18 ERA), who combines 
an 80-plus m.p.h. fastball and a good curve, the best left-hander he has 
coached. Halcovich (9-2, 1.28) might be even better. Senior right-hander Kevin 
Foderaro, who registered a late-season shutout and a save after moving up from 
the junior varsity, is the relief ace. Six starters graduated, but the Indians 
have talent where they need it. Line-drive hitting Lance Migita (.447, 13 
doubles, three triples, 31 RBIs) moves from outfield to second base. Shortstop 
Rob Davis (.426, 30 RBIs), like Migita, enters his fourth varsity season. 
Senior third baseman Chad Miyata and junior first baseman R. J. Simone, who 
missed last season because of a broken leg, round out the infield. Junior 
catcher Tom Wolff, who started on the junior varsity last season, replaces the 
departed Casey Burrill. The outfield is new and untested, featuring seniors 
Garrett Emeterio and Sean Buck, both up from the junior varsity, and senior Les 
Holmes, a varsity reserve last season. Sophomore Doug Distaso, the quickest of 
the crew, is the likely starter in center field. Juniors Damon Mori and Joey 
Freitas, as well as Halcovich, also will play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Murray is amazed at prognostications favoring Hart. Despite the loss 
of several key players, however, the Indians look a heap better than their 
league foes. "I don't know how they figure that," Murray said. "But I think the 
longer we play, the better we're going to get."

'70S ROCK GROUP PROVES NOT READY FOR '90S COMEBACK

"Are you ready, Steve?" No, Sweet's original bassist Steve Priest wasn't there 
Wednesday at the Strand when the group played its first Southern California 
show since 1982. He and original singer Brian Connolly had the good sense to 
leave the group years ago after its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
But don't put it past the remaining original members, guitarist Andy Scott and 
drummer Mick Tucker, to have hired a keyboardist named Steve just so they could 
re-create that classic "Are you ready?" intro to Sweet's best-known song, 
1975's "Ballroom Blitz." The pair (who come to the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano on Sunday) certainly showed no other evidence of class Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Tucker sported poofy hair and leather duds that would look silly on 
Sunset Strip kids 20 years their junior. And with singer Paul Day, bassist Mal 
McNulty and keyboardist Steve Mann on Wednesday, they played songs that sounded 
silly 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, 15 years ago, that was part of the group's charm. Looking back, 
Sweet's hard-rock-bubble-gum style (one critic termed it "Bazooka-rock") was 
the missing link between the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Twisted Sister, a 
prototype for the '80s pop-metal of Motley Crue, Quiet Riot and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
And truth be told, the group's best songs -- "Ballroom Blitz," "Action" and the 
teasingly bisexual (though sexist) "A.C.D.C." -- have weathered better than the 
band. Any one of them would make a nice hard-rock diversion on Rhino Records' 
"Have a Nice Day" '70s pop anthologies. But that's hardly enough to justify 
Wednesday's hapless display. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet plays Sunday night at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. Opening act is Stikkity. Tickets are $16.50. Call (714) 
496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet also plays tonight at Spice in Hollywood, Saturday at the Bacchanal in 
San Diego and Monday at the Hop in Riverside.

'TALKING TONY' MUSER SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE 
</P>

<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him "Talking Tony" Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser recently took 
three hours away from a pennant race to do something that always came naturally 
-- make people smile. But this was different. It wasn't a laughing matter, and 
nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55 percent of his body. He was delirious for more than 
a week, incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly 
inscribed in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major-league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated over and over again. "It takes a 
lot of hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. "We haven't seen him smile like 
that since he's been here," said physical therapist Linda French as Muser spoke 
with Mike Lorenzo, who is recovering from burns over 80 percent of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But, when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," said Lewis. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in an Orioles 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and was 
anxious to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," said Muser, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, "was the turning point of 
my mental turnaround. When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before. I thought I was a tough 
guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can be until 
you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience in the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," said 
Muser. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began dominating his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," Muser said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what 
I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser hit a chord when he left little doubt that he credits his recovery to the 
therapists who treated him, and the unique relationship he developed with other 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we had a nurse named Judy, we called her 'Iron Brush' and I don't 
even know her last name," said Muser. "I don't have to know her last name -- 
but she saved my life. When we left we got a piece of plywood and nailed an 
iron brush and a washcloth to it and gave it to her as a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
"We have one here, too," said Marshall. "Her name is Theresa, and she knows how 
much we appreciate her." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
said Muser. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing ... I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," said Muser. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

LAKERS FINALLY LOOK AT HOME ON THE 'ROAD'; 
</P>
<P>
THEY END LOSING STREAK BY BEATING CLIPPERS, 116-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There might as well have been a giant magnifying glass over the Sports Arena 
Sunday afternoon, for all the microscopic analysis that was going on during the 
Lakers' 116-95 victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the people-watching, matinee style, the focus of attention from the crowd 
of the 15,352 belonged to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his 2-week evaluation period to remain the Laker 
starting center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gene Shue and his daily evaluation period to remain as Clipper coach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streaks, on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
As for the latter, the Lakers (24-12) won on the road for the first time after 
8 straight defeats, a skid that had dragged out since Dec. 13. Meanwhile, the 
Clippers (10-26) suffered their ninth consecutive loss and 20th in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar was hardly the key, but his second-half play inside, when the 
Lakers turned a modest 65-57 halftime lead into an eventual 22-point cushion, 
was another bright spot for Laker Coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The much-scrutinized center, who came in averaging 9.4 points and 4.1 rebounds, 
finished at 12 and 5, respectively, while tying his season-high in minutes 
played, 31. He scored 10 of the points, on 5-of-10 shooting, and got all 5 
rebounds in his 18 second-half minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better now," Abdul-Jabbar said of his shooting touch. "I feel my 
shots will go in. Before, they just flew out of my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play the minutes, physically. Mentally, I think I've come up a step or 
two and I think I've been improving. I just haven't been used to being part of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to come back exactly when I (get the minutes). But I think I'm 
approaching it. Another game or so and I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Which is more than can be said for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
With Shue's job possibly hanging in the balance -- even though team owner 
Donald T. Sterling was out of town and president Alan Rothenberg was at home 
ill -- the Clippers played well enough in the first half before the Lakers made 
it a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Clippers played well above their recent standards in the first 
half, shooting 60.5% from the field, to trail by eight points. That they were 
falling behind, though playing good, said plenty about how the Lakers looked. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we were playing against the world champions," said Clipper guard 
Quintin Dailey, who scored 20 of his team-high 24 points in the first half. "We 
turned the ball over in key situations. And when you do that against the 
Lakers, they're off to the races." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shue, who may have coached his last game at the Sports Arena with the 
Clippers: "I thought the Lakers played great. In the first half, we played 
very, very well. As a matter of fact, I don't think we could play much better." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker lead increased steadily in the second half, to 20 points, then to 21 
and, finally, to 22, at 115-93, on Mark McNamara's layin with 48 seconds to 
play. Along the way, the Clippers had only 35 rebounds, a season low and an 
abysmal number by any standard. The Lakers had 53. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin had 13 rebounds and 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting. It was his 
fourth straight game of double-figure rebounds, and he is also averaging 16.8 
points in the last 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm getting back to the way I'm capable of playing," said Benjamin, 
who, for a change, is not one of the subjects under the microscope. "I was 
getting shifted around (between being a starter and a reserve), but now I'm 
coming back to where I was before being benched." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers looked like the Lakers of old on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was their second straight impressive performance. Last Friday in 
the Forum, they defeated Cleveland, the team with the National Basketball 
Assn.'s best record, 116-95. 
</P>
<P>
Five players scored in double figures against the Clippers, led by Byron 
Scott's 28 points, Magic Johnson's 22 (and 12 assists) and James Worthy's 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard Gary Grant missed his second straight game with a bruised right 
thigh. His status for Tuesday's game at Seattle is uncertain. . . . Tom 
Garrick, who has seen time at point guard with Grant's injury and inconsistent 
play, sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. X-rays 
will be taken today as a precautionary move, but his availability for the game 
against the SuperSonics is also unknown. . . . After a career high in points 
(35) and rebounds (20) in Friday's loss to Golden State, Clipper forward Ken 
Norman set another career best against the Lakers with 7 assists. . . . Laker 
Mychal Thompson, on this "road" game: "It was rough. There was adversity. I was 
hitting every light coming here. I couldn't believe it. A couple of police cars 
came flashing by, and I don't know what. . . . The scariest part is that I've 
got to drive back."

<P>
VOLLEYBALL: EIGHT COUNTRIES COMPETING IN MIKE O'HARA'S EFFORT TO PUT SPOTLIGHT 
ON ATHLETES IN NON-OLYMPIC YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike O'Hara, the sports promoter who helped develop the American Basketball 
Assn., the World Hockey Assn. and professional track, has a vision: 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is meeting the Soviet Union in the championship match of the 
World (Volleyball) League and the Forum is sold out. A billion people, watching 
on a worldwide TV network, see Scott Fortune hit the winning point for the U.S. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm? Sounds as if O'Hara, a former UCLA volleyball star, got spiked in the 
head one too many times. But they laughed when O'Hara devised the three-point 
shot for the American Basketball Assn., the World Hockey Assn. began signing 
underaged players such as Wayne Gretzky and Pro-Track started paying runners. 
</P>
<P>
The ABA, WHA and Pro-Track were each making money when O'Hara left, and he 
predicts that the World League, which begins play Sunday at the Forum, will 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the things I've been involved in, I've never seen a league that has 
started with the credibility, experience and capital that this league has," 
O'Hara said. "Usually you sweat out the first year." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Hara isn't sweating. 
</P>
<P>
The World League has a $4-million budget, of which $3 million will be 
underwritten by corporate sponsors and $1 million by TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBA didn't start out this well," O'Hara said. "The NFL didn't start out 
this well. All those leagues started out real shaky, but people forget about 
their humble beginnings." 
</P>
<P>
Is the world ready for the World League? 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense from a business and marketing standpoint. SportsChannel, which 
will televise the U.S. matches, is a cable network hungry for quality 
programming. And volleyball, which all but disappears in non-Olympic years, 
needs the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, who hit the winning shot in the gold-medal match in the 1988 Olympics, 
predicts success for the World League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be really big, especially in America," Fortune said. "The 
world championships are big in a lot of countries, but Americans don't really 
follow volleyball until the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara has experience promoting volleyball, having run the Team Cup volleyball 
league at the Forum since 1984. Team Cup matches average 2,000 fans with the 
finals drawing 5,000. O'Hara hopes to expand on the base of Southland 
volleyball fans. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league has already met its budget, it could be be a hard sell in 
Southern California because the six-week season, which runs from April to June, 
conflicts with the NBA playoffs. Although the World League will move to the 
summer next year, the initial season was set for this spring so it wouldn't 
conflict with the World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we struggle this year, I think we'll be successful next year because 
we won't be competing against the Lakers," said John Root, a member of the 1988 
U.S. Olympic team. "All we have to do is go up against baseball." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara said: "The break-even point from a league standpoint has already been 
assured. Each of the teams will look to gate receipts and local sponsorships. 
The jury is still out on how we're going to do this year. I'd be delighted if 
we broke even." 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of O'Hara and Laker owner Jerry Buss, the World League is 
composed of the national volleyball teams from eight countries: the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Brazil, China, France, Italy, Japan and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctioned by the International Volleyball Federation, the league hopes to add 
four teams next year: Cuba, Canada, Argentina and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The eight teams are divided into two divisions, with the United States grouped 
with France, Italy and Brazil. Each team will play 12 matches, six home and six 
away, during the season. The top two teams from each division will meet in a 
four-match championship final in Osaka, Japan, July 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will receive a total of $1 million in prize money. Teams receive 
$1,500 for each match they win, $1,000 for each loss. The division champions 
will receive $80,000, with second place worth $60,000, third place $40,000, and 
fourth place $30,000. The playoff champion will win $140,000, with the 
second-place team getting $110,000, the third-place team $80,000 and the 
fourth-place team $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are also individual prizes. The league's most valuable player will get 
$15,000, with $10,000 prizes to be awarded the best spiker, best blocker, best 
setter and best defensive player. The outstanding referee will receive $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. volleyball team, who earn an average stipend of $1,500 per 
month, like the league's monetary rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national team, which requires a full-time commitment, has been losing 
its best players to Italian club teams, which offer six-figure salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians have upped volleyball to a different level with the money they're 
paying now," said Fortune. "It's real difficult for (the United States) to deal 
with because we don't have the money or the sponsors to pay the players to stay 
around instead of going to Italy." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is rebuilding after the retirement of Karch Kiraly and Steve 
Timmons, who led the team to gold medals in the last two Olympics. Three other 
players have left the national team to play in Italy: Jeff Stork, the starting 
setter on the U.S. team since 1985; Bob Ctvrtlik, who was voted best defensive 
player at the 1988 Olympics, and Adam Johnson, a former USC standout who was 
voted 1986 NCAA player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, the youngest player on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, and Root, a reserve 
on that team, rejected offers from Italian teams to remain with the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us still have something to prove," Root said. "But in light of the 
fact that they're (the United States Volleyball Federation) giving us the 
option of going to Italy and coming back over (to join the 1992 Olympic team), 
a lot of the guys are going to take advantage of that option." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kiraly and Timmons were listed on the U.S. roster for the World 
League, they will not compete this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the heart and soul of the team," Fortune said. "I talked to Steve 
and he said that before the U.S. became a good team they went through a real 
difficult period, which is what we're going through now. We have a bunch of 
young kids who are trying to come together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Root: "We have to find new players we can focus on and build a campaign 
around. Scott and I have been around the longest and hopefully we can provide 
the leadership that the coaches are looking for to bring the young guys 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the players are young. 
</P>
<P>
With the departure of Stork, the U.S. team's biggest problem was finding an 
experienced setter. The problem was solved by coaxing Rod Wilde out of 
retirement. Wilde, 34, had coached at Pepperdine since suffering a leg injury 
that knocked him out of the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, who coached against many of the players on the team, is adjusting to 
being a player again. He is 12 years older than the average age of the players. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Johnson also created a void at outside hitter, which will be filled 
by Root, who has been used primarily as a middle blocker. The other starting 
outside hitter is Troy Tanner, who led Pepperdine to NCAA titles in 1985 and 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune and Mark Arnold are expected to start at middle blocker, and Chris 
Braun will start at opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition in the United States' division is expected to come 
from Italy, which won the 1989 European Championship and finished second behind 
Cuba at the 1989 World Cup. The Soviet Union is favored in the other division.

RILEY SAYS LAKERS NOT MAKING THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You probably thought the Lakers were playing well this season. Their 21-6 
record indicates as much. Opponents have offered unsolicited praise. Most in 
the media have lauded their effort. 
</P>
<P>
But is Coach Pat Riley satisfied? Not according to a statistical evaluation he 
and his staff gave to Laker players before their final practice of 1989 on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that starters and reserves alike are not producing strong enough 
individual statistics in the usual areas -- field goal percentage, rebounding, 
turnovers, steals and assists -- compared to previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all down," Riley said. "Overall, from a number standpoint, our top 
four guys (Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Byron Scott and A.C. Green) are all 
down at least 12 to 18% from last year in some areas and are down a hell of a 
lot more from their best years. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of our players is down in certain areas we think are important. 
We've tried to establish some guidelines for them to shoot for, but it's up to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals have to want to keep striving. If they're just content with 
winning, then they may not have individual success. The team will carry them. 
But if they can get into increasing their performance, it'll help the team that 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riley: "The individual player has to be most responsible for his 
individual play across the board. Getting 22 points and 10 rebounds a game -- 
that means nothing to me. They've got to try to develop some consistency in 
their total game. They need to know these things. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can just improve 1% (individually) in a number of these areas . . . 
That 1% could be five-tenths of a rebound or one-tenth of a steal (per game). 
You multiply that 1% by 12 (players), you'll get a significant improvement in 
team performance." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players have come to expect such scrutiny of their performances from 
Riley. His New Year's Day report card -- they reportedly used to include letter 
grades, but no longer -- has been a standard for the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they expected a poor report, since the team field goal percentage 
and points per game have dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to it," Johnson said. "If we didn't have this report card, 
everybody would be looking at (Riley) funny. You're always looking for those 
notes he sends us in the summer and these marks. You always know where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Before talking in generalities about his players' deficiencies, Riley outlined 
his statistical formula. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the (individual) stats from the last three years and their individual 
best year (if it is a different season), then we showed them the team's best 
year, which was (1984-85)," Riley said. "And that's what we've compared to this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' four "core" players -- Johnson, Worthy, Scott and Green -- are down 
in several areas, according to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's combined shooting percentage in the four seasons Riley mentioned was 
51.1% This season, Scott has made 45.2% of his shots. Scott had averaged 18.5 
points in the four seasons; 16.1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Byron's shooting percentage is down, and he knows he needs to improve on 
that," said Riley, who added that Scott's rebounding and assists totals are 
slightly down from his best season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "What it is is a friendly reminder of what you're doing out there. 
It doesn't put pressure on you, but it lets you know. Numbers don't lie. I 
mean, you can get 20 points, but not have a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Green, according to Riley, needs to work on his field goal percentage, assists 
and also reduce his fouls. Green's rebounding average has improved from 8.5 a 
game in the four seasons in question to 9.4 this season. But his fouls have 
risen from 2.3 a game to 2.7, and his blocked shots are down to 0.74 from a 
career high of 1.01 in 1986-87. "Across the board, A.C. has to improve in each 
area except his rebounding, which is good," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "I think it's a good evaluation tool. Coach Riley points out those 
things so that you're aware of it. If I can improve 1% in each area, I'll be 
that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Worthy, the two most reliable Lakers, also saw a few statistical 
areas highlighted with a marking pen on their report cards. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's steals are down from 1.2 over the four-season span to 0.88 this 
season. His shooting percentage has dropped 3% and his turnovers have increased 
to 2.3 from a low of 1.9 in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the faults Riley found in his game were his field goal percentage 
of 47.1 this season compared to 51.9 in the four seasons, and his 88.8 
free-throw percentage compared to his NBA-best 91.1% last season. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things you still have to improve on as a player," Worthy said. 
"There's a lot of little things, like turnovers. Everybody on the team has a 
category, steals for me. I've got to get my turnovers down to like it was in 
(the 1985-86 season). I've also got to foul less." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "(Riley) wants my shooting percentage better. He says I'm good 
inside, but it's on the perimeter where I got to improve. The other thing is 
free throws, but I know I'll improve that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard NBA statistics, the Laker staff charts such obscure 
categories as players' shooting accuracy from different spots on the court. 
Center Mychal Thompson, the fifth Laker starter, said every category on his 
report card was highlighted for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," Thompson said. "No matter how long I stayed out of school, 
I still get failing grades. I never made the dean's list in college. But I 
don't care. Just once, I'd like to make Riley's list." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, takes these motivational tools seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to make or break them, in terms of playing time," Riley said of 
the performance reviews. "But they know it's important. They were nodding at 
me, as if saying, 'You're right.' Well, let's see some results now."
