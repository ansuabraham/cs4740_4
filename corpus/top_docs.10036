   From Mr LEO HERZEL


Sir, In your editorial, 'Hurry home, Mr Bush' (January 8), you quite
properly caution against Japan-bashing in the US. You then go on to
criticise chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in the US as too high
in comparison to CEO salaries in Japan, as follows: 'The fact that the
average US CEO earns 125 times the annual remuneration of a manufacturing
worker, compared to just 16 times in Japan, is one indication of the
contrast.'
The reasoning behind this criticism appears to be that Japanese
manufacturing companies are more successful in global markets than US
manufacturers; CEO compensation in Japan is lower than CEO compensation in
the US; therefore, lower CEO compensation in the US would be better.
This is a highly doubtful recommendation for the US and probably also for
the UK. It is true that unsuccessful CEOs in the US are paid too much and,
even more important, are allowed to stay on too long. On the other hand,
there are good reasons for believing that successful CEOs in the US usually
are paid too little. The problem in the US is that CEO compensation and
retention in employment generally do not respond enough to performance.
Some simple examples should make these points clearer. Top opera stars,
virtuoso violinists and orchestra conductors are paid huge amounts because
even very small differences in performance can result in very large
differences in economic outcomes for music promoters.
CEOs, because of the economically crucial nature of their jobs, have a much
more important effect on society. Stockholders and society in the US and UK
probably would benefit enormously from paying successful CEOs more and
eliminating unsuccessful ones more quickly. A similar point of view is
presented in more detail with some highly revealing statistics on the
subject in CEO incentives - it's not how much you pay but how, by Michael C.
Jensen and Kevin G. Murphy in the Harvard Business Review, May-June, 1990.

PERSONALITY: NEW CEO AT OFFICE AUTOMATION 




By CAROLINE LEMKE 




Joel Shusterman has been appointed president at Office Automation Systems, a 
San Diego-based laser printer manufacturer. He replaces Peter M. Steiner, who 
recently resigned to pursue a business opportunity in Northern California. 


Shusterman, 51, comes to Office Automation with more than 20 years of 
experience in the computer industry. After earning an electrical engineering 
degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia, he got his first job with 
Philco, designing circuits. 


Most recently, Shusterman was vice president of marketing with Commodore 
Business Machines. He has also held management positions with Burroughs Corp., 
Sanders Associates and General Electric. 


In 1977, at the beginning of the personal computer industry, Shusterman 
co-founded Franklin Computer Corp. and came out with a series of computers 
closely emulating the Apple personal computer. By 1984, Franklin was ranked the 
nation's seventh-largest personal computer company. 


In 1983, Computer Reseller News named Shusterman among the 25 most influential 
people in the computer industry. "It was the same month Franklin pushed me 
out," Shusterman recalled. 


"That's the irony of this business," he said. "As CEO at Franklin, I thought 
that success would be measured by great revenues and large profits, but that's 
not always the case." 


Shusterman says he looks forward to working with the staff at Office Automation 
and is impressed by the existing talent. "This company is really like a 
well-constructed ship sitting in the middle of an ocean that just doesn't have 
the head of steam," he said. 


"The ship is sound, but it was drifting, it had no direction," he said. "I have 
to aim the company where its strengths are. One of my major functions is to 
find that formula for success." 


From his early days working in the home radio laboratory at Philco, Shusterman 
has developed a love of old radios from the 1920s and '30s, and he spends much 
of his spare time restoring them. He is also an avid history buff. CAROLINE

A WHOLE NEW BREED OF CEO RUNS THE BIG BUSINESSES; 


MANAGEMENT: LISTENING TO PEOPLE, KNOWING WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS, AND MAKING THEM 
FEEL RESPECTED AS INDIVIDUALS IS ESSENTIAL, A CEO ADVISES. 




By MIKE BARLOW, STAMFORD ADVOCATE 




Autocrats, tyrants and eye-gougers are a vanishing breed on the American 
corporate landscape, according to top executives at several major firms. 


The notion that a successful corporate chief must be a modern day Genghis Khan, 
as suggested by former Gannett CEO Al Neuharth in his book, "Confessions of an 
S.O.B.," is simply not accurate, they say. 


"It won't work here," says George B. Harvey, chairman, president and chief 
executive officer of Pitney Bowes Inc. "The employees would throw you out." 


Successful CEOs recognize that satisfying the needs of company employees can be 
just as important as satisfying the demands of stockholders and customers, 
Harvey says. 


"You've got to listen to people, know what's on their minds and what they worry 
about," he says. To a greater degree than ever before, corporate employees 
"want to feel respected" as individuals. 


The key to productivity at Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney Bowes, a company that 
reported $2.6 billion in revenues last year, is synergy, not adversity. 


"I don't like 'creative tension,' " says Harvey, referring to a management 
style that pits employees against one another. "People ought to be free and 
willing to express their views. . . . Any manager that doesn't solicit ideas 
from everyone is making a big mistake." 


James P. Schadt, president and chief executive officer of Cadbury Schweppes 
Beverages in Stamford, appears to take that philosophy a step further. Because 
his company competes with corporate monsters like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Schadt 
encourages his managers to think creatively and act quickly. That's the best 
way for a company like Cadbury Schweppes to score hits on its larger opponents 
in the marketplace, he believes. 


"The only weapon we have is our people. . . . My job is to make people feel 
secure so they'll be creative and open with their ideas," he says. "In our 
company, no one ever gets punished for being open." 


The price of this freedom, however, is a heavier load of personal 
responsibility. "If I ever hear someone say, 'I could have told you that would 
happen,' I will do what I have to do and that person won't be in the company," 
Schadt says. 


Like Harvey, he frowns on internal politicking. But that doesn't rule out 
competition between managers. In fact, a degree of intramural competition is 
essential because the company owns several competing brands of soft drinks. 


What prevents this sort of competition from turning ugly is a clear set of 
corporate values spelled out in a little white manual entitled "The Character 
of the Company." 


In addition to fostering a sense of fair play, the manual serves as a good 
recruiting tool for Schadt. The company's size (it recorded $1.1 billion in 
sales last year, contrasted with $8.3 billion for Coca-Cola) prevents Schadt 
from offering prospective executives mega-salaries or huge departmental budgets 
to play with. "They come here because they want to be here, in our culture. 
It's not just another job," Schadt says. 


Because today's employees are better educated and more demanding than their 
predecessors, corporate leaders need a whole new set of skills to motivate 
them. 


"The key things are communication and concern," says David E. A. Carson, chief 
executive officer of Bridgeport, Conn.-based People's Bank, a $6.3-billion, 
multiservice financial institution. "No organization that intends to be around 
for a while forgets its people." 


In an age of rapid-fire mergers and overnight acquisitions, a CEO's reputation 
for honesty and sensitivity can prevent valuable employees from jumping ship 
when most needed. "The worst announcement you can make to employees is that 
nothing is going to change," says Carson, noting that People's Bank has been 
through six mergers in the last decade. 


Candor is paramount when competing in a rapidly changing marketplace, many 
believe. In a recent article in the Harvard Business Review, John F. Welch Jr., 
chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric, stresses the 
importance of facing reality, rather than denying or hiding it. 


"We've had managers at GE who wouldn't change . . . ," he says. "They wanted to 
sit back, to keep things the way they were. And that's just what they did -- 
until they and most of their staffs had to go. That's the lousy part of this 
job." 


Welch, whose company reported revenues of $50 billion last year, says that many 
managers are still afraid to let go of the bureaucracy that cushioned them in 
the past. "Real leaders don't need clutter. You can't believe how hard it is 
for people to be simple." 


Gone forever are the days when a corporate boss could fly by the seat of his 
pants, relying on personal experience and gut instinct to safely guide his 
decisions. 


Today's CEO is "a professional manager, not a hip-shooter," says William J. 
Alley, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of American Brands in 
Old Greenwich, Conn. A former U.S. Air Force captain, Alley now pilots a 
company that had revenues of $12 billion last year. 


Alley believes that consistency is the prime ingredient in the recipe for 
modern CEOs. "If they're going to be a tyrant or a nice guy, they've got to be 
consistent one way or the other," Alley says, offering two successful generals, 
George C. Marshall and George S. Patton, as examples. "Marshall was a nice guy 
all the time; Patton was a tyrant all the time." 


The ability to play the role of a leader is also indispensable. "You can't ask 
someone to do something you would not do yourself. It's very difficult to set a 
standard you don't maintain yourself. . . . If I want people to be on time, I'd 
better be on time." 


Setting appropriate standards of behavior and performance are part of the 
challenge of modern management, most executives agree.

LOOKING AHEAD: CHIEF EXECUTIVES WILL NEED GLOBAL VIEW IN THE 1990S 




By PETER G. VAJTA, PETER G. VAJTA is the director of the Los Angeles office of 
Arthur D. Little Inc., an international management and technology consulting 
firm headquartered in Cambridge, Mass. 




America's chief executive, President Bush, has gained considerable mileage from 
his vision of a "kinder, gentler nation." CEOs of American business, however, 
should prepare for a tougher, more turbulent marketplace in the decade ahead. 


The men and women who pilot American companies in the 1990s aren't likely to be 
any smarter or more ambitious than their current counterparts. But tomorrow's 
superior companies will be led by a new breed of chief executive -- one who is 
knowledgeable on global issues and their application to marketing strategy, is 
adept at anticipating change, acts swiftly and communicates those insights and 
actions to employees and shareholders. 


Five major challenges confront the CEO of the '90s: 


Acting globally: In the '80s, only the brightest American corporate leaders 
considered the global market for their business. In the '90s, corporate leaders 
can't just think globally, they must act globally, and in every aspect of their 
businesses. In fact, CEOs who have not yet addressed the impact and 
opportunities of global markets in corporate planning are already lagging 
behind their competition. 


Many companies today pay lip service to being multinational when, in fact, they 
are actually a cluster of unrelated worldwide entities contributing to the same 
bottom line. To leverage off the global presence of their companies, CEOs must 
forge a unification of disparate company entities while recognizing the 
peculiarities of the individual markets. 


The Pacific Rim emerged in the '80s as a source of competition and a trove of 
opportunities for U.S. business. The unification of the European Community in 
1992 also presents comparable opportunities, to say nothing of a rapidly 
opening Eastern Europe. The smartest CEOs must thoroughly understand the 
cultural and business differences among -- and in -- each of these foreign 
markets. 


The best CEOs will recognize the potential of millions of consumers and vast 
raw materials in these markets. Thoroughly assessing foreign markets and 
developing new ways of doing business in foreign operations will be 
prerequisites for success. 


Using technology to gain competitive advantage: The implementation of 
information technology is changing the way companies operate today. However 
technology is used, it will play a critical role in a company's success or 
failure. CEOs must consider advanced technology not as an added luxury but as a 
necessity. 


Effectively competing in the global arena will require integrating technology 
into all aspects of a company's operations, with a corporate commitment to 
maintaining sophistication. 


Competing against non-traditional forces: Competition will emerge not only from 
foreign markets but also from the new companies formed by mergers and 
acquisitions. In addition, companies that were once customers may become 
competitors. 


With few exceptions, industry leaders in the '90s will not be well served by 
competing on price alone. Quality -- in both products and services -- will 
become an essential way that companies will attempt to differentiate 
themselves. Many firms today have established mandates to improve quality at 
every level in the company. Motorola, Xerox and Westinghouse Electric, for 
example, have been nationally recognized for achieving progress through a 
top-down commitment to quality. 


Approaching the new labor force: The CEO's role as coach and manager will 
evolve in the next decade as he or she tries to direct, without dissuading, a 
new breed of manager that is more entrepreneurial in nature. As the corporate 
organizational structure of the '90s becomes increasingly flat, CEOs must be 
able to effectively direct fewer management levels with more multifunctional 
positions. 


The changing profile of the American family and the average life style will 
also necessitate how the CEO views the work force. The way that the CEO 
addresses such issues as child care, parental leave, flex-time schedules and 
fitness facilities will affect the loyalty of all ranks within organizations. 


Changing the profile of mergers and acquisitions: Mergers and acquisitions will 
continue, but progressive CEOs will increasingly look to those that enhance 
existing capabilities or provide access to new markets and services. As 
business leaders wisely move away from the "scorched earth" cost-cutting 
policies of the '80s, the measure of corporate financial performance will shift 
from short-term profit gains to the improvement of company and shareholder 
value created by strategically formed alliances. 


The most effective CEOs will be those who recognize the priority of identifying 
value in their companies. They will concentrate on profitable activities while 
reducing marginal business. They will set ambitious yet obtainable goals and 
will communicate their progress and optimism to the financial community and 
employees. 


To say that the role of the CEO in the '90s will be more difficult may be a 
gross understatement. What is certain is that corporate success will depend on 
the CEO's ability to adapt effectively to a rapidly changing business 
environment.

is marketed with the global approach that will become increasingly important 
for executives in the 1990s. Associated Press

General Electric Co. of Britain and U.S.-based General Electric Co. said they 
plan to merge their European consumer products, medical equipment and some 
electrical divisions. The U.S.-based GE plans to pay the British-based firm 
$579 million (325 million pounds) in cash as part of the merger of their

and comes out in front. A case in point is Miklos Csapody, the Hungarian
executive just designated director of technology for the US General
Electric's subsidiary, GE Lighting Europe.
It is three years since GE acquired Tungsram, the former state-owned
Hungarian lightbulb-maker, thus inheriting Csapody who had been with the
company since starting work as an electrician. Following the takeover, the
westerners gave the instructions, he says.
But the positions have been reversed by the shake-up in GE Lighting Europe
aimed at integrating Tungsram with the lighting business bought from the
UK's Thorn EMI. Csapody has emerged from the revolving door ahead.
The self-assured 53-year-old, who learnt English by reading Oscar Wilde at
home, becomes responsible for research centres in Leicester and Enfield in
the UK, as well as in his native Hungary. His position is probably the
highest any native east European has risen within a western multinational.
A sheltered east European managerial upbringing can occasionally be a boon.
Csapody says he did not quake when he first met Jack Welch, GE's formidable
CEO . . .before admitting: 'I didn't know enough about him to be scared.'

    Nuclear Energy Program Suspended for Five Years

BFN 

 [Report by special correspondent in Birmingham Jean-Francois 
Polo: "Declining French Electricity Requirements -- French 
Electricity Company Will Order No Nuclear Plant in Next Five 
Years"] 
  [Excerpts] The French nuclear energy program has just 
suffered a setback. Aware of the low increase in electricity 
demand in mainland France as well as the high productivity rate 
of its power plants, EDF [French Electricity Company] will place 
no new order for nuclear reactors for at least five years, CEO 
Francois Ailleret announced in Birmingham on the occasion of the 
23d UNIPEDE congress, which brings together Europe's major 
electricity companies. 
  It is the first time that such a long suspension has been 
decided since France launched its large-scale nuclear program 20 
years ago. This decision may cause problems for boiler 
manufacturer Framatome, which had been hoping for an order from 
EDF by 1997 and which will have to make do with maintenance work 
to maintain its know-how. 
  The nuclear industry is not the only one hit by the slower 
growth in power requirements. According to EDF, which reviewed 
the matter at its board meeting last Friday [17 June], there is 
"no need to order any new power generation equipment, whether 
nuclear or not, before the end of the decade, except for Corsica 
and overseas territories." 
  Scheduled to invest 38.9 billion francs [Fr] this year, 
including Fr7.5 billion for nuclear power generation, Fr.7.5 
billion for power transmission, and Fr16.1 billion for power 
distribution, EDF has decided to order only two gas turbines 
instead of a an anticipated six. As for power export levels 
(currently at 63 billion kilowatt-hour [kWh]), they are expected 
to increase only slightly, to 70 billion kWh, within 10 years. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, EDF's CEO indicated that the public utility is 
ready to pay "a significant amount" to fund the closure of the 
Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to Mr. Ailleret, 
"the odds are better than ever" that reactor number one will be 
shut down by this winter, with the rest of the plant being shut 
down within two or three years, when construction currently 
under way has been completed. The reported cost of the closure 
program is about Fr10 billion.

Varig, Latin America's largest airline, has proposed offering board seats to
McDonnell Douglas and General Electric in return for their help with its
financial restructuring.
The Brazilian carrier said it had signed letters of intent with the two US
companies to restructure its payments to Eximbank of the US for aircraft.
Varig owes Eximbank more than Dollars 600m.
A board seat will be given to Varig's Brazilian creditor banks and one more
will be decided by Varig, McDonnell Douglas and General Electric. The other
five board seats will remain under Varig's control.
Varig said the proposals did not involve changes in the shareholding of the
airline, which is controlled by an employees' foundation.
General Electric has agreed to buy Varig's six Boeing 767 aircraft, which
had been purchased with Eximbank funding, for Dollars 204m. Varig will
continue to use the aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, which sold Varig four MD-11 aircraft, will pay the
principal on the debt for the next 18 months, totalling Dollars 72m, while
Varig will continue to pay the interest.

General Electric of the US yesterday confirmed that it was interested in
acquiring a stake in Lindner, the German-based light-bulb maker.
General Electric's renewed interest in the company followed a decision
earlier this week by Germany's Federal Cartel Office to reject a proposed
takeover of Lindner by Philips, the Dutch-based manufacturer of light bulbs.
The cartel office argued the proposed takeover would strengthen Philips'
dominant position in the German market. Along with Osram, a subsidiary of
Siemens, Philips holds 80 per cent of the German light bulb market.
Philips yesterday said the company had not decided whether to appeal against
the decision at the Kammergericht, Germany's appeal court.
The cartel office ruling could clear the way for GE. It said it had an
interest in Lindner. Previous talks between the two ended by mutual
agreement in October 1993.
GE said Germany was a 'strategic and important market for all of General
Electric'. Last year's turnover in the country's lighting market totalled
Dollars 600m.
General Electric Lighting, the German subsidiary of GE, has 9 per cent of
the German market.

good relationship between the chief executive and the IT director. It is now
generally accepted that a successful relationship is a key factor in the
effective exploitation of IT. Yet the study found that:
A background in marketing or general management is more likely to lead a
chief executive to an effective 'vision' of the value of IT than hands-on
experience. This contradicts the view that top managers would only come to
appreciate IT if they had practical experience.
IT directors with a background in data processing are more likely to form a
successful relationship with their CEOs than business line managers placed
in top IT management jobs. This might seem obvious; but there is a
well-known 'culture gap' between computing specialists and line managers.
It is not necessary for the IT director to report directly to the CEO as
long as he or she is part of the top management team.
The study, carried out by David Feeny and colleagues at Templeton College,
was carried out under the Impact Programme, now sponsored by KPMG Management
Consultants.
The study suggests that a successful relationship between CEO and IT
director derives from a common vision of computing as a way of conferring
competitiveness on an organisation rather than merely automation and
efficiency.
The relationship can be improved if the CEO sets aside time to explain his
attitude to the IT director, if the IT director is a member of the company's
'cabinet' and if the two executives spend time away from the office
discussing business goals.

BRIEFLY 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




Payments by Van Nuys Firm, GE Ordered: A jury directed General Electric Co. to 
pay $70.8 million to American Aviation Industries Inc. of Van Nuys for 
breaching a contract between the two, American Aviation said. 


The jury, however, also ordered American Aviation to pay $9.8 million to GE and 
its General Electric Capital Corp. finance subsidiary. The money is mostly to 
repay loans from General Electric Capital to American Aviation, the company 
said. The lawsuits stem from a venture under which American Aviation and GE 
were to retrofit Lockheed JetStar corporate jets with GE-made CF34 turbofan 
engines.

NOT EVERY CEO'S TAKE-HOME PAY IS SO AWESOME 




By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Keizo Yoshida is the top officer of Sumitomo Bank of California, a big, 
profitable institution. Yet with an annual pay package worth $210,400, he earns 
only a fraction of what executives at similar banks take home. 


Yoshida isn't destitute, of course. But neither is he unique. Even as big money 
gets all the headlines, a surprising number of top executives are paid 
relatively modestly. 


The Times took a look at the 20 lowest-paid chief executives of California's 
largest publicly held companies -- those with sales exceeding $250 million. Not 
one of the men made more than $406,000, and Yoshida was the lowest paid among 
them. By contrast, the highest-paid executives running companies with revenues 
between $250 million and $500 million earned between $940,000 and $4.5 million. 


Yoshida's relatively low pay illustrates the huge difference between the lavish 
pay scales for American managers and the more modest ones for Japanese 
executives. As a Japanese citizen running a Japanese-owned California bank, 
Yoshida gets paid according to Japanese practices. In the Japanese automobile 
industry, for example, a chief executive's pay on average is 20 times that of a 
blue-collar worker. In the U.S. auto industry, the ratio is 192 to 1. 


Others on the low-pay list suffered because of poor profits at their companies. 
In many instances, executives take low salaries and rely on building the value 
of large equity stakes in their companies. 


Managers with large ownership stakes in the firms they run often feel that 
their interests are better served by plowing profits back into the company 
rather than pouring them into their personal checking accounts, said Donald L. 
Lowman, principal at Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby in Los Angeles. 


In fact, more than half the executives on the "low-paid" list own between 1% 
and 60% of the common stock in their firms. Some say their take-home pay is not 
that important. 


"I went for seven years without a raise," said Gerald Barton, chief executive 
of Landmark Land Co. in Carmel. Why? "I'm the one who recommends raises for the 
rest of the staff, and I'm obviously not going to recommend my own. I think the 
directors just forgot about me." 


Of course, Landmark has seen better days. The company lost $34.9 million in 
1989, compared to a $16-million profit in 1988. And savings and loan regulators 
blocked the $967-million sale of several of the company's resort properties. 
Landmark has since hired Salomon Bros. to find a buyer. 


At Silicon Graphics, Chief Executive Edward R. McCracken's pay can be explained 
by the company's philosophy, said Mark Perry, executive vice president. The 
Mountain View, Calif.-based computer firm is one of the fastest growing in the 
nation, Perry noted. That's partly because officers take relatively low base 
salaries in exchange for stock options. 


The company then has more working capital, and the officers have the 
opportunity to reap tremendous rewards when the stock rises rapidly. So far 
they haven't cashed in. When they do, their compensation will rise 
dramatically. 


"Our stock was selling for $16 a year ago, and it's going for about $32 now," 
Perry said. "That would be a major element of compensation for somebody who 
owns shares." 


But not all are happy about their place on the low-pay list. 


"It's a dubious distinction," muttered Hal Ellis, chairman and chief executive 
of San Francisco-based Grubb &amp; Ellis, a diversified real estate firm. 


Ellis said he's on the list because his company's performance is not up to 
snuff, and the company adheres to a pay-for-performance plan. 


"If we achieved our profit goals for the year, some of us could have earned 
incentive compensation packages that would exceed 100% of salary," Ellis said. 
"But last year virtually none of my compensation was in incentives, and the 
same holds true for the year before because the company's profitability did not 
warrant incentive pay." 


Grubb &amp; Ellis earned $521,000 on revenue of $362 million in 1989. The year 
before, it lost $1.9 million on $374.7 million in revenue. 


"We have a strong upside when we can perform," Ellis said, bemoaning the real 
estate slump. "That will eventually change. But in the meantime, our 
compensation gives us every incentive to do all we can to positively affect the 
profitability of the company."

   NEW YORK


Ameritech, the Chicago-based telecommunications company, and General
Electric, the US conglomerate, are joining forces in a information services
business which will develop electronic commerce and inter-company
communications.
They announced yesterday that Ameritech would invest Dollars 472m in the
newly formed company, while GE would contribute the assets of its General
Electric Information Services division, which specialises in electronic data
exchange and electronic commerce.
The move came just 24 hours after Ameritech, in conjunction with its German
partner Deutsche Telekom, was selected to take a stake in Matav, the
Hungarian state telecoms concern, as part of eastern Europe's largest single
privatisation deal. Ameritech's stake will cost it Dollars 437.5m.
GE's information services division, which has revenues of Dollars 600m and
is based in Rockville, Maryland, was founded in the 1960s as a computer
time-sharing business and evolved into an electric commerce company in the
1980s when the personal computer revolution reduced demand for time-sharing.
The business helps companies exchange documents electronically with
suppliers and customers, increasing efficiency and eliminating paperwork. It
advises on internal company communications.
The new company initially will be wholly owned and operated by GE.
Ameritech's investment will be a four-year convertible note which will
convert into a 30 per cent equity stake when certain legal restrictions are
removed.

Territory, the largest unit in NAB, with more branches and greater assets
than Clydesdale. He took up office in Glasgow yesterday but will not move
from Sydney to Glasgow until the second half of February.
Love, who was 48, died suddenly during a skiing holiday in France. He had
been ceo at Clydesdale for little over a year having previously held senior
posts with TSB. He had recently launched a project to create two branch
banking processing centres and a telephone centre for the Clydesdale in
Scotland, a project which will involve up to 800 job losses but will not
mean closing branches.
Cicutto has been with NAB for 26 years. His recent appointments include
general manager of the group's credit bureau and head of the bank's US
operations, based in New York. He had not visited Scotland before this week.
Cicutto is the first Australian to be ceo of Clydesdale, which NAB acquired
in 1987 from the Midland Bank. All previous ceos have been British and there
are only a handful of Australians working in the bank. However, he says he
does not expect to encounter any hostility for not being Scottish and that
he intends to carry on with the strategy launched by Love. 'The direction is
very clear and I am very comfortable with it,' he says.

GE Aircraft Engines, an arm of the General Electric Company and a major
supplier to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers, said yesterday
it was cutting its workforce by more than 10 per cent.
The move, another symptom of the poor health of the US aircraft industry,
follows heavy job cuts by Boeing last week.
GE Aircraft, which sells engines for air, marine, and industrial use, said
it would cut 3,900 from its workforce of 33,000. The cuts are planned across
operations, with about 2,500 at its headquarters in Evendale, Ohio; 700 at
its plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, and 700 at smaller facilities around the
US.
In addition to an airline slump, GE Aircraft is also feeling the effects of
recent US military budget cuts.
'Our commercial customers have suffered unprecedented losses in the last
three years, and engine and spare parts orders are down,' said Mr Brian
Rowe, president. 'Those difficulties and continually changing customer needs
require these cost actions,' he said.
The company said the reductions would be made as much as possible through
attrition and voluntary job elimination programmes.
GE Aircraft Engines had revenues of Dollars 7.368bn (Pounds 5.18bn) in 1992,
compared with General Electric's overall sales of Dollars 62.2bn. A General
Electric spokesman said GE Aircraft had operating earnings of Dollars 7.7m
in 1992.
