  [Text] London, March 16--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today reaffirmed India's solemn commitment to 
fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the constitution and 
asserted that "there is no question of any going back on human 
rights of the individual citizens," reports PTI. 
  Speaking after paying his homage to the historic magna 
carta, 
a source of inspiration and a symbol of freedom under the law 
throughout the world, Mr Rao said the Indian constitution 
provides the individual freedoms in no uncertain terms and 
chapter three of the constitution on fundamental rights was full 
elaboration of the principles symbolised by the magna carta 
memorial. The memorial was erected at the spot at which King 
John and his barons put their seal to charter of magna carta 779 
years ago on June 15, 1215. 
  The Prime Minister unveiled a commemorative plaque and 
planted an English oak at the memorial on the bank of river 
Thames at Runnymede in Surrey about 25 km from here to mark 
significance of this symbol of freedom on India's development of 
democratic government. 
  Mr Rao briefly addressed the distinguished audience which 
had 
gathered at the memorial in the meadows of Surrey braving heavy 
showers and a mild hailstorm before the Prime Minister's 
arrival. The memorial was erected in 1957 by the American Bar 
Association whose central pillar bears the inscription "to 
commemorate magna carta, symbol of freedom under law." 
  The Indian Prime Minister is the second statesman after 
President, J.F. Kennedy to associate himself with the home of 
magna carta. 
  Mr Rao spoke about the human rights situation in India and 
said those in the administration knew how difficult it was for 
the government to conform to the stringent law of freedom in 
the Indian judicial system. "But we are doing and there is no 
question of going back on the fundamental freedom of the human 
rights of individual citizens." 
  Mr Rao ruled out India accepting any "regional" arrangement 
for nuclear non-proliferation and called for a global and 
non-discriminatory regime against proliferation. 
  "Proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity 
prevented without a global and non-discriminatory regime," Mr 
Rao told Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, during their 
30-minute meeting here on the third day of the Prime Minister's 
four-day official visit to the U.K. yesterday. 
  Aboard his aircraft, the Prime Minister said Britain's stand 
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "is not very far from 
ours." 
  On the British view on Kashmir, Mr Rao said that its 
position 
was not identical to India's "but on the whole it is not very 
far from our stand."

Language:  English

 [By Vicente B. Foz] 
  [Text] The provision of the Uruguay Round to which the 
Philippines committed, to convert quantitative restrictions on 
agricultural products into tariffs does not amend Republic Act 
No. 7606, known as the Magna Carta of Small Farmers. 
  This was the ruling made by Justice Secretary Franklin M. 
Drilon in reply to a query of Trade and Industry Secretary 
Rizalino S. Navarro. Drilon said "the Magna Carta provisions 
cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round." 
  While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the land 
in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been 
said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of 
international law will often be given effect in municipal courts 
since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it. 
  Citing the Salonga-Yap book on Public International Law, 
Drilon said, the fact that international law has been made part 
of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy 
of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere. 
  As retired Supreme Court Justice Edgardo J. Paras said in 
his 
work "International Law," in case of conflict between 
international law and the municipal law of the tribunal deciding 
the case, the municipal law shall prevail. 
  However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round 
is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the 
Constitution, "our reply to this particular query might be 
different if we are to consider and apply the American 
jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of 
Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may 
supersede a prior treaty." 
  Navarro also asked whether "non-implementation by the 
president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision 
of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest 
groups."

THREE senior executives who played a leading role in Magna International's
financial turnround are leaving to become full-time consultants.
But Magna, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, says it had signed
consulting contracts with all three.
The company said its focus was shifting to 'operational matters'.
Mr David Copeland, Mr James Nicol and Mr Werner Czernohorsky were
respectively chief financial officer, vice-president corporate development
and chief administrative officer. All three sat on a five-man executive
management committee set up in 1990 when Magna faced bankruptcy with growing
debt and sliding profits due to the recession.
Now Magna says it has drastically reduced debt and will resume 'disciplined
growth'. For the year ended July 31, profit was CDollars 98m (USDollars 79m)
on sales of CDollars 2.4bn.

MAGNA BACKERS INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD 




By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Four former promoters of a defunct Thousand Oaks company have been named in a 
42-count criminal indictment unsealed by a grand jury in Los Angeles Tuesday. 


The charges, stemming from the rapid rise and collapse of the stock of Magna 
Technologies in 1985, include multiple counts of conspiracy and securities and 
wire fraud. The indictment says Magna was a "shell corporation" with no assets 
that was used by the defendants to profit by manipulating its stock. 


Named in the indictment were Jacob Rubenstein, formerly of Woodland Hills; 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon who was Magna's chairman; 
Robert Victor of Las Vegas, and Herbert Stone, a former New York stockbroker. 
Rubenstein, Gutstein and Victor all held large blocks of Magna shares; Stone 
was the primary market maker for the stock. 


The indictment was returned by the grand jury March 7. 


Magna once claimed to have plans to market such unusual products as a 
45,000-volt "stun gun," an "insta-cup" to make instant soup, a device to help 
sexually impotent men and a hand-held, battery-powered pain reliever. 


John F. Walsh, assistant U.S. attorney, said Tuesday that the company "didn't 
produce any products" during the period identified in the indictment. 


Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four others were also named in a civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May, 1987, which accused 
them of manipulating Magna stock. The defendants entered summary judgments in 
which they did not admit or deny guilt but agreed to stop the activities cited 
in the suit. 


According to the indictment, Rubenstein and the others used fraudulent schemes 
to manipulate Magna's stock, including inducing friends and relatives to set up 
accounts to trade in Magna stock to create the impression of interest in the 
stock. However, Rubenstein and the others actually controlled the accounts, it 
says. 


The indictment also says the defendants ordered Magna stock without intending 
to pay for it -- a practice called "free-riding" -- and when actual investors 
tried to sell Magna stock, they refused or failed to execute the sell order. 
They also released false and misleading information about the company's 
products, it said. 


Magna's stock rose from 50 cents a share in March, 1985, to a peak of $9.50 in 
September, 1985. During that time, the defendants made more than $1 million in 
profits by selling their shares. Soon after, the stock collapsed and became 
virtually worthless. 


Walsh said Rubenstein is a fugitive. David L. Kagel, Rubenstein's former 
attorney, said he hadn't seen him in more than a year and didn't know where he 
was.

   TORONTO


MAGNA International, the Toronto-based automotive parts supplier, plans to
expand its European operations by investing about CDollars 100m (USDollars
76m) in an unidentified parts manufacturer.
Magna said yesterday that it was in talks which may result in it buying a
majority interest in an operating unit of the European group, and a minority
stake in a public company within the same group. It is also investigating
several other potential investments in Europe.
Magna officials declined yesterday to identify their target, beyond saying
that it is a large company. But Magna has a history of close co-operation
with German car and parts makers. It already has a 50 per cent stake in a
joint venture with Voest-Alpine of Austria which owns four parts factories
in Germany and Austria. Magna owns another factory of its own in Germany.
To finance the proposed acquisition, Magna also announced plans yesterday to
issue 3m common shares in the US and Canada at a price of CDollars 50.50 a
share. The issue will be underwritten in Canada by a group led by Richardson
Greenshields. Bids have been invited from US brokers.
Mr Paul Robinson, senior vice-president for finance, said the thrust into
Europe was prompted partly by potential benefits in the European market, but
also to cement 'stronger relationships with European customers as they move
into North America'. Magna already has contracts to supply BMW's new factory
in South Carolina.
Mr Robinson said the investment will also encourage a 'cross-fertilisation'
of technologies between European and North American auto-parts plants. A
substantial number of Magna's engineers and other senior managers are
Europeans.
Magna has recovered strongly from financial difficulties which pushed it
close to the brink in the late-1980s. It posted record profits of CDollars
140m on sales of CDollars 2.6bn in the year to July 31.
The share price dropped CDollars 1.25 in early trading yesterday on the
Toronto stock exchange to CDollars 52.25.

From October 1 next year the UK will move into line with the rest of the
European Union by adopting metric measures for most purposes. But beer and
cider will still be sold in pint rather than half-litre measures - provided
these are in returnable containers - while road signs will stay in miles
rather than kilometres.
Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday he had laid
before parliament statutory instruments to implement the European Units of
Measurement directive. But the legislation provided for a handful of the
most popular imperial measures - some first standardised just after the
signing of the Magna Carta - to continue to be used.
Past reluctance from the public and from traders to adopt metric measures
led to the UK being granted a special exemption from the weights and
measures directive.
However most goods that are not already sold in metric measures will have to
conform from next year.
The main exceptions will be foods such as meat, poultry, fish and cheese,
which are sold loose by the pound and ounce. These will not have to switch
to metric until 2000.
The imperial measures that will continue beyond that are the mile, yard,
foot and inch for road-traffic signs and distance and speed measurement; the
pint for milk, draught beer and cider sold in returnable containers; the
troy ounce for precious metals; and the acre for land registration.
Consumers fearing confusion should take heart. Retailers will display price
conversion charts for goods sold in metric quantities.

BROKER PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD IN MAGNA CASE; 


THOUSAND OAKS: HERBERT STONE HAS AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS 
NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE WILL TESTIFY AGAINST HIS CO-DEFENDANTS. 




By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




One of four defendants accused of stock fraud in a criminal indictment 
involving Magna Technologies, a defunct Thousand Oaks company, pleaded guilty 
in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday. 


Herbert Stone, a former securities broker who made a market in Magna's stock, 
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, seven counts of securities fraud and 
four counts of wire fraud. Each of the 12 counts carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1. 


Stone is currently serving a two-year sentence in federal prison for stock 
manipulation unrelated to Magna. 


Two of Stone's co-defendants, Robert Victor, a former Magna shareholder, and 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon and Magna's former chairman, 
have pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to go to trial Nov. 
27. Assistant U.S. Atty. John Walsh said Stone "has agreed with the government 
to cooperate," but it hasn't yet been determined whether he'll testify against 
Victor and Gutstein. 


A fourth defendant, Jacob Rubenstein, a shareholder and principal promoter of 
Magna, remains at large. 


Victor is a convicted felon formerly known as Robert Viggiano. He was referred 
to in police reports from the investigation of ZZZZ Best, the defunct Reseda 
carpet cleaning company, as "a reputed member of the Colombo organized crime 
family." During the securities fraud trial of ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow, 
defense attorneys said Victor, a ZZZZ Best shareholder, used threats and 
violence to force Minkow into the fraud. 


Victor was never charged with a crime relating to ZZZZ Best. Minkow was 
convicted in 1988 of 57 counts of fraud. 


The Magna indictment charged the co-defendants with 42 counts of conspiracy, 
and securities, wire, bank and tax fraud. Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four 
others were also accused of manipulating Magna stock in a related civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987. 


The defendants entered summary judgments in the civil suit, agreeing to stop 
the activities cited in the suit without admitting or denying guilt. 


The indictment said that in 1985 Magna was merged with Bashney Biscuit, a 
bankrupt, publicly traded corporation, thereby creating freely traded Magna 
stock without registering the stock with the SEC. 


The defendants then carried out a scheme to artificially inflate Magna's stock 
price, the indictment said. The company once boasted that it acquired the 
rights to such offbeat products as a flexible pouch for carrying liquids, a 
battery-operated "stun gun," a device to aid sexually impotent men and a 
hand-held, battery-operated "pain reliever." 


The government said no products were produced by Magna during the period named 
in the indictment. 


The indictment also said the defendants enlisted the aid of friends and 
relatives who set up accounts at brokerage firms to trade in Magna stock. Using 
these accounts, the defendants drove the stock price up using tactics such as 
"wash sales," in which a person buys and sells the same block of stock, 
"matched sales," which involves two people trading the same block of stock, and 
"free-riding," a technique of placing orders for stock without intending to pay 
for them, the indictment said. 


From March to September, 1985, Magna's stock climbed from 50 cents a share to 
$9.50 before collapsing. The indictment said the defendants made more than $1 
million through sales of Magna stock.

HE'LL TURN 90 DIRECTING 'WOYZECK' 




By JANICE ARKATOV 




"It took a long time, but I fell in love with the play," said Martin Magner of 
Georg Buchner's "Woyzeck" which opens this weekend, with a new translation by 
Carl R. Mueller, at the Harman Avenue Theatre in Hollywood. "I read it when I 
was a young man, but I've never directed it," added the German-born director, 
who'll turn 90 tomorrow. 


"I think it needs a certain maturity. Perhaps I'm approaching it." 


Written in 1836, Buchner's work -- which Magner points to as a predecessor of 
Wedekind's, Pinter's and Genet's -- has often found itself the subject of 
contemporary stagings. "It has so much to say to us today," the director said. 
"Somehow you don't feel it's been written many years ago. It is really the 
beginning of Expressionism in the world: an electrifying play, filled with 
progressiveness, humanity and compassion. It stands for the rights of man." 


But, for his 90th birthday, wouldn't Magner rather do something a bit more ... 
festive? "There's festivity in a good catharsis -- a cleansing of the mind," he 
said lightly. Magner, recipient of the 1989 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle 
Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award, added: "I wanted to do something that 
means something, that has gravity. I've done so much fluff in my life." JANICE

MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, tripled
fourth quarter net profits and expects to benefit from a 5 to 10 per cent
rise in north American car production in fiscal 1993.
Profits for the fourth quarter to July 31 were CDollars 31.3m (USDollars
25.8m), or 82 cents a share, up from Dollars 11.6m, or 41 cents a share, a
year earlier, on sales of Dollars 625m, up 16 per cent.
Two years after a brush with failure, the restructured Magna reported a
profit of Dollars 98m, or Dollars 2.91 a share for the full year, up sixfold
from Dollars 16.5m, or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 2.4bn, up 17 per cent.
Magna attributed the strength in sales to rising north American vehicle
output and growth in the company's average production content. Magna also
operates several European plants.
Profits gained from higher plant operating rates and lower interest costs.
Debt has been halved to Dollars 274m, including a Dollars 165m convertible
debenture.
Magna plans to apply for a New York Stock Exchange quotation. It is paying a
10 cents a share dividend on the A and B stock on October 16.
Lac Minerals, a Canadian gold producer, is buying 52 per cent of the high
grade Lisheen zinc-lead property near Kilkenny, in Ireland, from Chevron
Corp for USDollars 70m.

    `North's New Star' Profiled 
  94P2O253B 
 94P2O253B 





Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Called by Carlos Magno the "national 
figure of the year" in the 24 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
newly reelected Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, a Socialist Party 
(PS) luminary, is now generally seen as the North's "new star." 
According to Magno, Porto, which needed a leader in 1989 when 
Gomes was first elected, identified with the "technocratic 
discourse" of this economist and Eurodeputy possessing a "very 
short political resume." Following his election, Gomes was 
increasingly recognized as a "serious player." It was remembered 
that the late legendary PSD leader Sa Carneiro had asked him to 
join his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on the strength of his 
conviction that "this man will go far." In fact, Lisbon 
politicians no longer laugh when Gomes is mentioned as a 
possible Socialist Party (PS)leader or even presidential 
candidate, Magno comments. The Porto mayor is his own man, he 
continues, quoting him as saying that "I did not leave the 
European Parliament when the Portuguese Government wished to 
push me out, and I do not go where others want to take me." 
According to Magno, Gomes is "calmly" preparing his way south to 
the capital, but remains fully aware that his "vital space" is 
still Porto, at a distance from the seat of government that 
enhances his authority. PS leader Antonio Guterres, who called 
him a "statesman" during the municipal election campaign, had 
nicknamed him "Mr. North" when Gomes helped him wrest the PS 
leadership from former secretary general Jorge Sampaio. In fact, 
despite rumors that Gomes and Guterres will fight for the party 
leadership, nothing points to a duel between the two men, Magno 
asserts, noting that while they may fear each other, their 
relationship also involves sincere mutual appreciation. Gomes' 
real test is still to come, Magno concludes: the sights of a 
winner of a string of regional victories in Porto are now 
naturally set on more important political battles at the end of 
the decade.

LIVES OF MARTIN MAGNER: FAME IN EUROPE, TV PIONEER AND ACTIVE DIRECTOR 




By JANICE ARKATOV 




Martin Magner has lived several lives in his almost 89 years. In his current 
incarnation, the Los Angeles-based director is prepping for the Friday opening 
of "La Ronde" at the Harman Avenue Theatre in Hollywood. From 1939 to 1965, he 
lived in New York, directing television at CBS. Before that, he'd built a 
reputation in Europe as one of the leading directors of modern theater. 


Born in Germany, Magner discovered acting at 18. "I had no idea what a director 
is," he admitted in his gently fractured English. "I thought it is someone who 
makes sure the actors don't bump into each other. As an actor, I played a lot 
of ghosts, did many plays by Strindberg, Dr. Rank in 'A Doll's House,' 
Mephisto. I think I was quite a good devil -- a little devil." 


By 1930, he was working in an increasingly politicized theatrical community. "I 
hate to say leftist because it was just tremendously progressive, very aware -- 
aware of the times, and completely opposed to the Nazi ideology," Magner noted. 
The general director of the theater, who felt especially vulnerable because 
both of his parents were Jewish, feared the repercussions of his work and 
hurriedly left town. 


Officials lost no time filling the post with the half-Jewish Magner. "There 
must be some mistake," he told them. "You can't make me general director; I am 
on both sides Jewish." The visitors produced the 1904 death certificate of his 
father, Maximilian Magner -- a Lutheran. "There was nothing I could say," he 
recalled grimly. "They said, 'You don't know that?' I said, 'Well, my memory is 
sometimes foggy.' " 


Magner held the uneasy position until the night of March 21, 1933, (he 
remembers the exact date of all the important events in his life), when he 
received orders to fire the seven Jewish actors in the company. Without waiting 
for the banks to open in the morning, he packed a suit and a tuxedo, gathered 
his hat, coat and briefcase, and took the night train to Vienna. Three years 
later, Magner sailed to America. 


He holds tight to many cherished memories of his life in Europe. 


Such as the time George Bernard Shaw paid an impromptu visit to a rehearsal of 
Magner's radical production of Shaw's "Too True to Be Good" and declared, 
"Sometimes youth is not wasted on the young" before he strode away. Or the time 
Sigmund Freud (amused by a show Magner was staging, in which a Freud look-alike 
psychiatrist fell asleep over his patient), invited the young director over for 
tea -- and, several meetings later, suggested that Magner become a lay analyst. 


Though he speaks proudly of his accomplishments -- he was presented a special 
award from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle in 1975 -- there is, even in 
the grandest of statements, an endearing absence of hauteur. 


"I have pioneered so much in my life," he said of the early years in TV. " 
'Studio One,' 'Montgomery Presents.' It was a medium that was not yet 
developed. We had to do that. And we could experiment to our heart's content. 
Nobody was looking over our shoulder saying, 'Don't do that' -- because nobody 
knows anything. It was the most exciting direction because it was in your 
hands. In theater, you're backstage biting your nails. But in live television, 
you are in control: You edit while you're on the air." 


Mandatory retirement forced Magner out of CBS in 1965, and he resettled in 
California with his third wife, Marion Palfi, whom he lost to breast cancer in 
1979. "We 


were two bachelors living together," he said of their 27-year marriage. "She 
supported what I did; I supported what she did. She was a remarkable woman, a 
great photographer. Four Guggenheims." He gestures to a volume of 
black-and-white photos, "Invisible in America," Palfi's bold and eloquent 
chronicle of poverty in the South in the 1940s and '50s. 


"When she was marching in Selma with Martin Luther King, she turned to him and 
said, 'Aren't you afraid?' He said, 'Aren't you?' " 


Palfi, a former beauty queen and Ziegfeld star (Magner remembers her face 
adorning public kiosks when he was a young man) effected social change through 
her photos: Robert Kennedy used them in the Justice Department's case against 
the anti-segregationists; they were also instrumental in changing many of the 
country's child labor laws. 


Locally, Palfi taught photography at the Inner City Cultural Center, while 
Magner directed several plays there. "He had an eye for detail," said C. 
Bernard Jackson, ICCC executive director. "Most directors just go for the 
gusto. But I learned from Martin to look for the literary quality, to see 
things beyond their most superficial aspects. Also, at a time when other 
directors weren't utilizing multiracial casts, he did a lot of non-traditional 
casting." 


Coincidentally, "La Ronde," Schnitzler's 19th-Century merry-go-round of love 
and sex, had been one of the plays Magner staged at ICCC; he felt that the time 
was right to visit the work again. "Not that the play is a challenge," he 
admitted. "But it is a charming show, and I like Schnitzler very much. There is 
insight into people of both genders. It's a knowing show, it's smiling -- and, 
I think, it's a very funny play. Risque, yes." (When he originally staged it in 
Europe, "the audience throws stink bombs on stage.") 


After a career steeped in heavy works -- "Genet, Sartre, untold Shaws, Athol 
Fugard at a time when nobody knows of him" -- Magner, whose theater work is 
supported by the local Goethe Institute, is relishing comedy. 


"To me, light things is much more difficult than heavy," the director said. 
"Even back in Germany, when I started, I never liked Teutonic acting. Every 
line was filled with unbelievable importance, as unnatural as you could be. I 
never acted this way. And when I directed, I always said to the actors, 'Why 
don't you talk to each other -- talk and listen.' But in Germany, they like 
major against minor, crashing all the time." 


A former mountain climber ("The desire is not to get to the top -- anybody can 
do that -- but to get higher and higher, into the lighter and lighter air"), 
Magner appears to be a man at peace with his life. "I came in with the century; 
I don't expect to go out with it," he said calmly. 


"I had an operation a year ago, a blood clot next to my brain. Afterward, I 
crawled out of the bed, took one of the walkers and walked till the nurses 
caught me and brought me back. I wanted to live, and I wanted to be well. 


"And I am."

   WASHINGTON


TEXTILE coalitions from the US and Europe yesterday united in Washington to
demand changes in the Uruguay Round negotiating text to force developing
countries to open their textiles and clothing markets to the industrialised
countries.
Mr M L Cates, president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute,
cautioned against a 'rush to a quick and crippling conclusion in the Round',
so as to give the Clinton administration a chance to address issues
neglected in the negotiations.
Mr Cates and Mr Wolfgang Sannwald, president of Comitextil, a coalition of
European producer groups, presented what they called 'a Magna Carta' for the
industry and urged that it be adopted in the Round.
It provides for market openings 'on a reciprocal basis among free market
economy countries'; vigorous measures against piracy of intellectual
property; commitments on labour rights like child labour laws; and
enforcement of environmental standards.

   MONTREAL


MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, continues
its recovery despite weak North American car production caused by the
recession.
For the second quarter to January the group reported net profits of CDollars
10.7m (USDollars 9m) or 26 cents a share, against losses of Dollars 2.3m, or
8 cents a year earlier. Sales were unchanged at Dollars 484m.
First-half profits came to CDollars 36.2m or 84 cents a share, against
CDollars 500,000 or 2 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.1bn, up
12 per cent.
Magna, which also has several plants in Europe, benefited from a shift in
product mix, lower interest rates and lower capital spending. Assuming
conversion of CDollars 200m of convertible debentures, debt-equity ratio is
0.6:1.
The company is resuming common share dividends with a 10 cent cash payment
for the latest quarter. Magna in the latest period achieved a return on
equity of 11 per cent after returning from the brink two years ago.

IT WAS, as Hexham magistrate Mrs Muriel Bowman observed, 'a procedure we
rarely see'.
Normally, at 9.30 am on Thursdays, the magistrates court in the
Northumberland market town hears nothing more momentous than applications
for drinks licences.
However, yesterday's business was special - a last-ditch attempt to throttle
the Maastricht treaty by laying seven charges of treason against the
ministers who signed it: Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and the
former Treasury minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death
penalty under UK law.
The men behind the move, businessman and Conservative political economist Mr
Rodney Atkinson - older brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Freedom
Association chairman Mr Norris McWhirter, earnestly addressed Mrs Bowman.
The massed media - the people of Hexham being conspicuously absent - sat
entranced.
The statutes they handed over were impressive, from the Coronation Oath Act
of 1953 and the 1795 Treason Act to the Magna Carta. Mr Atkinson submitted
that the signing of the Maastricht treaty was contrary to laws and statutes
of the United Kingdom going back over many centuries.
Mrs Bowman played it with a straight bat. She passed it on to the Crown
Prosecution Service.
After the three-minute hearing Mr Atkinson insisted the challenge was
serious. 'My brother is in the business of comedy, I'm afraid on this
occasion I'm in the business of tragedy, a democratic tragedy for the
British people unless this Maastricht treaty is overturned.'
Mr McWhirter threatened a judicial review if the CPS does not act. But did
they really want to see Mr Hurd in the Tower of London? 'The Queen can
always exercise the prerogative of mercy, provided of course by that time
she's not Mrs Elizabeth Windsor, European citizen,' suggested Mr McWhirter.
If their main target was worried, there was no sign of it; he was 300 miles
away at a Downing Street cabinet meeting and was not represented in court.
It was all very civil but then Hexham, chosen for its nearness to Mr
Atkinson's family home and distance from the London political establishment,
has been pretty quiet for the last few centuries since the border wars
between England and Scotland calmed down.
The demonstrators, flanked by banners - 'Hang Hurd High', 'Rodney is Right'
 -were undeterred. Should Mr Hurd hang? 'Yes, absolutely,' said one. 'It's
no more than the government deserves.'

PADRES EXPECTED TO SIGN CARTER TO THREE-YEAR CONTRACT TODAY 




By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




NASHVILLE, Tenn. 




Center fielder Joe Carter will sign a three-year contract today with the 
Padres, sources said, that will finalize the Cleveland Indians' trade with the 
Padres. 


The Padres have agreed to send catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., left fielder Chris 
James and minor league third baseman Carlos Baerga to the Indians for Carter. 


Although Carter and the Padres have yet to finalize terms of the contract, 
which is expected to be in the $3-million-a-year-range, each side agreed to a 
three-year contract that will keep Carter in a Padre uniform through the 1992 
season. 


"He's pretty excited about the trade," said Kansas City Royal second baseman 
Frank White, who visited Tuesday with Carter. "He said the Padres wanted to 
sign him to a four-year deal, but he wanted three years. Really, he's excited 
about everything. 


"The only bad thing about the trade, he said, was where the Padres spend their 
spring training. 


"He hates Yuma." 


Ah, even paradise has its flaws. 


The Padres have a 7 p.m. (PST) deadline today to sign Carter. If they fail, the 
deal would be restructured, or possibly terminated. 


"I can't see that happening, I'm very optimistic we'll get this thing done," 
said Jack McKeon, vice president baseball operations. "There's just a lot of 
details that need to be discussed, and that takes time. If we can get the 
dollar figure and contract provisions taken takes care of, I'm sure we'll get 
it done. 


"Let's just say I'm very confident."

Earlier, Henry I was the first monarch to make it a royal house when in 1121
he married his second wife Adelaide of Louvain in a chapel in the castle.
Their new home was little more than a cold and draughty timbered hall.
Each monarch in turn strengthened and added to the castle. The lower wall of
the dominant Round Tower dates back to Henry II, who reigned from 1154-89.
Two kings were born in the castle: Edward III (1327-77), and the gentle and
pious Henry Vl (1422-61), who founded Eton College. His body lies in the
castle's St George's Chapel.
Henry VIII (1509-47) made additions to St George's Chapel and his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), built a gallery which is now part of the
Royal Library.
Work on the inside of the castle was carried out by Sir Christopher Wren on
the command on Charles II (1660-85), although he was not often resident
there.
George III - 'Farmer George', who was king for 60 years from 1760 - loved
the whole of the Thames valley, and since then Windsor's popularity has
never wavered. Queen Victoria (1837-1901) loved the castle more and more as
she grew older.
The state apartments are open to the public when the Queen is not in
residence and visitors can view a collection of paintings by Holbein,
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Canaletto, as well as important
collections of furniture, porcelain and tapestries. Also on display are
drawings by old masters, including Leonardo da Vinci.

    Ramos Approves `Actualization' of AFTA Measures 
    Ramos Approves `Actualization' of AFTA Measures

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos has approved the adoption 
of new measures to speed up the actualization of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area or AFTA following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General 
Agreement on Tariff and Trade or GATT. With the signing of the 
Uruguay Round final act this month, the ASEAN-member countries 
want to ensure that preferential treatment under the AFTA is not 
diminished. The ASEAN groups the Philippines, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam. 
  President Ramos approved three basic approaches as proposed 
by the Philippine Council for ASEAN Cooperation's Technical 
Board. These are: 
  -- Broadening the coverage of the Common Effective 
Preferential Tariff or CEPT by including products selected from 
the temporary exclusion list; 
  -- Broadening the same inclusion list by including 
unprocessed agricultural products from the permanent exclusion 
list; and, 
  -- Improving the existing AFTA CEPT inclusion list. 
  Under the first approach, some 52 items were first delisted 
from temporary exclusion list. These items are those classified 
as natural processed and those under Memorandum Order No. 95 
implementing the Magna Carta for Small Farmers and the 
government rationalization program. 
  A line-by-line evaluation of the remaining 662 items in the 
temporary exclusion list will be done to determine which should 
be included in the AFTA CEPT scheme based on a set of criteria. 
  Under the second approach, some unprocessed agricultural 
products will be lifted from the permanent exclusion list to 
conform with increasing criteria adopted by other member 
countries. 
  The third approach includes measures shortening from 15 
years 
to 10 years the period for bringing the tariff levels of 1,086 
[word indistinct] to 5 percent or less, as well as deepening the 
tariff cuts.

GIANTS SIGN CARTER FOR ONE YEAR 




From Associated Press 




SAN FRANCISCO 




The San Francisco Giants have signed free-agent veteran catcher Gary Carter to 
a one-year contract, the club announced today. 


Carter, 35, is an 11-time All-Star selection and a career .265 hitter with 304 
home runs during 15 Major League seasons, but he suffered through a poor season 
last year. 


Carter hit just .183 with two home runs and 15 RBIs while playing in a 
career-low 50 games for the New York Mets in 1989. He was out much of the 
season with an injured right knee. 


Contract terms were not released by the Giants. Last year, Carter's contract 
with the Mets was valued at $2.16 million. 


"Gary Carter is a great asset for our ballclub," said Al Rosen, president and 
general manager of the National League champions. "We think he can still 
produce both offensively and defensively. He's a proven leader both on the 
field and in the clubhouse. 


"Gaining Gary gives us another proven veteran at the catching position, which 
is something a number of clubs would like to have," he said. 


After playing for the Mets and Montreal Expos, Carter returns to California, 
where he attended high school. He's a 1972 graduate of Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton. 


"I'm excited to be a Giant," said Carter from his home in Palm Beach Gardens, 
Fla. "Since Al Rosen and (Manager) Roger Craig came to San Francisco, no team 
has been more committed to success. I've gotten used to being in a winning 
atmosphere the last several years, and I'm sure that will continue this year. 
We have an outstanding lineup, and I'm looking forward to making whatever 
contribution I can." 


Carter, who ranks fifth on the all-time Major League list of games caught with 
1,823, was a member of the 1986 Mets team that won the World Series.
