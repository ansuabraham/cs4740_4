<HEAD>Lacroix Still Signs Clothes with Fun, Fantasy and Luxury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix, maintaining his reputation as a
young creator, brought out a collection of fun, fantasy, lace and
furs on the first day of haute couture showings for next winter.
   As Paris sweltered under a rare heatwave, top couturiers on
Sunday unveiled their luxurious, befurred and feathered models for
cooler weather.
   Lacroix's pouf skirt finally ran out of steam. But he's kept a
taste for beautiful, opulent fabrics and top-heavy outfits full of
quirky, funny ideas.
   He's a man who takes chances with these expensive fabrics and he
usually wins, though not always. The applause after the show was
tepid.
   Bernard Arnault, head of the Agache financial consortium backing
Lacroix, waffled when asked if the eccentric, creative designer is
still a hot money-maker. ``His clothes are beautiful. That's all
that counts,'' he said.
   Lacroix's clothes with the draped fichu shoulder, the big hoods
or head scarves and collars over tiny skirts are great on the
runway, but perhaps not at every party, no matter how splashy.
   He used a lot of browns, dolling up pinstriped jackets with
draped satin fronts and sable cuffs, sometimes teamed with a
mole-colored velvet skirt. Mixing up textures with abandon, he put
a tiny lame ``damasked'' bolero over a trapeze minidress in shades
of mustard and burgundy, with a quilted velvet panel on the skirt.
   Some of the luxury fantasy was hilarious, till one tried to tote
up the cost of the enormous sable parka topping chocolate shorts
with braided silk cornrows flipping over them like a reggae singer
gone wild _ a mini-fantasy well over $30,000.
   Lacroix's violet jersey dress was a soothing contrast to all the
show-off fabrics. His little shortie flared coats in faille and
satin were wearable. There were wonderful moments like the long,
slinky carmine velvet coat with huge sparkling buttons worn over
slimming pants embroidered with stars.
   The brown and khaki silks were always topped up with lively
shades of coral, saffron, turquoise or gold.
   For evening, Lacroix's hand-painted pink and green tulle
ballerina fantasies and jeweled tunics looked like a Midsummer
Night's Dream of luxury. Other ballerina numbers were in rich red
velvet and black, always sparkling with touches of gold.
   The dazzling jeweled boleros and jackets looked like a treasure
trove of Ali Baba's Cave.
   And after Christian discovered his mom's lace-edged satin
slip-dress, his versions of lace for the runway simply took off in
a froth of glory.
   The heavy guipure effects, the lame-embroidered dresses in
khaki, cream and gold, the damasked and brocade dresses with
pheasant or ostrich-feather trim harked back to the best of the
negligee looks in the Twenties and Thirties. But things were always
a bit on the wild side _ a la Christian Lacroix.
   Japanese couturiere Hanae Mori, celebrating 35 years in the
fashion business and a new shop in Paris, showed beautifully
crafted clothes with more workmanship than fantasy.
   Her fit and cut are always impeccable, and the swirling
red-black-green harlequin coat over a pine green short sheath is
anything but stodgy. Her full-skirted grey flannel suits with black
velvet decor and the Mori trademark butterfly pins should please
her faithful regulars.
   Her true couture details _ like satin basketweaving basque
waists in suits _ testified to her craftsmanship. She was lavish
with fancy fabrics, but her lame-flecked or sequin-embroidered lace
numbers were demure rather than daring.
   The dresses that made one want to weep with joy were the chiffon
prints in Mori's ``old'' style _ the feather-light chiffon print
landscapes with the most delicate Japanese prints of flowers, trees
and birds.
   Torrente's forte is showbiz, and she wisely showed plenty of
spangled numbers to look great onstage or at a gala dinner.
   Her three full, long cashmere wraparound coats in emerald,
cardinal and rust looked light, easy and warm. Her saffron fitted
spencer jacket over an aubergine long, slinky skirt is a good way
of easing into evening.
   And she went all out for late-day glitz: a few jet embroidered
dresses had discreet trains. Colorful patchwork jackets had fur or
ostrich-feather cuffs. The all-sequined slink would be fine for
midnight at Las Vegas. Easier to wear would be the tuxedos with big
pearl pink satin lapels.

<HEAD>Hot and Sweet Clothes from Lacroix, Versace for Summer Couture</HEAD>

   Runways sizzled and burst into bloom at summer
couture shows that opened over the weekend.
   The extravagant dream clothes by Gianni Versace, Christian
Lacroix, Hanae Mori and Torrente showed that flowers and feathers
will be hot this summer.
   Italian Gianni Versace got a jump on the French fashion houses
by showing his feathery decollete styles Saturday night at the Ritz
Hotel.
   ``Paris is mine'' crowed the 43-year-old designer, who is not an
official member of the French designers association and was staging
his first show of atelier clothes in the City of Lights.
   Versace turned out witty, minx-like and colorful styles with
enough elaborate beading to create a couture effect.
   ``Great for wives of the mafia,'' groused one resentful French
fashion commentator.
   But Julie Andrews loved them. ``Especially the little sheaths
with boa effects and jeweled necklines,'' said the star.
   Versace is designing the costumes for ``Ch'in Ch'in,'' a new
film starring Miss Andrews and Marcello Mastrioanni and directed by
Gene Saks.
   Versace won hearts with his sexy cuts that were too playful to
be vulgar. His use of elaborate beading, ostrich feathers and
rhinestones on asymmetrically draped long skirts and short skirts
were typical of the inventive Italian.
   His swirled breastplate effects on bustiers vied with
embroidered commedia dell'arte harlequin and abstract effects in
hot colors on lean pants or skirts. Also featured were
ostrich-feather tutu styles and a rhinestone-edged, flame-red
sheath split to the hip.
   Christian Lacroix's show Sunday night at the Intercontinental
Hotel ballroom was no less stunning and began with some wonderful
dressy silk and crepe suits with fitted asymmetrical jackets and
huge rhinestone buttons.
   Lacroix used opulent fabrics, often bringing out his signature
touches like trapeze-shaped coats, enormous puffy sleeves, draped
fichu or shawl effects and the occasional big organza bow-train
down the back. He also brought out some luscious organzas edged in
appliqued flowers.
   Lacroix used clouds of ostrich feathers to give a light touch to
some beautifully cut chiffons and georgette silks in delectable
colors like butter, peach and tea-rose pink.
   And looking at the bias cuts leaves no doubt: Lacroix may be an
artist above all, but he's definitely become a couturier.
   Japanese couturier Hanae Mori _ considered a Paris designer for
more than 15 years now _ showed the sexiest, youngest fashions
she's ever designed.
   Her skirts were often draped, clinging with hemlines way above
the knee, and jackets were fitted and sometimes featured plunging
necklines over sweetheart strapless dresses.
   Brown was a favorite color with Mrs. Mori, and she dolled it up
beautifully in white-striped fitted silk grosgrain suits, draped it
and paired it with lace in slinky evening gowns.
   She also went in for some siren-like vermilion draped silks, and
striking shades like cyclamen purple paired with gold lame.
   Besides her enchanting trademark sequined Japanese landscape and
wave-patterned embroidered dresses, Mrs. Mori also used some of her
favorite motifs _ butterflies and flowers.
   Torrente, whose real name is Rose Mett, also laid on a
lighthearted show that included pique suits with swooped hems on
the fitted jackets for day wear. She dressed up navy crepe suits to
advantage with gold lame rick-rack piping, and some of her great
flower-girl looks centered on enormous anemone print chemise
dresses that looked very easy to wear.
   Among her charming girlish looks were short lace ballerina
dresses and slinky strapless gowns with touches of raffia.

<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40,000 models of a classic American
toy have been recalled because paint used on them may contain too
much lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The agency also says hundreds of thousands of clown dolls are
being recalled because they pose a choking hazard.
   The makers of ``Slinky'' animal pull toys, a variation on the
standard accordion-like wired toy, are voluntarily recalling them
because the red paint used on the eyes, tongue and cheeks may
contain a higher percentage of lead paint than the agency allows.
   CPSC standards limit to .06 percent the lead content of paint
used on children's items.
   The 43,000 Slinky toys sold since 1986, have red and white pull
cords and come in the form of a train, worm, seal, frog,
caterpillar, dalmation and kitten. They are made by James
Industries Inc. of Hollidaysburg, Pa.
   The CPSC also said 234,000 dolls manufactured by the Omaha-based
Oriental Trading Co. and sold through mail order catalogues as the
``Dress Up Clown'' or ``Funny Clown'' were recalled because they
have small parts that present a choking risk to young children.
   The agency said the 13-inch dolls, used to teach children to
dress themselves, have zipper clasps, buttons and buckles that came
off during standard tests.
   ``These small parts make the dolls banned hazardous substances
because they present a choking, ingestion and aspiration hazard to
children,'' the agency said in a written statement.
   There have been no reported injuries associated with either toy.
   Consumers may return the toys to the place of purchase for a
full refund.

   Children around the world have played
with springy Slinkies for 43 years, but the 70-year-old woman who
helped invent the wire toy says it hasn't been all fun and games.
   Betty James, president of James Industries Inc., says her late
husband, Richard James, a mechanical engineer and naval architect,
came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship. He
saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce.
   Mrs. James took control of the business in 1960, when her
husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a
religious cult in Bolivia. He died there in 1974.
   ``To this day,'' she said, ``I don't know what a torsion spring
is.''
   James Industries is a spartan, no-nonsense firm that turns out
Slinkies by the millions in this small central Pennsylvania town.
It employs 120 people who manufacture, package, sell and ship
Slinkies from a single building.
   A grandmother of 10, Mrs. James says she's basically a doting
mother devoted to her six adult children and their families.
According to her oldest son, she's also a demanding and assertive
boss.
   ``She expects a lot out of you. She expects you to produce. And,
so you do produce,'' said Richard James II, 46. He is Slinky sales
manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join
the family business.
   Mrs. James, who is known as ``Big Betty,'' is not too big to
take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks.
``When we first moved into this building, I used to clean the
toilets, too,'' she said.
   She's been involved in every aspect of production and promotion.
   Slinky was put on the market in 1945, after the Jameses spent
two years experimenting with various types of steel.
   After receiving a patent, they demonstrated the toys at a
Gimbel's department store in Philadelphia. ``They gave us the end
of a counter so we could show how it walked,'' Mrs. James recalled.
   ``I was so scared that no one would buy them, I called a friend
and asked her to come along. I thought we would each buy one if
nobody else did,'' she said.
   She needn't have worried. After a quick demonstration, the first
400 Slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each.
   ``I was so taken aback when I saw this crowd of people _ and
everyone was waving dollar bills.''
   Each night, Mrs. James took the day's production home from the
manufacturer and wrapped the Slinkies by hand with yellow paper.
   Richard James, meanwhile, came up with other inventions, but
none were successful.
   ``He was a dreamer,'' she said. ``He developed a refrigerator
that would dispense soft drinks, but we took it out because we were
drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat. He also wanted to
work on an amphibious car.''
   When her husband left, Mrs. James struggled to keep the business
alive to feed herself and her children.
   ``To me, my family is the most precious thing in life. ... I
always wanted a family because I was an only child,'' she said.
``You do what you have to do for them. I did what I had to do.''
   The first Slinky plant was in Philadelphia's Germantown section.
Mrs. James moved to Hollidaysburg, 180 miles away, 23 years ago
because she had family and friends in the area who could help care
for her children.
   The family moved a year and a half before the company's move was
complete, and Mrs. James commuted to Philadelphia each week. She
drove to Philadelphia on Sunday evenings, returning home on
Thursdays.
   ``It was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six
of us,'' her son Richard said.
   Today, James Industries sells millions of Slinkies around the
world. Mrs. James, who with her children owns all company stock,
declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual
sales figures. Slinkies usually retail for less than $2.
   The company produces other toys, including building blocks,
plastic rings, games and pin wheels. ``But Slinky outsells them
all,'' Mrs. James said.
   ``It's simple. It's a universal toy. It's a toy that doesn't
need any explanation. It has intrinsic play value,'' her son said.
``There are very few other toys like that.''
   James Industries began producing brightly colored plastic
Slinkies in 1979, to appeal to younger children, especially infants.
   Mrs. James and her son gasp at the thought of updating the
television commercial jingle that declares ``Slinky, Slinky ...
Everyone loves a Slinky.'' The song was written in 1963.
   ``We'll just stick to something that's good,'' she said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fall fashion message from London is short,
sporty by day and slinky by night, with flashes of British wit and
individuality.
   The mood among designers, however, is uncertain.
   Top designers Katherine Hamnett and John Galliano skipped London
to show in Paris. Two other big names, Rifat Ozbek and Jaspar
Conran, opted for videos instead of catwalk shows, and fewer buyers
stopped off in London en route from Milan to Paris.
   Nonetheless, there was still some of that old wacky madness that
put London on the fashion map.
   Vivienne Westwood, the mother of punk garb, captivated the
audience with a collection ranging from classic tailored tartan
suits to fake fur-trimmed bloomers worn with Old Master-print
corsets.
   A Lycra-clad dancing troupe dressed as haute couture pigs opened
the show based on barnyard characters of country life. Bodymap did
a vision of drag-queen club life in their sexy sportswear
collection.
   Britain's designers of the year, Workers For Freedom duo Richard
Nott and Graham Fraser, showed a collection Nott described as
``spare feminity,'' which featured bikinis over striped body suits,
one of the key fall looks from London.
   London Fashion Week, which ends Tuesday, has spread out even
further with designers showing all over town and the trade show
featuring about 250 exhibitors at the Olympia 2 exhibition hall.
   At Olympia, accessories from hats to bracelets seemed hotter
than clothes.
   ``I think largely because of high interest rates and the high
cost of living, women can't afford to buy another outfit, so
they're buying accessories,'' said Beverley Mann, 28, one of the
design duo of the costume jewelry firm Flash Harry.
   Melanie Lazlo of Obsession, another costume jewelry firm, said:
``London is kind of a melting pot for a wide range of accessories
ranging from the weird and wonderful to the Channel-type classic.''
   Many fashion designers said the number of buyers was down.
   ``It's much quieter than it was last year,'' said David Sassoon
of Belville Sassoon-Lorcan Mullany, one of London's top eveningwear
designers.
   ``I think stores everywhere are having a hard time,'' he said.
``Where money's tight, they want selling clothes. They don't want
jokes. ... They don't want over the top things they might have
indulged in previously.''
   Benny Ong, another leading designer whose soft, sensual clothes
sell internationally, agreed that the economic situation was
keeping buyers away from London.
   ``That's why it's important at those times when the economic
situation is not so hot to go for color _ to pick yourself up,'' he
said. ``Power-dressing has also changed to something more feminine
and confident.''
   Edina Ronay, bucking the trend with her first catwalk show, said
her business was up and insisted London was ``not going to fall
flat on its face because two people show in Paris,''
   Her collection of suits and parkas in orange, ochre and olive,
fur-trimmed and brocade hooded jackets and skin-tight gold lame and
black tops and body suits won high marks for wearability.
   There were plenty other wearable clothes as well.
   Bruce Oldfield, who designs many of Princess Diana's dresses,
incorporated the sporty spirit in his hooded, printed parkas,
luxurious velvet bodysuits, sequined sweatshirts and a
gold-sequined bomber jacket with pants.
   Caroline Charles did a ``Eurochic'' collection featuring
Romanian peasant embroideries and folksy tapestry and fringing
alongside her snappy city suits and slinky evening dresses.
   Ozbek abandoned his summer white for dazzling colors _ another
fall theme _ in hooded tops, tunics, cropped bomber jackets and
leggings and body suits in dazzling sequins, stretch velvet and
gold lame.
   Conran found his inspiration in ``the off-duty ballerina,'' with
body-hugging catsuits topped by cropped leather jackets and quilted
bronze bomber jackets.
   Helen Story, one of the up-and-coming young designers, had fun
with a soccer-for-women look, again featuring hooded bomber jackets
and soccer shorts with her signature fringing.

   Lots of youthful, feminine clothes were shown in
early openings Wednesday as ready-to-wear shows for summer 1990 got
underway.
   Great fabrics, curvy silhouettes and soft color palettes were
about the only things designers had in common as everybody did his
or her own thing.
   Also on the opening day, Lanvin announced at a press conference
that Claude Montana _ known as one of the most creative
ready-to-wear talents in Paris _ would be the new creator of
Lanvin's couture. Montana is a maverick, whose strong fashions and
silhouettes have often rocked the fashion world.
   Montana's first couture collection will be shown in January, for
next summer.
   In her tent show in a courtyard of the Louvre, Lolita Lempicka
showed clothes with just enough chic to keep the sweet fashions
from cloying. Her bicolored fitted linen suits, either short to the
knee or maxi-length, often had fitted jackets with scalloped
necklines.
   One of her main silhouettes was formed by gold-buttoned long
redingotes giving a funnel shape to the linens or textured
``beehive'' ivory silks.
   Other flowingly feminine shapes came out under billowy-topped
dusters with long wrapped skirts.
   Lempicka's garden-party clothes had fresh allure with appliqued
daisies or fitted jackets in daisy prints. Dressy looks for wedding
parties are Lempicka's forte, but she also brought out some fun
fringed, clinging outfits in raffia _ a big new ``fabric'' for next
summer.
   Doby Broda's idea of the 1990s harks to the 1930s, with lots of
flowing pyjamas and long skirts. Some in the audience liked her
flower-sprigged ``farmer's daughter'' dresses in soft or murky
colors.
   More fun were her easy pants or skirts outfits based on
``dishcloth'' linens _ the little loose dishcloth-plaid boleros
paired with solid blue full pants, skirts or occasionally shorts.
   For evening, her gold lame bias-cut dresses and flared pants
looked slinky enough to steal applause at parties, though perhaps
not quite luxurious enough for Marlene Dietrich.
   Emmanuelle Khanh brought out a lot of long and slinky suits for
cruise wear, as well as some modest one-piece maillot bathing suits
with little flounces at the hip.
   Her sailor looks ranged from pants to shorts to skirts _ in
crisp navy and white or more original rusty brown cottons and
linens. For late-day, her best lines were easily fitted outfits
with strong black and white arabesque embroideries around collars
and shoulders.
   The Japanese are out in force as usual. Hanae Mori will show
later in the week, but Tuesday night was awarded the Legion of
Honor for her contribution to Paris fashion in the couture and
ready-to-wear shows she has shown and sold here for over 20 years.
   Junko Shimada's bouncy young styles were always figure-hugging,
featuring bright turquoise beach mini-dresses with pointed hems,
printed in seashell patterns, topped with fishnet stoles.
   There was lots of creativity here _ from scalloped pique fitted
suits with very short skirts to a whole range of clinging broadly
striped sailor suits teaming pullovers with bell-bottomed jerseys
or tight bermudas like turn-of-the-century bathing costumes.
   The neat linen suits with decollete, small-waisted jackets in
shades of sand, turquoise, pale pink and chocolate had details like
big bucket pockets, tab pockets or perky pointed peplums.
   And Shimada's combinations of dark plaids and insets, sleeves
and double collars or tobacco-brown organza looked original, if not
for everyone.
   Party girls with good figures will probably love the khaki green
clinging jersey and gold lame outfits with their gold lattice-work
hemlines and mousseline stoles.
   Hiroko Koshino's collection was based on a cruise down the Nile,
from safari suits to outfits with asymmetrical details, folding and
pleating that could have come right from an Egyptian fresco or the
wardrobe of Cleopatra herself.
   In patterned silks and textured linens, the inspiration may have
been ancient, but the lines were modern _ with lots of high-waisted
pants, some bare midriffs, original jackets with one side covered
in a pleated scarf effect over wraparound skirts.
   There were lots of long jackets over pleated skirts or vests
sewn onto the skirt in a dress. And whether worn with shorts,
pleated or draped long skirts, the effect of these combinations was
never heavy.
   The colors _ sandy beige or grey, Nile green, deep fresco blue,
terra-cotta and mustard or gold _ gave the silk and linen outfits
an original cachet for next summer.
   Transparency was rife in the shows, but nowhere was it more
obvious than at Kimijima. He concentrated on mousselines and
fishnets topped with enough sparkly sequins to cause a few
shipwrecks with sailors spotting his revealing mermaid minis.

<TEXT>
   From classic elegance at Givenchy to skin-tight and
slinky jerseys at Tarlazzi, styles in Friday's fashion shows for
next summer ran the gamut.
   Tailored, ruffled, draped, and bare-midriff looks took over the
runways as the fashion picture was unfocused.
   Givenchy had his act together, a sophisticated range of clothes
that looked worthy of the elder statesman of couture.
   But the clothes were far from elderly. Givenchy simply took some
of his favorite themes and brought them out in luxurious fabrics.
He firmly padded shoulders for shape, ignoring the softer shoulders
elsewhere. There were lots of short skirts and easy long pants, in
plaid or solid suits with fitted or bolero tops. The suits were
handsome in windowpane plaids, stripes or glen plaids in silks,
linens and cottons.
   Simple sheaths with big padded cap sleeves or off-the-shoulder
banded tops with huge puffy sleeves over narrow short skirts added
to the range of feminine silhouettes for summer.
   There were navy, gray and neutrals for daytime, with sizzling
colors for later on. They came out in gazar or organza outfits with
big flounces, flowered prints, shades of orange, pink, wisteria and
turquoise, sometimes decorated with lily-of-the valley appliques or
sparkly fish just for fun.
   Karl Lagerfeld's ideas oozed with originality, all the clothes
cut for action from striped knit pullovers, long pants and shorts
to the fluid, full-skirted minis.
   Borrowing some of his own ideas from Chanel, where he's also
head designer, Lagerfeld sometimes paired big tweed checked blazers
with dark chiffon culottes and long skirts.
   Jackets were the forte, and whether short or long, they were
always fitted to the waist, and often had deeply cut lapels,
hugging the hips over contrasting short and lean skirts with
matching tights or the new, full minis. The best jacket had
crescent-shaped lapels _ one large, one small _ and for evening it
came out with pearled embroidery.
   Lagerfeld's prettiest cocktail clothes paired up black and white
short looks in bustier outfits with revealing black lace loose
jackets.
   Folklore and graphic prints with sequins and big polka-dotted
satins and cottons looked great too. Lagerfeld mixed them up in
tiny minis with fitted jackets, or in long, high-waisted pyjamas
and short or cutaway jackets.
   ``Come play with me,'' declared Angelo Tarlazzi in his program.
The Italian designer, who now also plies his trade for Guy Laroche
couture, went all out for hot-colored and clingy knits, leaving
little to the imagination. With elastic shoulder wraps, many bare
midriffs, pleated ruffles at the bust or hem, some of the viscose
knits were convertible _ and could be pulled out from mini length
to make a long dress.
   The most amusing evening dresses were called ``totems,'' and
combined bubbles of African-inspired prints in hot colors and black
with raffia fringes and fishnet hems.
   To emphasize the waist, he gave a girdle effect in lame
waist-cinchers to many outfits, with fullness in blouses above and
long pants or shorts below.
   Tarlazzi raided the linen closet for his ideas in summer white:
hem-stitched jackets and flounced skirts with boleros were a great
exercise in what you can do with sheets, napkins and tablecloths.
   Anne-Marie Beretta's daytime suits with mother of pearl buttons
or snaps on long jackets worn with pedal pushes or pleated skirts
looked a bit too strict for the pampered set that frequents the
Automobile Club, where the show was held.
   The outfits were better in light pastel linens, forest green and
petrol blue than in the rather sad shades of khaki, putty and muddy
brown that predominated.
   She draped lots of clothes rather awkwardly for daytime, giving
them a heavy look in front. But some of the taffeta and lace
evening drapes and big ruffles were opulent if not especially
feminine.
   Woodstock was reborn for Bernard Perris, who went back to the
1960s and '70s for his inspiration. His girls trotted out in
flared, funnel-shaped trousers, lots of embroidered and jeweled
hipster pants and skirts, and fringes all over the place.
   He also harked back to the age of Aquarius in his mixed Indian
cotton and silk prints in wrapped and draped skirts and
cummerbunds. And his idea of the tuxedo got all dressed up with
acres of long tassels.
   Bellbottomed pants, jumpsuits and shorts came out at Chloe, the
collection designed by Martine Sitbon. Her black pants suits or
short skirts with cutaway jackets were stitched with white, giving
nice vertical lines all over.
   The many cut-outs, bareback and bare-midriff outfits gave
another nod to the 1960s in this group of shows that seems to be
floundering as designers search for details and silhouettes for the
1990s.

   The Wildlife Ministry has fired 10 game
wardens and rangers and suspended 33 others in a campaign to stop
elephant poaching, newspapers reported Friday.
   Wild game hunting is banned in Kenya, but poachers kill
elephants for their valuable ivory tusks and are decimating Kenya's
elephant herds.
   Ivory tusks sell for $82 a pound. Much of the ivory smuggled
from Kenya ends up in the Far East, where it is carved into jewelry
and figurines.
   ``If they have broken the law, they will be prosecLeakey, assistant
minister for tourism and wildlife, told
Parliament on Thursday. Leakey's comments were reportuted,'' Philip
ed by Kenya's
three English-language newspapers, The Standard, the Daily Nation
and the Kenya Times.
   He said the 10 rangers and game wardens dismissed had been
working in Tsavo, Masai Mara and Amboseli national parks.
Twenty-nine game wardens and four rangers also have been
interdicted pending further investigations, said Leakey.
   ``We have sacked them and investigations are ongoing,'' he said.
``Every effort will be made to bring these people to justice.''
   It was unclear whether the 43 rangers and game wardens affected
by the move included the 33 officers of different ranks the
ministry suspended in September.
   Leakey said the ministry planned to intensify training programs
for wildlife officers in K come home, to bring his wife and two children
back to their own country, but his professional achievements and
aspirations had reached too high. So he set out to fulfill a new
dream: a world-class heart hospital in India. Now it has become a
reality. ``It's a passion for me to come back and train others,''
he says.

fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken feed'' or

<HEAD>Winter Haute Couture is Short, Scintillating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This winter's tale of haute couture as seen last
week was a fabulous fantasy, with designers spinning out their
dreams in rich confections for the elite, or just for show.
   Short to shorter is the norm in daytime lengths, though houses
like Saint Laurent and Givenchy generally kept skirts wearably just
above the knee.
   And was enough gold and jeweled embroidery around to boost many
prices into the stratosphere.
   But dream on ... and take note of silhouettes, fabrics and
color, often more modestly available in ready-to-wear. There is a
rainbow of possibilities, with each designer pushing his own
outlines and themes.
   The fashion world was pleased to see Claude Montana win the
coveted Golden Thimble award for his Lanvin collection, following
his disappointing debut there last January.
   His pyramid shortie coats and babydoll jackets, his lean pants
or skirt suits, his great use of luxury fabrics from cashmere to
faille taffeta showed Montana's mastery of his art, so often
praised before in his own luxury ready-to-wear line.
   The pyramid shape or other shortie-coat looks cropped up all
over the place. Saint Laurent's more sober versions have deep, full
dolmen sleeves.
   Shoulders are mainly rounded, even sloped. The only hold-outs
for important padding are Saint Laurent and Givenchy.
   Suits are body-skimming but not so tight as a few seasons ago,
with great long jackets and some nice flyaway boleros.
   Generally the daytime fabrics were smooth, light and soft in
cashmeres or broadcloth or tweedy, with flecked or herringbones,
some bold black and red plaids _ great at Valentino, for example.
Python is a new favorite for trim at Givenchy, for a whole jacket
or more at Saint Laurent.
   Daytime colors included fall stand-bys _ siena, gray, burnt
orange, ochre, pine and brick, plus some white and all the browns
from caramel to chocolate. Dior's Gianfranco Ferre did
extraordinary things with mixes of blue shades from plum to
ultramarine or indigo.
   In both daytime and late-day wear, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
pleased those who would like to look young and kittenish with minis
over fancy thigh boots _ from hot satin to jeweled or embroidered
suede.
   Lagerfeld's boots were among the most flamboyant in a
newly-revived trend for long, lean and high or flat-heeled boots.
   He seems torn between the 1960s ingenue look and the l8th
century of Marie-Antoinette, topping dressy, skimpy minis with big
satin and taffeta embroidered pannier skirts.
   Exotic lands and themes inspired many designers. Jean-Louis
Scherrer was praised for a collection based on the splendors of
North Africa and the Near East in Persian-rug weaves for his suits
and colorful hooded burnoose-style coats.
   Except for a wild jeweled bathing suit with tights, Christian
Lacroix kept his exuberance in check, though there was plenty of
glamor in evening dresses inspired by Goya, or contemporary gold
lame suits topped with enormous velvet artists' berets, as well as
some extravagant Moorish-style embroidery.
   Everything came up roses at Ungaro, who used magnificent flower
prints from dawn to dark. His bright piped tweed daytime suits in
grey, red or royal blue with their checked stoles were stunning too.
   It was in evening wear, however, that Ungaro and other
couturiers turned into real showmen. His extravagant, rosy silk
panniered dresses might not be to everybody's taste. But he offered
an alternative: glamorous black slinky crepe or chiffon gowns with
halter necklines, camisole or scooped-out tops draped in
rhinestones or pearls.
   For evening, anything goes as long as it looks rich. And
decolletes are more daring than ever, with bosoms pushed up under
empire curved bodices, visible in sparkly net or chiffon
see-throughs, or suggestive with necklines slashed to the waist.
   Feathers came out often _ ostriches, pheasant, cock and other
types were used. Scherrer's spicy asymmetrical draped and feathered
minis were especially titillating.

<TEXT>
   Feathery-light fabrics and skin-baring styles
pepped up the runways Tuesday as designers revealed their happy
holiday haute couture clothes for summer.
   The day was a triumph for Emanuel Ungaro, who has been totally
seduced by a light new look. He's simplified his feminine styles to
essentials, using gossamer fabrics and stunning colors to display
his talents.
   This is great news for his fans who found some of his recent
shows overloaded with show-off trimmings and superfluous details.
   ``C'est la vie,'' Ungaro smiled after the show when asked if his
recent marriage had been an influence on his fashion. The
Italian-born couturier, long a Paris fixture, married Laura Fanfani
in November. They are expecting a baby.
   Ungaro's new looks started off with neatly fitted raw silk suits
in shades of bordeaux and chrome yellow followed by bi- and
tricolored light gabardine suits with swirling details in shades
from violet, pink and orange to khaki and some peacock blues.
   ``I was aiming for the elegance of my old master, Balenciaga,''
said Ungaro.
   His remarkable daytime looks included satin-lined short cashmere
coats in sizzling colors topping some beautifully cut and draped
short crepe dresses.
   When it came to dressier clothes, Ungaro followed through
beautifully. His slinky short silk shifts in all colors topped by
floaty mousseline squares were perfect in their understatement.
   Of course, Ungaro had to have some fun with rich fabrics. He
used plenty of heavy guipure lace, draped lame floral fabrics, and
sequined, brocaded jackets or blouses to haute couture advantage.
   Karl Lagerfeld also had a light touch in his show for Chanel,
which won warm praise from the fashion crowd.
   The abbreviated styles were resolutely younger than ever. They
were so short and sweet they looked apt for the junior miss set.
   Lagerfeld continued some of his past Chanel ideas. For instance
the shortie jacket over legs alone became a sort of pretty
coat-dress this time and in fact was cut sexily like a tulip. It
could be worn with a half-skirt or a puff of chiffon.
   These Lolitas often paraded down the runway in long ``Amazon''
or fitted riding jackets with deep decolletes. There were all kinds
of couture details: black velvet cuffs and lapels on the softest of
pinks, black and white raffia piping on many jackets and skirts,
graphic geometric patterns embroidered on a white mini-coat.
   To end it all in grand style, Lagerfeld brought out an array of
short-long evening gowns bathed in clouds of chiffon, sometimes
combined with elaborate guipure lace.
   Louis Feraud turned out a smashing collection of bright,
beautiful clothes showing the creator from the south of France in
top form. He led off with a garden party of emerald and violet
leaf-embroidered short suits with scoop necks, setting a sunny tone.
   Everything was bright and wearable, even the full, iridescent
taffeta garden-party gowns in shades of gold-red with tucks at
bustier and hemline.
   Feraud had lots to put anybody in a good mood. Sportive women
might like the emerald and black gros-grain blazer over a pleated
light satin emerald short skirt.
   A woman dressing for Paris would like the ivory white suits with
a black sunray yoke effect at the neck of a boxy jacket. The
broad-striped pastel linens would be winners for all kinds of
summer moments.
   An ebullient Feraud turned out a rainbow of pastels in crepe
dresses cut in arabesques or swirls topped by huge chiffon shawls.
   It was down to the sea for the end of the show with a gorgeous
line of sequined mermaid flapper dresses and prints in funny fish
motifs.
   All was light and lovely at Philippe Venet, who turned out his
usual superb couture looks _ this time sexier and more colorful
than ever.
   Not known to the masses, Venet is one of the rare couturiers who
owns his own business and makes a living by serving up custom-made
couture to a faithful clientele.
   He led off with lean raw silk outfits piped in satin, perhaps a
strapless dress and fitted jacket in bordeaux and coral setting the
tone for the clothes that followed. He featured some particularly
marvelous suits, scooping out many necklines to daring decolletes.
   The palette was lovely, and full of warm tones like tangerine,
peach, almond green, lilac and tender pink. But one shouldn't
forget the incomparably lovely iridescent satin and taffeta short
evening dresses with their huge bows and jeweled touches.
   Angelo Tarlazzi, the Italian-born couturier at Guy Laroche since
the designer died last year, went south of the border for his
inspiration. Some suggest he should have stayed there, since the
blouson toppers over narrow minis or ample peasant dresses with
stitched details looked more like ready-to-wear than couture.
   Not even the transparent chiffon-topped evening wear had enough
distinction to give the show cachet.

   Suits are back in force for spring _ especially as
haute couture sees the picture. They look everything from wildly
extroverted to wearable for business and travel.
   And the crowning glory of all the couture pizazz is _ what else?
_ hats. The designers let their fantasy run mad, from the sublime
to the silly.
   For couture _ which is not for average shoppers, but serves
mainly as a strong prototype for what might be found on the racks _
here are ideas to look for:
   Suits are nearly always waist-hugging and short, with jackets
short or long to choose from, and shoulders still shaped, but more
played-down than in the past.
   Saint Laurent's suits hit both day and dressy notes. His
sharply-tailored long jackets with double-breasted or belted safari
effects are worn with knotted chiffon scarves at the neck for
softening the seriousness of the suit.
   Large boater-style hats give his suits a cachet of total chic.
   His dressier suit is plastered with a sequined cubistic design,
elegance and height added by a wrapped fez hat in a different
color, such as purple to contrast with a turquoise satin skirt.
   Dior suits are peppier than ever, but still in the daywear
category. They're charmingly bouncy with stiffened, full skirts,
very small waists and the crowning touch of tiny perched boater
hats.
   Lagerfeld at Chanel has brought back some great Chanel ideas in
suits that are just above the knee _ terrific white tweeds bordered
in bicolored ribbon piping. The topper? For this spring's touch,
it's a large banded straw hat overturned like a salad bowl.
   His slinky long suits are harbingers of next winter; he says
they're definitely coming back. This is glorious news for those who
want to hide their knees. They look authoritative in checked and
solid ensembles with long tulip-wrapped jackets, and the salad-bowl
hat becomes bigger than ever.
   Budding out into springtime dressy looks, Nini Ricci showed
loads of suits with layers of ruffles on skirts, dressy jackets
fitted with a little padding on the shoulders, big stand-out peplum
effects on long jackets.
   Polka dots in these flirtatious clothes are often matched with a
big dotted sunhat.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's silk suits come right out of the hothouse
for spring, with flowers all over them _ maybe teaming black and
white with bright flower prints in skirts, lapels and cuffs in
ultra-fitted suits. And of course, the big-brimmed garden-party hat
nearly eclipses the shoulders with flowers.
   More about hats: Solidly sane or simply crazy, they add a fillip
to any outfit, and lots of fun to the fashion party. Sailor hats
are a favorite at Louis Feraud. Maryll Lanvin opts for little
flower baskets to top her fussily feminine short outfits in a
collection based on her ``secret garden.''
   With flowers in patterns, appliques and even sleeve shapes in
these collections, naturally flowered hats are de rigueur.
   Pierre Cardin practically made a whole outfit with his gigantic
yellow wildflower chapeau covering the model's face, if not her
body _ which was clad in a slinging black mini.
   Kal Lagerfeld added an original touch to his Chanel collection
with the dashing multi-layered straw hat fluted in waves like a
seashell, but shaped more like a flounced stand-out skirt.
   Marc Bohan at Dior branched out into tongue-in-cheek fantasy by
pairing a feathery fright wig with all the allure of a jungle
``Hottentot'' to go with a draped zebra-striped dress.
   And in the devil-may-care vein, wonder boy Christian Lacroix
matched zany hats to some of his fanciful outfits. For a circus
look, he topped a puffy-skirted short dress with a towering tube
slightly curved for laughs. In a sunny beach-inspired mood, he
shaped a straw hat like a whorled sea-snail.
   With these showy or relatively safe toppers, there are plenty of
choices to try on and take home from the hat bar.
   But make sure you get the quick lift you'd get at a cocktail bar
_ rather than a hangover.

   Short or long skirts, fitted or trapeze coats _ the
fashion capital saw several silhouettes during the winter
ready-to-wear fashion circus.
   As fashion sails into the 1990s, the passage may be a bit rough
for women looking for direction and designers who don't seem to know
where to turn.
   But the good news is that individuals are truly free to choose
their style, whether in pants and skirts or jackets and coats. And
there is no evidence of designers conspiring to put women into
stylishly ridiculous gear.
   Those fed up with the skirt-length dilemma may just abandon the
skirt altogether and wear a beautiful hacking jacket or dressier
model over opaque tights as Lagerfeld displayed at both his own and
at the Chanel collection, with an elegant bow to the 1960s.
   Elsewhere, skirts were the familiar short lengths to just above
the knee, or nearly ankle-length in trumpet shapes, pleated or
handsome in a circle of leather at Ungaro.
   Christian Lacroix went his own eccentric way, showing softly
feminine silhouettes and his favorite flowing trapeze styles. Some
loved his loud patchwork looks for ready-to-wear; others were
dazzled by his more expensive ``Luxe'' collection, shimmering with
Byzantine splendor.
   Shoulders were softened or reduced to natural proportions in
feminine silhouettes that marked the waist without undue emphasis.
   The new long jacket was gently fitted, sometimes with a
martingale belting the back, while some were asymmetrical in front,
or outlined in bold piping. Yet others appeared in swallow-tail or
cutaway style.
   Snug spencers, battle jackets and boleros shared the honors for
diminutive jacket styles.
   From the men's wardrobe but looking handsomely feminine were
pinstriped bankers' suits at Hanae Mori and the straight tweed
trousers pleated at the waist by master tailors Yves Saint Laurent
and Jean-Louis Scherrer.
   Long redingotes and short hooded duffel jackets looked terrific,
but Paris also offers some handsome belted trenches, lounging coats
or car coats in luxury cashmere or wool blends _ sometimes collared
and lined with generous lashings of fur.
   Capes were a big item at Saint Laurent and Patrick Kelly, whose
Little Red Riding Hood was a show-stealer. And Italians Angelo
Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli placed their models in cocoon coats.
Gigli's fabulous Byzantine-embroidered cocoon made news over his
outfits in butterfly-light fabrics.
   The color spectrum zoomed from a range of darks _ especially
chocolate brown and charcoal _ to autumnal Beaujolais, cognac,
caramel, gold, mustard, olive, forest green, and misty shades of
lavender and pink.
   Claude Montana's collection brought out hues of blue, from
glacier to deep petrol in his trouser suits.
   But there were hot colors, too, and those who love red will be
happy, as every shade pepped up the runways, from garnet,
fire-engine or poppy to orange-coral, fuchsia and magenta.
   The fabrics gave new softness to the clothes, with flecked
tweeds, big and bold glen or windowpane grid plaids, looking peppy
when placed on the diagonal.
   Butter-soft leather, calfskin or suede gave the appeal of luxury
to many outfits _ remarkable when appliqued with arabesque designs
on short Yves Saint Laurent jackets.
   A taste for exoticism ran to wild-animal prints, done in various
styles and fabrics at Hanae Mori, Scherrer, Lacroix and Kelly. But
the only true furs seen were fox, vicuna, Mongolian lamb and mink.
   Montana's mink was amazing, dyed in his favorite blues and ridged
to look like chenille or corduroy. Otherwise coats looked
appealingly warm in bright mohairs or Shetland.
   Wool and silk jerseys were used generously in softer styles _
especially in dresses, which made a modest comeback for day wear.
Knits often had ethnic overtones, black and white at Chanel,
startlingly bright at Lacroix.
   For late-day, the designers came up with some stunning cocktail
suits or dresses with jackets _ all fit to sup at the Ritz. Among
the most memorable: Chanel's lightly fitted gold corduroy-ridged
lame jacket over a satin-piped wrapped skirt topped with floppy
satin bows.
   Black velvet gave opulent allure to day or evening clothes, and
crimped panne or cut velvet added old-fashioned charm to much of the
evening wear.
   In fact, fabrics for after sunset were so luxurious that they
defined the lines of the outfit. Satin and slithery crepe de chine
were favorites for slinky dinner gowns or pajamas.
   Black silk ``grain de poudre'' was used in all versions of the
``smoking'' or tuxedo style _ still a wardrobe staple, whether with
pants or a skirt.
   Sheer chiffon revealed body lines, while iridescent taffeta
lightly puffed around it in other models. Lame fabrics and
embroidery made evening wear look bewitchingly shimmering, sometimes
sexy, but never glitzy.
   And the lame brocades at houses like Hanae Mori, Lacroix and
Saint Laurent shone with an extra dash of exoticism as the designers
went at least partly to the Far East, Byzantium or North Africa for
inspiration.

   Yves Saint Laurent won a long, standing ovation
Wednesday as he waltzed down the runway, kissing his models after a
show of summer haute couture featuring clean, colorful classics as
only he can make.
   The crowd's enthusiasm contrasted with Tuesday night's debut of
ready-to-wear wizard Claude Montana as haute couturier for the
celebrated house of Lanvin, a sad moment in which Montana seemed
out of his element.
   ``Yves Saint Laurent was more to the couture point,'' said
fashionable Paloma Picasso. ``I loved his evening wear, with so
many ideas and such fabulous color combinations, as usual.''
   Saint Laurent's day wear was both striking and wearable. It
centered on sharp white, ivory or navy ottoman or shantung suits _
including sleek pants or short skirts with tailored jackets.
   Disregarding fashion critics who tell him to discard shoulder
pads, Saint Laurent still shows his daytime clothes neatly padded
out to give shape. But the blouses underneath have softer shapes in
scoop-necked satin or organza models, with cap or raglan sleeves.
   He dedicated many models to past or present entertainment stars.
Some looked downright odd, like the frog-buttoned black gazar coat
over a pants suit dedicated to Rita Hayworth.
   But his homage to his home in Morocco was a simple white satin
sheath topped by a stunning jacket that made the dress. Engineered
by master embroiderer Francois Lesage, it was an extravaganza of
mirror sequins, beads and crystals.
   In easy-to-wear daytime lines, Saint Laurent turned out a soft
midnight blue silk chemise dress with big white buttons and several
silk shirt waists in jungle-panther prints.
   His faultless use of fabric and color went from slinky little
cream satin ``Mademoiselle de Paris'' short tea dresses to a fresh
blue plaid organdy dance dress with puffy sleeves and deep
decollete.
   Montana, by contrast, lacked the elegant elaboration of haute
couture. ``It was pure Montana,'' tersely commented Ellin Saltzman,
corporate fashion director of R.H. Macy Inc.
   Not that the clothes were bad; they had Montana's original
touch, and the great ready-to-wear creator of blousons put on lots
of them in luxury fabrics such as pink-lined copper satin over lean
linen pants.
   But the poor reception would seem a setback for Midland Bank,
which took over Lanvin last year and chose Montana to lead the
couture creation. Some observers thought Montana had done better
collections under his own label.
   The billowy white short gazar ``trench coats'' had Montana
cachet. Brown and earthy colors like khaki, tobacco, chocolate and
clay were featured in luxury fabrics.
   Montana based his silhouette on lean pants and jodhpurs, with
most interest in the toppers like a striped sequined shortie duffel
coat over navy shorts.
   But the audience looked mainly perplexed, with some sniffing
that the combinations just did not make a couture look. Rich
clientele who usually love Lanvin are unlikely to go for the
austere evening wear, with spider web see-through effects on top.
   However, lovely late-day ideas in fabulous fabrics were paraded
at the young couture house of Lecoanet-Hemant.
   The clothes were form-fitting, with clever draping, insertion of
elaborate lace touches under waistlines, lashings of white organza
on collars or skirt flounces adding dashes of fun.
   A typical little sexy cocktail outfit paired an asymmetrical
fitted jacket over a tiny lean coral leather skirt.
   Designer Didier Lecoanet also worked with new raffia lace trim
and gold braid effects in the bright outfits. Other summery touches
were in the mother-of-pearl shell embroideries.
   With some cutouts revealing skin for summer, plenty of bouncy
evening wear with short skirts in front and train effects in back,
the festive outfits in light organza, brocade, taffeta faille and
gazar were truly worthy of the haute couture label.
   The clothes, costing many thousands of dollars per outfit, are
mainly for show. Only about 2,000 women regularly buy couture,
which is meant to power the fashion houses' other activities, from
accessories to perfumes.

   The good news about styles for the early 1990s is
that they seem to be aimed at women with minds of their own, rather
than at sheepish fashionplates to be herded into ridiculous garb to
look trendy.
   There's a vast choice in the offerings to send the 1980s out in
style. The clothes are hardly revolutionary, but the best are timely
and as freshly appealing as champagne.
   Designers are letting go of their recent visions of bouncy,
ruffly little girls in poufs, as well as slinky vamps.
   Finally, they're thinking of women who work, travel and like to
feel easy and pretty in whatever they choose. Whether the clothes
are based on masculine styles or are all dressed up for evening,
they are presented with an eye to both ease and elegance.
   Silhouettes and fabrics are softer in these new clothes, with a
light touch of body-consciousness in the structuring. Shoulders are
padded for shape but never dominate.
   Skirt lengths are barely relevant, though quite long and above
the knee are the younger-looking norms. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
dismisses any discussion of skirt lengths as being ``for old
crones.'' His answer to youth is to show some outfits without any
skirt at all _ simply tights under handsome jackets.
   Trousers are a welcome solution, though the wide A-line look has
been cut back to somewhat straighter lines _ on the dressy side in
suits _ with waist tucking, as at Saint Laurent and Jean-Louis
Scherrer.
   Jackets are starred everywhere. They range from very long styles,
flattering as they cover the derriere, to snug spencers, battle
jackets and boleros. Details may be strong in piping, zigzag
fastening, little belts or vents at the back.
   And several designers give fantasy touches with swallowtail or
cutaway styles in dressier models.
   Coats are another big story. If you like trench or belted
``bathrobe'' styles, you'll find handsome ones for fall.
   Italians designers like Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli ``cocoon'' their
models in sumptuous coats. Tarlazzi's camel-colored wrap with a
bright lining is remarkable. Gigli's opulent Byzantine cocoons are
so colorful they seem to have already matured into butterflies.
   Christian Lacroix plays with the cape theme in loud color
combinations with his short suits or in more subdued styles to evoke
the England of Vita Sackville-West and the literary Bloomsbury set.
   Capes are glamorous at Saint Laurent and hot numbers at Patrick
Kelly, where little caped riding hoods are as fun as they are
colorful.
   As classic suits have come back into focus in the fashion
picture, so have soft dresses, looking better than ever as buttoned
coat dresses, shirtdresses and little shifts.
   Fabrics are important for these stylishly soft clothes, making
them more fluid and sensual than ever _ even the flecked caviar
tweeds. Large plaids, stripes and houndstooth checks offer new
choices at Christian Lacroix, Scherrer and elsewhere.
   Synthetics such as fake furs and wool or silk blends are looking
better than ever. And the new softer, lighter woolens are a boon to
travelers, who'd rather arrive not looking rumpled.
   Folk art is making a chic comeback with Lacroix's favorite
Provencal motifs or kilim rug designs, as well as the handsome black
and white Chanel knits borrowed from Indian weaves.
   Scherrer and Hanae Mori are keen on exotic animal prints and
weaves, and Scherrer's feather patterns add a light touch as well.
   Look for temptingly light jerseys, cashmeres, and knits in cables
and other textures this season, along with soft flannel and
broadcloth. The new tweed and serge don't scratch.
   The up-to-date gold, mustard, olive and forest green. Lavender
and deep purple or pink add a heathery touch to autumn wardrobes.
   But Paris isn't timid about color. The designers are prodigious
in their use of red _ everything from deep raspberry or garnet to
cardinal, orange-coral, fuchsia, fire engine or flame. These also
mix well with deep brown, purple or black.
   The evening scene means a transformation from workaday outfits to
splendidly feminine clothes for cocktails at the Ritz or dinner at
Maxim's. Black is still reliable for sexy little lace or velvet
numbers, and never before have silk ``grain de poudre'' tuxedo
outfits with pants or skirts looked so attractively varied or
feminine.
   But overall, we're seeing more late-day color, in decollete or
``bustier'' dresses with practical little jackets.
   Lame and brocade give dazzle to clothes for welcoming in 1990 _
especially the Japanese flower-print patterns at Hanae Mori, and the
Byzantine motifs at Lacroix, Gigli and elsewhere.
   Scene-stealing hats for these glamorous clothes are Lacroix's
``mad hatter'' chapeau, his big buccaneer hat, and large-brimmed
skimmers at Chanel. Turbans, berets and fur toques are also good
head warmers as well as fashionable.

   Hubert de Givenchy's summer ready-to-wear show
Friday burst out with lovely and wearable styles. This past master
of couture made the luxury clothes look very expensive, which they
are.
   It was a gilded collection, featuring gold threads in the first
knit items right through gilt nailheads all over, plus gold lame
shining through the colorful silk print dinner dresses at the end.
   On a new youth kick, the man who invented Audrey Hepburn's best
``gamine'' styles for her films more than 30 years ago gives his
latest styles modern updates. Among the youngest: a strapless
cable-knit top with a shortie black tulip-wrap skirt rimmed in gold
button details.
   His ballooning silky harem pants looked refreshing this week.
Everybody else is showing pants that look as though they'd been
molded on the model.
   Givenchy showed many well-cut straight trousers with good
cardigan and cable-knit tops, or jackets cut long and straight or
rather full. The fine poplins, linens and plenty of gold buttons
should please the rich set of a certain age.
   Younger fans will like his airy organza dresses and
off-the-shoulder minis in harlequin or bold fruit and flower
prints.
   The serpent theme gliding through a few collections here looks
gaily-colored on bright leather belts, narrow skirts, sleeve
details.
   Karl Lagerfeld also aims for younger looks, continuing his leggy
themes with good jackets and loose tops he started last year.
   Some of the best of this slim-leg look topped by flowing jackets
or cape effects came out in silky jersey fabrics in colors ranging
from subtle linden green or beige to salmon.
   Lagerfeld's pants are cigarette-slim, or simply cotton tights.
The young, but not very flattering, favorite style is to cut off
the dark tights at various lengths along the leg, showing bootees
below.
   Lots of ideas popped up from little apron outfits with shirred
waists right through to plaid jackets of all lengths and cuts worn
over the tights with matching plaid small boots.
   Bright piping on asymmetrical little dresses or sleeveless white
jackets had a certain young charm, along with the buttoned plastron
effects over short linen dresses in bright red or sky blue.
   Lagerfeld also went in for some graphic and check effects, using
checked sheer wraps over maillot bathing suits, and sequined
checkerboard decor for the evening wear in trapeze topped minis or
slinky sheaths.
   Bernard Perris also went all-out for graphic prints and sequined
late-day wear, in minis, long pants, and easy toppers.
   This designer has a raft of summer ideas, ranging from lace-up
safari styles to neon-striped graphics and body-molding leather
outfits in hot shades of vermilion, bright blue and cyclamen.
   His luscious sheer white embroidered blouses with tight sequined
black pants and gold belts evoked a brassy pirate set to swing at
the disco.
   Thierry Mugler put on a show worthy of a striptease nightclub,
but not all went smoothly.
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, and Culture
Minister Jack Lang were among those who waited nearly two hours in
sauna-type heat waiting for the show to begin.
   Before Mugler wound up with a nearly nude Diana Ross (with
chunky glass just decently covering the strategic points and a
fuchsia tulle cape), he'd brought out several other Imam and other
famous models, clothed in outrageous costumes.
   It was mainly lycra and skin, plus a few little bunnies in
bloomer-playsuits, and even a Chinese-lantern outfit in acid shades
of pink and green.
   The rare true dress or suit was applauded, in one case a
pleasantly draped white sheath as worn by famed model of the 1970s,
Lauren Htton.
   Another audience came back later to see Madonna swan down the
catwalk. But most observers agreed: Mugler should either make
clothes and show them as such or take up showbiz as his real
profession.

   British designers have reinvented the Sixties with
a sexy, snappy '90s swing for next spring and summer.
   Nostalgia for the '60s isn't surprising for the country that
invented the miniskirt. But the designers didn't wallow in it. They
pushed it forward into the very modern Nineties with some of the
best collections seen here in years.
   The British look for 1991 is short, simple and sexy.
   The sportswear influence is strong, with cropped jackets and
shorts the hot favorites. But the big news is that dresses are
back, especially skimpy shifts ala Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and
Audrey Hepburn.
   It's definitely going to be a white summer in Britain, though
the color palette runs from black and navy to summer pastels,
occasionally vivid tropical hues, and a smattering of the bright
and bold prints featured in Milan.
   ``It's a '90s version of simplicity dressing,'' said designer
Benny Ong. ``I think the '60s heralded the innocence of it, and the
'90s makes a full circle and says now we have arrived. I think the
difference is, it's a realized woman who is dressing now - and
there is a choice.''
   Designers who lived through the '60s - Caroline Charles, Edina
Ronay and Jean Muir - and those too young to remember - Arabella
Pollen, Jasper Conran and Bruce Oldfield - showed very individual,
wearable collections with an accent on youth at shows over the
weekend and on Monday.
   Caroline Charles did trapeze-line coats and short little shifts,
some in black and white prints, set off by Jackie Kennedy-style
pillbox hats and big sunglasses.
   Arabella Pollen did her sexiest collection yet, featuring
houndstooth check jackets worn with hot pants or hipster miniskirts
and minishifts for evening decorated with pieces of cut mirror. ``A
sort of neon Hong Kong,'' the designer said.
   Bruce Oldfield featured a pared-down look with fluid nautical
print silk shifts, trapeze dresses over slinky jersey bodysuits,
and glamorous asymmetrical sand-colored chiffons with gilt chains
setting off the bust or derriere.
   Paul Costello did his classic linen separates in sherbet colors
and a lovely white linen shift but his back-to-front jacket dresses
in shiny brocades were less successful.
   Betty Jackson mixed figure-hugging pants with loose jackets and,
with an eye to the not-so-young, did some knee-length shifts. Edina
Ronay featured mint and pink pastel sequins for evening with
chiffon and raw silk in the same colors. Jasper Conran's lean and
fluid classically tailored jackets, shorts and short knife-pleated
skirts were back on the catwalk.
   Rifat Ozbek, who has the biggest international clout, opted for
a video presentation instead of a catwalk show. Titled
``Afrodizzia,'' it featured hot African colors, sequins and prints
as well as Rasta ragamuffins in African print leggings and rough
linen tops embroidered with compact discs.
   London also kept its reputation for the wild and wacky.
   Vivienne Westwood, who originated punk fashion and won this
year's Designer of the Year, marched to her own tune in her ``Cut,
Slash and Pull'' collection. It featured very demure '40s-style
tailored suits with midi-skirts alongside slashed and ripped denim
shorts and dresses and shocking bikinis and shorts embellished with
bow-tied phallic symbols.
   Westwood, honored Monday night at an award ceremony at Royal
Albert Hall, developed the punk look and incorporated anarchy into
fashion. One of Britain's most unorthodox and influential
designers, she has designed for the Sex Pistols, Boy George and
Bananarama.
   Pam Hogg's very sexy cotton bustiers, peek-a-boo catsuits, and
short-shorts in dark red, smoked green and mauve, were worn by
models with shaved heads and a wide grey stripe across their eyes.
   Workers For Freedom, the design duo of Graham Fraser and Richard
Nott who won the 1989 Designer of the Year award, picked ``Delicate
Bondage'' for their theme. Some models were strapped into soft
knee-length dresses with leather harnesses. Others wore brightly
printed kimono styles and shirts with evil eyes.
   Body Map's body-hugging ``Square'' collection showed the
influence of Mondrian prints. Ghosts featured clinging minis in
lime and tangerine.
   Red or Dead showed a short red playsuit in synthetic rubber
diving suit material, shorts with red shield stamps that peel off,
and baby dolls embroidered with ``Kiss Me Quick'' and other
sayings.
   Several designers noted there were very few American buyers and
said it was due to the weak dollar and strong British pound. But
Red or Dead spokeswoman Catherine Morris said it had brought down
its prices on clothes and was ``doing outrageously well in
America.''

<HEAD>Candice Fraiberger's Divinely Dressy Styles for Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candice Fraiberger is her own best model: tall,
slim and totally Parisienne, she is a beautiful blonde who
specializes in dressy clothes to make others look beautiful too.
   Following a modest start four years ago, Fraiberger (pronounced
``fray-bear-jay'') is gradually proving she has an authoritative
flair for creating boutique clothes.
   Her new winter line unveiled last week showed well-cut
sarong-draped skirts, neat boleros with baroque appliqued
embroidery over strapless dresses, draped chiffons, plenty of
sequins and sparkle combined with lace, satin, taffeta and velvet.
   The only criticism of these finished clothes is that some look a
bit too fussy for the French. But so far, that doesn't matter,
because Fraiberger is now better-known in the United States than in
France.
   She regularly travels to posh American department stores, and is
well-known in emporia like Neiman-Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom's.
   Her clothes lack the hard-edge chic of styles by someone like
Jacqueline de Ribes, another society beauty designing her own label
line _ whose stricter, slinky silhouettes often recall Yves Saint
Laurent.
   But the Fraiberger line has more than a touch of haute couture
and therefore class. It's made in workshops in the Rue
Poissonniere, the heart of the garment district east of central
Paris, and is lovingly finished by seamstresses in the couture
tradition appreciated by connoisseurs.
   The luxury fabrics and detailing put them into a category
superior to ready-to-wear. But in their price-range of $2,000 to
$6,000 dollars per outfit, the clothes are worth watching.
   For price and quality, they compare favorably with lines like
Christian Lacroix's ``luxe,'' whose price tags can be double or
triple Fraiberger's.
   Indeed, with feminine touches like flared umbrella skirts over
crinolines and contrasts of pink and black velvet in embroidered
dresses with decorated matadors' boleros, one sees a definite
Lacroix influence at work here.
   ``Personally I never have time to think about what I wear,''
said Ms. Fraiberger after her small showroom parade of winter
cocktail and evening clothes. ``I'm totally absorbed by what I'm
making for others.''
   But she did look smashing in her black-and-white cotton summer
suit with beaded, embroidered lapels, fitted for elegance with just
a hint of sexiness.
   Paradoxically this ``fortysomething'' lady (who looks at least
15 years younger) has more fans in Houston than in Paris.
   ``I had learned about clothes from working in retail in France,
but it was the Americans who first enjoyed and ordered my styles
when I started my own business,'' said Ms. Fraiberger.
   Married to an investment counselor and mother of two grown
children, Ms. Fraiberger says she is financing her own business,
not backed by any grand consortium as many style creators are today.
   ``Sadly enough, I don't even have a proper boutique yet in
France,'' she said, adding that her friends and those in the know
come to her showroom at Rue Aguesseau, just around the corner from
the fashionable Faubourg Saint-Honore.
   However, she's selling well in style-conscious countries like
Japan and Germany, and is at last attracting favorable comments
from the French fashion press as well.
   ``I think the clothes look very well-made,'' said Christine
Marais, of French Harper's Bazaar.
   ``The feel of dressiness is quite American,'' observed Laurence
Beurdeley, of the glossy fashion magazine ``l'Officiel de la Mode.''
   Ms. Fraiberger says she believes in dressing up rather than
down, and is proud to look spiffy as a bandbox herself.
   ``I think the French are wrong to affect the casual styles seen
so much on the streets here,'' she says. ``It shows a sloppiness of
mind. I understand tourists wearing practical shoes for
sightseeing. But I think women should do their best to be feminine
and elegant.''

   Young, skin-baring and refreshing are the first
messages as ready-to-wear shows for next spring get under way.
   More than 80 designers will be showing for the next week in a
courtyard in the Louvre and elsewhere, spending up to $200,000 for
the larger runway shows.
   There appears to be as much hype and crowd interest as in the
past, despite of market downtrends and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Lolita Lempicka got applause Wednesday for a lilting collection
that featured micro-models with bustiers and bras shaped like
underwear.
   This lingerie trend started out with several houses last season,
and Lempicka took it into a perky ingenue vein, adding lace to
little green or pink satin slip dresses, covering them decently
with peppy short trench coats.
   She, like several other designers showing this week, liked the
look of bare backs crossed by straps, and occasional bare midriffs.
As her forte is suits, she put plenty of pep back into grey flannel
by adding appliqued flower details.
   Some of her shortie prints had a certain 1940s nostalgia with
their fit and head-wraps, though they were far too short for that
period.
   Those wanting to dress up Lolita-style might try some of the
little white dresses decked out in big pearl or silver baubles and
buttons. If they were not in light summer fabrics, they would look
just fine along with the skaters at Rockefeller Center at
Christmas.
   Lempicka showed some safari suits and appealing sailor looks,
turning up already elsewhere as well.
   At Dorothee Bis, the clothes also had a youthful bent - with
shorts, shortie jackets, flaring tent dresses, corsair and longer
pants. They came in red-white-blue linens and kabig, a kind of
smooth broadcloth like that used in pea jackets.
   Paco Rabanne's show in a small Left Bank shop was also a hit for
the younger set who can wear the stretch fabrics and micro-minis.
   The Spanish-born inventor of the chain-mail and metallic dresses
put a witty little flourish on some of his bare-midriff cotton
outfits: they were made of cotton patterned just like his original
metal-plate models of some 20 years ago. Some were even cut and
metal ringed, though the plates were cotton this time.
   Metallic lame stripes in green and warm yellow added late-day
dash to trouser outfits.
   Ishiro Kimijima's collection was one of the most creative so
far. This 61-year-old Japanese brought out a smart group of
beachwear with fishnet inspiration, a good use of raffia, lots of
see-through voile over bikinis or shorts.
   He took Nefertiti and ancient Egypt for some inspiration. But he
also used plastic minis to advantage, and many of the clothes had
seashell and starfish embroideries and decor.
   Kimijima's heavily bewigged mermaids ending the show draped in
strands of lame-lace looked as if they'd just emerged from a golden
seaweed sea.
   Another, younger Japanese, Inoue Jun, showed equally short and
youthful lines for his company called June, July, Auguste, who
showed in a small space on the Right Bank.
   His forte for next summer is in the skimpy but well-cut little
jackets with soft shoulders. They're worn over shortie skirts or
shorts with some longer looks thrown in for good measure. He
concentrates on soft, offbeat pastel shades and blues in a bluejean
vein.
   The house of Lecoanet-Hemant opted out of a big runway show. But
their rack line shown in a hotel display room had some fine ideas
for summer, with plenty of expensive couture touches.
   Stone-washed soft silk suits with soft cuts and short skirts
look quite elegant in either salmon or coral pink, deep navy or
black.
   They also pep up a well cut, easily-fitted dark shantung silk
suit with life-saver embroideries in rust-shaded raffia.
   A fine topper here for a slinky stretch skirt or hostess pyjamas
is the generous acid-green waffled organza blouse with a big collar
and billowing sleeves tied under the elbow.
   One striking innovation is the use of copper-metal threads for a
new fabric in a transparent blouse, typical of Lecoanet-Hemant's
occasional enthusiasm for eccentric but beautiful new fabrics.

<HEAD>Hanae Mori's 35th Anniversary Exhibition a Restrospective on Beauty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanae Mori kicked off her 35th anniversary
exhibition Friday with a parade of most-loved creations celebrating
her sense of beauty and elegance.
   The show previewing an exhibition of the works of Asia's only
designer of haute couture was held in the Hanae Mori building in
Tokyo's swank Omotesando district.
   Many of her 85 favorite creations, ranging from her colorful
Japanese ``happi'' suits of 1981 to her 1989 ``Wave and Butterfly''
dress in silk, carried her colorful trademark.
   The show included only one outfit from the 1960s: a butterfly
dress from her 1968 New York collection presented three years after
the Japanese designer brought her ``pret-a-couture'' line to the
United States.
   She has continued to create the soft and flowing chiffons and
silky butterfly-flower prints that won favor with American
customers, while exploring a wide range of silhouettes and fabrics
in Paris.
   The show and exhibition, which opens July 4, are a rare
retrospective for Mrs. Mori, who said in a recent speech here that
she thought it was ``about time I looked back at my own footsteps.''
   ``I've been doing some philosophical soul-searching about what
fashion is,'' she said. ``Apparel wraps the human drama as it
develops.''
   That drama, she said, is the mystery and allure of how men and
women interact.
   ``As I look back ... I have come to feel that people, especially
women, have changed a great deal,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mori's marriage of Eastern fabrics and tradition, with their
suggestion of hidden beauty, and the Western couturiere's sense of
striking individual beauty, however, seem timeless.
   Unlike avant-garde Japanese designers Issey Miyake and Yohji
Yamamoto, Mori dresses always are classically feminine.
   Mrs. Mori's fabrics always have been sumptuous: silks, rich wools
and glittering sequins. Regal brocades recall more courtly eras.
   Three ballerinas danced through the runway wearing short tafetta
and chiffon ball gowns of 1986: a slinky ``rose ensemble'' from 1977
and flirty ``daisy dresses'' from 1988, all shapely and romantic,
not shocking.
   Mrs. Mori's elegant designs are worn by the wives of Japanese
prime ministers and even Empress Michiko.
   The 1970s, ``an era that wasn't for making women beautiful,''
didn't appeal much to Mrs. Mori. ``Women were not at their best in
terms of beauty,'' she said.
   The 1980s suit her better. ``Nowadays, health and nature is
beautiful,'' she said. ``After all, I'm Japanese ... I like things
fragile and effervescent.''
   Despite her restrospective, Mrs. Mori says looking forward comes
more naturally to her.
   ``I rarely look at the past,'' she said. ``The nature of my work
is to anticipate how people will live in the world to come and stay
a step ahead.
   ``Sometimes I want to make something, but it's too early. So I
put it back in my treasure chest and wait for the right time.''

   Spring fashions will be sealed with a kiss from
the '60s _ but bows and bubbles will replace love beads this time
around.
   The mood is flirty and fun _ romantic and dramatic.
   And body-conscious.
   Short skirts were the most obvious blast from the past as
designers revealed their upcoming lines. The tent dress _ mini, of
course _ was revived by Adrienne Vittadini. Some models piled
plastic bangle bracelets up their arms.
   And there was plenty of Flower Power: frequent floral prints;
skirts curved and layered like upside-down tulips; fabric flowers _
attached as a simple corsage or, ala Betsey Johnson and Bill Blass,
stuck all over the dress.
   But the stark options of the '60s also have been tempered with
plenty of old-style chiffon and elegant silk, along with buoyant
skirts, frothy sleeves, pretty sundresses and even a few bustles.
   Fanciful, pumpkin-shaped bubble skirts appeared frequently,
along with a less-radical version that's been dubbed a ``collapsed
bubble.'' Bob Mackie took bubbles one step beyond, turning them
into bustles, ruffles and stand-up collars.
   Lace, sequins and gleaming, intricate beadwork also made for
after-dark glamour.
   Day or night, black and white still prevailed, along with bold
teal, fuchsia and goldenrod yellow. Polka dots, ruffles, big
buttons and bows cropped up often _ the latter in every conceivable
location. Waists were nipped and accented with wide belts or sashes.
   Shoulders were bared in strapless, bustier sundresses and
off-the-shoulder jackets and dresses.
   When it came to gams, Cathy Hardwick's collection was the
leggiest of the lot. One strapless, green and yellow cotton dress
by Mary Jane Marcasiano was too snug and short for anything but
mincing steps. Ronaldus Shamask also had some shockingly short
selections.
   Ellen Tracy's silk, knee-skimming tulip-shaped skirts were soft
and feminine. Even a few offerings from traditionalist Laura Ashley
crept slightly above the knee.
   To hem or not to hem? The undecided could opt for Bob Mackie's
tight, beaded black dress, featuring a diagonal hem slashed from
knee to thigh. Or try the cookie-cutter hemlines, many to mid-calf,
that spiced the new made-in-America collection by Soviet couturier
Viyacheslav Zaitsev.
   The other alternative _ trousers _ was the opposite of
body-conscious: Perry Ellis' loose, ankle-skimming pants; Donna
Karan's navy pajama pants, teamed with slinky, wrapped tops; Mary
McFadden's flowing palazzo pants, with ridges of delicate mushroom
pleats tumbling from waist to hem; Ronaldus Shamask's high-waisted
pants, shorts or culottes with sashes.
   Only bike pants, like those offered by Adrienne Vittadini, were
slim, and they often were topped with long dusters or tunics.
   Geoffrey Beene favored the jumpsuit, heralding his black, crepe
version with a halter neck and a swimsuit back as ``the new
ballgown.''
   Shorts had fashion flair, too: like Williwear's cuffed,
knee-grazing walking shorts teamed with a double-breasted blazer or
a smartly cropped jacket; Vittadini's mint-green, cuffed shorts
with a bra-top and unstructured jacket.
   The shorts also were part of a new, below-the-waist, layered
look.
   Ashley's two-piece halter dress in a splashy print featured a
wrap-around skirt that unraveled to reveal matching shorts.
Carolina Herrera's billowing, black and white, silk organza skirts
were cut away in front to reveal beaded camisoles and shorts.
   Some designers also layered dresses and skirts with petticoats,
or a second skirt, peeking out from beneath.
   Williwear's eye-catching Egyptian print skirt opened to show a
solid-colored, cotton-eyelet skirt. Johnson's stretchy tube-dress
in black and white gingham was prettied up with a buoyant,
knee-length skirt and can-can slip. Beene's short, sweet, baby-doll
circle skirts were fluffed out with petticoats.
   And just about every designer braved one ensemble that combined
unlikely fabrics or prints. Mary Ann Restivo and Ralph Lauren, for
instance, showed floaty, chiffon skirts with tailored jackets.

FT  22 AUG 92 / How to Spend It: Madrid - slinky, elegant, sexy, overpriced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and ANNA CHRISTENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shopping or going out in Madrid is a big deal. For visitors it is an
expensive city, mainly because the peseta is overvalued. But do not be
frightened. The fish and lobsters at what must be some of Europe's best
seafood restaurants are flown in daily from the coast. Clothes are expensive
but quality has improved as foreign designers have rushed into town and the
locals have responded with new clothes, or derivatives, of their own. Apart
from two department store chains, male and female shopping in Spain are two
distinct activities. Peter Bruce, FT correspondent in Madrid, and his wife,
Anna Christensen, report.
SHE WRITES . . .
A KALEIDOSCOPE of colours tantalises the senses - shocking pink, azure blue,
emerald green, glittering gold, Carmen red, each crinkly, slithery or
sumptuously soft and designed for impact.
This was not the closing ceremony of the Barcelona Olympics. Instead, it was
a shop of Spain's hottest designer, Roberto Verino. The clothes were
dynamite, but I came out empty-handed. They were summer's left-overs and
followed the route to which Spain has stuck with touching faithfulness:
short, tight, slippery, slinky - sexy.
I was not raised for this. I was dressed in twin sets and pearls and
sensible shoes. Yet, soon I am going to be really wicked and, when I do, I
am going to a Spanish designer, probably Verino although there are others
including Jesus del Pozo, Sybilla and Pedro del Hierro to choose from.
Happily, Spanish designers have aligned themselves more closely with the
mainstream of international fashion this year. They are showing flights of
fancy juxtaposed with impeccably-styled classics.
So, if I get cold feet and do not buy Verino's turquoise parka with ostrich
feathers and balloon mini-skirt, I know I will be happy with his classic
camel suit with double-breasted jacket and ankle-revealing straight pants
and, perhaps, the long, flowing evening skirt in slate grey. Loewe, a must
for leather and suede, offers a version of the classic twin set this year.
Before embarking on a shopping spree in Madrid, remember there are two
stumbling blocks to overcome. Spending money should be pleasant, yet there
is a dearth of friendly and helpful staff. If you happen to be female, the
young women who serve you would rather bore holes through you than ask if
you need another size. If you get this treatment, leave.
Second, Madrid is expensive and, normally, there are few bargains. Recently,
I saw a Byblos dress I bought at a sale in London for Pounds 125 selling for
the equivalent of Pounds 275.
Shopping in Madrid centres around Calle Serrano where, in fine weather, I
enjoy watching well-clad Madrilenos promenade. No one pops out in a track
suit and few women even venture out in jeans. On Serrano I visit Max Mara,
Loewe, Boutique Real and Adolfo Dominguez, a designer I favour for his clean
lines and interesting fabrics.
Along the way, you will pass a dizzying array of shoe shops with reasonable
prices. They still lag behind the Italians in quality but they cannot be
beaten for fun seasonal wear. My favourites are Bravo and Los Pequenos
Suizos, both of which offer quality, a wide selection of Spanish and
imported styles, half sizes, and friendly and helpful staff.
I stay away from the antique shops in Calle Lagasca (they are overpriced and
most of the furniture is English) but it is worth looking at the Duran shops
along Serrano. For the best in Spanish furniture, antiques, lace and
ceramics, go to Artespana, which has several shops. But beware: in an
over-priced country, their prices really jar. There is one on Hermosilla,
just up from Serrano and close to the beautiful shop of Spain's premier
interior designer, Gaston y Daniela.
On Claudio Coello, parallel to Serrano, you will find Roberto Verino,
Emporio Armani and Salvador Bachiller, whose classic leather travelling
bags, handbags and shoe collection this year include fanciful zebra-stripe
inlays. I buy my household linen at Linogar or No 47, where the woman will
ask you in which of three weights you would like your white pique summer
bedspread and whether it will cover the pillows or go under them.
Several rather fun antique shops are also on this street and Anmoder is
worth looking at for its Art Noveau exterior, even though its inside is a
bit of a let-down.
As you walk, you will pass cross-streets worth wandering down. One is Calle
Jose Ortega y Gasset, which has Kenzo, Gianni Versace and a wonderful
Spanish boutique, Tres Zetas.
At the Jardin de Serrano, stop in at Abascal for another eye-dazzling
display of colours and textures. There, you may order a unique evening dress
of the type that appears regularly in Spain's glossy gossip magazines (you
need time for fittings, though). Agatha has a superb collection of (mostly
French) costume jewellery. If you want the real thing, Bulgari will give you
pause. Madrid's prestigious men's shop, Azul, is here but for real fun (of
the expensive variety) go to the main shop on Serrano.
At some point, you will want to stroll along the Castellana to savour its
grandness and splendour. You can take your pleasure outside in fine weather
or in the lovely Art Noveau restaurant, El Espejo.
For a truly Spanish break, go to one of the many Mallorca shops (I like the
one on Serrano), where you can enjoy coffee or chocolate, wine, cava and
tapas. Many successful Spanish dinner parties come from behind those glass
cases, as do gifts of ceramic or brass knick-knacks filled with sweets.
There are a few Spanish specialities I cannot live without. The gourmet
olive oils, red peppers, cured Serrano ham, an almond cake called Tarta de
Santiago, coffee Torrefacto-style, turron and Toledo-style marzipan: all
make wonderful gifts if you can bear to give them away.
HE WRITES . . .
I GREW UP up in the sticks in South Africa and, before coming to Madrid four
years ago, had lived only in London (where people wear track suits to
impress each other) and Bonn (where shops close too early for anyone to buy
things).
A pure-bred bumpkin, I mostly window-shop, but rapid improvements in my
Spanish mean I will never again ask a shop assistant for a truck with extra
long sleeves.
There is little point in buying suits in Spain - they are hideously
expensive. On the other hand, this summer's sales have been incredible and a
good man's shop, Blanco Blanco on Calle Marceliano Santamaria, next to the
Real Madrid stadium, has a great blue cotton jacket from Hugo Boss in its
window for about Pounds 30, with more tasty Boss gains inside.
Springfield, a few doors up, is more to my boring taste, though. I like
faded clothes and Springfield (a Spanish company) makes me feel like an
American adventurer every time I walk out of it with another washed denim
shirt or faded grey sweat shirt. Prices now are at rock bottom; good jackets
are going for Pounds 30 or so and sport shirts for about Pounds 15.
A much more expensive 'western' feel is at Charro on Claudio Coello, where I
bought a leather-collared cowpoke jacket for nearly Pounds 200 three years
ago. They have great stuff - yellowing leather gloves and their own jeans.
The Spanish are discovering the great outdoors. I would buy a pair of soft
leather Panama Jack boots or shoes if only they did not have Panama Jack
written all over them in big letters. Instead, I settled last year for a
21-speed Peugeot mountain bike and a beagle puppy - Pta55,000 (Pounds 305)
and Pta80,000 (Pounds 445) respectively from Calmera on Calle Atocha and
Nuestros Amigos los Animales in the La Vaguada shopping mall.
For authentic Spanish furniture, drive about 100km north of Madrid to
Pedraza, a small pueblo. The trip, and lunch at the local parador, are more
than worth it and the town has five or six good shops. A three-drawer pine
chest, about 80 years old, could cost Pounds 1,000.
As for eating and drinking (which is what Madrid was built for), beer and
tapas are best at the bars along the Plaza Santa Ana, just up from the
Palace Hotel. In summer, you can drink until sunrise at sidewalk bars along
the Castellana, but they are so full it takes hours to get service.
Madrid has hundreds of good restaurants although I confine my expeditions to
within a few minutes' walk of my office, just off the Calle Recoletos in the
centre of town. Two doors away is El Borbollon; over the road is a
magnificently-tiled El Espejo. Up the road, on the other side of Serrano, is
Alkalde, for good fish. All of these would cost around Pounds 30 a head for
lunch or dinner with wine.
Easily the very best place to eat in Madrid - and one of the cheapest in the
whole country - is the Centro Cubano on Claudio Coello, a ramshackle haunt
of Cuban exiles. Its fare is simple - lots of black beans, chicken and rice
 -but it goes down very well.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: Rise of the new legging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LEGGINGS could be said to be the new jeans
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
in other words, a staple. There can hardly be a female wardrobe that does
not sport a pair. They are what we put on when we get dressed on auto-pilot
when we're off to potter round the shops.
They can be teamed with skinny rib knits or cropped sweaters if you are
young and lithe, with thigh-covering shirts or sweaters if you are not. With
Lycra they accommodate almost every size and shape. They come dark and
serviceable for everyday, or slinky and velvety for glamour.
But what happens to the legging now that fashion has done a volte-face and
gone all soft and feminine? Like all successful species, the legging has
evolved and adapted itself seamlessly to the new fashion environment and is
still on all the smartest shelves, alive and kicking.
The new-look legging this winter comes in many moods: satin-backed crepe,
silk chiffon, velvet, linen, wool or cotton. The newest are something of a
hybrid - a cross between a legging and a proper pair of trousers. For the
young, slim, trendy and long-legged there is the flare - French Connection
do some marvellously slinky ones in rich dark chocolate and dark blue as
well as black at Pounds 69.99. Hue, as ever on the ball, has some in a thick
matt soft but unclingy nylon/Lycra mix at Pounds 55 a time.
In sporty mode there is even more choice - from Ally Capellino's Hearts of
Oak leggings in ecru ribbed cotton, with something of the elan of a jodhpur,
at Pounds 60 a time to Artwork's beautiful indigo coloured cuffed cotton
jersey versions at Pounds 63.
You will like the look but maybe not the prices. Whereas once leggings
seemed to cost only roughly twice the price of tights nowadays, unless a
plain chain-store version suits you (and Marks and Spencer is still doing
plain classic leggings for about Pounds 16 and its jodhpur versions for
Pounds 19.99) the sky's the limit. However, for comfort they still beat the
classic pair of trousers hands-down.

<HEAD>Britain Mixes Funky Madness With Relaxed, Flowing Styles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associaed Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British designers abandoned power dressing in
their first collections for the 1990s, some returning to the wacky
madness that made London fashions famous and others launching the
decade in a relaxed, flowing style.
   After putting women in status-conscious, super-structured
clothes with big, padded shoulders for several years, British
designers have followed Milan in loosening up their styles for next
summer.
   But there's no uniform look and individuality remains the key
fashion word in the British collections, being shown through
Tuesday.
   ``I would say it's anything flows in the 1990s and
super-structure is out,'' said Bernie Ozer, vice-president of AMC
Corp., the giant New York buying company. ``The structured jacket
is out but jackets in softer varieties and shapes are a must for
the '90s. ... It will also be the decade of the accessory which has
never gotten its proper due.''
   The big names in British fashion _ Rifat Ozbek, Arabella Pollen,
Bruce Oldfield, Edina Ronay and Bellville Sassoon _ turned out some
beautiful clothes. But the big news was in the youth market where
there was a revival of kooky, fun and sometimes off-the-wall
clothes.
   ``The street look here has always been good,'' Ozer said.
``Sometimes it's fashionable to like it. Sometimes it's
unfashionable to like it. It's now in fashion.''
   Bodymap did their first catwalk show in three years on the theme
``Life Is,'' featuring rock stars, drag queens, mini-skirts with
plants and roses, Victorian-style bathing suits and one-shoulder
cycle suits.
   Red or Dead's Space-Baby Collection, which admittedly looks at
the future with ``tongue firmly in cheek,'' was a hit with buyers
including the U.S. chain Nordstrom and New York's Trash and
Vaudeville boutique and Los Angeles' Roppongi boutique.
   It features see-through plastics appliqued with a logo of a
smiling space-baby in a plastic helmet, micro shorts, skirts and
jackets cheekily cut away to reveal flesh _ the skirts with two
waistbands and two transparent space-baby belts.
   ``It's just a fresh approach rather than all the power-dressing
that's been around for years,'' said 28-year-old co-owner Wayne
Hemingway. ``It's bright, cheerful, fun and the reaction has been
brilliant.''
   Vivienne Westwood, the 48-year-old godmother of British fashion
innovation who instituted the punk cult during the 1970s and is a
nominee for Designer of the Year, showed her collection ``Britain
Must Go Pagan'' Monday evening. Though it had its wild moments,
many buyers said it was one of her most commercial ranges.
   It certainly was not for anyone with an extra ounce of fat,
featuring very sexy body-clinging catsuits, one-shoulder
mummy-style knit mini-dresses, and skimpy shorts, one pair with an
outrageous gold phallus. Many designs were decorated with
rhinestone chains, some draped in tiers down to the floor and
others dangling from the calf.
   Pam Hogg, a young Scottish designer who used to show with
Hyper-Hyper, did her first solo collection, another very sexy show
with bras like belts, leggings and skin-tight bustier tops, lace-up
corsets, and clinging trousers with stretch patent leather in back
and a series of straps in front with a bikini peeping through.
   Much of the media and buyer attention focused on the six
contenders for the Designer of the Year that is being presented
Tuesday night by Princess Diana.
   Rifat Ozbek, last year's winner and a hot contender again this
year, abandoned his love of color for a stunning all-white
collection called ``New Age Nirvana,'' which won raves from the
critics.
   His quest for purity features silky knit jogging pants, softly
wrapped skirts topped by loose and layered tunics, shimmering,
sequinned, off-the-shoulder dresses, boleros and hooded bomber
jackets _ one studded with crystal rhinestones, the yin yang symbol
and the appliqued message ``Release It.''
   Workers for Freedom, the design duo of Graham Fraser and Richard
Nott who were also nominated, did linen shirts trimmed in lace,
frilled and fitted waistcoats over soft, cropped silk trousers and
ankle-length chiffon skirts strewn with artificial flowers and worn
with slinky silk tank tops.
   Nominee Katharine Hamnett did a raunchy 1950s baby doll
collection and fellow contender Joe Casely-Hayford chose the four
elements _ earth, air, fire and water _ for his show.
   The Spanish gypsy inspired Arabella Pollen, one of Princess
Diana's favorite designers and another contender, who showed soft,
short shirt-jackets and decorative waistcoats as well as natural
linens and her perennial little sexy dresses and suits.
   ``I think everyone is fed up with power dressing,'' she said.
``A lot of softer things are going well.''

<HEAD>Italian High Fashion Gets Boost, Grace Jones Takes Dip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valentino, a new fashion pavilion and a show down
the famed Spanish Steps combined to lift the sagging image of
Rome's high fashion week.
   Sixteen of Italy's leading designers sent actors and
international models down the steps in their most beautiful
creations for the upcoming fall and winter.
   The hour-long show Thursday night, which ended with a fireworks
display, was beamed live thoughout Europe and to the Soviet Union
for the first time.
   Grace Jones created the biggest splash by frolicking in the
fountain at the bottom of the steps in a slick black leotard before
donning a luxurious blue-dyed sable fur by Fendi.
   The top Italian designers, who also include Mila Schoen, Rocco
Barocco, Galitzine, Laug, Lancetti and Balestra, produce beautiful
styles enhanced by sumptuous fabrics and artisan detailing. But the
Italian couture scene has lost the excitement of the 1960s when the
fashion creativity of such designers as the Fontana Sisters,
Capucci and Shubert, went hand in hand with the wild spirit of the
Dolce Vita.
   Rome's loss has been Paris' gain. Not only have their own
designers combined to make the ``Made in France'' label the queen
of couture but they also have lured some of the best Italian talent
into their fashion net.
   Valentino, who strayed from Italy a decade ago to present his
ready-to-wear collection in Paris, has a second showing of his
couture during the French fashion week, meaning that the bulk of
his international customers need not make an extra trip to Rome to
admire his wears.
   But Valentino swears he won't abandon the Italian capital. He
has just restored another wing of his Rome headquarters, a 16th
century building in the shadow of the Spanish Steps and this week
announced a collaboration agreement with the Italian maufacturing
company Gruppo Finanziario Tessile to produce his high fashion
collections.
   The Italian fashion chamber set up a pavilion in Villa Borghese
park for the shows.
   As his maid of honor for the Spanish Steps gala, Valentino chose
Italian actress Ornella Muti in a red silk gown. Carroll Baker,
famous for creating the scanty pajama vogue after her film ``Baby
Doll,'' had trouble inching her way down in a slinky evening gown
by Sarli.
   Outfits presented during the week included Lancetti's rich
velvet gowns with passementerie trimming inspired by the Italian
Renaissance; glittery black sequined gowns by Rocco Barocco;
elegant suits, blouses and penthouse party gowns by the late Andre
Laug; and sexy black evening gowns by Mila Schoen.
   But the winning card of the fashion week was the stunning show
of the maestro, Valentino, who outdid himself with a fall-winter
collection inspired by the geometric designs of the Vienna Liberty
school at the beginning of the century.
   The perfect little black dress in velvet or chiffon or a
combination of both was the star of the show, at times worn under
an extravagant floor-length white coat with black geometric
embroidery.
   For daytime, Valentino favors his trademark neat little suit,
adorning it either with velvet geometric detail or colored pompon
buttons in tufts of wool or silk gleaned from the fabric of the
suit.

<P>
Judy Barry cringes whenever she sees two women at an elegant black-tie affair 
wearing identical gowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed for them," Barry says. "I've seen women seated at the same 
table in matching dresses." 
</P>
<P>
Barry is so determined to avoid a similar fate, she designs her own glamorous 
gowns, traveling to Hong Kong to oversee production of her sequined sheaths. 
</P>
<P>
Her friends, seeing Barry show up at galas in one slinky, sparkling dress after 
another, commissioned her to make gowns for themselves. Barry, a Newport Beach 
resident, now sells her one-of-a-kind dresses under the name Judy Lee's Designs 
and Classic Editions. 
</P>
<P>
"No two gowns are alike," Barry says. "I don't like to see myself standing 
there across the room." 
</P>
<P>
Barry's gowns do have one thing in common: Every inch of fabric is doused in 
sequins, beads, rhinestones and pearls. 
</P>
<P>
Some dresses have three-inch drops of beads dangling from capped sleeves and 
hems. Others have beaded leaves or flowers appliqued around the shoulders, hem 
or bodice. 
</P>
<P>
Like Madonna in "Dick Tracy," women pour themselves into these breathless 
gowns. Barry has never designed anything with a full skirt or gathers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be fairly thin," she admits. They're perfect for Barry, a tall, 
slender brunette. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her gowns accentuate the body with high slits, keyhole backs and low 
V-neck fronts. Some have scalloped borders around the neckline or hem. 
</P>
<P>
One off-the-shoulder gown has pink beaded flowers and painted silk leaves 
floating on a sea of pale peach sequins. A strapless royal blue sheath has 
swirls of emerald sequins and a scalloped edge bordering its diagonal hemline. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Barry's glitzy dresses are long. She designed a halter dress in a 
leopard print made of hand-painted silk and sequins that falls to the knees, 
with a simple bolero-style jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Barry began creating her Bob Mackie-style gowns five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I were going to a lot of black ties, and you really have to 
shop around a lot to find a gown that's different," she says. "Everywhere you 
go, you see the same dresses. They're all beautiful, but you know out of 400 
people someone will be wearing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
So began her search for affordable glitz. On a trip to Hong Kong with her 
mother, Barry discovered a shop that sold jars filled with beads. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured someone back home would be able to sew them on a dress. So I bought 
a 5-pound bag of every kind of bead in the shop and brought them back here." 
</P>
<P>
When her search for a tailor who did bead work proved futile, she hired a 
researcher to track down someone in Hong Kong who made beaded garments. The 
search led her to Paula Soo (her name, coincidentally, is pronounced sew). 
</P>
<P>
Soo worked with Barry to come up with designs for the dresses, then turned the 
sewing and beadwork over to a team of 75 to 100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a couple of the gowns back and my friends said, 'This is wonderful 
-- can you do one for me?"' 
</P>
<P>
Barry now sends sketches of gowns to Soo, then meets with her in Hong Kong when 
the garments are half completed to position appliques on the dresses and make 
changes or alterations. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Barry had to steer Soo away from "Oriental-looking" designs. Mandarin 
collars and sequined dragons don't sell well in Orange County, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Barry also found that her initial desire to make gowns in solid colors didn't 
work -- the detail was lost and the dresses didn't sell. Eventually Soo and 
Barry hit upon the right formula -- colorful appliques or beaded patterns on a 
straight sheath. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic dress is the same, but then we add capped or long sleeves and beads 
that dangle or appliqued leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Customers can help design their dresses, choosing the style, colors and type of 
beaded appliques. The gowns cost from $450 for a short dress to $1,700 for an 
elaborate, long gown. 
</P>
<P>
While Barry doesn't call herself a designer, she has a knack for altering and 
improving the look of any garment. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I buy clothes, even if they're off the rack, they always go to the 
tailor," she says. "I usually change the collars and I always change the 
neckline and the buttons. I taper everything for a much more fitted look. 
</P>
<P>
"I own nothing with a flared skirt." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally her experiments with clothes lead to a new creation. 
</P>
<P>
"I always come up with these ideas I like, not knowing anyone else will like 
them too." 
</P>
<P>
That's how she invented her magnetic shoulder pads, which attach to the outside 
of a garment instead of the inside. Barry can turn a plain jacket into a 
Michael Jackson-style blazer by adding shoulder pads decorated with gold fringe 
and braid, or she can dress up a simple black chemise by attaching velvet 
shoulder pads draped with jet beads. 
</P>
<P>
To attach the pads without sticking pins through the garment, Barry decided to 
bury magnets inside each pad so it would cling to another magnetic shoulder pad 
worn underneath the garment. The pads have sold at Nordstrom and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Barry's gowns have become so popular, she's trying to keep her "fun 
hobby" from turning into a full-blown business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she made six trips to Hong Kong to pick up gowns. This year she wants 
to limit the number of trips to two or three. With each trip, she brings back 
25 to 30 gowns, shipping them in boxes because the sequins make them too heavy 
to carry. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get back from my trip people call and ask, 'When are you going to 
unpack?' I've never had a problem selling the gowns." 
</P>
<P>
For now, she's resisting the idea of selling her dresses through a department 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like knowing who my dresses go to," she says.

<HEAD>New Japanese Talent Jumps Gun On Winter Shows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Jun in designer's name and Auguste are correct.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big ready-to-wear winter fashion shows don't
begin until mid-March, but a new Japanese designer named Jun Inoue
jumped the gun with a low-key collection of coordinates.
   His adorable trapeze mini-coats, well-cut buttoned jodhpur
pants, beautiful fabrics and excellent cuts, displayed Wednesday,
would be good news in any collection for next winter.
   Jun Inoue, working under the name ``Jun, July, Auguste,'' is
just the latest Japanese designer trying to make it in Paris.
   Kenzo came into his own over 18 years ago, Hanae Mori turned
into a ``French'' couturiere about 20 years ago, Issey Miyake has
shown in Paris for years, and Rei Kawakubo stunned her audiences
with clothes shot full of holes for ``Comme des Garcons'' more than
a decade ago.
   Opting for a quiet show in the cellar of his small boutique near
the Louvre that will open officially next summer, Jun was modest
but hopeful for a big future in Paris and all over the world.
   ``Paris is the place to be,'' said Jun, 37. ``I've lived here 15
years, and get my inspiration here.''
   ``I thought he did a wonderful job,'' said Jean-Paul Gaultier,
for whom Jun worked eight years. The way-out wonder boy of French
fashion, Gaultier said he liked the details like a shirred
mini-dress in soft fabrics worn over a silky turtleneck undershirt.
   Inoue's small collection was smart and young in every way. He
led off with well-cut black cuffed shorts worn with a high-waisted
long jacket nipped in by a drawstring with a high waistline, the
outfit topped with a jaunty sailor's beret.
   The high waistline, often buckled at the side, was a kind of
signature for Jun's leggy look that was always paired with matching
or contrasting opaque tights _ exclusive productions for Jun _ and
little flat suede oxords.
   While the gamine mini look was young, there was a lot for women
of all ages who want a bit of originality in their closets. The
softly belted trench coats, the checked pants suits with narrow
jodhpur-style trousers buttoned up from the ankle could be worn by
almost anyone.
   Details can make or break a collection, and Jun found some
excellent touches. His mother-of-pearl buttons with a dangling
pearl to doll up dark blazers and coats are not seen anywhere else.
   One dress sure to make a hit was a camisole slip-like mini
number with a heavy eyelet embroidered decor on the top and hem,
worn with a slinky T-shirt top and contrasting tights. The same
eyelet detail on collars pepped up shortie coats with their flared
skirts.
   The fabrics were soft but warm for winter, the color
combinations autumnal and artistic. Besides navy and black, there
were touches of dusty rose or blue, ochre, khaki and aubergine or
burgundy, often worked together in appealing combinations.
   One of the real originals in the collection was a brown
velveteen dress shirred around the scoop neckline and at the waist,
worn with a silky high-necked green shirt underneath.
   For dressier moments, Jun also used chiffon to fashion fly-away
minis over matching tights, beautiful in deep blue and ochre. Other
ideas included his strict black tuxedo with narrow chino pants, the
jacket lapels made of a ribbon effect over a polka-dotted blouse.
   Whether working with taffeta or elasticized wool jersey, Jun
seemed right at home with his fabrics, showing exquisite tailoring
and cut.
   ``Jun, July, Auguste'' has Japanese backing by the Five Fox
retail group, and they hope to do well in France before starting
marketing in the United States.
   The clothes will be manufactured for the French market by
Chofflet-Style in Moulins in central France, who also make clothes
for well-known names like Paco Rabanne, Azzedine Alaia and Popy
Moreni.
   Priced around $475 to $700 for a long jacket or coat, the
clothes may sound expensive. But by high-quality luxury
ready-to-wear standards these days, they're almost a steal for
anybody who wants original touches in a fashionable wardrobe.

<LEADPARA>  THE San Jose Museum of Art Auxiliary's recent debut fashion show luncheon will
be a hard act to follow.;   Focusing on the designs of Diane Freis and using
community members, including San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer, as models, it proved
to be a cohesive presentation. The show was an eye-opener for those who think
of Freis strictly in the vein of the confetti-print, ruffled,
one-size-fits-all dresses that first established her as a popular designer.
There were sexy black velvet dinner suits with a smattering of embroidery on
the jackets; slinky jumpsuits with chiffon over-skirts; solid-color quilted
skirts and pants teamed with print jackets; a heavy dose of metallic prints,
and some beautiful beaded and sequined jackets. The clothes came from the San
Francisco boutique of the California-born, Hong Kong-based designer, who
couldn't attend.  </LEADPARA>

   Geoffrey Beene believes the jumpsuit could
become the unisex look of the future. But his svelte, black version
for spring harkens feminine magic.
   Rising star Angel Estrada has mixed up some magic of his own in
elegantly draped silk dresses.
   Beene describes his slinky, black, crepe jumpsuit, with a halter
front and a swimsuit back, as ``the new ballgown.'' He tops it with
a sharp, cropped jacket in coral, yellow or white.
   Another enchanting, black jumpsuit is studded with pink moons
and stars. The heavenly motif appears again at the waist and
neckline of a long, slightly clingy, black gown.
   Throughout his collection, necklines are slashed into striking
geometric shapes, including stars. ``Fashion is both magic and
magical,'' observes Beene. ``It's a Snow White kind of magic.''
   The designer also favored polka dots, especially in baby-doll
dressing dominated by short, sweet circle skirts and petticoats.
   One version, with an empire waistline, was strapless and sugary
in white-and-black dots with curvy piping around the hemline. A
strapless, black, bustier dress was zippered in front and back,
with a black, full, baby-doll skirt in black-and-white dots. Many
skirts landed about four inches above the knees.
   Beautiful, billowy coats were another of Beene's crowning
glories. A black, street-length, Phantom of the Opera coat swirled
like a cape. White, scalloped lace circled its stand-up collar.
   Swishy, suave, calf-length raincoats were fashioned in green or
gray. A short, effervescent, Ultrasuede coat in fuchsia or coral
sprouted an uneven hemline. A yellow cotton sheath with a square
neck and zip front is splashed with black jonquils; the matching
coat had a capelike back.
   Estrada's silk designs, in crepes, taffeta and chiffon, are
based on the trim, timeless, princess silhouette. His draping
provides la difference.
   A mint green mini-dress has a foamy cowl that floats down over
the shoulders. A gold micro-mini, not for the faint-hearted,
resembles a swimsuit, with draping over the bustline and a bustle
effect in the back. A short, red, bustier dress looks almost like a
jumper over a see-through blouse with balloon sleeves.
   When the Renaissance mood strikes, m'lady would be fetching in a
pink, strapless, ankle-length gown, slightly flared at the bottom,
with spaghetti straps and plunging back. The long-sleeved
bolero-style jacket rises to the midriff. The ensemble is completed
with a medieval hat topped with two tall, pink horns and yards of
veil.

<HEAD>Couture for Winter with Exoticism, Artistry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shorter skirts than ever and plenty of lush fabrics
appear to be the main themes for next winter's lines of haute
couture.
   Christian Lacroix opened a week of fashion shows Sunday with a
stunning display of exotica and opulent fabrics, refining his line
with some superb jackets and trapeze coats, fur-trimmed velvet and
gilded brocade.
   A gold-shot raspberry tweed suit with bold rhinestone buttons
seemed to please Ivana Trump, who is staying at the famed Ritz
hotel. She beamed througout Lacroix's show.
   Like the other main houses, Lacroix is ready to lengthen the
short styles on the runway for a rich client who decides $10,000 is
too much for a bathing-suit length cocktail dress.
   The cheery designer from southern France looked somewhat pale as
he took a bow to enthusiastic applause. But after two back
operations several months ago, and a lawsuit brought by his former
employer Patou, he says he's still in fine shape.
   The Lacroix exuberance occasionally flounces out in too many
details, such as layer on layer of lace, or yet another bustle, but
most of his fitted clothes were splendid.
   So were the adornments _ sparkly buttons, sable cuffs, detailed
embroidery and heavy-metal jeweling straight from Byzantium. Even
boots were jeweled, giving the slightly 1960s silhouettes new
lavishness.
   ``I get my inspiration from all over,'' said Lacroix.
   Another dream world for rich fashion devotees was turned out by
Hanae Mori. The Japanese couturiere, who won the Legion of Honor
last year, also is the only Japanese officially accepted as a
member of the French haute couture group, the Chambre Syndicale.
   Mori was awarded a delicate white rose in her name at the Parc
de Bagatelle a few weeks ago. The French have honored many famous
women, including Barbara Bush, by naming a rose after them.
   At her show, Mori concentrated on exquisite drapes and flowers
as a theme for her dressier clothes. Her rose-fastened satin gowns
with draping and sparkling embroidery were luscious for debutantes
or women a bit older.
   Mori did some wonderful short suits in smooth wools,
easily-fitted with flaring long peplum jackets, and luxuriant short
cashmere or smooth-wool capes in colors raspberry or mustard.
   But her show-stoppers were the slithery sequined gowns
embroidered to look like Van Gogh paintings, with all the swirls
and cypresses right out of the Arles masterpieces.
   Meanwhile, Italian Gianni Versace threw a splashy party in the
Ritz gardens Saturday night following his show. The guest of honor
was Sylvester Stallone.
   The big idea was an array of print mixes and sparkly embroidery
_ in the shortest outfits possible.
   His dots, checks and 1960s-style graphics for the sheer fun of
it drew kudos. And he showed some new pleated and draped looks he
says were inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's paintings.
   Among the sprouting new talent, Dutch-born Paul B. Elsen, 27,
gave a promising offering of truly couture-finished styles. He
reportedly sewed all 32 garments himself.
   His long fitted redingote-style jackets with their jaunty
riders' top hats were well made, as were some of the terrific pants
suits, often with an interesting bolero flared with sharp pleats at
the back.
   To amuse the jaded fashion crowd and launch a new watch
collection called ``Mademoiselle,'' the Chanel company is opening
up the Chanel suite at the Ritz for the week. The rooms are
reconstituted exactly as when Coco Chanel lived there before World
War II.

<TEXT>     Bill Blass;  Blass is mad for plaid -- particularly tartans and houndstooth
-- as well as stripes for day and luxury fabrics such as panne velvet, lace,
satin and beading for evening.;    Very distinctive are Blass' double-wrap
skirts, two oblong pieces of fabric -- one wrapped to the left, another to the
right, overlapping in front and back. The result is an uneven hemline that's
interesting and looks to be less revealing than the traditional wrap skirt.;  
 Much of the Blass collection is clearly meant for special-occasion and
evening wear. Particularly sexy, and sure to be copied widely, are the formal
velvet smoking jackets casually tied with sashes, bathrobe-style.;    One
accessory worth noting from Blass is the watch cap -- it showed up on many of
the day dresses and suits and even for evening with the addition of a
rhinestone pin.;    Arnold Scaasi;  Starting off with Scottish-style tartan
dresses and a stirring bagpipe march, Scaasi's obviously hearing a different
drummer than the rest of the designers showing collections thus far. While
others are sticking with shorter hemlines, Scaasi has dropped his to and below
the knee.;    Scaasi's favorite silhouette in this predominantly evening
collection is a shoulder-baring, waist skimming, full skirt. Frankly, it's
hard to imagine Barbara Bush exposing her shoulders in one of these dresses,
but on many women it could be a flattering look. And since Scaasi is her
favorite designer, he no doubt will come up with something special for her as
well.;    Fabrics are worth noting for both their luxury factor and color.
Scaasi is liberal with velvet, chiffon and lavish with lace, appliques and
embroidery. His prints include lots of roses, hearts and dots. Colors are
often eye-popping fuchsia, lime, purple, turquoise, orange and, of course,
that shade that is becoming known as "Barbara Blue.";    Carolina Herrera;   
For her 10th-anniversary collection, Herrera sticks with designs that have
brought her success -- smart luncheon outfits, sexy cocktail dresses and
attractive gowns.;    The day dresses, suits and trouser ensembles are mainly
in wool, classic in cut and pretty in unusual shades of pink with a
greenish-brown, gray and cocoa, camel and chocolate and teal and pink. Much
brighter is Herrera's use of her favorite combination of taxi cab yellow and
black -- in houndstooth-check dresses with black velvet cuffs and, for
dressier affairs, houndstooth jackets shot through with metallic threads and
teamed with slinky floor-length, black sequin skirts.;    Like Scaasi and
Blass, Herrera is having a fling with lace, but makes it look fresh by
layering gold lace over navy-and-white lace over black. A feminine look is
found in her ball gowns with velvet bodices and layered organza skirts.;   
Charlotte Neuville;  The former San Franciscan who has made her fashion mark
in New York takes her fall design cues from the streets and the '60s.;   
Ribbed turtlenecks -- reminiscent of '60s "poor boy" tops -- are a key
element, along with leggings paired with short, flippy dresses.;   
Throughout, Neuville accessorizes clothes with what she calls "Homeboy
Pendants" -- large, sequined hearts, stars, crowns and peace symbols worn on
large, long chains. They look to be a good deal lighter than the automobile
hood ornament necklaces that they resemble.;    The evening look to remember
from Neuville is a very simple, short-sleeved, black T-shirt dress made from a
textured, sparkling fabric she calls "Astroturf."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Judge Orders Child Molester to Publicize His Misdeeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who said she wanted to keep a
child molester from ``slinking back into the dark'' has ordered the
man to buy a newspaper ad with his picture, an apology and a plea
for others to get help.
   Superior Court Judge Corinne P. Grande gave Stephen
Germershausen, 29, until Friday to buy the 4- by 6-inch ad in The
Providence Journal-Bulletin. The judge on Oct. 26 also placed
Germershausen on 35 years' probation.
   He pleaded guilty to fondling three children, ages 8 to 11, and
sexually assaulting one of them two years ago.
   ``I thought, if he goes to jail, that's good because he'll be
locked up; and while he's locked up, he's not going to hurt anybody
anymore,'' Grande said.
   ``But then I thought, once he got out, he'd go slinking back into
the dark, and no one ever would know what he had done.''
   Grande said ``there doesn't appear to be a sufficient social
response to people like Stephen Germershausen. So I thought about
other children and wondered whether I could use the sentencing
process to effect some change.''
   ``I think that this type of punishment by humiliation is not an
appropriate form of punishment,'' said Stephen Brown, executive
director of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Defense attorney Robert B. Mann said that Germershausen had
undergone intensive therapy and that a report suggested he was ``no
longer a threat.''
   Gerhershausen's picture must carry a caption that identifies him
as a child molester and also reads:
   ``If you are a child molester, get professional help immediately
or you may find your picture and name in the paper and your life
under control of the state. This ad is being published by order of
the Superior Court judge who sentenced me.''
   Grande also ordered Germershausen to contribute $1,000 to a
program to help child victims of sexual abuse.
   In Portland, Ore., a judge in 1987 ordered a child molester to
hang a sign on his door warning children to stay away. Judges in
Florida have ordered people convicted of drunken driving to use
bumper stickers announcing their misdeeds.

When Italy's Gianfranco Ferre showed his first collection for the French house 
of Christian Dior last summer, critics accused him of trying too hard and 
straying toward prissiness. 
</P>
<P>
But his Monday show of spring and summer designs, his first ready-to-wear 
collection for Dior, was more relaxed. There were plenty of flexible separates 
-- smart city pants, shorts, skirts, flouncy chiffon chemises and tight jackets 
in black, white, gray, periwinkle blue, red, violet and vibrant yellow. 
</P>
<P>
His signature -- the bow blouse -- was outsized in organza or taffeta. Some 
were worn off the shoulder, others had black lace cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian designer took traditional Dior trademarks -- ballroom skirts, 
little black dresses, lilies-of-the-valley -- and gave them a contemporary 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Flower-brocaded evening skirts were sheer enough to allow legs to show through. 
Little black dresses were cut from slinky leather, and red taffeta ball gowns 
were cut away in front to reveal narrow black-satin slacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a marriage of Dior and Ferre," the sweat-drenched designer said after 
the show. "I've tried to take the great Dior name and adapt it to contemporary 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"A lovely collection," said designer Paloma Picasso, praising the taffeta 
dresses and stream-lined city slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Notable by her absence from the audience was Princess Caroline of Monaco, a 
devotee of Dior's previous designer, Marc Bohan. Since Bohan was abruptly 
dismissed and replaced by Ferre last spring, the princess has boycotted Dior 
shows. But this time her place was taken by another royal -- Britain's Princess 
Michael of Kent. 
</P>
<P>
At Chanel, West German-born designer Karl Lagerfeld presented one of his best 
collections. He led off with transparent chiffon skirts worn under ivory tweed 
jackets. Transparency is a theme in most Paris collections for spring. 
Lagerfeld treated it as one of the several important ingredients for modern 
dress. Others are shorts for all occasions, and bosom wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld played with the jacket form, cutting it into a short bolero, or 
leaving it so long and fitted that it all but covered the flirty miniskirts or 
shorts worn underneath. 
</P>
<P>
He curved the decorative trimming indelibly associated with Chanel into 
geometric designs to outline pockets, hems and necklines. 
</P>
<P>
It was a leggy collection, given an airy feel by the floating chiffon Lagerfeld 
used for his asymmetric skirts and fluttering shorts. Black chiffon dresses 
were scooped and draped at the sides to show the thighs, and the same fabric 
returned in hot pants for evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-born designer Hanae Mori, who was presented with the Legion of Honor 
during this press week, celebrated her 35th year in the industry with a 
particularly young-looking collection. 
</P>
<P>
Short skirts, wide shorts and long flared skirts in striped chiffon made up her 
daytime sportswear. She put her signature -- the butterfly -- on navy linen 
suits and on her iridescent evening wear.

<F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor N. Polezhayeva to </F>
Moscow Prosecutor G.S. Ponomarev: "Witness' Testimony"] 
  [Text] I, Natalya Ivanovna Polezhayeva, chief editor of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, have received a summons from the Moscow 
prosecutor's office demanding that I appear before investigator 
Leontyeva for questioning as a witness. I know very well I have 
not witnessed any crime and so I naturally asked Mikhail 
Ivanovich Slinko, chief of the department for the investigation 
of banditry, in what connection and on what basis I was being 
summoned. 
  It turned out it was in connection with the 12 April 
publication in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of the article "Between the 
Criminals and the Bureaucrats.... Who Needed Otari 
Kvantrishvili's Death?" They wanted to find out from me the 
name of the author and the source of the information. 
  I do not think that interrogation is needed for these 
questions. An official request was enough, which had been 
suggested. But M.I. Slinko, citing some article in the Criminal 
Code, promised to draw up a compulsory court attendance order. 
  In order not to waste my own working time nor that of the 
prosecutor's office workers, I have taken the liberty of 
printing my testimony in the newspaper. 
  In accordance with article 41 of the Russian Federation law 
"On the Mass Media," "the editorial office is obliged to keep 
secret its source of information and does not have the right to 
name a person supplying information on condition he is not 
named, except for a case when relevant demand has come from a 
court in connection with a case with which it is dealing." 
  In this case the author made anonymity a condition for the 
purposes of his own safety. In this connection I cannot give 
the author's name or the source of the information. But I 
assure you it was obtained from officials of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the editorial office has no doubts about it. 
  [signed] Witness N. Polezhayeva

   Sheer elegance at Chanel for next winter won
designer Karl Lagerfeld a roar of applause in his Monday
ready-to-wear show.
   The great choices in short or long skirts and pants were welcome
for Chanel fans, sometimes disappointed with Lagerfeld's recent
creative eccentricities.
   His sportier looks were based on glen plaid or tweed blazers
with lean skirts or pants, often topped with short fencers' capes.
   With feathered hats, it was vaguely Tyrolian, although there
were lots of familiar Chanel chain belts and buttons used
discreetly throughout. Gold buttons were de rigueur down the arms
and jackets of most suits.
   As a change from the familiar and much-copied chain and quilt
Chanel shoulder bag, there's a new model in bright red and green
plaids.
   One of the best jackets here was narrowed at the waist, had
curved lounging-jacket lapels, patch pockets with a pleat and came
in bright red, green or navy. It topped a swingy, pleated gray
skirt or pants.
   The trouser suits for day were in muted browns, grays or greens,
cutest with a nipped plaid bolero. Also in the Tyrolean vein were
the long or short gathered bold plaid skirts, dressiest when topped
with a clinging black sweater with lace yoke.
   There were blouses galore for all the easy pants, most often in
white Georgette silk crepe with pierrot, double-pleated ruffles and
wide flounced necklines.
   The longer suits _ often in navy or black _ were strictly lean,
but moved well. And in black velvet they had lovely touches of
double knit rows of ruffles or embroidered flowers, big and small.
   The fluid evening satin pyjamas with belted tunic tops in
searing colors could be sure-fire classic winners.
   Knits were super too, remarkable in ivory cable-knit cardigans
over gorgeous draped chiffon dinner dresses. In spite of some
peppy, full, bright skirts with lace, ribbons, crinolines and busy
tops, the overall statement was totally wearable chic.
   Kenzo's show was a cheery ode to fall. He too showed all lengths
with some Medieval-Renaissance touches. His best red suit with a
skirt just above the knee had an interesting sleeve puffed out
below the dropped shoulder.
   Kenzo's pants suits were lean and pin-striped for dandies, black
``smokings'' a la George Sand or had a Medieval look with page-boy
knickers, often with capes in rust or olive colors and sometimes
with big silk scarves with Renaissance portraits.
   Other graceful touches were in the colorful tweed and flowered
velvet fitted suits, again skirts mini to long. There was a lovely
``skyline'' inspired group of light challis wool and chiffon
dresses printed with puffy clouds.
   Maryll Lanvin's versatile approach featured well-cut clothes in
good fabrics. They looked young, but could be worn by any age.
   Lots of pants worked fine, especially topped by fitted, checked
cropped jackets or tiny boleros in autumn colors.
   Also remarkable were her short suits with very long jackets in
windowpane-checked bright yellow or royal blue. Other suits came
out in more subtle gray, tan or brick shades with full peplums on
the jackets.
   The best coat in hot tones of orange, fuschia and emerald turned
up in an egg shape and was worn with a neat piped suit underneath _
in a different sizzling shade.
   Cocktail looks turned elaborate, with drapes and puffs and
dazzling colors. They exuded a faint air of Ungaro, but were less
showy than his exaggerations.
   A safe but appealing party choice would be the romantic white
ruffled Victorian blouses over black draped silk sheaths.
   Paisley turned up here as all over the Paris shows, in soft,
full-skirted day dresses or as big borders on flounced black
numbers, or dresses with pointed handkerchief-panel skirts. And the
velvet paisley lounging pyjama suit was best of all.
   Sonia Rykiel, often best at her own familiar tunes, classic
knits, branched out at her winter show into quilted tops and suits
that were so puffy they made the wearer look like the Michelin man.
   But she had some excellent suits. An amethyst or flame short
knit suit with the jacket bowed in back had the Rykiel chic. And
her fitted caviar or houndstooth spencer suits were timely and
handsome, as were the graceful dark or tan solid-color suits,
nearly ankle-length.
   Evenings at Rykiel are best in the slinky, long black outfits
with sparkly details. Striped taffetas with big V-shaped panels in
front and full skirts in silvery grays lacked Rykiel's light touch
and ended up on the too-prim side of heavy Victorian.

The classics of Hermes touched knees Tuesday with the more decorative designs 
of Valentino and Emanuel Ungaro as all three fashion houses showed their fall 
styles within a 24-hour span. 
</P>
<P>
Hermes, undergoing great expansion in Europe these days, is trying to update 
its fashion image without losing its traditional charm. The results are a 
quaint blend of prim and progressive. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's famous silk twill scarf prints have been incorporated into shirts, 
sweaters and vests, which will probably become collector's items. They are 
teamed with slim leather pants, knickers and timeless tweed suits with an old 
money look. Colors for these are in the classic category, too: deep red, dark 
green, warm brown and camel. 
</P>
<P>
Some pants and coats have Kelly fastenings (named for the late 
actress-turned-princess, Grace Kelly), which have been used for decades in the 
company's luggage and bags. Updated looks include swingy fleece jackets that 
reverse from green to pale pumpkin, slate blue to gray and wine to taupe. A 
pants outfit is executed in three fabrics of the same pale sky blue shade: 
corduroy pants, slubbed wool jacket and leather coat. 
</P>
<P>
Skirts were just below the knee or longer for day and evening wear, which 
included gracefully slim black coat dresses and loose, black or white satin 
jackets to toss over skinny black satin pants. 
</P>
<P>
The new design team here consists of Claude Brouet, a French former fashion 
magazine editor; and designers Myrene de Premonville, Tan Giudicelli and Thomas 
Maier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright and Busy 
</P>
<P>
Ungaro's look is bright and busy by comparison. It is a melange of mixed 
patterns, shiny bright satins and velvets, iridescent taffeta and tri-color 
outfits with bright shades used for jackets, blouses and skirts. In among these 
mixed messages were elegantly simple, wool tweed and black leather suits. A big 
group of the designer's signature dresses in bright colors, draped and shirred 
from shoulder to knee, received enthusiastic applause Tuesday. They looked 
positively simple amid all the other Ungaro clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The frill was definitely not gone from this designer's drawing board. His final 
group of evening wear featured short, iridescent taffeta, igloo-shaped capes 
above short, slim strapless dresses bedecked with huge rows of ruffles 
traveling every which way. 
</P>
<P>
Italian designer Valentino seemed to leave no trend untapped in his 200-outfit 
show Monday, the longest of the season so far. Long, quilted circle skirts with 
button fronts, slim skirts in above-the-knee and ankle lengths, cuffed 
trousers, tufted or quilted jackets, plaid suits and short, sexy, draped 
dresses were all on the menu here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrasts in Color 
</P>
<P>
Colors were very bright or subdued. Hot pink or bright blue silk-quilted 
jackets appeared above slinky brown sequined dresses. Black cashmere jumpsuits 
featured filmy lace bodice inserts and lace turtlenecks. Black velvet dresses 
and theater suits were ornamented with frilly white ruffled collars and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The designer's signature fabric this season is a mosaic of tiny geometric 
shapes, which look sewn together by hand, as if for a quilt. This fabric, in 
brights or shades of brown, showed up in skirts, jackets and coats throughout 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The French culture minister invited visiting buyers and press on Monday night 
to the Gauguin art exhibit, which recently toured the United States and is on 
display here. On Sunday night, designer Yves Saint Laurent hosted a museum tour 
of Russian costumes lent by the Hermitage. Saint Laurent ends the week of fall 
fashion shows with his presentation today.

<TEXT>
   Emanuel Ungaro's luxury ready-to-wear show Tuesday
did more for the rich peasant look from the East than anybody since
Yves Saint Laurent brought out folklore from the steppes in 1976.
   And Ungaro made it sexy in a Parisian way that only master
tailor and colorist could pull off. It was his best ready-to-wear
show in many seasons.
   Everything was there in an up-to-date melding of East and West.
Ungaro took flower-printed long velvet skirts and topped them with
shimmery lame blouses or flowered vests and rich, quilted velvet
short jackets and Russian army hats or pillboxes with tassels.
   Color ran riot in this show that had plenty of sophisticated
smooth-wool daytime suits with bicolor waist-fitted tops, in
eye-catching shades like violet, carmine or peacock with charcoal,
emphasizing feminine curves.
   But the sexy message was there, this time in good taste. A
voluptuous model looked fancy but fetching in a decollete silk
jersey blouse and wrapped flowered satin long high-waisted skirt
ornamented by a bright pink taffeta bow and jeweled pin.
   The skirt was split to show plenty of leg. The whole thing was
topped by a royal blue taffeta-lined multicolored velvet jacket.
   Ungaro used loads of metallic soft leathers in brief minis,
sleek long pants, quilted anoraks. But he also mixed these up with
colorful printed silk velvets, satin tunics, throwing in
beautifully cut checked suits and straight pants.
   His lame-shot silk print chiffon blouses will be coveted by
anybody with a yearning to shimmer and shine, at any time of day. A
new fashion message beaming from Paris: it's OK to look fairly
glitzy even for lunch, as long as you do it tastefully.
   Part of Ungaro's new exuberance was high, knee-covering boots
worn with the minis, the most sensational in flowered prints and
brocades.
   The glory of this collection was that one can choose. Pile on
the opulence to flaunt it, or pare things down to the Ungaro
details _ all excellent.
   Even the ``little black dress,'' a strapless short sheath, was
perfectly dressed up by strands of pearls and cabochon stones,
topped by an airy black organza shrug.
   At Guy Laroche, the boutique-line designer Guy Douvier got all
the trends right in an upbeat collection full of the current colors
and silhouettes.
   While Ungaro's ``Parallele'' line is expensive, a suit upward of
$2,000 or more, the somewhat simpler but still fashionable Laroche
offerings are well-made, and cost about half as much.
   He went in for flaring shortie coats, the mohair versions
looking great with important patch pockets in primary colors or
more subtle shades of vanilla, coral or violet.
   In the sporty lines, Douvier showed good long cable-knit
collegiate pullovers or silver-buttoned cardigans over tiny tweed
minis. There were also great tricolor knit dresses topped by
black-edged shawls.
   Laroche offered the currently trendy bright quilted duffels. For
evening, the gold versions opened up to reveal sexy split-skirt
outfits or a wonderful brown and lame pleated lace cocktail dress.
   One classic but novel trouser outfit here teamed an apple-green
bolero and jersey pullover with narrow khaki suede pants and a
fringed violet and yellow shawl printed with a wild-animal pattern.
   Both Ungaro and Laroche showed versions of puffy iridescent
bubble short evening dresses but they somehow looked a bit passe
compared with the slinkier gowns split up the leg.
   Laroche brought out some nice short minks and fur-lined suede
duffel coats.
   Frederic Castet, for 20 years the fur designer at Dior,
displayed his fur-lined fashions in his runway debut. He will open
a shop on the rue Bassano, in the fashion area known as the
``golden triangle'' near the Champs-Elysees, celebrating the event
with golden triangle adornments on belts and sunflower motifs
appliqued on silk blouses.
   Besides the most sumptuous duffels, parkas and swirly pyramid
minks in natural or dyed ruby or indigo shades, chinchilla, fox and
fisher, Castet also brought out a beautiful new fake fur in woven
silk called ``Castiss.''
   It's a dead-ringer for sheared mink or beaver, and looks fine as
duffels, parkas, or taffeta raincoat linings.
   Valentino brought out his usual impeccably cut outfits, often
featuring a new look in tiny ``Fortuny'' or crystal pleating all
over dresses in flounces or palazzo pants.
   He piled on satin, lace and gold-leaf appliques for an opulent
effect.

DESIGNERS DELIVER GOOD NEWS FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, Times Staff Writer

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of his show here Thursday, designer Giorgio di Sant'Angelo knelt 
down on the fashion runway, leaned into the crowd and kissed the editor of 
Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, on the cheek. She smiled and blushed. 
</P>
<P>
That suggested something about why designers stage fashion shows. They want to 
get out the news of their latest collections, and they hope the news will be 
good. 
</P>
<P>
This season many will get their wish. Reactions have been positive to clothes 
that look fresh, but at the same time familiar. Active wear shapes -- 
especially parkas, down-filled vests, ponchos and stretch pants -- are all 
being recast in luxury fabrics for ready-to-wear dressing. They give fall 
fashion an air of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Navajo Blanket Print Coats 
</P>
<P>
There are other themes to watch for too. Men's bathrobes inspire the Burgundy 
velvet and gold silk Jacquard coats Donna Karan is showing for evening, and the 
Navajo blanket print version Ralph Lauren offers for day. 
</P>
<P>
Color is replacing black. Not harsh, hyper-bright shades, but warm, flattering 
tones of blue, green and deeper red. A number of designers are using these 
shades for the narrow-cut suits they prefer as office wear. Calvin Klein, 
however, substitutes taupe or deep sand for black. 
</P>
<P>
White shirts are still a staple, especially for Karan and Ronaldus Shamask. 
Often they are shown tucked into narrow-leg pants. Pants have stirrups at 
Lauren, Karan and Roehm. They are cropped at the ankle at Klein and Shamask, 
for the cutting-edge silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short, Narrow Skirts Return 
</P>
<P>
Skirts are making a return to style, after two seasons when they were 
overshadowed by pants. Short, narrow skirts look best now. (For day, Oscar de 
la Renta and Geoffrey Beene show them above the knee, Bill Blass and Calvin 
Klein show them to the knee.) 
</P>
<P>
Ankle-length is second choice. (Shamask prefers it for day and night. Louis 
Dell 'Olio for Anne Klein shows it as often as knee-length. Isaac Mizrahi 
offers some skirts to the ankle, but more are cut above the knee.) Only 
mid-calf lengths look out-of-sync for fall. (Karan shows many at that length, 
so does Roehm.) 
</P>
<P>
The other interesting development in fashion now has to do with casual dress. 
Younger-spirited designers in particular are giving over as much as a third of 
their collection to clothes for traveling, touring, lounging, and working as a 
self-employed business person unrestricted by a corporate dress code. 
</P>
<P>
Roehm shows stretch pants, tunics, ponchos and parkas as the essence of her 
casual collection. Karan teams oversize cashmere sweaters with stretch pants, 
and often adds a Sherpa jacket or coat for her high quality, super-casual look. 
</P>
<P>
Klein shows tight, suede jeans and cable knit cashmere sweaters tied one over 
the other for expensive-looking casual wear. Marc Jacobs of Perry Ellis offers 
witty, flag-motif stoles, and suede pants tucked into thigh-high boots. 
Standouts in Mizrahi's casual collection are his strapless, tartan plaid kilt 
dresses, and his black, broadtail knapsack jacket to wear with a silk taffeta 
shirtwaist dress. He filled the deep patch pockets of the jacket with wild 
flowers for his show. 
</P>
<P>
But evening parkas are by far the most surprising fall addition, and Isaac 
Mizrahi shows them to their best advantage. The 27-year-old designer started 
the trend with his first collection, about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silk Parka 
</P>
<P>
His newest designs include a satiny, sable-colored style he tosses over short, 
strapless, body-skimming dresses in the same color. And his formal wear 
includes a floor-length silk parka, worn with a white silk shirt and dazzling 
black, sequinned pants. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Klein shows a quilted velvet parka with narrow velvet pants for night. 
Michael Kors styles parkas, as well as gray flannel sweat-shirt dresses with 
drawstring hoods, for day. 
</P>
<P>
Karan upgrades the down-filled vest for fall. Hers is Bordeaux velvet, worn 
with navy, crepe, stretch pants and an ivory silk blouse. 
</P>
<P>
It works, where some others do not. Jacobs of Perry Ellis mixes bright, satin 
down vests with strictly daytime shirts and pants. The playful yet dressy outer 
wear loses something in the translation. 
</P>
<P>
Having mastered her unique approach to day wear, Karan's evening wear is her 
more inventive group for fall. She shows slinky, elasticized-crepe dresses that 
mold to the body in a sensual way. Her bathrobe coats and smoking suits look 
rich and modern. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Kamali is also showing bathrobe coats, in embroidered velvet, 
flamboyantly oversized and reminiscent of the late Victorian era. But they 
don't quite work; they look too much like costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Kamali's strength lies in her belted, black jumpsuits with white collar and 
cuffs. They fit like unitards and look right for youthful, swift, supple 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Di Sant'Angelo, known for his small evening collections, drapes and knots 
fabric around the body in characteristic form for fall. His smartest daytime 
coat dress is made of a fabric he calls bonded foam that has the look and feel 
of surfers' Neoprene wetsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Super-slim model Cheryl Tiegs sat in the front row at the Di Sant'Angelo show, 
and her sort of long, lean figure is best suited to his body-contoured 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blanket Dressing' 
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, audiences started talking about the "blanket dressing" seen 
on many designer runways this season. The term refers to the variety of big 
wraps worn layered over each other, or knotted over suit jackets, for day as 
well as night. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Dell 'Olio for Anne Klein put his huge shawls over tunic sweaters and 
sarong-like skirts in red or black wool, for day. Bill Blass shows enormous 
evening wraps in chiffon, over long, fluid dresses. Some have a single sleeve, 
which apparently makes them difficult to wear. Even his runway models struggled 
to keep them from twisting and tangling. 
</P>
<P>
The blanket idea makes sense for Los Angeles, where temperatures seldom require 
a heavier wrap, and driving makes it difficult to wear snug-fitting coats or 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Other good ideas for Southern California are the light-weight, very full shell 
coats that almost every designer includes in his or her fall collection. 
Geoffrey Beene makes the most beautiful version. His is ankle-length, tangerine 
mohair lined with black-and-tangerine gingham check taffeta. He shows it over 
black pants and a burnt orange fencing-style jacket. 
</P>
<P>
If Mizrahi is New York fashion's new young Turk, Beene is the uncontested 
master. Other daytime looks in his fall collection are built on black 
jumpsuits. He adds bolero jackets or brief, almost off-the-shoulder jackets he 
calls shrugs. Some have hoods. His daytime suits have matching shawls wrapped 
several times around the shoulders for a nose-tickling look. 
</P>
<P>
His taffeta evening skirts have hems of lingerie lace that show only in front, 
where the skirt rises slightly. And gold, lingerie lace floats to the floor, in 
an outfit with a matching hooded cape. 
</P>
<P>
Among his imaginative accessories are a glen plaid taffeta stole for day, 
black-net and lace gloves, and a confetti-dotted net stole for night. 
</P>
<P>
But the newest invention from this ingenious designer's studio is his shrug. He 
made the first one in black lace, for Glenn Close' Oscar outfit this year. 
Close was in the front row when Beene showed his remarkable fall collection.

<TEXT>
   Extravagant was the name of the game Monday as
couturiers took a trip to dreamland in their winter shows.
   With the bicentennial of the French Revolution, designers seem
intent on bringing back clothes fit for a queen.
   The biggest news was at Dior, as the Italian couturier
Gianfranco Ferre nearly brought down the tent in an outdoor show at
the gardens of the Salomon-Rothschild Foundation. Ferre, named in
May to replace Marc Bohan, was chosen to add excitement to the
world's most prestigious label.
   Ferre obviously made the grade, with his opulent collection of
fitted clothes that led off with a waist-cinching fitted black
crepe redingote topped with a stovepipe hat. He finally wound up in
a Dioresque whirl of strapless ball gowns with tulle petticoats,
wrapped sable stoles and jackets, plus huge organza bows, and
bouquets of lily of the valley _ a favorite at Dior.
   Ferre managed to combine all the sumptuous fabrics and furs in
rigorously constructed clothes that looked both retrospective and
beautifully modern. He did a marvelous job of making red or pearl
gray persian lamb look like embroidered lace on a sexy strapless
sheath evening gown. He made fitted suits of creamy-beige ostrich
leather look soft and feminine.
   Ferre showed skirt lengths flatteringly around midknee for
daytime _ or opted for dressy trousers above the ankle.
   Arms were slim under shoulders with a whisper of padding for
shape. Whether caped ball gowns, satin trousers or tweed suits in
bold herringbones with sparkly sequins, the Dior line looked fit to
win.
   Hem lengths were irrelevant in most of the dazzling parades of
lucre.
   ``It's a trip abroad, a dream,'' said Jean-Louis Scherrer who
decked out his daughter and favorite model Laetitia like a
glamorous toy soldier, complete with gold tasseled epaulets and
braid-edged cap.
   Scherrer also was on the road to India, which he trod a few
years ago. This time, it was richer than ever, with lame-shot sari
silks and chiffons, galloon-edged boleros, rich shades of panne
velvet and Persian embroideries worn with silk and gold lame
turbans.
   ``You could wear this with jeans,'' said Scherrer, gesturing to
a richly braided military jacket with gold frog buttons.
   Chocolate is hot for next winter, and Scherrer went all out for
the browns, jazzing them up with shades of red from flame and coral
to cyclamen, plus some peacock and royal blue.
   Balmain's designer Erik Mortensen also used prodigious amounts
of expensive fabrics in a successful extravaganza. The man who
practically reinvented shorts for couture went in for a
pedal-pusher pants, making them extraordinarily beautiful with
their toppers of bright teal blue, pistachio or flame-flared
jackets with bold buttons and funnel collars.
   Mortensen pulled off a clever trick by covering bodies with full
tent-like shapes, then baring legs clad in tights with gold Persian
embroidery up the sides. Among the memorable coats were the
gray-black-white pyramids in mohair and Mongolian goat, and the
red-and-green lacy models tufted with marabout or ostrich _ fun but
not very warm.
   The gold, copper and lame stiffened silk dresses stiffened like
thin sheets of metal were draped perfectly, slit up the leg for
walking. But they also dragged fishtail-trains, better for standing
around than circulating at a cocktail party.
   But even with piling on fabrics, stiff ruffles and sparkling
details, Mortensen made it all look floaty and light.
   Pierre Cardin got an enthusiastic hand for his winter
collection, which sparkled with enough titillating geometric
details to evoke his old magic.
   He obviously was tired of short skirts, showing very few. He
preferred a midcalf narrow skirt, or else simply no skirt at all
just a long jacket over tights, or slightly flared pants.
   Shoulders were natural or eclipsed by important collars, always
a strong point with Cardin, who knows how to play with shapes like
a kid with cutouts.
   The coats often had kimono or handkerchief sleeves, and some had
tiered skirts under a narrow bust.
   The favorite waistline was dropped to the hip, emphasized by a
narrow leather belt, the coat gathered like a ruffle beneath it.
   The fun popped up in high-collared short coats edged at the
armhole in fake fur or Mongolian lamb, in leather-banded sleeveless
sweater-coats, or in caped poncho looks.
   Evening wear by Andre Oliver was just as rich. Using stiffened
hoops and pleats _ the basic Cardin shapes _ Oliver sculpted some
dashing ladies of the night in Chantilly lace, fuschia and
pistachio taffeta, diaphanous chiffon.
   And they were topped by funny hats _ the favorite ones a pillbox
big as a hatbox, wrapped in satin ribbon, and a mortarboard tied
with a scarf.

INTO THE NIGHT: CELEBRITY AND CELESTIAL STARGAZING MAKE 'TOTAL RECALL' BASH 
MEMORABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Scene: Mega-bash Thursday night for "Total Recall," a Tri-Star release that 
promises to be boffo at the box office. After a packed screening at the 
Hollywood Pacific (where, outside, fans chanted, "Ah-nald! Ah-nald!" when 
"Total Recall" star Schwarzenegger arrived), Columbia hosted a party at 
Griffith Observatory, where guests were treated to laser shows, dancing, 
psychics, tarot card and palm readers and a great view of L.A. from the roof. 
Guests could gaze at the grid and privately hope that, someday, all that would 
be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Ronny Cox, one of the film's co-stars, summed it up when he excitedly 
said to a friend, "I think the buzz on this is good." While some seemed alarmed 
by the film's screechy noise level, spurting blood and high body count, most 
seemed sure it would bring in audiences -- even if they have to pay the new 
inflated ticket price of $7.50 at some theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Schwarzenegger, with his wife, Maria Shriver, and his mother, 
Aurelia; director Paul Verhoeven, co-stars Michael Ironside, Rachel Ticotin and 
Sharon Stone; plus Mimi Rogers, Grace Jones, Paul Michael Glaser, Debbie Allen, 
Jack and Elaine LaLanne, Mr. T, Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Pat Riley, Tony 
Danza, Pierce Brosnan, Wayne Gretzky and wife Janet Jones, Michael Nouri, Ivan 
Reitman, Sandra Bernhard, Robert Davi, Lou Ferrigno, Julian Sands, Esai 
Morales, Timothy and Barbara Leary, and Sondra Locke. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Standouts in the mostly business-suited crowd included Mr. T's neon 
graffiti-printed shorts and jacket accessorized with his usual colossal 
collection of gold chains; Grace Jones' slinky grape-colored dress and 
painted-on eyebrows; Debbie Allen's hot-pink satin pouf jacket; Jack LaLanne's 
red and black pin-striped suit; Wayne Gretzky's stubble, and Mimi Rogers' 
tailored jacket over low-cut T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Along Came Mary fed the hungry troops buffet-style, with mini-hamburgers, 
onion rings, pizza, scallop skewers, baby racks of lamb, and sundaes, cookies 
and brownies. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Who is Schwarzenegger's toughest critic? His mother, of course. But not 
to worry -- "She loved it," he said. "I always ask her what she thinks. She 
thought the action was great, all the futuristic things." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I knew I needed earplugs for the Roxy, but I didn't think I'd need 
to bring them to a movie," said one woman whose ears were still ringing an hour 
after the movie had ended. 
</P>
<P>
A Movie by Any Other Name . . .: One industry wag has already re-dubbed the 
film, "Like, I Recall -- Totally!" 
</P>
<P>
OK, but Is There Going to Be a Total Recall II?: Not directed by Verhoeven, it 
seems. "I don't think I could do this again," he admitted. "I'd get kind of 
bored, probably."

STUCK WITH THE DOGS OF WINTER; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: AS RETAILERS ADD UP THEIR HOLIDAY SALES, SEVERAL MUCH-BALLYHOOED 
PRODUCTS STAND OUT AS DUDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neon bicycle pants and T-shirts flickered out. Books about the environment are 
heading to the dump. And the movie "Bonfire of the Vanities" is going up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In a Christmas season of weak consumer spending and widespread economic pain, 
these seem to be among the biggest commercial flops. 
</P>
<P>
Marketers went into the holidays knowing that Americans were worried about the 
economy and reluctant to part with their dollars. So, many merchants took few 
chances -- by and large, they stocked their shelves with conservative fashions 
or products that appeared to be proven winners. 
</P>
<P>
Stores also tried to keep their inventories lean to avoid getting stuck with 
piles of surprise losers. "We didn't have any big dogs," said Gail Dorn, a 
spokeswoman for Target Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were Christmas duds aplenty. Take, for example, the parade of 
dolls designed to compete with Mattel's ever-popular Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were Matchbox's Real Models, including likenesses of Christie 
Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson. They found out that Barbie is one 
tough cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who goes against Barbie gets their head handed to them," said Larry 
Carlat, editor of the trade publication Toy &amp; Hobby World. "Most little 
girls see these dolls as Barbie's friends, and girls would rather have Barbie 
than a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, action figures aimed mainly at boys -- among them, Beetlejuice and 
Police Academy characters -- were thrashed by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
a repeat hit from last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of last year's hot toys thrived again this year. Sales of Micro 
Machines -- inch-long replicas of cars -- sped downhill. In fact, many 
consumers turned away from the favorites of past years in the toy business and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Carlat said the action figures based on the hit television show, "The 
Simpsons," weren't "an out-and-out bomb or a stiff, but they didn't do nearly 
as well as expected." He said the figures arrived in toy stores too late, in 
October, after "Simpson mania" subsided. 
</P>
<P>
This year's books about the environment arrived too late and too numerous. 
"None of them sold," said an executive for Crown Books, the biggest bookseller 
in Southern California. "By the Christmas of 1990, people had had enough." 
</P>
<P>
"They all are on recycled paper, but it's still going to mean throwing away a 
lot of paper," the executive added. "That's the ironic thing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Crown's biggest disappointments: "Just a Dream," a children's story 
about ecology, written by Chris Van Allsburg, author of the previous 
best-seller "Polar Express." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive gift and coffee table books also faltered, with the $30 price level 
being a breaking point. But there was at least one major exception to the rule: 
One of the season's biggest hits was "The Civil War: An Illustrated History," a 
companion to the public television miniseries. It sold at some chains for the 
full list price of $50. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cookbooks staged a comeback. Biographies and autobiographies also 
did relatively well, including books about movie actress Ava Gardner, football 
and baseball star Bo Jackson and television newsman Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
But former President Ronald Reagan's memoir, "An American Life," was a 
disappointment even though it made the best-seller lists. It trailed "Millie's 
Book," the dog's-eye view of the White House ghost-written by First Lady 
Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a joke in the industry," said Neal Webb, marketing director for 
Ingram Book Co., one of the nation's biggest book wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
In the fashion business, the neon fad faded, particularly on skin-tight bicycle 
pants. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the baby boomers are now past 40, and they can't afford 
liposuction," said Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
Loose sweat suits fared much better, and men's neckties with bold or playful 
prints were an undisputed hit. 
</P>
<P>
Other mass market fashion flops were corduroy, cowboy boots and, in particular, 
suede and leather coats. Millstein explained that because leather is so 
durable, many people who bought flight jackets and other leather apparel in 
past years don't need to replace it yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the sluggish consumer electronics business, electronic piano keyboards were 
probably the biggest disappointment, said Louis Block, vice president of 
merchandising for the Philadelphia-based Silo chain. After several years of 
selling briskly, keyboards are being hurt by competition from Nintendo and 
other video games, Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits of the season, though, also was a consumer electronics 
product: the $60 Video Plus, an easy-to-use remote-control device for 
programming VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Along with buying gifts, people normally flock to the movies during the 
holidays. This year, though, such highly promoted films as "Bonfire of the 
Vanities" and "Havana" have gotten off to weak starts. "Rockie V" also has been 
less than a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Their box office receipts may have been hurt by the glut of holiday season 
releases, with nine major films coming out since Dec. 19. In some cases, pans 
by critics may have hurt too. 
</P>
<P>
Citing two of the biggest Christmas hits, "Kindergarten Cop" and "Home Alone," 
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Amdec Securities suggested that "stories won 
out over stars." He said moviegoers also seem interested in cheerful stories, 
perhaps as an escape from all of the economic gloom. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception was the explosive box office debut on Christmas Day of "The 
Godfather Part III," which Logsdon attributed partly to the loyal following 
developed by the first two Godfather movies. 
</P>
<P>
Novelty items, as usual, had mixed results. Neiman Marcus stores, the tony 
retailer long known for its fancy, unconventional gifts, fared well with its 
$95 Silly Putty in an engraved sterling silver egg. The chain also succeeded 
with the 18-karat Golden Slinky, which went for $55. 
</P>
<P>
But Neiman Marcus' 25-hour clock, costing $82, was a disaster. Its claim to 
fame is that it shaves 2.4 seconds off of every minute, but what purpose that 
serves is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people don't want more hours in the day, they want fewer," said Neiman 
Marcus spokeswoman Pat Zajac. "It must have something to do with stress 
management."

out of the remote areas which are already filled with older, established
mountain lions, and out into settled areas.";    Fitzhugh went on to say: "In
the last couple of months we've had cougar sightings on the University of
California-Davis campus. A radio-collared female in a mountain lion study unit
east of Fresno wandered 270 miles north and was captured in town.";    (In
California, Proposition 117 was passed in 1990, banning hunting of mountain
lions. Actually, there has been no season on mountain lions in the state since
1984.);    Gary Power, a biologist with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game,
described an incident in which a clerk in a rural convenience store heard a
noise and looked up to see a young cougar padding silently out of the store
with her puppy clenched in its jaws.;    Kathy Green, a biologist with the
Colorado Division of Wildlife, reported cougars on the patios of Boulder
hospitals, cougars flattened on highways near Denver, cougars chasing joggers
up trees.;    "It just seems like there's cats everywhere," she said.;    Two
of them backed a woman jogger up a tree last summer and climbed after her
until she whacked them over the head. Last January, a young male cougar killed
an 18-year-old student jogging behind his Idaho Springs, Colo., high school.; 
  Mike Aderhold of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, blamed
Montana's recent lion problem on the high deer population. Deer is a cougar's
natural prey.;    "People who lure deer to their property with salt blocks and
feed also pull in their predators," he said.;    The mountain lion or cougar
-- also called puma, panther, painter, catamount or, properly, Felix concolor
-- roams 20,000 to 30,000 strong west of the Mississippi River and eats every
animal from skunks to moose, with deer-sized mammals as its principal prey.;  
 Silent, furtive, once called the Ghosts of North America, the cougar has been
known to kill and drag off 600-pound cattle. Pioneers 300 years ago described
its "woman-like scream.";    Many today fear the big cats are becoming a
menace to human life as they saunter into cities and towns.;    Hunters fear a
growing lion population will kill too many deer and elk. They favor controlled
sport hunting of cougars to relieve the pressure on game herds, reduce
livestock depredation and attacks on humans, at the same time raising money
for cougar management without jeopardizing western cougar populations.;   
This idea is violently rejected by a large contingent of westerners who see
the tawny cats as magnificent predators that have been unjustly persecuted for
decades and now are threatened with imminent extinction.  </TEXT>

BENEFACTORS SOUND OFF AT WAYNE CANCER CLINIC BENEFIT LUNCHEON

A charity fashion show featuring chic cocktail dresses and gowns seemed the 
perfect place to find out what cogent comments women have about the current 
state of evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find clothes within a certain price category," one woman said 
emphatically. "You can find them for $300 and $3,000, but that in-between price 
is hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for something that when I walk into a room every one of us doesn't 
have on the same outfit," said another. 
</P>
<P>
The women were surveyed during the John Wayne Cancer Clinic (at UCLA) 
Auxiliary's annual membership luncheon/fashion show/fund-raiser Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
This group of supporters (99% were women) gathered in the ballroom of the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills to view the 1990 Neiman Marcus gown 
collection in a runway show titled "A Little Night Magic," produced by David 
Cardoza. Body-hugging evening wear by Vicky Tiel, Bob Mackie's trademark glitzy 
sequins and Isabelle Allard's slinky black lace gowns were paraded down the 
runway by models in the highest heels and Bardot hair. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the 550 women present spoke plainly about the lack of affordable, 
elegant evening wear needed to maneuver through the upcoming hectic social 
season in style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offended when I go into Chanel and somebody tells me that the jacket's 
$3,000 and the skirt's another $1,600. I'm not going to buy it," said Gretchen 
Wayne, wife of Michael Wayne and a member of the auxiliary's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should be able to dress well and not look like everybody else. We 
need to have better quality in the clothing too, at a price that's within 
reason for the people who are shopping. I'm not shy about spending money at 
all, but I don't want to wear something that looks like a uniform. Otherwise 
I'll go back to wearing my high school uniform." 
</P>
<P>
"Every year the John Wayne Cancer Clinic has a benefactor's event in December, 
and I'll be needing a gown for that, and one for our auxiliary's major 
fund-raiser in April," said Jackie Banchik, president of the auxiliary, who 
wore a white pique suit with gold embroidery. "If I don't start looking now, 
forget it. Because I'm small, it's hard for me to find things." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Lubin and Elaine Lerman, co-chairs of the luncheon, were pinning their 
hopes on New York designer Pamela Dennis, whose cocktail dresses and gowns were 
featured in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We can wear her clothes," said Lubin. "They're great for women in their 50s." 
</P>
<P>
"She has the freshest, most wonderful look of any new designer I've seen," 
added Lerman. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, 30, who came to the show, said she never designs a collection without 
listening to her customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of trunk shows," she said, "and I do listen to these women. I'm not 
just in this to make things that sit on a rack. They tell me they want to look 
classy but sexy at the same time. She really wants her husband to say, 'Wow!' I 
mean, that's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
But not all the talk at the luncheon was about clothes. Celebrity host Jill 
Eikenberry (there with husband Michael Tucker) spoke of her battle with breast 
cancer and stressed the need for support and care of anyone faced with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
So did honorary chairwoman Susan Dobson, who told of her mother's bout with 
pancreatic cancer that doctors told her would take her life in three to six 
months. She then introduced her healthy mother to the crowd to wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Other guests were Michele Lee and Joan Van Ark; Joyce Green, executive director 
of the clinic; and more Wayne clan members, including Michael Wayne, Toni Wayne 
LaCava and Melinda Wayne Munoz. Dr. Donald L. Morton, chief of the cancer 
clinic, was presented with a check for $360,000, representing the money raised 
last year from the auxiliary's events.

<HEAD>Lacroix Springs Summerwear, But Luxe Are Deceiving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix woke up the fashion crowd Sunday
with his show of bright, peppy clothes in ready-to-wear and
``luxe'' versions for the 1990 summer season.
   Both lines showed some leggy looks, long pants and Lacroix's
curvy cuts. ``Luxe'' was simply richer than ready-to-wear, and will
cost a few thousand dollars more per outfit.
   In both shows, he included some of his oval skirts and fitted
jackets, plus a few of his famous fichu collars and trapeze-line
coats and dresses. Pants ranged from full and cropped to
``cigarette'' slim, under tunic tops and dressy jackets.
   The slightly simplified, sportier ready-to-wear lines led off
with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants, and
color burst out from there on _ often with Lacroix's ebullient
mixes of flowers, checks, plaids.
   It was a sunny, summery collection of high spirits by the young
creator from the sunny south of France, showing sunhats and
beachwear galore this time.
   While many designers were bringing out lots of rusty, even muddy
autumn colors, Lacroix went out for a fresh palette of pinks, reds,
violet, pistachio and chartreuse, in clothes that often came out
looking younger than springtime.
   His fitted suits of huge houndstooth checks came out in
turquoise or chartreuse and black for a striking city look. But the
daisy-printed floral Provencal cotton jackets paired with full
short skirts in a different print were happy-go-lucky Lacroix at
his best.
   He showed a lot of leg in the bloomer shorts or skirts and
bright pistachio or pink linen jackets with big jeweled collars.
   Lacroix's simplest line involved delicate mixes of pastel
twinsets and chocolate brown pleated skirts or straight pants. The
pearl-buttoned knit toppers had puffed organza sleeves rimmed in
gold.
   While some of the brightest patchworks with heart and star print
motifs came out in trapeze-line dresses, much of the collection was
based on sexy bustier tops, especially in multicolored lame brocade
cocktail dresses.
   The ``luxe'' clothes were sometimes dolled up with so much lace
and glitz that the chic was nearly hidden. But there were also some
fabulous clothes in this near-couture line.
   Some of the sweetness nearly got out of hand in this show _ with
the sequined, pink or blue taffeta-ruffled, lace-edged wraparound
dresses _ as the loudspeaker warbled ``May Time,'' by Jeannette
MacDonald.
   Even the ``tiger ladies'' in their chiffon animal prints looked
more innocent than wild, though one was a clinging, ruffled and
gathered number to outline an hourglass figure.
   The chiffons ranged from nice navy numbers with ``godet''
flounces at the knee-length hem for dancing, to some wonderful pink
and raspberry flower prints draped with a big scarf fastened with
an outsized rose at the shoulder.
   Black lace, navy pleated chiffon and sparkling embroidery on
short dresses and pajama outfits topped by tunics ended up this
show that offered the ultimate in dressy summer wear.
   Luxury in a totally different vein was laid on with heavier
brush strokes by Romeo Gigli in his second Paris show.
   Currently the darling of the fashion world, Gigli, 39, prefers
the madcap Paris fashion whirl to his native Italy for showing his
clothes. After last spring's hit show, this second offering was
played to a packed, enthusiastic house.
   It was a case where the clothes wore the women. Models minced
down the runway looking barely able to walk, constrained by silky,
gossamer shoulder wraps, puffed tutu-skirt effects over lean silk
trousers worn with colored tights and flat sandals.
   The outfits were treated as artwork. They ranged between
Byzantine and Oriental opulence, with the most dazzling iridescent
silks, lace, velvet, gold-threaded sheer fabrics often in the burnt
colors of autumn.
   It was like looking at a series of paintings rather than clothes
to wear to a party. Full, stiffened tent-like shortie coats over
figured pants had the look of hieratic characters in a Byzantine
mosaic, especially with the flowing pearled earrings bigger than
chandeliers draped over the shoulders.
   But Gigli can cut, and his slim iridescent or metallic lame silk
tail-coats looked wonderful over slim pants.
   Martine Sitbon brought out dozens of sailor suits, a couple of
Batman types in body stockings and capes and a few cowgirl styles.
At the opposite end of the spectrum from Gigli, Sitbon showed peppy
clothes that were mainly for the young.
   In tones of navy or rust linen, the seagoing set was decked out
in vests and middy collars or battle jackets with striped shirts up
top. Below decks it was short corsair or long bell-bottomed
trousers _ and a perky shorts-jumpsuit for good measure.

<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix kicked off a week of haute
couture shows for winter Sunday with plenty of luxury and an
about-face in style, abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him
famous and presenting a variety of styles.
   His show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers
and press, but there was no screaming ovation, as there was at last
year's.
   Some found the show rather confusing, as if Lacroix didn't
always know what to do with all that lovely fabric. In clothes
aimed at opulence, the effect was sometimes perfect, sometimes
awkward or heavy-looking.
   But most agreed these clothes look much more wearable than the
past _ even though couture is only worn by a handful of women who
pay astronomical prices, well up in the thousands of dollars, for a
simple dress.
   Lacroix kept his sense of fun in bright miniskirts with full
paisley overskirts, worn with jeweled suede boots and an oversized
hat.
   His new suit looks varied. One red model with a long jacket and
short skirt was a dead ringer for the Chanel style. Another is the
short-long effect with the billowing overskirt to offset a shorter
skirt underneath.
   The full pantskirts or flowing pajamas were sometimes given a
buttoned-up, high-waisted sailor suit look, dressed up with mink
capes or fox jackets. Cowl hoods and draped fichu collars are still
Lacroix trademarks.
   The great invention of the collection was a tuxedo. It came out
as a smashing dark crepe jumpsuit with big rhinestone buttons,
large white satin lapels and cuffs on the jacket.
   The evening gowns were varied and elaborate, with brown in
brocades, chiffons and velvet a big favorite. But Lacroix juggled
his palette throughout the show, alternating combinations of hot
colors with softly graded combinations.
   A midnight blue velvet sheath with its topping of a puffy bow
and train of many-hued brown, blue and grey tulle was a knockout.
   Following the Lacroix show was the evening wear at Hanae Mori's
show.
   Each carefully made black-gray-white model drifted out painted
or decorated with seagulls and waves, birds, butterflies and trees.
Dresses featured large leaf patterns and trim.
   Mrs. Mori showed a wearable collection of outfits that showed
the knee, emphasized intricate draping and detail and brought out
some flyaway toppers, shorter in the front.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "In the Corridors of </F>
Power": "It Is a Dark Night in the Russian Federation Procuracy"] 
  [Text] After the unexpected resignation of A. 
Kazannik, Aleksey Ilyushenko was appointed acting general 
procurator of the Russian Federation. His name is linked in the 
mind of many people with the so-called "Rutskoy case." Let us 
recall that the case went into high gear along with the 
intensification of the political crisis and involved charges of 
corruption against the former vice president. It was alleged 
that he had something to do with foreign currency accounts in 
Switzerland, as well as ownership of the Trade Links company. 
But is it legitimate to assume that A. Ilyushenko's appointment 
is associated only with the "Rutskoy case"? 
  This is what we have been able to find out in the 
general procuracy from various sources, since A. Ilyushenko 
himself refrains from comment. 
  On the eve of the elections and referendum on 12 December, 
the Moscow procuracy closed the corruption case against A. 
Rutskoy. Note that public comments on this event came from 
investigator M. Slinko instead of Moscow Procurator G. 
Ponomarev, who chose to remain silent. Then the "case" went for 
review by the General Procuracy-- the sphere of supervision of 
A. Kazannik (whose principled stance we all seemed to have seen 
proof of). After that, three top specialists independently come 
to the conclusion that "...the decision to close the criminal 
case regarding A. Rutskoy should be revoked... The General 
Procuracy should be tasked with further investigation of the 
criminal case by reason of the scale of the criminal case and a 
large number of questions requiring establishment of contacts on 
a federal level. I. Bobrovskiy, the general procurator's 
assistant for special tasks." 31 January 1994. 
  This document, as well as a number of others, prompted A. 
Kazannik to speak up at the General Procuracy collegium at the 
end of February. "Three of our best specialists, for the purpose 
of ensuring legitimacy, studied the materials independently of 
one another. All of them came to the conclusion that the Moscow 
City Procuracy did not answer a single question. In addition, 
the investigation had been conducted with gross violations of 
the norms of criminal law, in particular, Article 67 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Process Code... Moscow investigators 
are threatening to charge persons who have handed over documents 
with slander. I am not sure, however, who should be charged 
under Article 130 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code." 
  The aforementioned Moscow procuracy investigators were not 
present at the collegium. Moscow Procurator G. Ponomarev, 
however, was present and sat in the presidium. He, however, 
remains silent to this day. The man who is still talking is the 
same M. Slinko, with respect to whom the principled A. Kazannik 
had his doubts. 
  All in all, after a number of meetings with procuracy staff 
one gets the impression that the procuracy, torn apart by 
politicians, is now completely demoralized. Despite the experts' 
conclusion and A. Kazannik's statement, six volumes of the 
"Rutskoy case" ended up in the General Procuracy, and another 10 
volumes--in the Moscow City Procuracy... There is every reason 
to believe, however, that the conclusions of A. Kazannik's 
commission will indeed prevail and "the case of A. Rutskoy's 
trust" will be brought to a logical conclusion. In any case, 
Canadian notary public Chapnik, who continues to maintain that 
he had notarized genuine documents with a genuine signature, is 
at this point well and alive. Besides, it is possible that after 
the conversation with Russian investigators, Chapnik himself 
will come under charges of perjury. Then he will face criminal 
prosecution in Canada.

<TEXT>
   Fashion was a high-style spectacle last week as
couture designers unveiled their extravagant clothes in opulent
fabrics for winter of 1989-90.
   The idea this season is sexy rather than power dressing.
   Most couturiers have backed off from the big padded shoulder
after Christian Lacroix led the way two seasons ago. But Saint
Laurent and Givenchy still believe that padding gives the right
shape to suit jackets.
   Skirt lengths are irrelevant. The many knee-baring skirts still
look appealing for those with good legs, especially when the skirts
are given the tulip-wrap treatment. But some longer lengths looked
fine too, at influential houses like Saint Laurent and Chanel.
   There was a lot of ``retro'' around, not least at the house of
Dior, where the Italian designer, Gianfranco Ferre, took a look at
the first Dior New Look of 1947 and whipped up his own version.
   Although a newcomer to the Paris shows, Ferre won the season's
top couture prize, the Golden Thimble, for his beautifully
constructed clothes that had dashes of daring, such as the sequined
chevron-tweed suits.
   Ferre's Dior evening wear showed huge organza bows at the neck,
the strapless and wasp-waisted dresses with stiffened tulle
underskirts, plus ornamental bouquets of lilies of the valley.
   Some customers didn't buy all of Ferre's ideas. A Texan who has
her own mannequin for fittings at Dior said, ``No way I'd buy those
complicated clothes. They're too bulky for packing.''
   Another Italian, Gianni Versace, had the last word of the week,
placing his ``atelier'' couture models on headless mannequins in
the Jacquemart-Andre Museum. The party was attended by several
celebrities, including Joan Collins, dressed in form-fitting ruby
satin, Marisa Berenson in a bead-embroidered Versace tunic and
Isabelle Huppert in an easy-fitted beige silk dress.
   Christian Lacroix's offhand mixing of fabrics in his short
fitted suits and big accessories showed him in good form, though
some observers thought this was not his best collection.
   Saint Laurent's fans were glad to know that he kept his daytime
wear strictly conservative, with a sharply-tailored silhouette,
long or bolero jackets with padded shoulders, a few blousons and
several flowing capes.
   Most of Saint Laurent's evening wear had a true touch of magic.
His flower-shaped short evening dresses in brocade lames were truly
fabulous, with their stiffened wing-like collars and skirt wraps.
   Karl Lagerfeld's riding jacket for Chanel stole the show.
   The most memorable outfit in this curvaceous line was the
decollete off-the-shoulder outsized houndstooth-check jacket, worn
with a wispy chiffon skirt.
   Chanel and virtually everyone else in Paris showed fabulous lame
``damasked'' fabrics and brocades, along with frothy dollops of
Chantilly lace and embroidered tulle, satin and chiffon. But rich
velvets and taffetas and faille turned up as well.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer interpreted evening wear as a dazzling magic
carpet of shimmering fabrics in fitted short suits, long gowns and
tunics with pants for a thousand and one nights of rich revelry on
the exotic road to India.
   The hot new color to remember this fall will be chocolate _
dark, milky or pinkish like cinnamon. And it gets mixed in with
shades like coral or aqua to lighten things up. Pearly grays at
Dior looked superb.
   While it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and
show most these couture collections _ and only a few women can
afford the outfits costing well upwards of $10,000 _ couture is
considered useful.
   The showy clothes serve as prototypes for luxury ready-to-wear,
and they give a house and its designer an image and reputation to
fuel sales of everything from accessories to makeup and perfume.
