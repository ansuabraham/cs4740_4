The government of the Faroe Islands has awarded a licence for seismic
surveys on the Faroese continental shelf to the American company Western
Geophysical Corporation, of Houston, Texas.
The licence marks the beginning of the Faroe Island's programme to explore
for hydrocarbons in its offshore continental shelf area.
BP has made a substantial oil discovery south-east of the Faroe Islands and
close to the dividing line between the Faroes' and the British sectors, over
which there is an unresolved dispute between the two countries.
The Faroe Islands is a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Economically the group is almost entirely dependent on fisheries. It is in
the throes of a serious depression caused by falling stocks and prices of
fish. Denmark has had to pump substantial sums of money into the the
islands' to prevent total economic collapse. Against this background, the
islands' government is pinning its hopes on hydrocarbons prospects.

THE Danish government has agreed to hand over all rights to exploit minerals
in the Faroe Islands and Faroese offshore waters to the Faroese government.
This resolves a dispute between the Danes and the Faroes, which has been one
of the main obstacles to exploring for hydrocarbons off the North Atlantic
islands, where geologists consider that the chances of finding oil and gas
are good.
But a new dispute, this time between Denmark and the UK, is threatening to
halt prospecting.
The Faroe Islands are a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark,
but foreign and defence policy remain the preserve of the metropolitan
government in Copenhagen. The UK and Denmark are in dispute over the
territorial demarcation line in offshore areas west of the Shetland Islands
and south-east of the Faroe Islands.
According to the Danish foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
proposed British line of demarcation is too close to the Faroe Islands and
is totally unacceptable to Denmark. Denmark claims that the demarcation line
should run about halfway between the Faroes and the Shetlands.
Negotiations are taking place between Denmark and the UK, with the next
meeting fixed for October 21 in London. If the dispute cannot be resolved by
negotiation, the Danes have indicated that they will take it to the
International Court at the Hague. Until the dispute is settled, it is
thought unlikely that contracts will be awarded to oil and gas companies to
begin exploration.
There is a separate dispute over the demarcation line in the north-west
Atlantic, where Britain's claim that Rockall should be the pivot of the line
is not accepted by either Denmark or Ireland.

 [Interview with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland by Othar Ruehl in Oslo; date not given: "Russia Is a 
Great Nation, We Have To Take It Seriously"] 
  [Text] [Ruehl] If Norway is to become a member of the 
European Union [EU] in 1995 -- along with Sweden, Finland, 
Austria -- there will be a fundamental change in the political 
structure and internal balance of the union envisaged by the 
Maastricht union. Will the union be less cohesive? 
  [Brundtland] I do not think so. That is because at its 
meeting in Lisbon, the EU Council decided that the expansion 
should proceed on the basis of the existing balance. However, 
there will, of course, be new discussions once a country is 
admitted. We will enter such discussion without any 
preconceptions. 
  [Ruehl] But does this expansion toward the north and 
northeast not mean that there will be a geopolitical change, 
especially for Russia? 
  [Brundtland] Yes, because if one views such a move from a 
historical angle, against the background of the Cold War, then 
northern Europe was geographically and militarily close to the 
focal point of East-West confrontation, if only because of 
Russia's access to the Atlantic and the USSR's strategic 
complex, the North Sea Fleet, and the submarines that could 
launch missiles based at Kola. The "northern balance" in the 
Cold War became apparent after Norway and Denmark joined NATO in 
1949, while Sweden and Finland remained neutral. That was how 
everything was settled. With the collapse of the Soviet empire, 
this eastern barrier disappeared and the road to the West was 
opened up. All of northern Europe now has the possibility of 
embarking on the EU path, so that it can then have a common 
border with Russia, one that will include Norway's border with 
Russia in the north and the entire Russo-Finnish border. This 
is now part of the European reality. However, if one looks back 
to the time when the Soviet Union still existed, then one also 
realizes that all the countries here in the north had good 
relations with Soviet Russia; trade, cross-border traffic, and 
relations in general were good. That will also make future 
European policy vis-a-vis Russia simpler. The three northern 
European countries will make a significant contribution in this 
respect. 
  [Ruehl] So, you share a view that is widespread in Moscow, 
namely, that an expansion of the EU could be a way of pressuring 
Russia? Some would see it as an advance staged by the Western 
bloc of states or, in any event, by a strong military grouping. 
For example, the head of the Russian intelligence service, 
Primakov, spoke of the dangers of the West's offensive military 
capacity in connection with NATO. 
  [Brundtland] I do not think that such views reflect current 
Russian thinking about West Europe. The Russians have the 
experience of cooperating with Norway, Finland, and Sweden. 
This has enabled them to develop confidence in the northern 
European countries, in the fact that those countries desire to 
live in peace in the region along with Russia, without 
confrontation and to the exclusion of no one. With the "Barents 
initiative," Norway made a proposal for the further development 
of regional cooperation that was taken up by Russia. The 
proposal envisages cooperation in the fields of business, 
ecology, technology, and culture -- cooperation extending beyond 
borders and involving the northern European countries, Russia, 
the United States, and the EU. Russia understands a positive 
initiative of this kind. Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that 
it would be advantageous from the Russian viewpoint for Norway 
to be a member of the EU. Some people were surprised by that, 
but I was not. 
  [Ruehl] Would that also apply to an expansion of the EU in 
the north and in the Baltic region? 
  [Brundtland] As a NATO member, Norway is an associate member 
of the Western European Union [WEU]. We also want to become 
full members of the WEU as soon as we have joined the EU. That 
also depends, of course, on how the Norwegian people vote on the 
admission treaty. We want to be able to function fully in both 
organizations, because we cannot be only members of the EU or 
alternatively, only members of the WEU. Norway will then be an 
active partner in the common foreign and security policies 
envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty and contribute to their 
development. That is our goal. 
  [Ruehl] Does this mean that Norway will also advocate 
enhancing the status of the WEU as a "European pillar" within 
NATO? Should one try, in the course of expanding the EU, to make 
more of the WEU than has been the case so far? The WEU has in 
fact already assumed the tasks of the alliance's European group 
of partners and has established direct relations with NATO in 
Brussels. 
  [Brundtland] I am not sure about that question until we are 
in the EU. At this point, I cannot judge how different roles 
should best be assigned to the EU and WEU in the future. I want 
to see how things function within the EU. One must also 
consider the fact that the European partners in the EU cooperate 
much more closely within the EU than within the WEU or NATO. 
The EU foreign ministers meet each other more often, more than 
once a month, which means that political consultations at the 
governmental level are the most frequent within the EU. These 
meetings mean that there is an ongoing dialogue and a process of 
reaching agreement. There is no doubt that this central 
relationship within the EU will be the basis of common policy 
and will have a vital function in determining European security 
interests and security policy tasks. At the head of government 
and foreign minister level, the European governments formulate 
common NATO policy and represent the decisions made by their 
countries with NATO in the same way as they do within the EU in 
the case of European affairs. This is the background against 
which one must consider what is left for the WEU as a "European 
pillar." Countries and their governments are always the key 
elements. 
  [Ruehl] To ensure its security, Norway has in the past 
primarily relied on the United States and Great Britain to 
protect NATO's northern flank and has insisted on an adequate 
U.S. presence on the northern flank with the provision of 
reinforcements from the United States and the U.S. Atlantic 
fleet for crises deployment in the Norwegian Sea. Has something 
changed for Norway in this respect following the end of the 
Soviet Union or does Oslo still always look across the Atlantic 
to the distant west and count on a strategic umbrella and a 
military commitment on the part of the United States? 
  [Brundtland] We are still of the opinion that the 
transatlantic bond should not be weakened. In Europe, one would 
no longer have security or would not have security at the same 
level if this bond were weakened. One can say that as a 
Norwegian, but also as a German, a Briton, and even as a 
Frenchman, which is something that the French have incidentally 
recognized in the meantime. The Norwegian Government has 
constantly lobbied the U.S. Administration and the Congress in 
Washington to maintain, not reduce the U.S. military presence on 
Norway's coastline and northern flank. In view of reductions in 
the military budget, particularly the U.S. one, and the 
restructuring of the U.S. Armed Forces, we have been emphasizing 
the fact that the transatlantic link and U.S. military forces 
are still needed. The alliance's strength and Europe's security 
is based on the sum total of European and North American defense 
efforts. 
  [Ruehl] Should this support be extended to the Baltic and 
eastern Central Europe by expanding NATO eastward? 
  [Brundtland] I think that we should leave things in the form 
that was decided on at the NATO Council meeting in January. The 
offer of Partnership for Peace [PFP] to all European countries 
that do not belong to NATO, which also means all the countries 
to the east of the alliance, makes it possible to hold 
discussions with everyone about their specific circumstances, 
and on the basis of the actual situation of each country, look 
at a given country's security needs, at what obligations it can 
assume, and what contributions it can make. In any event, there 
will be a bilateral relationship between a given country and 
NATO and not simply a security guarantee issued by NATO. NATO 
made that a precondition for these new partnerships before the 
offer was made in Brussels. It is a good solution. 
  [Ruehl] Do you consider the PFP to be an experiment or a 
fixed program, a model enabling NATO to organize European 
security beyond alliance territory? 
  [Brundtland] I view it as a flexible process that will allow 
experience to be acquired. Now that some countries have 
accepted the offer, a certain dynamic can be set in motion that 
will parallel the expansion of the EU. The process will take 
several years and create a network of bilateral ties between 
NATO and other states. 
  [Ruehl] This leads one back to the question of a special 
security partnership between NATO and Russia. President Yeltsin 
and Foreign Minister Kozyrev have expressed concern that a new 
form of confrontation might not necessarily come into being, but 
that a new dividing line might appear in Europe, one created by 
the West. Kozyrev even warned France against reviving the 1920's 
policy of a "cordon sanitaire to isolate Russia." 
  [Brundtland] Well, that is one aspect of an analysis of the 
situation in Europe. NATO started a discussion about these 
issues, about the relationship to Russia, and the result was the 
January council resolution with an offer that also applies to 
Russia so as to prevent the appearance of a new dividing line 
between Europe and Russia. Earlier Russian statements conveyed 
concern and expressed warnings about pursuing a policy that 
would exclude Russia. Nothing of that sort occurred in Brussels 
in January. That is why the PFP has also been offered to 
Russia. No new barriers should be erected. 
  [Ruehl] With regard to security, President Yeltsin always 
returns to the same point: Russian participation in a special 
relationship with NATO and, incidentally, a bilateral 
relationship with the United States, one between two nuclear 
superpowers with a great military potential. Evidently, he 
wants more than the partnership offer, something very special, 
something appropriate to Russia's significance and not the 
expansion of NATO to cover the territory of the former Warsaw 
Pact. He has been talking about the "geopolitical balance" in 
1990, which should not be changed in a way that would be to 
Russia's disadvantage. He has also proposed a "joint security 
guarantee" given to other states by both NATO and Russia instead 
of admission to NATO, and he has taken up what Clinton said 
about a "strategic partnership with Russia." 
  [Brundtland] In its declaration, the NATO Council avoided 
potentially negative aspects in that sense. This period of 
history is not one in which one could have a division of power 
in Europe, a "condominium" between two superpowers, or the 
creation of "strategic spheres of interest." The days of empire 
and hegemony are over, as Yeltsin himself said. However, the 
rejection of such ideas does not mean that one should fail to 
take account of Russia's history and interests. Indeed, it 
means that one must take account of Russia's interests with 
respect to economic development, to participate in European 
institutions and international agreements such as the GATT 
customs and trade treaty, and to have an input into the kind of 
"mixed economy" that we have in the West. That is because none 
of us lives in a "capitalist society." In our free market 
economies, we have a public sector alongside a private sector. 
The East European countries, including Russia, could develop in 
line with this model of a "mixed economy." 
  [Ruehl] Let's stay with this model. As part of the EU, 
what could northern Europe do in the Baltic region? 
  [Brundtland] Our goal is to develop and consolidate 
democracy. That applies to all the East European countries, but, 
of course, also to Russia, with which we live in the same part 
of Europe. Our own security needs dictate that we support the 
development of democracy and a cooperative attitude on the part 
of Russia toward its neighbors, beginning with the Baltic 
states, whose development we are also assisting and that also 
look toward northern Europe. The northern European countries 
have a democratic tradition, one composed of a social democracy 
along with a "mixed economy," in which the state is also active. 
This could provide a model for the East European countries. 
Europe must view the opening up of the East as a historic 
challenge. The EU now has the possibility of acquiring a truly 
pan-European significance -- to go beyond a single market and 
political union -- and to become more than just a customs and 
monetary union for an economic region, although that in itself 
is already of great significance. That is of even greater 
benefit to the countries of East Europe, because only 
cooperation can settle problems with Russia pertaining to the 
present situation and history and thus create a community of 
neighbors between whom, just as in West Europe, there can be no 
confrontation. Of course, it is not easy to balance interests, 
but we can conclude compromises. We will make an effort to 
achieve that. 
  [Ruehl] Thus, should Russia become a G-7 partner? 
  [Brundtland] That is difficult to say today, especially if 
one is not a member oneself. In a certain sense perhaps; it 
depends on the arrangements that are made. In any event, Russia 
is a great nation that must be taken seriously and must 
participate in discussions about the future of the world 
economy. That is in our common interest, because we are all 
involved in developing a democratic society. We are already 
cooperating with Russia in the north and in the Baltic region, 
and Germany and Poland are also involved in that cooperation. 
  [Ruehl] Irrespective of that, what is your opinion of a 
"strategic partnership with Russia," which has also been offered 
by NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner? 
  [Brundtland] We all have an interest in a good relationship 
between the United States and Russia, which also involves 
bilateral relations between the two superpowers and especially 
cooperation with Russia participation on the UN Security 
Council. This should also be given a multilateral institutional 
configuration, covering Russian relations with the EU and NATO 
as well as Russia's position within the CSCE. 
  [Ruehl] We would like to turn to the subject of Bosnia now. 
What conclusions are to be drawn from Western policy on the 
collapse of the Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflict there and 
from what NATO has done? 
  [Brundtland] The main problem in the EU as well as in NATO 
was that the most important partners did not agree on a common 
analysis of the causes of the conflict, criteria for action, and 
common interests in good time. That also had an impact on the 
Security Council. 
  [Ruehl] If one views all these things together: What are 
the implications for European security and the role of various 
organizations, for example, the CSCE, or the WEU and NATO? 
  [Brundtland] As far as the application of CSCE rules and 
principles and the oversight of situations and developments are 
concerned, the CSCE has a positive role. However, in the case 
of preserving or establishing peace, authority lies with the UN 
Security Council, which is alone in having the authority to 
decide on the use of force and sanctions and to issue a mandate 
for specific political or military operations. The United 
Nations is the only organization that has a mandate from all 
nations to act in the name of international security. Outside 
the bounds of collective security, NATO can only act with a UN 
mandate, that is, in the service of NATO. 
  [Ruehl] Through its actions, has the West not played into 
the hands of the parties to the conflict? 
  [Brundtland] The problem is that when this tragedy began, 
the United States and the most influential nations in Europe 
were unable to agree on a common assessment of what was at 
stake. Differing views were expressed for too long a time, and 
the parties to the conflict played these differences off against 
each other, going along with one European opinion on one 
occasion, then switching to another European view or that of the 
United States in order to gain advantages. I hope it has now 
been realized that it is necessary to adopt a common stance 
based on a joint assessment of the situation and a joint concept 
for a policy. The alliance summit resulted in the unanimous 
adoption of basic principles on Bosnia. The difficulties 
involved in reaching agreement and deciding on joint action did 
indeed -- to answer your question -- play into the hands of the 
various parties to the conflict. They used that opportunity in 
dealings with the EU and UN Security Council. We have been 
taught a lesson, a very bitter one, I believe.

In the past two decades European countries have wished on themselves more
than 200 environmental rules. That formidable legislative effort, which
stretches from the levels of sulphur allowed to stream out of power stations
to the circumstances in which you can legally shoot birds, has won immense
public support.
The European Commission, ministers and green campaigners argue that
regulation can bring commercial benefits. Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission's president, has said that 'an ambitious environmental policy . .
. could create hundreds of thousands of jobs'.
But many European countries are concerned that it could be a drag on their
international competitiveness. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has warned
that 'the UK's commitment in principle to environmental protection must not
come at the expense of industry and competitiveness'.
Putting numbers to the cost of environmental protection is not easy, but
industrialists have amassed a long checklist to support their claim that the
green burden is too heavy, particularly in the oil and chemical industries.
Concawe, the oil industry's European environmental lobby, claims the cost of
meeting new limits on sulphur in fuel oils will amount to Dollars 3.3bn in
the short term, and more than Dollars 5bn eventually.
The UK chemical industry estimates spending on environmental protection rose
from 9 per cent of operational costs to 14 per cent between 1990 and 1992.
The German electricity industry has spent DM22bn on cleaning up its power
stations.
The UK water industry says the Urban Waste Water directive, under which
sewage cannot be pumped into the sea, will cost it between Pounds 6bn and
Pounds 12bn, and that roughly half its current Pounds 40bn investment
programme is prompted by European directives.
International comparisons, while difficult to make, support these industrial
snapshots. Figures suggest that environmental rules are hurting European
competit-iveness on several fronts.
For a start, European companies may be handicapped even compared to rivals
in industrialised countries, let alone developing regions. According to the
OECD, total environmental spending by public and private sectors in northern
European countries appears to outstrip that of Canada and Japan, and to be
roughly equivalent to that in the US - around 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent
of GDP.
The Commission's own figures also support northern European companies'
complaints that they face tougher rules than companies in southern Europe.
German spending, the highest in Europe, is roughly double that of Italy,
Portugal and Spain.
Compliance with many rules is lowest in the Mediterranean countries and in
Ireland - as far as anyone can tell. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
environment commissioner, acknowledges figures are incomplete and that 'in
the absence of statistics we cannot say anything' about the degree of
enforcement. He hopes the new European environment agency being established
in Copenhagen will plug these gaps.
The result of high environmental standards, companies say, is that Europe
loses companies and industries. For ICI, the international chemical group,
the need to comply with mercury emission standards was 'the final straw' for
its chlorine plant at Hillhouse, UK, according to Mr Michael Wright,
environmental spokesman. 'We just closed the plant,' he says.
Some people, including many politicians and environmentalists, reject these
fears. They argue that tough rules bring commercial benefits.
Clearly, new markets in environmental technology provide compensations. If
some companies have to clean up, then others can sell them equipment  - UK
water companies have found customers abroad for water treatment devices.
However, some studies argue the potential of these markets has been
overstated.
Moreover, studies agree that these rewards are reaped only by the handful of
countries in the lead - mainly Germany, the US and Japan. Last year the
German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) concluded that, on balance,
environmental regulation had not harmed Germany as a place to do business,
largely because tough standards had helped the environmental technology
industry.
A second claim is that higher energy and waste disposal costs make companies
more efficient. ICI's Mr Wright says that 'rules have given us an incentive
to use less inputs and reduce waste'.
But some dispute whether those gains count as a benefit of green standards.
Mr Wright acknowledges that 'we could have been doing this already without
the regulation, had we focused on it, but it depends where you put your
effort'.
A third argument is that 'green' products may be more popular with
consumers. But manufacturers say they are unsure how much market share they
gain because they tend to improve products at the same time.
These claims for the benefits of green rules are not conclusive enough to
dismiss worries about the damage to European business.
A better response to industrialists' woes, perhaps, is that even if
competition is suffering, the case is easily overstated.
Mr Martin Houldin, environmental director at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick
in London, says: 'I believe the environment is in its infancy as a
competitive factor, whether as a plus or a minus. The international
differences in the cost of labour are generally so much more important that
the environment pales into insignificance.'
Nevertheless, concern about rising environmental costs may have turned the
legislative tide within Europe. Some countries which blithely put their
names to directives a decade ago have begun to cast a beadier eye on new
proposals from Brussels. The Commission's plans for more recycling of
packaging have been scaled down after the ambitious German recycling scheme
plunged into near-bankruptcy. Brussels's most-publicised environmental plan,
a tax on fuel and its carbon content, has also stalled in the light of
widespread opposition.
Moreover, there is growing pressure, particularly from developing countries,
to prevent Europe from wielding protectionist tools to shield itself if it
finds that it cannot afford its social and industrial standards.
The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has brought new heat to that accusation. Some European countries want
to shut out imports from countries that do not share their environmental
standards, but developing countries fear that Europe will abuse these
principles to shut out as much competition as possible.
The Commission has already warned Denmark that its ban on ozone-depleting
substances may have to be modified, and has questioned Dutch plans to
restrict timber imports. Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'We
urgently need to write 'side agreements' into the final version of Gatt to
set out a way of resolving these conflicts.'
That new scrutiny - from inside Europe and beyond - may help Europe tackle
the legacy of two decades of over-enthusiastic rule-making. It may also help
it improve a poor record in designing workable and affordable environmental
rules.

worth reflecting that the US is rapidly cutting loose from its European
roots. The point is not just that Pacific rim and western hemisphere
countries have become more important trading partners, it is that a
diminishing proportion of Americans have personal or ancestral links with
Europe.
Sharp changes in immigration patterns, magnified by differences in fertility
rates, are transforming the US into the world's first truly cosmopolitan
society. Demographic trends point in a direction that would have been
unthinkable to the founding fathers: by the second half of the 21st century,
Europeans and their descendants - the ethnic group that has dominated the US
for more than 200 years - may well be outnumbered by other racial groups.
In parts of the US this non-European future has arrived. Look at the
register of new home buyers in affluent Orange County, suggests Mr Peter
Morrison, a demographer at the Rand Corporation in California. The top four
surnames are Nguyen, Lee, Garcia and Kim. Miami, now jokingly referred to as
the 'capital of Latin America', is comparably diverse. As Time magazine
noted in a special report on 'multicultural' America, nearly 60 per cent of
Dade County residents speak a language other than English at home.
The US was set on its present multicultural path by a radical (but much
underrated) change in immigration policy in the mid-1960s. On humanitarian
grounds, strict limits on overall immigration were eased and rules
allocating quotas according to the existing population mix scrapped, ending
the bias in favour of northern European countries such as Germany, Ireland
and Britain. In 1940, 70 per cent of immigrants came from Europe. By 1992,
over 80 per cent were from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.
Immigration policy was revised three times in the 1980s. The net effect was
to relax entry controls further and reinforce the shift towards Asian and
Hispanic immigrants. Those entering as refugees were mainly Asian while the
beneficiaries of a generous amnesty were mostly Mexicans. The principle
governing legal immigration remains 'family unification'. But since only
recent immigrants seek to bring in family members, and since they are mainly
Asian or Hispanic, the effect is to magnify the new bias in favour of Asia
and Latin America.
So far there seems little risk of an outbreak of European-style xenophobia.
In multicultural America, gangs of skinheads do not amuse themselves by
beating up foreigners. But a nation that is composed of immigrants is
beginning to wonder whether present policies are not excessively liberal. In
the past 10 years, nearly 9m immigrants have entered the US legally - the
largest number since the turn of the century. A further 5m people are
reckoned to have evaded border patrols.
Signs of unease are multiplying. Polls suggest that nearly two-thirds of
voters now favour stricter controls on legal immigration (Americans
overwhelmingly support tougher curbs on illegal aliens). Politicians have
not hesitated to exploit the changing public mood. Mr Pete Wilson, the
Republican governor of California, boosted his popularity last year by
urging the repeal of laws giving automatic citizenship to the children of
illegal immigrants. And he shocked the liberal establishment by arguing that
illegal immigrants should be denied access to the state's over-subscribed
education, health and welfare services.
Some of the growing hostility towards immigrants can be put down to
temporary economic difficulties: when jobs are scarce and local budgets
under pressure, an influx of poor families is bound to be unpopular. The
fact that immigration is so regionally concentrated (in states such as
California, Florida and New York) only adds to the strains. California, in
particular, is inundated, having admitted more immigrants in the past decade
than in the preceding 50 years; 40 per cent of the population of Los Angeles
is foreign born. A third of legal and half of illegal immigrants settle in
the state.
But the fears about immigration run deeper. The underlying problem is that
the decision to loosen immigration policy and shift the mix towards Asians
and Hispanics was not the result of a vigorous public debate. Americans did
not consciously decide their country was under-populated and insufficiently
cosmopolitan. The big changes of recent decades have taken nearly everybody
by surprise.
As a result, the social and financial strains are proving severe.
Highly-educated northern Europeans were easily assimilated. Low- skilled
Hispanics and Asians are not. Yet the federal government does not properly
compensate cities such as Los Angeles for the huge costs of absorbing this
new class of immigrant. And many politicians seem bewildered by social and
educational changes under way - such as strident demands for a genuinely
multicultural curriculum - that are a direct result of their policies.
By global standards US immigration policy is benign. While narrow-minded
Europeans exploit 'guest workers', the US readily offers citizenship. While
the likes of Canada and Australia scoop up the cream of the immigration pool
by imposing strict educational and skill requirements, Uncle Sam remains
big-hearted enough to welcome the underprivileged. It is uplifting to see a
nation settled by Europeans erecting a multicultural tent large enough for
every race and creed. Yet it is troubling that so few Americans seem to
grasp what a bold and principled policy they have embarked upon.

THE Danish government has put up DKr350m (Pounds 36.3m) to rescue the
largest bank on the Faroe Islands, Sjovinnubanken (Fisheries Bank), from
collapse, the second time the Danes have had to help within a few months,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The North Atlantic island group,
population 47,000, is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but enjoys extensive
home rule.
The islands have been plunged into crisis by a combination of high
government spending programmes and a decline in income from fisheries, which
account for 97 per cent of export earnings.
The Danish government propped up the privately-owned Sjovinnubanken with
DKr500m last autumn, on condition that the islands' government sought the
advice of experts from the International Monetary Fund on a policy to
restore the economy.
This week's support for the bank was made conditional on a reduction in the
fisheries fleet, tax changes, and a halt to public investment programmes.
The islands' crisis follows large expansion of the fisheries fleet and
filleting factories in the 1980s, encouraged by direct and indirect
government subsidies, and an ambitious investment programme.
The investments were financed by borrowing heavily abroad, with the result
that the net foreign debt at the end of 1991, at DKr8.1bn, was about
DKr175,000 per inhabitant.

 [Interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by Lothar Ruehl; 
place and date not given: "Russia Has No Right To Have a Say in 
the Baltic States"] 
  [Text] [Ruehl] Mr. Prime Minister, with the expected 
accession of Sweden and Finland to the European Union [EU] in 
1995, West Europe's political and economic organization will be 
expanded to northern Europe and will have a common external 
border with Russia. You have called the Brussels membership 
agreement the most important treaty that Sweden has concluded in 
this century. Why? 
  [Bildt] With the accession of Sweden and Finland the EU will 
adopt a northern European dimension. It would become even 
larger and more fleshed out if Norway were to join the EU as the 
fourth north European country. However, with Sweden and Finland 
the EU will acquire a strong northern part, which will also 
provide it with new strengths. In any case, Sweden will make 
its contribution to that, as soon as the people have approved 
accession, as I confidently expect they will do. 
  Of course, Sweden will fulfill the Maastricht Treaty and 
support the entire construct as a full partner. We will also 
participate in the common foreign and security policy without 
any reservations or deductions. Similar to Finland, my country 
has a special regional importance for northern Europe and the 
Baltic Sea area, which means also for the relationship with the 
three Baltic states and with Russia. Here a new situation will 
develop for Europe. 
  [Ruehl] Some people fear or expect that the expansion of the 
EU might loosen it and will, perhaps, even dissolve the 
political consolidation and the economic ties again. What are 
the Swedish interests? Will Swedish foreign policy move away 
from traditional neutrality to such an extent, as you have 
always indicated, that Sweden can act as a full, active security 
partner also in the case of crises? 
  [Bildt] I do not share such fears about a loosening of the 
EU ties, and I agree with Chancellor Kohl on this matter. Quite 
certainly, Sweden has not decided to join the EU to dissolve it 
or to weaken it. On the contrary. Sweden has always been part 
of the liberal-democratic Europe; Swedish policy has always been 
guided by its values. In the new situation in Europe, which has 
developed since 1990 and which is no longer based on the policy 
of blocs and on confrontation, accession is easier but no less 
important than in the past. Another European prospect has been 
opened up, not only by the Maastricht Treaty on the EU but also 
toward the north and the east, toward those countries in Europe 
which belonged to the Warsaw Pact and to the Soviet Union in the 
past, including Russia. In this larger Europe there lies a 
historic challenge for the expansion of freedom, which must be 
consolidated together. Establishing common security is our 
historic assignment. As an old European state, with its own 
history of empire and its varied international experiences, in 
particular in United Nations peacekeeping, Sweden will 
contribute to that. 
  [Ruehl] What is the particular importance of northern 
Europe, the usefulness of the northern European dimension of the 
EU? 
  [Bildt] Quite clearly the changed geopolitical situation. 
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, especially the 
independence of the Baltic states and of Ukraine, Russia has 
been cut off from direct territorial contact with West Europe, 
in particular since the last Russian troops will withdraw from 
Germany this year. This new reality gives Sweden's accession to 
the EU, with the consequence of West Europe's expansion to 
northern Europe and to the Baltic Sea area, a particular 
significance, because this establishes neighborhood with Russia 
and with the three Baltic countries, which will naturally be 
intensified by Finland's accession into the EU, which we expect. 
A new ensemble is developing in the EU, which will link 
Europe's northeast to the West. However, this does not mean a 
delineation toward Russia but a bridge for coming closer 
together. Northwest Russia is of great importance for Europe, 
politically and culturally as well as economically and in 
scientific-technological terms. 
  [Ruehl] Give us a specific example, please. 
  [Bildt] St. Petersburg as a large city and a region is twice 
as large as Berlin. This area will be a focal area of modern 
development that will radiate to the east, the Baltic, and the 
center of Europe. Russia's ties with West Europe will develop 
anew via the Baltic Sea, with the Baltic states and northern 
Europe. Sweden is located in the center of this area with 
historical ties and experiences toward both sides. Therefore, 
it is important that it participate in formulating the interests 
of the EU in East Europe and in the EU policy toward and 
together with Russia as an EU partner. In the field of 
security, the EU will border in the north on the Western focus 
of Russia's Armed Forces and Navy: the deployment area of the 
North Sea Fleet with missile-armed submarines, whose importance 
as high-sea-capable, globally mobile carriers of nuclear 
deterrence will even grow -- compared with the Soviet past -- as 
a result of the START [Strategic Arms Reduction Talks] agreement 
between the United States and Russia. Therefore, too, it is 
good that Sweden, as a country experienced in dealing with 
Russia and the Russian empire, can exert direct influence within 
the EU on the EU's security policy. 
  [Ruehl] This also appeals to the Western European Union 
[WEU] as the military policy defense pact of West Europe and 
annex of NATO. What is Sweden's attitude toward the WEU and 
toward this prospect? Does this touch upon the issue of 
neutrality? 
  [Bildt] Neutrality, which has existed up to now, will not 
hinder Sweden in this respect, because the preconditions for 
neutrality in Europe have changed fundamentally; this means the 
historical sense and purpose of neutrality have disappeared as a 
result of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 
  We are primarily interested in helping to build democratic 
national defense systems which are oriented toward international 
cooperation, in the former Warsaw Pact states, whose security 
needs are to be covered by NATO's Partnership for Peace. For 
that we can use Sweden's rich experience with our own defense 
system as well as with our participation in UN peacekeeping 
missions. However, the most important thing for Sweden is active 
participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy, 
because this means playing a key role in establishing stability 
and security spread to all of Europe. When Sweden has become an 
EU member, we will decide whether Sweden is to join the WEU or 
whether it is just to have observer status. I think that the 
latter is the more likely option. 
  [Ruehl] What is NATO's importance for European security in 
the future? Should it expand toward the East and could all of 
northern Europe become part of the Atlantic-West European 
alliance system? 
  [Bildt] Not the latter; northern Europe and the Baltic Sea 
area should be reintegrated in an all-European security 
structure, together with the Baltic states, which are also part 
of northern Europe. Of course, the Russian Federation, just as 
well as other European states which belonged to the former USSR 
should also be included in such a security structure. There 
must not be a new delineation along a new dividing line through 
Europe, after the division of the Cold War has now been 
overcome. The EU, too, must find its place in such a security 
structure. NATO has its focus in the West, as a counterweight, 
so to speak, to Russia as the big power in East Europe and on 
the Eurasian continent. 
  NATO remains important for the anchoring of the United 
States 
in Europe and for the defense of West Europe. It essentially 
contributes to all-European security, for instance as a result 
of the U.S. commitment to Norway's security, which, for its 
part, is indispensable for security in all of northern Europe. 
Sweden will develop special relations with the Baltic states to 
strengthen their independence and security and to exert 
influence on them so that they establish special security ties 
with West Europe. The EU as well as the system of Partnership 
for Peace with NATO are suitable for this purpose. 
  [Ruehl] Is the development not moving further into the 
direction of NATO expansion to the east, beyond the "Atlantic 
West Europe" toward Central Europe and beyond Poland and 
Lithuania to the eastern Baltic Sea area? 
  [Bildt] This is correct, as far as Lithuania is concerned in 
the Baltic area. However, the concept of NATO's Partnership for 
Peace is flexible. Flexibility is the most important element of 
the whole thing. It permits various solutions, tailored to the 
specific security situation of the individual partners. 
  In general, one can say that this initiative can, to a 
certain extent, bring about a gradual expansion of NATO in 
Europe. However, the actual function of NATO, its central 
function, lies in the West, in the relationship between North 
America and West Europe in the narrower geographical sense, 
which also includes Norway and Denmark and Germany. In 
addition, the specific situation of the individual countries 
remains the basis of common security. 
  [Ruehl] What does this mean for common security policy? 
  [Bildt] European security policy -- including that of NATO 
and the EU -- must take this diversity into account and, 
therefore, distinguish between the individual countries in the 
spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO cannot 
organize unified security for all of Europe. However, it can 
form a focus and thus be a major part of the foundation of the 
European security structure. 
  As regards the three Baltic countries, they are realistic; 
they know that their acceptance into NATO is not likely in the 
foreseeable future. In the long term, however, everything is 
open. The NATO Partnership for Peace, which they want to enter, 
offers them contact. Sweden will help them, for instance in 
military cooperation with NATO within the framework of the UN 
for international peacekeeping: The "Nordic battalion" of the 
four northern European states in the UN Protection Forces, in 
which Sweden is essentially involved, can serve as an example 
for the establishment of a "Baltic battalion." The northern 
European countries can advise the Baltic states and support 
their military training and organization. Cooperation with NATO 
within the UN framework is necessary and useful, e.g. for 
taking over and applying NATO standards and NATO procedures, 
which have proved their worth at the international level. 
Sweden can participate in this outside the formal NATO 
framework, and the Baltic countries can as well. A pragmatic 
policy permits this without expansion of the NATO alliance 
framework. 
  [Ruehl] What are your expectations regarding the 
development of the security situation in Europe between Russia 
as the superpower in the East, and the Atlantic Alliance and the 
EU in the West? 
  [Bildt] The threat of Soviet imperialism and an aggressive 
ideological power policy has disappeared for good; it will not 
be reestablished regardless of what trends will influence 
Russia's foreign policy in the future and the relationship with 
the outside world. The Soviet empire will not be revived. 
After its loss of the empire and its position as an 
international power, which the Soviet Union mainly held due to 
its military strength and armament, Russia is currently 
unsettled after the secession of large territories in Europe and 
Asia and the independence of the former Soviet republics and the 
ongoing state and economic crisis. 
  [Ruehl] And this unsettled situation does not exactly help 
to stabilize the political situation in the region. 
  [Bildt] Well, this crisis will not be over soon. 
Nevertheless, despite its weakening and the internal confusion, 
Russia remains a major power due to its sheer size, its huge 
population, its natural resources, and its still existing 
industrial-technological potential. It also remains a potential 
international risk factor, yet so far I do not see this 
developing. On the contrary, Russia has so far remained ready to 
cooperate, which can be seen in Russia's policy in the Bosnian 
conflict. 
  [Ruehl] Is the resurgence of nationalism in Russia a danger? 
What do Zhirinovskiy and the new majority in the Duma mean? 
  [Bildt] There is, of course, Russian nationalism, which is 
being strengthened by the crisis and the misery; but this has 
happened in the past too, and is currently also happening in 
other countries. Russian nationalism is even necessary to a 
certain extent. Russia must restore national pride and its 
national identity after the humiliation it suffered as a result 
of the decline of the Soviet Union. Yet this has to take place 
in a democratic system. The nationalist and the old 
national-Bolshevist forces are gathering; this is the 
disquieting aspect of the development; but so far Russia has not 
been overwhelmed by a wave of chauvinism. 
  [Ruehl] But Zhirinovskiy is a political nuisance. 
  [Bildt] No doubt about that. He is a political clown, who 
is making a caricature of Russia, but who is certainly not 
backed by a majority of Russians. The large cities, in 
particular, Moscow and St. Petersburg, neither followed him nor 
the other nationalists and the communists, with whom he entered 
into a kind of "brown-red" front. Many Russians are ashamed of 
Zhirinovskiy's excesses, which tarnish Russia's reputation; they 
think it is a shame that Russia is being disfigured by a 
charlatan. Zhirinovskiy will destroy himself, because he is 
yelling for war, for invading all territories reaching to the 
Indian Ocean, for the borders of the Czarist empire from the 
beginning of the century. 
  [Ruehl] So you do not think that the people will follow his 
slogans? 
  [Bildt] The Russian people will not follow Zhirinovskiy and, 
after its experience in the Afghanistan war, the army will not 
do so either. He is a grotesque phenomenon that will pass by as 
others did before him in the history of Russia. Today, he is 
personifying social protest in a situation of misery and 
national frustration. Yet, it is doubtful that people will 
follow him for a long time. 
  [Ruehl] What is your assessment of Russia's foreign policy 
in general? How should one handle the "near abroad" as a sphere 
of Russian interests? 
  [Bildt] Russian rhetoric about the "near abroad" and a 
"special Russian role" there is incompatible with 
good-neighborly relations and CSCE rules, particularly with the 
Paris Charter for a new Europe of 1990, and the UN Charter. 
Nobody must accept those claims because they mean interfering 
in affairs of other states who have become sovereign and 
independent. There is no "near abroad" that can be politically 
controlled by Russia or any other power in Europe. The Baltics 
are as close to Sweden and Finland as Russia, historically and 
culturally even closer. In Estonia and Latvia there are 
problems of political integration with the Slav part of the 
population, which was transferred there in the Soviet era to 
annihilate the national identity of these small peoples and to 
control these countries from the inside. Yet, this is no reason 
for Russia to claim a right to a say. Russia must not be 
permitted to intervene there or anywhere else. The Russians are 
also wrong when they claim that the "human rights" of the 
Russian minorities would be violated. That is not true: The 
new laws on citizenship are correct as is the treatment of the 
Slav groups of the population. The Council of Europe helped to 
work out these laws. 
  [Ruehl] How should Russia act toward its neighbors? 
  [Bildt] Russia now has a historic chance to find its way 
back to Europe, to which it belongs. A new European order 
requires equal rights and mutual respect. Spheres of interests 
are not compatible with it. Neither is a security condominium 
between Russia and NATO, including joint security guarantees for 
former allies of the old Soviet Union. The litmus test for 
Russia's intentions and its relationship toward Europe is 
Russia's policy toward the Baltic states. This is the criterion 
for European security and cooperation. 
  [Ruehl] Apart from the Baltics there is the question of East 
Europe and the CIS. Ties that developed over a long period were 
suddenly interrupted in 1991. Do you see that as a risk or as a 
chance for a new beginning? 
  [Bildt] Geography, joint history, economic and human ties 
between the peoples of the individual states rather speak for 
careful rapprochement after the separation. It will not be a 
return to the Russian empire or under Moscow's hegemony. Yet, 
Belarus is already looking to Moscow again for guidance. There 
are forces that are working toward voluntary association, but 
there are also tensions that speak against it. The situation in 
Ukraine is extremely critical, particularly since the reformist 
forces do not dominate there, as could be seen in the election. 
The post-Soviet and postimperial era has only just started, and 
many things can still change; the current situation in East 
Europe is one of transition. Rapprochement between Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus, and maybe even Kazakhstan for a great Slav 
confederation appears to be possible. A CIS that is politically 
and economically organized around Russia is one possibility that 
would be geographically and economically plausible and, 
moreover, would be historically founded.

THE inhabitants of the rugged Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic are
getting their first taste of unrationed, over-the-counter alcohol after the
lifting of a Draconian 85-year-old drinks law, Reuter reports from
Copenhagen.
Until this week, each Faroese had to order liquor and wine from Denmark,
subject to individual rationing, and delivery would take place between eight
and 10 days later. Now, with the opening on Monday of the islands' first
liquor, wine and beer store, the waiting is over.
About 1,000 of the islands' 47,000 inhabitants lined up for the inauguration
of the monopoly store in the capital, Torshavn, to experience for the first
time what it is like to buy alcoholic drinks over the counter.
Before the law was lifted, the ration was 12 bottles of liquor from Denmark
every three months. Beer could be bought from local breweries, but had to be
ordered a day in advance.
Politicians on the Faroes, a self-governing Danish province, believe the
change will lead to a more moderate and relaxed drinking culture.
The original law was introduced to combat a serious drinks problem on the
islands, but people effectively circumvented it by ordering their maximum
rations to be on the safe side.

 [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey's Air Attack on Zeli Camp 
in Iraq"] 
  [Text] The ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY has reported that Turkey's 
military aircraft carried out 52 sorties against the Zeli Camp 
in northern Iraq, which is 110 km from the Turkish border. 
According to the news agency, the objective of the air attack 
was to completely destroy the Zeli Camp, in which 1,600 Kurdish 
opponents of the Turkish Government were sheltered. 
  Considering the fact that, in the past, Turkish aircraft had 
hit targets up to 20 km into northern Iraq at most, this was the 
first time they penetrated to bomb positions of the Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK] deep inside northern Iraq. Referring to the 
latest operations against the PKK, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller said: As far as the struggle waged against the PKK is 
concerned, 1994 is an important year. 
  Political observers believe that Ankara has launched a new 
phase in Turkey's operations against the PKK militants. 
Although, similar operations were carried out against the PKK 
in the past, Ankara's move to intensify the Turkish cross-border 
operations indicates that it is mostly worried by the 
developments in northern Iraq. However, several political 
observers are convinced that Ankara is more worried about the 
overt and covert policies of the European countries. They are 
also convinced that the fact that European countries give 
support to the Kurds in Iraq while remaining indifferent to the 
Turkish Government's suppression of the Kurds in Turkey accords 
with the policies of those Western Governments. The same 
observers believe that, considering the fact that the United 
States and the European countries act according to their own 
political interests, the Turkish officials are seeking several 
guarantees from the Western countries. The banning of the PKK's 
activities by the Bonn and Paris governments is regarded as in 
accord with Ankara's wishes. 
  However, the Turkish officials are still believed to be 
worried by the activities of the Kurds, who are opposed to the 
Turkish and Iraqi Governments. Considering this state of 
affairs, several political observers are convinced that the 
Ankara Government's military moves against the Kurds will not be 
successful. Therefore, they believe that political talks will 
be the most effective means of resolving the PKK problem. 
Undoubtedly, the Turkish Government's cross-border operations 
against northern Iraq violate the territorial integrity of Iraq, 
which is an independent country. Furthermore, if such operations 
continue, they may harm security and stability in the region. 
In view of this, the settlement of the problems in the region 
through cooperation among the regional countries without foreign 
interference would promote security in the region.

The two commissioners pointed out that the need for unanimous backing for
subsidy decisions put the Commission in an 'extremely delicate situation',
but it had managed nevertheless to win deep capacity cuts in most cases.
It said parties interested in resolving the steel crisis should resist
putting off decisions until the last minute or risk aggravating a situation
with 'catastrophic economic and social consequences'.
The Commission's steel rescue plan aims to entice steelmakers to close some
30m tonnes of excess crude steel capacity in exchange for European Union
money to help cover at least 50,000 job losses, import restrictions and
other assistance. Italy's refusal to accept demands for capacity cuts at
Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, in exchange for approval of state
aid is the main stumbling block to an overall deal on subsidies.

CARMEN Electronics, the South Korean car radio manufacturer, is to create
257 jobs at a new factory in Northern Ireland.
The company said yesterday that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being
developed by the Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, Co Tyrone, an
unemployment blackspot.
Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be
making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local
recruitment by 1996.
The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of stiff competition
from several other European countries.
Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said the investment would
create significant employment and skills opportunities in the area. He said
Carmen had been attracted to Dungannon partly because of the successful
power-sharing arrangement on the local authority.
Unionist and Nationalist councillors introduced a power-sharing arrangement
several years ago whereby the mayor's post is rotated every six months.
Mr KH Choy, Carmen's president, said the company had decided to locate to
Northern Ireland because the province provided a cost-effective base to
expand into the European Community and develop sales in eastern Europe. 'We
selected Northern Ireland as our European manufacturing centre because it
provides an ideal springboard from which to expand our already substantial
field base throughout the EC,' he said.

 [Interview with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring by 
Veronique Meutey; place and date not given: "Northern Ireland: 
Voting for Peace" -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] The European election which takes place today in 
both Northern Ireland and Britain will be dominated by the 
conflict that has been racking the province for 25 years. 
Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be 
reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP), 
Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and 
John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party 
(SDLP, moderately nationalist). 
  "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If 
we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a 
common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume 
pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious 
differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been 
defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still 
favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the 
slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign 
Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European 
election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a 
potential referendum on Irish reunification. 
  [Meutey] What is at stake in this European election? 
  [Spring] It affords citizens a possibility of participating 
directly in the activities of European institutions. The powers 
of the Parliament have been significantly increased, and today 
it has a real decisionmaking role. As the leader of the Labor 
Party, I am confident. The Socialists will remain the major 
parliamentary group. 
  [Meutey] Has Euroskepticism taken hold in your country? 
  [Spring] No. The Irish are aware of the importance of the 
European Union [EU] and the need to increase its role in the 
years to come. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, polls have 
shown that two-thirds of the Irish are in favor of it. 
  [Meutey] Which foreign policy do you think the EU should 
follow? 
  [Spring] More than ever before, the Europeans must be able 
to 
speak as one and to act together when faced with situations such 
as the Bosnian crisis, the repercussions of the former Soviet 
Union's collapse, and the problems in Northern Africa and the 
Middle East. Implementing the Maastricht Treaty is the only way 
to establish a European foreign policy. 
  [Meutey] How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended? 
  [Spring] Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists 
and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing 
Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge 
these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between 
London and Dublin. 
  [Meutey] Do you favor reunification? 
  [Spring] All we want today is to put an end to the killing 
in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the 
agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to 
retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000 
individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish 
Republic must be respected as well. 
  [Meutey] When would reunification actually happen, then? 
  [Spring] When a majority of Ulster's population has 
expressed a wish to see it happen.... 
  [Meutey] If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when 
would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland? 
  [Spring] Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at 
least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum 
could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a 
year. 
  [Meutey] Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same 
question as in your country? 
  [Spring] Ideally, yes. But we must take into account 
differences between the two countries. There will likely have 
to be two different questions. 
  [Meutey] Will the referendums be held on the same day? 
  [Spring] Same day, same time....

  [Text] Brussels, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), arrived here today on a 
five-day official goodwill visit to Belgium. 
  In a written speech delivered at Brussels airport, Li said 
China and Belgium stand on the two ends of the Asian and 
European Continents and are far off geographically, but Belgium 
is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. 
  He said the Chinese people admire the Belgians for the 
achievements scored in the long-term cause of developing their 
national economy and building their country. 
  Li recalled the cooperative relationship between China and 
Belgium, saying the Sino-Belgian ties have well developed since 
the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971. 
  There have been many exchanges of high-level visits between 
the two sides and the bilateral trade volume has increased 
dozens of times, said the Chinese leader. 
  He noted that there is a new momentum for the two countries 
to promote their cooperation in all fields thanks to the efforts 
of both sides over the past few years. 
  So long as China and Belgium observe the principle of 
seeking 
common ground while reserving differences, and of mutual respect 
for each other, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs and mutual benefit, Li said, the mutually beneficial 
relationship of cooperation between the two countries can be 
developed steadily. 
  This will not only serve the interests of the Chinese and 
Belgian people, but also world peace, stability and development, 
added the Chinese leader. 
  Li will hold extensive talks with Belgian leaders on 
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. 
  He expressed hope that his visit, which came at the 
invitation of the presidents of the Belgian Senate and Chamber 
of Representatives, will further enhance the understanding 
between the two peoples, thus pushing forward the Sino-Belgian 
friendly cooperative relationship in future. 
  Li is on a five-nation European tour which has already taken 
him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LAST PLACES: A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH BY LAWRENCE MILLMAN 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 242 PP.) 




By SONJA BOLLE 




Lawrence Millman recounts his adventures as he traveled the old Viking route 
across the North Atlantic from Norway to Newfoundland. Setting out from Bergen, 
he passed through the Shetland Islands, the Faroes, set in at Iceland, 
Greenland and Labrador, finally arriving in Newfoundland. 


Probably much like the Vikings, Millman strayed from his path whenever he 
sniffed a good story. A whale hunt in the Faroes is too much for him to resist. 
There are the inevitable dangers of primitive travel; On one expedition, 
Millman loses his way in an Icelandic lava field. He includes also the 
descriptions of curious native customs so indispensable to travel writing: In 
an Eskimo village, Millman mortally offends his host by refusing to sleep with 
the hostess. Along the way, Millman collects myths and folktales from the 
people he visits, which, interspersed with his descriptions of land that has 
remained unchanged for eons, lend his narrative a quality of suspension in 
time. 


In addition to tales of traditional life, Millman regales the reader with his 
experiences of modern Nordic life. Recuperating in a Reykjavik Salvation Army 
hostel from a particularly strenuous adventure, Millman finds himself the 
center of a literary controversy during a weekend of heavy drinking. One 
Icelander professes his boozy love for the English language on account of three 
writers -- Shakespeare, Poe and Ray Bradbury -- and immediately begins slurring 
a quote from Henry V: "Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of 
Iceland." This escalates into full-scale warfare when another drinking 
companion defends the honor of the poet Tomas Gudmundsson against all comers. 
In this highly entertaining account, Millman makes the frozen North seem to 
burst with life and color.
