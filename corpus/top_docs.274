FT  28 MAY 94 / Scrabble takeover bid on the board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday made a surprise move
to become the world's undisputed Scrabble champion. It launched a Pounds
46.9m unsolicited bid for JW Spear, the British company which owns rights to
the board game outside North America.
Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout
the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30
per cent of Spear's Pounds 38.7m turnover. This year the company is planning
to introduce versions in Turkish and Hungarian.
Hasbro had sales of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1993. It has owned
Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented more than 50
years ago, since 1989.
It has been the UK company's biggest shareholder outside the Spear family
interests for the past four years, with 26.7 per cent. The trustees of some
Spear family trusts have given undertakings to accept the Hasbro bid in
respect of a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable next
Friday if a higher offer is not received.
Hasbro is offering 900p a share, a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.
The Spear board will meet this morning to consider the bid. The company,
which in March raised its final dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a 22
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 4.51m, is expected to find the offer
inadequate.
Mr Francis Spear, chairman, would make no comment last night, although he
dismissed any idea of a family row. Mr Paul Lipscomb, finance director, said
the bid had come like a bolt from the blue.
Spear's other products include Atmosfear, a board game linked to a video,
and more traditional pastimes such as Snakes and Ladders.
Mr Alan Hassenfeld, chairman of Hasbro, said the acquisition would be 'a
logical extension of Hasbro's strategy to develop and expand its core
operations around the world'.
The origins of Scrabble lie in the 1930s when it was developed as a
crossword game by Alfred Butts, a New York architect whose practice was in
trouble after the Wall Street crash.
It was launched as Scrabble in 1949 after almost two decades of rejection by
leading games players as too highbrow. The game took off in the 1950s after
the chairman of Macy's department store in New York became hooked and placed
a large order.
Mr Butts, a poor speller, earned only a 5 cent royalty on each set.
Nevertheless, at the peak sales levels in the late 1950s and 1960s, he was
getting about Dollars 50,000 a year.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear board split over Pounds 47m bid
from Hasbro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of JW Spear, which owns the rights to the board game Scrabble
outside North America, has been split by the unsolicited offer for the UK
company made by Hasbro, the biggest US toys and games group.
At a board meeting on Saturday, all but one of the Spear directors rejected
the Pounds 46.9m cash offer, which was launched late on Friday.
The exception was Mr Francis Spear, the group's chairman, who said he
thought the terms - worth 900p per share - were fair and reasonable.
In its offer, Hasbro said it intended to encourage Mr Spear to continue to
manage Spear's Enfield, London, manufacturing plant.
The rest of the Spear board, and the company's financial adviser, Barings,
said Hasbro's offer was totally inadequate. The board instructed Barings to
solicit higher offers.
Hasbro is in a strong position, since it already owns a 26.7 per cent stake
in Spear and has received undertakings to accept its offer from some Spear
family trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent.
The undertakings become irrevocable on Friday if a higher offer has not
received.
Barings is approaching other international toy companies which might be
interested in Spear, but the tight timetable makes it doubtful that another
buyer would have time to intervene. It seems most likely that the rest of
the board will try to obtain a higher offer from Hasbro, in exchange for
their recommendation.
Spear is also probably of the greatest value to Hasbro, which since 1989 has
owned Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented.
Hasbro said the acquisition would be a logical extension of its strategy to
develop and expand core operations around the world.
It also seems unlikely that Spear could see off Hasbro by just selling the
Scrabble business to the US group.
Scrabble accounts for 40 per cent of the UK group's sales and one source
said 'the rest of the games portfolio hangs on the back of it.'
Hasbro's offer of 900p a share is a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mattel bids Pounds 52m for Spear - The
scrap over Scrabble gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between America's two leading toy makers moved to the Scrabble
board yesterday after Mattel trumped Hasbro's bid for JW Spear, the word
game's UK maker.
In the corporate finance equivalent of getting all seven letters out on a
triple word score, Spear's advisers solicited a Pounds 52m bid from Mattel
which was launched just five minutes before Thursday night's deadline.
The offer of Pounds 10 a share beats the 900p bid from Hasbro and was
immediately welcomed by Spear's board. However, Action Man maker Hasbro,
which has the rights to Scrabble in North America, is widely expected to
return with a higher offer.
'There must be a pretty good chance,' admitted a member of the Mattel team.
The scrap over Scrabble continues a rivalry which spilled over into the law
courts 18 months ago when Mattel claimed Hasbro's Sindy doll looked too
similar to its own Barbie. Mattel dropped its lawsuit after Hasbro agreed to
give Sindy a facelift.
Hasbro, which has held a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear since 1990, launched
its bid after it received undertakings to accept the offer from Spear family
trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings were to
become irrevocable if a higher offer was not received by midnight on
Thursday. The trusts have little option but to accept the highest bid.
The original bid split Spear's boardroom with Mr Francis Spear, chairman,
saying it was 'fair and reasonable' and the other directors dismissing it as
'totally inadequate'.
Although welcoming the new offer Mr Spear has yet to join the other
directors in advising shareholders that the Mattel offer 'represents a
better prospect for the future development of the business of Spear'.
Mr Spear is close to the Hassenfeld family which founded Hasbro but the rest
of the management are understood to be worried that Spear would disappear
within Hasbro's international games business.
In contrast, Spear would be the first sizeable move into board games for
Mattel, which has previously expressed interest in the area. This made it a
natural target for Barings, Spear's advisers, when searching for a rival
bidder. Mattel finally responded at 5pm and Robert Fleming, its swiftly
appointed merchant bank, launched the bid six hours later.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents 18.4 times Spear's earnings last year.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Waddington passes Monopoly to Hasbro and collects Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday bought Waddington's games division for Pounds 50m in cash,
giving the biggest US toy and games group a monopoly on Monopoly, the
world's best-selling board game.
Mention Monopoly in the UK, and people immediately think of Waddington. But
the archetypal game of capitalists, once banned in the Soviet Union as
ideologically unsound, was invented in the US in the 1930s.
Waddington has always been a printing company, diversifying into games in
the 1920s by printing playing cards. The grandfather of Mr Victor Watson,
who retired as chairman last year, obtained the Monopoly licence for the
British Empire in 1935. The licence was granted by Parker Brothers of the
US, now part of the Hasbro empire. Hasbro itself had a licence to market
Cluedo, owned by Waddington, outside the UK.
Mr Michael Buckley, chief executive of Waddington, said that the sale of the
games division was viewed with some regret, but it was matched by pleasure
at how the group could use the cash. 'The games division is a super company,
but we did not think we could make it any bigger or better.'
The deal will leave Waddington cash positive to the tune of Pounds 13m. It
plans to invest further in both the printing and packaging divisions.
Hasbro was pipped to the post this summer in a battle for Scrabble with
Mattel, its main rival in the US market. Mattel paid Pounds 62m for JW
Spear, the UK company with the rights to Scrabble outside North America.
Hasbro, which owns the North American Scrabble rights, said it felt the
winning price for Spear, at about 21 times earnings, was too high. However,
it is paying about 21 times earnings for the Waddington division, which made
operating profits of Pounds 3.5m on sales of Pounds 25.9m in the year to
April, because of the quality of the portfolio.
Mr Brian Ellis, of Hasbro UK, said the Waddington catalogue had 850 items,
only about 60 of which were games. Monopoly, which sold 300,000 sets in the
UK last year, represented only 15 per cent of the turnover.
'It is much more of a general toy company than a games company,' he said,
citing in particular the Get Set craft products, which are expecting 35 per
cent growth this year.

SCRABBLE FANS FIND GAME A MARRIAGE OF CHALLENGE, DISCIPLINE, MENTAL STIMULATION

Under rows of harsh fluorescent lights, they sit at folding tables, hunched 
over boards covered with small, square tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The room is silent as 10 pairs of players sweat it out in a battle of wits, 
probing their minds for obscure words and letter combinations. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing Scrabble, but this is not exactly the game that many people 
remember playing with their grandmothers over pound cake and iced tea on Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
These are hard-core Scrabble players, many of whom also play chess, who enjoy 
the game for its challenge, discipline and mental stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
And they take their games seriously, memorizing hundreds of obscure words and 
mastering strategies and lingo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock Scrabble Club was started in July by George Heussenstamm, a 
classical composer who teaches music composition and theory at Cal State Los 
Angeles and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 U.S. Clubs 
</P>
<P>
The club, one of more than 300 in the United States, meets from 7 to 10 p.m. 
the second and fourth Wednesday of the month in the Yosemite Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $1 for admission, which covers Heussenstamm's mailings and the 
cookies and coffee provided at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Heussenstamm, a veteran Scrabble aficionado, started the club, there were 
only a handful of players. 
</P>
<P>
Now the group averages 17, and he expects it to grow, following a national 
trend of increasing interest in the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something of an obsession," Heussenstamm said. "It's the kind of thing 
that once you start, it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The club is an eclectic mix of people. At one table, a thin, dark man is 
listening through earphones to a portable tape player, moving his head slightly 
as his eyes flicker back and forth across his tiles. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent is an unemployed Vietnam veteran who is also an avid chess player. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, a 22-year-old physics major from Occidental College is 
battling a heavyset woman who is an administrator with the Los Angeles school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Organized 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble clubs are highly organized and strictly follow a set of Scrabble rules 
promulgated by Scrabble Crossword Game Players Inc., a national organization. 
</P>
<P>
Games are timed using chess clocks, and each player is allowed three minutes 
per move. And the players are serious about their games and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Like chess, Scrabble entails strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Players learn rack management, a method of keeping a balance of vowels and 
consonants. Good players also have to know when to pass their turn, and how to 
work toward bingos -- a move in which all seven letters are used in one turn. 
But the most important strategy is building vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
True Scrabble aficionados fervently study their Official Scrabble Players 
Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
They pore over lists of words, memorizing thousands of two- and three-letter 
words and their possible prefixes and suffixes to help them in their 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the word lists are so obscure that they almost look like random pages 
from a beginning Latin handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble players learn such oddities as "os," meaning orifice; "ta," an 
expression of gratitude, and "ho," an exclamation of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in knowing your words," Heussenstamm said. "You have to build a big 
vocabulary if you want to be good at this game. It involves more than just 
slapping letters on a board." 
</P>
<P>
Someone bellows "challenge" from the far corner of the room, and Heussenstamm 
scurries away to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Heussenstamm started the club in Eagle Rock because he wanted to be able to 
play in a group close to his La Crescenta home. 
</P>
<P>
But as director, he has duties to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
If an even number of players show up, Heussenstamm doesn't play, and he must 
act as referee in the case of disputed words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been somewhat sacrificial for me," Heussenstamm said. "I don't get to 
play much any more." 
</P>

COMPUTAINMENT: DELUXE SCRABBLE SCORES WITH NONTRADITIONALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Virgin Mastertronics' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away 
much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells 
and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch 
their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features. 
</P>
<P>
But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie 
possible only between human players. 
</P>
<P>
In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally 
redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely 
resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer -- 
and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player. 
</P>
<P>
Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual 
tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for 
all levels of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of 
hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but 
impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the 
hide feature doesn't help much either. 
</P>
<P>
We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary 
program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers 
promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty 
1979 paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the 1990 
electronic one. 
</P>
<P>
"Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire 
game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original 
board game and a couple of good friends.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro raises offer for JW Spear by Pounds
2 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the largest US toy and games group, yesterday raised its bid for JW
Spear, the UK company which owns the rights to the Scrabble board game
outside North America.
The US group, which already owns the North American rights for Scrabble as
well as 26.7 per cent of Spear, increased its offer to Pounds 11 a share,
valuing Spear at Pounds 57.3m. It is also offering a loan note alternative.
The new terms are 100p above an offer from Mattel, the rival US toy company,
and 200p ahead of its original offer, made at the end of May.
Mr Norman Walker, a director of Hasbro UK, said the increased offer
represented 'significant enhanced value for shareholders' and reflected
Spear's past performance and future prospects.
Mr Paul Lipscombe, Spear's finance director, said the board would meet next
week 'to consider all aspects of the situation'. The latest offer closes on
August 5. Mattel, whose offer closes on Monday, said it had noted the new
bid and was considering its options.
Hasbro received no acceptances for its original offer, which was launched
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell
their 24.9 per cent stake unless a higher offer was received in three
working days.
The Spear board sought a white knight and found Mattel, which launched its
bid at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming that Mattel's late offer had not
been properly announced; but the judge released the trustees from any
obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro.
The Spear board, which was not recommending either offer, has since allowed
Hasbro to take a more detailed look at the company and its forecasts.
The trustees have given no further undertakings to Hasbro. Hasbro argues
that its offer gives the trusts and families that own a large part of Spear
an opportunity to escape from the limited liquidity of the shares.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Hasbro's
latest offer represents 20 times Spear's earnings last year.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro may raise its 900p a share offer for
JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday did not rule out
raising its bid in the battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns
the rights to the Scrabble board game outside North America.
So far Hasbro, which owns Scrabble in the US and Canada, has received no
acceptances for its 900p a share bid, launched at the end of last month.
Yesterday it extended its offer, which values Spear at Pounds 46.9m, to July
11.
Mattel, the rival US toy group which made a last minute bid for Spear,
yesterday posted its offer document to Spear shareholders, offering Pounds
10 a share in cash or loan notes.
Mr Nigel Hutton of Hasbro UK said the group was still considering all its
options, and would be looking at both the Spear defence document and the
Mattel offer document closely.
The Spear defence document is expected later this week. The board is not
expected to find either offer fair and reasonable, although the higher
Mattel bid will be preferred.
Hasbro, which already owns more than 26 per cent of Spear, launched its bid
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell a
further 24.9 per cent unless a higher offer was received in three working
days.
The Mattel bid was launched at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Last week a High Court judge released the trustees from any obligation to
sell their shares to Hasbro, who had claimed that Mattel's late offer had
not been properly announced.

<LEADPARA>  THE FIRST World Scrabble Championship will be next week in London, with
competitors from 20 countries vying for the $10,000 first prize. It should be
fun to hear or read the news reports about this championship because they are
certain to feature the most obscure, obsolete, and lengthy words played during
the final game.;   Most Scrabble players realize, however, that it is not the
very long words, but the very short words instead that are the keys to victory
in this game. There are 86 two-letter words, for example, that are considered
acceptable for Scrabble play, but many (such as "jo," "li," and "od") are just
as obscure as their sesquipedalian counterparts. (Let's see, that's 1 for the
"s," 2, 3, plus 10 for the "q," plus 1, plus 1, and 3 for the "p" . . . )  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So, if this most-popular word game (27 percent of American homes have at
least one Scrabble set) hinges on words that aren't a common part of any
adult's speaking or writing vocabulary, can it possibly be a good teaching or
learning tool for parents to use with their children?;   THE answer is yes,
but not if it is played the way it is in championships or in most competitions
among adults. The game of Scrabble was designed to put a premium on knowledge
and skill during the course of play. There is a measure of luck involved (as
in the drawing of letters, for example), but Scrabble is a very scary game to
those who feel less than confident in their own vocabulary or spelling
ability.;   And so when children, even teen-age children, are asked to join a
Scrabble game with their parents, they are intimidated by the likelihood that
their comparative ignorance of words and spellings will be exposed during the
play, and they will not only lose, but be embarrassed at the same time.;   One
way to include people of varying abilities in a single game of Scrabble is to
give all players a pencil and note pad, so that they can write down various
words and letter combinations before having to display their selection on the
board. This levels the playing field somewhat by reducing the advantage of
those who can "see" various words in their mind without having to write them
out.;   You can also make a dictionary available for players to use during the
game -- not just for challenges. This practice not only encourages and builds
dictionary skills, but it also helps the entire family become more familiar
with the "family dictionary." (This is yet another reason not to select a
bigger-than-a-breadbox version for your home.);   A THIRD technique for
encouraging "family Scrabble" is to play in teams rather than as individuals.
The weakest and strongest players can be paired as a team (on opposite sides
of the table), and their scores combined. In this way, children can
concentrate on contributing some points, even just a few, at each turn, rather
than being solely responsible for their total score at the end of the game.;  
All three techniques can, of course, be employed at the same time, and other
adaptations are possible as well.;   There are many language benefits that can
come from playing Scrabble, including a knowledge of letter frequencies,
common word endings, and letter combinations. But there are even more benefits
that can come from "family Scrabble," if we will just tune ourselves to our
children's abilities and fears, and adapt this game, like all family games, in
ways that will make everyone eager to participate.  </TEXT>

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear jumps to Pounds 4.51m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear &amp; Sons, maker of Scrabble and other indoor games, is proposing to
lift its full-year dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a substantial
increase in profits for 1993.
The pre-tax figure rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 4.51m.
Earnings per share increased from 47.3p to 56.55p.
The recommended final dividend of 16p (11.5p) lifts the total pay-out for
the year from 14p to 19p.
Turnover increased by nearly Pounds 6m to Pounds 38.7m. The figure contains
Pounds 4.49m from acquisitions, including a contribution from the games
division of Murfett Regency (Australia) acquired last May for Pounds 1.8m
cash. The purchase brought with it the rights to Scrabble in Australia.
Scrabble is made in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30 per
cent of turnover. This year sees the introduction of versions in Turkish and
Hungarian.
Mr Michael Bucher, managing director, said 1993 marked the sixth successive
year of increases in turnover and profits 'in spite of generally poor market
conditions for traditional games in comparison with video and computer
games.'
The company has fought back with the introduction of board games linked to
video cassettes and compact discs. Overall, it has introduced 121 new and
revised items this year.
Last year reduced UK sales were offset by strong growth in France and the
addition of the Benelux countries and the Australian markets.

Mattel yesterday snatched victory from rival US toy group Hasbro in the
battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns the rights to the
Scrabble board game outside North America.
Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, raised its offer for shares in Spear from
Pounds 10 to Pounds 11.50, valuing the company at Pounds 62m. Last Friday,
Hasbro increased its offer from Pounds 9 to Pounds 11.
Spear's directors and family trustees have irrevocably pledged 2,695,000
shares, or 51.2 per cent of the company, to Mattel. Last night, Mr Francis
Spear, chairman said: 'We at Spear are happy with the revised offer. We
believe it reflects a fair and reasonable value for the company.'
Mattel entered the battle for Spear as a white knight after Hasbro launched
a surprise bid in late May. It wanted a more secure foothold in the market
for board games.
Hasbro already owns the North American rights for Scrabble, as well as a
26.7 per cent stake in Spear. The company said last night that it was
considering its position and would be making a statement today. However, it
said it considered Pounds 11 a 'a very full offer'. It appears likely that
Hasbro will now sell its stake.
Hasbro's original offer was made after it received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
Mattel launched its counter attack at five minutes to midnight on the last
day. Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming Mattel's offer had not been
properly announced. But the judge released the trustees from any obligation
to sell their shares.
The Spear board, which was split by the original offer, was not recommending
either bidder. Hasbro raised the stakes last Friday after Spear allowed it
to take a closer look at the company and its forecasts.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents an exit multiple of 21.1 times the company's earnings last
year.
Richard Tomkins in New York adds: Mr John Amerman, Mattel chairman and chief
executive, said he was 'delighted' at the victory. 'This is an excellent
outcome not only for the shareholders but also for Spear's employees and
customers,' he said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judge to rule over Scrabble squabble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge will next Tuesday be asked to decide on the squabble over
Scrabble, the board game which is the main target for two US toy groups
battling for control of JW Spear.
Hasbro, the biggest US toy company and maker of Action Man, is proceeding
against trustees controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group. It will
argue that the trustees are still bound by agreements to sell the stake, in
spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, Hasbro's US rival.
Mattel, maker of Barbie dolls, yesterday noted news of the court case 'with
regret.' The group said its offer of Pounds 10 a share - Pounds 1 above the
Hasbro offer - was made at Spear's invitation.
Hasbro, which launched its Pounds 46.9m unsolicited bid on May 27, has been
the biggest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four years,
with 26.7 per cent. The trustees had given irrevocable undertakings to
accept unless a better offer was made within three business days.
Mattel's offer, valuing Spear at Pounds 52m, was made at just five minutes
to midnight on the final day.
The announcement was lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover
Panel and both sets of advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro claims that this was not a public announcement, and so the
undertakings remain valid.
Mattel has been advised that the announcement of its bid was 'sufficient to
release the trustees from their undertakings to Hasbro.' It understood that
the trustees had received identical advice.
If Hasbro wins on Tuesday, it will be able to declare its offer
unconditional. If it loses it could, under the terms of its original bid,
increase its offer.
The Spear board - apart from Mr Francis Spear, chairman - yesterday
reiterated its description of the Hasbro offer as 'wholly inadequate.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro turns up the heat in scrabble for
Spear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday turned up the heat in its battle for control of JW Spear,
the games group, with a veiled threat of legal action against trustees
controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group.
The US toy maker said the trustees were still bound by agreements to sell
the stake, in spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, the rival toys group.
Hasbro launched its Pounds 9 a share bid for Spear, maker of the word game
Scrabble, 10 days ago, valuing the group at Pounds 47m. The trustees had
agreed to sell their shares to Hasbro, as long as Spear did not publicly
announce an alternative, higher bid in three working days.
On the last day, at just five minutes to midnight, Mattel jumped in with a
Pounds 10 a share offer valuing Spear at Pounds 52m. The announcement was
lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover Panel and both sets of
advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro now claims this was not a public announcement and so the undertakings
are valid. 'All the steps were taken of getting ready to make a public
announcement, but no public announcement was ever made,' said Mr Francis
Jackson of J Henry Schroder Wagg, its advisers and merchant bank.
Hasbro said it was considering its options regarding legal action if the
trustees did not adhere to the undertakings. No response had yet been
received from the trustees.
Spear rejected Hasbro's claim and said it had received professional advice
that the Mattel offer had been validly announced. The board, with the
exception of Mr Francis Spear, the chairman, was recommending Mattel's
offer. Mr Spear originally backed Hasbro's offer, but has been silent since
the Mattel bid.
The regulatory authorities appear to be divided on the issue raised by
Hasbro. Under Stock Exchange guidelines, a public announcement is made by
notifying the Stock Exchange and at least two national newspapers and two
news wires.
However, Spear's advisers, the merchant bank Barings, are understood to have
consulted the Takeover Panel on their interpretation of a public
announcement. While the Panel would not comment on the contract signed by
the trustees, it is believed to have defined a public announcement as
notification to itself, the Stock Exchange, the company, Hasbro and both
sets of advisers.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of JW Spear, the maker of the 'Scrabble' board game,
was thrown open again yesterday when a High Court judge released the
company's trustees from any obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro, the
US toy group.
The judge ruled that Mattel, a rival US toy company, had acted properly in
announcing an improved offer five minutes before the deadline for the
operation of a clause allowing the trustees to be released from an
irrevocable undertaking to sell a controlling interest to Hasbro.
The court's decision now leaves the Spear trustees - who own 24.9 per cent
of the company - free to accept the Mattel bid or any higher one.
Hasbro was last night considering its options: to mount an appeal against
the ruling, out-bid Mattel, or walk away. The company is certain to reach
its decision before Thursday, after which an undertaking given yesterday by
the trustees not to sell their shares to anyone else will expire.
The dispute arose after the Spear trustees gave irrevocable undertakings on
May 27 to accept a Pounds 46.9m bid from Hasbro which, with 26.7 per cent,
has been the largest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four
years. However, Mattel responded with a Pounds 52m bid. This was announced
at five minutes to midnight on June 2, the final day when the escape clause
applied to allow the trustees to accept higher bids.
The legal action centred on whether Mattel had fulfilled its obligations to
make a public announcement of its offer. Mattel had informed the Stock
Exchange and the Takeover Panel in the minutes leading up to the final
deadline, but not the national press.
Lawyers for Hasbro argued that the offer should also have been announced to
at least two national newspapers and two UK wire services.
Giving judgment, Mr Justice Chadwick said that when the escape clause was
agreed between Hasbro and the trustees, it was likely that their intention
was to guarantee the commitment of third-party bidders rather than informing
the investing public.
Spear, its trustees and Mattel welcomed yesterday's outcome.

<LP>
   The first-ever World Scrabble Championship begins tomorrow
in London, and leading the U.S. delegation will be a
35-year-old who won a tense victory at the biggest U.S.
tournament in Cincinnati last month. He happens to be my
older brother, Charles.
   Chuck has come a long way. He had seemed normal as a
toddler -- at least to our parents -- but our father got an
inkling of what was in store when he asked five-year-old
Chuck how he did on a test. Laconic even then, Chuck replied:
"Let's see. Four columns. Sixteen rows. Sixty-four questions.
Missed one. Got 63 out of 64 right." By first grade, he was
helping our babysitter with her algebra. By third grade, he
was doing our father's budgets for his part of Westinghouse's
public-relations operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In high school outside Pittsburgh and in college at
Carnegie Mellon, Chuck earned full credentials as a math nerd
and computer weenie, but the game of bridge had become his
passion. He, a partner and two innocent bystanders once drove
two hours to a dog track, and the two partners discussed a
single bridge hand the entire trip. After betting for four
hours, Chuck and his partner resumed in mid-sentence and
discussed the same hand the whole way back. Chuck became a
Life Master, bridge's highest rank, at age 20 and finished
second in a national event. Then, in his mid-20s, he became
bored and dropped the game cold.
   Rubik's Cube fascinated him briefly. During a lull as he
and I toured New York some 10 years ago, I noticed he was
scribbling strings of numbers and letters on a scrap of
paper. I finally figured out that he was trying to
mathematically work through the cube's permutations.
   Chuck soon moved on to gambling, quitting his job as a
computer programmer to move to Las Vegas for four months. He
made money counting cards at blackjack and lightening the
wallets of the drunk tourists at the poker table. But he lost
much of the money by experimenting with systems for betting
on sports.
   The interest in gambling ended abruptly, too, and Chuck,
by now a manager for a computer company in Minneapolis, took
up Scrabble. His assault on the game began with some
simple-enough pointers: 1) Learn the 86 two-letter words
because they let you connect to existing words; 2) Pay more
attention to what's on the board than what tiles are in your
rack; 3) Worry about what tiles you're stuck with after you
play a word. But most of his approach falls into the
don't-try-this-at-home-kids-because-this-is-for-
professionals-realm.
   Among other things, he has used a computer to generate
lists of words that include seven of the letters he is most
likely to find on his rack, plus one more letter. Chuck
drills himself on those words to keep them fresh in his mind.
He plays Scrabble six hours or so a week and studies for more
than an hour a day. The image that endures of him is of the
dutiful father strolling around his living room carrying a
screaming infant in a Snugli and studying his flashcards. At
his first nationals, in 1988, Chuck finished 16th. "Lucky,"
he said. The next year, he slipped to 19th. "Unlucky," he
explained. Last year, in his third try, he finished eighth
and had clearly become a force in the game. When a friend of
our father's went to a tournament and asked a player to point
him toward Chuck, he got the sort of stunned silence he would
have expected if he had wandered into a Little Italy social
club and asked to see John Gotti.
   This August, against the toughest field assembled in
years, Chuck was on a roll. Although the tournament didn't
carry the imprimatur of Milton Bradley, Scrabble's owner, it
did include all the big names, such as Robert Felt, the
reigning official champ because he won the 1990 national
tournament.
   In one game, Chuck's first three plays were "bronzier,"
"oracular" and "notturni," giving him three 50-point bonuses
for playing all seven letters in his rack. The score at that
point was 215 to 26. In another game, Chuck's opponent got
50-point bonuses -- known as "bingos" -- on his first two
turns but found himself trailing Chuck by 190 points. Chuck
had scored a career-high 212 points on one word, "landform,"
which hit two triple-word scores. Other games produced the
words "zoeae," "codeia," "tirrivee," "duvetyn," "beigy" and
"qaids" (the latter, which according to the Official Scrabble
Player's Dictionary means "Far Eastern rulers," turns out to
be one of the most common plays in high-level Scrabble).
   Nobody much watched the tournament, with its 160
contestants huddled over their boards for 20 hours over 4 1/2
days in the ballroom of a Cincinnati hotel. "Too boring,"
Chuck said. But there was plenty of tension going into the
final day's play, as Chuck's 18-6 record tied him with three
others for first. He was ahead on the tiebreaker, the spread
between the points he had scored and the total his opponents
had scored, but he also was worried. He had to start off
against Peter Morris, a former champion who Chuck describes
as "the smartest person who plays Scrabble."
   Chuck played "yclepe," which was a "phony," or fake word,
that looked like two Old English words. But Morris is a
graduate student specializing in Victorian literature and
caught it right away. Chuck lost big after Morris challenged.
When Chuck and Morris both won their next games, they were
pitted against each other in the final game. Chuck not only
had to win, he had to win by 143 points to have the better
spread. "A hundred-to-one shot," Chuck said.
   But Chuck got both blanks in the final game and played
four bingos, including "klavern," a Ku Klux Klan cell. Things
got tight when Chuck drew the "q" right at the end with
nowhere to play it, especially because Chuck describes Morris
as "the best end-game player in the history of the world."
Still, Chuck won by 152 points.
   Chuck collected his check for $3,900 and celebrated by
taking the bus to Pittsburgh. He used the time to study
words. It's a good thing, since players at the world
championship will be able to use words from all official
English-language Scrabble dictionaries, so Chuck had 20,000
words to learn by this week.

How many bona fide two-letter words are there in English? Anyone knowing the
answer off pat will probably be an addict of Scrabble (in which short words
can be decisive in end-play) and so have cause to lament the death of the
game's US inventor Alfred Butts.
As old as the century and an architect by training, he devised the
word-based board game in the 1930s only to have it turned down by
manufacturers in the field. It was not until the early 1950s that the Macy's
retail chain began selling Scrabble, paving the way for an estimated total
sale in various languages which still seems low at 100m. He said he earned
only a few cents on each.
As for the two-letter words, according to Chambers English Dictionary, the
number is 106. The three-letter variety are far more plentiful, with 1,087.

FT  13 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Hasbro gives up on Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th July 1994) appended to this article.
Hasbro yesterday threw in its hand in the battle for JW Spear, the maker of
Scrabble, and said it would accept the Pounds 11.50 a share bid from US toy
rival Mattel.
It described the Pounds 62m offer as 'very generous and above a level which
we could justify in business terms'.
The decision ends a fierce scrap over Spear, which started when Hasbro
launched a 900p a share bid for the company at the end of May. It had held a
26.7 per cent stake since 1990 and had received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
After a frantic search for a white knight, Hambro, Spear's merchant bank,
persuaded Mattel to launch a rival bid at Pounds 10 a share five minutes
before the deadline. Hasbro came back with an Pounds 11 a share offer last
Friday, which was topped by Mattel on Monday night.
Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International, said: 'Our offer at
Pounds 11 per share was a very full one which we are not prepared to
increase. We are very pleased at the outcome for all shareholders and will
of course realise a substantial gain on our own investment which we made in
1990.' Hasbro bought its original stake at under Pounds 3 a share.
The outcome leaves the rights to Scrabble divided between Mattel and Hasbro,
which are fierce rivals in the doll market. Hasbro, maker of Sindy, retains
the rights to Scrabble in North America, leaving Barbie's creator, Mattel,
with the rest of the world.
Mattel's victory is particularly sweet for Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank. It was appointed by Mattel just six hours before the initial offer had
to be launched and completed the task with a few minutes to spare.
CORRECTION
JW Spear's merchant bank, which handled its successful sale to Mattel,
was Barings not Hambros as stated yesterday.

<MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The whole thing came to -- let's see -- 40 words. Cost me 30 bucks. Then I
went home and waited for the responses to roll in. Nothing. Zero. It was
unbelievable.;    Every day I'd stand out by the mailbox waiting for a
postcard from some hot-looking babe who wanted a shot at an advanced Scrabble
player. And every day Ted, my postman, would walk by and shake his head and
sing out: "Nothing for you today, Occupant!";    Finally, after a month or so
of no responses, I threw my hands in the air and shouted: "That's it! I'm
quitting the dating scene! I don't know what these women want anymore!";    A
buddy of mine, Neil, happened to be over the day I went ballistic. He asked to
see my personal ad and studied it for several minutes.;    "You gotta punch it
up a little bit," he said finally. "There must be something you like to do
besides play Scrabble.";    Not really, I said. For a while there, I was
hooked on Sorry. And before that I'd play a lot of Hungry, Hungry Hippo, which
is a game my 4-year-old niece turned me onto where you try to capture marbles
in a plastic cup shaped like a hippopotamus.;    But lately, I said, it's been
mostly Scrabble. Not to brag or anything, but I should point out . . .;   
"Listen," Neil said, "lose that Scrabble stuff. Put something in the ad like:
'Has won over 25 bowling trophies.' They'll be beating down the doors to go
out with you.";    Neil knows women, you've got to give him that. But I needed
a second opinion, which is the reason I showed the ad to Sarah Jean down at
the Laundromat.;    Sarah Jean was pretty busy making change; all 24 washers
and dryers were humming and she was cranking the quarters off the changer on
her belt so fast you could barely see her fingers.;    But finally she stopped
saying, "How much you need, Sugar?" and took a minute to look at my ad.;   
From the expression on her face, she didn't like what she was seeing -- unless
it was the No. 9 dryer knocking with those tennis shoes that was bothering
her.;    "Part of the problem," she said between drags on a Salem, "is your
opening sentence, especially that 'short, unattractive man with thick glasses'
business. A lot of women don't go for that type of guy.";    Man, I could have
kicked myself. She was right, of course. The more I thought about it, you
don't see too many Meg Ryan types with ugly, stumpy guys with Coke-bottle
glasses -- Scrabble background or no Scrabble background.;    Why I didn't
think of that in the first place is beyond me. Just stupid, I guess. Yeah,
that's it. Maybe the ad should have read: "Short, stupid, unattractive man
with thick glasses seeks . . .";    "Another thing," said Sarah Jean, "you
can't just say you're looking for someone to cook and pay for your car and
have sex with. That's going to turn women off. It's too -- honest.";    Well.
This was a fine how-do-you-do. Here the folks at the magazine were saying: "Be
truthful." But Sarah Jean was saying: "Sugar, to play this game, you gotta lie
like a rug.";    Anyway, once the morning rush was over, Sarah Jean and I sat
down and wrote out a new personal ad on the back of an empty box of Tide.;   
Actually, she dictated and I wrote with a big red Magic Marker that Earl,
Sarah Jean's boss, uses to make up "This Dryer Out of Order" signs.;    "Tall,
rugged-looking Harvard grad seeks attractive, non-argumentative, financially
well-off woman for quiet candlelight dinners (your place), help with
philanthropic causes, erotic adventure (though on a limited basis.) Must have
sense of humor. Proficiency at spelling and board games preferred.";    I
don't know -- it doesn't really sound like my kind of personal. Plus I had to
pony up another 30 bucks to get it into the magazine.;    Sarah Jean, she can
get a little wordy.  </TEXT>

Coleco Industries agreed Thursday to be bought by Hasbro Inc. for $85 million, 
marking the likely end of the company that made the hottest-selling toy in U.S. 
history, the Cabbage Patch Kids doll. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro, the largest American toy maker, will receive all of Coleco's product 
line, which includes Scrabble and Parcheesi board games, as part of the 
all-cash deal, Coleco Chairman Morton Handel said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal still must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where 
Coleco, swamped with $540.3 million in debt, sought protection from creditors a 
year ago. A hearing on the sale is expected next week or in early July, Handel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro stock as 
part of the deal. Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., will get inventory, 
equipment to make products and some accounts receivable. 
</P>
<P>
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and Coleco directors 
also must approve the deal, which must be completed by July 17. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's 250 employees are expected to be laid 
off, although some may be hired by Hasbro, Handel said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco has about 75 salaried workers in Avon, Conn., 75 in Mayfield, N.Y., and 
a total of about 100 assembly-line workers at both locations. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take risks," said Paul 
Valentine, a toy analyst with Standard &amp; Poors in New York. "The industry 
is poorer because of their demise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good, Stable Games' 
</P>
<P>
Russian immigrant Maurice Greenberg founded the Connecticut Leather Co. in 
1932. The firm company expanded its leather and shoe products line to toys in 
1954 and its name was changed to Coleco in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Coleco ran into trouble after the phenomenal success of the 
Cabbage Patch doll, which became the best-selling toy of all time with more 
than $600 million in sales in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
David Leibowitz, senior vice president of American Securities Corp., said 
Coleco borrowed money to expand after the success of the Cabbage Patch dolls. 
</P>
<P>
But when Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products, including Adams 
home computer and toys based on the Rambo movies, did not sell, Coleco couldn't 
pay off the new debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and Transformers, 
had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from $104.3 million in 1980. Hasbro in 
the last decade has bought big-name companies, including Milton Bradley Co., 
and introduced a steady stream of new products. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro Executive Vice President Barry Alperin said of the Coleco deal: "It 
means the acquisition of good, stable game products, like Scrabble, Parcheesi 
and Aggravation . . . and it's a good chance to add to our toy division." 
</P>
<P>
After the transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million in cash, $85 
million from Hasbro and about $65 million it had in banks in mid-March, Handel 
said. The cash will be used to pay off the company's debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco also said it would retain some real estate assets, which will be 
converted to cash.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear, the Enfield-based toys and games manufacturer, reported sharply
reduced losses in its seasonally unfavourable first half.
Losses before tax were Pounds 315,000 for the six months to June 30, down
from Pounds 638,000 at the same stage of 1991. The group, famed for its
Scrabble game, achieved profits of Pounds 2.53m pre-tax in the full 1991
year.
The outcome reflected lower interest payable of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds
125,000). Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 8.28m as France proved a
'lacklustre' market following the impact of video games, said Mr Francis
Spear, chairman.
Losses per share were cut to 5.78p (8.19p) and the interim dividend goes up
to 2.5p (2p).

Who will finally bag J W Spear, the UK owner of Scrabble? Will it be mighty
Mattel, manufacturer of Barbie, aged 35? Or will Hasbro, handler of Sindy,
33, finally win through? Hasbro was first, valuing Spear at almost Pounds
47m, but Mattel squeezed in last Friday, valuing it at Pounds 52m.
Observer understands the matter has already passed into the hands of two top
executives, charged with thrashing out a compromise. Here's an excerpt of a
crucial weekend phone call.
S: Whaddya mean by this, tryin' to upstage ma show? Old man Spear has
already said he's happy with us.
B: Off your high horse, gal. All's fair in love, war and business. The other
Scrabble guys go for me.
S: Cheapskate] Flashing your legs ain't gonna make no difference.
B: At least I got legs worth flashing - punters paid more than Dollars 1bn
for me last year. And I got 55 per cent of the fashion doll market. You only
got 32 per cent, honey.
S: You ain't got a decent pedigree, sweetie pie. Ah'm British, through and
through.
B: British? Don't crease me up. You ain't been British since 1986.
S: I jest know that Spear likes my looks better than yours.
B: Butt out, kiddo - your looks were a damn sight better before you got a
nose job in '92.
S: That was only 'cos you bitched so loudly that I was better-looking than
you.
B: Lighten up, loser. You ain't gotta hope in hell.
S: (Sounds of sniffles).

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Barbie and Sindy v Ken and Eddie - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As double acts go, Barbie and Sindy may be less edifying than Ken and Eddie,
but more electrifying to investors. A rally of the dolls is underway with
their respective parents, Mattel and Hasbro, battling each other for control
of JW Spear &amp; Sons, the British toy maker. Spear's stock is already up 58
per cent from its January low to 750p with every last Scrabble tile still to
fight for.
But is the stock market's uplift this week - achieved without assistance
from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke or Governor Eddy George - anything more than
a cosmetic correction?
After the dreadful drubbing stocks and bonds suffered the previous week, the
tide turned on Thursday in the futures markets. The cash markets too saw
some genuine buyers attracted by near 9 per cent long gilt yields and 4 per
cent dividend yields.
The upturn proved fragile yesterday. No sooner did the latest US payroll
figures hit screens at lunchtime, than stocks and bonds headed south again.
Only when US bonds rebounded on some comforting words from the White House
did UK markets recover their poise. The FT-SE 100 index finished with a 31.4
point gain on the week at 2,997.8.
Few investors doubt there is genuine value in equities and gilts at these
levels but none are in a hurry to buy. 'We feel slightly spoiled for
choice,' says David Manning, director of UK equities at Legal &amp; General, a
large institutional investor. But there is no need to rush to invest in
either market. 'They will still be here in two or three months' time at the
same sort of levels.'
One factor holding him back is the high yield on index linked gilts. Not
only is the 4 per cent return virtually the same as the stock market's
average dividend yield but it is also risk-free.
As the first of the accompanying charts show, the index linked yield is high
by historic standards apart from the period 1990-92 when it was boosted by
sterling's membership of the ERM. It is hard to envisage yields rising much
further. But even if the bond market fails to rally and achieves only
stability, equities could still gradually recover.
'If indexed linked yields do stabilise and one looks out through 1994 and
1995 one can see an equity yield premium re-emerging fairly rapidly,' say
strategists at SG Warburg Securities, thanks to rapid dividend growth.
As the second chart shows, the dividend yield has rarely been so close to
the index linked gilt yield apart from the run up to the 1987 crash. At
current levels, equities are expensive but will become more attractive as
dividends grow and the yield ratio rises.
Such a modest stock market improvement later this year, led by expanding
earnings and dividends, seems much more likely than one led by a bond market
rally and falling interest rates. Even though a long gilt yield of around 9
per cent is discounting more inflation than most people expect, there are
too many economic uncertainties at home and abroad for investors to chase
bond prices higher.
A parallel can be drawn with the market in mid-1985, says Vivian Bazalgette,
managing director of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. 'This is a mid-cycle
reaction when the market is switching from being interest rate to earnings
driven. We see scope for the market to rise to its former peak or even a
little higher by the end of the year.' Gartmore has remained slightly
overweight in UK equities throughout the market's 15 per cent correction
from its February peak.
Most other UK institutional investors are also well represented in domestic
equities so they may not be a source of particularly heavy buying when the
market begins to recover. However, there are stocks to cherry pick. Legal
and General, for example, likes those big international stocks in the
Footsie which offer above average dividend yield and exposure to the US
economy.
No companies reporting this week fit the profile although Siebe fails only
on the dividend count. The controls maker reported a 20 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to Pounds 217.2m and an 11.6 per cent increase
in full-year dividend to 11p for a gross yield of 2.4 per cent. Its
underlying profit margins held up through the recession and it is now
enjoying some growth in demand in the Americas and elsewhere.
The most pleasant results surprise came from Boots. Reporting pre-tax
profits for the year up 19 per cent to Pounds 484.4m and the dividend up 12
per cent to 15p, it shook off some of the investor doubts which have dogged
it for the past 18 months. It has yet to work out what to do with its
struggling drugs business or to show it can make money in the do-it-yourself
sector, but there is no doubting the strength of its core retailing
business.
In contrast, elsewhere in the retail sector, Kingfisher delivered a rather
downbeat annual general meeting statement. First quarter sales volume was
lower than a year earlier and its 'every day low-pricing' policy is still
not paying off convincingly. Its shares lost more ground and are now down 33
per cent from their high for the year of 778p.
Granada Group offered the most sparkling performance of the week. Its
interim pre-tax profits were up 51 per cent to Pounds 103m and its dividend
up 10 per cent at 3.33p. Acquisitions in catering and textile rental were
big contributors while LWT, the television franchise, chipped in only
one-month so far.
Although Granada's results attest in part to the profitable audience for
glamorous game shows, Barbie and Sindy are fighting on a higher intellectual
plane. Not for them the fripperies of outfits, accessories and hairstyle
they normally crave. This time they are each after Spear's Scrabble
franchise. Sadly, there would be little contest if they challenged Ken and
Eddie to a game.

   Fourteen-year-old Adam Logan says he doesn't
remember when he first learned to play Scrabble or how he got so
good at it.
   ``I just know that it's fun,'' he said during a break after
Sunday's first game of the 1989 National Scrabble Championship.
   Logan, a high school student from Ottawa, is the youngest of the
151 expert players competing in a five-day tournament for the
$5,000 top prize. Another 72 recreation-level players also are
competing at the New York Penta hotel in midtown Manhattan.
   The competitors are from 30 states and eight other countries.
   The 1987 champion, Rita Norr of New York City, is the only woman
to win the 7-year-old tournament.
   ``Some people feel that the women don't have the killer
instinct,'' she said. ``I'm not sure that that's really it. Men
maybe have the freedom to concentrate more on the game.''
   Norr, a freelance mathematics textbook writer with a computer
science background, said the game is more than knowledge of words.
   ``It's very mathematical,'' she said. ``A lot of it's even
spatial relationships and decisions about when to challenge, when
not to challenge, when to close the board, when to open it,
constantly keeping track of where you are in the game and how many
tiles are left.''
   But Loera Thompson, a 75-year-old Mississippi native, doesn't
take it so seriously.
   ``I don't care that much about it,'' she said _ as long as she
isn't outpointed. ``I like to win, of course.''

   He's been laughed at for using Jimminy
Cricket's droppings for fertilizer, but Bill Bricker gets the last
laugh when he hoists his three-pound tomatoes to promote his
Kricket Krap.
   The retired Army colonel invents organic fertilizers like
Kricket Krap, which he sells from his 10-acre farm along the
Savannah River near Augusta.
   ``It's what the name says _ cricket droppings,'' Bricker said.
``I don't know why people never thought of it before. Crickets eat
25 percent protein _ that's better than you or I eat.''
   Once a month, Bricker buys about six tons of droppings from two
local cricket farms, where the insects are raised as bait and their
droppings collected with a huge vacuum cleaner.
   He bags the droppings and sells them around the country via his
mail order service.
   Bricker said he also wants to educate the South about the values
of organic farming. But it's also a million-dollar business, and he
goes to great lengths for a sale.
   His first fertilizer was a combination of leaves, hay and old
vegetables baked in the sun. When it sold poorly, he televised an
ad that showed an egg cooking in a plastic bag in the middle of the
compost pile.
   Then, he ate the egg.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Survey of Home Entertainment (6): Monopoly is still leading
the field - Non-Electronic Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PURVEYORS of Britain's board games must have blanched at the news of fights
breaking out among several thousand youngsters locked out of a computer
games exhibition in London earlier this month.
It is not the sort of thing that happens in the staid world of
non-electronic games, where Monopoly (circa 1930) remains the number one
seller, followed by old rivals Cluedo (circa 1950), Scrabble and the newer
Trivial Pursuit.
'The traditional board games offer a good value way of bridging the
generation gap and in which all the family can participate,' says Mr Alan
Thompson, managing director of Waddington Games, makers of Monopoly.
'Computer games are usually designed for single players.'
However, the new wave of electronic entertainment has dented the growth in
board game sales, although they have held up well in the face of the
recession.
Last year, board game sales grew to Pounds 127m from Pounds 114m in 1988,
with Monopoly selling 300,000 units - and Junior Monopoly an additional
200,000.
New growth areas are generally limited to one-off blockbusters such as
Trivial Pursuit, or adaptations from television game shows. Hence healthy
sales are expected this Christmas for the likes of 'Big Break', 'Give us a
Clue' and 'TV Addicts'. Toy executives maintain close contacts with
television companies, producing a two-way stream of games linked to TV and
vice versa.
Meanwhile, Subbuteo, the table football game, has seen a seven-fold increase
in sales in the past six years, mirroring renewed interest in the domestic
game. There has also been a flood of games on the 'Dungeons and Dragons'
theme.
However, a stroll down the aisle of any large toy store reveals hundreds of
board games lacking either the pull of television support or the staying
power of the established giants. One cannot help but fear a short shelf life
for the likes of 'Mall Madness' and 'Beware the Bog]'.
The cost of introducing new games is high, with its success dependent on
good distribution. Periphery players also struggle because with two-thirds
of sales made in the Christmas period, large amounts of stock have to be
held throughout the year. 'I think the industry will become centred around
fewer players,' says Mr Thompson. Experienced toy industry watchers predict
a New Year fall-out for some of the smaller manufacturers.
One of the few new companies to make in-roads into the UK market is the
Japanese group Tomy, which in the past 10 years has seen its sales grow from
zero to Pounds 60m.
With no traditional board game as a backbone, Tomy has concentrated on
developing activity games with an emphasis on skill and dexterity. 'There's
nothing more boring than a flat piece of cardboard,' says Mr Peter Brown,
managing director of Tomy UK. 'People, and especially children, want
something extra to do while they're playing.'
But despite Tomy's efforts to widen the market, the search for the lucrative
'new Monopoly' continues to exercise not only some of the great minds of the
toy world, but also the British public.
Mr Brown says he receives up to a dozen suggestions a week from the public
for new board games. At Waddingtons the number of suggestions regularly runs
to a hundred. In the meantime, Monopoly looks likely to live up to its title
and maintain its dominant position.

   Chieftain Products Inc. said it is suing West Hartford, Conn.-based Coleco Industries Inc. in the Supreme Court of Ontario for alleged violation of a contractual agreement to market Scrabble and other game products in Canada. 

   Chieftain, based in Downsview, Ontario, said it seeks an injunction to prevent Coleco's Coleco (Canada) Ltd. unit from selling Scrabble in Canada, beginning in April. 
Chieftain has been selling Scrabble in Canada since 1980, and claims that it signed an agreement with Coleco in 1986 that provided for extension of the marketing arrangement beyond April. 

   A spokesman for Coleco said that a letter of intent to extend the original agreement was signed in September 1986, but that the letter was subject to a full agreement, which Coleco says never took place. 
The spokesman further said that Coleco informed Chieftain in December 1986 that Coleco intended to market Scrabble on its own. 
Coleco "will vigorously contest" the suit, the spokesman said. 

   Closely held Chieftain is seeking $15 million in damages related to the alleged breach of contract.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: JW Spear shows 46% improvement to Pounds
3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JW SPEAR, the maker of Scrabble and other games, yesterday announced profits
up by more than 46 per cent to Pounds 3.71m for the year to December 31,
compared with Pounds 2.53m.
The group switched pension fund managers from Scottish Amicable to Scottish
Widows at the beginning of 1992 following 'lacklustre performance', Mr Paul
Lipscombe, finance director, said.
Last July the routine actuarial revaluation had revealed a further charge to
the profit and loss reserve bringing the total to about Pounds 700,000 over
the last two years.
The charge was partly due to a shortfall between the fund's performance and
its projected liabilities.
The advance in profits came on turnover up 20 per cent, from Pounds 27.3m to
Pounds 32.8m.
Margins improved to more than 12 per cent (10.5 per cent).
Distribution costs rose some 40 per cent to Pounds 9.77m against Pounds
7.99m for the preceding year, mainly because of royalties paid under a
licensing arrangement for Atmosfear, the interactive video game.
A proposed final dividend of 11.5p (8p) brings the total distribution for
the year to 14p (10p) payable from earnings per share ahead from 32.3p to
47.3p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: J W Spear search for white knight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to Scrabble maker J W Spear were last night still searching for a
white knight to top the Pounds 47m bid for the company from US toy giant
Hasbro.
But it looked increasingly unlikely that their efforts would be successful
ahead of this morning's deadline when acceptances from Spear family trusts
owning 24.9 per cent of the shares become irrevocable.
Hasbro already has a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear acquired four years ago.
Barings has asked the Spear trustees to forward a letter to the
beneficiaries which questions why the bid should be accepted, given that all
the Spear board, barring the chairman Francis Spear, believe it is
inadequate.

<TEXT>
   Toy company Hasbro Inc. on Thursday said
better profit margins and improved performances by its Milton
Bradley and Playskool units helped third-quarter earnings rise 73
percent.
   The company reported earnings of $31.3 million, or 53 cents per
share, compared with $18.08 million, or 31 cents a share, in 1988's
third quarter. Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $403 million in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 from $368.4 million a year earlier.
   ``As anticipated, our third quarter gross profit margin improved
from that of the second quarter,'' said Alan G. Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive.
   Along with better revenue by Milton Bradley and Playskool, which
concentrates on toys for infants and young children, international
operations showed improvement, despite being hurt by a strong
dollar, Hassenfeld said.
   Analysts had said the Milton Bradley unit's board games could
take a beating from video games.
   Hasbro recently bought many of the products formerly
manufactured by Coleco Industries Inc., including Cabbage Patch
dolls, Scrabble and Parcheesi.
   These additions plus a new line of battery powered racing cars
called Record Breakers places Hasbro in a good position to enter
the Christmas buying season, Hassenfeld said.
   For the first nine months of this year, Hasbro earned $68.2
million, or $1.15 a share, up nearly 33 percent from $51.3 million,
or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $992.7
million, about 3 percent higher than $962.9 million in 1988.

Hasbro to 12% rise
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Good sales in the run up to Christmas helped Hasbro, the biggest US toy
maker, report a 12 per cent increase in fourth-quarter turnover to Dollars
932.2m. But a charge to cover the cost of closing its factory in the
Netherlands, announced last month, limited profits growth to 8 per cent.
Net income was Dollars 70.7m compared with Dollars 65.6m last time, while
earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead at 78 cents. Hasbro said if it had
not been for the Dollars 15m charge it took against pre-tax profits for the
plant closure, net income would have risen by 22 per cent.
Hasbro said some of its biggest domestic successes came from its Kenner
division, which handles its Littlest Pet Shop and Jurassic Park lines.
Hasbro Toy, after difficulties earlier in the year, saw good sales of
Tonka's Talk 'n Play Fire Truck and The Real Power Tool Shop.
The Playskool operation was buoyed by successes with Talking Barney and
traditional products like Play-Doh and Tinkertoy. The games division saw
good sales of new products like Don't Wake Daddy, Ask Zandar and Jenga, and
traditional games like Monopoly, Scrabble and The Game of Life.
Internationally, the company saw strong performances from its operations in
Canada, Mexico, Britain and Germany, but suffered the currency translation
effects of the rising US dollar.
For the full year, revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn, net income
rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 200m, and earnings per share rose by 10 per
cent to Dollars 2.22.
Hasbro will join other US toy manufacturers in unveiling its new products
for 1994 at the American International Toy Fair in New York next week.

<HEAD>Hasbro Agrees to Purchase Certain Assets in Coleco Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. announced Monday it has
agreed to purchase certain assets of the indoor-outdoor children's
furniture and ride-on divisions of financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. for $21 million.
   Under the agreement, Hasbro officials said it will purchase
specific assets, including inventory and tooling, machinery and
equipment and some property rights.
   Hasbro will also buy two manufacturing facilities in Amsterdam,
N.Y., officials said, where the acquired product lines are produced.
   The lines include plastic wading and splashing pools, pool
filers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal- and
battery-operated cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million. The toymaker is based in
West Hartford, Conn.
   ``The addition of these products will provide additional balance
and stability to our overall line,'' said Hasbro chairman Stephen
Hassenfeld in a printed release.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the board of directors
of both companies.
   The deal has been a topic of speculation for more than a month.
   Coleco has been trying since March without success to
restructure its massive debt.
   The company had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock, saying the exchange would save
it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash
for the business.
   When that plan collapsed, Coleco received short-term financing
from a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders, to which it owes
$103 million.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games. It lost $47.4 million in the first
quarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past
five years, including $215 million in the last two years.

   Hasbro Inc. plans to begin producing
popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls immediately now that it has
completed the purchase of most product lines from financially
troubled Coleco Industries Inc., the company says.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, completed its purchase of
Coleco's major assets on Wednesday for $85 million cash and an
option for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro at $28.85
after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed, said Barry Alperin,
Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Hasbro closed at $20 on the American Exchange Wednesday, down 25
cents.
   The Pawtucket-based company said it had reached agreement with
Original Appalachian Artworks, owner and creator of Cabbage Patch
Kids, to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately, in time to
advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including Scrabble, Parcheesi, Perfection and
Aggravation, also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   ``Milton Bradley ... has the capacity there and they've handled
things like this before,'' Alperin said.
   Hasbro also bought the right to use Coleco's name and would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   ``We will be putting on some people to handle Cabbage Patch, but
we're talking tens or twentys,'' Alperin said. ``These are short
term decisions and we'll deal with this on a long term basis as we
get into it.''
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985,
compared with $58 million last year.
   But the transaction's success does not rest solely on Cabbage
Patch products, Alperin said. Some of the board games, for example,
``are tried and true names in the games field,'' he said.
   Alperin would not release internal figures estimating projected
revenues for the new products.
   Coleco is far from Hasbro's most ambitious purchase. It aqcuired
Milton Bradley in 1984 for more than $350 million, Alperin said.
   The Connecticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act a year ago,
citing debts of $540.3 million.

Hasbro Inc. officials refused to comment Tuesday on published reports that the 
world's biggest toy maker would buy most of Coleco Industries Inc. under a plan 
to be presented in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The Hartford Courant on Tuesday quoted sources close to Avon-based Coleco's 
10-month-old bankruptcy case as saying that details of the purchase were being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Alperin, executive vice president of Hasbro Inc., said representatives of 
both companies were forbidden to speak publicly about the case under an order 
issued last month by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.

<P>
A secretary for Coleco's chairman, Morton Handel, said he would be away from 
his office all day but would not say where he could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Hasbro, Coleco and Coleco's creditors are scheduled to 
discuss the plan today before the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, expected to be announced today, would strengthen Hasbro's position in 
the toy business by adding to its product lines well-known Coleco items such as 
Cabbage Patch Kids and the board games Scrabble and Parcheesi. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco grew into one of the nation's largest toy makers over the past decade, 
propelled in large part by the popularity of its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. 
Demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and Coleco was unsuccessful in 
introducing new products.

white gibbon apes.
   On her 99th birthday, she went to the animal park to take her

never duplicated the feat. On her 100th, she had her first airplane
flight
   In 1982, at age 101, she drove back to Lincoln, Neb., with her
daughter, Phyllis McMeekin of Roseburg, for a family gathering.
They then flew to Philadelphia and toured several Eastern states.
   When she turned 103, ``Dear Reader,'' a book about Rust's life
was published. It was written by McMeekin, with whom Rust has lived
for the past 35 years. Also in 1984, Rust's first
great-great-great-grandchild was born.
   Although not a first, Rust danced with her son-in-law and
another man on her 105th birthday during a party at the Senior
Center. Later in the year, McMeekin caught Rust crocheting and
reading at the same time. When she commented on it, Rust said, ``I
can't waste any time.''
   Her 106th year brought her first ride on a motorcycle. Her
grandson took her on the ride around the trailer park where Rust
lives. Upon dismounting the motorcycle, Rust announced, ```There,
I've done one more thing I'd never done in my life,''' McMeekin
recalled.
   While Rust was 107 years old, she had a lens implant in her
right eye, which improved her vision so she could continue
crocheting granny squares. During the 2{ years that ended June
1989, Rust crocheted nearly 1,900 granny squares.
   During the past year, a book titled ``One Hundred over 100,''
was published and included an article about Rust. The author, Jim
Heynen, interviewed Rust when she was 106 years old.
   In the interview, she and Heynen played Scrabble and Rust won by
about 20 points. In the book, Heynen describes her as the kind of
person who will hoard the ``U'' letter squares when she knows her
opponent has the ``Q.''
   Scrabble, Anagrams and Aggravation have long been Rust's
favorite games. She also enjoys word puzzles and reading.
   Her hearing has deteriorated in the last few years, so she
doesn't visit with people as much as she used to. In past years,
McMeekin said Rust and her oldest daughter would reminisce for
hours.
   Rust was born June 18, 1881, in a sod house in Hainesville, Neb.
She and her husband were married in Butte, Neb., and they had 12
children. All but one are still living.
   Daughter Emma Nelson, of Norfolk, Neb., died in 1989 at age 77.
The other children range from age 87 to 65.
   Rust has 211 descendants. Besides her children, there are 36
grandchildren, 86 great-grandchildren, 74 great-great-grandchildren
and four great-great-great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which soared
to the top of the toy industry in the mid-1980s with its Cabbage
Patch Kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls' popularity
waned, announced today it filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Coleco said the filing, which did not include its Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries, was made Monday evening in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
   The toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its
short-term bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an
adequate working capital credit line.
   Coleco also announced that Morton E. Handel, who is recovering
from recent open-heart surgery, has submitted his resignation as
chief executive officer, citing the company's need for a full-time
CEO during this period. He will continue as chairman of the company.
   The board of directors appointed J. Brian Clarke, currently
president and chief operating officer, as president and chief
executive officer.
   The bankruptcy filing had been expected after Coleco was unable
to persuade its bondholders to agree to a $335 million debt
restructuring. The company lost $47.4 million in the quarter that
ended April 2 and has suffered losses in four of the past five
years, including $215 over the last two years.
   Coleco owes more than $100 million to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders.
   In recent weeks, the company has tried to raise cash by selling
off some of its product lines. On Monday, Hasbro Inc., the nation's
largest toymaker, said it had agreed to purchase some of Coleco's
assets and lines for $21 million, including the plastic wading and
splashing pools and children's outdoor furniture lines.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million.
   Coleco also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in the United
States, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   Besides Cabbage Patch Kids, Coleco manufactures Alf dolls, Big
Wheels plastic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble.
Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
   Analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped
Coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage Patch Kids in
1983 helped bring on its troubles.
   The dolls, introduced in 1983 after a number of other toy
companies rejected the product, helped Coleco end 1985 in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $776 million and
record earnings of $64 million.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry suffered
a slump in 1987, the company was hit particularly hard.
   Coleco has faced tough times before. It entered the snowmobile
business in 1972, but snowfalls were light for the next three
years, the economy was depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a $22 million loss in 1978, threatening its
survival. In 1980 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its
$600 Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost $79.8 million in 1984 despite $540 million in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Sale of Coleco to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale
of financially troubled Coleco Industries Inc.'s major product lines
to the nation's largest toymaker, Hasbro Inc.
   Under the terms of the deal, Hasbro will pay $85 million in cash
for most of Coleco's products, including such widely known toys as
the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games.
   Approval of the sale Friday signaled the end of the nearly
yearlong bankruptcy case of the Avon, Conn.-based toymaker.
   Judge Prudence B. Abram, who approved the sale, predicted that
the complex case, which has involved a frequently acrimonious battle
between creditors, could be wrapped up by the fall.
   Coleco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on July 11, 1988, citing debts of
$540.3 million.
   Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president, testified
Friday that the Pawtucket, R.I., company wants to complete the
purchase by next week so it can begin advertising and producing the
Coleco products before the Christmas sales season begins.
   Once the sale is completed, most of the remaining 80 employees at
Coleco's headquarters will be laid off in phases as the business is
closed and the court case completed, said J. Brian Clark, Coleco's
president and chief executive officer.
   After the sale, Coleco will retain a few minor toy products, some
real estate and more than $135 million in cash _ the $85 million
from Hasbro plus $50 million in the bank.
   Coleco plans to sell its remaining products and real estate and
reorganize as a new company. Most of the new company's stock will be
owned by Coleco's creditors, with current stockholders owning a
minority interest.
   Coleco's largest creditors, New York businessmen Isaac Perlmutter
and Bernard Marden, will receive a total of $65 million of the cash
gained through the reorganization.
   The payment is $26 million less than the total owed to them, but
the two agreed to the reduced amount to settle a lawsuit filed
against them by the unsecured creditors' committee in the bankruptcy
case.
   The committee's suit charged that Perlmutter and Marden cheated
Coleco out of $71 million through separate business dealings with
the company from 1986 to 1988.
   When Coleco reorganizes, it will have to come up with a new name
because Hasbro is buying the right to use the Coleco name on toys.
   Handel joked during testimony Thursday that executives had
considered but rejected the name ``Toys Were Us.''

CAPE FEAR (18) Empire
ONCE UPON A CRIME (PG) Odeon Marble Arch
MEN OF RESPECT (18) MGM Oxford St
JOHN CASSAVETES SEASON ICA
Do we need the sight of a great modern film-maker jumping out at us from
behind a camera and saying 'Boo]'? This in essence is the experience
provided by Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear. There are more gratuitous coups de
cinema per minute than there are quills per inch upon a fretful porcupine.
Remaking the 1962 hoodlum-at-large thriller that starred Gregory Peck and
Robert Mitchum, Scorsese provides a lexicon of visual ingenuities. Jump
cuts, painted skies, zoom-in-track-outs, rearing crane shots (even in
intimate conversation scenes), colour mutating to monochrome . . . Yet that
is all the film sometimes seems like: a lexicon. One is reminded of Bruce
Willis's breathless aside in The Last Boy Scout when he and his chum are
attacked by a loquaciously abusive baddie: 'Feels like we're being beaten up
by the inventor of Scrabble.'
Scorsese's game is Movie Scrabble. You win a double-quote-score for wryly
invoking the original Cape Fear, as when an ageing Peck and Mitchum stroll
into cameo roles as sleazy lawyer and Southern sheriff respectively. And you
win a triple-quote-score if, like Robert De Niro as the vengeful ex-convict
who pursues and psychologically torments the defence lawyer who failed him
(Nick Nolte) plus his wife (Jessica Lange) and nubile daughter (Juliette
Lewis), you can pay tribute to as many roles and actors as possible.
De Niro's Max Cady is one part Mitchum - more The Night Of The Hunter than
Cape Fear - to several large parts of Lionel Barrymore and GD Spradlin. With
his Hawaian shirt, airport sun-glasses and loony ebullience, he also
suggests Fred Flintstone on a works outing to Florida. (The nominal setting
is North Carolina but the film was shot, and looks like it, around Fort
Lauderdale). The movie is fun, but is it art? Like any good game of Scrabble
it is at least for a while diverting. From the first image in the titles
sequence - the camera rising from primeval waters to cue jagged letters
against a riverswept background - Scorsese is determined to go Gothic.
Hammer-horror cloudscapes lower over Nolte and Lange's handsome mansion;
deep-focus effects pay homage to Citizen Kane; and fairy-tale ghoulishness
is invoked in the queasy scene where De Niro, luring Miss Lewis's pubescent
teenager to the school basement cum makeshift theatre, plays Big Bad Wolf to
her Red Riding Hood with a mock-up gingerbread cottage behind him. This duel
of innuendo between a shyly ripening girl and a slippery psychopath - we
have already seen him brutalise a woman and bite a chunk from her cheek -
has a quietly hypnotic power.
But typically of this cleverer-than-thou thriller Miss Lewis, unlike her
1962 predecessor, is no innocent. Coming 30 years on to the same story
(based on John D MacDonald's novel The Executioners), Scorsese and
screenwriter Wesley Strick feel they must muddy the Manichean waters of good
guys versus bad. But in doing so, they also muddy its dramatic clarity of
purpose.
Nolte and Lange are an overwritten problem couple with an over-telegraphed
problem daughter. He is a he-man repressed by small-town life, his small
eyes penned in behind wire-rim specs. She is a designer with a Lange-ian
line in tremulous hysteria.
They are clearly in such deep domestic turmoil already - with his
infidelities and her keening reproaches - that the arrival of Mr Madman from
the Slammer would seem a minor addition to their problems. Possibly even a
welcome diversion. As a result the violent finale aboard a drifting,
waveswept houseboat - where De Niro keeps bobbing back to life in the best
ghoul-can't-help-it tradition - has the frivolous excitement of a fairground
ride rather than the visceral horror of a face-to-face with death.
With no sense of emotional hazard there is no sense of suspense. Instead of
a horrified 'Ah no]' in response to scenes, we keep mouthing an admiring 'Ah
yes]' The director who crafted Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas is
here aided by a good cameraman (Freddie Francis) and a great production
designer (Henry Bumstead of Vertigo). But all that results is that the
tunnel-vision intensity the tale requires is ousted by decorative overkill.
This even extends to the star player. De Niro lolls across the CinemaScope
screen as if determined to colonise every inch of it. He snarls and croons
and teases; he savours his Southern accent like fine wine. He is a
vaudeville charmer in a vaudeville thriller. His only saving grace is that,
unlike everyone else in the film, he seems to know it is a deep dark joke
and not to be taken seriously as a spinechiller-turned-psychodrama.
Worse, far worse, is the Euro-comedy Once Upon A Crime. What a title. They
probably came up with it after rejecting Sweet Sistine and Abandon Pope for
this Rome-set plot about a murder, a valuable dachshund and six
second-magnitude stars hurtling about delivering dead dialogue. They include
Cybill Shepherd, James Belushi, Sean Young, John Candy and an
embarrassed-looking George Hamilton wearing boot polish as a tanned,
over-age toyboy.
Did I say Rome? Well, it begins there, then moves to Monte Carlo. But by
this stage the Press show audience was being examined by a doctor for signs
of rigor mortis. Startlingly, or perhaps not, three writers are credited
with having struggled over the script. The best dialogue exchange - 'Are you
finished?", 'No, I'm Swedish' - will give you a measure of the rest. Eugene
Levy directed.
Men Of Respect is Macbeth remade as a Mafia thriller. Dr Jonathan Miller is
to blame for all this. Dear me, the cultural cost of that Rigoletto. Here we
have Rod Steiger and Peter Boyle among the Cosa Nostra bigwigs, John 'Barton
Fink' Turturro as the modern Macbeth ('No man born of woman can do shit to
me') and Katherine Borowitz as a Mafiosa Lady M given to scouring the
bathroom with bleach. Meanwhile Banquo is called Banky, MacDuff Duffy and
Malcolm Mal. When they do Hamlet it will no doubt be Hammy, Ophie and Gert.
William Reilly wrote and directed.
Far better to visit the ICA's John Cassavetes season, running for one more
week. The wild man of American cinema, who died last year, made films that
were like the fearless, flailing revelations of a patient under truth serum.
He wrote his own stories - of marital break-up and nervous breakdown, of
high and low living on the Bohemian fringes - and had them improvised into
life by his handpicked repertory of actor-friends. Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk,
Gena Rowlands, himself: his favourite stars kept being recycled in plots
that were as untidy as Columbo's mac and as challengingly, endearingly
human. Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under The Influence, The Killing Of A Chinese
Bookie. The best is here. Catch it while you can.

   Troubled Coleco Industries Inc. has agreed
to sell most of its assets to Hasbro Inc. for $85 million in cash, a
deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced
the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the Cabbage Patch doll.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy analyst with New York-based
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Avon-based Coleco, now
operating under Bankruptcy Court protection, also will receive
warrants to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro stock.
   Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro, the largest U.S. toymaker, will
receive Coleco's product line, which includes the Scrabble and
Parcheesi board games as well as the Cabbage Patch dolls, Coleco
Chairman Morton Handel said.
   In addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the
products, Hasbro will buy certain accounts receivable, Handel said.
   Coleco will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate
that it will convert to cash, Handel said. At the completion of the
transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million in cash _ the
$85 million from Hasbro and about $65 million Coleco had in the
banks in mid-March, Handel said.
   The cash will be used to pay off the company's debt, he said.
When Coleco filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, it listed
debt of $540.3 million.
   The agreement still must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
Handel said. The deal is also subject to the approval of Original
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and Coleco
directors.
   If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's remaining 250 employees
are expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by Hasbro,
Handel said.
   ``Coleco was pretty much the victim of its own success,'' said
David Leibowitz, senior vice president of New York-based American
Securities Corp. ``Cabbage Patch in 1985 was the largest single
selling toy of all time, selling $600 million-plus at wholesale.''
   The success of the homely Cabbage Patch dolls forced Coleco to
expand, borrowing money to do so, he said. When Cabbage Patch Kids
sales tumbled and new products _ including the Adam home computer
and toys based on Rambo movies _ did not sell, the company could not
pay off the new debts, he said.
   Valentine said Arnold Greenberg, the former Coleco chairman,
managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost
controls.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' Valentine said. But, he added, it was Greenberg who
transformed Coleco into a major company.
   Greenberg's Russian immigrant father, Maurice Greenberg, founded
the company as the Connecticut Leather Co. in Hartford in 1932,
selling leather and shoe heels and soles. The company expanded into
toys in 1954.
   Arnold Greenberg joined Coleco full time in 1966. He bought the
license to the Cabbage Patch Kids in 1982 after several major toy
companies turned down the dolls, which were designed with their own
set of adoption papers.
   For growing Hasbro, which in the last decade has bought such
big-name toymakers as Milton Bradley Co. and introduced a steady
stream of new products, the deal means yet another line of toys.
   Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and
the Transformers, had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from just
$104.3 million in 1980.
   ``Under Hasbro, I think Cabbage Patch will grow substantially
over the next few years,'' Valentine said. ``Even Barbie has her ups
and downs. The Cabbage Patch Kids won't wilt forever.''

   Portland, Ore. -- Mah-jongg is all the rage in this neck
of the woods. I had to wait three whole months to get into
one of the local how-to classes, which are churning out
mah-jongg foursomes faster than you can say, "One bam West]"
   By all accounts, the last time this happened was about 70
years ago. A 1924 article in the Oregonian stated that
mah-jongg mania was spreading like a contagion: "Matrons and
flappers have fallen for its wiles, and fallen hard."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A lot has changed in 70 years, and today's players can
fall for any number of mah-jongg variations, including
Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Jewish and Wright-Patterson.
   Me, I learned the Jewish version -- also known as American
or international -- mah-jongg. Its rules are Greek to my
friend Carol, who is Chinese. As for my friend Rod, he plays
by Wright-Patterson rules, which originated in the 1920s at
an Air Force base of that name near Dayton, Ohio.
   Unfortunately, as things stand we can't play together.
About all we can recognize from one game to another are the
decorated tiles and the various suits. But the number of
tiles used for each version and the names for them differ.
Rod says "character," I say "crak," Carol says "wan."
Likewise, "bamboo," "bam" and "tiao" are different words for
the same thing.
   At a glance, mah-jongg resembles a cross between gin rummy
and Scrabble. The playing pieces are plastic tiles,
originally made from bone or ivory with bamboo backs.
Everybody draws tiles in turn and sets them up on racks. Out
of the view of the other players, they attempt to create a
particular combination of the numbers or images shown on the
tiles.
   The first player to compile a winning hand cries,
"Mah-jongg]" and the game ends. Depending on the type of
game, the winner then can collect praise (my teacher taught
us to applaud and exclaim, "Mah jel tov]"), points or money.
   Nobody seems to know why people are brushing off their
dusty sets of mah-jongg tiles and going at it again after all
these years, but I suspect it has something to do with the
popularity of Amy Tan's book "The Joy Luck Club," in which
the people play mah-jongg (Chinese version), and the film
"Driving Miss Daisy," in which Miss Daisy plays mah-jongg
(Jewish version).
   Mah-jongg mavens of all stripes say there is more interest
in the game than ever. Helen Kelly, president of the
Officers' Wives Club at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, told
me orders for their rule books are coming in from air bases
and embassies around the world. This pleases Mrs. Kelly, who
can always find a foursome wherever her husband is stationed.
   Ruth Unger, president of the National Mah Jongg League in
New York City, which was founded in 1937, says the league's
world-wide membership is 150,000 and climbing. For members,
the high point of each year is the mah-jongg cruise, which
finds hundreds of women sailing around some exotic locale
(this year it's Acapulco) that they never notice.
   "Many of the ladies don't get off the ship when we hit
port," said Mrs. Unger. "Or they don't go to sleep. They just
sit and play."
   Mrs. Kelly liked the idea of a cruise, but, loyal Air
Force wife that she is, suggested that Wright-Patterson
players could board a plane instead, then circle the globe
for the time it takes them to play their fill.
   Mrs. Unger said she has never played by Wright-Patterson
rules, even though the league supplies the air base with
mah-jongg sets. But Mrs. Kelly said she once tried
international mah-jongg.
   "It was foreign to me but I played because I wanted to
play mah-jongg," she said. "Any port in a storm, you know."
   Both women made it clear that with mah-jongg, when you
gotta play, you gotta play. They said the game is like no
other in that real bonding occurs during mah-jongg. There is
no such thing as, say, canasta bonding.
   "I don't know if it's the magic of the tiles or what,"
said Mrs. Unger. "But mah-jongg is special. It's really more
than a game, I'd say."
   Some mah-jongg enthusiasts love the game so much that they
wax poetic. Here is a sampling from Mrs. Unger's mailbag: "I
love playing mah-jongg/I love it a lot./ But my head is just
spinning/With crak, bam and dot.
   Another mah-jongg bard's heart was in the right place,
though her meter wasn't: "Our friendship started with one
bam,/ Two dot and a West./But has grown close over the
year/And is absolutely the best."
   I hate to put a damper on this love fest, but in my
conversations with mah-jongg enthusiasts around town, I did
detect a tinge of rivalry between the various loyalists. Some
say their version of mah-jongg requires more brain power than
the others.
   Brains? No one said anything about brains in my class. In
fact, my teacher said, and I quote:
   "There's one thing you have to have in order to have a
successful game. You have to have nosh."
   You know, good food. Good food, good friends, good tiles.
What more could you ask? Mah-jongg forever]

<HEAD>Coleco Nearing Sale to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. officials declined comment
Tuesday on published reports that Hasbro, the world's biggest
toymaker, would buy most of Coleco Industries Inc. under a plan to
be presented in bankruptcy court.
   The Hartford Courant said Tuesday that sources close to
Avon-based Coleco's 10-month-old bankruptcy case told the newspaper
that details of the plan still were being negotiated.
   Barry Alperin, executive vice president of Hasbro Inc., declined
to comment on the report, saying the companies were forbidden from
discussing the case in public by an order last month from U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   A secretary for Coleco's chairman, Morton Handel, said he would
be away from his office all day. She declined to say where he could
be contacted.
   Representatives of Hasbro, Coleco and Coleco's creditors are
scheduled to appear Wednesday in bankruptcy court in New York to
discuss the plan.
   The deal expected to be announced Wednesday would strengthen
Hasbro's position in the toy business by adding such well-known
Coleco items as Cabbage Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games to its product lines.
   While many details are unknown, sources told The Courant that
the deal would provide that:
   _Much of Coleco would be sold to Hasbro, but it could not be
determined whether Pawtucket, R.I.-based company would buy all of
Coleco or just most of its assets. If Coleco is sold, it would end
57 years as an independent company.
   _Coleco's committee of unsecured creditors would drop its $71
million lawsuit against the company's largest creditors, New York
businessmen Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.
   _Perlmutter and Marden, in turn, would reduce their $80 million
claim against Coleco by an undetermined amount.
   The lawsuit contends that Perlmutter and Marden, who are secured
creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars through a
complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products.
   The deal would be a victory for Coleco's unsecured creditors,
because a reduced claim by Perlmutter and Marden means more money
would be available to repay them, the newspaper said. Coleco had
debts of $540.3 million when it filed for protection from its
creditors under the bankruptcy laws in July.
   Coleco grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies
during the past decade, propelled in large part by its Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls.
   But demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and Coleco
was not successful at introducing new products to make up for the
lost sales. The company sought Bankruptcy Court protection last
year.
   Coleco filed its first reorganization plan in late January,
detailing how it planned to repay creditors. But that proposal
immediately was rejected by the creditors' committee, which said it
provided inadequate payment and appeared to favor Perlmutter and
Marden's interests over the committee's.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering selling the company
outright to resolve its financial problems.
   A few weeks later, however, the company reversed itself and said
it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a
larger repayment to creditors, consisting of about 10 cents for
every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   Coleco had not yet filed that new plan with the Bankruptcy Court
when creditors announced April 19 that they had negotiated a deal
to sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.

   Coleco Industries Inc. creditors say they have
agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the troubled toymaker's
11-month bankruptcy case.
   The settlement, announced Wednesday during a hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, must be approved by the court.
   Meanwhile, no details were released about a proposal by Hasbro
Inc., the nation's largest toy manufacturer, to purchase most of
Coleco. But Daniel Golden, an attorney for Coleco, said
negotiations concerning the sale of most Coleco assets continued.
   Richard Tilton, a lawyer for Hasbro, said he expected a joint
statement on the proposed sale would be issued next week. He
declined to discuss details of the plan, saying it still was
``subject to a number of conditions that need to be discussed.''
   The creditors' settlement announced Wednesday calls for Coleco's
largest creditors, Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden, to receive
$61 million of their $87 million claim against Coleco.
   Unsecured creditors of the company based in Avon, Conn., would
drop their $71 million lawsuit against Perlmutter and Marden, under
the settlement.
   The unsecured creditors had claimed that Perlmutter and Marden,
secured creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars
through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for
products.
   Tilton said the settlement would mean that Perlmutter could not
finance Coleco's reorganization plan as originally intended. But
Tilton said alternative sources of funding could be found. He did
not elaborate.
   Coleco, which grew to be one of the nation's largest toymakers
during the past decade, suffered a change in fortune in 1986, when
demand for its Cabbage Patch dolls dropped.
   New lines introduced by the company failed to make up for lost
sales, and Coleco sought Bankruptcy Court protection last July,
citing debts of $540.3 million.
   A first reorganization plan filed by Coleco in January was
rejected immediately by the creditors' committee.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering a sale of the company,
but reversed itself a few weeks later, filing a new reorganization
plan it hoped would satisfy creditors.
   The new plan offered a larger repayment, including about 10
cents for every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   On April 19, before the second plan was filed with the
Bankruptcy Court, creditors announced they had negotiated a deal to
sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.
   The deal would add well-known Coleco items such as the Cabbage
Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board games to Hasbro's
product lines, it has been reported.
   Coleco officials, upset by the Hasbro proposal, asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram on April 20 to issue a
restraining order prohibiting creditors from pursuing the plan with
Hasbro.
   Instead, Abram urged the two sides to strike a compromise.

<HEAD>Toymaker Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new management team is in place
today at Coleco Industries Inc., and the company that brought
Cabbage Patch Kids to the marketplace is seeking protection from
its creditors in bankruptcy court.
   The West Hartford-based company on Tuesday gave up a months-long
battle to reach an agreement to reorganize its debts with its banks
and bondholders, announcing it had filed for federal bankruptcy
court protection from creditors.
   Coleco said it filed for Chapter 11 protection late Monday with
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The
filing will permit the company to continue operating while it
reorganizes its finances.
   The Coleco board appointed J. Brian Clarke, currently president
and chief operating officer, as president and chief executive
officer.
   Clarke replaces Morton E. Handel, who is recovering from
open-heart surgery. Handel submitted his resignation as chief
executive officer because of the company's need for a full-time CEO
during this period. He will continue as chairman of the board.
   The Chapter 11 filing had been expected ever since Coleco
announced in March it suffered a $105.4 million loss for all of
1987 and would miss an April interest payment on its debentures.
Coleco said the filing did not include the company's Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from company officials on
Tuesday were not returned.
   Coleco owes more than $100 million to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders. In March, shortly after it announced a $47.4
million loss for the first quarter, the toymaker proposed a $335
million debt restructuring plan.
   But late last month, Coleco was forced to abandon the plan
because it failed to win approval of the company's debtholders. The
company said Tuesday it was no longer able to obtain working
capital financing because of the failed plan and because some
creditors had started to attach its assets.
   Over the past year, the toymaker slashed its work force in an
effort to cut costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in
the United States, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   It also has sold several of its product lines to raise cash.
   ``What is going to emerge is going will be very different from
what went in,'' said analyst David Leibowitz, senior vice president
of American Securities Corp.
   Five years ago, Coleco was on top of the toy world with its
Cabbage Patch Kids. The company sold $1 billion worth of the dolls
over two years.
   The Cabbage Patch craze prompted Coleco to expand its product
lines and make acquisitions. Coleco bought the company that makes
Scrabble board games, acquired the license to the popular Trivial
Pursuit board game and bought the company that makes Wrinkles
stuffed animals.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry slumped
in 1987, Coleco was hit particularly hard.
   The company suffered losses in four of the past five years,
including $215 million over the last two years.
   It recently lost the license to market Trivial Pursuit because
of its precarious financial state.
   But Coleco said Tuesday it managed to retain the license for the
valuable Cabbage Patch line. Coleco said it had extended its
license with Original Appalachian Artworks Inc. until Dec. 31, 1994.

   PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Hasbro Inc. said net income rose 61% in
the fourth quarter, reflecting a 54% increase in revenue
buoyed by healthy Christmas sales and contributions from its
acquisition last year of Tonka Corp.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toy and game maker, posted
net of $44.8 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with
$27.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fourth-quarter revenue of $761.2 million, up from $492.8
million in the 1990 fourth quarter, included $202 million
from Tonka; excluding Tonka, revenue still grew a healthy
13%.
   "Hasbro finished up for the year in strong fashion, and
its results are right in line with expectations," said
analyst Gary M. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He pointed
out that the company's earnings were depressed in the 1990
fourth quarter because of write-offs from several toy
retailers -- including Child World Inc. -- that were having
difficulties.
   "The integration of {Tonka} operations is now
substantially complete, and we expect they will be a positive
contributing factor to the combined operations in 1992," said
Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Hasbro was helped by the Christmas sales successes of
Go-Go My Walking Pup, Scrabble, Electronic Hotshot Basketball
and the revitalized G.I. Joe line.
   Net for the year was $81.7 million, or $1.41 a share, on
revenue of $2.14 billion after a pretax restructuring charge
of $59 million recorded in the second quarter for the Tonka
purchase. In 1990, the company had net of $89.2 million, or
$1.54 a share, on revenue of $1.52 billion.
   The company's growth is increasingly coming from its
international business, which now accounts for about 40% of
revenue. While domestic revenue rose about 40% in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, international revenue was about
70% higher, said John O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial
officer.

   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the top federal prosecutor of insider trading have
endorsed legislation that would make brokerage firms liable when
employees violate securities laws.
   However, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and U.S. Attorney Rudolph
W. Giuliani cautioned Monday that the law should exempt firms and
supervisors that make a good-faith effort to prevent their
employees from using non-public information to profit from trading
in securities.
   They said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce finance
subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms
would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.

   Hasbro Inc. said Wednesday it had
completed the purchase of most of the product lines of financially
troubled Coleco Industries Inc., and would immediately begin
producing the popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, agreed last week to
purchase Coleco's major assets for $85 million cash and an option
for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Pawtucket-based Hasbro at
$28.85 each after its bankruptcy reorganization plan was confirmed,
said Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Conneticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a year ago, citing
debts of $540.3 million.
   Hasbro stock closed at $20 Wednesday on the American Stock
Exchange, down 25 cents a share.
   Hasbro said it had reached agreement with Appalachian Artworks
Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, to begin manufacturing the
dolls immediately, in time to advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including the Scrabble and Parcheesi games
also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   Hasbro, which also bought the right to use Coleco's name, would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985
but slipped to $58 million by last year.

   Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 16
Western hostages, helped fellow prisoners make Scrabble and
Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a newly freed
captive.
   His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of
diversions, according to an account given by former hostage Frank
Reed to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
   ``They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at
least they did at the time Frank was there,'' Mrs. Say said. These
included boxes of books, writing materials and dominoes.
   Although Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, is in good physical condition from plenty of
exercise, he is tired and needs dental care, Mrs. Say said. She
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their
preference.
   ``Frank preferred a chain on his wrist,'' she said. ``Terry
preferred a chain on his ankle so that his arms are free to write
and play cards.''
   The closest she and Reed were able to calculate that he last saw
Anderson was somewhere between a year and 18 months ago. Reed spent
20 months with Anderson and Thomas Sutherland in Lebanon. For a
period of time, the three American hostages were together with two
others, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan.
   Reed, the director of the private Lebanon International School,
was freed April 30 after being held for 44 months. He is undergoing
medical checkups at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland and
met with Mrs. Say Monday night.
   Anderson is in his sixth year of captivity. Sutherland was a
dean at the American University of Beirut. McCarthy is a British
television journalist. Keenan, who is Irish, taught English at
American University.
   ``He is still a vindictive hearts player,'' Mrs. Say said of her
brother. Reed told her Anderson also reads voraciously, a book a
day.
   Reed said Anderson could pick up some things in Arabic from the
radio and have at least some idea of what he thought was going on
in the world. But his guards have made a concerted effort to keep
from him news of the deaths of his father and brother, both from
cancer, within four months of each other in 1986. Mrs. Say said she
believes that he still does not know.
   ``That's very difficult,'' she said. ``Part of you wants him to
have known and dealt with it and part of you believes it might be
too much for him if he found out in captivity.''
   But with his mind still sharp, he thinks of new birthdays
painfully uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply.
   He is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with
them, unable to savor the passage of Gabrielle from child to woman.
In Anderson's sixth year of captivity, Gabrielle turned 14 on April
26.
   He has never held Sulome, who was born three months after he was
kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985, by Islamic
Jihad, a group loyal to Iran. She will be 5 on June 7.
   ``He was very verbal about his love of them and that was what he
wanted when he got out, to see his daughters,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Unlike Reed, who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnappers
for trying to escape twice, Anderson was left alone. Mrs. Say said
Reed told her Anderson was not beaten.
   Reed told Mrs. Say that her brother was aware of her tireless
campaign to free him and the other hostages.
   Mrs. Say, 49, shuttles between Washington and her home in
Kentucky. She has made several trips to the Middle East seeking his
release. She has met with President Bush, Pope John Paul II, the
archbishop of Canterbury and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. She fields
phone calls all hours of the day and night.
   ``The guards told him (Anderson) everytime I did something of
major import,'' Mrs. Say said. ``Because it has been a criticism
that I've heard, I said to him (Reed), `Does Terry think what I'm
doing is making him be held longer?' And he said, `Absolutely not.
That only gives him hope.'''
