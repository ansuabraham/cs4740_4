The heart of Bwindi's Impenetrable Forest in southern Uganda is home to
almost half the world's population of mountain gorillas - a rare and
endangered species of which fewer than 650 remain. To protect Bwindi's
gentle giants, gorilla tracking permits are strictly rationed: only six
visitors are allowed to enter Bwindi national park each day. Even if
gorillas are not sighted, the experience of exploring Bwindi's virgin
jungle, under the canopy of huge tropical hardwoods, lianas and orchids, is
mysterious and unforgettable.
For the foreseeable future, Uganda's appeal to the foreign visitor will
centre on 'special interest' activities: mountain trekking in the Ruwenzoris
 -the legendary Mountains of the Moon; a visit to Bwindi, or the equally
remote savannah grasslands of the Kidepo Valley near the frontier with
Sudan. It is also in Uganda where the Nile begins its 4,000-mile journey to
the Mediterranean.
International tour operators have begun to include Uganda on their East
African safari circuits, encouraged by the country's efforts to recover its
neglected tourism infrastructure. Abercrombie &amp; Kent have set up two tented
camps near Bwindi and Murchison Falls, and plan to transform the Lake
Victoria Hotel near Entebbe into their five-star showcase in Uganda. Tim
Somerset Webb, president of A &amp; K Overseas Ltd, says he is finalising an
agreement for the management contract and an equity participation in Lake
Victoria Hotel with the state-owned Uganda Hotels Ltd.
Accommodation in Kampala remains overpriced and somewhat below international
standards, but a number of hotels in the capital are undergoing upgrading
and renovation. About 40 local tour operators provide an increasing range of
services for the adventurous traveller.
At the Uganda Tourist Board, above the British Council offices in Kampala,
Freddie Irumba likes to take the long-term view. 'We have to be both
cautious and sensible about promoting Uganda as a holiday destination,' he
says. 'Until our hotels are rehabilitated, the road network improved and our
passenger handling facilities at the airport are up to scratch, we should
not aim to attract large numbers of visitors.' He says the number of
visitors is rising by 20 per cent each year, and estimates arrivals will top
80,000 in 1994.

UGANDA'S ELEPHANT HERDS ENDANGERED, CONSERVATIONIST SAYS 




From Reuters 




KAMPALA, Uganda 




Elephant herds, cut to a fraction of their former size by poachers and 
trigger-happy Ugandan soldiers, will be wiped out soon if current losses 
continue, according to a Ugandan conservation expert. 


Eric Edroma, director of the Uganda Institute of Ecology, said Saturday that 
only 1,500 to 2,000 remain of the 20,000 elephants that roamed Uganda in the 
1960s. 


Most of the losses occurred in the 1970s when dictator Idi Amin's soldiers 
killed the animals indiscriminately. Losses of elephants and other animals 
continued on a large scale in some areas after Amin was overthrown in 1979. 


Edroma said rebels are killing an estimated 10 to 15 elephants a month in the 
Murchison Falls National Park in northern Uganda. The authorities believe ivory 
from the tusks is being smuggled out through Zaire and Sudan, with the proceeds 
used by rebel groups to buy arms and ammunition.

 Uganda 
    Four Acquitted of Smuggling Arms to Yugoslavia 
  AB0202175294 Paris AFP in English 2225 GMT 1 Feb 94

Language:  English 
Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Kampala, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Four Ugandans facing charges 
of involvement in smuggling arms to war-torn Yugoslavia in a 
Ugandan Airlines plane in August 1991 have been acquitted and 
discharged, court officials said here Tuesday [2 February]. 
  They said that those acquitted on Monday by Kampala's chief 
magistrate Yorokamu Bamwine included Uganda's former prime 
minister Abraham Waliggo, who then headed the state-owned 
Ugandan Airlines Corporation (UAC), two pilots Stephen Makyeri 
and Rogatiano Mugisha, and loadmaster David Nsubuga. But a 
fifth accused, Captain Jack Calnan, would continue standing 
trial for abuse of office. 
  At the time of the incident, UAC officials denied that the 
plane, which had been leased from Aviation Leasing Groups (ALG) 
of Kansas City in the United States, "was on Ugandan Airlines 
business when it was caught smuggling arms to Yugoslavia and 
impounded by the Yugoslav authorities". 
  The officials maintained that the ALG and UAC had agreed to 
temporarily suspend the lease between August 15 and October 15 
because the Uganda flag carrier did not need the plane during 
that period. 
  Under the agreement the Ugandan pilot Stephen Makyeri and 
his 
five compatriot crew members were to be retained by ALG during 
the period the lease was in suspension, the officials said. 
  Consequently, the plane left Uganda on August 29, 1991 for 
Gaborone in Botswana, but was diverted to the 
nominally-independent South African homeland of Bophuthatswana, 
where a Canadian citizen of Yugoslav origin, Anton Ikac, who had 
a Ugandan Airlines ticket, apparently boarded the plane and arms 
were loaded, the officials recounted. 
  It returned to Uganda's Entebbe international airport two 
days later carrying what was described as "technical cargo", 
taking off from Entebbe on the next day, but was forced to land 
at Zagreb in Yugoslavia, where it was found to be carrying 19 
tonnes of arms and ammunition. 
  According to the officials, money for refuelling the plane 
at 
Entebbe airport appeared to have been remitted to the Uganda 
branch of the British multi-national oil company, Shell-BP, from 
abroad, heightening suspicions here that senior officials of 
Uganda airlines were in on the deal. 
  A South African arms maker denied having supplied arms to 
separatists in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia as had then been 
claimed in a report in the London weekly SUNDAY TIMES.

THE WORLD 




Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, arrested when he tried to enter Zaire under 
an assumed name last week, boarded a private plane to return to his exile home 
in Saudi Arabia. Amin, who is wanted by the Ugandan government for the torture 
and murder of an estimated 250,000 people during his eight-year rule, is 
believed to have been trying to make his way back to neighboring Uganda, where 
residents say he has a force of 500 guerrillas camped along the Zairian border 
awaiting his orders. A high-ranking Ugandan Foreign Ministry official had 
called for Amin's extradition to Kampala to answer for thousands of atrocities, 
but Zaire chose to deport him instead.

Geologiques et Miniers (BRGM) of France produced for Kilembe Mines Ltd a
pre-feasibility study which concluded that treatment of the pyrites by
bleaching was the most economic and environmentally safe way of recovering
the cobalt.
In June 1992, the Ugandan government signed a joint venture agreement with
BRGM and Barclays Metals Ltd (BML) of the UK to undertake the project. The
new Kasese Cobalt Company wil be jointly owned by the parastatal, Kilembe
Mines Ltd with a 45 per cent shareholding, BRGM (27.5) and BML (27.5).
Results from a pilot plant constructed at nearby Kasese in 1993 confirmed
its viability, and annual production of 1,000 tonnes over a 10 to 12 years.
A feasibility study followed, which confirms the merits of the project. All
being well, commercial production could begin within two years.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 9 (AFP) -- Heavy fighting has erupted 
between Sudanese rebels and government troops near the southern 
town of Kaya, rebel sources said here Sunday [9 January]. 
  An official of the mainstream Sudan People's Liberation Army 
(SPLA) who asked not to be named said fighting broke out early 
last week in areas east of Kaya, close to the Ugandan border. 
  Rebels have since killed 28 goverment soldiers, he claimed, 
but refused to give rebel casualty figures. 
  An SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, Justin Arop, confirmed that 
fighting was raging. 
  Arop gave other regions where fighting was also going on as 
Bor, Yei, Morobo, areas between the southern Sudan regional 
capital of Juba and Kit, and along the railway line in the Bahr 
al Ghazal Province. 
  Ugandan officials said the fresh fighting had triggered a 
new 
influx of refugees into northern Uganda. 
  An estimated 3,000 Sudanese were arriving in the region 
every 
week, Ugandan deputy minister for local government Steven 
Chebrot said. 
  Uganda has a Sudanese refugee population of 200,000. Some 
70,000 of them have arrived in the past five months. 
  The SPLA has waged a decade-long war against the Khartoum 
government to free the mainly animist and Christian southern 
Sudan from domination by the Moslem, Arabised north.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 28 (AFP)--Uganda's President Yoweri 
Museveni said on Friday [28 January] he had ordered the arrest 
and deportation of two Burundi Army officers implicated in the 
October coup attempt in the central African country. Museveni 
told a news conference that although Uganda did not have an 
extradition treaty with Burundi, the two soldiers will not be 
allowed to stay in Uganda. "I have instructed our people to 
arrest the officers and expel them from Uganda although we shall 
not take them back to Burundi," Museveni said. 
  Museveni did not name the soldiers, but last month Burundi 
was reported to have asked Uganda to extradite Major Lazaro 
Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda after the 
October 21 coup attempt. 
  President Melchior Ndadaye was killed when the army, 
dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried to overthrow his 
popularly elected government. 
  Ndadaye was from the majority Hutu group and winner of the 
small highland nation's first multi-party presidential poll. 
  Meanwhile, Museveni and visiting Eritrean President Isayas 
Afewerki signed an agreement for economic and cultural 
cooperation between the two countries. Isayas is scheduled to 
leave Uganda later Friday after a five-day official tour.

The opening of the Masala Chaat Indian takeaway in Kampala was a grand
affair. Its concrete backyard brimmed with the cream of Ugandan society.
Government dignitaries mingled with bankers; the US ambassador chatted with
Asian and Ugandan families. Ms Mumtaz Kassam, a returned Ugandan Asian,
surveyed her restaurant with satisfaction. Her guest of honour, Finance
Minister Joshua Mayanja-Nkangi, delivered an effusive inauguration speech.
They were celebrating, in a modest way, the seven years of stability which
have allowed Ugandans to start rebuilding their lives. Small ventures such
as Ms Kassam's takeaway are a psychological boost to a capital still haunted
by abandoned villas and boarded-up businesses. Kampala, like the rest of the
country, is only a shadow of its former self. But there is a mood of
optimism and a sense of renewal which are rare in Africa today.
President Yoweri Museveni, the architect of Uganda's newfound stability, is
not an easy man to define. An intellectual-turned-soldier, he would be the
World Bank's model African statesman - if only he could be persuaded to
accept western-style democracy. Mr Museveni advocates an open economy,
respect for human rights, a free press and contested local elections, but he
does not believe in multiparty politics.
In its stead, Mr Museveni offers his National Resistance Movement, a broad
church which has taken several political opponents into its fold.
At the village level, Mr Museveni has introduced elected 'resistance
councils' which decide local tax and spending policies and keep government
officials in check. Most Ugandans regard the councils as better than the
former system, inherited from colonial rule, in which government-appointed
village chiefs were a law unto themselves. The resistance councils in turn
nominate delegates to the next tier of government, at parish and district
levels. Topping this edifice is the National Resistance Council, which has
functioned like a legislature for the past seven years.
Participation in the NRM is voluntary, and membership is not mandatory for
Ugandans who wish to stand for public office. But by forcing candidates to
stand as individuals, rather than as representatives of parties, Mr Museveni
ensures there can be no organised challenge to his power.
'This is not a perpetual situation,' Eriya Kategaya, the NRM's national
political commissar, says in defence of the 'movement system' of government.
'We do not rule out a multiparty system for Uganda in the future, but for
the time being, people still associate the old political parties with chaos.
'The NRM does not seek to obliterate ethnic or religious differences,' Mr
Kategaya adds, 'it wants to obliterate the misuse of ethnicity and religion
for political ends.'
As a result, the March elections for a constituent assembly to design
Uganda's new constitution were not without an element of confusion.
Political rallies were banned, and candidates were forbidden to reveal their
political allegiances, although these were well known among the voters.
Instead, they were allowed to 'debate' their views in meetings organised by
local electoral commissions.
The most hotly debated issue was a clause in the draft constitution that
seeks to ban multiparty politics for another five years.
Mr Museveni's detractors - mainly northern and eastern communities which
formed the stronghold for Milton Obote, a former president now living in
exile - regard the Constituent Assembly as an attempt to legitimise the NRM
and Mr Museveni's unelected rule.
'The law has locked us out,' says Mrs Cecilia Ogwal of Mr Obote's Uganda
Peoples Congress. 'Why should we have to field candidates clandestinely? Why
are western donors backing Museveni's regime? They are apologists for a
manipulated democracy.'
But Mr Museveni's victory in presidential elections due later this year is
already a foregone conclusion. Since the new constitution allows a president
to serve for two consecutive five-year terms, Mr Museveni could well be in
power until 2004.
The fact that this does not alarm a majority of Ugandans speaks for Mr
Museveni's unrivalled popularity and for the overriding value placed on
peace and stability. Most Ugandans believe multiparty democracy can wait.
However, even Mr Museveni's supporters worry about the stability of a
political system which hinges entirely on the will of one man. The wounds in
Ugandan society run deep, and nobody cares to speculate about what would
happen to the country if Mr Museveni were suddenly no longer on the scene.

 Uganda 
    Guerrilla Groups Decide To Suspend Armed Struggle

  [Text] The Uganda National Democratic Alliance [UNDA] and 
the Uganda Federal Army [UFA], which have been fighting a 
guerrilla war against the ruling NRM [National Resistance 
Movement] government, have resolved to suspend their armed 
struggle and join fellow Ugandans in trying to influence the 
history of the nation through nonviolent means. In a telefax 
message signed in London today, the chairman and commander in 
chief of the organization, Mr. Sam Luwero, said the leadership 
of the alliance had also decided to dissolve the organization, 
close its offices in London and cease the publication of "Focus 
on Uganda" which has been the mouth-piece of the UNDA/UFA. The 
leadership of the UNDA/UFA had further decided to accept the 
Uganda Government's assurance that all former members of the 
UNDA/UFA shall not be prosecuted and are free to return and join 
other Ugandans to help the government in its task of democratic 
process presently going on in the country. 
  In addition, the UNDA/UFA pledged their total solidarity 
with 
the Uganda Government in all its endeavors to establish a 
pragmatic process of true democracy in Uganda. The statement 
said the decision was in recognition of the fact that the NRM 
government has gone some way in trying to implement most of the 
elements encompassed in the UNDA manifesto of November 1991. 
The decision was also prompted by the fact that the people of 
Uganda are currently involved in an ongoing constitution-making 
process. 
  The statement stressed that it is imperative that all 
peace-loving citizens in our country give (?this venture) a 
chance. The statement added that continued military action is 
no longer a viable option for the UNDA/UFA struggle. 
  We must, the statement said, avoid turning our country into 
another Somalia, Liberia, or Bosnia. That is why the leadership 
of the UNDA/UFA said we (?heed) this directive. They instructed 
all members of the UNDA and officers and men of UFA to 
immediately observe an unconditional cessation of all 
hostilities against the NRM government.

  [Excerpts] The vice president, Dr. Samson Kisekka, has left 
for the Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] capital, Abidjan, to 
represent President Yoweri Museveni at the funeral of President 
Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died in France last year. [passage 
omitted] 
  On his way to Abidjan, the vice president stopped over at 
Nairobi airport, where he talked to the press. Answering a 
question, Dr. Kisekka said African (?strife) originates from the 
politics of hatred, which he attributed mainly to ignorance. He 
stressed the need for vigorous sensitization of our people to 
stop this. He said it is important to cultivate a culture of 
self-reliance to overcome indebtedness and other developmental 
problems. 
  On the revival of the East African Community, he said Uganda 
welcomes the move, realizing the need for a collective economic 
force in the region. Regretting the collapse of the East 
African Community in 1977, he pointed out Uganda's historic 
brotherly ties with Kenya, which witnessed many Kenyans studying 
in Uganda's educational institutions and cooperation in other 
fields. 
  On instability characterizing some countries in Africa, he 
said Uganda had made contributions to the resolution of 
conflicts and to date it has dispatched more than 700 troops to 
Liberia on a peacekeeping mission. 
  On the situation at home, he outlined the government's 
programs which have facilitated a lot of change in the chaos 
before. He said the country is now preparing for Constituent 
Assembly elections which will result in the making of a new 
constitution to form the basis of governance. He said that the 
government is deliberately encouraging leadership by example, 
which has resulted in considerable success in some areas.

NAKABUBI'S village was in mourning last month. Nobody grieved for the death
of yet another Aids victim more than this 31-year-old widow. Her husband had
already died of Aids, and this latest victim was godfather to her youngest
son. He had promised to help with school fees. Now he is dead, Nakabubi must
struggle alone.
Most of the widows in villages across western Uganda have lost their
husbands to Aids. And in a country were women are regarded as chattels,
widows often lose more than just their husbands.
Another widow, Mabel, was evicted from the family home by her in-laws when
her husband died in 1990. They also sold her cows, 'to pay for my husband's
hospital bills'. When she clung to a small banana plot, her brother-in-law
stole the harvest. When she, too, fell sick, the same man took her four
children away. 'If I could only earn a little money,' she says, 'I could get
my children back. Give them love while I live.'
The southern districts of Masaka and Rakai, once known as the granary of
Uganda, bear the heaviest burden of the Aids epidemic outside Kampala, the
capital. Out of the 38,552 Aids cases reported in Uganda by the end of last
year, almost 8,500 were in these two districts.
Every family knows of a relative or a friend afflicted by the condition.
Production of the two main cash crops, coffee and bananas, is dwindling
because Aids is attacking adults in the prime of life. Often, the surviving
partner also has the virus and chooses to expend his or her dwindling
energies producing food crops for the family's subsistence.
Health workers in Masaka say the disease is killing what was a thriving
market town. 'With fewer farmers coming to market, the town merchants are
going out of business or cutting their losses by moving to Kampala,' says Mr
Elias Mugisha, an Aids counsellor who works for TASO, a Ugandan
non-government organisation which cares for Aids and HIV sufferers.
The World Bank, which plans to finance a study on the impact of Aids on the
Ugandan economy, estimates Aids-related deaths will reduce Uganda's
population growth rate from 3.7 to 3.1 per cent from 1995 to the turn of the
century. The crude death rate, which at 20 per 1,000 is already twice the
average among low-income countries, is likely to rise to 26 per 1,000 during
this period.
The deaths are sapping the strength of Uganda's predominantly rural economy.
'Agriculture is suffering,' says Mr Keith Muhakanizi, an economist at the
Finance Ministry. 'As yet, I don't have macro-economic data to sustain this
assertion, but a trip to any village will bear this out. Cash crops are
being abandoned in favour of essential food crops as labour loses
productivity.'
Exports of coffee, Uganda's main cash crop, have fallen from a recent peak
of 176,453 tonnes in 1989 to 123,883 tonnes last year. But low commodity
prices and bad weather have also contributed to the decline.
Beyond issues of output and productivity, Mr Muhakanizi says the cost of
caring for Aids patients is eating up people's savings, leaving less to
invest in economic development.
Government and non-government organisations report that families resent
spending their meagre resources on medication for patients they know will
die. Where charities try to provide bed sheets and other basic comforts for
Aids sufferers, they often find that relatives sell the donated goods to
recoup the cost of caring for the patient.
Aids is also putting an intolerable strain on the extended family network,
which is the only form of social insurance most Africans have. In Uganda,
where annual per capita income is a mere Dollars 167, one of the lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa, the responsibility for housing, feeding, clothing and
educating Aids orphans is often beyond the means of most rural households.
The problem is not confined to rural areas. 'One of our best-trained
economists died of Aids last month,' Mr Muhakanizi regrets. He says
companies are likewise losing skilled workers and can no longer afford to
provide medical care schemes. 'Even our surplus labour will not alleviate
the problem in the long run,' he says.
Mr Manuel Pinto, the director of Uganda's Aids Control Programme, has
resigned himself to the fact that the disease will continue to be the main
killer in Uganda for the foreseeable future. 'Aids takes a long time to
manifest itself, so we are a long way away from seeing the reversal of the
epidemic, or the fruits of our prevention efforts,' he says. The rate of HIV
infection varies from 5 per cent in some rural areas to 30 per cent in urban
areas, and according to government data it is still rising.
'Children are our window of hope,' Mr Pinto says. 'We are trying to educate
those between the ages of five and 15 so that they are kept free from Aids.'
The problem is compounded by the practice of polygamy and the low status of
women in Ugandan society. But slowly, Mr Pinto believes, the government is
getting its educational message across. Agencies such as TASO report that
polygamy in the countryside is on the wane, and that more people are using
condoms.

 Uganda 
    Two More Alleged Burundi Coupists Arrive in Kampala

  [Text] Kampala, 25 Jan (KNA)--Two more Burundi Army 
officers who allegedly led the 21 October 1993 abortive coup 
d'etat, in which President Melchior Ndadaye was killed, have 
fled to Uganda, raising the number to four, according to the 
state-run daily NEW VISION. 
  In its Monday issue, the daily quoted Burundi Embassy 
officials in Kampala as saying that apart from Major Bernard 
Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda in 
November, "We have also learnt about the presence of two others 
in Kampala." He said one was a commando but promised to reveal 
their names later in the week. 
  Bujumbura alleges that Busokoza and Kamana entered Uganda 
through Zaire after the coup, in which President Ndadaye was 
killed on 21 October, had collapsed. 
  The embassy officials further claim that the four wanted 
officers are moving with forged Zairian passports and fake 
names. "At least we have seen them several times at Sheraton and 
Speke hotels in Kampala," they alleged in the interview with the 
NEW VISION. 
  Last Wednesday [19 January], the Burundi ambassador in 
Uganda, Leonidas Havyarimana, called on Uganda's internal 
security organization, ISO, chief Brigadier Jim Muhwezi and 
reportedly raised the same issue. Muhwezi is reported to have 
assured the envoy of Uganda's readiness to track down the wanted 
officers. 
  Uganda and Burundi have no extradition treaty, but on 2 
January, Muhwezi said if the coup plotters are captured here, 
then international law will be applied or other diplomatic 
avenues will be explored. 
  Other sources say President Yoweri Museveni had also assured 
Bujumbura authorities, who visited him on 30 December, that the 
suspects would be apprehended if found in Uganda. 
  Maj. Busokoza, who is said to be in his forties, had until 
the coup been managing director of Burundi Telecommunications. 
Kamana, described as a young officer in his thirties, was a 
paratrooper.

When the World Bank and other donors abruptly cancelled their support for
Uganda's National Aids Secretariat, the shock waves went through the entire
edifice of donor-funded projects that prop up Uganda's economy.
The secretariat had appealed in November for Dollars 450m to fund a
'multisectoral' plan to combat the disease. It proved to be the last straw
for donors already exasperated by the failings of the secretariat. 'We are
interested in fighting Aids, not funding an Aids bureaucracy,' one of the
donors present at the meeting explained.
The secretariat's staff had not been up to the job, causing donors to
question whether they had been too ambitious for one of their model pupils
in Africa.
Uganda has been smothered with aid since President Yoweri Museveni's
government adopted a World Bank-approved programme of economic reforms six
years ago. The international community, delighted with Mr Museveni's
enlightened, if unelected, leadership, pledged more than Dollars 825m in aid
this year, an amount equivalent to a quarter of Uganda's gross domestic
product.
Foreign aid finances 60 per cent of government spending. Even the luggage
trolleys at Entebbe airport say 'donated by the UN Development Programme'.
Aid has financed every development project since the end of the civil war in
1986. Most of it has gone on rebuilding roads, dams, electricity and
telephone systems destroyed during the war. Donors are also involved in
rebuilding civil society: providing judges to train new magistrates,
inspectors for the police force, and cash for the demobilisation of
soldiers.
But their generosity has begun to outstrip Uganda's ability to absorb the
aid. The World Bank estimates it has a backlog of projects worth Dollars
750m awaiting implementation. In some cases the government has been unable
to contribute the 10 per cent counterpart funding for projects demanded by
the World Bank. In others, the underpaid bureaucracy has been slow to get
projects off the ground.
'I think we have reached the point where we have to take a hard look at the
amount of aid Uganda is getting,' says Mr Chukwuma Obidegwu, the resident
World Bank economist in Kampala. 'My main concern is that it discourages
Ugandans from developing the exports that would reduce their dependence on
aid.'
The inflow of dollars has led to an appreciation of the Ugandan shilling,
which is now overvalued. This has undermined donor-funded efforts at export
promotion and diversification. As the trade deficit widens, Uganda has
become more dependent on donors for balance of payments support.
Aid money is also feeding an industry of consultants. Virtually every
government ministry has a clutch of expatriate 'advisers'. Their standard
pay is Dollars 10,000 a month, or about 100 times the salary of a senior
Ugandan civil servant.
One official said he knew of an international firm of chartered accountants
who charged Dollars 200,000 for a report on accounting information systems
for the public sector. 'It was copied straight out of a first-year
accountancy text book,' he said. Its recommendations were not implemented.
Although most aid is being put to good use - building roads, repairing
hydroelectric dams, providing essential drugs - its abundance is breeding
corruption.
Diplomats in Kampala speak openly and disparagingly about government
ministers who are on the take.

U.N. RELIEF PLANE AND CREW RELEASED 




From Times staff and wire reports 




Ugandan authorities have released a U.N. relief plane, its two American pilots, 
two British passengers and three Kenyan crew members nearly three weeks after 
they were detained following an emergency landing in Uganda, officials said. 
Tarcis Kabwegyere, minister of state for foreign affairs, said the seven aboard 
and the aircraft, released Friday, are expected to leave for Nairobi today. The 
plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 in Kaabong, in northeastern Uganda, 
after running out of fuel in bad weather. It was trying to return to 
Lokichoggio, Kenya, after delivering emergency food and other supplies to 
southern Sudan.
