<HEAD>USGS Finds Hints Of Renewed Activity Beneath Medicine Lake Volcano</HEAD>

   A swarm of microearthquakes and
discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide
hints that California's dormant Medicine Lake Volcano might be
reawakening, scientists said Friday.
   However, there is no evidence an eruption is likely, U.S.
Geological Survey scientists said.
   ``It's suspicious enough to put in a new network (of seismic
monitors) but not suspicious enough to cause alarm,'' said John R.
Evans, a seismologist at the agency's western regional headquarters.
   ``If you identify a zone of molten magma beneath a volcano, that
obviously increases the potential for some future activity,'' said
geologist Bob Tilling, who headed the agency's response to the 1980
eruptions of Mount St. Helens. ``There's no evidence now for any
eruption at all. The only prudent thing is to keep monitoring it.''
   The evidence is ambiguous, so it's ``premature to suggest it
represents a reawakening of the volcano,'' said C. Dan Miller, a
geologist with the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Medicine Lake Volcano is a gently sloped volcano, about 20 miles
in diameter, in the southern Cascade Range about 35 miles northeast
of Mount Shasta, 60 miles north of Lassen Peak and roughly 280 miles
northeast of San Francisco. Medicine Lake, a recreational lake, sits
at an elevation of 6,674 feet on the floor of the volcano's
four-by-seven-mile crater, called a caldera.
   The nearest town, Tulelake, Calif., is 25 miles to the northeast.
   The volcano last erupted about 850 to 875 years ago, forming
small lava flows and cinder cones around several volcanic vents,
Miller said. Between 1,200 and 875 years ago, it had several
explosive eruptions, he said.
   Evans said the recent quakes, detection of the possible magma
chamber and a slight drop in the elevation of the caldera floor in
recent months may indicate magma is moving inside the mountain. But
Miller and Evans agreed the quakes also could have been caused by
non-volcanic stretching of the Earth's crust.
   The USGS installed six new seismometers after the single previous
seismometer detected a swarm of about 200 earthquakes Sept. 29 and
30, Evans said. Before then, only one earthquake, in October 1986,
had been detected at the volcano since the agency started monitoring
in 1981, geologist Steve Walter said.
   The September quakes were shallow and most were microearthquakes
measuring less than 2 on the Richter scale. Four exceeded magnitude
3, including one jolt that reached 4.2, Walter said. Three other
small quakes occurred Oct. 26 and Nov. 11 and 12, he added.
   Evidence for the small magma chamber just northeast of the lake
was found by Evans and geophysicists H. Mahadeva Iver and Phil
Dawson, using the shock xwaves of small explosions to make a picture
of the inside of the volcano.
   They found an area in which shock waves moved slowly, suggesting
they had moved through magma, Evans said. However, Miller said it
also is possible the waves were slowed by porous rock permeated by
hot water.
   The quakes ``may have recorded the intrusion of new magma into
this part of the volcano,'' Evans, Iyer and Dawson said in a study
presented at their agency's Geohazards '88 symposium
   The possible magma pool is small, measuring only about two cubic
miles, compared with a volume of about 200 cubic miles for the magma
chamber believed to be beneath the Long Valley caldera near Mammoth
Lakes, Calif., Evans said.
   Walter and Evans said USGS scientist Dan Dzurisin measured the
elevation of benchmarks on the volcano before the quakes, and found
the mountain had ``deflated'' by seven inches since the last
measurements in 1954. After the September quakes, it had fallen an
additional one-third inch.
   Such deflation suggests magma may have moved outward into cracks
in surrounding rocks, Evans said.
   A much higher level of such activity at Long Valley, along with
much bigger swarms of quakes in the early 1980s, failed to result in
any eruption there, Miller and Tilling said.

<HEADLINE>  HUGE ERUPTION LIKELY IN PHILIPPINES 'ANY
TIME'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano
today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology said.;    If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash
produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City, where the air base is
located, about 50 miles north of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not
erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at
least, Lipman said.;    Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the
eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he
said.;    The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark
Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near
the volcano.;    The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their
equipment, today  moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles
from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount
Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire"
on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes -- including
Mount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in
Washington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense
crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption,
600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half
a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until
volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath
the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.;    Other recent
volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and
Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption,
Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish
avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to
100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a
really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with
glowing ash, Lipman said.;    Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off
the avalanche is fatal. That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;   
Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base,
Lipman said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash --
indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their
engines stalled by the grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from
the base. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin
any day, would send ash directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity
-- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock
plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is
imminent, Lipman said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on
the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days
they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    Their predictions
might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already. But it
would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before
scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the
base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be
linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.;    "No reputable
scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.;   
More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted. "Two out of
500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Quakes Gets Subdued Response From Neighbors of Long Valley Volcano</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years after a volcano scare incited
fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are
nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is
triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes.
   Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic
eruption. But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so ``you
don't really think about it,'' said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.
   ``You can get hit by a car,'' she said. ``You can be in a plane
crash. The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of
being killed by an earthquake or a volcano.''
   ``People who are frightened left long ago. I don't believe it's
a conscious concern of anyone in the community,'' said Mammoth
Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper.
   The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley,
a 19-mile-long, 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera. It
is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles
north of Los Angeles. The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in
the region, allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers
under the caldera.
   The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most
powerful eruptions, a blast that spewed 600 times more material
than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.
   Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' happened 550
years ago at the Inyo craters, which span Long Valley's north rim,
and 650 years ago at the Mono craters, several miles north of the
caldera.
   Despite the current activity, the probability of a major
earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is ``less than 1
percent each year,'' said David Hill, the U.S. Geological Survey
geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley.
   Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates ``a
scientific guessing game,'' and said area residents rarely discuss
the latest swarm of earthquakes, which started in May 1989.
   That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety, denial
and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the
Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984.
   During that period, subterranean molten rock pushed upward,
lifting the caldera's floor. As a result, the Geological Survey
issued a ``notice of potential volcanic hazard'' for Long Valley in
May 1982.
   That warning, coupled with jarring earthquakes, damaged tourism
and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market.
   ``The community overreacted,'' Murphy said. Residents accused
journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and
denounced scientists for scaring people.
   ``Initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get
funding from Congress,'' Alper said.
   The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered
Geological Survey changed its warning system and seismic activity
diminished, reducing the possibility of an eruption.
   Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and
continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, Lee Vining and other
Mono County resort towns. The temblors, most measuring 1 to 3 on
the Richter scale, started beneath Mammoth Mountain. In September
1989, they shifted to the caldera, where five to 10 small quakes
now happen daily.
   A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the
region last Tuesday, tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's
roads. It was eastern California's largest quake since 1984, but
wasn't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms,
Hill said.
   Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock
moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the
caldera, he said. The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979,
including 3 inches in the past year.
   While Long Valley ``is clearly an area that's showing unrest,
large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades
without necessarily erupting,'' Hill said.
   The floor of a caldera near Naples, Italy, rose 9 feet between
1970 and 1984 but didn't erupt. Comparable uplift inside a New
Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster.
   Nevertheless, Hill said, eastern Sierra residents are addressing
the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and
helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a
warning if an eruption appeared likely.

VOLCANIC ACTIVITY SLOWLY BUILDING A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE IN THE PACIFIC;

<TEXT>
<P>
The mysterious geologic forces behind the current eruptions of Mt. Kilauea are 
quietly creating the newest piece of America. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing with agonizing slowness from the warm tropical waters just southeast 
of the Big Island of Hawaii is an undersea mountain named Loihi. Volcanologists 
believe Loihi eventually could emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island. 
</P>
<P>
"Loihi has grown about 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor," Thomas L. Wright, 
scientist-in-charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said. "It seems to be 
tapping the same source of magma (lava still underground) as Kilauea. Loihi 
needs about 3,100 more feet to break the surface." 
</P>
<P>
The observatory, on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera, or lava lake, is 
operated by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Volcanoes have been creating and modifying the environment over eons of 
geologic time. More than 80% of Earth's surface is of volcanic origin. Volcanic 
eruptions have formed fertile soils and sculpted mountains, plateaus and other 
majestic landscapes. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents helped to form the 
early atmosphere and oceans where scientists believe life first emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The volcanic machine powering Kilauea and building Loihi may represent the most 
visible and most persistent example of this little-known facet of volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
Kilauea has been in the news time and again since it resumed erupting on Jan. 
3, 1983. Lava oozing at the rate of 635,000 cubic feet each day has traveled 20 
miles east to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Lava flowing from the eruption, 50 feet thick in some places, already has 
torched 140 houses and caused more than $60 million in damage. Last May 5, a 
2,000-foot-wide flow cut off an entire village on the island's southeast coast, 
and Gov. John D. Waihee declared the town a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
These highly publicized lava flows, and those silently lifting Loihi toward the 
surface, result from the peculiar form of volcanic activity occurring in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 500 active surface volcanoes on Earth straddle the margins of 
continents and the huge plates of rock that fit together like pieces of a 
jigsaw puzzle to make up the planet's surface. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen of these plates, each of which is about 50 miles thick. 
The plates move relative to each other a few inches a year. Active volcanoes 
tend to occur in zones of under-thrusting, or "subduction," where one plate is 
slipping beneath another. 
</P>
<P>
How can volcanic activity occur in the Hawaiian Islands, which are more than 
2,000 miles from the nearest plate margin? 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian volcanoes are believed to result from a different phenomenon termed 
"hot spot" volcanism. Geologists theorize that deep under the Pacific plate is 
an exquisitely hot, stationary region termed the "Hawaiian hot spot." 
</P>
<P>
Like a propane torch placed under a moving sheet of plastic, the hot spot melts 
rock in the overriding Pacific plate. The molten rock, or magma, is less dense 
than surrounding solid rock and rises through fractures to spill onto the 
surface or ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
Over about 70 million years, the continuous movement of the Pacific plate over 
this stationary "fountain of fire" left a trail of more than 80 big volcanoes 
over the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Called the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamount 
Chain, the islands and undersea mountains, or seamounts, stretch northwestward 
about 4,000 miles, from the Big Island of Hawaii to the Kamchatka Peninsula in 
Soviet territory. 
</P>
<P>
The five main Hawaiian islands are the tops of volcanic mountains that were 
formed as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
A scientific record of the plate's movement to the northwest is evident in the 
age of solidified lava left on each of the islands. The age decreases from 
northwest to southeast. Kauai, in the extreme northwest, is 5.6 million years 
old; Oahu is 3.4 million; Molokai is 1.8 million, Maui is 800,000, Hawaii is 
under 700,000 years old. Lava ages even decrease in the same 
northwest-to-southeast fashion on each individual island. 
</P>
<P>
Continued movement of the Pacific plate promises to give the goddess Pele a new 
home and Hawaii a new island. 
</P>
<P>
If theories about hot spot volcanism are correct, plate movement eventually 
will carry the Big Island off the Hawaiian hot spot. The two active volcanoes 
on the island, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, will become extinct. The hot spot then 
will pour molten rock onto the surface through the next volcano in the Hawaiian 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know exactly when Loihi will emerge as a new island. Assuming 
Loihi's growth continues at current rates, it could take from a few thousand to 
a few tens of thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
But other fates also may await the infant volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Infusions of molten rock from the hot spot, for instance, may cease 
unexpectedly. Loihi's growth would be stunted, leaving it just another seamount 
in the chain. The ninth Hawaiian island thus may form in an entirely different 
place. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the possibility a sudden major undersea eruption could raise 
Loihi to the surface sooner than anyone expects. 
</P>

the same fires deep in the Earth that burst forth here are behind the formation

tiny to be felt.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GEOLOGISTS, MAMMOTH LAKES PEOPLE UNFAZED
BY LATEST 'SWARM' OF QUAKES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     By this week, the number of quakes diminished to an average of five daily.
That is still two to three times as many as during previous months, according
to a weekly report issued by the Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    Mammoth
Lakes -- with about 4,700 permanent residents and thousands of tourists -- is
located inside the Long Valley caldera, a volcanic crater 19 miles long and 9
miles wide. The area is 150 miles east of San Jose.;    The volcano "continues
to show unrest and has the potential of erupting at some point," said David
Hill, the USGS geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley. "But we see
no reason to worry over the short run.";    Long Valley and other volcanic
calderas around the world go through decades of episodic quake activity
without erupting.;    "From that, and based on our knowledge of the geological
history of eruptions in the area, we think the chances of an eruption in any
given year are very small, less than a tenth of a percent or so," Hill said
during a telephone interview.;    Between March 23 and Thursday, 1,122 quakes
were detected near Mammoth Lakes.;    Hill said the quakes probably are caused
by increased pressure inside one of the chambers of molten rock, called magma,
located beneath the caldera.;    The increased pressure could be caused either
because more molten rock is being injected into the magma chamber or because
some of the molten rock is crystallizing as it cools, releasing steam and
other gases, he added.;    California's five-year drought hurt the area's ski
business. The quake swarm started just after heavy snow in March brought an
influx of skiers to the resort town. However, most residents and visitors "are
taking it in stride," Hill said.;    "If you're skiing, you probably don't
feel a thing," said USGS geophysicist John Langbein.;    The Long Valley
caldera was created about 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most powerful
eruptions. The blast spewed 600 times more volcanic debris and ash than the
May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.;    Eruptions
somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' occurred about 650 years ago at the
Mono craters, several miles north of the caldera, and about 550 years ago at
the Inyo craters, which span the caldera's north rim.;    Scientists believe
two or three chambers of molten rock, each perhaps 1 1/2 miles wide, are now
located beneath the caldera and the Inyo-Mono craters, at depths ranging from
4 miles to 6 miles.;    From 1979 to 1984, the area was rocked by thousands of
quakes, including several strong jolts exceeding magnitude 6 on the Richter
scale. Molten rock pushed upward, making the caldera's floor bulge.;    The
activity prompted the Geological Survey to issue a "notice of potential
volcanic hazard" for Long Valley in May 1982, drawing harsh criticism from
local business people who blamed the scare for aggravating a recession in
tourism and real estate.;    The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 when
quake activity diminished and the agency revised its warning system.;    Quake
swarms resumed under the Mammoth Mountain ski area, on the west edge of the
caldera, in May 1989. The quake activity shifted to the caldera's southern
edge in late 1989 and has continued sporadically since then.;    The swarm
that started last month is the biggest since 1989, Hill said.;    But it
hasn't been accompanied by any increase in upward bulging of the caldera's
floor. The floor has bulged upward about two feet since 1979, but is now
rising at a rate of only three-quarters of an inch annually, Hill said.;   
Hill said scientists are confident they would recognize signs of an imminent
eruption: a sharp increase in bulging and quakes that generate "harmonic
tremor," which indicates large-scale underground movement of molten rock.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>`Hot Spot' Forms Hawaii Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the
volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing
it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific
process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago.
   Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island
by her sister and nemesis, Na Maka o Kahai, goddess of the sea. In
reality, the ``chase'' was the formation of the islands, part of a
900-mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the Pacific
plate for 70 million years.
   These volcanic islands were formed after passing over a ``hot
spot'' in the Earth's mantle that remains in a fixed location under
the plate, said Reggie Okamura, who has studied volcanoes at the
U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for 32 years.
   This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it,
creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through
the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips
eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said. These
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping
contours.
   ``The process that's happening now pretty much is what happened
earlier to form the other islands,'' Okamura said.
   The Pacific plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about
four inches a year, Okamura said. Each island _ beginning with
Kauai and Niihau and followed by Oahu, Molokai, Lanai and Maui and
Hawaii _ were active volcanoes at one time.
   A large portion of Hawaii Island, the youngest in the chain,
currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at Kilauea, which has
been in continuous eruption since 1983. About 160 acres of new land
have been created as a result, Okamura said.
   Three of Hawaii Island's five volcanoes have been active in the
last 200 years. The other two, which already have passed over the
hot spot, have been dormant for 3,000 and 6,000 years, respectively.
   Scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of Hawaii
Island and is about 600 feet below the surface. When it breaks sea
level, thousands of years from now, Loihi will be the newest
Hawaiian island, Okamura said.
   The process that forms Hawaii's volcanoes is different from the
one that forms volcanoes on the continental United States, such as
Mount St. Helens, which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption
in 1980.
   The Cascade range that includes Mount St. Helens was formed by
the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate with the North American
Continental plate. As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into
the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized
magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.
   While lava from Hawaii's volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of
feet into the air, it's unlikely enough pressure could be built up
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at Mount St. Helens, he
said.
   Magma _ called lava only after it reaches the surface _ moves
through the island's volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents. The
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools, thickens
and stops moving. The rest of the lava continues to pass under it.
   The tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills.
Most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as
rift zones. Lava also can flow over the volcano's crater, or
caldera, Okamura said.
   There are two kinds of lava _ pahoehoe and a'a _ identical in
chemical composition. Pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and
swift-moving. A'a lava is rougher, more fragmented and
slower-moving. Most lava erupts as pahoehoe, with some changing to
a'a as its temperature and gas content decrease. The lava mainly is
composed of silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium and
other minerals, Okamura said.

   Scientists took samples of gritty ash
from the flanks of Mount St. Helens in hopes of learning whether
the volcano's latest burst will bring more explosive activity.
   Three scientists got within 12 miles of the crater on the east
flanks of the 8,366-foot mountain Sunday to gather ash from the
largest explosion in nearly four years.
   Dan Dzurisin, acting scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, said the ash appeared to be pulverized
material from previously erupted lava.
   If an examination by microscope shows the ash is from a new
surge of magma or molten rock beneath the volcano, however, it
could be a sign of more explosions to come, Dzurisin said.
   Scientists also planned to fly in a helicopter over the crater
to determine whether there was an avalanche from the lava dome in
the eruption Saturday morning. Dense clouds prevented a flight
Sunday, Dzurisin said.
   The latest eruption, which came without preceding earthquakes,
sent ash as far as 90 miles to the east and destroyed two
seismometers and two tilt meters in the crater. No injuries were
reported.
   Seismographs and other equipment recorded the two-minute
explosion beginning at 5:37 a.m. Saturday. After a couple of hours
of small earthquakes beneath the volcano, seismic activity subsided
to normal levels, Dzurisin said.
   In the past few months, there have twice been lesser bursts from
the volcano. On Aug. 24, there was a minor eruption with no ashfall
detected. On Dec. 8, ashfall was limited to the crater.
   An eruption like Saturday's, without the small earthquakes in
advance to give a warning, is ``relatively new to us,'' Dzurisin
said.
   It was the most significant explosion since a series of small
explosions spit ash in the spring of 1986, he said.
   U.S. Forest Service and Wapato police officials received dozens
of calls Saturday, reporting light dustings of a fine, gritty,
gray-white ash in and around Yakima in the south-central part of
the state. Yakima is about 80 miles from the volcano.
   The volcano's last significantly large eruption was on March 19,
1982, when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork
of the Toutle River, he said.
   The last dome-building eruption, a more quiet process in which
molten rock pushes upward to swell the huge mound of cooling lava
in the crater, was in 1986.
   Studying the recent ashfall could indicate whether the eruption
was part of a ``last gasp'' or the start of a more explosive phase
in the volcanic activity that began in March 1980, Dzurisin said.
   The cataclysmic explosion of May 18, 1980, leveled 230 square
miles, killed 57 people and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe. It also blew off the top 1,300 feet of the peak.

   Scientists plan to install a $4 million
observatory on an underwater volcano, complete with cameras,
microphones and seismometers to monitor the gradual birth of the
next Hawaiian island.
   University of Hawaii researchers hope the Hawaiian Undersea
Geo-Observatory, or HUGO, will be in place on Loihi seamount within
two years, using its instruments to study earthquakes and
eruptions, geology and geophysics professor Fred K. Duennebier said
Wednesday.
   ``It's a good idea to monitor undersea volcanoes,'' said Bob
Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist. ``More than half
the world's volcanoes are on the sea floor. The challenge is to
capture one of these erupting because we haven't done that yet.''
   Loihi is a rugged, steep-sided submarine volcano about 22 miles
southeast of the Island of Hawaii. It rises roughly 11,200 feet
above the surrounding sea floor. Its cratered summit is now about
3,300 feet beneath the surface of the Pacific, Duennebier said.
   Volcanologists are certain it is active but haven't actually
observed an eruption. Intense earthquake activity suggests
eruptions happened in 1986, 1988 and early this year, Duennebier
said during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   ``It will be the next Hawaiian island in about 50,000 years or
so'' once eruptions build the summit above the ocean's surface, he
added. ``I wouldn't buy real estate yet.''
   The observatory will be a network of 20 or more cameras and
instruments plugged into electrical boxes located on a system of
electro-optical cables draped across Loihi's summit and slopes -
like TVs, lamps and stereo equipment linked by extension cords in
someone's living room.
   HUGO will be connected to the Big Island by another cable that
will provide power and also carry data from the observatory to a
recording station and scientists on shore.
   Duennebier said that once a ship lays the cable and boxes,
unmanned remote-controlled submarines and manned submersible
vehicles will plug cameras, microphones, seismometers and heat and
chemical sensors into the network.
   Scientists who study the sea floor now usually use instruments
that are dropped off ships, fall to the ocean floor, record
scientific data on tape and then are recovered by ships.
   Duennebier said HUGO's instruments will have the advantage of
being able to collect data on quakes and eruptions and send the
information to land immediately. If a camera or instrument breaks
down or becomes obsolete, a submersible vehicle or
remote-controlled submarine can retrieve it and install a new one.
   The observatory will be able to collect pictures and information
for at least 10 years unless it is buried by undersea lava flows or
landslides, Duennebier said. He said the instruments would be
placed in areas where they are least likely to be damaged.
   During the apparent eruption of Loihi in 1986, the university
installed seven temporary seismometers on Loihi's slopes. They
detected thousands of earthquakes at the rate of about three daily,
while seismometers on land detected only three per month.
Duennebier said that shows the value of installing a permanent
observatory like HUGO.
   The Hawaiian Islands were created by a ``hot spot,'' a plume of
molten rock that rises from deep inside the Earth. As a giant plate
of Earth's crust was dragged over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions
from the hot spot formed each of the islands in succession.
   Loihi is now over the hot spot, which also has branches feeding
Hawaii's Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes.
   The network of cables and electrical plug-in boxes for the
observatory will cost roughly $4 million, although about two-thirds
of that cost has been donated by AT&amp;T Co. in the form of 25 miles
of undersea cable and the use of a cable-laying ship to install it.
   The university also got $100,000 of $2.5 million it requested
for the project from the National Science Foundation. Duennebier
and his colleague, oceanographer Alexander Malahoff, hope to use
that money to start buying cameras and monitoring instruments for
the observatory.
   Because the observatory will be equipped with numerous plug-in
boxes, many other researchers will be able to install their own
instruments on Loihi, Duennebier said.

<TEXT>     The Mount Pinatubo volcano was slowly rousing from 600 years of sleep.;   
Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about
this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the
hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks.;    They didn't know
it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption
of Mount St. Helens in Washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions
had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base.;    But with the first small
signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments
around the restless mountain. And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation,
they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people.;    The
warning came just in time. A series of violent eruptions has rocked the
mountain since Wednesday, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and
sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away. At least 101 people have
been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in Manila and
20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated
from the country. U.S. officials said the damage may lead them to permanently
close Clark Air Base.;    On Monday, scientists said much of the pressure
inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over.;    Although
Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the
damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and
pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation.
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has
come in the past decade.;    The basics are the same. Researchers still use
seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and
bulging of the ground that often spell danger.;    But the technology has
improved immensely:;    (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable,
so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path
of the volcano's fury.;    (check) The instruments continually beam data to
scientists who are waiting a safe distance away. Before, they had to visit
their instruments and collect the data by hand.;    (check) Information is
routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation
quickly -- and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of
volcanoes.;    Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they
see. "Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said Peter Lipman, a
volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    These skills
were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the
past decade.;    "The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the
number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring
information," said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades
Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. "It was a rather remarkable decade,
really.";    Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57
people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in
volcano research.;    It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and
prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and
monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park.;    As a
result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories. One, in Washington,
keeps track of active volcanoes in the Cascades Range of the Pacific Northwest
and Northern California, including Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount
Hood, Mount Baker, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen. The second is in Alaska,
where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in 1989 and 1990. A third
observatory has been operating in Hawaii since 1912.;    American scientists
have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world,
from Galunggung in Indonesia to Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, improving their
ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. Such a quick response is crucial
because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been
adequately investigated and monitored.;    "Now," Tilling said, "we can go in
there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data
within a day or two.";    The blossoming research has in turn spurred
development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.;    Take tiltmeters.;   
Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and
tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.;    A
decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each. But after Mount St. Helens
blew, scientists looked for cheaper models. One was developed by James
Westphal, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the California Institute of
Technology, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems.
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped
out in eruptions.;    The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as
scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.;    "Volcanoes are
probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said
Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park.;    It's not unusual
for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes -- but those quakes can
have a variety of causes. Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock
above pools of magma that, for the moment, aren't going anywhere. But others
are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation
for an eruption.;    In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have
learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt
Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.;    But even
though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake
forecasts, they're far from foolproof.;    Some volcanoes give virtually no
warning. Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and
expensive. In the Philippines, for instance, vandals looted parts of Clark Air
Base that were left unguarded. Factories and businesses shut down; crops and
livestock were left unattended.;    This time the evacuation paid off,
possibly averting a number of deaths. But it won't always. In the end, every
volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity.
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to
sleep.;    The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on
scientists.;    Randall White, another seismologist with the USGS in Menlo
Park, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of
Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz six years ago.;    Struggling to hear their
instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues
warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. But their warnings
were vain. For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an
evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting
glaciers and forming devastating mudslides.;    "I found it nerve-racking,"
White said. "We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that
some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data) wrong, and
a lot of people would die.";  Tools give clues that can save lives;    The
basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were
10 years ago. Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that
continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer. This
allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards -- and forecasts that can save
lives.; 1. Surveying: Researchers measure the volcano, with optical
instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as
a result of magma rising inside. They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's
vent to record changes in the slope of the ground.; 2. Pick and shovel:
Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a
volcano erupted in the past -- a clue to what it might do in the future. The
thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption.; 3.
Seismometer: Measures ground shaking. Volcanoes often produce swarms of small
earthquakes. Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from
those caused by magma rising toward the surface -- a sign of impending
eruption.; 4. Spectrometer: First developed to measure pollutants from factory
smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke
belched by volcanoes. Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending
eruption. The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano,
and thus the potential size of the eruption.;    Sources: Robert Tilling and

   Molten rock moving beneath California's
Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small
earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old
volcano is unlikely to erupt.
   ``We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's
much more sporadic'' in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of
tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053-foot mountain in the Sierra
Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge
of monitoring the situation.
   In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: ``While
eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm
cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world
suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended
period of relative quiescence.''
   Hill discussed the ``swarm'' of quakes under Mammoth Mountain
during a Monday session at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Only four of the thousands of quakes that started May 4 measured
more than 3 on the Richter scale, so most were too small to be
felt. Some of the quakes were only 1.5 miles deep and often came in
rapid-fire bursts.
   Mammoth Mountain has bulged upward about one-half inch since
May, Hill said.
   The most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that
molten rock, or magma, is being squeezed into a vertical crack that
extends from 3.5 miles to 6 miles below Mammoth Mountain's south
flank, he said.
   This sheetlike intrusion is called a dike, and excavations at
many old volcanoes reveal that most dikes never erupt to the
surface, Hill explained.
   Mammoth Mountain, now covered with ski runs, last erupted
explosively about 50,000 years ago and is located just outside the
southwest rim of Long Valley caldera. The caldera is a
20-by-10-mile oval-shaped crater created 730,000 years ago by one
of the world's greatest eruptions.
   That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May
18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.
   The resort town of Mammoth Lakes sits inside the caldera a few
miles east of Mammoth Mountain. Hill cautioned against undue
volcano phobia, saying it is ``more dangerous to drive up on U.S.
395 than to spend time skiing or living near Mammoth Lakes.''

   A volcano erupted near an uninhabited island today,
spewing plumes of steam and smoke into the air and raising concerns
about a region of the nation where thousands of earthquakes have
occurred recently.
   The eruption happened at 6:30 p.m. about 1{ miles northeast of
the island of Teishijima, the Central Meteorological Agency reported.
   The island is just off the coast of Ito city on the Izu
peninsula, 60 miles southwest of Tokyo. The extent of the volcanic
activity several hundred yards beneath the ocean's surface was not
immediately known, the agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, and a tsunami, or
seismic wave caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity, was not
expected, the agency said. However, it issued a navigation warning
to ships operating in the area.
   Many people in Ito, a seaside spa known for its many hot springs,
were seen leaving their homes, but no evacuation order was issued,
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said. Hundreds of people called local
officials asking about the volcano.
   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, larger
eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further
warnings,'' said a Central Meteorological Agency official who
requested anonymity. ``Obviously, there could be danger to Ito if a
larger eruption occurs.''
   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu over
the past two weeks, and officials from the Construction Ministry's
Geographical Survey Institute began today to check movement of the
earth's crust at Ito, the town nearest the epicenter. Ito has a
population of 72,000.
   Also seismologists from the University of Tokyo started surveying
the movements of underground magma with monitoring equipment in Ito.
   The stepped-up investigations followed an emergency meeting late
Wednesday of the government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake
Prediction, which called for ``careful monitoring'' of the
continuing earthquakes.
   The 16-member committee, led by Professor Daisuke Shimozuru of
the University of Tokyo, said in a statement that the successive
minor quakes occurring since Tuesday night ``may be caused by
activities of underground magma, and there is a need to monitor them
carefully.''
   Two million people visited Ito last year, where there are 450
inns and hotels for visitors, Hidekatsu Takei, acting director of
the Hot Spring Tourist Cooperatives in Ito, told The Associated
Press.

   At 4.1 on the Richter scale, the earthquake on
the afternoon of March 20, 1980, was no great shakes. It knocked
snow off the north face of Mount St. Helens but went virtually
unnoticed in the surrounding counties of southwestern Washington.
   Nearly 130 miles to the north, the line traced by a wandering
pencil on a seismograph at the University of Washington was first
interpreted as evidence of a tremor 75 miles southeast of the
dormant volcano.
   But on closer inspection, seismologists determined the quake had
occurred under the mountain, and relatively close to the surface.
   It was the first recorded sign that Mount St. Helens' volcanic
fuse was lit. One week later, on March 27, the volcano belched
steam and ash in its first eruption in 123 years. The accompanying
4.7-magnitude quake sent seismic needles skittering.
   Fifty-two days after that, on May 18, 1980, the mountain
exploded spectacularly. The eruption killed 57 people and sent ash
around the world. In an instant, 1,300 feet of the mountain
disappeared, fully a fifth of its towering majesty simply blown
away.
   The smoking, raw-edged crater left behind stunned residents of
Washington and Oregon used to gazing out at a symmetrical,
snowcapped peak.
   ``It woke people up to the fact that having a volcano in your
back yard can be dangerous,'' said Dwight Crandell, retired from
the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1978, Crandell helped write a report
that predicted an eruption at Mount St. Helens this century.
   The blast was also a wake-up call for volcanologists around the
world. In the 1970s, only two countries with volcanic mountains
were examining the dangers of nearby human settlements. Today 16
countries have active studies under way, Crandell said by telephone
from his home in Denver.
   ``It's clear that the 1980 eruption was a sensation for the
science of volcanology,'' said geologist Steve Brantley, stationed
at the USGS Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., about
45 miles southwest of Mount St. Helens. About 80 scientists work at
the observatory, built after the eruption.
   UW seismologist Steve Malone said the March 20 earthquake was
strong enough to draw attention to the area but not so unusual as
to make scientists suspicious that molten rock was squeezing into
crevices deep under the earth.
   ``Earthquakes at the volcano are not unheard of,'' Malone said.
``They generate a bit of interest but not immediate alarm.''
   But quakes kept coming, increasing in number and strength. Three
days after the initial quake, UW seismologists warned the USGS
about a ``potentially serious situation.''
   ``This was when we first suspected we might be on to something
other than just a small earthquake swarm,'' Malone said.
   Teams of geologists arrived to set up equipment to monitor
ground movement and the gases emitted each time the volcano burped.
Seismologists stayed close to their machines. The Forest Service
began warning people to stay clear of the mountain because of
avalanches.
   But the scientists were not working in isolation. Scores of
eager newspaper and broadcast reporters joined the crush.
Researchers accustomed to working in geologic time, in a science
where more is unknown than known, were being asked to provide
instant answers for that evening's news and the next morning's
newspapers.
   ``I remember ... being a bit overwhelmed by the media interest
this was already generating,'' Malone said. ``All we had was data
and some possibilities and a lot of questions.''
   Meantime, the ground was moving at postcard-perfect Spirit Lake,
at the mountain's foot. Chuck Tonn, who ran the Forest Service desk
at the lake, hung a pencil from a string to show the faint shaking.
The lake was evacuated Tuesday morning, March 25.
   ``I was glad to leave that morning,'' Tonn said. ``That last
night, I don't think any of us slept. ... It seemed like there was
always some movement going on.''
   Not everyone left. Harry Truman, the 83-year-old owner and
keeper of rustic Spirit Lake Lodge, dug in his heels. Truman said
he would stay on the mountain that had been his home for 50 years,
the mountain that eight weeks later would kill him. In the media
catering to the nation's rising anticipation, Truman became a
cantankerous folk hero.
   Another local, Stan Lee, 67, owner of the Kid Valley Store about
20 miles from the peak, snorted at talk of a possible eruption and
accused the Forest Service of plotting to squelch development. Two
days later, the mountain blew.
   That first eruption shot a black plume almost a mile and a half
high. By mid-April, the stark gray and brown hollow of a crater had
replaced the mountain's snowy point, once 9,677 feet above sea
level. Ashfalls in the region were commonplace, with fickle winds
determining who got dusted next.
   May 18, 1980, the day the mountain finally blew its top, is now
designated Eruption Day in Geological Survey books. On those who
were there and experienced the power and awe and terror, Mount St.
Helens has left its mark as clearly as the eruption scarred the
landscape.
   ``I feel fortunate to have been at Mount St. Helens from the
beginning all these 10 years,'' said Tonn, who now manages the
Forest Service's visitors' center west of the 110,000-acre National
Volcanic Monument.
   ``It (eruption) kind of puts me in my place. It puts me in awe
of what can happen.''
   For Crandell and fellow USGS geologist Donal Mullineaux, the
eruption was right on time. After studying dormant Cascade Range
volcanoes in the 1960s and 1970s, they predicted in 1978 that Mount
St. Helens would likely erupt relatively soon.
   ``Everything we found indicated it was a very young volcano, and
a very explosive volcano, and a frequently active volcano,'' which
last erupted in 1857, Crandell said. ``We felt almost sure the
volcano would erupt, and sooner rather than later. That is what the
history told us.''
   While some public officials greeted their hazard report
seriously, there were also snickers, the two scientists said. ``A
lot of people made fun of it, of course,'' Mullineaux said.
   Crandell said he was gratified that many countries with
volcanoes have since made use of their work in hazard assessment,
including New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Equador and Colombia.
   The eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz in November 1985
provides an example of how hazard assessment could have helped,
Crandell said. An assessment had been completed, and hazard zones
had been laid out, including likely flood and mudflow zones at the
town of Armero. But word never reached local officials. There were
no evacuations and 25,000 people perished.
   Mount St. Helens prompted gains in both volcanology and
seismology. Since 1980, scientists have learned to better predict
volcanic eruptions by studying earthquake activity, including the
``harmonic tremors'' that indicate movement of molten earth.
   Other volcanic mysteries are also better understood, Crandell
said. These include the devastating sideways force of the May 1980
eruption, the fast-moving and deadly mixtures of matter and gas
known as pyroclastic flows and surges, and the mudflows that let
loose in minutes after vibrations turn snowfields into walls of
water.
   Mullineaux and Crandell retired in the mid-1980s, but both
remain active in research on Mount St. Helens.
   ``I can't leave it alone,'' Crandell said.

   A giant ash plume belched from Mount St. Helens,
but scientists said it didn't appear to portend a new eruption of
molten rock.
   Wind carred the ash toward Portland, Ore., 53 miles to the
southwest, prompting United Airlines to cancel 21 flights in and
out of that city Thursday night. Normal service was to resume this
morning, United customer service supervisor Fred Von Pegert said.
   Port of Portland spokesman Darrel Buttice said the airport
remained open Thursday night and the 11 other airlines were flying.
   The 8,366-foot mountain blew a column of light gray ash and
steam 23,000 feet into the air Thursday afternoon, about 30 minutes
after a small explosion occurred on the lava dome in the volcano's
crater, said Michael Doukas, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
its Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver.
   Doukas said it was similar to the latest volcanic ``burp,'' on
Nov. 5, when a plume of steam and ash rose 30,000 feet into the
sky. Similar bursts occurred last December and January.
   Doukas said those bursts are significant only in underscoring
that Mount St. Helens remains an active volcano.
   Scientists have theorized such bursts come from either gases
bubbling out of solution in molten rock beneath the mountain, or
from rain and snowmelt percolating down to hot areas and bursting
into steam.
   The volcano's last significant eruption was on March 19, 1982,
when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork of the
Toutle River. Since then, the mountain has had a series of
``dome-building'' eruptions in which the mountain quietly adds lava
to the heap in its crater. The last of those was in October 1986.
   The mountain's cataclysmic May 18, 1980, eruption killed 57
people and blew off the top 1,300 feet of the once-symmetrical
peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th century.

   The strongest earthquake to hit Hawaii in
six years shook a sparsely populated area of Hawaii Island already
ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal
wave.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes
Monday, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   ``Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' Kim said.
``Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.''
   The temblor, caused by the 6{-year-old eruption of Kilauea
Volcano, struck Sunday evening and measured 6.1 on the Richter
scale, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   It was centered west of Kalapana, a small coastal town on the
south flank of the volcano, said Bruce Turner, a geophysicist at the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.
   The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by
the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said Bob
Koyanagi, a seismic analyst at the Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory.
   Reggie Okamura, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists
had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on
the Richter scale, was recorded Sunday night, he said.
   Kilauea lava has destroyed 68 homes in the Kalapana area since
its latest eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Four homes were destroyed in
May, and last Thursday a Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitor
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure.
   Koyanagi said pressure became too great within the world's most
active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the
earthquake.
   The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at Honuapo, 8.4
inches at Kapoho and 5.6 inches at Hilo, caused no damage, Turner
said.
   Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none
required hospitalization, Kim said. Crews were working to repair
downed power lines.
   It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since Nov. 15,
1983, when a 6.6 temblor caused several million dollars damage on
Hawaii Island.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

   Yusaku Inoue, sitting quietly Friday on the
stairs in front of his tiny beachfront restaurant, sighed deeply and
said, ``It looks like my summer is over.''
   The 85-year-old restaurant owner was among hundreds of shop
owners, hotel managers and restaurant operators in Ito, 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, whose business has been hurt by thousands of
earthquakes and the eruption of an undersea volcano.
   ``I have been running this place for over 40 years and business
was never this bad,'' he said.
   Since June 30, more than 22,000 quakes have jolted the hot
springs resort, including more than 585 strong enough to be felt by
humans. Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two
earthquakes registering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.
   On Thursday evening, a volcano onthe ocean floor off Ito erupted,
spewing white steam into the air.
   The hundreds of hotels in the area are virtually empty, although
some of the rooms are being filled by reporters.
   ``The irony is that this town earned its fame from its rich hot
springs derived from volcanic activity,'' said one middle-aged shop
owner, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now, the volcanic
activity is hurting the tourism industry.''
   More earthquakes and volcanic tremors jolted the Ito area on
Friday, but no injuries were reported. Scores of dead fish and
volcanic stones were scattered along the shore.
   ``On an ordinary Friday afternoon, this beach is always packed
and most restaurants around here are full,'' said Inoue. ``But I've
only had one customer so far today.''
   News reports Friday said two undersea mounds were found near the
eruption site, a few miles from Ito. One was about 80 feet high and
the other about 30 feet, the reports said.
   Most of the 200 people who left their seaside houses after the
eruption to spend the night in four Buddhist temples and schools
returned home Friday, but 43 schools in Ito remained closed, said
Masaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesman for the city.
   The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction
said another eruption was highly likely to occur, not only at the
same spot but possibly at other locations.
   When the 72,000 residents began to experience temblors in recent
weeks, its 916 hotels and inns began receiving a stream of
cancellations. After the eruption Thursday, more than 95 percent of
hotel reservations were canceled, said Hiroyuki Yamashita of Ito's
tourist bureau.
   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, Mount
Tokachi, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, erupted several
times.

   A volcano at the bottom of the Pacific that
is destined to be the next Hawaiian island is going high-tech with
a $4 million network of cameras and seismic sensors to document its
deep-sea rumblings.
   ``We would love to catch an eruption,'' Fred K. Duennebier, a
professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii,
said Wednesday of the Hawaiian Undersea Geo-Observatory.
   The observatory will be installed on Loihi seamount, an
underwater volcano 22 miles southeast of the island of Hawaii.
Loihi rises about 11,200 feet above the ocean floor, but its
cratered summit is still 3,300 feet beneath the waves.
   ``It will be the next Hawaiian island in about 50,000 years or
so,'' Duennebier said at a meeting the American Geophysical Union.
``I wouldn't buy real estate yet.''
   The observatory, which scientists hope to have in operation
within two years, will be a network of 20 or more cameras and
instruments draped across Loihi's summit and slopes.
   HUGO will be connected to the Big Island by a power cable that
will also carry data from the observatory to scientists on shore.
   A ship will lay a network of electro-optical cable and outlet
boxes, then remote-controlled submarines and manned submersible
vehicles will plug in cameras, microphones, seismometers and heat
and chemical sensors.
   It will work for at least 10 years unless it is buried by lava
flows or landslides, Duennebier said.
   Scientists are sure Loihi is active but haven't actually
observed an eruption. Intense earthquake activity suggests
eruptions happened in 1986, 1988 and early this year, Duennebier
said.
   The Hawaiian Islands were created by a ``hot spot,'' a plume of
molten rock that rises from deep inside the Earth. Loihi is now
over the hot spot, which also has branches feeding Hawaii's active
Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanos.
   Roughly 60 percent to 80 percent of the world's volcanos are on
the sea floor.
   ``We have no idea how these volcanos are built up from the ocean
floor,'' Duennebier said. ``We don't know how the lava actually
makes it to the top of the volcano.''

   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.

<LEADPARA>  The cool-headed "guerrilla seismologist" from Menlo Park whose accurate
predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives
in the Philippines is right where he wants to be -- a cramped bunker a dozen
miles from the exploding volcano.;    One of only a handful of volcano
seismologists in the world, David Harlow, 47, is known as an Indiana Jones of
volcanoes, jumping at the chance to get close enough to pick up the bumps and
tremors that signal an impending eruption and thriving on the high-pressure
decision-making that goes with making predictions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "He's someone who eats it up," said Randy White, Harlow's friend and
colleague at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "He's able to totally
concentrate in those sorts of situations.";    The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo
finally gave Harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving
lives. When Harlow went to Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980,
geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes.
Bureaucratic delays kept Harlow from arriving at Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia
until a day after its 1985 eruption. Harlow and his team predicted the 1989
eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the
remote area.;    Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological
Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast
the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One
crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its
potential power.;    Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs
around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly
pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption
is imminent.;    Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past
six weeks. Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas,
the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more
than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the
narrow valleys west of the volcano.;    Philippine and U.S. Air Force
officials ordered evacuations Monday.;    Since late Tuesday, Harlow's
colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the
bunker at Clark Air Base, but do not believe the team is in danger. The
eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding Clark.
Prevailing winds are also away from the base.;    "I'm not so concerned," said
Pauline Lord, Harlow's wife. "My husband is not unaccustomed to danger.";   
Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an
undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and his professor took the entire
class to observe an eruption in Guatemala.;    "He's somebody who's fascinated
by that kind of energy," said Lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied
Harlow to several volcanoes. "It's wonderful to see that lava sloshing
around.";    Harlow's 5-year-old daughter, Megan, is not worried about her
father.;    "She knows Daddy is in the Philippines and that he's fixing a
volcano," Lord said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Harry Glicken, 33, a researcher at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, was believed to have been near the town of Kamikoba to study the
volcano. French vulcanologists Maurice and Katia Kraft also were among the
missing.;    Officials said the three had been making daily appearances at a
site near the mountain that erupted on a far smaller scale on Nov. 17 for the
first time in 198 years, then again on Feb. 12 and May 24.;    Victims with
severe burns and clothes in shreds were taken to nearby hospitals after the
volcano began sending torrents of molten ash, gas and rock down a valley
Monday.;    The liquid fire set dozens of homes ablaze in the mountainside
town of Kamikoba, scorching everything in its path. Authorities evacuated
about 5,000 people.;    Officials said 20 people were injured, 15 of them
seriously burned.;    "There were popping sounds, and there was tremendous
smoke. I expected death at any moment," said Chiyoe Matsuo, who gathered up
valuables from her home and fled.;    Much of what 4,485-foot Mount Unzen was
spewing is known as pyroclastic flow, or glowing avalanche.;    Much faster
than any lava stream, a glowing avalanche can move dozens of miles per hour
and consists of a superheated, fluid-like emulsion of volcanic ash, gas and
rock fragments too heavy to rise skyward.;    White clouds of steam boiled up
hundreds of yards from the mountain, site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster
200 years ago, when 15,000 people died. The area was jolted by earthquakes
early today, the Meteorological Agency reported.;    Miles away, thick
volcanic ash spattered windshields and covered buildings.;    "We are about
eight kilometers (4.3 miles) away from the volcano. I don't know how far the
lava is going to run, but I don't think it will reach the city," said a
Shimabara city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.;    Glicken, who
worked for the U.S. Geological Survey until 1989, had moved to Japan to do
research.;    He had been part of the team of scientists studying Mount St.
Helens in Washington state during the months of volcanic activity before the
big eruption on May 18, 1980, said Mike Fuller, chairman of the Geological
Sciences department at UCSB.;    Glicken left an observatory on Mount St.
Helens the day before the volcano blew, said Joan Magruder, a UCSB
spokeswoman. A total of 57 people were killed, including U.S. Geological
Survey scientist David Johnston, who took Glicken's place.;    "If I heard a
volcano was going to erupt, I would head the other direction," Fuller said.
"But vulcanologists head right for it. It's not always a healthy thing.";   
After graduating from Stanford University, Glicken began his graduate work at
UCSB in 1980, Fuller said. Glicken eventually completed his Ph.D. on the topic
of Mount St. Helens in 1986, Fuller said.;    "He was a very serious student
who did good work," Fuller said.;    Prior to Monday's eruption, Glicken, who
is originally from Los Angeles, had been working and living in Tokyo as part
of his research for the university, Fuller said.;    Glicken's father, Milton
Glicken of Los Angeles, said Monday he had not heard from his son for several
weeks.;    The missing also included some police and firefighters who had been
keeping watch and photographing Mount Unzen, which is less than 30 miles from
Nagasaki.;    The search for survivors and bodies began today after the
government mobilized 600 troops and 160 trucks, jeeps and other vehicles from
nearby army bases, said Mamoru Fujisaki, an army spokesman.;    Army armored
transport vehicles moved into the mountainside area, but soldiers were forced
to retreat after an eruption. They recovered four bodies and said 24 others
had been sighted -- 12 from helicopters and 12 from the ground.;    Local
authorities would only immediately confirm the death of a firefighter who died
after being covered with hot ash. News reports said a police officer had also
died Monday, his patrol car inundated as he drove through Kamikoba warning
residents to leave.;    In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu ordered his
Cabinet to set up a special task force to help with the cleanup.;    "There is
no guarantee that another flow of this scale will not occur again," Daisuke
Shimozuru, chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the Prediction of
Volcanic Eruptions, said at a news conference Monday. "But it is nearly
impossible to say when or where.";    The volcano, one of many that form the
Japanese archipelago, had drawn dozens of researchers and onlookers in recent
weeks as it belched smoke and and oozed lava.;    The last deaths from a
volcanic eruption in Japan were in 1962, when Mount Tokachi on the
northernmost island of Hokkaido erupted, killing five people.;    The
Shimabara area is well known for its many hot springs, which draw large
numbers of tourists each year. But the local tourist trade was reduced to a
trickle after the November eruption.;    About 250 volcanoes form the bulk of
the Japanese archipelago -- 8 percent of all the volcanoes in the world. About
75 of them are active; 19 are designated dangerous and remain under constant
surveillance.;    Landslides and tidal waves created by Mount Unzen's 1792
eruption killed 15,000 people, the worst volcanic disaster in Japanese history.  </TEXT>

   Marilyn Quayle didn't follow the
instructions left in a memo by the White House staff to bring her
sturdiest jogging shoes to Friday's outing on a volcanic island
south of Tokyo.
   She opted instead for more fasionable blue leather flats, but
that didn't stop her from leading the charge up a steep pile of lava
rock.
   With a trail of Japanese scientists, U.S. Secret Service agents,
White House staff members and reporters running to catch up, Mrs.
Quayle hiked up a caldera on Mt. Mihara, the island's active volcano
that last erupted in 1987.
   Nancy Reagan had drugs as her special concern, Barbara Bush has
illiteracy and Marilyn Quayle has disasters.
   Friday's outing was the main event in Mrs. Quayle's natural
disaster activities on a 5-day trip to Japan with Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   While Quayle attended a meeting in Tokyo of the conservative
International Democratic Union, Mrs. Quayle toured this tiny island
of farmers and fishermen to focus attention on what she called a
lifelong interest in natural disaster prevention.
   ``Being born and raised in Indiana, one can't help but be aware
of the havoc nature, especially tornadoes, can wreak and the human
disasters that are caused,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   ``I'm pleased now that I have the opportunity to work to see that
all nations are prepared to meet natural disasters.''
   Guided by seven of Japan's leading experts on volcanos, the vice
president's wife visited the lookout station of the volcano's main
crater, the Oshima Seismic Monitoring Center, and at another crater
she forged ahead where even the experts dared not tread.
   As Mrs. Quayle stepped over a rope and ventured out to get closer
to the edge, Kunio Ando, of the Oshima Weather Station, hung back
and marveled, ``She's very brave.''
   Mrs. Quayle kept going.
   ``She must come back,'' said Taiji Yoshida, director of the Tokyo
Meterological Observatory. ``It's dangerous.''
   She walked on.
   Minutes later, she returned bringing sighs of relief from staff
members.
   In November 1986, 11,000 people were evacuated from Oshima, about
70 miles south of Tokyo, after hundreds of earthquakes rocked the
island and Mt. Mihara erupted, sending a stream of molten lava into
the air.
   Residents of Oshima, located in an area considered one of the
most volcanically active in the world, stayed off the island for a
month.
   There are 77 active volcanoes in Japan. Since 1965, three people
have died in Japanese volcanic eruptions.

<HEAD>Scientists Work On Seismic Equipment at Alaskan Volcano</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions following Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.

   Scores of small quakes have rattled an
Aleut fishing village during the past 17 days, and geologists say
they are keeping a wary eye on the possible source: a volcano
that's been dormant for centuries.
   King Cove village is only nine miles from Mount Dutton's
4,834-foot peak. About 1,000 people live in the village during the
summer; 700 stay through winter.
   Aside from the earthquakes that have been jolting the community
625 miles southwest of Anchorage, there have been no other signs of
an imminent eruption, said Betsy Yount, a U.S. Geological Survey
geologist here.
   ``There's no melting back of snow around the summit. No
steam-type vents,'' sher said Wednesday. ``We're still assessing
the seismic activity to determine whether it's related to volcanic
activity or not.''
   Geologists are unsure when Mount Dutton last erupted.
   ``There's no historical records of its erupting. That means in
the past 200 or so years,'' said John Davies, state seismologist
and coordinating scientist for the newly formed Alaska Volcano
Observatory. ``It may have erupted 500 years ago, but we have no
date. Clearly, it's erupted in the last 10,000 years or so.''
   John Taber, a geologist with Columbia University's Lamont
Doherty Geological Observatory at Palisades, N.Y., said
seismographs first picked up earthquake activity near Mount Dutton
on July 11. Some of the 18 instruments installed by the institute
to monitor Aleutian Arc volcanic activity indicated the first
temblors were centered 10 to 15 miles southeast of the peak, he
said.
   ``In the last three or four days its been dying off,'' Taber
said from the institute's Sand Point office. ``There's no cause for
concern at this point at all. There was a sequence of (earthquakes)
in 1984. They were smaller, but they went on for about four months.
It's not even unusual to have them there.''
   Scores of quakes ranging from 1.0 to 3.6 on the Richter scale
have struck in this round. The peak activity occurred Friday, when
127 were recorded, Taber said. On Monday, there were 25, he said.
   The epicenters moved slowly toward the Mount Dutton, and in the
last few days, the centers have been underneath the volcano's south
flank, Taber said.
   The temblors have jolted the nearby village regularly. ``We've
felt four or five in a day, that's probably the most. But there's
no other sign of activity at all,'' said Cynthia Samuelson, city
clerk the village on the Alaska Peninsula. ``People are concerned,
but no one's leaving.''
   Alaska Division of Emergency Services officials had been
scheduled to travel to King Cove in September, but went this week
because of the earthquakes, said Jim Sey, the agency's chief of
operations and planning.
   ``The main purpose was just to answer questions, make people
aware and bring them up to date on what's happening and explain
different things they could do if there were an eruption,'' Sey
said.
   A telephone line is being installed so that the Geophysical
Institute at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks can monitor Taber's
seismographs, plus one Davies recently installed on the mountain's
flank. Taber has been in Alaska servicing his observatory's
seismographs and plans to leave this week, Davies said.
   The link will allow scientists in Fairbanks to check the
volcano's pulse virtually around the clock, he said.
   ``We're going to monitor it as closely as we can,'' he said.

   Voyager 2 found Neptune's moon Triton to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, Triton is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like Earth's northern and southern
lights _ in several places in Neptune's skies and over much of the
day side of Triton, Roger Yelle, of the University of Arizona, said
today.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, Yelle said. When
the particles are pulled toward Earth's poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to Earth beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of Neptune and Triton
as they were backlighted by the sun. NASA expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than Tuesday.
   Triton apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them Friday: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   Triton's biggest surprise came Sunday, when U.S. Geological
Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said University of Arizona planetary scientist Bradford Smith,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager
project scientist Edward Stone.
   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune in addition to
Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.65 million miles from Neptune, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday
night when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early Friday, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past Triton.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
Triton's volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on Triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' Soderblom said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   Smith said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On Sunday, NASA also revealed more surprises about Triton's
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what Smith described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' Smith said. ``You see that happen in Hawaii all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop Kilauea
volcano.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, Soderblom said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. Smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on Triton's huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Taming the volcanoes - Improved forecasting
techniques are making it easier to predict eruptions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Volcanoes, which spit ash, ooze lava and create darkness in the middle of
the day, are impressive displays of nature's restlessness. They are also
life-threatening: more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the
1980s. They can cause millions of dollars in property damage and bring
industrial activity to a grinding halt.
New technology to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping to
minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause. After the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986, the US government
began taking volcanic forecasting seriously. The US Geological Survey, which
tracks volcanic activity around the world, was infused with new funds to
create a detailed database and update its techniques.
The new technology will not only help to save thousands of lives, it may
also save millions of dollars. According to the Aviation Safety Journal,
more than 60 aircraft have been damaged by drifting clouds of volcanic ash
since 1980. The repair of a 747 aircraft damaged during the 1989 eruption
from Redoubt Volcano in Alaska cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m).
The continuous eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea since 1983 has caused more than
Dollars 5m in damage, much of it to properties and crops affected by the
acid-bearing volcanic pollutants. Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped
out thousands of acres of productive timberland.
Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be
more devastating. Redoubt's eruption, for instance, caused a valuable oil
storage terminal to close for several weeks and halted most flights into and
out of the region.
Tourism often takes the hardest hit of all. When US geologists issued
eruption warnings in California's Long Valley in 1982, the resort area
turned into a ghost town almost overnight. And the tourist-based economy of
Guadeloupe neared collapse in 1976 after an international group of
volcanologists forecast the eruption of La Soufriere.
The Long Valley and Guadeloupe incidents are tinged with bitterness since
the predicted disasters never happened. Guadeloupe evacuated 72,000 people
and tourists stayed away. Yet the only crisis that hit the Caribbean island
was in the economic sphere.
Scientists blame these fiascos on insufficient data. 'The identification of
fresh volcanic glass in the erupted ash - which seemed to indicate that the
volcano was about to erupt violently - was a mistake,' wrote Richard Fiske,
a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution, about the incident.
Volcanologists today use more sophisticated techniques. Detailed databases
are maintained on all life-threatening volcanoes around the world.
High-frequency monitors to measure debris flows are now in place.
Earthquakes - often the first warning of volcanic activity - are tracked
with increasing accuracy. And changes in gas composition, electrical
conductivity and other clues are carefully monitored.
As a result, volcanic activity can now be forecast with substantial
accuracy, often pinpointing the eruption to within days or even hours of its
actual occurrence. When Redoubt erupted in Alaska in 1989 and Pinatubo blew
its top in the Philippines in 1991, volcanologists provided important
information, not only about the timing of the events, but also about the
direction of debris flows and ash blooms - vast clouds formed when tiny
pieces of lava or rock are thrown into the air.
'We used information on the ash blooms (during the Redoubt eruption) to know
which areas to stay away from, and which were safe to fly through,' says
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Air.
Companies can also take advantage of eruption forecasts to move valuable
equipment out of the way, and evacuate employees from the area.
'Businesses with sensitive electronics may want to shut down their air
filtration system during an ash bloom,' says Steven Brantley, public
information scientist with the US Geological Survey. Since ash blooms often
drift for many miles, they can wreak havoc on property well beyond the
life-threatening zone of eruption.
Volcanology can also be used for future planning. After much of its timber
was wiped out during the eruption of Mount St Helens, the paper group
Weyerhaeuser consulted experts to decide which areas should be replanted and
which avoided as too high-risk.
Not all businesses welcome the interference of volcanologists, however. In
Long Valley developers have refused to heed warnings in land use planning.
'We've had mixed results, because we can't force people to follow our
advice,' says Daniel Miller, a geologist with the US Geological Survey.
'We've had a very negative and unpleasant response from businesses in Long
Valley. They just don't believe that they might be in a risk zone and insist
on building things anywhere they please.'
Developers in the region complain that the volcanologists' warnings have
resulted in higher insurance rates, limited areas of potential development
and stoked the fears of tourists.
The relationship between active volcanoes and the communities that surround
them is not always confrontational. Kilauea has become a leading Hawaiian
tourist attraction. It is considered the ideal volcano. Because the eruption
is continuous, it is seldom life-threatening and ash blooms are rare.
Instead, the volcano throws up a scenic display of colourful lava, which
attracts hikers by day and creates a natural light show at night.
Scientists have gleaned much useful information from the decade-long
eruption.
'The resorts look to us to provide information on best viewing times, which
they pass on to the tourists,' says David Clague, scientist in charge of the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory at Kilauea. 'It's generally pretty tame as far as
volcano eruptions go, but it's spectacular at night because it's
iridescent.'

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with school closings in Alaska, airline

<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mount St. Helens trembled after its
biggest outburst in four years, and Alaska's Redoubt Volcano shot
steam and ash in its largest eruption since it reawakened a month
ago, forcing schools to close today.
   Despite Mount St. Helens' eruption and renewed earthquake
activity, scientists said they do not believe the volcano is
entering a more explosive phase.
   Seismic levels rose Monday at the Washington volcano for
unexplained reasons, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University
of Washington Geophysics Center.
   Foul weather kept scientists from flying into the crater by
helicopter to take measurements, gather ash samples and replace
monitoring equipment lost in the volcano's ash burst Saturday.
   Ash collected Sunday was examined under a microscope and found
to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions from the 8,366-foot
peak rather than freshly erupted matter, said Dan Dzurisin, aciting
scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Saturday's burst, which was not preceded by earthquakes, sent
ash 90 miles to the east and destroyed two seismometers and two
tilt meters in the crater.
   Jonientz-Trisler said earthquake signals Saturday indicated the
outburst might have resulted from groundwater reaching superheated
rock beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released
by cooling molten rock.
   The quakes Monday, small but sharp and occurring at an
undetermined depth, resemble some that were recorded last August
but were never explained, she said.
   The latest quake pattern does not resemble any that preceded
previous eruptions, she said. ``We're not especially alarmed,'' she
said.
   The latest eruption was the largest since a series of small
explosions in 1986. On May 18, 1980, a cataclysmic explosion from
the volcano leveled 230 square miles, killed 57 people and sent up
an ash cloud that circled the globe.
   In Alaska on Monday, Redoubt Volcano hurled a plume of steam and
ash almost eight miles into the air before activity subsided in the
afternoon.
   Scientists said the patterns preceding the eruption were very
different from previous blasts from the volcano 115 miles southwest
of Anchorage.
   Most of the ash was carried over the Kenai Peninsula and out
over the Gulf of Alaska. Flights from Anchorage to Kenai and Homer
were canceled immediately. Other flights were canceled as darkness
fell and the ash cloud spread over the gulf.
   The ash plume missed for the most part the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer. But the grit was
sufficiently heavy for officials to close schools today in Kenai,
Soldotna, Nikiski and Sterling.
   Officials said they were concerned about the effect the ash
might have on ventilation systems and didn't want students tracking
ash into the buildings.
   The fishing community of Kasilof south of Kenai was coated with
a quarter-inch of ash. Don Rivers, owner of a Kasilof grocery, said
it was the heaviest ashfall there since the 10,197-foot peak sprang
back to life Dec. 13.
   ``People are pretty much just holing up,'' said Rivers. ``People
are starting to get used to it.''

   Ten years. Time enough for a
forest to spring from lifeless ash. Time enough for people in the
shadow of a restless volcano to recover, even profit, from
catastrophe.
   But never time enough to forget.
   Even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket of
green, the violence of May 18, 1980, remains seared in memory. That
was the day Mount St. Helens exploded, killing 57 people,
flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   Don McElwain remembers. He was camping 20 miles away when hot
ash engulfed him, turning his day to night.
   ``I'm a former Army Ranger and not much scares me,'' he said.
``But I'll tell you, I was doing some praying.''
   McElwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback,
breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode across
ash that singed the hair on the horses' legs.
   But the ordeal did not destroy his love of Mount St. Helens.
Like many of the volcano's neighbors, McElwain, 53, hopes to profit
from a disaster that changed this region's economic life as surely
as it rearranged the landscape. He's been scouting out land,
thinking of starting up a small tourist resort.
   ``Someday,'' he said, ``this place will be beautiful again.''
   Before it erupted, Mount St. Helens was a snowy, symmetrical,
seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests.
Thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness along
crystal-clear Spirit Lake, on the mountain's north side.
   The idyll couldn't last. Mount St. Helens, historically one of
the Cascade Range's most active volcanoes, had not erupted since
1857. Geologists warned it was overdue.
   At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, after weeks of sputtering and
rumbling, the volcano roared awake. An earthquake jarred loose a
huge slab that slid into the lake, weakening the mountain's north
side.
   Magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcano's vents
suddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas, rock and ash
2,500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima.
   A super-heated cloud of pulverized rock, focused horizontally by
the misshapen crater, flattened 150-foot-tall fir trees like pieces
of straw. Across Spirit Lake, a mammoth wave caused by the
landslide sloshed over the opposite ridge, washing the slopes bare
of the downed timber.
   Victims caught in the blast included U.S. Geological Survey
scientist David Johnston, killed even as he monitored delicate
measuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away. Photographer Reid
Blackburn snapped a few pictures, then retreated to his car. He was
found two days later, smothered by ash.
   Harry Truman, who had lived on the mountain 54 years, defied
orders to leave his Spirit Lake lodge, declaring, ``That mountain
is a part of Truman, and I'm a part of it.''
   His words were prophetic. Truman and his lodge were buried under
120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new, deeper Spirit Lake, a
steaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer of
uprooted trees scoured of bark.
   The volcano's heat melted glaciers and starting surging
mudflows. One wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the Toutle River,
destroying trucks, bridges and more than 200 homes.
   An ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward,
darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6
inches deep.
   To observers first returning to the mountain, the destruction
seemed complete. But as weeks went by, scientists watched in
amazement as life appeared amid the ruin.
   Pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels, poking their
heads through ash. Colonies of ants went busily about their
business. Even the most barren areas were soon invaded by
ballooning spiders and beetles, scavengers that floated in on
parachute-like webs and survived on the remains of other insects
blown their way.
   The first summer, green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rose
through 10-inch layers of ash. Later, elk and deer wandered back,
and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted in
fertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash.
   Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a
110,000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural
regeneration, the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall.
Outside the monument, the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies
gave nature a jump start, salvaging downed trees and planting
seedlings in holes bored through ash. Today, some of those trees
stand 25 feet tall.
   As nature heals, so do people. After the eruption, communities
still grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaning
up.
   Fearing more floods, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged rivers,
built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to Spirit Lake. This May
19, officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the Toutle
River, finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than $560
million.
   Muddy rivers have grown clearer, and many residents now look to
St. Helens in hope, not fear. They're staking their futures on the
flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the
contiguous United States.
   More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or
stop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano.
Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entry
restrictions were eased in 1987.
   Roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs, and the
once-flooded town of Toutle sponsors an annual Volcano Daze
Festival. Developers are preparing for 1992, when a highway will be
extended to a new visitor's center peering into the volcano's
crater.
   On sunny spring weekends, the mountain's southern flank becomes
a playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers. There are higher
Northwest mountains for climbing, more accessible mountains for
skiing. But Mount St. Helens, its former 9,677-foot summit reduced
1,300 feet by the eruption, has a magnetic appeal.
   ``I think it's a morbid curiosity,'' said Martha Miller, peering
into the barren crater from the rim after a grueling, six-hour
climb on skis.
   ``It's the mystique,'' said her husband, Ben, who skied the
volcano partly to impress friends back home in New Hampshire, where
the mountains are more sedate. ``St. Helens is an an active
volcano, and everyone's heard of it.''
   Ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time, and the volcano
still sputters. The latest steam release occurred April 25.
   Scientists don't rule out more fireworks but say the possibility
of an eruption is low. A 920-foot lava dome on the crater floor has
not grown since 1986, and geologists, who have honed their
predictive skills since 1980, are confident they can give days or
weeks notice of significant eruptions.
   That's scant reassurance at the volcano rim, where the
mountain's jagged wounds are still raw, its destructive power still
overwhelming. Silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed the
skiers as they stared into the immense crater.
   Ten years later, Mount St. Helens still commands respect.
   ``It makes you feel pretty small,'' Martha Miller said. She
turned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater, and the
skiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest, far
below.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mount St. Helens is approaching a landmark of
sorts: two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash, or
even burps of lava.
   The last ``eruptive episode'' occurred Oct. 21-24, 1986, when
the southwest Washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the
lava dome that sits in its gaping crater.
   The dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater, even though it
has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor.
   The volcano first stirred to life in this century in March 1980,
when it began venting steam and ash from its peak. Its May 18,
1980, eruption leveled 230 square miles of evergreen forest, left
57 people dead or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   It also knocked the top 1,300 feet off the peak, which is now
8,365 feet high.
   Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey cautioned, however,
that the quiet period does not necessarily mean the volcano has
lapsed into long-term inactivity.
   ``Mount St. Helens could erupt again at any time,'' said Don
Swanson, scientist in charge at the USGS observatory in Vancouver,
Wash.
   Throughout its recorded history, Mount St. Helens has had active
periods that lasted for years with relatively short spans of
inactivity. Before the 1980s, the last eruptive period was from
1800 to 1857, with intermittent periods of quiet lasting months or
years, according to the USGS western region office in Menlo Park,
Calif.
   The volcano's most recent eruptions have been quiet,
dome-building affairs, in which the mountain pumps out thick lava
to increase the size of the crater dome. Swanson said, however,
that explosive eruptions such as those in the spring and summer of
1980 remain possible.
   The last eruption added about 3 million cubic yards of material
to the dome, which now contains about 101 million cubic yards of
cooled lava and other volcanic material.
   Seismic activity also has decreased at the mountain, Swanson
said. The volcano and surrounding area are continuously monitored
for earthquake activity by a joint USGS-University of Washington
program.
   Since October 1986, seismic activity has remained at
``background levels,'' scientists said.
   Sulfur dioxide gas continues to escape from cracks in the lava
dome, but has also remained at inconsequential levels of less than
50 tons a day, Swanson said.
   By monitoring seismic activity and other signals, scientists
have correctly predicted 16 of the volcano's 17 dome-building
episodes.

   Hot ash and rocks shot from Mount Etna
and fell on nearby hamlets during a snowstorm, experts said.
   Seismologists at the International Volcanology Institute in
Catania, the Sicilian city lying at the foot of Europe's most
active volcano, also said a series of tremors rattled the top of
Mount Etna over several hours early Friday.
   The southeastern crater of the volcano spit hot ash and lava
rock, which fell on the villages of Maletto, Bronte and Randazzo
during a snowstorm, the seismologists said. No one was injured and
no damage was reported.
   Bad weather conditions did not allow volcanologists to observe
the eruption at close range, but they said it did not appear lava
had flowed down the side of the volcano.

<TEXT>
   Scientists detected new volcanic tremors and a weak
earthquake in the area where an undersea volcano spewed water and
smoke the previous night, and the government warned another eruption
appeared imminent.
   The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction
said an eruption is ``highly likely to recur,'' not only at the same
spot but possibly other locations. It said it was broadcasting
emergency warnings and news on significant developments to local
families.
   Most of the 200 residents in Ito who had left their seaside
houses about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo to spend the night in
Buddhist temples and schools returned home today, but 43 schools
closed amid the uncertainty, said Masaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesman
for the resort city of 72,000 people.
   ``Although there is no immediate danger, we have eight places
ready for evacuees just in case anything worse happens,'' he added.
   No injuries or damage have been reported from Thursday night's
eruption, but 21 people suffered minor injuries Sunday when two
earthquakes measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit the area.
   Since June 30, about 22,300 quakes, including 480 large enough to
be felt by humans, have been recorded off Ito and parts of nearby
Izu Peninsula.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said new volcanic tremors were
measured at 2:47 a.m. today, lasting about 87 minutes, and at 11:42
a.m., lasting about three minutes.
   The volcano erupted about 330 feet undersea at about 6:30 p.m.
Thursday, about 8,000 feet northeast of Teishijima, an uninhabited
islet, the agency said.
   While water rose about 100 feet in the air, no dangerous waves
hit the shore.
   Maritime Safety Agency officials passing nearby on a patrol boat
told Kyodo News Service today they were ``extremely scared'' when
they heard a noise that sounded as though a huge hammer had hit the
bottom of the vessel, and something was pushing the boat from below.
   ``We still have not confirmed whether the eruption formed a new
volcanic mountain under the ocean, but a new piece of ground might
appear out of the ocean,'' said a Central Meteorological official.
   This morning, scores of dead fish and stones of volcanic origin
were found scattered on the Ito shore, Mitsuhashi said.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa and National Land
Agency Director Eiji Nonaka called today for measures to protect
local residents.
   Daisuke Shimozuru, chairman of the earthquake prediction
committee, told a news conference Thursday night that recent quakes
in the area probably have been caused by magma, or molten rock,
under the ocean floor.
   Large magma movements can cause earthquakes, which often precede
volcanic eruptions.
   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, Mount
Tokachi, on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, erupted several
times.

<TEXT>     Roads nearby were clogged with cars, jeeps and buses as thousands of
terrified residents fled. Church bells pealed in the city of Angeles, adjacent
to the air base, warning the more than 300,000 residents to seek shelter.;   
Reporters at the scene said the blast created a greenish-gray mushroom cloud
"like an atomic bomb." They said they heard three blasts, and then a huge
gray-greenish cloud burst from the crater, blocking out the sun.;    There
were no immediate reports of injuries. Philippine officials had evacuated
about 19,000 villagers in recent days, but others stayed in scattered hamlets
to tend to their animals and farms.;    All telephone lines to Clark were
down, and Armed Forces Television was unable to broadcast after at least three
eruptions began at 8:51 a.m. (5:51 p.m. PDT), following two smaller emissions
before dawn. Another eruption occured shortly before noon.;    Scientists said
the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could
come later.;    "Most probably there will be more eruptions," said
seismologist Julio Sabit.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, said everyone within a 12-mile radius
should evacuate, or even within 18 miles, "to be safe.";    'Dark mushroom'; 
"The smoke is very thick, like a dark mushroom in the sky," Gus Abelgas, a
reporter for ABS-CBN television, said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the
volcano's western slopes. "It's just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    Other
reporters described panic as people scampered for safety with their belongings
and livestock.;    Most of the Americans stationed at Clark were transferred
to the Subic Bay Naval Base and were expected to remain there until the danger
from the volcano was past.;    In volcano's path;    Punongbayan said the site
where Clark is located was in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount
Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in the 14th century.;    Rollie
Rimando, another volcanologist, said a major eruption could hurl debris and
poisonous gases in a 12-mile radius, affecting both the base and parts of
Angeles.;    On Tuesday, a cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet
above the volcano but suddenly dissipated in the afternoon, only to revive
again 20 minutes later. The area on the western slope of the mountain was
covered in a thin layer of ash.;    Ash began falling Monday on villages west
of Angeles near the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, prompting authorities to close
roads there. But Angeles police said Tuesday that no one was evacuating the
area.;    Some refused to go;    A Philippine police major identified only as
Major Reyes said he visited a remote settlement near the volcano after the
blast and tried to talk a handful of residents into leaving. But they refused
to abandon their livestock and water buffaloes, known as carabaos.;    "If our
carabaos die, we'll die with them," the officer quoted them as saying.;   
Col. Jose Balajadia, chief of the Philippine military's Clark Air Base
Command, said Tuesday that troops remaining at the base had been issued gas
masks in case ash falls over the installation.;    At the Subic station,
newcomers from Clark tried to sort out their finances, adjust to cramped
living and otherwise cope with dislocation. Finance officers issued partial
pay to personnel who had to leave before having a chance to go to the bank.;  
 Smaller than anticipated;  The eruption appeared to be smaller than that
anticipated by Peter Lipman, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Menlo Park,
who on Monday had said an eruption as massive as that of Mount St. Helens
could occur any day.;    After the eruption, Lipman tried unsuccessfully to
telephone five USGS researchers monitoring the volcano from Clark Air Base.;  
 In a conversation with Lipman half an hour before the eruption, the
researchers said the volcano had had small eruptions earlier in the day. At
the time of the phone call, they were planning a helicopter ride above the
volcano to survey the size of the lava dome inside its crater.;    There are
about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major
eruption was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That
explosion killed about 200 people.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Filipino American
Chamber of Commerce of Santa Clara County is raising funds for evacuating
residents who live near the erupting volcano. Donations of any kind may be
sent to the Filipino American Chamber of Commerce, Santa Clara County, 72 N.

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted with six thundering explosions today, shooting a giant
plume of ash 15 miles high. Molten rock and hot gas poured from the volcano,
and nearby residents fled in panic.;    A Filipino serving with the U.S. Navy

<TEXT>     Residents of nearby Angeles panicked when a huge, gray-greenish mushroom
cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night. Thousands of fleeing
people packed roads.;    "Stones as big as my head were falling down from the
mountains," said Rolly Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said
Manuel Romualdo. "Children were crying. We had to grab whatever we could.";   
Scientists warned of more, possibly larger eruptions from the 4,795-foot
volcano, which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in
April.;    "This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.;   
Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had
not ordered a general evacuation there.;    Hundreds of Americans fled Clark,
home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most of the
base's residents had been evacuated Monday. The base did not appear
immediately threatened by volcanic flow.;    Seismologists said searing gas,
ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountain's western and
northern slopes. They said most of the debris flowed into the Marella,
Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property
or homes had been damaged.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman, descendants of the
original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of Mount Pinatubo.;  
 At a refugee center in Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors
told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed
by a rain of ash.;    They said they scampered for safety with their
belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall, many wearing
cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by
the eruption," television reporter Bert Basa said. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and
windshield wipers on.;    A photographer who circled the volcano in an
airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was covered with ash, as were
mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks.;   
Today's first eruption began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent
forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes
later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume could be
seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it
blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China Sea.;   
Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.;    The
Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said the explosions
occurred at 10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m. The second explosion sent a plume of ash
and steam 80,000 feet into the sky.;    Shortly after midnight, a sixth
explosion was reported.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of
built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The
crisis has not ended yet," said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology. "We have signs that the volcano is preparing for
another one.";    Punongbayan warned people within a 15-mile radius of
Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the
sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas said in a broadcast from Botolan, near
the volcano's western slopes. He said strong tremors preceded the nighttime
eruptions and continued afterward.;    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few
belongings Monday moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval
base, 50 miles to the southwest.;    Clark is one of the biggest U.S. bases
overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was in the path of the
volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.;   
About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near
the volcano's slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers
outside the projected danger zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated
after today's eruption.;    About 10 people in Moraza, a village on the
western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
They told rescuers that they would not leave their livestock and if the
animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2, Pinatubo produced a
small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks
deep inside. On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption.;    That
same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an explosion of
superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    Experts say there
is apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Unzen continued to smolder, shudder and spew lava today, and one expert
said the thousands of people who evacuated homes at its foot will not return

<TEXT>     Three nationally circulated newspapers, the Yomiuri, Mainichi and Nikkei,
published such pictures, some of which were marred by black holes and marks
where the film apparently was damaged by the heat.;    The body of one
photographer, Tadahoshi Tsuchiya, 58, was identified by his wristwatch, its
glass cover blown off and the hands stopped at 4:18 p.m., the time the
4,452-foot volcano erupted.;    "He must have suffered terribly -- it must
have been unbearably hot," his wife, Tsukimi, 56, said after seeing his body,
according to the Yomiuri newspaper.;    Tremors and smoke;    The mountain 600
miles southwest of Tokyo remained relatively quiet today, although it shook
with minor tremors and billowed thick, white smoke and a thin stream of lava
trickled out.;    Since Monday's eruption, about 800 soldiers in silver
flame-retardant gear have been searching for bodies in the volcanic debris
spread across the mountain's eastern face.;    Rescue helicopters today lifted
one more body from its ash-covered slopes. Fear of a new eruption slowed the
effort. Only 27 bodies have been recovered, according to news reports. Six
other people died in hospitals.;    Relatives and friends have helped identify
21 bodies, including those of three foreign volcano experts, said police in
Nagasaki, 30 miles to the west. Officials said many of the victims were burned
beyond recognition.;    Foreigners identified;    The three foreigners were
volcanologist Harry Glicken, 33, of the University of California, Santa
Barbara; and Maurice Krafft, 45, and his wife, Katia, 44, a French couple who
had been tracking the world's most active and dangerous volcanoes for 25
years.;    Krafft, one of France's leading volcanologists, had once said if he
had to die, "I want it to be at the edge of a volcano.";    Volcano experts
warned that a huge amount of magma, or underground molten rock, inside Mount
Unzen could produce another large eruption. Lodged in the crater was a
tongue-shaped lava rock about 230-260 feet wide.  </TEXT>

<P>
Fiery tongues of lava from Kilauea Volcano have ravaged this coastal community. 
But compared to some of its cousins around the world, the Hawaiian volcano is 
downright polite. "At least it gives you time. It lets you take what you want, 
and you can watch it," said Leslie Doctor, who stood mesmerized as the searing 
lava bore down on his family's home. 
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption began seven years ago, Kilauea has torched more than 160 
houses, buried a highway and smothered more than 30 square miles in a blanket 
of solid rock. But the disaster has been played out in slow motion and nobody 
has been caught in the lava's lethal grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that with the explosive blast of Mt. St. Helens, which devastated more 
than 200 square miles of forest in a matter of hours on May 18, 1980, felling 
trees like toothpicks. The eruption spewed 540 million tons of ash over 22,000 
square miles and left 57 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the two volcanoes are breeds apart. A glance at their profiles is 
enough to distinguish them. Kilauea has a gently sloping silhouette; Mt. St. 
Helens had a sharp, conelike peak. 
</P>
<P>
But the differences run deeper, as deep as the molten rock of the Earth's 
mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. St. Helens has its roots in friction, appropriately enough for such a 
mean-tempered mountain. The theory of plate tectonics holds that the Earth's 
crust is divided into huge slabs that float on its hot, fluid mantle. As the 
plates collide or grind past each other they cause a commotion on the Earth's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Helens' case, scientists believe the Pacific Plate is forcing its way 
under the North American plate, generating the heat for the mountain's 
outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii is a different story. The island chain lies smack in the middle of the 
Pacific Plate, 2,000 miles from its nearest boundary. There are no collisions 
here. The oceanic plate is skating toward Asia at a leisurely pace of only four 
inches a year, hardly enough to rattle an island riding on it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, scientists believe that an extremely hot area deep in the Earth's 
molten mantle, called a fixed "hot spot," is fueling Hawaii's creation. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are engaged in a continuing debate over the nature of Hawaii's hot 
spot. Despite the fact that Hawaii's volcanoes are the most extensively studied 
in the world, no one is sure why there should be such a thing as a hot spot, or 
why it should remain fixed in one location as the Pacific Plate slides over it. 
There are other hot spots around the globe, but the Hawaii spot, which created 
the islands as well as a chain of undersea hills called "seamounts" that extend 
across the western Pacific, is the most dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spot melts the Pacific Plate that is slowly drifting above it, and 
piles up one volcanic island after another. As the volcanoes age, they float 
away from the furnace, gradually extinguishing their flames. 
</P>
<P>
The process is literally older than the hills. The hot spot, estimated to be 25 
to 40 miles below the Earth's surface, has been gurgling up molten rock 
steadily since the time of the dinosaurs. Kilauea, on the island of Hawaii, 
simply is the most recent to breach the waves. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spot also is feeding Mauna Loa, Kilauea's active neighbor, as well as a 
new island forming off shore. Kilauea's youngest sibling, Loihi, won't emerge 
from the ocean for at least 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"People call this destruction, but it's the way the Earth was developed," said 
Harry Kim, a civil defense administrator grappling with the effects of today's 
flow. "Mankind has simply put himself in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Such geological forces may hold clues to the nature of the volcanic dramas on 
the Earth's surface. Because the ingredients of the continental and oceanic 
plates differ, the molten rock they produce also varies. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the chief factor determining the force of eruptions is the 
content of the magma stored in volcanic chambers. The more viscous, or sticky, 
the magma, the more explosive the eruption. 
</P>
<P>
"If the lava is fluid, gas can escape more easily, like bubbles from a soda," 
said Ken Hon, staff geologist at Hawaii Volcano Observatory, which is perched 
on the lip of Kilauea's summit crater. "Kilauea's lava is fluid, like syrup. At 
Mt. St. Helens, the lava is stiffer, more like taffy. The gas bubbles expand 
but they can't rise through it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, pressure builds until finally the magma explodes with great 
force into tiny bits. Such blasts are called pyroclastic, literally "broken 
fire." It takes much longer for such "stratovolcanos" to build up the energy 
for an eruption. Mt. St. Helens usually rests for hundreds of years between 
blasts. Kilauea's clock runs in tens of years. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian lava, known as basalt, contains less silicon and aluminum and more 
iron, magnesium and calcium than what erupted at Mt. St. Helens. It flows more 
freely, both below and above ground, gradually shaping the volcano's gentle 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
Eruptions in Hawaii typically begin with "curtains of fire," vertical sheets of 
lava that spurt along cracks in the Earth. The fountains often settle on one 
vent and spout like enormous hoses. In the 1950s, Kilauea was called "the 
drive-in volcano" because it was so obliging to people who wanted to watch its 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fountains can be spectacular (one shot nearly 2,000 feet in the 
air), the force behind them is relatively weak. By comparison, the 1980 St. 
Helens eruption sent ash more than 12 miles into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
When the fountains in a Hawaiian eruption subside, either they die or the magma 
migrates down-slope to a site of less pressure, where it oozes continuously 
from the opening. Today's flow is welling up out of the East Rift Zone, a 
weakened swath on Kilauea's flank. 
</P>
<P>
"Kilauea's lava fountains and flows can be seen, usually in plenty of time to 
get out of the way," said Steve Brantley, public information scientist for the 
Cascades Volcano Observatory. "With explosive volcanoes like Mt. St. Helens, 
the sequence of events can begin very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Although there were warning signs, including a bulge on the face of the 
mountain, no one anticipated the speed or force of the 1980 St. Helens blast. 
The eruption, according to Cascades Volcano Observatory scientists, was 
preceded by a landslide that dug a gash in the face of the volcano, allowing 
the highly pressurized magma to burst through, like a pressure cooker whose lid 
was knocked off too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never have that circumstance in Hawaii if you had a landslide that 
exposed part of the plumbing system," said Tom Wright, scientist in charge of 
the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. "You'd get some release, but it wouldn't be 
anywhere near the force of St. Helens."

Explosive eruptions, however, are not impossible even at Hawaii's seemingly 
gentle volcanoes. Occasionally, as magma drains out of a vent, ground water 
interacts with the hot rock and flashes into steam, causing explosions.

In 1790, such an eruption blanketed Kilauea's summit with as much as 30 feet of 
pyroclastic debris. About 80 Hawaiian warriors trekking across the volcano's 
flank suffocated in the hot gas. Their footsteps, still discernible in the ash 
deposits, serve as a warning that, even in easygoing Hawaii, no volcano is 
entirely predictable.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A volcano in southern Chile erupted for
the first time in a century Sunday, prompting authorities to
evacuate about 2,000 people.
   Flor Verdugo, a school teacher in Malalcahuello who owns the only
telephone in the town, said the Lonquimay volcano began to erupt
about 4:15 p.m. (2:15 p.m. EST) after the area was rocked by three
strong earthquakes, according to state television in Santiago.
   There were no reports of injuries from the eruption or the
quakes. Temblors can often precede volcanic activity.
   The government's National Emergency Office said the evacuation of
virtually the entire population of Malalcahuello was only a
precaution and that the town, about 415 miles south of Santiago, was
not considered in danger.
   The government said three craters opened on the 8,400-foot
volcano, two of them emitting only heavy smoke. However, the largest
crater, with a radius of about 100 feet, spewed a thick carpet of
lava.
   Ms. Verdugo said a number of quakes have been felt in the area
for several days. The seismic activity, which has affected an area
of about 30 square miles, became more intense Sunday morning, she
said. There were no immediate Richter scale readings.
   Pedro Riffo, a specialist of La Frontera University in Temuco,
the largest city in the area, told local reporters the eruption did
not threaten any populated area. He said Malalcahuello, the closest
town, is surrounded by a chain of mountains that would serve as a
natural defense.
   Riffo said three other volcanoes exist in the area, but only one
of them, the Llaima, has shown some activity in recent years.
   The last registered eruption of the Lonquimay volcano occurred in
1889, Riffo said.

<LEADPARA>  About 15,000 U.S. service members, dependents and civilians were ordered early
today to evacuate Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. bases overseas,
after a Philippine volcano dormant for six centuries began exploding with
searing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a spokesman
at Clark, announced at 5 a.m. that all non-essential personnel should begin
evacuating the sprawling base as dawn skies over central Luzon were filled
with gray ash and steam from eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, about 10 miles away
in central Luzon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rand said that Americans who live on or near the base would drive or be
bused to the U.S-operated Subic Bay Naval Base, about an hour's drive to the
southwest. The evacuation was to take four hours, he said.;    There was no
indication how long the Americans would stay, but they were ordered to take
along important papers and three days worth of food, water and clothing.;   
Philippines officials earlier had ordered the evacuation of more than 11,000
people from about 20 villages near the volcano, about 60 miles northwest of
Manila, after a series of small eruptions began Friday. No injuries were
reported over the weekend.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said, however, that two
moderate eruptions shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday appeared to signal a larger
explosion.;    "We're expecting a major eruption," he said in a telephone
interview early today. "We're just at the beginning stage of eruptions. We're
expecting many, many more.";    Punongbayan said that the 4,795-foot-high
volcano was spewing gases up to 1,800 degrees, thick black ash, boulders and
rock fragments in two fast-moving streams from two vents on the western side
of the lower summit.;    "It's very dangerous," he said. "Anything along its
path will be destroyed.";    Clouds and ashes;  Sunday's eruptions sent a
dense cloud of steam and ash billowing thousands of feet above rice paddies
that are lush green from an impending harvest. Heavy black clouds shrouded the
mountain, and a blanket of gray ash covered nearby fields. Debris reportedly
was sprayed as far as the South China Sea, 20 miles to the west.;    Villagers
from a 12-mile radius of the mountain fled the area on foot and water buffalo,
and aboard crowded trucks and jitneys. The Philippines Red Cross said 11,024
people, including local Aeta aborigines, were evacuated to 18 disaster relief
centers set up at area schools, but officials said that many villagers stayed
behind to protect their animals and farms from looters.;    Rand said the
evacuation of Clark was ordered "due to a slight increase of volcanic
activity" overnight. All U.S. Air Force planes had moved from the base to Cubi
Point Naval Air Station near Subic on Sunday, and infants in the base's
neo-natal hospital and other patients had been flown out.;    Evacuation
rehearsal;  All military personnel at Clark, home of the 13th Air Force, were
recalled to the base Sunday afternoon, and U.S. officials ordered local
Americans to pack bags and rehearse evacuation procedures.;    "People are
pretty calm," said one American woman who lives on the base. "People are
prepared.";    Rand said that a minimal number of troops would remain at Clark
to guard the facility and maintain essential services. Marines from Subic as
well as Philippines and U.S. military police were deployed along the road to
provide security.;    The volcano began showing signs of activity in April for
the first time in 600 years, and last week it began belching small amounts of
steam and smoke. Seismologists reported a marked increase in volcanic tremors
last week, with intense seismic quakes on the mountain Friday.;     Last
eruption;  Mount Pinatubo last erupted in 1380, 141 years before Ferdinand
Magellan, a Portuguese explorer flying the flag of Spain, first reached the
islands in search of spices.;    There are about 21 active and 200 dormant
volcanoes in the Philippines, which sits on the "Ring of Fire" that circles
the Pacific Ocean. Scientists said there was no connection, however, to the
eruption last Monday of Japan's Mount Unzen, which killed at least 37 people
on Kyushu Island. A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris erupted there Saturday,
setting 73 homes on fire.;    Nearly 10,000 people have left their homes at
the foot of Mount Unzen, and two naval ships stood by to take residents
farther away in case a new eruption sent lava, hot rocks and ash over a yet
wider area.  </TEXT>

   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly Kansas.
   For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probe
Magellan will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellan
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
Earth.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said Steve Saunders,
Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to Venus.
   Pictures from Magellan should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist Laurence Soderblom, a scientist
working on the Magellan project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, Magellan should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' NASA says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. Magellan will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier U.S.
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest.
   Magellan, once it begins orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a $550-million project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said Soderblom, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey
in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between Venus and Earth, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon,
Mercury and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
Saunders, himself a geologist.
   The moon, Mercury and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe Venus and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on Earth.
   Rock in Earth's crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath Alaska, Washington
and Oregon.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and Gerald Schaber, another USGS
geologist, believe Venus loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On Earth, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in Hawaii. But there's evidence
that Venus has crustal movement similar to Earth and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of Earth's midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against Venus' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than Everest.
   These regions look something like Earth's Himalayas, mountains
formed when India smashed into China. So crustal movements on Venus
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, Schaber said.
   If large plates of Venus' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic.;    The decision to evacuate one

gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds
of up to 60 mph.  </LEADPARA>

AMERICANS FLEE BASE IN PHILIPPINES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week
after six centuries of dormancy. No casualties have been reported, but experts
are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon.;    Gases, ash and
molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in
thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.;    The Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground
movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of
the craters.;    Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo
was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."; 
  He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from
Clark. But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600
years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark.;
   Rains fell across the area Sunday night, and officials warned residents in
the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to
escape mud flows.;    Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand announced the
evacuation in a 5 a.m. broadcast over the U.S. military's Far East Network. An
hour later, the first vehicles began rolling out of Clark for the U.S.-run
Subic Bay naval base, where the 14,500 troops, dependents and civilian
employees will be housed until the danger passes. Another 1,500 troops
remained at Clark to provide security.;    The Clark command center operated
with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended. The base is a
major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military
Airlift Command.;    The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading
to Subic, about 50 miles southwest of Clark. U.S. Marines patrolled the
highways, which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate, and
U.S. helicopters hovered overhead.;    By late afternoon, U.S. officials said
all the evacuees had reached Subic.;    "If it's going to blow, I hope it does
it fast so I can go home before the cockroaches take my house," said Staff
Sgt. Mike Huffman.;    Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than
300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila. In Angeles, residents reported
no ash fell today but said the air smelled of sulfur.;    In southern Japan
today, Mount Unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy
rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week,
raising fears of deadly mudslides.;    Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano
covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against
possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police
said.;    An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain
one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens
more homes. In all, about 9,800 people have been evacuated from communities at
the foot of the mountain, said police in Nagasaki, 30 miles away.;    Mount
Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific
where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other, triggering
periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.;    In the Philippines, officials
have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces since Mount Pinatubo
began erupting last week. About 3,100 of them are primitive Aeta tribes people
who lived on Pinatubo's slopes.;    Many of them walked or traveled by ox cart
to flee the volcano. But reporters found that some evacuees are returning to
their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to
evacuation centers at sundown.;    Punongbayan said he flew to the area and
warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins.; 
  There was no indication how long the Americans evacuated from Clark would
stay at Subic, but they were ordered to take along important papers and food,
water and clothing for three days.;    Subic base spokesman Bob Coble said
families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that
others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters.;    Mount
Pinatubo, which last had a major eruption in 1380, began to show signs of
activity in April. Last week, it belched small amounts of steam and ash.;   
There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The
last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles
south of Manila, exploded. About 200 people were killed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  As Japan's deadliest volcano eruption in 65 years snuffed out more lives and
destroyed entire villages, experts warned that the worst may be yet to come.; 
  Super-heated rock, pumice and volcanic ash belched from Mount Unzen, near
the atomic-bombed city of Nagasaki, for the third day today, raising the death
toll to 33. Houses on the flanks of the 4,485-foot mountain were burned to the
ground, and farmland was coated in a thick layer of volcanic dust as the fiery
mixture raced down the slopes at speeds up to 60 mph.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  JAPANESE VOLCANO'S WORST IS YET TO COME,
EXPERTS FEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     According to Akira Kubodera, one of Japan's leading volcanologists, Mount
Unzen was likely to continue spewing death and destruction for another two to
six months. The lava flowing from the current eruption amounts to only about
10 percent of what blew out of the mountain the last time it erupted, in
1792.;    Kubodera's greatest fear, in fact, is a sudden halt in volcanic
activity.;    "The worst-case scenario is that the mountain becomes quiet all
of a sudden," Kubodera said. "That is a calm before the storm, which means an
enormous amount of magma is being accumulated inside the mountain so one
eruption will spew a tremendous amount of lava into the air, perhaps much
larger than what was seen on Monday, and cause horrible damage to the area."; 
  Other experts also have concluded that it's unlikely this episode is over.; 
  Tamagawa University volcano expert Takeyo Kosaka said lava fragments belched
out of the mountain were as hot as 300 degrees Fahrenheit. The intense heat
from a second eruption on Tuesday forced rescue operations to stop after 90
minutes.;    Because of the high temperatures, the bodies of only five of the
volcano's initial victims were retrieved. The heat generated by the continuing
eruptions was so severe that even soldiers wearing flame-resistant clothing
and traveling in armored tanks were unable to reach the other 28. Identifying
the dead has not yet been possible because they have been burned beyond
recognition, authorities said.;    An additional 17 people were hospitalized
with injuries, eight of them listed in critical condition. Officials at
hospitals in nearby Shimabara said victims were being brought in with burns
over most of their bodies, their clothing in shreds, crying for water.;   
Plans by the Ground Self-Defense Forces -- Japan's military -- to lift 1,000
rescue workers into the disaster area by helicopter also were abandoned when
organizers realized the whirling rotors stirred the thick ash covering the
ground, hindering all work.;    Television footage, mainly shot from
helicopters, showed an eerie, lifeless world of gray. Although the video was
in color, none appeared on the screen. Occasionally, an immobile arm or leg
could be seen protruding from the thick dust layer. Cars and vans had been
tossed off the roads like toys and were lying at crazy angles, broken and
burning.;    Takeshi Sato, a reporter for the Mainichi newspaper, which has
three staff members among the missing, described an unnerving motorcycle ride
he took in a desperate, fruitless attempt to locate his colleagues:;    "The
ashes lay about five centimeters (two inches) deep on top of the ground, and I
could feel the warmth through the soles of my shoes. The rain fell black.
Power poles, trees from five to seven meters (roughly the same distance in
yards) in diameter -- almost all standing things looked as if they had been
wrenched down by some giant force.";    So far, the Mount Unzen eruption is
the deadliest to have struck Japan since Hokkaido's Mount Tokachi blew up in
1926, killing 144 people and burying two villages beneath a sea of mud, rock
and lava.;    The worst volcanic eruption in Japan's history came from Mount
Unzen itself, 199 years ago. Records from the period say that as many as
15,000 people were killed, most of them drowned in a tidal wave generated by
the blast. That eruption also triggered an earthquake, which sent an entire
mountain range tumbling into nearby Ariake Bay.;    Authorities on the scene
at the current disaster said they presumed that among the 33 dead was Harry
Glicken, 33, a volcanologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Glicken, who was working with the Tokyo Metropolitan University, reportedly
escaped death in 1980 when he fled the Mount St. Helens eruption at the last
moment.  </TEXT>

thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud
burst from the volcano and turned day to night.;    At a refugee center in
Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing

"Stones as big as my head were falling down from the mountains," said Rolly
Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said Manuel Romualdo, who fled
with his wife, five children, a cat and a dog. "Children were crying. We had
to grab whatever we could.";    Scientists warned of more, possibly larger
eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries
until it began spewing steam in April.;    "This could only be the beginning,"
said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology.;    Tens miles to the east, hundreds of Americans fled Clark
Air Base, home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most
of the base's residents had been evacuated Monday.;    Clark did not appear
threatened by volcanic flow, and there were no immediate reports of
casualties.;    Seismologists said searing gas, ash and molten rock raced at
great speed down the mountain's western and northern slopes and into the
Marella, Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman,
descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of
Mount Pinatubo.;    People scampered for safety with their belongings and
livestock over roads slippery with ash fall. Refugees wore cardboard boxes to
protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by the eruption,"
reporter Bert Basa said by telephone from Angeles. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and
wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. Bits of ash
wafted across the roads as if along a windy beach.;    A photographer who
circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was
covered with ash, as were mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush,
green tropical peaks that now looked like the Alps in winter.;    Today's
eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent forth a
mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and
a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume 12 1/2 miles high
could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene
said it blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China
Sea.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even
more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The crisis has not ended," said
Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. "We
have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one.";    Punongbayan
warned people within a 12-mile radius of Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is
very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas
said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. "It's
just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    Moments after the first explosion, sirens
wailed at Clark Air Base, and 600 of the 1,500 Americans remaining there fled
eastward to safety. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said 900 Americans,
mostly security personnel, remained at the 130,000-acre base.;    Clark is one
of the biggest U.S. bases overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was
in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major
eruption, in 1380.;    The Pentagon, which is trying to negotiate a new
contract with Manila for the base, said it can work around the temporary loss
of Clark.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few belongings on Monday
moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles to
the southwest.;    Although the Air Force left Clark, Philippine authorities
have not ordered a general evacuation of Angeles, a city of more than 300,000
people adjacent to the base.;    When Mount Pinatubo erupted today, church
bells pealed to sound the alarm and many people froze in their tracks with
fear. Many scampered for safety indoors.;    About 19,000 Filipinos had
earlier been evacuated from three provinces near the volcano's slopes and were
housed in about 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger
zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated after today's eruption but they
could provide no new figures.;    In the Sapang Bato area of Angeles, the city
district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been
evacuated as of Monday, officials said.;    Reporters visiting the village
today found it abandoned except for a few chickens and cattle. Houses were
padlocked, but the explosion had shattered some windows.;    Private jeep and
bus companies were ordered to the area today to pick up stragglers. About 10
people in Moraza, a village on the western slope, were refusing to leave,
relief officials said. They told rescuers that they would not leave their
livestock and if the animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2,
Pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water
meeting hot rocks deep inside.;    On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild
eruption. That same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an
explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    A
larger flow days later razed dozens of houses.;    Experts say there is
apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>

   Voyager 2's close-up photos of Neptune's
moon Triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt
explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles
high, scientists said Sunday.
   ``I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within the
past 100 years, said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Larry
Soderblom, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.''
   ``This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at the
current time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added.
   While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active,
``the whole process makes physical sense,'' said Bradford Smith,
leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. ``That is a perfectly sensible
explanation.''
   If Soderblom and Smith are right, Triton is only the third object
in the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth and
Jupiter's moon Io are the others.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes with
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on Triton
are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises
to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got to explode
and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster,
sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said Smith, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. The
deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to the
surface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added.
   Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday night
when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloud
tops. Early Friday morning, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 miles
past Triton, taking the photos that have revealed at least three
kinds of icy volcanism on the moon.
   Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the
floors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming out
of a tube slit with a razor blade.
   On Friday, scientists announced that Voyager had discovered a
different type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive and
possibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas,
similar to the one in which Yellowstone National Park rests.
   Some calderas, such as the crater atop Hawaii's Kilauea volcano,
fill with lava lakes. Triton's calderas, measuring up to hundreds of
miles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that
gushes up from below, Smith said.
   New evidence released Sunday shows Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can
come up and overflow. You see that happen in Hawaii all the time''
when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, Smith said.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced ``a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in ``massive,
oceanic-scale flooding,'' Soderblom said during a Sunday news
conference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted on
Triton.
   Soderblom said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past
century because they are located on Triton's huge south polar ice
cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune, in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It
also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including
two that are broad bands of dust.
   The latest ring photo released by NASA Sunday shows one of those
bands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circular
sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of Neptune's rings
and extends inward toward the planet.
   NASA's latest results from Voyager's close encounters with
Neptune and Triton found that:
   _Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in Neptune's
atmosphere.
   _A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take
four minutes.
   _Neptune's south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are
much hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.
   _The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees
away from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a much
greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially
estimated. That means Neptune's magnetic north pole is closer to its
equator than to its rotational north pole.
   It also means Neptune is much more similar to Uranus, which has a
magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted
12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.19 million miles behind Neptune, speeding away from the
planet at 37,621 mph.
   The probe on Sunday was looking for lightning and auroras on
Triton. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon
1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as Neptune's second-largest moon.

<HEAD>Volcanic Activity On The Rise In Central America</HEAD>

   A volcano erupted near here, and another
crater spewed ash and steam in Nicaragua, but officials in the two
Central American countries said Thursday they had no immediate
reports of major damage or injuries.
   Eddy Sanchez, deputy director of Guatemala's Seismological
Institute, said in an interview that 255 residents of two villages
on the slopes of the Pacaya Volcano were forced to evacuate their
homes because of lava flows.
   Pacaya, 16 miles south of the capital, started spewing lava
Tuesday afternoon. About 175 people in the village of El Caracol and
80 from El Patrocinio cleared out of their homes late Wednesday,
hours ahead of a small river of lava that destroyed their
coffee-bean fields.
   But a number of farmers in other villages in the area stayed
behind, Sanchez said. He said the lava is flowing down Pacaya's
slopes in a southeasterly direction at about 15 feet an hour.
   The 8,421-foot peak, one of 32 volcanos dotting Guatemala, has
been erupting intermittently since it first turned active Jan 21,
1987. On Tuesday, the volcano blew open a new crater.
   ``The Pacaya continues active, spewing out lava with constant
explosions,'' Sanchez said.
   In Nicaragua, Santiago volcano, 12 miles southeast of the
capital, Managua, began releasing white gases on Sunday, but
scientists monitoring the activity say there is no immediate danger
of an eruption.
   Santiago is one of three in the Masaya complex, one of the most
active volcanic ranges in Central America. Its single crater has
been releasing gases about once every two decades.
   Lava flows often have followed the initial eruptions, but they
solidified before reaching populated areas.
   Favio Segura, an engineer with the Nicaraguan Institute of
Territorial Studies, told reporters, ``It is difficult to predict if
Santiago will develop a large or small lava flow.''
   He said three Nicaraguan and three British vulcanologists are
monitoring the peak around the clock.
   The National Association of Geologists has reported no
``immediate risk of a violent explosion that would endanger
surrounding communities.''

<HEAD>Say Dives Exciting, But No Hot Springs Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists' first dives to the bottom
of Crater Lake turned up no signs of expected hot springs that
might be evidence of ancient volcanic activity, but their submarine
ride gave them a new outlook.
   ``I think so far we have seen similar things, but in much
greater detail than last year,'' when a robot submarine explored
the lake, Oregon State University oceanographer Jack Dymond said
Sunday, describing the first two dives.
   ``We haven't found any actual thermal springs,'' said Dymond,
who made the first manned dive to the bottom of the nation's
deepest lake Friday. The deepest point in the lake is 1,932 feet.
   Dymond and fellow OSU oceanographer Robert Collier are using a
one-man submersible called Deep Rover to search the lake for hot
springs that may be the remnants of volcanic activity that formed
the lake.
   Dymond said he saw what he interpreted as evidence of old hot
springs: deposits of iron and manganese and rock formations with
colored stains on holes or cracks.
   The research could affect efforts by California Energy Co. to
develop hydrothermal energy nearby, outside the boundary of Crater
Lake National Park. If the lake is found to have significant
geothermal features, development in the neighboring Winema National
Forest could be prohibited.
   The two men are in the second year of a three-year effort
financed by the National Park Service to learn why the lake's water
is so clear, with visibility measured to depths of 85 to 115 feet.
   Collier, who made his first dive Saturday, said that at a depth
of 1,200 feet blue light was still visible from above.
   Their work is part of a larger 10-year study started after
scientists in the 1970s noticed a significant reduction in the
lake's clarity. Recent measurements have shown the clarity
returning to levels last measured in the 1930s.
   Dymond and Collier said nothing they have found so far could
settle the question of whether drilling for hydrothermal energy
more than seven miles away would affect the lake.
   California Energy Co. geologist Joe LaFleur said if hot springs
do exist, they wouldn't be affected by the drilling.
   Crater Lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled a
crater, called a caldera, formed when the Mount Mazama volcano
erupted nearly 7,000 years ago and then collapsed into what had
been a chamber filled with molten rock.
   Collier and Dymond said sonar echos off unexpectedly craggy
features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation
difficult.
   Precise navigation is important. Last year, while using the
remote-controlled submersible, scientists found what looked like a
vent oozing a milky fluid. However, they were never able to
relocate it to take a temperature reading or a fluid sample.

<HEAD>Northern Japanese Town Alert to Possible Volcanic Eruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People living near a volcano in northern Japan that
came to life last month for the first time in 26 years are bracing
themselves for another powerful eruption.
   Scientists studying the volcano said Wednesday there were signs
another major eruption was developing.
   ``Based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major,
powerful eruption to match'' those that occurred in 1926 and 1962,
said Yoshio Fujii, professor on volcanology and petrology at
Hokkaido University.
   Fujii based his prediction on analysis of rock samples taken from
nearby peaks following the Dec. 19 eruption of the 6,814-foot Mount
Tokachi in central Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.
   Koichi Ueda, an official of Kamifurano-cho, a town of 14,000
people just 15 miles from Mount Tokachi, said 13 town officials were
maintaining an around-the-clock watch.
   No damage or injuries were reported in the Dec. 19 eruption.
   Heat from Mount Tokachi's eruption in 1926 melted almost all the
snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people and
injured another 200 in two nearby villages. A smaller eruption in
1962 killed four people.
   Activity inside Mount Tokachi has intensified since Jan. 9
because magma is rising from deep within the Earth to about 1,650
feet below the crater of the volcano, according to Hiroshi Okada,
head of Hokkaido University's Usu volcano Observatory.
   ``The form of volcanic activity has started changing,''
indicating the possibility of an explosion of magma from the
mountain, Kyodo News Service quoted Okada as saying.

   The Magellan spacecraft has found
evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock once inundated more
than half the surface of Venus.
   NASA scientists said they don't yet know if there was one great
outpouring of lava from cracks in Venus or a series of smaller
flows, each hundreds of thousands of square miles, that engulfed
parts of Venus at different times.
   The scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
reported the findings Wednesday.
   Magellan uses radar to make pictures of cloud-covered Venus. The
spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989,
went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally began making
maps and pictures of the planet on Sept. 15.
   Geologist Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist, said he
favors the view that the lava gushed out of cracks called vents in
a global set of eruptions that happened all at once, maybe 400
million years ago.
   Brown University geologist and Magellan scientist Jim Head said,
however, the evidence is incomplete.
   ``There's no question that the vast majority of the surface of
Venus has been formed by lava flows and volcanic activity,'' he
said. ``But the question is, did it all happen catastrophically?''
   The lava covers roughly 60 percent of the planet, according to
Saunders.
   Saunders said he began to suspect Venus was subject to such
catastrophic volcanic activity because Magellan's pictures of Venus
show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than
Earth's moon, and because ``the ones we find are all relatively
fresh.''
   That suggests ``there's a process of very widespread volcanism
that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters - and
everything else,'' he said.
   Saunders said Venus' widespread lava flooding was similar to,
but much larger than, vast lava deposits such as India's Deccan
Traps and the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River basalts.
   The Deccan lava floods happened when Earth's crust split open as
India drifted away from Africa about 66 million years ago, allowing
huge volumes of molten rock to pour onto the landscape.
   The Columbia River basalts, which formed in massive eruptions
roughly 12 million to 20 million years ago, cover much of the
Pacific Northwest east of the Cascade Range.
   Magellan's $744 million map-making mission was suspended Oct. 26
because the sun is lined up almost directly between Venus and the
Earth, impairing communications between controllers and the
spacecraft. The suspension also was meant to allow engineers time
to fix Magellan's wobbling solar power panels.
   NASA hopes to resume mapping Saturday.

   Grimsvotn and Stromboli, Mount St. Helens and
Karkar, Etna and Nevada del Ruiz. The names conjure up drama and
disaster, a decade of human suffering and scientific inquiry into
the earth's volcanoes.
   Around the world, the erupting mountains that help emphasize the
unsettled nature of the planet become the subject of intense
curiosity when they initiate tragedy. Then they fade from center
stage, of interest only to scientists, relief workers and local
residents.
   Some of the researchers who chronicle and study these events
have now collected a decade's worth of records, major ones of great
impact and smaller eruptions notable for little beyond their
continuing threat.
   ``Global Volcanism 1975-1985'' is largely a scientific treatise,
yet within its 672 pages of text, charts and maps are detailed some
of the most dramatic events of a decade.
   ``An explosive eruption on 13 Nov melted ice and snow in the
summit area, generating lahars that flowed tens of kilometers down
flank river valleys, killing more than 22,000 people,'' begins the
report on Nevada del Ruiz, the Colombia volcano that became the
fourth deadliest volcano in history.
   Lahars, the geological term for massive mudflows generated by
volcanoes, came crashing down 11 narrow valleys into villages,
sweeping away or burying the thousands who made their homes and
lives there in November of 1985.
   ``A frightening noise and then a blast of wind hit us and we saw
fire falling from the sky,'' survivor E. Nieto told the scientists
that day.
   Compiled by the Smithsonian Institution, the new volume is
published by Prentice-Hall and the American Geophysical Union. It
collects reports from the first 10 years of the Smithsonian's
Scientific Event Alert Network. The network is a collection of
thousands of scientists around the world who study volcanoes,
earthquakes, meteors and other such events and share their findings
with one another.
   With scientific thoroughness, for example, they reported not
only that Nevada del Ruiz ranked fourth in volcano death tolls,
they listed the three events that were even worse: Tambora, 1815,
92,000 killed; Krakatau, 1883, 36,000 dead; Mt. Pelee, 1902, 28,000
fatalities.
   One of the editors of the new volume, Tom Simkin, the
Smithsonian's curator of petrology and volcanology, co-wrote an
earlier volume, ``Krakatau 1883.'' Others who joined in editing and
updating the network reports are Smithsonian researchers Lindsay
McClelland, Marjorie Summers, Elizabeth Nielsen and Thomas Stein.
   In addition to Nevada del Ruiz, the volume reports in detail on
Mount St. Helens in Washington, which is better known to Americans.
   Its May 1980 explosion claimed more than 50 lives, cost billions
of dollars in damage and cleanup and coated large parts of several
states with thick, gritty dust for days afterward. The mountain
remains active.
   The volume notes earthquake activity at thee other Cascade or
Sierra Nevada volcanoes during the period: Mount Hood, Ore.; Mount
Shasta, Calif., and Long Valley Caldera, Calif.
   Alaska gets a full chapter on its own, and Hawaii provides the
bulk of activity in the Central Pacific Ocean section.
   Among the more than 200 volcanoes reported in the volume are:
   _Stromboli, near Sicily, which began a new effusive phase in
November 1975, continuing a history of more than 2,000 years of
almost constant activity.
   _Etna, the volcano with the longest documented record in the
world, extending back to 1500 B.C. This Sicilian volcano continued
its tradition with several eruptions during the decade.
   _Grimsvotn, in Iceland, which erupted in both 1982 and 1983.
Located beneath an ice sheet, Grimsvotn melts the ice when it
erupts, flooding local streams and in 1983 produced large steam
clouds.
   _Karkar, off the coast of New Guinea, erupted with an explosive
blast of hot gas and debris March 8, 1979, killing two scientists
who had set up camp to study the volcano.
   Robin J.S. Cooke and Elias Ravian died in the blast, just over a
year before Mount St. Helens would kill another volcanologist,
David Johnston of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Oshima near Tokyo early Saturday and caused buildings to sway in
Tokyo, but no immediate sign of eruptions or reports of damage or
casualties followed.
   The quake struck at 6:20 a.m. It had a preliminary reading of
5.9 on the Richter scale on Oshima, nearly 75 miles south of the
Japanese capital, and in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, according
to the Central Meteorological Agency
   Meteorologists said the quake was centered 25 miles below the
ocean surface near Oshima.
   A Metropolitan Police Department official said police received
no reports of damage or injury.
   Mt. Mihara, an active volcano on Oshima, erupted in November
1986, spewing molten rock high into the air and forcing more than
11,000 people to evacuate. No direct casualties resulted, though
one person died later of a heart attack.
   A milder eruption occurred a year later. Oshima is part of an
island chain considered to be one of the most volcanically active
in the world.
   The open-ended Richter scale ia a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage
and one of magnitude 6, severe damage.

   Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of
stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of
Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several
volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks.
   ``We've had an increasing number of patients complaining of
insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions,'' said Mikio Kakefu, director of the National
Hospital in Ito City.
   Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486
strong enough to be felt, since June 30.
   On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast,
creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strong
earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday. No injuries or damages
were reported after the eruption.
   But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is
likely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock,
continues.
   Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatients
daily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches,
insomnia and diarrhea, ``all from fear and stress.''
   ``They didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption
because they were still tense,'' he said. Kakefu said he does not
have any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients is
likely to increase.
   Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly
after the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian.
   He said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the
``earthquake syndrome'' between July 4 and July 14.
   Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite were
frequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems including
rashes and hair loss, he said. He said some dogs were also afflicted
with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear.
   ``My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,''
Mochizuki said. ``Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in
people because animals are more sensitive, and they feel the
temblors and noises more strongly.''
   ``We humans have information from the municipal office and the
meteorological centers, which help to relieve our tensions ... but
such things don't work for animals,'' he said.

   An underwater volcano erupted Thursday off central
Japan, spewing plumes of smoke and ash into the air and creating
tremors that shook the Izu peninsula.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammed
telephone lines for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast of
Ito city, a seaside resort 62 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Hundreds of Ito's 72,000 residents fled, and city officials were
considering evacuating people living near the shore, according to
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. The Central Meteorological Agency
issued a navigation warning to ships in the area.
   The volcano erupted at 6:30 p.m. on the ocean floor at a depth of
330 feet, the Meteorological Agency said. Officials said earlier it
occurred at a depth of up to about 1,000 feet.
   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, larger
eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further
warnings,'' said an agency official. ``Obviously, there could be
danger to Ito if a larger eruption occurs,'' he said, requesting
anonymity.
   The Japanese archipelago is of volcanic origin, and 80 volcanoes
are believed to be active.
   For hours after the eruption, calls to the Ito Police Department
and City Hall were met with recorded messages asking callers to try
later due to ``extremely crowded lines.''
   Along with the strong jolt of the eruption, slight tremors,
possibly caused by the volcano, were felt throughout the evening,
said the official from the Meteorological Agency.
   Seismologists were surveying movements of underground magma in
the area. Large movements of magma can cause earthquakes, which
often preceed volcanic eruptions.
   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu over
the past two weeks.
   An official of the Seismic Division of the Central Meteorological
Agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nature of the
quakes had changed since Tuesday night, with the most recent quakes
occurring more frequently and lasting up to 20 seconds.
   On Wednesday, there were eight such temblors recorded, he said.
   Between June 30 and noon Thursday, 22,328 temblors were recorded
off the Izu peninsula, the Central Meteorological Agency said. Most
were at depths of two to 4.5 miles under the sea.
   Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakes
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.
