CONCORDE is for the seriously rich. A standard British Airways return fare
to New York costs Pounds 5,030 plus tax - Pounds 670 per hour on board -
while a cheap-day Concorde return is priced at Pounds 4,156.
It may be a soul-stirring experience to arrive in New York an hour and 10
minutes before you departed - the flight leaves daily at 10.30am and touches
down at JFK at 9.20am - but most souls can be stirred for a much more modest
sum.
Before you despair of breaking the sound barrier, however, there may be
cheaper options. Be warned, though: I said cheaper options; cheap I did not
say.
For the absolute miser - in Concorde terms this represents someone with
Pounds 500 or so to blow on 20 minutes of supersonic bliss - you could fly
to France. Paris Travel Service (tel: 0920-467-467) has chartered Concorde
five times next year and will, for Pounds 598, whisk you to Paris for a
night. On the outbound flight, Concorde takes a detour over the Bay of
Biscay where it slips into supersonic realms. Returnees limp home on
scheduled subsonic flights. The first 1993 departure is April 25.
The same company sometimes has last-minute deals on unsold seats, which it
sells as day trips, usually for a little under Pounds 300.
Goodwood Travel (0227-764-949) specialises in Concorde charters and has, in
its nine-year history, flown to 39 destinations. Next year you can be sped
to St Petersburg (for the Kirov), Moscow (for the Bolshoi), Monaco (for the
grand prix) or Cairo (for the hell of it). Prices range from about Pounds
925 (Paris) to Pounds 2,250 (Egypt, including a seven-day Nile cruise and
time in Luxor).
If you get your skates on, you could fly to Finnish Lappland for Christmas,
including the opportunity - should you wish - of visiting the Santa Claus
village. Goodwood's Lappland departures this month start at Pounds 1,295.
Another Concorde idea for the festive season is the so-called Atlantic Time
Tunnel which offers the chance to celebrate New Year's Eve twice in the same
year. Passengers, paying Pounds 3,999, celebrate the end of 1992 in Shannon,
in the west of Ireland, until half-past-midnight, at which point their
champagne is confiscated and they are herded on to Concorde for the
three-hour flight to Bermuda. Here they become acquainted with their old
friend 1993 for the second time that evening.
The Guinness Book of Records will be monitoring the event which, if
successful, will be a world first. Two nights later, Concorde takes you on
to New York for a Bloomingdale's reception (Dollars 10,000 to spend for one
lucky passenger) and from there, on January 3, back to London. For bookings,
contact Hogg Robinson (081-897-2525).
For those who prefer their supersonic travel at a more leisurely pace,
Elegant Resorts (0244-329-671) can fix you up with Concorde extravaganzas to
Barbados. For Pounds 2,775 you can secure seven nights in a Treasure Beach
ocean view suite (b&amp;b), flying out on Concorde and back on BWIA first class.
The standard Concorde return fare to Barbados is Pounds 4,228.
On most of the packages mentioned, your planemates are likely to include
those for whom Concorde is something special: honeymooners, those
celebrating anniversaries and romantics with long-cherished supersonic
dreams. They will not be those for whom Concorde is merely a rapid means of
shuttling between important meetings in London, New York and Washington.
Your fellow travellers are likely to celebrate the supersonic experience
with champagne, caviar and an expedition to the cockpit. Scheduled
passengers, by all accounts, spend the 3 1/2 -hour transatlantic trip
looking underwhelmed (but smart), sipping carbonated water, waving away
expensive food and giving the impression that, for them, Concorde is a
weekly event.

   By PAUL TAYLOR


THIRTY YEARS ago the British and French governments finally gave the
go-ahead for the world's first supersonic airliner, the Concorde project.
But it was January 1976 before Concorde's first commercial flight and
another 10 years shuttling backwards and forwards over the Atlantic before
British Airways was able to report that the aircraft was making a healthy
profit.
Despite all the initial optimism of the 1960s, when the project's cost was
put at Pounds 80m and Britain and France were hoping to sell more than 400
aircraft, only 16 were actually built and the overall cost eventually
reached Pounds 2bn.
Nevertheless, Concorde came into its own in the 1980s economic boom as
captains of industry and finance, pop stars and sport personalities climbed
aboard the 100-seater aircraft to cross the Atlantic in style and on time
rather than worry about the cost.
For them the premium New York return fare of Pounds 5,000 is justified by
the savings in travelling time offered by Concorde. With mid-morning
departures from London and Paris the busy senior executive has time to sort
out his desk before departure and still be in New York's JFK airport at
9.30am the same day (or 9am on the Air France flight) after a flight of just
3 1/2 hours.
Inevitably, the recession and the cost-cutting plans of the 1990s have
forced some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives
by Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers, of whom some
travel every week, and those individuals who are willing to pay the
supersonic premium to arrive fresh.
In addition, Concorde continues to attract a busy charter business. Mr W. D.
(Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde says the airline
remains 'very happy with our Concorde operation; it has a beautiful niche.'
In spite of Concorde's age, Mr Lowe says BA 'has every intention of keeping
it flying well into the next century'. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that it
will be necessary to replace Concorde one day. Since the benefits of
supersonic flight are 'enormous', he has no doubt that Concorde will be
superseded by a second generation supersonic aircraft.
'It took just over 60 years to get from the Wright Brothers to Concorde. It
is not a case of 'if', it's a case of 'when', and it's 'when' that will
decide what we end up with,' he says. His enthusiasm appears to be shared by
others, in particular by the informal seven-nation group of companies which
has quietly been examining the feasibility for a successor to Concorde -
dubbed rather unflatteringly, the High Speed Commercial Transport (HSCT).
For several years, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US, Aerospatiale of
France, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany have been
studying the possibility of such an aircraft. More recently, they have been
joined by Italian, Russian and Japanese industry representatives in the
Supersonic Commercial Transport International Co-operation Study Group, or
more informally 'the supersonic club'.
The group has been concentrating on three main issues, the technological
requirements for a second generation supersonic airliner, environmental
considerations and finally the potential market for the new jet. Mr Bob
McKinlay, who heads BAe's Airbus programme, says that although there are
still technical and other unresolved issues, the group's preliminary
conclusion 'is that there don't seem to be any show stoppers'.
Like the airlines, the aerospace industry believes the only real questions
are when a new supersonic aircraft will be built, and who will be in the
final consortium. The study project is being pushed forward in stages, but
the consensus view is that, providing no insurmountable technological
hurdles are encountered, the go-ahead could be given soon after the end of
the decade and that the aircraft could be in service somewhere between 2005
and 2010.
Convincing others outside the industry, especially environmentalists and the
governments that will probably have to subscribe most of the Dollars
5bn-plus cost, is likely to be as difficult as agreeing on a design in which
the manufacturers can share. But time is running out if the option of
travelling at supersonic speed is to be continuously maintained.
By the turn of the century Concorde will have been in regular service for
nearly 25 years. That is normally about the maximum life-span for an
airliner, although Concorde's annual usage is much lower. Nevertheless, if
any HSCT is to enter service in the early part of the next century, much of
the preliminary research and development must be undertaken in the current
decade.
Perhaps the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go
ahead with a 'son of Concorde' is the likely market for supersonic travel.
Concorde, with its payload of only 100 seats, has always been viewed as a
'top persons' airliner', with a premium fare which has limited its market.
But there is now a wider appreciation of the benefits of faster travel, as
more people fly longer non-stop distances. By 2000, it is believed that
long-distance traffic will have doubled in volume, stimulated by such
new-generation subsonic long-range airliners such as the Airbus A-340,
Boeing 747-400 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
There are differing views about the size of the potential market. Some
believe that demand in the first quarter of the next century could justify
up to as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth some Dollars
200-300bn, collectively carrying up to as many as 600,000 passengers a day.
But European analysts, with the reality of Concorde behind them, tend to be
more cautious, assessing the market at no more than a few hundred or so
aircraft.
To be commercially viable, the next generation of supersonic airliners will
have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly slightly faster and have a
significantly longer range. Although he emphasises no formal decision to go
ahead has been taken, Mr McKinlay believes any new supersonic aircraft would
need to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, fly at between Mach 2 and
Mach 2.25 and have a range in excess of 5,500 miles compared to Concorde's
3,500 miles.
The range is critical because it would open up new high density routes such
as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia, for instance
Los Angeles to Tokyo. But to achieve ranges of that order, the new aircraft
will need to utilise high technology, low weight materials and a specialised
power plant - probably a form of variable cycle engine which would help it
meet some of the environmental noise objections while flying at subsonic
speeds.
Such an aircraft could cut many long distance journey times in half and help
attract new travellers to supersonic flight. Nevertheless fares, although
perhaps not as high as Concorde, will probably still reflect a technology
premium for supersonic travel.
The HSCT will be expensive to build and is likely to face even more severe
environmental demands than Concorde in terms of noise levels and pollution.
Meeting those demands will be difficult technologically and financially -
far beyond the capabilities of any one company. There is no doubt that the
HSCT, whenever it is built, will have to be a consortium venture.

scheduled service between London and Washington DC after 18 years.
BA, which will continue to operate its profitable twice-daily London-New
York Concorde services, plans to develop supersonic charter flights for the
US market.
After the end of its thrice-weekly scheduled Concorde Washington service
from November 8 BA will permanently base one of its seven Concordes at New
York's JFK airport.
The airline yesterday said there was increasing US demand for Concorde
charter flights.
BA has already won business to operate a weekly Concorde charter flight
between New York and Barbados for three months starting in December. The
flight takes two hours and 20 minutes - half the subsonic journey time.
BA said: 'We see possibilities for expanding charter services from New York
to South America, Bermuda and Mexico.'
The scheduled Washington service, which was Concorde's first transatlantic
route, has averaged passenger loads of only 30 per cent compared with an
average of about 70 per cent for the New York service, which has round-trip
ticket prices of more than Pounds 5,000.
The suspension of BA's service to Washington's Dulles airport means that New
York is the only US destination served by regular supersonic scheduled
services from London Heathrow - operated by BA - and Paris Charles de
Gaulle, operated by Air France.
Air France has already stopped scheduled Concorde flights between Paris and
Washington.

CONCORDE reached a signif-icant milestone yesterday by completing 250,000
supersonic flying hours in commercial service with British Airways but the
aircraft is showing signs of its age.
The UK carrier said the supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more
than all the supersonic flying hours completed by the combined air forces of
the west since the introduction of supersonic combat aircraft.
This achievement comes as the Anglo-French airliner, which began commercial
service with BA and Air France in 1976, has suffered a series of technical
problems. These include the loss of parts of its rudder during supersonic
flight on three occasions since 1989.
BA is now subjecting Concorde rudders to scrupulous checks after every five
flights compared with normal inspections after each 50 to 100 flights. It
has also commissioned new rudders from British Aerospace at a cost of about
Pounds 5m to be fitted on all BA's seven Concordes.
The company said yesterday the first new rudder would be fitted in November.
Both BA and Air France want to stretch the working life of the aircraft into
the next century in an effort to continue supersonic services until a second
generation supersonic airliner is developed to replace Concorde.
Without modifications, Concorde is expected to reach its operational limit
by 1998-99.
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale, the two Concorde airframe manufacturers,
as well as Rolls-Royce and Snecma of France, the engine suppliers, are
working with the two airlines to make design adjustments and improvements to
extend Concorde's operational life to 2005 or possibly 2010.
Both UK and French airworthiness authorities are satisfied Concorde remains
safe and the rudder incidents did not represent a serious risk to the
air-craft.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said Concorde had to have its certificate
of airworthiness renewed each year.
The aircraft were 'monitored on a continuous basis and have to be maintained
in accordance to a very strict maintenance schedule to anticipate any
eventual problems'.

From the British Airways headquarters at London's Heathrow airport,
mechanics could be seen examining the rudder of a Concorde sticking out of
the big hangar known as Technical Block B.
The rudders of each of BA's seven Concordes, the flagships of the airline's
fleet, are normally inspected after every 50 to 100 flights. But BA is now
subjecting this section of the aircraft to minute checks after every five
flights. This follows a series of incidents in which parts of the rudder
have fallen off in supersonic flight, although none represented a serious
risk to the aircraft.
For BA, the UK airworthiness and air accident authorities, and the
manufacturers, Concorde's rudder problems have been an embarrassment. They
have also raised questions on how much longer the world's only supersonic
passenger jet, which entered regular service with BA and Air France more
than 15 years ago, can continue flying and whether a new generation of
supersonic aircraft will eventually be developed to replace it.
Since 1989, three BA Concordes have lost large sections of their rudders in
mid-flight, most recently on March 21, when a New York-bound Concorde lost
most of the upper section of its two-piece rudder while flying at 56,000 ft
at Mach 2, or roughly 1,300 mph.
In all three cases, the aircraft, which yesterday completed 250,000
supersonic flying hours in commercial service with BA, flew safely to its
destination. 'It's not critical, but the fact it happened more than once
makes it serious,' says Mr Alistair Cumming, BA's director of engineering.
To leave nothing to chance, BA has now asked British Aerospace, responsible
for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for
its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m.
Although the new equipment is expected to resolve the fault, the rudder
failures are signs that the aircraft is showing its age. BA said the
supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more than the supersonic
flying hours completed by the combined air forces of the west since the
introduction of supersonic combat aircraft. And unlike subsonic jets,
Concorde has had to operate in more stressful conditions with the aircraft
subjected to more intensive and frequent changes of temperature when flying
at Mach 2.
Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness
authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights. BA's
supersonic jets have already completed about 4,000 flights and are expected
to reach their current operational limit by 1998-99.
BA and Air France, together with the airframe manufacturers (BAe and
Aerospatiale) and the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), are working
to try to extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines hope to
stretch the life of Concorde until 2010.
This will require design adjustments and improvements on which the airlines
and the manufacturers are already working. Mr Cumming said BA would be
fitting one of its operational aircraft with instruments to measure the
stress on the airframe structures to provide the information to tackle any
structural weaknesses and potential areas of distress.
'It could involve lots of small things like changing the radius of certain
components facing high stress or polishing a surface,' he said. On older
subsonic aircraft, airlines and manufacturers usually wait until a crack
appears on the airframe before taking action. But Mr Cumming said it would
clearly be unwise to adopt the same procedure for Concorde.
The airlines expect the cost of improving the Concorde structure to be
relatively small since adjustments would be phased in during the already
exhaustive maintenance programme of each aircraft. Averaged out over a year,
every Concorde undergoes 22 hours of maintenance for every one hour of
flight compared with seven hours of maintenance for a Boeing 747 jumbo.
Although it was hit last year by the slump in airline traffic and the
general squeeze on first class travel, Concorde in recent years has operated
profitably for BA and Air France. Apart from regular transatlantic services,
the two airlines have also developed successful charter businesses for their
supersonic jet.
But for all its technical achievements, Concorde remains an economic
failure. The profits BA and Air France make on their supersonic operations
include no depreciation charge on the aircraft's Pounds 1.2bn development
cost. And if the cost of keeping Concorde in service should suddenly jump
and huge sums be necessary to refurbish and re-equip the aircraft, the
airlines would have to re-examine the economics of their Concorde
operations.
Apart from modifications to stretch the aircraft's working life, spare parts
are likely to pose another big problem. Scores of different small components
from a myriad of suppliers will have to be manufactured, redesigned or
replaced. Careful planning, according to Mr Cumming, will be critical to
avoid the risk of spares running short and eventually grounding the
aircraft.
The challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines is to keep Concorde
flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready to replace it.
The aerospace industry has already begun preliminary studies on developing a
supersonic aircraft about three times the size of Concorde. It would carry
up to 300 passengers, compared with the 100 carried by Concorde, at Mach 2
over longer ranges.
But such an aircraft is unlikely to be developed before 2005-2010 at the
earliest. It is expected to cost more than Dollars 10bn at 1992 prices and
will need an unprecedented amount of international co-operation.
All leading airframe and en-gine companies agree to co-operate. 'It would be
very difficult for one company or one country to develop such an aircraft
because of the big market and financial risks involved,' said Mr Mike
Henderson, head of the supersonic research team at Boeing.
The project faces a series of daunting questions: can international
co-operation on such a scale work; will the manufacturers overcome hugely
complex environmental issues to ensure no perceptible sonic boom over
populated areas and no significant ozone depletion; can such an aircraft
ultimately be economic?
'We are going to have to demonstrate that the aircraft is environmentally
safe and show it is not just a toy for the rich,' Mr Henderson said.
The industry is relatively confident it can overcome all the technical
challenges of developing a new supersonic airliner. But Boeing research has
shown that passengers appear willing to pay only relatively modest
surcharges for supersonic flights of 10-20 per cent over subsonic fares.
'Concorde was a technological success but also a good example of something
possible but not very useful for the market,' Mr Henderson said.
The message is clear. The industry is unlikely to develop another
technological showpiece that makes little commercial sense. Instead, the
market will decide when and if a new supersonic airliner is built.

Concorde's daughter could be a seductive creature. She could combine the
slender graceful lines of her parent with the power to dominate the world of
business travel. With her extra endurance she could reach across the Pacific
Ocean and link Europe with Asia in five hours. Her extra strength could lift
250 people instead of the 100 that cram into her aged ancestor.
So it is not surprising that British Aerospace, together with Aerospatiale
of France and Deutsche Aerospace, proposed on Thursday to bring her closer
to reality. They now want government money and European Union funds to
continue feasibility studies. They are asking for most of the Pounds 60m
they say is needed to step up such studies.
Independent experts and airline chiefs, however, believe that few of the
other numbers add up.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the market for Concorde's
daughter is of the order of 100 aircraft - far short of the 500 to 1,000
that the three partners regard as necessary to set up a profitable
production line.
The calculation runs as follows: Concorde's daughter would attract almost
entirely business passengers. At a capacity of 250, that is the equivalent
of roughly 2 1/2 Boeing 747 business-class cabins. Because she would take
less than half as long to do the journey she is twice as productive. You can
double again because, at an optimistic guess, half the current
business-class passengers on a route such as Los Angeles to Tokyo might be
prepared to pay for a premium-priced ticket.
That gives each new Concorde the capacity currently satisfied by 10 Boeing
747s. The 747 is the standard aircraft for long-haul flights and there have
been 1,000 sold since 1970, giving a market of 100 for Concorde's child.
These kinds of calculations convince City analysts that there is no real
chance of the project taking off. Nor do the airlines who would buy her
believe the project should be taken too seriously.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, which has been the
world's biggest carrier by sales for several years, dismisses the idea of a
new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft principally because the
project would be too expensive.
Mr Sash Tusa, an analyst with stockbroker UBS, says that the commercial cost
of each of Concorde's daughters would be 'several hundred million dollars'
compared with the price of a subsonic 250-seater of less than Dollars 100m.
Mr Crandall adds that there are too many environmental issues to be
overcome. These include the sonic boom and damage to the ozone layer from an
aircraft that flies much higher than conventional aeroplanes.
Mr Rod Muddle, director of planning at British Airways, says that the market
estimate of 100 aircraft is reasonable but only a radical design
breakthrough would make the aircraft a commercial proposition.
'If it had running costs about 20 per cent higher than a conventional
aircraft then we could offer tickets at a small premium price and enough
passengers would switch,' he said. Running costs per passenger for today's
Concorde are 'several times' those for a Boeing 747, he says.
British Airways and Air France would probably be the first buyers of a new
supersonic passenger aircraft because their Concorde fleets will become too
old to continue flying soon after the year 2005, which is when British
Aerospace says the new aircraft would be ready.
However the real need for BA and other airlines, especially the Asian
operators, is not for glamour but size. Airports are already overcrowded.
Larger aircraft would allow more people to fly without trying to trying to
cram in more aircraft.
'The timing of the new supersonic aircraft project is bad,' says Mr Muddle.
'The investment is going to be tens of billions of pounds. It should be
first spent on a 600-seater aircraft that flies at less than the speed of
sound.'

PORTHOLE CRACKS PROMPT CONCORDE TO ABORT FLIGHT ACROSS ATLANTIC 




From Associated Press 




PARIS 




A supersonic Concorde jet en route to New York with 69 passengers returned to 
Paris after cracks appeared in a porthole as the plane was nearly halfway 
across the Atlantic, Air France said Monday. 


Air France Flight 001 was at 59,000 feet and had just reached supersonic speed 
Sunday when the cracks were noticed at the top of the outermost of four glass 
plates in one porthole, said Air France spokesman Laurent Kressman. 


He said he does not know who first noticed the cracks about 90 minutes into the 
3 hour and 45 minute flight. 


The pilot slowed the jet, dropped to 32,000 feet and returned to Charles de 
Gaulle airport, Kressman said. 


Passengers were put aboard another Concorde, but departure was delayed, and 
travelers on the high-tech jet arrived about nine hours after the normal 
arrival time for the trans-Atlantic Air France flight to New York. 


"They were not very, very happy," said Kressman.

   From Sir PETER MASEFIELD


Sir, The FT's normally perceptive attitude towards technological development
(one of its instructive and welcome features) was woefully,
uncharacteristically and surprisingly lacking in its negative, anti-SST
leading article 'Supersonic subsidies' (April 11).
As the history of science and transport makes clear, in due course a
dramatic advance on Concorde - larger, of longer range, quieter,
environmentally acceptable and of much better economics - will certainly be
funded, developed and introduced, profitably, by the world's big airlines on
to intercontinental routes. The question is not 'if', but 'when'.
Experience - and Concorde (first flown 25 years ago in 1969) - has shown
that, at the competitive fares which can, and must, be achieved for its
successor, a wide market exists for non-stop services over longer distances,
with flying times cut to less than half those of subsonic jets. Hence, the
current joint studies by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Dasa for an
eventual, but by no means final, successor to Concorde is a logical,
sensible and commercially profitable advance along the path of human
progress.
During the past 38 years, there have been dramatic advances in all aspects
of supersonic technology: in materials, structures, systems, aerodynamics
and computer-controlled engine characteristics and performance. Aeronautical
progress, only glimpsed when Concorde first flew, will not be cast aside,
nor left to become no more than history.
Fortunately - as with earlier aircraft - the service lives of existing
Concordes can be extended, usefully and safely, into the next century
through the process of computerised continuous maintenance. Thus there need
be no gap in supersonic transatlantic services while the next generation of
SSTs is explored, developed and brought on stream, to follow the next series
of much larger, subsonic aircraft.

By the end of the 1990s, Concorde will have been carrying commercial
passengers at supersonic speeds for almost a quarter of a century, having
entered commercial service in 1976.
Normally 25 years is about the maximum life-span for an airliner, but
Concorde's relatively low annual utilisation rate, compared to subsonic
jets, and its intensive maintenance schedule mean it will probably be able
to continue flying well into the next century.
Nevertheless, Concorde was designed in the 1960s and inevitably even its
most ardent admireres are beginning to ask what comes next.
There is already much interest in the world airline and aerospace industry
in the development of a second-generation supersonic airliner - or High
Speed Commercial Transport - to replace Concorde.
It is unlikely, however, that any HSCT could emerge before the year 2005 at
the earliest. Before any successor to Concorde could be built, key
technological, environmental and commercial economics issues must be
addressed.
The HSCT would be expensive to build - some estimates have suggested it
could cost Dollars 15bn or more to develop - and it is likely to face even
more severe environmental restrictions than Concorde in terms of noise
levels and pollution.
No single company can afford that sort of money - particularly with other
large subsonic aircraft studies such as the 800-seat Ultra-High Capacity
Aircraft under way.
A single US-led international effort to share the research and development
costs of the HSCT probably stands the best chance of success, but
multinational consortia are notoriously difficult to assemble and manage.
Nevertheless, an informal start has already been made.
The leading airframe manufacturers in the US (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas),
western Europe (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace) and
in Russia and Japan have been working on many aspects of the HSCT for some
time, together with the engine manufacturers.
Among the issues, noise will be especially critical. The HSCT's engines will
need to be much quieter than those of Concorde in order to use existing
airports and meet international aircraft noise regulations which have been
progressively toughened in recent years.
The engines will also have to be much more efficient, in order to save fuel
and keep down operating costs while also reducing, if not eliminating,
pollutant emissions, especially nitrous oxides in the upper atmosphere.
This may mean turning to new forms of engine, perhaps using combined-cycle
turbofan-ramjet technology which is being studied in Japan and elsewhere.
The aircraft will also need to make considerable use of low-weight, high
temperature-resistant materials, such as ceramics and new composites capable
of coping with the extremely high temperatures that will be generated both
inside the engines and on the aircraft skin during the longer periods of
sustained and faster supersonic cruise that Concorde is called upon to
perform.
But although there are still many unresolved technical and other problems,
the aerospace industry's general view appears to be that none of these are
insurmountable.
Probably the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go
ahead with an HSCT is the likely market for supersonic travel.
Although Concorde has been operated profitably by British Airways and Air
France since the mid-1980s, no provision has been made for depreciation
costs on an aircraft that cost Pounds 1.2bn to develop.
With its payload of only 100 seats, Concord may be an engineering triumph,
but its premium fares have always limited its market appeal.
To be commercially viable, the industry believes that the next generation of
supersonic airliners will probably have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly
slightly faster and have a significantly longer range.
The HSCT probably needs to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, cruise
at around Mach 2.4 (1,500mph) compared to Concorde's Mach 2, and have a
range in excess of 5,000 miles compared to Concorde's 3,500 miles.
The range is critical because it would open up new high-density routes such
as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia.
For example, the Los Angeles to Tokyo route could be flown non-stop in about
4.3 hours, instead of today's subsonic 10.3 hours.
However research suggests that most passengers are willing to pay only a
relatively modest 'supersonic premium' of 10-20 per cent over subsonic
fares.
There are strikingly different estimates of the potential market size for a
new HSCT. The most optimistic suggest that demand in the first quarter of
the next century could reach as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth
some Dollars 200bn-Dollars 300bn.
However, more conservative estimates suggest that if such an aircraft could
be built at an economic cost the market might run to several hundred
aircraft at most.
While small in comparison with many subsonic jets built over the past 40
years, that would still make it exceptionally successful compared with the
total of 16 Concordes that originally entered service with BA and Air France
 -reduced to 13 in use today by the need for spares.
The requirement for a 'spares pool' serves as a reminder of Concorde's
creeping middle age.
Perhaps the real challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines will be to
keep Concorde flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready
to replace it.
Last year, BA's seven Concordes completed 250,000 commercial supersonic
flying hours - more than the combined air forces of the west since the
introduction of supersonic combat aircraft.
In some areas the strain is beginning to show. Last year, BA began even more
frequent checks following a series of incidents since 1989 in which parts of
Concorde's rudder fell off during supersonic flight.
None of the incidents represented a serious risk to the aircraft, but they
were an embarrasment. Subsequently, BA asked British Aerospace, responsible
for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for
its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m.
Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness
authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights.
BA's fleet of Concordes has already completed more than 4,000 flights and is
expected to reach its current operational limit by 1998-99.
The airline operators, the airframe manufacturers (BAe and Aerospatiale) and
the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), have been working to try to
extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines in particular
hope to stretch the life of Concorde until 2010.
In the meantime, BA's Concorde fleet is being given an interior facelift.
Eight years after the last refurbishment Concord is getting improved seats -
with a folding central arm rest - new decor and galleys.
The 1980s provided Concorde with a significant boost as captains of industry
and finance, pop stars and sports personalities climbed aboard to cross the
Atlantic in style and on time rather than worry about the cost.
Inevitably, the recession and the cost-consciousness of the 1990s has forced
some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives by
Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers.
Mr W. D. (Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde, says the
airline remains 'very happy' with the Concorde operation and is confident
that the service will continue well into the next century. He says the
transatlantic flights are currently achieving an average load factor of 60
to 70 per cent.
Apart from regular transatlantic services, BA has run scheduled winter
flights to Barbados for the past four years which Mr Lowe says 'are busier
than ever,' and both BA and Air France have also developed successful
charter businesses for their supersonic jet.

P.M. BRIEFING; 


SUPERSONIC FLIGHT AROUND WORLD SET 




From Times wire services 




NEW YORK 




A British Airways Concorde jet with some well-heeled passengers aboard will 
make the first all-supersonic flight around the world beginning April 1, the 
British airline announced today. 


The three-week trip, covering 38,215 miles in a planned total flying time of 35 
hours and 1 minute, could set more than a dozen world speed records, British 
Airways said. The average speed of the supersonic jet will be 1,091.3 m.p.h. 


The trip will start in London on April 1 and finish there on April 23. The 
Concorde aircraft, part of British Airways' fleet, has been chartered by 
Lorraine Travel Bureau Inc., a tour operator based in Miami. The fare is 
$39,000 per person based on double occupancy or $40,500 for a single passenger. 


The round-trip fare on normal Concorde flights, between New York and London, 
for example, is about $6,400.

HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland
Bank, has taken a further provision of Dollars 61.4m (Pounds 40.6m) against
Concord Leasing, its troubled US equipment leasing business.
This comes just two months after it announced the resignation of Concord's
senior management, together with a Dollars 100m cash injection and Dollars
75m provision.
The latest write-down followed a review of Concord's entire asset portfolio.
HSBC said it had established general provisions sufficient to support
Concord's continuing business activities, in addition to taking 'specific
provisions for all identified weaknesses in Concord's asset portfolio.'
The initial Dollars 75m write-down taken in September was against Concord's
ageing shipping portfolio, and raised concerns over insufficient management
control from the parent company.
Concord had assets of Dollars 2.17bn in December 1991, and analysts had
considered further provisions to be inevitable. The latest charge was taken
in the quarter ended September 1992.
HSBC has appointed Mr Matthew Colasanti as president and chief executive for
Concord. However, Mr David Budd, a senior HSBC executive from Hong Kong, has
been appointed chief operating officer. HSBC said that Concord planned to
remain active in the leasing business, despite the impact of the US
recession.
Since HSBC's successful takeover of Midland in June it has also taken a
Dollars 187.5m provision against its exposure to Olympia &amp; York. The banking
group made total provisions of HKDollars 4.48bn (Pounds 381m) against bad
and doubtful debts at the interim stage.

The bearded entrepreneur, whose BA call sign is the 'grinning pullover', is
desperate to go supersonic and has been in secret talks with impoverished
Air France to borrow three of its Concordes.
The chance of Branson Concordes in Virgin livery competing head-on with the
marketing flagship of British Airways' fleet on the London to New York route
would cause apoplexy at BA's Speedbird House, particularly as Branson talks
happily of BA's Concorde seating being too cramped.
Bernard Attali, Air France's former chairman, was 'extremely keen', says
Branson. But talks have stalled since Attali lost his job last autumn. 'Once
we've got the Delta deal done, we hope to pop over to Paris and have a
little talk with Air France,' says Branson mischievously.

The development of a second-generation supersonic airliner to succeed the
Anglo-French Concorde depends on two factors - satisfactory financing and
production arrangements and solving the outstanding technological
difficulties, especially those affecting the environment.
Few doubt that such an aircraft will eventually emerge, although it is now
accepted that its likely birthdate may be around 2010 to 2015.
By 2000, Concorde will have been in service with British Airways and Air
France for nearly 25 years, so that every year thereafter heightens the
possibility of either a diminution of existing supersonic services as
Concordes age and are 'cannibalised' for spares, or a gap of some years
before a successor emerges.
Despite the aerospace industry's desire to start developing a successor,
there is little enthusiasm for such an aircraft among the world's leading
airlines, faced as they are with their cumulative losses of more than
Dollars 15bn over the past four years. They are more inclined to spend their
available cash on airliners that are more likely to meet mass market
demands, help reduce congestion and generate profits, than on
second-generation supersonic transports. As a result, they are far more
interested in a new subsonic 500-plus seater, the so-called megajumbo, than
a second-generation supersonic transport.
Moreover, the airlines remain suspicious about the financial and
environmental acceptability of an SST-2.
The two airlines flying Concordes, British Airways and Air France, have made
it clear that while they may be interested in the long-term in any SST-2,
they want to be absolutely sure that such an aircraft is profitable to buy
and fly from the start, and totally acceptable in every way to the
communities it will serve. They are keenly aware that government-imposed
environmental constraints upon the airlines and aerospace industries are
likely to become even more stringent in the next century, and such an
aircraft, may well face environmental constraints that have not yet even
been defined.
The SST-2 research so far has been concentrated on an aircraft seating 300
passengers (against Concorde's 100), with a range of about 5,600 to 6,000
nautical miles (against Concorde's 3,000), and a speed of around about
1,500mph.
Despite the undeniable advances in research into supersonic transport
technology since Concorde first went into service in 1976, especially in the
reduction of nitrous oxide emissions (N0x), the latter remain a problem.
There is also still no answer to the sonic boom created by large aircraft
flying at twice the speed of sound even at high altitude. This means that
future supersonic services would still be largely restricted to over-ocean
routes, with subsonic flights over land masses. This, in turn, means that
interest in such aircraft is likely to be confined to those airlines with a
substantial number of long-distance over-ocean flights in their overall
operational patterns.
There is also the problem of development cost, likely to be between Dollars
8bn-10bn, or about the same as the cost of any subsonic megajumbo. It is
doubtful whether aerospace industries could finance both developments in
tandem.
Although demand for the megajumbo may be limited - with perhaps only a score
or so airlines likely to support it initially - its ultimate market seems
likely to be significantly larger than that for a second-generation SST. The
airlines believe that the subsonic megajumbo is more likely to improve their
battered balance sheets.
Another reason for airline scepticism about the SST-2 is that while much
technical research is under way, especially in the US through the
government-sponsored National Aeronautics and Space Administration, there is
still no sign of a coherent and practicable design, development, production
and marketing plan for such an aircraft.
While theoretically the airlines might prefer to have competitive designs
from which to choose, industrial and financial logic dictates that one
common design would stand more chance of economic and technological success.
But any kind of agreement on such a formula appears to be a long way off.
There have been wide-ranging international discussions between the US
manufacturers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and their European
counterparts, British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Alenia of Italy and DASA of
Germany, with both Russian and Japanese companies also involved, on the
possibilities of an eventual joint venture.
At the same time, however, the US and European companies have also been
pursuing their individual studies.
The balance appears strongly to favour the US at present in terms of
government financial involvement. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been,
and still are being pumped into aeronautical research through NASA's own
high-speed research programme, and by the leading engine and airframe
manufacturers. There is no comparable coherent programme in Europe.
Concerned at this situation, the leading European manufacturers earlier this
summer told their respective governments and the EU that some level of state
and/or community input to help research into a Concorde successor was
essential, so as to ensure that Europe did not fall behind the US. So far,
however, there has been little sign of any such cash support. Any single
SST-2 venture would also probably have to be global anyway, to ensure the
widest spread of costs and the biggest possible market. Whether US
anti-trust laws would permit such an alliance remains a significant query.
Demands for cash to finance the renewal of much of the existing ageing
subsonic fleet are already heavy, and will escalate as traffic grows and
fleet expansion becomes imperative. Lenders other than governments seem more
likely to favour the procurement of a subsonic megajumbo, offering some
guarantee of successful financial returns, than any SST-2 venture.

THE view across Place de la Concorde from the Hotel de Crillon is, or so
said Victor Hugo, the 19th century French writer, the most beautiful view in
the world.
Hugo, of course, saw the Place de la Concorde without all the cars and
coaches that honk their horns and belch out fumes around the obelisk today.
But the view from the suites along the Crillon's facade is still stunning
particularly at night when the 19th century lamps are lit and you can look
out over the trees of the Tuileries gardens to the giant clocks of Musee
d'Orsay on the other side of the Seine.
Even if you plump for a more modest room along the side of the hotel, the
Crillon positively oozes opulence. The whole hotel has been restored over
the past few years, from the sumptuous marble lobby with its forests of
flowers festooned on Louis XVI tables, to Jacques-Ange Gabriel's 18th
century facade.
The Crillon is still a very French establishment. Even the royal suites
along Place de la Concorde are small, certainly by American standards, and
there are none of the amenities, the multi-gyms or swimming pools, that a
Montana millionaire might expect from one of the very grandest European
hotels.
But the Crillon more than compensates with its glossy blend of icy elegance
and comfort, classical French style at its best. The rooms are decked out in
powder blue and white, with glacial glass chandeliers and gold leaf inlaid
in the woodwork. All the hardware that all too often messes up the
aesthetics of modern hotel rooms, including the mini bar, is discreetly
hidden away, although even the Crillon has yet to find a way of hiding the
black-clad bodyguards that hang out around the rooms of its
security-sensitive guests.
Best of all, the marble bathrooms are arranged in suites of tiny rooms, so
that the bath, bidet, shower and make-up area, are completely separate from
the bedrooms themselves. There are also walk-in wardrobes, with plenty of
drawers and hanging space, so that even the smallest rooms need never be
cluttered up by baggage, however long your stay. The staff even leave a
little weather guide by your bed each night with a forecast for the coming
day.
Foodies need not stir from the hotel. Les Ambassadeurs ranks as one of
Paris' finest restaurants thanks to Christian Constant's classic French
cuisine. It also has one of the most stunning settings, with its glowing
marble walls and the afternoon sun streaming in from Place de la Concorde.
L'Obelisque offers less formal fare from Andre Signoret's kitchens at the
Grand Vefour on Palais Royal, in its art nouveau-style restaurant, prettily
decorated in red velvet banquettes.
Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la
Concorde, 75008; tel: 4265 2424.
Rooms: FFr2,300 to FFr3,300.
Suites: FFr4,600 to FFr24,000.

  [Text] Paris (DPA) -- Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), French 
Aerospatiale, and British Aerospace have agreed on joint 
research for a new supersonic passenger plane. This program, 
PERS, has the goal of producing a follow-up model for the 
French-British Concorde in the next century, the companies 
announced on Thursday [7 April]. 
  The work, which extends over several years, would be 
financed 
by the three companies in equal shares. According to the plans, 
the new plane is to have a range of 10,000 km and be able to 
carry 250 passengers. It is to fly with a speed of 2,000 km per 
hour (Mach 2). The companies pointed out that long-distance 
flying is increasing constantly. It is estimated that, in the 
year 2005, 50 million people per year will fly either across the 
Atlantic, from Europe to Asia, or from Asia to North America. 
Given the fact that 500 to 1,000 planes will then probably be 
wanted on the market, only some kind of supersonic plane can be 
profitable. 
  The three companies pointed our that, within a greater 
framework, in which U.S., Italian, Japanese, and Russian 
companies are included, they also participate in research for a 
second-generation supersonic passenger plane. The development 
costs for such a plane are estimated by experts at $12 to $15 
billion.

CONSUMER REPORT; 


TRAVEL IN 21ST CENTURY WILL BE DOWN A FAST TRACK 




Airplanes will fly five times the speed of sound and carry 300 to 400 
passengers, reaching destinations in minutes. Today it takes hours. 


Trains will run up to 300 m.p.h. and ride as smoothly as rolling on glass. 
Cruise ships will carry 5,000 passengers in tri-hulled vessels, with 12-story 
hotel towers amidships. 


A driving vacation will probably be mapped out on a screen mounted on the 
dashboard. If traffic thickens ahead, the screen will offer alternative routes. 


Science fiction? 


Not according to Montreal-based futurist Louis D'Amore, who spoke of what lies 
ahead in travel and transportation during a speech at Gov. George Duekmejian's 
recent annual tourism conference. D'Amore believes that some, or all, could 
come about in the not-too-distant future. 




Beyond Concorde 


Take that Mach 5 airliner, for instance. We have become accustomed to hearing 
about the Concorde, the first supersonic jet, which does better than Mach 1. 


But the Anglo-French Concorde is no longer in production, and, when the few 
that exist are retired in 10 to 15 years, there are no others to take their 
place. However, plans are to build a second generation of supersonic carriers. 


D'Amore said that West Germany is working on plans for a jet with a top speed 
of Mach 4.4. The Soviet Union is doing even better; it is planning to fly a 
liner at Mach 5 as early as 1999. 


D'Amore believes that there will be a transitional supersonic transport (SST) 
somewhere between the Concorde and the new super-fast aircraft . . . somewhere 
near Mach 3, about 2,000 m.p.h 


The United States also is building an SST. It is hoped that the jet will test 
fly in 1996. 




Unresolved Issues 


The trouble with SSTs in the earth's atmosphere, of course, is that the 
environmental issues (noise, air pollution, etc.) that prevented the Concorde 
from flying over U.S. land have yet to be addressed. SSTs are still a political 
hot potato. 


Also there's the cost, which could be prohibitive. 


Whatever the obstacles, enough plans have been laid for D'Amore to envision the 
inside cabins. 


Every seat in the U.S. version will have its own phone and TV console, offering 
programs in several languages. Passengers will play video games, run their own 
computer programs, send fax messages and make hotel and car-rental reservations 
electronically. 


If the public suddenly develops a thirst for supersonic transportation, target 
test dates might be brought forward. 




Ground Speed 


In addition, consider the trains. Again, we're looking at a new generation of 
equipment. 


The Japanese introduced its famed bullet train in 1964. It wasn't until 1981 
that France followed with its version, which has an average speed of 125 m.p.h. 
and has reached 165 m.p.h. 


By the early 1990s West Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium will have high-speed 
rail systems. Before the end of the century they will link most of Europe's 
major cities. 


Japan is studying a 300 m.p.h. rail engine. 


Pressure is mounting in the United States to develop a similar system. 
Advocates point out that trains are energy efficient, do the least damage to 
the environment and are the least expensive mode of public transportation. 




High-Speed Competition 


D'Amore reported that a dozen states have feasibility studies in the works, and 
that Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas are determined to be first in the 
high-speed train business. 


Los Angeles-Las Vegas is a possible route for a high-speed system. And Amtrak, 
the nation's rail company, believes the Los Angeles-San Diego run would be most 
promising for such a system. 


Cruise ships in the 21st Century will be at least 100,000 tons and carry 5,000 
passengers. Passengers will be whisked around by a rail system, presumably a 
little slower than 300 m.p.h. 


D'Amore said that building these new vehicles isn't the tough part. Finding 
room for them to maneuver is. 


D'Amore warned that congestion could be the major inhibitor of travel by the 
turn of the century. He said that shortages of adequate roads, airports and 
bridges -- what he called "our aging infrastructure" -- could negate the 
technological gains that promise to make travel in 2000 and beyond a new 
adventure.

eventually reach 300 m.p.h.

From this summer, British Airways will no longer offer the most frequent
service between London's Heathrow and New York's John F Kennedy airports.
Within a month, American Airlines is to increase its daily flights on the
route from four to six, overtaking BA's five. Of those BA flights, only
three are by standard aircraft; the others are Pounds 5,000-a-seat Concorde
trips.
And within two weeks of American's move, its great rival, United Airlines,
will increase its daily Heathrow-JFK flights from three to four.
Other significant carriers on the route are Virgin Atlantic, with a
twice-daily service, and Kuwait Airways and Air India, with one each.
That makes 19 flights a day between the two airports. Moreover, BA and
Virgin have daily flights to Newark airport, closer to Manhattan than JFK
but in the neighbouring state of New Jersey.
The elevation of the Heathrow-New York route to the status of business
shuttle is a result mainly of the economic recovery, say American and
United.
Frequency of service appeals to business travellers more than to tourists.
Business executives are more likely to fly on an airline that has a lot of
flights: if the meeting goes on an extra half hour, the executive knows
there will be another flight home soon.
For United, the decision to emphasise frequency of service, rather than size
of aircraft, has led them to employ one of the smallest aircraft available
for such a journey. 'The route consists largely of point-to-point traffic
and we decided that the best method was to use the smaller Boeing 767-200s,
flying more frequently,' according to a United spokesman.
United's early flight from London - at 0755 the first of the day to JFK - is
especially popular among business travellers, and has tempted American to
introduce its own early flight at 0830. The business traveller is an
extraordinarily lucrative customer to secure. The normal business class
return fare between London and New York is about Pounds 2,200, almost 10
times the cheapest Apex economy fare.
Because of the congestion at Heathrow, an airline cannot easily secure
additional take-off slots. American Airlines is, therefore, sacrificing
services to tourist-type destinations, such as Los Angeles and Miami, to
increase its Heathrow-JFK frequency.
American is, however, not increasing its daily flights from other European
cities such as Paris, Brussels, Zurich - where economic recovery is yet to
make itself strongly felt.
BA says it is unworried by the increasing competition on flights to JFK. It
still considers the route 'blue chip'. But BA says that, since it took a
stake in USAir, it has been keen to link transatlantic passengers with
USAir's huge domestic network. That means it is adding flights to large
USAir hub cities, such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Charlotte, and
Baltimore.
BA can also take some comfort from the fact that the rise in frequencies
does not mean quite as sharp an increase in the number of available seats.
BA flies the route with 380-seat Boeing 747s. Most of the US-owned aircraft,
on the other hand, are the smaller Boeing 767s, which carry only between
between 164 and 214 passengers, or McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, carrying 271
people. Moreover, passengers in a hurry are also likely to factor into their
choice the fact that the 767s take about 20 minutes longer than the MD-11s
and 747s.

Travellers' tales from eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union, of
overcrowded aircraft, of being flown to the wrong destination or of
passengers having to club together to buy the fuel, make good table talk.
But yesterday's fatal air crash in Russia is a reminder that safety, as well
as comfort, should be taken seriously when you venture east of the Elbe.
One way of increasing the safety of your trip - recommended by the UK
foreign office - is to seek out western airlines that fly to smaller cities
in the east.
Several European carriers are making a virtue of their central European
bases and are offering quick connections to destinations such as Bucharest
and Timisoara in Romania, Kiev and Odessa in Ukraine, Minsk in Belarus, Alma
Ata in Kazakhstan and half a dozen other hard-to-get-to cities.
Your first choice should be Austrian Airlines. It flies to 10 cities that do
not have direct links from London, Paris, New York or Tokyo, and it also
offers short, same-day connections. Travellers receive boarding passes at
their home airport for the onward flight and can check baggage through to
their final destination. Austrian guarantees baggage transfer at Vienna even
if there is only half an hour between connecting flights.
Although a direct flight might be faster, the extra time needed for the
stopover in Vienna is usually short, and the difference in comfort and
convenience great. Going to Kiev via Vienna, for example, you leave London
at 07:35 and arrive at 14:50. The connecting flight from Paris leaves at
08:10, from Milan at 09:20 and from New York at about 19:00 the previous
day.
The direct alternative from London, on Ukraine International Airlines, flies
three times a week in the late afternoon, arriving at the inconvenient hour
of 21:45.
Running a close second to Austrian Airlines is Lufthansa, the German
carrier. It flies to many of the same cities, but some departures are too
early for a same-day connection when starting from London, Paris or New
York.
However, Lufthansa does fly to some cities that no other western carrier
reaches. They include Alma Ata and Tashkent, the capitals of Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan, both important for the oil and gas industries.
Some oil executives are not so lucky. Cities such as Baku in Azerbaijan have
no direct flights from western Europe. But it is possible to avoid flying
via Moscow on THY, the Turkish airline. THY also flies to Ashkhabad, capital
of Turkmenistan, and if there is no same-day connection in Ankara, THY will
pay for a night's accommodation.
Travellers to the Baltic states have a wider choice. To Riga or Tallinn, you
can go via Frankfurt or Munich on Lufthansa, via Copenhagen on SAS, or
Helsinki on Finnair. For Vilnius, pick from SAS, Lufthansa, Austrian or
Hamburg Airlines.
Some of these connections do not appear in airline guides such as ABC. And
new destinations are continually being added: Austrian will fly to Odessa
from this spring, for example.
However, all connections and additions should be on electronic booking
systems.
But it may be wise to stimulate the imagination of your travel department or
agency to check all the options.

Against this the provision for BA to repay part of its operating surplus to
the government permitted even this to be offset by earlier operating losses,
and certain 'post-review capital expenditure'.
Unless it is seriously suggested that the taxpayer should again pay huge
sums of public money to subsidise supersonic flight in a new generation of
aircraft, nobody should be misled into making false judgments about
commercial viability based on Concorde experience.
Another omission from the article is the cost to other airlines of Concorde
being given priority passage through a 'stack' in which less privileged
aircraft are forced to keep their passengers waiting to land because
Concorde has such alarming fuel flows at low speed and altitude.
The prospect of greatly extending the nuisance, and very possibly structural
damage, caused by secondary shock waves from Concorde also needs to be faced
before any investment in further supersonic aircraft development takes
place.

   FRANKFURT, LONDON


Europe's three leading aerospace groups are to join forces in a feasibility
study for a supersonic passenger aircraft to succeed the Anglo-French
Concorde.
British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Germany's Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) hope that their study will lead to the production of an aircraft for
the second half of the next decade.
They will be seeking cash aid from national governments and from Brussels
for the project, which is estimated to cost the makers as much as Dollars
15bn (Pounds 10.20bn) for a maximum demand of 1,000 aircraft. One company
said the project, the European Supersonic Research Programme (ESRP), needed
Dollars 100m a year in initial investment.
Two of the three companies, BAe and Aerospatiale, designed and built the
existing Concorde. While that project was loss-making and abandoned with
only a handful built, the aircraft has proved a success story for British
Airways, which operates seven of the 100-seat aircraft.
The normal Concorde return fare between London and New York is more than
Pounds 5,000 and the airline takes more than Pounds 150m a year in ticket
revenues from its small fleet. Concorde is limited, however, to North
Atlantic routes because of its 3,720 miles range.
Since the aircraft's development in the 1970s, the growth of Asian economies
has created a market linking Europe and east Asia and across the Pacific,
which requires an aircraft with greater range.
The outline specification for the ESRP calls for an aircraft with a range of
6,200 miles, seats for 250 passengers and a speed of Mach 2, twice the speed
of sound.
BAe said that if the project went ahead, an aircraft could be flying by the
second half of the next decade.
'We want to keep Europe's lead in supersonic passenger aircraft,' the
company said.
The ESRP companies would share research costs equally in the project, which
would focus on materials, engines, systems and aerodynamics, according to
Dasa, the loss-making Daimler-Benz subsidiary that holds the German stake in
the European Airbus.
The three companies have been part of an international aircraft development
study group embracing US, Japanese, Italian and Russian companies, Dasa
said. But the trio has now decided to press ahead with its own design.
BAe said it spent less than Pounds 5m on pre-feasibility study research last
year. It has been in discussion with the UK Department of Trade and Industry
about assistance for the new project.
It said that research for the engine for a Concorde successor was 'a
parallel project' involving the UK company Rolls-Royce, one of the world's
three main manufacturers of commercial aero engines. Spin-offs from the
project could include technology for use in future subsonic passenger
aircraft, Dasa said.
