   Secretary of State James A. Baker III prepares
to call for a decisive hemispheric stand against Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega as foreign ministers from the Organization
of American States gather here today.
   A highlight of the meeting is expected to be the admission of
Canada as the 32nd OAS member, effective Jan. 1. There also is some
sentiment in support of readmitting Cuba.
   The OAS expelled the government of president Fidel Castro in
1962 on grounds that the country's Marxist-Leninist philosophy is
incompatible with OAS principles.
   OAS foreign ministers usually convene only once a year, but the
Panama crisis has prompted four special OAS sessions since May. An
OAS commission appointed in May was unable to fulfill its mandate
of arranging a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   U.S. officials said Baker was expected to deliver a tough speech
condemning the Panamanian government, but it was not clear whether
he would make specific proposals.
   The inaugural session was scheduled for this morning, and
Baker's remarks were to be delivered in late afternoon.
   The Panama crisis arose six months ago when Panamanian
authorities threw out the returns from national elections amid
widespread allegations of fraud. A Noriega crony, Francisco
Rodriguez, was sworn in Sept. 1 as the unelected president.
   The United States has been the strongest proponent of decisive
action against Noriega, but other OAS countries maintain that the
group should stay out of what is an essentially internal Panamanian
matter.
   Also on the OAS agenda is Nicaragua's scheduled Feb. 25
presidential election. The meeting is expected to produce numerous
calls for a free and fair election process.
   Cuba has been sharply critical of the OAS over the years,
looking on the organization as an instrument of U.S. foreign
policy. But seven leading Latin American democracies called last
month for Cuba's readmission to the OAS and Cuba has said it's
ready to accept.
   Cuba has far more diplomatic support in the hemisphere than at
any time since it was expelled from the OAS 27 years ago.
   The United States has lobbied hard against Cuba's readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central American and
reported human rights abuses.
   Cuba's readmission would require a two-thirds vote of member
nations in attendance.

   Broke, demoralized and ignored, the
Organization of American States needed a spirit-nourishing issue.
Manuel Antonio Noriega may have provided it.
   The OAS has been unable to accomplish much of anything this
decade. One of the organization's principal aims is to keep the
peace, but it has been on the periphery of the continuing bloodshed
in Central America and was irrelevant at the time of the
British-Argentine war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands and the
U.S.-led invasion of Grenada a year later.
   At one point several years ago, an OAS official said the
organization was so feckless that it was unable to agree on a
resolution commemorating the upcoming 500th anniversary of the
discovery of America.
   But for the OAS, Noriega has been heaven-sent. The organization,
which seemed paralyzed by factionalism, was able to close ranks
against the Panamanian leader Wednesday night.
   With only Panama and Nicaragua dissenting, OAS foreign ministers
agreed to blame Noriega for ``the grave events and abuses'' that
have occurred since the May 7 national elections in Panama.
   International organizations normally are loathe to single out
leaders of member states for criticism but the scenes of opposition
candidates and ordinary citizens being bludgeoned by government
agents turned stomachs from one end of the hemisphere to the other.
It was time for the OAS to drop its genteel guard.
   The foreign ministers approved a resolution which not only held
Noriega personally responsible for the bloodshed, but also
appointed a mediating team to take steps aimed at ensuring a
``transfer of power'' in Panama.
   That is quite a departure for an organization which normally has
as its highest principle the right of member states to be spared
outside intervention.
   Noriega, of course, will put his own spin on the resolution. He
is expected to tell the mediators that he is a soldier for
democracy who wanted nothing more than to see a ``transfer of
power'' resulting from the May 7 elections. On that basis,
Noriega's foreign minister was able to go along with the resolution
Wednesday night.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has shown interest in
reviving the OAS. He is planning to appoint one of the State
Department's most accomplished Latin American hands, Luigi Einaudi,
as U.S. ambassador to the OAS.
   But Baker didn't take office soon enough to head off the layoffs
earlier this year of 300 OAS employees, about 30 percent of the
total. That step was largely brought on by U.S. arrearages
amounting to more than $50 million. More layoffs are expected next
month.
   The OAS heyday was the 1960s. It was the Cold War era and U.S.
administrations were able to forge an anti-communist consensus with
rightist dictators and hawkish democratic governments which
dominated the hemisphere at the time.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro was everybody's villain. The OAS
expelled him from its ranks a few years after his revolution and,
25 summers ago, the organization slapped a mandatory economic and
diplomatic embargo against Cuba.
   In 1965, the United States invaded the Dominican Republic, a
seeming violation of the OAS charter. But OAS nations, albeit
reluctantly, gave their blessing to the U.S. action rather than
siding with the target of the invasion.
   With the demise of rightist dictatorships in Latin America and
their replacement by elected governments, the anti-communist
consensus in the hemisphere has unraveled.
   Never has Latin America been more democratic or less willing to
go along with Washington's policies. Support for President Reagan's
Central America policies in the hemisphere was virtually invisible.
   The special session on Noriega recalled the time 10 years when
the OAS decided to move against Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza. A month after the OAS foreign ministers called for Somoza's
resignation, he fled to Paraguay.
   Now the question is whether the OAS stand against Noriega will
contribute to a similar result.
   One of the OAS mediators who will sit down with Noriega next
week is Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, the principal
architect of the agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan starting a year ago.
   If Cordovez was able to get more than 100,000 Russian troops
out, surely he can do the same with one Panamanian. Or can he?

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers assembled here today for a historic debate on the Panama
crisis, with the United States prepared to ask for a resolution
demanding that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega step aside.
   President Bush's Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House was ``confident there will be general hemispheric
condemnation of Noriega's actions'' at the session.
   ``We hope and expect the OAS will take a strong stand on Panama
and against the Noriega regime,'' Fitzwater said, adding the United
States would let other countries ``take the lead'' in proposing
specific motions. He said Secretary of State James A Baker III
would ``speak up forcefully regarding our views.''
   In Panama, opponents to Noriega called for a one-day general
strike today to protest the voided elections and the beating by the
general's supporters of political opposition leaders. But many
factories, stores and street stands were open, although commuter
traffic was lighter than normal.
   As the delegates prepared for their opening session, the United
States was emerging as perhaps the most militant of the 31 nations
represented here for the first special OAS foreign ministers
meeting in seven years.
   U.S. officials said Tuesday the Bush administration was ready to
ask the OAS to demand that Noriega step down following an election
10 days ago that the State Department claimed was rigged initially
and then voided when the fraud could not be concealed.
   But the preliminary signs for the administration were not
encouraging because two of the countries thought to be most
sympathetic to the U.S. view, Venezuela and Peru, were proposing
resolutions that fell far short of U.S. objectives.
   Neither mentions Noriega by name nor recommends that he step
down.
   At his daily White House briefing for reporters, Fitzwater said
the administration was not seeking a country where Noriega could
find exile.
   ``There have been a number of countries that have said they
would accept Gen. Noriega,'' he added. ``At least some of them are
countries that don't have extradition treaties with the United
States.''
   The OAS session evoked memories of one 10 years ago when OAS
foreign ministers, including then-U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, demanded the resignation of Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza. He fled less than a month later.
   This year, the delegates seem somewhat reluctant to interfere in
Panama's internal affairs to the degree that they did a decade ago
in Nicaragua.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the May 7 electoral returns in Panama while asserting that the
solution to Panama's crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A U.S. official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the OAS secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in Panama.
   While Bush administration officials consider both drafts to be
tepid, the decision to raise the events surrounding the Panamanian
election to the highest hemispheric tribunal is seen as a plus for
U.S. policy.
   The United States has been attempting to topple Noriega for more
than a year, a policy that Panamanian delegates at today's meeting
are expected to seize on.
   Based on official statements in recent days, Panama was
preparing to accuse the United States at today's meeting of
systematic violation of Panamanian sovereignty in violation of the
OAS charter.
   As examples, Panama was intent on highlighting U.S. economic
sanctions imposed 14 months ago and the reported $10 million U.S.
government donation to opposition forces in Panama during the
election campaign.
   Venezuela requested the meeting after international observers
contended that the May 7 election was marked by massive fraud
committed by the pro-Noriega coalition.
   Subsequently, the results were tossed out after a bloody
confrontation between armed supporters of Noriega and opposition
demonstrators, including presidential candidate Guillermo Endara
and a vice presidential running mate, Guillermo Ford.
   Scenes of the bloodshed were widely disseminated outside Panama
and had a major impact on hemispheric public opinion.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the OAS charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in Panama.
   Indicating that the United States plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, Boucher said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interest
in democracy.''

   In a diplomatic compromise accepted by both
the United States and Panama, the Organization of American States
called for a transfer of power through democratic means in Panama
while leaving the details to a team of mediators.
   The plan was unanimously authorized late Wednesday by OAS
foreign ministers in a resolution that condemns the ``grave events
and abuses'' by Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but
which also stops short of criticizing his government.
   The resolution, approved in an unusually efficient manner by the
29 delegates present, was sufficiently ambiguous to win the
approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session: Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge
Ritter.
   Baker pronounced himself ``very pleased'' with the outcome.
Ritter said, ``I feel fully satisfied.''
   President Bush, responding to a question shouted by a reporter
as he headed from the Oval Office to a helicopter this morning,
called the OAS action a ``good resolution.'' Bush left for a
four-day trip to New York, Boston and Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The president's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, later told
journalists on Air Force One that the resolution ``constitutes a
condemnation of Noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral
process.'' He added: ``We're gratified that the OAS countries
shared the United States' position.''
   The key provision empowers the foreign ministers of Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad to try to promote a ``national accord,
within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest period possible,
to ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of Panamanian people.''
   OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares was asked to assist the
delegation that will travel to the Central American nation. The
organization issued a statement this afternoon saying the envoys
will depart Monday. They were asked to report back by June 5, and
the resolution said unspecified ``subsequent measures'' may be
needed after June 5.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, speaking today from
Caracas on ``CBS This Morning,'' called the OAS meeting ``the
inauguration of new relations between the United States and the
rest of the hemisphere because we have all agreed on a declaration
defending democracy for Latin America and we have all condemned the
abuses commited in Panama....''
   Noriega is expected to tell the envoys that he never has opposed
the fundamental purpose of the resolution _ a transfer of power
through democratic means. He is likely to claim the May 7
presidential elections, which he later ordered voided, were
designed to achieve that very goal.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to Noriega was appropriate.
   The initial draft of the resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted any reference to Noriega but the United States
and other countries strongly opposed to Noriega reversed that
omission during a closed session of more than two hours, paving the
way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
Noriega ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in Panama.
   The decision to include the reference to Noriega was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording while the
abstainers were from Peru, Uruguay and five Caribbean countries.
   The Nicaraguan delegate failed in two efforts to win approval of
amendments assailing President Bush's decision last week to send
2,000 more U.S. troops to Panama. Bush's stated purpose was to
protect American lives.
   Ritter expressed satisfaction with the final resolution, saying
it fell far short of the U.S. demand for a condemnation of the
Panamanian government. He promised that the OAS delegation would be
welcomed by Panamanian authorities.
   Noriega's critics have maintained he first tried to rig the
outcome of the May 7 election in support of his candidate, Carlos
Duque, then ordered the returns voided when he could no longer
conceal the fraud. Government agents severely beat at least two
opposition candidates, a point noted in the resolution.
   Sen. Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who went to Panama as
an observer for the election, attended the meeting at OAS
headquarters and termed the final resolution ``very positive'' but
said he would have preferred an explicit demand that Noriega step
down.
   The resolution marks a return to a key diplomatic assignment for
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, a member of the
mediating team. Cordovez was the principal negotiator for the
agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Afghanistan.
   In contrast to other OAS foreign ministers meetings, this one
was short on rhetoric and stressed substantive give-and-take.
   Baena Soares had predicted Wednesday morning the session could
drag on until Friday but the resolution was in its final form and
approved by consensus at 11:50 p.m., barely six hours after the
formal proceeding had got under way.

   U.S. officials have virtually given up hope
that Organization of American States mediators will be able to
succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in Panama, but
Secretary of State James A. Baker III remained publicly optimistic
today.
   One official dismissed the mediation as a ``corpse'' and said
alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to step down.
   Three OAS mediators, aided by Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares, have made two visits to Panama over the past month to
attempt to seek a solution to the country's political crisis.
   On their last visit, the mediators left some ideas with the two
most powerful political blocs in Panama and with the Defense Forces
on how to promote a dialogue.
   Baena Soares is ``neither optimistic nor pessimistic'' about the
prospects for success but believes the progress achieved to date has
been satisfactory, according to an aide.
   But a U.S. official criticized the effort, saying ``the OAS has
fallen on its face on this.''
   The official, asking not to be identified, said U.S. diplomats
from around the hemisphere have been trying to enlist governments
from Latin America and the Caribbean to support the U.S. position.
   Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee this
morning, Baker said today he remains ``very hopeful'' that the OAS
mediators will be successful.
   He reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. view that there can be no
normalization of relations with Panama so long as Noriega remains in
power.
   The United States has been attempting to force Noriega out of
office since he was indicted by two Florida grand juries on drug
smuggling charges in February 1988.
   But few, if any, governments in the hemisphere are as
unswervingly opposed to Noriega as the United States. Many are
reluctant to intervene in Panama's internal affairs, while others
see the issue as a U.S.-Panamanian problem that should be dealt with
as such, the officials said.
   The official State Department position is that the mediation
effort should not be judged until July 19, the deadline for the
mediators to submit a report on their activities to OAS foreign
ministers.
   The administration believes the only acceptable solution is for
Noriega to agree to step down as Defense Force commander before the
deadline. Privately, officials say there is no sign that will occur.
   The crisis arose last month when Panama's electoral tribunal,
dominated by Noriega's allies, tossed out the returns from the May 7
presidential elections. Independent observers said the opposition
slate had won by a landslide.
   There was indignation throughout the hemisphere when, three days
after the election, opposition candidates were beaten by government
security agents. A week later, the OAS mediating team was set up.
OAS foreign ministers blamed Noriega for the ``grave events and
abuses'' in Panama.
   But much of the anti-Noriega sentiment has dissipated over the
past six weeks, generating pessimism here that the mediators will be
able to fulfill their mandate.
   The officials said the administration is weighing a series of
options for bringing additional pressure to bear on Noriega,
including the seizure of his overseas assets, believed to number in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.

   Three Latin American foreign ministers,
fulfilling a mandate from the Organization of American States,
headed to Panama today to promote a democratic transfer of power.
   Panamanian authorities have promised to cooperate with the
mediators but Bush administration officials said initial comments
by Panamanian authorities have not been encouraging.
   A pro-government party in Panama said Monday it wants the OAS to
focus on U.S. ``aggression'' against Panama.
   The foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Sahadeo Basdeo,
arrived Monday night and said the delegation is ``not here to
interfere with the internal affairs of Panama. We came as friends
and neighbors.''
   The other two, from Ecuador and Guatemala, were to fly
separately to Panama and planned to join OAS Secretary General Joao
Baena Soares of Brazil.
   OAS foreign ministers last week blamed Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega for ``the grave events and abuses'' in Panama following the
failed election process in that country earlier this month.
   After a vote count that international observers said was marred
by massive fraud, Panama's electoral tribunal threw out the
results. The Bush administration has maintained that the opposition
slate, based on an independent count, won the election by a 3-1
margin.
   Opposition candidates subsequently were beaten and bloodied by
Noriega supporters during a post-election demonstration.
   The United States claims that Noriega has disrupted
constitutional processes on two occasions in 15 months. The first
was the ouster of then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February
1988 and the second was what the administration says was the theft
and subsequent annulment of the May 7 election.
   In addition to Baena Soares, the delegation is made up of the
foreign minister of Ecuador, Diego Cordovez; of Trinidad, Sahadeo
Basdeo; and of Guatemala, Mario Palencia.
   The OAS resolution calls for the mediators to ``secure a
national accord, within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest
time possible, to ensure the transfer of power with full respect
for the sovereign will of the Panamanian people.''
   The tentative plan is for the ministers to report back to their
OAS colleagues on June 6. If Panamanian authorities show no
interest in complying with the spirit of the OAS resolution, the
Bush administration is expected to support an escalation of OAS
pressure against Noriega.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said Monday that
Noriega has raised the possibility of resolving the crisis by
inviting opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara to join
a three-member junta. The other members would be Noriega allies.
   ``Noriega is proposing one of you and two of us,'' said the
official, suggesting that any such proposal would not be acceptable
to OAS ministers.
   The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition of
their victory claim in the election, shook hands and passed out
leaflets in Panama Monday welcoming the OAS delegation.
   ``The OAS will not solve all our problems, but it will create
the environment. They have come to investigate,'' said Endara.
   A pro-government party Monday criticized the OAS for condemning
Noriega and said its delegation could not mediate among Panamanians.
   ``We call on the OAS to adopt a virile attitude toward
aggression against our people by the United States,'' said a
statement issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party, the largest
pro-government group.
   Noriega and his allies have consistently maintained that
Panama's problems stem from a systematic U.S. effort to subvert the
country's democratic process, citing accounts of a $10 million CIA
contribution to the opposition coalition.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Jun (PL) -- The 24th OAS General 
Assembly continued today receiving new requests urging the 
readmittance of Cuba into the OAS, from which it was removed in 
1962 due to its political disagreement with the United States. 
  During the second day of talks in Belem, Para State, 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim reintroduced the topic 
of Cuba's readmittance before the OAS meeting and reiterated the 
need for "reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric 
community." 
  During the inauguration of the 24th OAS Assembly on Monday, 
outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares as well as 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco recommended that Cuba's 
readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of 
the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude 
Friday. 
  In his speech to the foreign ministers and representatives 
of 
the 34 OAS-member countries, Amorim recalled that his country 
"maintains friendly relations and has significant cultural links 
with Cuba." 
  "Despite everything, we do not believe that economic and 
political isolation is the best way to contribute to a 
transition that is already in the making in that country," 
Amorim added. 
  Baena Soares, who will conclude almost a decade as head of 
the OAS on 20 June, made similar statements yesterday. 
  "As everyone knows, I have been inquiring whether this is 
the 
right moment for OAS members to review the measure adopted over 
30 years ago when the Cuban Government was suspended ... the 
90's are not the 60's," he stated. 
  According to diplomatic sources, this was the first time the 
outgoing OAS head has dealt with this topic officially before a 
regular OAS General Assembly. 
  "Cuba's removal is not in keeping with the political 
revolution the world has faced in the past years," he added. 
  Meanwhile, President Franco supports that Cuba be readmitted 
and the OAS reassess its position regarding Cuba. "Brazil 
favors a harmonious dialogue among all nations, without 
exceptions," he added. 
  In statements to the media in Belem, Bolivian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar expressed his support for Cuba's 
readmittance into the OAS while his Costa Rican counterpart 
Fernando Naranjo proposed that the OAS establish channels of 
communication with the Cuban Government.

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- OAS Assistant Secretary 
General Christopher Thomas stated here today that so far none of 
the 34 OAS member countries have formally proposed Cuba's 
readmission into the organization. 
  Thomas, who represents Trinidad and Tobago, said OAS 
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares had proposed that Cuba's 
return to the OAS be discussed. He noted, however, that so far 
no country has made a formal request to this effect. 
  In accordance with OAS regulations, Thomas said, the 
readmission of a member country into the organization must first 
be formally proposed by one member country, and then consulted 
with the other members attending the General Assembly. 
  Thomas is actively participating in the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, which opened on 6 June in the Amazon city of Belem, in 
northern Brazil. He said: "As Baena Soares said, circumstances 
today are conducive to reexamining Cuba's readmission to the 
OAS, but so far I am unaware of any country having made such a 
proposal." 
  As assistant secretary general, Thomas will replace Baena 
Soares -- whose term expires this month, after having served 10 
years in office -- during the two-month period preceding the 
installation of the new secretary general-elect, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Although some Latin American foreign ministers have timidly 
defended Baena Soares's proposal that the OAS member countries 
discuss the possibility of readmitting Cuba, only Argentina has 
formally stated its position on the issue; that is, its 
opposition to the proposal. 
  During a news conference Argentine OAS Ambassador Hernan 
Patino Meyer said flatly: "The OAS consists of democratic 
states, and as soon as Cuba takes steps toward its 
democratization it will be possible to readmit it into the 
organization." 
  Asked why Argentina and Brazil had, then, continued as OAS 
member states under the military regimes, Patino Meyer said that 
at that time the 1992 clause that provides for the separation 
from the OAS of nondemocratic states had not yet been approved. 
"Had I been the OAS secretary general at that time, I would 
have expelled Argentina and Brazil from the organization," 
Patino Mayer said. 
  In his opening speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly, 
Baena 
Soares said: "I have been asking for some time whether it is 
the right moment for the member countries to reexamine the 
decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the Cuban 
Government from OAS activities. The nineties are different from 
the sixties." 
  Baena Soares' proposal was not immediately discussed by the 
OAS foreign ministers because they were more interested in 
discussing the Haitian crisis. 
  Although President Itamar Franco did not discuss the Cuban 
issue in his speech at the OAS Assembly, he stated shortly 
before returning to Brasilia that "the OAS must look at the 
Cuban position." 
  Cuba was separated from the OAS in 1962, three years after 
the victory of the Cuban Revolution led by President Fidel 
Castro.

   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma
met with military strongman Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega Monday after
he conferred with an OAS mission trying to mediate Panama's election
deadlock.
   On its second trip to Panama, the Organization of American States
mission met separately Monday with Solis Palma and opposition party
members.
   Immediatedly after his one-hour meeting with OAS officials Solis
Palma met for another hour with Noriega. The general was seen
entering the governmental palace in civilian clothing with Carlos
Duque, the government's candidate in the May election that was
annulled.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter told reporters later
that Panamanian officials and the OAS representatives were trying to
find ``an acceptable formula'' for a dialogue between the government
and opposition.
   ``This mechanism even though it obviously doesn't exist yet .. .
this is what we are searching for,'' Ritter said.
   Noriega did not speak with reporters.
   One OAS delegate, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez,
said earlier he is confident the government and opposition have the
political will to settle their differences.
   He said it is up to the Panamanians to resolve the dispute.
   The OAS only can ``promote a dialogue and perhaps give ideas
based on our national experience based on similar situation,'' he
said.
   Joao Baena Soares, the OAS secretary-general, and the foreign
ministers of Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago are the other members
of the mission.
   Panama's political crisis began with the May 7 election, which
international observers said the opposition won by at least a 2-1
margin. The government controlled by Noriega annulled the election
and opposition candidates were attacked and beaten by his supporters.
   The OAS then agreed to send the mission to negotiate a national
dialogue on the transfer of power on Sept. 1, as required by the
constitution.
   On their first visit to Panama at the end of May, the OAS
diplomats could not persuade the opposition and government to hold
direct talks. Opposition leaders said they would talk only with
Noriega, and he refused.
   Cordovez, a former U.N. official who negotiated the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, was optimistic Monday.
   ``I think there is a political will in the government and the
opposition that has to be translated into specific steps,'' he said.
``It seems to me that it is most urgent to establish mechanisms that
allow Panamanians to talk and negotiate.''
   Noriega and government officials blame Panama's problems on the
United States, which they say wants to renege on 1977 treaties that
turn over the Panama Canal to Panama at the end of the century.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges last year in the United States. He denies
the charges and has refused U.S. demands he resign.

   Foreign Ministers of the Organization of
American States approved a resolution Wednesday night to send
mediators to Panama in an effort to end that country's political
crisis through a ``transfer of power.''
   The resolution also held Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega responsible for the ``grave events and abuses'' in Panama
in recent days.
   The mediators were ordered to report back by June 5 on their
mission in order to determine whether any subsequent measures are
appropriate to resolve Panama's crisis.
   The resolution asked the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala
and Trinidad, assisted by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares,
to undertake the mission in order to secure a ``national accord''
in Panama within ``democratic mechanisms.''
   The accord is to be reached in the ``shortest period possible to
ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people,'' the resolution said.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to Noriega was appropriate.
   The initial draft resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted all references to Noriega, but the United
States and other countries strongly opposed to Noriega reversed
that omission during a closed session of more than two hours,
paving the way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
Noriega ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in Panama.
   The decision to include the reference to Noriega was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter, after
opposing the any change in the initial resolution, said he was
pleased with the overall result. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III also said he was pleased.
   The delegates reassembled in public session after their private
meeting late Wednesday to give the resolution final approval, but
that was considered a mere formality.
   The resolution was seen as a compromise between OAS factions
which had been advocating markedly different approaches to the
Panamanian crisis. One faction had advocated a hands-off policy
toward Noriega, citing OAS principles of non-intervention, and a
hard-line faction which had demanded the removal of Noriega from
power. The United States was in the latter category.
   Critics of the resolution argued that the call for a transfer of
power is largely meaningless because Noriega himself backed the
country's recent election process.
   But backers of the draft pointed out that the proposal calls for
an end to the crisis through democratic procedures.
   Noriega's candidate in the May 7 election, Carlos Duque, claimed
victory, but the results subsequently were voided by the Panamanian
Electoral Tribunal after widespread allegations of vote-rigging.
There also were brutal attacks by government agents on several of
the candidates in the election, a point noted in the draft
resolution.
   Noriega sees himself as no more than the Defense Force commander
who serves at the pleasure of a president who is the product of a
constitutional process. The first test of the resolution is whether
Noriega demonstrates a willingness to cooperate with the mediators.
   The proposal was presented by the delegations of Bolivia,
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Jamaica, Peru, Dominican
Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
   At the Capitol, 57 members of the Senate encouraged Baker, in a
letter, to press hard for OAS action.
   ``We urge the members of the OAS to pass a resolution calling
for the immediate replacement of the Noriega regime and
installation of a democratic government in Panama which reflects
the free will of the people of that country.'' the letter said.
   Ritter argued in closed session that Panama's problems are the
product of a systematic campaign of U.S. interventionism, including
a series of economic sanctions and what he says was a $10 million
U.S. government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   As the meeting started, the United States was aligned with the
Central American countries and some Caribbean islands in calling
for a strong stand against Noriega.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Mexico and Brazil were
believed to be encouraging a more cautious approach, one that takes
into account OAS principles requiring respect for the sovereignty
of member nations.

<HEAD>Panama Presents Its Case to the OAS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A candidate in the presidential
election said he told of massive fraud by both pro- and
anti-government parties today during a meeting with a delegation
from the Organization of American States.
   The Panamanian government presented its case against the United
States during a meeting Tuesday with the OAS delegation, sent in
the wake of the nullified election.
   ``The Panamanian government took the opportunity to present a
series of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate the
elections of 1989,'' presidential spokesman Jose Hernandez said.
   An OAS source who refused to be named said the meeting was
``difficult,'' but he did not go into detail.
   Sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meeting
with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and de
facto ruler of Panama.
   Members of the OAS delegation said they had come to facilitate a
search for solutions to Panama's political troubles.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and his two
vice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the OAS
delegation. They contend they won the May 7 vote by about 3-to-1
over Noriega's hand-picked candidate.
   The government, however, nullified the vote, and blamed
opposition fraud and U.S. interference in the election.
   The OAS group met this morning with Hildebrando Nicosia, the
Authentic Panamanian Party's presidential candidate. He received
only a small percentage of the vote.
   Nicosia said he described ``massive fraud committed by both
sides.'' He added, ``People are tired of instransigence on both
sides. The solution is for negotiations without prior conditions.''
   The OAS approved a resolution last week criticizing Noriega and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
It sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago as well as OAS
Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares.
   Acting president Manuel Solis Palma's government said it hoped
the mission would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict
between Panama and the United States,'' and it cited U.S. sanctions
as proof of malice.
   The government has proclaimed it will accept no interference in
internal Panamanian affairs and said some aspects of the OAS
resolution violate the OAS charter.
   Panama ``expounded its points of view about the events that
began 24 months ago,'' said Hernandez in a statement after Solis
Palma and members of his cabinet met with the OAS delegation.
   The first street demonstrations against Noriega's rule began in
June of 1987. Since then, Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drug
charges, charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to renege on its
commitment to give up the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.
   Members of the OAS delegation made no comment on the meeting
except for Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, who said
only, ``We have formed no impression.''
   At the airport after arriving Tuesday, Cordovez had said the
idea was to assist Panamanians in finding their own solutions and
to convey Latin American concern about the situation.
   Meanwhile, U.S. troops staged an amphibious landing exercise and
U.S. officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatched
over Panamanian roads with instructions not to stop.
   Several times in the past Panamanian police have stopped U.S.
convoys, which they have no right to do, U.S. officials said.

   Panama's foreign minister said top
officials held a ``positive, amicable'' meeting Tuesday with a
Latin American mission to reconcile the military-controlled
government and the opposition.
   The delegation from the Organization of American States arrived
earlier to mixed reactions and took a conciliatory tone.
   ``We are going to try to facilitate dialogue among Panamanians.
This is a situation that only Panamanians can resolve,'' said
Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, one of four OAS
delegates.
   They are investigating charges that Panama's de facto ruler,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, nullified national elections to
prevent an opposition victory.
   In Washington, defense officials said the United States was
sending armed military convoys on trips across Panama to ``flex our
muscles'' and draw a line against Panamanian harassment.
   Two convoys of 10 or so vehicles carrying armed soldiers have
crossed without incident in either directions under escort by
Panamanian soldiers, as provided in the canal treaties, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Rafael Vargas Santos, ambassador to Haiti, said in
Port-au-Prince the government would destroy the Panama Canal in the
event of a U.S. invasion.
   ``We will not be taken by surprise because we are already
prepared,'' he said on Radio Haiti Inter. ``The first thing we will
do is blow up the canal.''
   Cordovez, OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares and foreign
ministers Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad and Mario Palencia of
Guatemala met with acting president Manuel Solis Palma and several
Cabinet members for two hours but issued no statement.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said he could not say
what was discussed but said the meeting was ``positive, amicable.
... I think it was a very cordial, wide-ranging and positive
climate.''
   The group will meet with other ``political figures'' over the
next 10 days, Baena Soares said. No plans for a meeting with
Noriega were mentioned.
   Opposition leaders, who want their May 7 presidential election
victory recognized, had welcomed the delegation and said the
Pan-American organization ``has understood the urgent need to act.''
   But the government proclaimed earlier it would not accept any
interference in Panama's internal affairs. Government-controlled
media accused the organization of prejudging the case.
   ``They'll come, they won't see _ and they'll leave,'' said a
headline in Matutino newspaper.
   The OAS last week denounced Noriega and called for a swift
transfer of power.
   Solis Palma's government issued a proclamation Monday night
saying parts of the organization's resolution violate its charter,
including the ``ill-willed'' mention of Noriega.
   The government proclamation, however, welcomed the mission and
said it hoped it would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a
conflict between Panama and the United States.'' It cited U.S.
sanctions against Panama as proof of malice.
   Tuesday newspapers accused the organization of being led by the
United States, but Cordovez described its resolution as ``a Latin
American effort based on principles that we all respect _ the
principle of non-intervention.''
   In his arrival statement, Cordovez said Latin Americans are
concerned about Panama and the mission is a ``gesture of good will,
a gesture of friendship and solidarity that should not be
misinterpreted.''
   The opposition has called for a demonstration at noon Wednesday
in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations that lasts until
June 5, when the Organization of American States mission is to file
its report.
   Noriega, who commands Panama's Defense Forces, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges in the United States in February 1988. He
denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S. plot to renege
on its commitment to hand over the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.

   The government and opposition
appeared no closer to resolving the presidential election crisis
after a visit by representatives of the Organization of American
States.
   The opposition said Friday that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Panama's de facto ruler, must be a party to any negotiations.
Noriega, however, insisted the opposition must negotiate with
pro-government parties.
   The OAS mission, scheduled to leave today, had hoped to help
resolve an impasse that arose when the government nullified the May
7 presidential elections. International observers said the
opposition won by a 3-1 margin.
   ``At this time what we hoped for has not been achieved, an
agreement among Panamanians to resolve the crisis that bedevils
Panama,'' opposition candidate Guillermo Endara said Friday after
meeting with the OAS delegation.
   A member of the OAS delegation, Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez
of Ecuador, said the opposition and government ``understand each
other better, but it will require an enormous effort from the
Panamanian people because they have to develop the formulas to
solve the problem.''
   The other members of the mission were the foreign ministers of
Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, and OAS Secretary General Joao
Baena Soares of Brazil. The delegation must file a report the day
before the OAS foreign ministers meet on June 6 to consider the
organization's next step.
   Endara said he would not accept the presidency on Sept. 1, even
if Noriega allowed it but remained commander of the Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   ``I would just be a puppet,'' Endara said.
   The opposition has said repeatedly that Noriega and the Defense
Forces hold real power in Panama and therefore must be a part of
any talks.
   Noriega, at a news conference after his own meeting with the OAS
delegation, said: ``The key to the problem lies with the contending
political parties ... If the opposition remains intransigent, the
Defense Forces are not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be
drawn into the dispute.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' he said. ``They both
claim they won.''
   He said questions about the possibility of his own resignation
were ``stupid.''
   Noriega, who was indicted in February 1988 on drug charges in
the United States, said he told the OAS that Panama's problems were
caused by ``interfering hands.''
   He cited the drug charges, which he denies, and economic
sanctions as proof that the United States was plotting to keep the
Panama Canal despite treaties that call for the canal to be turned
over at the end of 1999.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III accused
the Soviet Union on Monday of supporting ``violence, destruction
and war'' in Central America and he said these activities are the
biggest obstacle to genuine superpower accommodation.
   In a speech to foreign ministers of the Organization of American
States, Baker also said the United States will never accommodate
itself to the ``outlaw regime'' in Panama and he called for the
international community to isolate that country.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Leonardo Kam responded immediately,
calling U.S. policies toward his country ``fascist.''
   Baker's remarks on the Soviet Union reinforced the notion that
Central America may be the most divisive issue when President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev have their Mediterranean
summit in three weeks.
   ``The Soviet Union bears a special responsibility because its
arms and money, moving through Cuba and Nicaragua, continue to
support violence, destruction and war,'' Baker said.
   He said shipments of Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in El
Salvador are incompatible with the ``new thinking'' in Moscow _ the
term Gorbachev uses to describe his break with past policy.
   ``Soviet behavior toward Cuba and Central America remains the
biggest obstacle to a full across-the-board improvement with the
United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Baker said the United States would be pleased to have normal
relations with a democratic Panama. But, he said, ``there is a
dictator, and his name is (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega.'' He added
that after the release Monday of an OAS report critical of Panama,
no ``self respecting democracy'' should make an accommodation with
that country.
   After Baker's remarks, Kam said the U.S. diplomat was resorting
``to a very old formula _ a fascist one _ of repeating time and
again false words so that they could ring true.'' He said Panama
was a victim of ``relentless U.S. aggression.''
   Until Baker spoke, the mood at the meeting was upbeat, with
speaker after speaker hailing the entry of Canada as the 32nd
member of the OAS. About 25 foreign ministers were on hand for the
opening day deliberations.
   Costa Rica introduced a resolution calling on all OAS member
states to withraw their ambassadors from Panama until a process is
under way there to restore democracy.
   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an OAS agency,
said in its report on Panama that the Panamanian government
routinely violates the rights of its citizens to, among other
things, life, humane treatment, personal liberty and judicial
guarantees.
   The commission called on Panama to take ``immediate steps to
control the excessive violence that the Defense Force police and
paramilitary groups employ against the civilian population.''
   These forces, the report said, must end the ``mistreatment,
torture and other cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment that
the Defense Forces inflict upon individuals deprived of their
freedom.''
   An OAS effort to try to arrange a democratic transfer of power
in Panama was suspended in late August after it became apparent
that Noriega was not interested in surrendering power.
   A separate OAS report on Nicaragua demands the release of all
political prisoners and says that there are no guarantees the Feb.
25 national elections there will be free and fair because of
built-in advantages enjoyed by the incumbent Sandinistas.
   The renewed fighting in El Salvador prompted Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto to introduce a resolution calling on the
OAS to make an urgent appeal to the government of El Salvador ``to
cease immediately the bombing of the civilian population.''
   Shortly before the afternoon session was convened, a delegation
of Sandinista and Nicaraguan Contra officials met at an OAS annex
several blocks away. The talks are a continuation of discussions
begun last Thursday at the United Nations.
   The objective is to reach agreement restoring the cease fire and
to lay the groundwork for the demobilization of the Contras.
   A number of OAS countries have expressed support for the
readmission of Cuba to the OAS after a 27-year absence.
   Cuba has said it is ready to accept an OAS invitation but
diplomats said that issue was not likely to come up at this year's
meeting.
   The United States has lobbied hard against Cuba's readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central America and
reported human rights abuses.

restore democratic rule in Panama.
   A declaration approved by the ministers Thursday was a
masterpiece of diplomatic evenhandedness, earning the support of
both the U.S. delegate and Noriega's representative.
   Specifically, the declaration said the proposed transfer of
power on Sept. 1 and subsequent free elections are to be carried
out through ``democratic means and in conformity with existing
internal Panamanian procedures.''
   The declaration lacks an enforcement mechanism and does not
specifically ask for Noriega to step down. Advocates of a stronger
statement expressed concern that he might try to rig the process in
a way that enables him to maintain control from his power base as
commander of the Panamanian Defense Force.
   Privately, U.S. officials expressed dismay with the outcome but
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger indicated in brief
remarks that the declaration has enough teeth to warrant U.S.
backing.
   Addressing delegates from the 31-member body assembled at the
ornate OAS headquarters, Eagleburger said the transfer of power
envisioned in the declaration ``must reflect the will of the
Panamanian people.''
   In addition, the new democratic elections called for must not be
held in ``one, two or three years but as soon as possible,''
consistent with the wording of the declaration, he said.
   ``General Noriega must go,'' Eagleburger added.
   The United States has called for the OAS to exert maximum
pressure on Noriega, who has been accused by two Florida grand
juries of drug smuggling activities.
   The ministers also extendeduntil Aug. 23 the mandate of an OAS
mediating team which has been trying to facilitate an end to the
two-month old political crisis in Panama.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter pledged his
government's full cooperation with the mediating team, which is
comprised of the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and
Trinidad and which has received the cooperation of OAS Secretary
General Joao Baena Soares.
   According to the Panamanian constitution, a new president is to
be installed Sept. 1. The Bush administration had hoped the OAS
would push for the installation as president of the opposition
candidate in the May 7 national elections.
   The results of that balloting were thrown out by Panama's
electoral tribunal amid widespread claims that Guillermo Endara,
the candidate opposed to Noriega, had won in a landslide.
   By calling for another round of elections after Sept. 1, the
OAS, in effect, accepted as permanent the annulment of the May 7
balloting.
   The reference to the need to abide by ``existing internal
Panamanian procedures'' also was seen as a concession to Noriega.

<TEXT>
   A delegation from the Organization of
American States arrived here today to investigate charges that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega scrapped the results of national elections
to prevent an opposition victory.
   ``We will organize our work and seek meetings with government
and political figures so we can return to Washington to present a
report filling the mandate of the OAS,'' OAS Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares said in a statement after arriving at the airport.
   The organization last week condemned Noriega, the nation's
military chief and de factor ruler, and called for a transfer of
power.
   Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador said the mission
would ``tell all Panamanian sectors that there is concern in Latin
America about Panama's crisis.''
   The delegation is being welcomed by Panama's opposition, which
wants the organization to recognize its victory in May 7
presidential elections. International observers say the opposition
won the elections by a 3-1 margin. Noriega nullified the vote after
it was apparent his candidates were losing.
   Panama's government has warned the mission should not be turned
into ``an international vote tabulation board or an international
court of appeal.''
   Noriega holds real power in Panama because he commands the
Panamanian Defense Forces. He has been indicted on drug charges in
the United States, charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to
renege on its commitment to give up the Panama Canal at the end of
1999.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Group Not Sufficiently Pressuring Nicaragua On Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Addressing the annual meeting of
the Organization of American States, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz criticized its members for not doing more to pressure
Nicaragua into democratic reforms.
   ``This organization has not always been out front on issues
concerning democracy,'' he said in the meetings' keynote speech.
   Shultz said Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government had
promised the OAS it would maintain a ``pluralistic'' political
system, but that member states had not held the Nicaraguans to their
commitment.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's vice-minister of foreign affairs,
disagreed.
   ``The general movement is towards discussion, towards
negotiation,'' he said during an informal press conference. ``The
OAS has started to take a political role in ending the Central
American crisis.''
   Tinoco noted that Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares has agreed
to a direct role in monitoring a now-stalled peace agreement between
the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateral
truce declared for the duration of the session by leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas opposed to the government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte.
   Duarte, in welcoming the delegates, condemned the guerrillas and
called for support for the overall Central American peace process,
   Other topics discussed at the General Assembly included Latin
American debt, the U.S. concern with drug trafficking and the OAS's
own financial straits.
   The OAS is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behind
on their dues. The United States, which provides the OAS
headquarters in Washington, owes $41 million.
   ``The member governments must decide what they want to do with
the OAS at this critical juncture in the life of the Americas,''
said Baena Soares, lamenting the organization's ``critical economic
condition.''
   The Brazilian was re-elected by acclamation to a second five-year
term as OAS secretary-general.
   An OAS commission has recommended that the group cut its $66
million annual budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of about 1,000
staff members.
   Delegates to the General Assembly will decide whether to accept
that recommendation this week.
   Shultz, who will be replaced by James A. Baker when
President-elect George Bush takes office in January, said he would
press for full funding by the U.S. Congress.
   The U.S. failure to pay its full contribution has been
interpreted by some Latin nations as an effort to reassert its
dominance over the OAS.
   ``The OAS's original sin is that it was founded to further U.S.
aims in Latin America,'' Tinoco said. ``But other countries are
trying to contribute a little more.''
   Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman who came to San Salvador to
press the rebels' case, questioned Tinoco's motives.
   ``They want negotiations on a biblical time scale _ to last a
thousand years,'' he told The Associated Press. ``They only want to
stretch things out to reinforce their grip.''
   At a news conference after his speech, Shultz pointed to the
exclusion of Panama from a meeting of Latin American nations last
month as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could be
taken by OAS nations.
   Panama, Shultz noted pointedly, was excluded from the ``Group of
Eight'' because it was no longer a democracy while under Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's thumb.
   In another speech to the assembly, Chile's foreign minister
Felipe Errazuriz reiterated the intention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
government to hold elections in 1989. However, he said, terrorism
was the major menace to the democratic process in Chile.

   U.S. officials said they were displeased with
the wording of preliminary draft resolutions intended for
Wednesday's emergency session of the Organization of American
States to discuss the Panama crisis.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Tuesday one
of their main objections to the draft resolutions by Venezuela and
Peru was that neither mentioned Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega by name.
   The United States is expected to push hard for a resolution
demanding that Noriega, Panama's military leader and de facto ruler
of the country, step down.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the May 7 electoral returns in Panama while asserting that the
solution to Panama's crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A U.S. official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the OAS secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in Panama.
   Among the 31 OAS members, the United States is aligned with a
cluster of democratic countries in Central and South America while
Mexico and Brazil are proponents of a less activist policy, citing
OAS provisions guaranteeing respect for the principle of
non-intervention.
   The meeting is being convened at the request of Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez, who reportedly favors a resolution
calling on Noriega to step down.
   The Bush administration position favors the recognition of the
opposition candidate in the May 7 election, Guillermo Endara, as
the legitimate authority in Panama. Four days after the election,
the State Department began referring to Endara as Panama's
``president-elect.''
   The House voted 413-0 on Tuesday to approve a resolution
condemning Noriega's ``reprehensible actions'' in thwarting the
election, and calling on him and the Panamanian military to
recognize Endara as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized Guillermo Endara as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution which
was sent to the Senate.
   It also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy steps'' taken
by President Bush ``as an appropriate and measured response to the
crisis in Panama.''
   ``We have a better indication of positive results than we have
come to expect in the past,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said of the reaction by Latin countries to the
administration's call for solidarity against Noriega.
   There is hope that the OAS will take a strong position, he said.
``On the other hand, we don't have any specific indication of what
the OAS might do,'' he said.
   He said he was unaware of an effort reported from diplomatic
sources in Panama that the United States is engaged in a petition
effort to get other countries to recall their ambassadors from
Panama as the United States has done.
   As to whether the administration wants Noriega to accept an
offer of refuge in Venezuela, Fitzwater said, the president's
feeling is that, ``he ought to take any offer he could get.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in Panama.
   Indicating that the United States plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, Boucher said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interests
in democracy.''
   Meanwhile, Panamanian diplomats are expected to try to convince
their hemispheric colleagues that Panama's problems are the product
of a systematic campaign of U.S. interventionism, including a
series of economic sanctions and a widely reported $10 million U.S.
government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the OAS charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   With a large majority of hemispheric countries headed by elected
governments, some delegates are expected to push hard for an
anti-Noriega resolution because to do otherwise might encourage
restive military officers to displace civilian presidents.
   But others are likely to be reluctant to push Noriega too hard,
particularly concerning allegations that he attempted to rig the
elections. These delegates may be wary about setting a precedent in
the event that the election processes in their own countries face
similar criticism.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, seemed guardedly
optimistic on Tuesday that a consensus existed for an anti-Noriega
resolution.
   ``The OAS is on the ropes,'' one official said, noting that the
organization is plagued by declining prestige and onrous financial
problems. About 300 OAS employees were laid off earlier this year.
   The official said it would make no sense for the OAS to ``create
a cloud of dust'' by convening a foreign ministers meeting and then
do nothing.
   A large turnout of foreign ministers will be on hand for the
special session, the first of its kind for the OAS since 1982 when
Britain and Argentina went to war over their conflicting claims to
the Falkland-Malvinas Islands.
   Among the handful of foreign ministers not expected to attend
are the ones from Brazil and Chile. They will be represented by
subordinates.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Bush called
presidential Endara on Tuesday ``to express sympathy over the
assault which Mr. Endara and his fellow leaders of the democratic
forces in Panamna suffered at the hands of the Noriega regime.''
   ``The president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the
hemisphere in the wake of Noriega's effort to steal the election by
force and fraud,'' he said.
   Popadiuk said he had no further information on the call.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega met with
an Organization of American States delegation and told them it
would be a dangerous precedent for them to interfere in a country's
internal affairs.
   Noriega also blamed the United States and its history of
intervention in Panama for the country's political crisis.
   ``Today it's Panama, tomorrow it could be any other country,''
the Defense Forces chief told journalists Wednesday after meeting
the OAS delegates.
   The OAS mission was sent in response to the Noriega-controlled
government's voiding of the May 7 presidential vote and the beating
of the top three opposition candidates by pro-Noriega thugs.
International observers say the opposition won the balloting by a
3-1 margin.
   Opposition leaders also met with the OAS delegation on Wednesday
and said they want their election victory recognized and Noriega
retired.
   About 300 marchers accompanied opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara and his running mates Ricardo Arias Calderon and
Guillermo Ford to the OAS delegation's hotel.
   The demonstration, in defiance of a government ban, was broken
up peacefully by about 25 riot police wielding bullhorns. Arias
Calderon said two opposition workers were arrested.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Noriega spokesman, said that when the
issue of retiring Noriega was raised, staff officers expressed
loyalty to Noriega and told the OAS delegates the matter was solely
up to the Defense Forces.
   When asked directly what he planned to do, Noriega thought a
second and said, ``That's the million-dollar question.''
   OAS spokesman Edgardo Costa called the 2{-hour discussion with
Noriega and his staff ``very informative.'' The visiting delegation
comprises the foreign ministers of Trinidad and Tobago, Guatemala
and Ecuador and OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares of Brazil.
   ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ...
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' Noriega joked.
   Washington has been working for Noriega's ouster since the
general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida last
year.
   After the opposition candidates were beaten, President Bush sent
1,900 extra troops to augment security at U.S. Panama Canal
installations.
   The troops have conducted exercises and run armed convoys along
Panamanian roads, as permitted by the 1977 treaties under which the
United States must turn the canal over to Panama in 1999.
   Noriega, who denies the drug charges, claims the United States
is trying to oust him because it does not want to give up the canal
it built and protected for so long.
   ``Noriega has a historical perspective on the issues,'' said
Costa, the OAS spokesman. He said Noriega's talk went back to how
the United States _ wanting a canal _ helped found Panama in 1903
by aiding its secession from Colombia.
   The OAS passed a resolution last week criticizing Noriega and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Panamanian government said some aspects of the resolution,
including the mention of Noriega, violate the OAS charter. It said
it would accept no interference in Panama's internal affairs.
   Noriega holds power in Panama through his command of the Defense
Forces, which have so far remained loyal despite U.S. and
opposition calls for a coup.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma told an open meeting of
government bureaucrats on Wednesday that no new elections are
possible before Sept. 1, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' ends.
   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle in the presidency
after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 following
Noriega's indictment on U.S. drug-trafficking and money laundering
charges.
   Noriega denies the charges.
   The meeting with the OAS was pointedly held in a building in the
Panamanian section of Fort Amador, a former U.S. installation at
the edge of Panama City.
   The fence that surrounds the building abuts a U.S. naval
station, and even Noriega must pass a U.S. military policeman to
enter the area.

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers are meeting again with deep divisions remaining over how
much pressure they should bring to bear on Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega to surrender power.
   As the OAS prepared to meet today, the State Department was
expressing deep disappointment over the lack of enthusiasm among
many delegates for taking decisive action against Noriega.
   These delegates, led by Mexico, cite provisions protecting member
nations against outside intervention. They also see the problem
concerning Noriega as essentially a U.S.-Panamanian issue, not one
which should involve the OAS.
   But the Bush administration has become increasingly impatient
with what it regards as foot dragging by the 31-member OAS. U.S.
officials, insisting on anonymity, said early drafts of a speech
prepared for Secretary of State James A. Baker III for today's
meeting were sharply worded.
   Baker was returning to his office today after his two-week trip
to Europe with President Bush and it was not clear beforehand
whether he or a subordinate would represent the United States at the
meeting.
   As Baker sees it, the administration bowed to Latin wishes by
assuming a low profile in the Panamanian situation and giving the
OAS a chance to forge a solution, the U.S. officials said.
   The Latin Americans had contended the Reagan administration too
often had acted unilaterally in confronting hemispheric problems and
that a multi-lateral approach was far preferable.
   But U.S. officials complain the OAS has shown no stomach for
acting decisively against Noriega, who is under indictment in
Florida on drug smuggling charges.
   Anti-Noriega sentiment in the OAS grew last May after Panamanian
authorities threw out the results of the May 7 national elections
amid widespread allegations that the candidate opposed to Noriega
was the landslide winner. The opposition presidential and vice
presidential candidate were beaten by pro-Noriega forces when they
tried to stage a public rally.
   The OAS met in emergency session May 17 and appointed a team of
mediators to go to Panama with a mandate to achieve a democratic
``transfer of power'' in Panama.
   One deadline for achieving that objective passed on June 6 and a
second deadline was set for today.
   The OAS mediators are more optimistic than the State Department
about a settlement, pointing to two meetings in recent days between
Panamanian opposition and government leaders.
   U.S. officials viewed those meetings as an attempt by Noriega to
dampen still further whatever desire the OAS may still have for
involvement in the Panama question.
   The Panamanian government hoped today's meeting would end with no
extension of the mediators' mandate.
   Expressions of impatience with the OAS already are being heard
from lawmakers as ideologically diverse as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. There is even a movement in the
Senate to leave vacant for an extended period the post of U.S.
ambassador to the OAS.
   Meetings among the Latin delegates were held Tuesday at the
Colombian Embassy and elsewhere in an attempt to reach a consensus
on the Panamanian problem.
   With the results of the May 7 election nullified and with no
announced winner, it is not clear what will happen in Panama on
September 1, the date on which the Panamanian constitution says a
new president is to take office.

   The Bush administration is prepared to urge an
escalation of pressure on Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
if he ignores an Organization of American States call for a
transfer of power, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   After OAS foreign ministers approved a resolution on Panama
Wednesday, senior U.S. officials met with Latin American diplomats
Thursday to discuss strategy for dealing with Noriega in the event
he refuses to cooperate with OAS mediators.
   The key provision of the resolution empowers the mediators to
try to promote a ``national accord, within democratic mechanisms
and in the shortest period possible, to ensure the transfer of
power with full respect for the sovereign will of Panamanian
people.''
   The resolution also blames Noriega for ``grave events and
abuses'' in Panama since national elections were held on May 7. The
election returns were tossed out amid allegations of widespread
fraud.
   One of the U.S. officials, commenting on condition he not be
named, said there was a simple reason why the ministers overcame an
initial reluctance to criticize Noriega by name in their resolution.
   ``Nobody there disagreed with the proposition that we ought to
try to get rid of Noriega,'' he said.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter promised his government
will cooperate fully with the mediators, but there was little
expectation here that the negotiation will go smoothly.
   If it becomes apparent that Noriega is intent on clinging to
power, the resolution allows for ``subsequent measures'' to be
taken against him.
   The officials pointed out that, a decade ago, it took three OAS
foreign ministers meetings to win approval of a resolution calling
for the resignation of then-Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza.
   They suggested that if Noriega responds to the Wednesday night
resolution by digging in his heels, the OAS could take the same
action against Noriega that it did against Somoza in 1979.
   The officials said Noriega will have difficulty attempting to
portray his government's problems as U.S.-inspired because the
resolution was a Latin American initiative.
   Panama has said the United States systematically sought to
subvert the election process there and has committed economic
aggression against Panama through sanctions.
   President Bush praised the OAS resolution Thursday and his
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're gratified that the OAS
countries shared the United States' position.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``Noriega should listen to the clear message from his people and
from his neighbors. It's time for him to leave.''
   Appointed as OAS mediators were the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad. They will fly to Panama on Monday
for consultations with Panamanian authorities.
   The mediators are assigned to report back to their fellow
hemispheric foreign ministers after June 5.

   An Organization of American States
mission has arrived in Panama for a third attempt to find a solution
to the country's electoral crisis.
   ``We came here to get a clear view of the situation,'' OAS
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares said late Thursday.
   The OAS mission arrived only hours after the opposition rejected
the latest government proposal for a junta to take over on Sept. 1,
the constitutional inauguration day.
   International observers say the opposition led by presidential
candidate Guillermo Endara won the May 7 national elections by a 3-1
margin. The opposition wants its victory recognized.
   The government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler, annulled the
election on May 10.
   In addition to having its victory recognized, the opposition
wants Noriega to resign, something the United States has sought
since last year.
   ``We feel that our proposal for a three-way negotiation involving
the government, the opposition and the military has been accepted,''
another member of the OAS mission, Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego
Cordovez, said. ``The important thing is to clear up details for a
negotiation.''
   The mission is to meet with government officials and opposition
leaders and then submit a report to the OAS in Washington on July 19.
   Endara said last week that he has been disappointed with the OAS
efforts so far.
   The opposition had expected the OAS negotiators to put more
pressure the government to enter negotiations that include Noriega.
   The United States, which says Noriega is a drug-trafficking
dictator, has thrown its support behind the opposition by imposing
economic sanctions on Panama.
   Noriega says the United States, which indicted him last year on
drug-trafficking charges, is trying to set the stage to renege on
the 1977 treaties that hand the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of the century.

hard for a tough resolution denouncing Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega when Organization of American States foreign
ministers meet next week to discuss the Panama crisis.
   But Panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in
their country on what they regard as systematic U.S. intervention
in Panama's internal affairs.
   The OAS permanent council on Friday approved a Venezuelan
proposal for the OAS foreign ministers to meet next Wednesday to
discuss the ``serious crisis'' in Panama.
   While many delegates expressed concern about the interruption of
the election process and the violence directed against some
Panamanian opposition leaders, others argued against interfering in
Panama's internal affairs.
   Panama's representative, Carlos Russell, used the occasion to
blast U.S. actions, saying, ``We will not bow to the colossus of
the north.''
   He cited reports alleging that the Bush administration donated
$10 million to the opposition candidate's campaign. He also said
the U.S. government had funded a clandestine anti-government radio
operation, that preparations were being made to scuttle the Panama
Canal treaties and that U.S. military forces in Panama are engaged
in hostile military maneuvers.
   But the U.S. delegate, William Pryce, said that in the interest
of the people of Panama the OAS must raise its collective voice
``against the dictator Noriega and demand that he respect the will
of the courageous people of Panama.''
   On Thursday, the State Department began referring to the
opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, as the president-elect of
Panama, based on exit polls showing he had a sizeable lead over the
pro-Noriega candidate, Carlos Duque.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said there
seemed to be little likelihood that the OAS foreign ministers would
designate Endara as the winner. There also was some doubt that the
OAS would approve a resolution condemning Noriega, the officials
said.
   The United States was expected to fight hard for a toughly
worded resolution, but strong resistance was anticipated from a
number of countries, especially Mexico and Nicaragua, both of which
attach high priority to the principle of non-interference.
   Even Venezuela, which initiated the call for a foreign ministers
meeting, was restrained in outlining its reasons.
   Ambassador Edilberto Moreno made no direct reference to Noriega,
saying only that ``the popular will'' of hemispheric nations must
be respected and that a meeting of foreign ministers at this time
is appropriate given the ``grave crisis'' in Panama.
   The strongest anti-Noriega statement during the meeting was
delivered by Jamaican Ambassador Keith Johnson, who denounced
``this blatant rape of democracy'' in Panama.

<HEAD>OAS Mission Leaves Panama After Failing to Bring About Negotiations</HEAD>

   A delegation from the Organization of
American States left Panama on Saturday after four days of futile
talks aimed at finding a solution to Panama's political crisis.
   The delegates indicated they would ask that another OAS mission
travel to Panama soon for additional talks with Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and the political forces trying to oust him.
   Noriega, who blames the United States for Panama's troubles,
told the mission it was up to the political parties to sit down and
negotiate. Opposition leaders insisted Noriega must negotiate
because he is the real power in Panama.
   ``There are complex problems and deep emotions involved in the
Panamanian situation,'' said Diego Cordovez, Ecuadoran foreign
minister and member of the four-man delegation.
   ``We have promoted communication between the different political
sectors,'' Cordovez said. ``We have fullfilled our mandate.''
   He said the mission met with government and opposition leaders
as well as Roman Catholic Church officials and other groups and
made them all aware of the different points of view.
   ``Unfortunately, there has been no progress for the good of
Panama,'' said Guillermo Endara, the opposition's presidential
candidate in May 7 elections.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' Noriega said. ``They
both claim they won.''
   The OAS sent the mission, headed by Secretary-General Joao Baena
Soares, to seek a solution to the impasse created by the annullment
of the elections. International observers say Noriega's hand-picked
candidate, Carlos Duque, lost to Endara.
   The Panamanian government claimed the United States interfered
openly in favor of the opposition by providing financial assistance
and by repeatedly calling for the ouster of Noriega, the Defense
Forces chief and the power behind the government.
   Washington obtained a public condemnation of Noriega from the
OAS, which also blamed Noriega for post-election violence,
including attacks on the opposition candidates.
   The OAS delegates will submit a full report on their mission to
the OAS, which must decide what to do next.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, but he denies the allegations and says
Washington wants him out of power so it can renege on the Panama
Canal treaties.
   Under those treaties, the United States must hand over control
of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.

   The State Department on Friday praised an
Organization of American States resolution calling for early
elections in Panama and condemning the ``serious violations'' of
human rights occurring there.
   The resolution was approved 25 to 2 shortly before midnight
Thursday by the OAS General Assembly. Only Panama and Nicaragua
voted in opposition.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
resolution ``repudiates and isolates'' the government of Panama's
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and is the strongest OAS statement to
date on that issue.
   At a separate news conference, the new U.S. ambassador to the
OAS, Luigi Einaudi, expressed regret that the resolution did not
mention Noriega by name but added that the isolation of the
Panamanian leader is ``now visible for everyone to see.''
   The Bush administration, which considers the Noriega-led
government to be illigitimate, was pleased that at no point in the
resolution was there any reference to the ``Panamanian government.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the resolution ``deprives Noriega of any
pretext of legitimacy. We applaud the firm stand taken by the
Organization of American States, which can only serve to encourage
a return to democracy for the people of Panama, support for human
rights and an end to the brutal Noriega dictatorship.''

<HEAD>Panama Bars Street Protests During OAS Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with government banning demonstrations.

   The government today prohibited
street demonstrations in Panama until at least June 5.
   The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique
saying the prohibition was imposed in response to the visit next
week by delegates from the Organization of American States, or OAS.
   The move came after Panama accused the U.S. Embassy of
involvement in post-election violence earlier this month that left
three opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards dead.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and
Tobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are
due in Panama on Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of
Panama's 15-month-old crisis.
   The OAS on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Panama's
de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whom it held
responsible for ``abuses.''
   International observers say opposition candidates were winning
the national election on May 7 when the government annulled the
results. Since then, there has been no decision on how to select a
replacement for acting President Manuel Solis Palma, whose term
ends Sept. 1.
   The government said the prohibition of marches, rallies and
demonstrations is in response to the clause in the OAS resolution
calling on ``the authorities and all political forces in Panama to
abstain from any measure or action that could aggravate the
crisis.''
   The government communique said the prohibition will remain in
effect until the three foreign ministers present their report on
the Panamanian situation at OAS headquarters in Washington. The OAS
gave them until June 5 to do so.
   Late Friday, U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone, responding
to a government communique, said the attempt to link the U.S.
government to the election-related violence was ``propaganda
foolishness.''
   Police arrested 17 Panamanians who provide security at U.S.
Embassy offices, the embassy reported Friday. Fifteen were quickly
released, embassy officials said.
   The government said the guards were questioned as part of an
investigation into violence May 10, three days after the national
election.
   The 17 work for the same private security company that employed
an opposition politician's bodyguard who was killed and another who
was wounded when Noriega supporters attacked members of the
opposition with sticks, pipes and rubber whips.
   The government claimed the bodyguards were trained by the U.S.
military, whose presence was bolstered when President Bush recently
sent in nearly 1,900 troops to U.S. bases to protect American
nationals in the country.
   Also Friday, the pro-Noriega news media attacked the OAS, saying
it had prostituted itself in approving a resolution critical of
Panama.
   The newspaper Critica printed a half-page cartoon on Friday
showing a naked Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica and winner of
the Nobel Peace Prize, licking the feet of a U.S. Army general.
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was shown waiting his turn
to do the same.
   The governments of Arias and Perez promoted the resolution
adopted Wednesday by the OAS that criticized Noriega, who also is
head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   The 17 Panamanians who were detained work for Tesna Protective
Services, an American company that operates in Panama under the
name Minsa. The company provides by contract 87 employees who serve
as security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They are not
employees of the U.S. Embassy.
   The bodyguard killed in the May 10 violence was Alexis Guerra, a
Minsa employee who was on leave from the company while he protected
opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford. Among the
wounded was another bodyguard, Humberto Montenegro, who had been
employed by Minsa until early this year when he resigned to work as
Ford's bodyguard. The government has said five Defense Force
soldiers were injured in the melee.
   A communique issued Friday night by the attorney general's
office accused the U.S. Embassy of lying to the media about the
detention of the 17 Minsa employees and claimed the embassy
presented the detentions as harassment.
   The statement also said ``high authorities'' of the U.S. Embassy
assigned Guerra and Montenegro to guard Ford. It claimed the two
men and other Minsa guards were trained in the use of arms and
explosives by U.S. military units stationed in Panama.
   Kneebone said both allegations were false. He said the embassy
conferred with the 15 who were released.

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers tentatively agreed to grant OAS mediators an additional
month to help promote a solution to the political crisis in Panama
but deferred until Thursday a decision on other key aspects of a
formal declaration.
   The deliberations adjourned at 1:02 a.m. EDT Thursday after
negotiations that began Wednesday morning at the Colombian Embassy.
   A draft proposal calls for a transfer of power in Panama on Sept.
1, 1989, and the holding of free elections in the briefest period
possible. These steps are to be carried out through ``democratic
means and in conformity with existing internal Panamanian
procedures.''
   U.S. and Panamanian opposition representatives attending the
meeting expressed disappointment with the proposal, contending that
it could be interpreted by Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
to his advantage.
   Their comments indicated that efforts to toughen the language
would be made at the Thursday session to bring additional pressure
to bear on Noriega.
   Addressing the meeting at OAS headquarters in early evening, U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger issued a forceful
appeal for decisive OAS action to ensure the restoration of
democratic rule in Panama.
   ``It is time to end the crisis in Panama and the suffering of the
Panamanian people,'' Eagleburger said.
   OAS inaction would invite military leaders elsewhere in the
hemisphere to oust elected governments, he added.
   He said that drug traffickers also would be encouraged if the OAS
refuses to meet the challenge in Panama.
   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, a member of the
mediating team, said he believes two months of efforts by him and
his colleagues have raised the possibility of a ``national accord''
leading to a restoration of democratic rule in Panama.
   He said the basis for his hope was the contacts in recent days
between government and opposition leaders in Panama aimed at
reaching a solution.
   Cordovez was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a
democratic outcome by Sept. 1. According to Panama's constitution, a
new president must be sworn in by that date.
   The possibility of a national accord was alluded to in a report
the mediators submitted to the meeting Wednesday, the deadline for
the mediation team.
   Some delegates felt that the discussions in Panama could lead to
a government of national reconciliation and most foreign ministers
felt there was no alterative but to extend the deadline.
   Delegates were expected to extend the mandate of the mediating
team until late August but there was disagreement over the precise
date and other aspects of the final declaration.
   Opposition leaders in Panama said Wednesday they would not agree
to any such proposal for a government of national reconciliation.
   ``We are not going to betray the Panamanian people. We are not
going to accept that junta even if they give it the name of National
Reconstruction,'' said Guillermo Endara, the opposition presidential
candidate in May 7 elections.
   Intense give-and-take behind closed doors delayed the official
opening of Wednesday's meeting by about four hours. After a public
session lasting less than an hour, the meeting was recessed as
delegates continued behind-the-scenes efforts to reach a compromise
on the wording of an official declaration.
   The crisis was precipitated by the decision of Panama's electoral
authorities to annul the outcome of presidential elections May 7.
   Independent observers said the candidate opposed to Noriega, the
head of the Defense Forces, had won a landslide victory.
   The OAS on May 17 appointed its mediating team to promote a
democratic ``transfer of power'' in Panama. It also blamed Noriega
for the ``grave events'' that occurred in connection with the
elections _ a reference to bloody attacks on opposition candidates
by government security forces.
   There was strong sentiment in the OAS, particularly among some
South American governments, not to bring too much pressure to bear
on Panama.
   The OAS charter forbids interference in the internal affairs of
member countries.
   But the Bush administration, which has been a strong advocate of
using maximum pressure to force Noriega out, has been saying the
charter also lists democracy as the system of government that all
member states should adhere to.
   U.S. opposition to Noriega also was based on drug smuggling
indictments handed down last year against him by two Florida grand
juries.
   U.S. officials also argued that OAS credibility in the hemisphere
could be preserved only by a strong stand against Noriega.
   Opposition to Noriega led the U.S. Senate to state Wednesday, in
a provision added to a State Department bill, that it would not
accept any nominee for administrator of the Panama Canal selected by
him.
   The treaty under which the United States will turn over the canal
to Panama calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the
White House to be appointed next year by Panama and confirmed by the
Senate.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told an
international delegation Wednesday that the United States is to
blame for Panama's political crisis.
   ``We told them our truth,'' the general, Panama's de facto
leader, said in a brief statement after meeting with Organization
of American States delegates for 2{ hours.
   Noriega, commander of the armed forces, told a news conference
the three-hour meeting had been ``postive'' and gave the Defense
Forces ``an opportunity to express their idea about the economic
aggression .... and the foreign intervention that caused the
deterioration'' in Panama.
   ``Each officer spoke of his concept of this reality,'' he went
on. ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ....
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' he joked.
   President Bush sent about 2,000 extra U.S. troops to Panama
after the government nullified the May 7 presidential election and
Noriega supporters beat up opposition candidates.
   When he was asked what he planned to do, Noriega thought a
second and said, ``That's the million dollar question.''
   An aide said Noriega told the delegation his resignation is an
issue that would be decided by the Defense Forces, not by an OAS
request.
   International observers say the election was won by opposition
candidate Guillermo Endara over Noriega's candidate, Carlos Duque.
The government said Duque won.
   The delegation, led by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares,
included foreign ministers Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, Mario
Palencia of Guatemala and Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad and Tobago.
   Earlier, the delegates met with leaders of the opposition and
the Roman Catholic Church. Opposition leaders told the delegation
they wanted their election victory recognized and Noriega retired.
   ``We want democracy and justice for the people of Panama,''
Endara said after meeting with the delegation.
   Endara and his two vice-presidential candidates, Ricardo Arias
Calderon and Guillermo Ford, were accompanied by 300 cheering
supporters as they marched several blocks from a church to the OAS
delegation's hotel.
   About 25 riot police wielding bullhorns peacefully dispersed the
crowd. Opposition spokesmen said one bodyguard and an Arias
Calderon aide were arrested.
   Acting president Manuel Solis Palma said no new elections were
possible before Sept. 1, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' is supposed to end.
   Solis Palma told a meeting of bureaucrats that new balloting
could not be held because of the expense and ``because of the
psychological condition of the Panmanian people after the trauma of
the elections.''
   He suggested he would continue in office, citing an
administrative code that says a person must serve until he is
replaced.
   ``Juridically, there is no problem, but politically we will have
to define a transfer of power,'' he said, adding, ``It could
possibly be the succession of one person by another of the same
group.''
   After the nullification, the OAS passed a resolution criticizing
Noriega and calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest
possible time.''
   ``We want recognition of our electoral victory and the
retirement of General Noriega,'' Arias Calderon said Wednesday.
   ``We will not betray the people. The May 7 vote is a mandate
from God,'' said Endara. ``The OAS listened but didn't want to
comment. They said they would like to meet again.''
   The march Wednesday marked the fourth time the opposition has
defied a government ban on demonstrations in effect until June 5,
when the OAS commission is due to file its report.
   On Tuesday night, the Panamanian government presented its case
against the United States during a meeting with the OAS delegation.
   Solis Palma's government has said it hoped the mission would
``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between Panama
and the United States'' and cited U.S. economic sanctions as proof
of malice.
   The government also has proclaimed it will accept no
interference in internal Panamanian affairs and that some aspects
of the OAS resolution violate the OAS charter.
   The first street demonstrations against Noriega's rule began in
June of 1987.
   Since then Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drug charges,
charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to renege on its commitment
to give up the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.

   A senior State Department official left Friday
on a four-nation visit to Central America for talks expected to
focus on the situation in Nicaragua and Panama, U.S. officials said.
   Bernard Aronson, the newly installed assistant secretary of state
for inter-American affairs, planned to visit Guatemala, Honduras, El
Salvador and Costa Rica.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Aronson would
discuss preparations in Nicaragua for national elections next Feb.
25. The Bush administration has accused the Sandinista government of
trying to rig the process in its favor.
   But Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommitttee on Latin America, said Thursday he expects
the Nicaraguan elections will be free and fair and that the
Sandinista goverment deserves some credit from the Bush
administration.
   The consultations on Panama are expected to center on next
Wednesday's meeting of Organization of American States foreign
ministers in Washington.
   The ministers are scheduled to receive a report from a team of
mediators who have been trying to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in Panama in accordance with an OAS mandate.
   According to the officials, Aronson briefed a number of Latin
American ambassadors on Thursday about the situation in Panama.
   Aronson told the envoys that the Bush administration, consistent
with Latin American wishes, has adopted a low profile on the Panama
situation in the interest of seeking a resolution of the problem
through hemispheric consensus, the officials said.
   Aronson also said it would be unfortunate for the OAS if the
mediators failed to achieve a solution in Panama that would result
in the transfer of power from Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
commander of the Defense Forces, to an elected civilian government,
the officials said.
   At his news conference Thursday, Dodd criticized the OAS for what
he said was its ineffective response to the situation in Panama.
   If the OAS cannot deal with the Panama problem, ``I don't think
we can get together on anything,'' he said. ``They might as well
close down the (OAS) building.''
   Panama has faced an uncertain political future since the results
of the May 7 national elections were thrown out by Panamanian
authorities. Independent observers had maintained that the
presidential candidate opposed to Noriega scored a landslide victory.

THERE'S SOLID PRECEDENT IN SEEKING OAS CONSENSUS ON ISOLATING NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANTINE C. MENGES, Constantine C. Menges, resident scholar at the 
American Enterprise Institute, was responsible for Latin America as a former 
special assistant to President Ronald Reagan. His latest book is Inside the 
National Security Council (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1984, Panama joined the many other Latin American countries that made the 
transition from military rule to constitutional democracy during the Ronald 
Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, 1985, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega forced his country's elected 
president to resign -- the first step back from the movement toward democracy 
in Latin America. As a member of the national security staff in the Reagan 
White House, I was unsuccessful in efforts to bring this issue before the 
President. Yet I believed then, as I do today, that the failure to help the 
people of Panama restore democracy would cause ever graver crises involving 
larger human and strategic costs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
After this month's fraudulent elections and the accompanying violence against 
opposition leaders, President Bush should use the full resources of the United 
States to help the people of Panama restore democracy. He has a bipartisan 
consensus about the facts in Panama in support of his initial diplomatic and 
military steps. 
</P>
<P>
The objective now should be the removal of Noriega and his clique of 
collaborators with the installation of the newly elected government of the 
Panamanian democratic opposition. The United States should take the lead to 
accomplish this through the collective security instruments of the Organization 
of American States. 
</P>
<P>
The first step would be a quiet process of briefing and persuasion in order to 
build a consensus among a two-thirds majority of the 32 OAS members. After that 
consensus has been obtained informally -- and with competent diplomacy this can 
be done quickly -- the issues should be presented for formal action by the OAS. 
</P>
<P>
There is an important precedent, which was undertaken by the Jimmy Carter 
Administration in 1979. At that time, the OAS decided that due to the "conduct 
of the dictatorial regime governing the country . . . the spirit of hemispheric 
solidarity . . . places an unavoidable obligation on the American countries to 
. . . bring about the immediate and definitive replacement of the . . . regime 
(with the) installation . . . of a democratic government . . ." Those words 
resulted in the total isolation of the Anastasio Somoza regime in Nicaragua. 
They should be applied to the Noriega dictatorship today. And, also following 
the 1979 precedent, OAS diplomatic recognition should be conferred on a 
Panamanian government that represents the democratic aspirations of the people. 
</P>
<P>
With those steps having been taken and virtually all OAS member states having 
isolated Noriega diplomatically and economically, efforts should then be made 
to persuade our allies in the Atlantic Alliance and other key Free World 
countries to do the same. With some creativity, it is possible to find ways of 
channeling economic help through the Panamanian liberation government to the 
people of Panama -- especially the poorest -- so that it is the Noriega regime 
that bears the principal weight of this political and economic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
With these first collective security measures in place, there should be a final 
offer to Noriega and his clique. In the interest of avoiding further disruption 
and possible violence, Noriega and his faction could resign with the promise 
that there would be no retribution, prosecution or confiscation of their 
current property holdings now or at any time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If that last offer is rejected, then the Bush Administration must be prepared 
to take all necessary means to help the people of Panama -- including the 
sensible majority of the Panamanian military -- accomplish the objectives of 
the OAS resolution and restore democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to act until democracy is restored will consign the courageous people 
of Panama to servitude under a Noriega regime that month by month has been 
moving closer into the Cuban orbit. Already Cuba provides bodyguards, secret 
police and military personnel who have been training a new, more politically 
reliable (though still small) military force and have been helping Noriega in 
his campaign of repression, harassment of U.S. military personnel and with drug 
smuggling. Unless Bush acts effectively, he risks the chance of Noriega 
becoming the Moammar Kadafi of the Caribbean -- a setback for the cause of 
democracy in this hemisphere and a growing risk to the Panama Canal.

   Foreign ministers of eight Latin
American countries opened a conference Wednesday at which they will
consider calling for the readmission of Cuba to the Organization of
American States.
   The foreign ministers of Peru, Panama, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay, Venezuela and Argentina are scheduled to meet for three
days in the Colombian port city of Cartagena.
   Also on the agenda are peace efforts in Central America, British
naval drills near the Falklands, the region's $400 billion foreign
debt and increased policing of drug trafficking, said Esther Lozano
de Rey, chief secretary for the Colombian Foreign Ministry.
   The ministers make up what is called the Group of Eight,
organized last year mainly to monitor the situation in Central
America.
   Mrs. Lozano de Rey told The Associated Press that a preliminary
agenda for the Group of Eight meeting, drawn up by assistants to
the foreign ministers, included a proposal to support Cuba's
re-entry into the OAS.
   Cuba was expelled from the organization in 1962, three years
after Fidel Castro came to power.
   In a meeting of the eight Latin American countries' presidents
last November in Acapulco, Mexico, President Jose Sarney of Brazil
told reporters that the leaders had agreed that the communist
nation should be readmitted to the OAS. However, such a statement
was not included in a final document from the meeting.
   The U.S. State Department has said the United States can not
support the readmission of Cuba to the OAS until that country stops
trying to subvert democratic rule in the hemisphere.
   At the Cartagena meeting, the Latin American ministers are
considering calling for an end to the British naval maneuvers that
have taken place around the Falklands Islands in the south Atlantic
since the 1982 war between Argentina and Britain, according to Ms.
Lozano de Rey.
   Argentina invaded the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but
later surrendered to the British.
   The ministers planned to discuss a statement urging wealthy
countries to fight consumption of cocaine and calling on the eight
Latin American countries to work to cut production of the drug.
   Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are South America's three biggest
cocaine-producing countries.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Abadia, said Wednesday his
government is not discounting the possibility of U.S. military
intervention in Panama because of the indictment on drug
trafficking charges of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
Panama's armed forces.
   If there is an invasion, ``we won't have the capacity to stop
it,'' Abadia said.
   The Reagan administration publicly called for Noriega to step
down following his indictment this month by a federal grand jury in
Miami.
   Abadia said the charges do not constitute an attack on Noriega
but on the Panamanian military. He claimed the charges are an
attempt to break the treaty under which the United States has
promised to turn the Panama Canal to Panama by the year 2000.
   When the meeting ends, the eight foreign ministers will head for
Hamburg, West Germany for a series of meetings with Central
American officials on the situation in their region.

   On the eve of a major international conference
on the Panama crisis, U.S. officials believe the position of
military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega has been severely weakened.
   ``He's in trouble,'' said U.S. ambassador Arthur Davis, who
returned home Monday for an indefinite stay as part of a series of
measures taken by President Bush in response to fraud allegations
and violence surrounding last week's Panamanian election.
   Organization of American States foreign ministers meet here on
Wednesday to determine whether a common stand is possible on the
Panamanian situation.
   It will be the first special meeting of OAS foreign ministers
since the Falkland-Malvinas crisis of 1982.
   Meanwhile, the House Foreign Affairs Committee today approved on
a voice vote a resolution condemning Noriega's ``reprehensible
actions'' in thwarting the election and calling on him and the
Panamanian military to recognize Endara as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized Guillermo Endara as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution, which
was expected to be approved later in the day by the full House.
   The statement also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy
steps'' taken by Bush ``as an appropriate and measured response to
the crisis in Panama.''
   Given the international outcry against Noriega's actions, U.S.
officials were cautiously optimistic that a strong stand in the OAS
will be taken.
   Panamanian officials already have indicated that they plan to
try to portray the situation in Panama as the product of U.S.
interventionism. A Noriega-controlled tribunal annulled the
election results last week, claiming outsiders had compromised the
balloting.
   A Panamanian envoy, Carlos Russell, has alleged that the U.S.
government has engaged in economic aggression against Panama and
spent $10 million in support of opposition candidates during the
presidential campaign.
   Davis refused to comment Monday when asked about the allegations.
   At least two dozen countries have spoken out against Noriega
since the returns from the May 7 elections were tossed out amid
charges of fraud and the beating of opposition candidates during an
anti-government demonstration.
   There is no possibility of OAS sanctions against Noriega but
nonetheless, U.S. officials believe an OAS statement condemning
Noriega, combined with his weakened position domestically, could
hasten his eventual departure.
   Davis spoke to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base on Monday
after a flight from Panama. He said there are increasing signs that
Noriega's situation is becoming untenable.
   One is that the government appears to lack the resources to pay
civil service employees, he said. Another is that the nominal head
of government, President Manuel Solis Palma, has disappeared from
public view since the election.
   Before departing from Panama, Davis accused Noriega of directing
an attack on the life of Guillermo Ford, a vice presidential
candidate in the May 7 election.
   After his arrival here, Davis elaborated on his allegation.
   With Ford prostrate on the floor of an automobile and a
bodyguard lying on top of him for protection, a member of an armed
pro-government force known as the Dignity Battalion opened fire
into the vehicle, Davis said. The bodyguard was killed.
   ``You don't put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire at
the people in it unless you're planning to kill somebody,'' Davis
said.
   Asked about the link to Noriega, Davis replied, ``Well, they're
his men. Nobody else ordered it except Noriega. The Dignity
Battalions are under his control.''
   The Dignity Battalions, Davis said, ``have about as much dignity
as a rat.''
   The battalions have been widely portrayed as young unemployed
thugs hired by the Panamanian government but Davis said some were
Panamanian Defense Force personnel in disguise.
   Davis said U.S. officials have photographs showing PDF personnel
changing into Dignity Battalion garb on the day Ford and other
opposition candidates were attacked.

Panamanian President Guillermo Endara by an unidentified 
reporter on the 27 March OAS secretary general elections; in 
Panama City on 27 March; from the "RPC News" newscast] 
  [Text] With 20 votes in his favor, Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria today was elected to replace Brazilian Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares as OAS secretary general. Despite 
diplomatic efforts by Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
to secure the post for Central America, Niehaus obtained only 14 
votes, including one from Panama. For our country, however, 
this was a very difficult decision, because both candidates 
hailed from neighboring countries with which we maintain good 
relations -- Colombia and Costa Rica. 
  In statements to RPC Radio, Panamanian President Guillermo 
Endara voiced his belief that Gaviria will do a good job and 
that the OAS will assume a new role under his leadership. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Although we were committed to 
Costa Rica, I am certain President Gaviria will prove to be a 
historic OAS secretary general. I think the time during which 
the OAS was a dormant, inactive organization has ended. We will 
now see a new OAS with Gaviria as secretary general. We will 
see a dynamic OAS -- an OAS that will promote democracy in the 
hemisphere, one that will promote liberty. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, as for Panama, what expectations 
does the Panamanian Government have in the wake of the Colombian 
President's election? 
  [Endara] President Gaviria reiterated to me -- in fact, he 
has told me repeatedly since he began his bid for the post of 
secretary general -- that regardless of how Panama voted, he 
wanted to have Panama's support, much like Panama would want to 
have his support. I told him that if he was indeed elected, 
Panama would support him not only during my presidency, but that 
I am certain any and all of the seven presidential candidates 
will also support him. I told him I could guarantee this 
support, because we will have a four-month transition period 
during which I hope to maintain good relations with the winner 
of the Panamanian elections. I also told him I am sure we will 
agree that the new president should support Gaviria at the OAS. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, do you think the support the 
United 
States gave the Colombian president's candidacy was the decisive 
factor in today's vote? 
  [Endara] No, no, no. I honestly do not think so. Our vote 
is an example. Although the United States lobbied strongly 
through diplomatic channels, I think President Gaviria has 
merits of his own and qualities that make him an excellent 
candidate. Gaviria, in my opinion, would have won even without 
U.S. backing. [end recording] 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 47, will probably assume 
the post of OAS secretary general in August.

   A mission from the Organization of
American States arrived Sunday for its second try at mediating the
month-old election crisis, and the legislature's speaker urged the
group to focus on what he called U.S. meddling.
   The four-man delegation includes OAS Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares and the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad
and Tobago.
   The OAS mission failed on its trip in May to negotiate an end to
the crisis, touched off when the government led by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega annulled results of the May 7 presidential election.
   International observers say that when the counting was halted the
opposition candidate had a 3-to-1 margin of victory over the one
backed by the Noriega-controlled government.
   The opposition insists Noriega, head of the Defense Forces, must
resign and that its victory be recognized. The government says
Noriega's status is not negotiable and has proposed that a
provisional junta take power Sept. 1, the constitutional
inauguration date.
   The speaker of the Noriega-dominated Legislative Assembly on
Sunday made public an open letter to the OAS asking it to focus its
efforts on U.S. actions, not those of Noriega.
   ``The fundamental reasons for the Panamanian crisis are rooted in
the open U.S. intervention in our internal affairs aimed at
maintaining hegemony in Panama and the region,'' Celso Carrizo said
in the letter.
   ``This intervention is carried through slander, disinformation,
economic aggression, psychological war, constant violations of the
Torrijos-Carter treaties and the threat of military attack.''
   The treaties signed in 1977 by then-presidents Jimmy Carter and
Omar Torrijos cede control of the Panama Canal to Panama at the end
of the century. Noriega has long maintained the United States wants
to renege on the pacts.
   The falling out between Noriega and the United States began last
year when he was indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges. The United States threw its support against the
anti-Noriega movement that has so far failed to budge the strongman.

<HEAD>OAS Gives Panama Mediators More Time; Panama Blames US for Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States gave a team
of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic
transition in Panama but a top Panamanian official said no solution
is possible so long as his country is ``permanently threatened'' by
the United States.
   OAS foreign ministers met Tuesday night to review the situation
in Panama three weeks after they authorized envoys from Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad to try to work out a democratic ``transfer of
power'' in Panama.
   During almost four hours of debate Tuesday night, there was
little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that
goal. Tuesday was their original target date and their new deadline
under the extension is July 19.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter, told reporters after the
session that his government had no intention of moving toward a
solution so long as the United States maintained economic sanctions
and continually threatened Panama with the use of force.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in Panama,'' he said.
   The crisis in Panama grew out of the decision by authorities
there to declare national elections null and void three days after
they were held on May 7.
   International observers claimed that the government committed
fraud on a massive scale, depriving opponents of the
military-dominated government of a 3-1 victory at the polls. Some of
the opposition candidates were brutally beaten.
   With the scrapping of the election returns, a crisis of
legitimacy has been created, which the OAS has been attempting to
address. But with the passing of almost a month since the crisis
reached a peak, some of the hemispheric indignation over the
continued rule of Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
has dissipated.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, the U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, said the OAS must take account of charter
provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy
as a guiding hemispheric principle.
   The OAS must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed Noriega and said that the OAS must consider
``further action'' against Panama if progress toward democracy is
not achieved quickly.
   ``Noriega is the problem,'' he said.
   Sept. 1 has become a ``guidepost'' for the OAS mediators because
that is the day on which the Panamanian constitution says a new
president must take office.
   The current president is Manuel Solis Palma, a Noriega ally, but
the United States recognizes the president ousted 15 months ago by
Noriega's supporters in the National Assembly, Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Ritter recounted what he described as the series of abuses
committed by the United States since Delvalle's ouster. These
include the freezing of Panamanian assets abroad and U.S. refusal to
pay Panama ``a single cent'' on operations relating to the Panama
Canal.
   The United States has contributed to the destruction of Panama's
economy, Ritter said.
   He noted that President Bush authorized the dispatch of an
additional 2,000 U.S. combat troops to Panama last month after the
elections and said one consequence is that the ``civilian population
lives in fear'' of U.S. military attack.
   Ritter did not oppose the extension of the OAS mandate. The only
opposition came from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto,
who said no extension was appropriate without the explicit support
of Panama.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the United States and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on Noriega.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Did Anybody Tell Baker About the OAS Meeting?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Organization of American States foreign
ministers were scouting around last month for a date to meet in
Washington, they settled on July 19, partly because Secretary of
State James A. Baker III would be in town.
   But when the delegates convened here Wednesday to talk about the
Panama situation, Baker was occupied by other matters and stayed
away.
   Other foreign ministers from the hemisphere had traveled up to
6,000 miles to attend the meeting, but Baker didn't make the
five-block trip over to OAS headquarters from the State Department.
   The story was much the same in June. Ministers from around the
hemisphere turned up in Washington for a meeting on Panama, but
Baker had other issues on his agenda and sent subordinates over to
the OAS.
   This does not go unnoticed by other governments, which have the
clear impression Baker is much more oriented toward Europe and Asia
than he is toward Latin America.
   Indeed, just two weeks before Baker was a no-show at OAS
headquarters on Wednesday, he had traveled halfway around the world
to attend a meeting of the six-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in Brunei. The OAS has 31 members.
   Shortly after taking office in January, he took off on a visit
to each of the European members of NATO and has been back to Europe
several times since then.
   Baker's aides acknowledge he may be gravitating toward Europe
and Asia because the economic and political changes there are
generally favorable to the United States, especially in contrast to
Latin America, where the outlook is far bleaker.
   While the democratic trend in Latin America is a source of
encouragement to U.S. officials, the economic situation in many
countries is disastrous and the problem of coping with drug flows
from south of the border seems insurmountable.
   Beyond that, as this week's OAS meeting on Panama demonstrated
once again, Americans and Latin Americans just don't see things the
same way.
   A comparison between that meeting and an OAS meeting on Cuba 25
years ago this week offers convincing evidence of just how far U.S.
influence in the hemisphere has declined over the past generation.
   Prodded by the Johnson administration a quarter-century ago, the
OAS imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic sanctions against
Cuba after concluding that Cuba was responsible for fomenting
subversion in Venezuela.
   Those were the days when anti-communist military dictators
dominated Latin American political life; they were only too willing
to lend strategic support to Washington's Cold War ventures.
   Nowadays, democracy is ascendant in the hemisphere, and the
anti-communist consensus has long since unraveled. The Reagan
administration looked high and low for Latin American support for
the Nicaraguan Contras but almost always came up empty-handed.
   The Bush administration is somewhat isolated on what to do about
the situation in Panama. Gen. Manuel Noriega is not a popular
figure in the hemisphere but only Washington seems to have any
appetite for confronting him.
   The disappointment among U.S. officials was palpable Wednesday
night when the best the OAS could do on Panama was a declaration
which _ although it calls for a transfer of power in Panama _ was
so bland and ambiguous that even Noriega's representative didn't
oppose it.
   That is not the only issue on which the Bush administration has
been isolated politically from its hemispheric neighbors.
   In contrast to the situation 25 years ago when Cuba was
virtually friendless in the hemisphere, President Fidel Castro now
enjoys widespread acceptance. One exception is Washington.
   In less than a year, Castro has attended presidential inaugurals
in Ecuador, Venezuela and Mexico. Much to Washington's chagrin, the
United Nations has selected Cuba as the site for a conference on
crime next year.
   Baker has not ignored hemispheric affairs completely; one early
achievement was the bipartisan agreement he reached with Congress
governing future policy toward Central America.
   In time, he may find hemispheric issues more appealing. One test
will come on Aug. 23, the date of the next OAS foreign ministers'
meeting on Panama.

<HEAD>Military Agrees on Talks to End Political Crisis</HEAD>

   The military has agreed to participate
in talks toward ending the political crisis involving Defense Forces
chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the government said Wednesday.
   The military will be included in the government delegation,
Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said in a letter to Jorge Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States.
   The talks among the government, military and opposition were
proposed last week by an OAS mission, which has made two trips to
Panama since the government annulled a May election that foreign
observers said the opposition won handily. The government had
insisted that Noriega, the country's de facto leader, was ``not
negotiable.'' But Wednesday's Foreign Ministry statement, which
included excerpts from Ritter's letter, made no mention of Noriega.
   Ritter's letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlock
caused by Noriega' insistence the military had nothing to do with
politics. Noriega had said talks to resolve the crisis should be
between the government and the opposition.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma's government reiterates ``its
decision to take part in a dialogue between Panamanians to try
overcome the grave problems confronting'' the nation, Ritter's
letter said.
   The government will be represented by ``the executive branch,
which includes the Defense Forces,'' it added.
   In the letter, Ritter indicated the OAS should help draw up an
agenda for the talks ``on the basis of a concensus among those
taking part ... to serve as a basis for discussion of the Panamanian
nation's problems.''
   Opposition groups demanding that Noriega step down said last week
they were willing to take part in the talks.
   Noriega was indicted in 1988 by federal grand juries in Florida
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Efforts by the
United States to oust him, including economic sanctions against
Panama, have failed.
   Noriega had the legislature, which he controlled, fire President
Eric Arturo Delvalle in February 1988, a day after Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega. The legislature then named Education Minister Solis
Palma acting president, but the U.S. has insisted on recognizing
Delvalle as Panama's legitimate president.
   The crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidate
Carlos Duque of the National Liberation Coalition won the
presidential election May 7.
   Opposition groups and foreign observers including several from
the United States, said there was widespread fraud in the election
and that the opposition candidate, Guillermo Andara of the
Democratic Civilian Alliance, won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   As the crisis grew, a government-controlled election board
annulled the election. The government had planned to install the new
president on Sept. 1.
   The OAS, called in to try solve the crisis, sent a delegation of
top diplomats late in May, then a second one last week, to try and
get the government, the military and the opposition to negotiate.
   The delegation, headed by Baena Soares, included foreign
ministers Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, Mario Palencia of Guatemala and
Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad-Tobago.

   Foreign ministers of the Organization of
American States agreed Tuesday night to give a six-week extension to
a team of mediators assigned to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in Panama.
   The mediators are to report back to the foreign ministers before
July 19.
   Tuesday had been their deadline for a three-week effort to work
out a ``national accord'' in Panama that would lead to a ``transfer
of power in the shortest possible time.'' Their was no indication,
though, that the mediators had made much progress.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto opposed the extension
on grounds that it did not have the explicit support of the
Panamanian government.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter raised no
objection to the proposal, under which the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Costa Rica and Trinidad will undertake a return mission to
Panama in a bid to carry out the OAS mandate.
   The agreement was reached in early evening after closed-door
talks at the Colombian Embassy where delegates spent much of the day
attempting to find common ground.
   After the extension was approved, D'Escoto delivered a lengthy
speech strongly criticizing the United States as an ``imperial
superpower'' which has systematically thwarted the
non-interventionist principles of the OAS.
   U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Lawrence
Eagleburger said the OAS must take account of charter provisions
calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a
guiding hemispheric principle.
   The OAS must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega and
said that the OAS must consider ``further action'' against Panama if
progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly.
   ``Noriega is the problem,'' he said.
   But Ritter maintained that a ``durable solution'' to Panama's
crisis was not possible as long as U.S. troops remain in the country
and the United States does not lift the sanctions it imposed against
Panama 15 months ago.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in Panama,'' he told reporters after the four-hour OAS
meeting, elaborating on an earlier speech he made to the gathering.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the United States and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on Noriega.
   The U.S. delegation, led by Eagleburger, had lobbied during the
closed-door consultations for the mediators to report in 15 days but
settled on six weeks.
   In a report on their initial mission to Panama, the mediators
contended that an extension of their OAS mandate would be ``very
advisable.''
   There was no indication in the report that the mediators came
close to achieving the goals of a resolution approved by the OAS
mission on May 17. Much of the five-page report was devoted to
listing the names of Panamanians with whom the mediators met.
   The May 17 resolution criticized Noriega for the ``grave events
and abuses'' which occurred during and after the May 7 national
elections in Panama.
   Amid widespread allegations of fraud by forces loyal to Noriega,
the government threw out the election returns, creating the crisis
of legitimacy that the OAS has been attempting to resolve. There
also were brutal attacks on some opposition candidates by government
forces.
   One U.S. official said Sept. 1 is being viewed as a ``guidepost''
for the OAS mediators because Panama is scheduled, under its
constitution, to change presidents that day.
   Just who the new president would be is unclear because of the
scrapping of the May 7 election returns.
   Opposition candidate Guillemo Endara is widely believed by
international observers to have won the election. But Noriega's
hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque, also claimed victory.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, an opposition vice presidential candidate
who is in Washington for the OAS meeting, said Tuesday he believes
the OAS should approve a resolution that shows ``respect'' for what
he claimed was the 3-1 margin of victory by the opposition.
   ``We beat the dictator at his own game,'' Arias Calderon said.

NATIONS OF THE HEMISPHERE FIND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY TESTED

Organization of American States, practices law in Washington.

<P>
As the tragic events in Panama move the United States toward a historic 
confrontation, the moment has arrived for the nations of the Americas to act 
through the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
There is no ambiguity about the current issues. Gen. Manuel A. Noriega tried to 
use the instruments of democracy to mock democracy. He failed. His failure has 
been witnessed by the entire world. Exit polls conducted under the auspices of 
the Roman Catholic church have affirmed the will of the Panamanian people in 
favor of the opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara. Two former U.S. 
Presidents, Republican Gerald R. Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter, have confirmed 
the observations of all election observers that a clumsy election fraud was 
perpetrated. The outrageous brutality of last week, attacking the opposition 
leaders and other people with steel rods and iron pipes, demonstrates that the 
Panamanian military, led by Gen. Noriega, is at war with its own people. The 
aggression is as real as the more traditional aggressions by other states, only 
in this case it is by another, more insidious foe, an international drug Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
The nations of the Americas know that the United States has vital national 
interests in Panama. They are real and deeply felt. But it is no longer only 
the Panama Canal. Two other issues give the tragedy its full meaning: drugs and 
democracy. Given the circumstances, President Bush has done well with his 
measured response in order to give the nations of the hemisphere time to accept 
regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Democracies in Latin America are especially vulnerable to armies with guns. 
Unless they show resolve, no democracy is safe. In this case, we are in direct 
confrontation with one of the major drug criminals in the world who holds an 
entire nation hostage. Past Latin American hesitancy to countenance 
intervention in internal matters meets a severe test in the unique 
circumstances in Panama. A coherent hemispheric policy in favor of democracy in 
which all of the nations participate is the best protection that Latin America 
could have against unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
This is the role for the Organization of American States. Unless it stands for 
hemispheric cooperation in defense of freedom and democracy, it stands for 
nothing. The words of its charter couldn't be clearer. "The true significance 
of American solidarity . . . can only mean the consolidation on this continent 
. . . of democratic institutions, of a system of individual liberty and social 
justice based on respect for the essential rights of man . . . The solidarity 
of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require 
the political organization of those States on the basis of representative 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Treaty is equally unequivocal. It states that "the American regional 
community affirms . . . that peace is founded on . . . the international 
recognition and protection of human rights and freedoms . . . and on the 
effectiveness of democracy for the international realization of justice and 
security." It adds that "the obligation of mutual assistance . . . is 
essentially related to their democratic ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular mythology, the nations of the hemisphere have repeatedly 
taken firm action for democracy when faced with blatant abuse of power. Ten 
years ago, through the OAS, they took the courageous step to condemn the 
dictatorship of Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza by clearly asking him to step 
down. They did the same in the case of the military coup in Bolivia a year 
later. Throughout the 1970s, the OAS was the major force to focus attention on 
human rights abuses in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela has recognized in his call 
for hemispheric action, the OAS has been given another chance. All the rules 
and the precedents are in place. It is the nations of the hemisphere that bear 
a heavy responsibility. The OAS is but an euphemism. It is the American 
governments themselves, nothing more, nothing less. The challenge is whether 
they are prepared to deal with serious issues on a multilateral basis. Will 
they move to affirm their commitment to democracy in substance as well as in 
rhetoric? From the Latin American point of view, the United States could not 
have adopted a better stance to give them time to do what they have always 
claimed they were ready to do. 
</P>
<P>
A wide range of measures -- diplomatic, economic and political -- are available 
to help force Noriega from power. It would be difficult for anyone to criticize 
action to fulfill the will of the Panamanian people and place in power the 
president they have honestly elected. In recent years, the people of all the 
nations of the Americas have repeatedly staked their lives to affirm their 
commitment to democracy. The OAS will not get a better second chance.

<HEAD>Panama Opposition Leaders Draw Cheers In Campaign-Style Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's three top opposition leaders
drew cheers from hundreds of workers as they toured a dozen
factories today, rallying supporters in defiance of a government
ban on demonstrations.
   ``We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one by
one,'' said Guillermo Ford, the candidate for second vice president
in the May 7 election.
   The opposition, which international observers say won the
election by a 3-1 margin, has been rallying support in this nation
of 2.5 million to gain recognition of its claimed victory.
   The Organization of American States last week approved a
resolution critical of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as head of
the Panamanian Defense Forces holds real power in Panama, and
called for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Noriega-controlled government nullified the elections. The
opposition has asked the OAS to help reverse that order, and the
organization is sending a delegation to Panama on Tuesday to
investigate.
   Ford; Guillermo Endara, the opposition presidential candidate;
and vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon were greeted
enthusiastically today at each stop in one of Panama's largest
industrial parks.
   Today was the third consecutive day the candidates rallied the
opposition without interference from the government despite its ban
on ``marches, meetings, public demonstrations or caravans of
vehicles.''
   The ban lasts until June 5, when the OAS delegation is due to
report back to the organization's headquarters in Washington.
   On Sunday, the candidates received raucous applause from 1,000
worshipers at a church 20 miles west of Panama City.
   On Saturday, the three made their first campaign-style
appearances since they were assaulted by Noriega's paramilitary
forces on May 10, touring a series of marketplaces in and near the
capital.
   That tour was the opposition's first attempt to rally against
Noriega since Wednesday, when a general strike fizzled.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and
Tobago, along with OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are due
in Panama on Tuesday to try to promote a resolution of the crisis.
   The candidates on Saturday met with U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.
   Murtha, leader of a team of U.S. observers appointed by
President Bush that declared the election fraudulent and Endara the
winner, was in town to visit U.S. troops and confer with officials.
   Murtha issued another in a series of U.S. and opposition signals
to the Panamanian Defense Forces that a coup against Noriega would
be welcome.
   Bush ``is not interested in punishing the PDF,'' Murtha said.
``He is interested in dealing with the PDF. The target of our
dismay is the leader of the PDF.''
   Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United
States in February 1988 but has withstood all efforts by Washington
to have him removed.
   He denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S. plot to
renege on its treaty to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of 1999.

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
was preparing to present new drug charges against Panama at a
special meeting Thursday of the Organization of American States,
U.S. officials said.
   The 31-nation session was set at U.S. request after Panama last
week challenged the Bush administration for evidence of its charges
of drug involvement against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The 18-month unsuccessful U.S. campaign to oust Noriega as the
behind-the-scenes ruler in Panama is getting only lukewarm support
from the hemisphere group.
   The OAS foreign ministers last week adopted a bland statement
expressing concern about the situation in Panama. But the Bush
administration is hoping Eagleburger's response to the challenge
will put more zip in the OAS approach.
   Two Florida grand juries have already indicted Noriega on drug
smuggling charges. This week U.S. officials have hinted to reporters
there is more evidence against him.
   It is not clear how far Eagleburger will go in documenting U.S.
allegations since prosecutors would not want any court case
jeopardized.
   In requesting the meeting, William Price, the acting permanent
U.S. representative, said the United States wanted to present ``a
summary of the evidence and elaboration of the United States
position on the critical situation in Panama.''
   Noriega attorney Raymond Takiff of Miami demanded in a letter to
the OAS the right to cross-examine witnesses who were to appear
before the organization.
   The letter also asked for the ``opportunity to prove ... that the
indictments against General Noriega are motivated politically
representing nothing more than `indictment dipolomacy.'''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, confirmed on
Wednesday that Eagleburger would focus on narcotics, but she
declined to offer any details in order ``not to pre-empt what the
Deputy Secretary will be saying tomorrow.''
   The term of Panama's provisional president, Manuel Solis Palma,
who was hand-picked by Noriega, expires on Thursday. The Bush
administration and Panamanian opponents of the general are concerned
Noriega will name a puppet government and not hold free elections.
   With tempers rising, Eagleburger last week compared Noriega to
Adolf Hitler and derided Panama as an ``outlaw regime'' that
deserves the censure of all OAS states.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter walked out, and in a
vitriolic 2-hour rebuttal, Panamanian delegate Romulo Escobar
Betancourt blamed the United States for lack of progress toward a
political solution.
   ``If you have any evidence to show Gen. Noriega is involved in
drug trafficking, bring it here to the OAS,'' Escobar said.
   In London, the British Foreign office on Wednesday urged Noriega
to step down and ``open the way to a peaceful, democratic resolution
of Panama's problems.''

   One of the State Department's most experienced
Latin America hands is in line to become ambassador to the
Organization of American States as part of an administration effort
to revitalize that institution, according to U.S. officials.
   President Bush is expected to appoint Luigi Einaudi, 52, a
right-hand man to the last six assistant secretaries of state for
inter-American affairs, to the OAS post, succeeding former
Ambassador Richard McCormack. The officials who confirmed Einaudi's
prospective appointment asked not to be identified.
   One of a handful of intellectuals at the State Department,
Einaudi has a doctorate in political science from Harvard and is a
recipient of the highest award in the career public service.
   He was once called by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz
``the State Department's leading expert on U.S.-Latin American
relations.''
   Because of budgetary constraints partly brought on by U.S.
failure to meet its quota commitments, the OAS has been forced to
negotiate early retirement for about 300 of its estimated 1,000
employees over the past several weeks.
   The Bush administration has promised to seek full funding for
the OAS in 1990 and is showing support in other ways.
   As an example, Secretary of State James A. Baker III had a
private meeting recently with OAS Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares. Officials said they could not recall Shultz ever having had
such a meeting during his seven years as secretary of state.
   The administration also has been looking to the OAS to play an
active role in monitoring the political process under way in
Nicaragua that is scheduled to result in national elections next
February.
   A generation ago, the OAS was at the center of political debate
in the hemisphere. It imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic
sanctions against Cuba in 1964 for attempting to promote revolution
in Venezuela. It also was deeply involved in the diplomatic process
that followed the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic the
following year.
   However, the OAS has been at the periphery of events for much of
this decade, playing little or no role in such issues as the
Malvinas-Falklands War of 1982, the Grenada invasion of 1983 and
the conflicts in Central America.
   U.S. officials said Baker envisions a stronger role for the OAS
under Bush as part of a U.S. shift in emphasis toward multi-lateral
diplomacy.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has been drifting away from the
go-it-alone Latin American policies favored by the previous
administration and his cautious approach was underscored in
addressing the crisis in Panama.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker appear to have
concluded that the Reagan administration failed to achieve its
goals in the region because it refused to take into account the
wishes of either the Congress or of hemispheric countries.
   So the emphasis has been on working with both in the hopes of
coming up with more effective policies. A bipartisan agreement with
the Congress already is in place on Nicaragua and Bush consulted
closely with lawmakers this past week after the situation in Panama
became tumultuous.
   Bush said the will of the Panamanian people was thwarted by
``massive fraud'' in the immediate aftermath of Sunday's election
and by the subsequent decision of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
throw out the returns. He also condemned the violence directed at
opposition leaders on Wednesday.
   In support of the American ``commitment to democracy'' in
Panama, Bush announced a seven-step plan the following day which
won plaudits from both the Democratic and Republican leadership of
both houses of Congress.
   But little of what Bush did seemed to pose a threat to Noriega.
Some of the measures will have no effect at all, including the
president's recall of Ambassador Arthur Davis.
   A recall of an ambassador is often used in diplomacy to register
displeasure with the country in question but Davis has had no
contact at all with the Noriega-led government in more than 14
months.
   On Saturday, however, Bush seemed to be trying to turn up the
heat on Noriega by Noriega, saying, ``The Panamanian people should
do everything to get him out of office.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, the president
declined to back away from his words when reporters raised
questions about the strength of his language.
   ``No, I would add no words of caution,'' Bush replied. ``The
will of the people should be implemented.''
   At another point, the president said: ``I would love to see him
out of there, we'd like to see him out. The will of the people
should not be thwarted by this man and his ... thugs.''
   He said he was making the statement to make clear to the
Panamanian people that they still had the affection of the United
States.
   He said sending additional U.S. military personnel into Panama
should not be viewed as outside intervention and said ``we would
have good relations with the Panamanian people and the PDF'' _ the
military _ if Noriega were thrown from office.
   The most controversial measure announced by Bush was the
dispatch of a brigade of American military personnel but he linked
that move to the need to protect American citizens in Panama, not
to promote democracy there.
   No new economic sanctions were announced against Panama. Bush
merely said existing sanctions will continue in force.
   Bush ruled out a more heavy-handed approach, realizing there are
few issues around which Latin Americans rally more quickly than
opposition to U.S. interventionism. Thus, Bush rejected use of
force against Noriega as well as the scrapping of the Panama Canal
treaties.
   There was little support in the administration for a total trade
embargo against Panama. That approach would set back Panama's
economy for years _ damaging U.S. investment in the process _ with
no guarantee Noriega would be forced out,
   Bush appeared to place his strongest hopes for a democratic
outcome in Panama on diplomacy but made it clear the United States
will leave it to other countries to take the lead.
   ``The United States strongly supports, and will cooperate with
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address the
crisis,'' Bush said.
   Less than 24 hours after Bush spoke, the Organization of
American States permanent council convened to take up a Venezuelan
proposal to hold an OAS foreign ministers meeting on the Panama
situation.
   At the conclusion of the two-hour session, the 31 delegates
unanimously approved a meeting for this coming Wednesday. This will
be perhaps the first major test for Bush and Baker's stated
preference for diplomatic approaches.
   In a speech two weeks ago, Baker alluded to the widespread
desire for the United States to forgo unilateral measures but
cautioned alternative approaches may have drawbacks as well.
   ``All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to
the region's conflicts now have a responsibility to prove this is
the best and the surest route to achieve our common goals,'' he
said.
   Privately, U.S. officials are skeptical that the OAS meeting
will conclude with an unambiguous condemnation of Noriega's rule in
Panama.
   Although the OAS charter calls representative democracy ``an
indispensable condition'' for peace in the hemisphere, it also
stresses that the principle of non-intervention must be respected
as well.
   This latter point was emphasized repeatedly during Friday's
permanent council meeting, with countries as diverse as Chile,
Mexico and Nicaragua alluding to it.
   In the days prior to the meeting, U.S. delegates will be
lobbying hard for a resolution which, at a minimum, denounces
Noriega, while other delegates will be attempting to promote as
bland a declaration as possible.
   It is generally agreed that failure by the OAS to confront
Noriega squarely on the events of this past week could lead to a
reassessment of the administration's goal of governing on the basis
of broad consensus rather than unilateral action.

<F P=106> [Report by Rafael Candanedo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Belem, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Cuba's readmission into 
the OAS is no longer viewed as a taboo issue within the 
organization, but its debate will be delayed and may be included 
in the agenda of the OAS general assembly in 1995. 
  The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly -- the 
main 
forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which 
will close on 10 June -- have addressed the possibility of 
readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach, 
although without much enthusiasm. 
  The 24th OAS General Assembly, which is hosted by the city 
of 
Belem, Para State, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim. It is in its final stage and is now being 
attended by second level delegates because most of the 
respective foreign ministers have already returned home. 
  Considering Cuba is the only Latin American country excluded 
from the OAS, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the 
Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be 
included in the agenda of the OAS. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official of one Andean country 
rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and 
yet Cuba continues to be excluded from the Inter-American 
political system, which is regarded as universal and 
pluralistic"? [passage omitted] 
  OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, whose 10-year 
tenure 
will conclude on 20 June when he will be replaced by Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, told reporters that a slight majority 
of OAS member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue." 
  Brazilian President Itamar Franco immediately endorsed the 
initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of Venezuela, 
Costa Rica, Canada, and Bolivia, among others, followed suit. 
[passage omitted] 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo went as far as 
to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate 
among the United States, some Latin American countries, the 
Havana Government, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to 
promote the democratization of Cuba. 
  One South American diplomat said the situation is 
complicated 
because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the 
radical stance of the United States, which does not conceal its 
interest in having President Castro step down. 
  Three positions can be identified among Latin American 
countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by 
Argentina, El Salvador, and other Central American countries; 
second, a current -- which includes the Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with Cuba and 
its readmission into the OAS; and third, a current that respects 
Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the Group of Three 
(Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela). 
  The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the Group 
of Three, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the 
opening toward the Catholic Church, the renovation of the 
Communist Party of Cuba's cadres that has been implemented in 
recent months by Fidel Castro, and the talks held in April by 
Castro's government with opposition groups in exile. 
  Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization, 
which could be jeopardized if Cuba remains isolated. 
  He added: "Perhaps Cuba should make more significant 
gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than 
to slam the door in someone's face."

  [Excerpts] Panama City, 27 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara said here today that, with his 
Colombian colleague Cesar Gaviria in the post of OAS secretary 
general, the organization will wake up and become more dynamic 
for the benefit of all people on the continent. 
  "Under the leadership of President Gaviria, we will have a 
new OAS -- one as dynamic as its new secretary general," Endara 
told NOTIMEX in an interview. Endara added that the people of 
the continent will have "a great servant" in Gaviria, who is 
known for his great abilities and charm. 
  Endara said: "The days of the OAS being a somewhat sleepy 
organization have ended. We will truly see a new OAS. I 
congratulate President Gaviria and offer him Panama's full 
support during his tenure." 
  In the past, Panamanian politicians and journalists have 
criticized the American organization for having maintained "an 
extremely submissive" position toward the regime of General 
Manuel Antonio Noriega. In 1989, the Civic Democratic 
Opposition Alliance (ADOC) asked the OAS to issue a resolution 
condemning the Noriega regime and recognizing Endara's triumph 
in the May general elections; this, however, never occurred. 
[passage omitted on Gaviria's biographical data, background 
material on the OAS election] 
  Although Panama's vote was committed to Niehaus last year, 
Endara said Gavira was a "great candidate" to occupy the post. 
"President Gaviria is very suitable for this post," the 
Panamanian president told NOTIMEX over the telephone from his 
presidential residence, where he is resting today. 
  Endara said he urged Niehaus to not feel discouraged by his 
failure to win the post of OAS secretary general, and he also 
urged him to offer his support to Gaviria. 
  "I hope this defeat will not discourage him from continuing 
his great efforts for the sake of the entire continent," Endara 
added.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares called for 
Cuba's full reinstatement to the OAS during a speech he 
delivered at the inaugural session of the 24th OAS Assembly, 
which began today and concludes Friday in Belem, Brazil. 
  The nineties are not the sixties, Baena Soares said in 
reference to Cuba's suspension from the OAS in 1962, when the 
East-West conflict was raging. He also recalled the efforts he 
made a long time ago in favor of having the measure reexamined. 
  After serving two consecutive mandates for a total of 10 
years as the regional organization's general secretary, Baena 
Soares stressed that during his tenure, peace was restored in 
the Americas, and yet, at the same time, there was growing 
dissatisfaction over persistent difficulties and increasing 
poverty. 
  Baena Soares also spoke of his failed efforts to restore 
Haiti's constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
power, but he admitted the organization had not exhausted every 
peaceful means to try to force the aggressors against democracy 
and against the Haitian people to give up power. The outgoing 
OAS secretary general expressed his resolve to continue 
supporting efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the 
Haitian crisis. 
  Meanwhile, Itamar Franco, president of the host country 
Brazil, addressed the foreign ministers and representatives of 
the OAS' 34 member-countries. He praised Baena Soares' efforts 
and predicted that new Secretary General Cesar Gaviria will also 
derive positive results from equally hard work.

<F P=106> [Interview with OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares by </F>
Carlos Banales Marino, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO correspondent in 
Washington, D.C.; date not given] 
  [Text] [Banales Marino] What are the differences between 
the OAS you encountered 10 years ago and the OAS you are leaving 
now? 
  [Baena Soares] I am very pleased with the fact that I was 
able to be present at the OAS during a period of reaffirmation 
and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an 
organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has 
been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able 
to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to 
cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal 
drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern 
world. All the governments represented at the OAS have been 
elected in free elections and this represents a huge difference 
from the situation 10 years ago. 
  [Banales Marino] Are we entitled to say that the OAS has 
matured as an international organization throughout these 10 
years? 
  [Baena Soares] I believe it has improved. This organization 
was established in 1889. Afterward, our countries met 
periodically until the OAS Charter was voted on in 1948. And 
this may be the date when the OAS was formally established. It 
is not possible to say that an organization established more 
than 100 years ago is not mature. I would prefer to say that 
this was a period of reaffirmation of our organization as a 
mechanism for dialogue among countries in our hemisphere. 
  [Banales Marino] At this moment and with the current OAS 
structure, do you believe the OAS has more mechanisms available 
to improve Latin America's political and social perspectives? 
  [Baena Soares] No doubt. I believe these mechanisms involve 
the three reforms of the OAS Charter and the approval of such a 
new idea as integral development. 
  [Banales Marino] During your tenure as OAS secretary general 
there were a number of crises in Latin America in which the OAS 
became strongly involved. In your opinion, which one was the 
most delicate? 
  [Baena Soares] I believe the entire peace process in Central 
America represented a very significant participation effort by 
our organization. We are involved in various stages of a process 
in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Understandably, this is 
absolutely necessary from a humanitarian viewpoint--in the first 
place--and considering a country's economic interests, job 
openings, and the use of land. 
  When democracy was under attack, we created a favorable 
atmosphere with our participation, but I am aware of the fact 
that the decisions to restore democracy are made by the people. 
It is not the OAS but the people who guarantee democracy. The 
inter-American community, through the OAS, may actually 
cooperate, assist, and create a favorable atmosphere. In Haiti, 
we still have problems. I am used to saying that the mere fact 
that there still are problems is something essential because, if 
you look back, 15 years ago there were people like Duvalier and 
Generals Nanfir and Avril. There was a different reaction, one 
of approval. Now there is one of rejection. Not a single 
American country has recognized the de facto authorities in 
three years. Moreover, there has always been an adverse 
reaction, seeking a solution. What are the roots, the profound 
reasons for this crisis? 
  The links between entrepreneurs and the military are at the 
root of the crisis because the entrepreneurs never accepted the 
elections, never accepted the presence of President Aristide. 
And as long as we do not tackle the cause of an illness, it 
cannot be cured. 
  [Banales Marino] Do you believe the embargo on Haiti, the 
way 
it is currently being implemented, represents a final solution? 
  [Baena Soares] As long as some entrepreneurs are allowed to 
travel abroad, do business, and carry out transactions with 
their foreign accounts, we will be doing something that does not 
directly affect the people responsible. Therefore, I am saying 
that not all our organization's and its member countries' 
resources have been exhausted. Attempts already have been made 
to achieve an agreement. We already have four agreements signed. 
These agreements have not been respected at either the OAS or 
the United Nations. Therefore, solutions may not be invented. In 
my opinion, a military intervention does not represent a 
solution. We must not forget that in the past Haiti was occupied 
for 19 years. Duvalier's period, and not democracy, followed 
this occupation. The consequences of the Duvalier period still 
can be seen. 
  [Banales Marino] What about Cuba? 
  [Baena Soares] Cuba is a country that belongs to this 
hemisphere. The OAS is this hemisphere's international 
organization that may not ignore any situation prevailing in 
this hemisphere. We currently are experiencing many changes in 
the international system. There are transformations that must be 
taken into account. All this represents a clue for discussion of 
this issue. I cannot anticipate the stances to be taken by the 
governments, but I can actually point out that it is necessary 
to hold this discussion. This issue has not been included on the 
OAS General Assembly's agenda but it obviously is present.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has
been out of public view since the May 7 elections and resulting
violence led to international calls for his ouster, appeared before
about 1,000 chanting supporters Thursday.
   But the beaming Defense Forces chief, wearing a white
``guayabera'' tropical shirt and gray pants, did not respond to
calls by the United States and the Organization of American States
for him to give up his control of Panama's government.
   He did not address the gathering. When reporters asked how many
years he could continue in power, he laughed and said, ``That's a
good question.''
   Noriega appeared at a rally called ``In support of the National
Liberation Project'' at the government's Atlapa Convention center.
   ``The people united shall never be defeated!'' and ``Noriega,
for sure, hit the Yankees hard!'' chanted the general's admirers as
he waved.
   The government nullified the presidential elections, which the
opposition and government candidates both claimed to have won,
after Noriega supporters beat up the opposition candidates.
   Official media said Thursday the Organization of American States
has neither the right nor authority to negotiate a change in
Panama's government or Noriega's departure.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the Bush administration is
prepared to urge stepped-up pressure on Noriega if he ignores an
OAS call to give up power.
   The Catholic Church in Panama applauded the OAS call.
   ``This is a great step forward,'' said Panamanian Archbishop
Marcos McGrath. ``I'm gratified that the organization has taken
this seriously and that it is bringing to bear its influence,
counsel, exhortations and, to a certain extent, threats.''
   Also Thursday, Luis Anderson, a member of the nine-member
directorate of the Panama Canal Commission since 1983, resigned to
protest what he said was government brutality and violations of
civil rights.
   In his resignation letter to acting President Manuel Solis
Palma, he condemned ``the actions of your government against
civilians and opposition leaders, whose peaceful protests were met
with savage and bestial use of force.''
   Anderson was the second Panamanian member to resign this year.
The directorate comprises five U.S. citizens and four Panamanians.
   At a special meeting Wednesday night in Washington, the OAS
foreign ministers said power should be transferred through
democratic means in Panama. They left the details to a mediation
team consisting of the foriegn ministers of Guatemala, Ecuador and
Trinidad and Tobago.
   Senior U.S. officials met with Latin American diplomats Thursday
to discuss strategy for dealing with Noriega if he refuses to
cooperate with OAS mediators.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter promised on Wednesday
that his government will cooperate fully with the mediators, but
there was little expectation in Washington that negotiations will
go smoothly.
   Opposition leaders interpreted the OAS resolution as a demand
for the departure of Noriega, who has commanded the 15,000-member
Defense Forces since 1983 and is de facto ruler of Panama.
   ``It is important to note that the resolution speaks of a
transfer of power and that it insists that Noriega must retire,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, opposition candidate for first vice
president in the May 7 election, which the government annulled.
   On the government's Radio Nacional, commentator Rigoberto
Paredes countered that the ministers ``must not come with the
proposal that Noriega leave, because that is an internal Panamanian
affair.''
   He rejected installation of ``a puppet government of the United
States,'' a reference to the opposition coalition, which claims its
candidate Guillermo Endara won the presidential election 3-1.
   Paredes is an influential member of the National Assembly and
former secretary-general of the government Democratic Revolutionary
Party.
   If the foreign ministers visit Panama, he said, their purpose
should be to discuss ``the war of aggression the United States is
waging against us'' and the freeing of Panamanian funds frozen in
U.S. banks since last year.
   Arias Calderon noted that the three-member commission has until
June 6 to file a report. If Noriega does not accept the report, he
said, the stage will be set for more sanctions against Panama by
the United States and other OAS members.
   Those who oppose Noriega in Panama have been unable to keep
sustained pressure on him and U.S. sanctions have not driven him
out. Washington began trying get rid of Noriega after he was
indicted last year on U.S. drug charges he denies.
   The OAS resolution calls for ``full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people.'' Over objections by Panama and
Nicaragua, language was added blaming Noriega by name for ``grave
events and abuses.''
   The government newspaper La Critica implied the resolution only
passed because the United States promised to pay the $51 million it
owes the OAS before the end of 1989.
   Panamanian opposition leaders had hoped the OAS would impose
sanctions amounting to a diplomatic and political quarantine unless
the government recognized the opposition candidates as winners of
the election.
   The government claimed its candidate, Carlos Duque, had a 2-1
lead over Endara when it stopped the vote count May 10 and
nullified the election.

   The government insisted Monday that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega would not step down as Panama's de facto
leader, complicating talks with the opposition on resolving the
nation's political crisis.
   Earlier, government representatives had said they were willing to
listen to a proposal for Noriega's departure. The negotiations began
Sunday under sponsorship of the Organization of American States.
   The discussions mark the first time since the annulled May 7
elections that the opposition has met with representatives of
Noriega, pro-government parties and the executive branch.
   Despite disagreements the groups agreed on an agenda in the talks
mediated by OAS diplomats.
   A government representative said negotiations will resume when
the opposition delegates return from an OAS meeting Wednesday in
Washington.
   The items listed on the agenda by the opposition include the
removal of Noriega as chief of Panama's Defense Forces, defining
what is meant by transfer of power, the elections that international
observers said the opposition won by a 3-1 margin, and human rights
violations.
   Government and military representatives listed as their agenda
items an end to what they called U.S. agression and military threats
against Panama; withdrawal of additional U.S. troops sent to Panama;
the return of Panamanian funds being held by the United States;
strict compliance with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties that provide
for Panama to gain full control over the canal at the end of 1999,
and no U.S. interference in Panama's political affairs.
   ``The main differences are over fundamental issues,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon during a break in the second day of talks.
Calderon was an opposition vice presidential candidate in the May
vote.
   Carlos Duque, the government party candidate, said during the
break: ``Noriega is not negotiable.''
   Before the session began, Duque said government representatives
would consider Noriega's departure but they also want two U.S.
generals to leave and U.S. sanctions to end.
   ``We will bring the evidence to defend Noriega's case,'' Duque
said. ``They can bring it up as we could bring up the departure of
Gen. (Marc) Cisneros and Gen. (Fred) Woerner, and an end to the U.S.
economic aggressions and the withdrawal of the additional U.S.
troops sent to Panama.''
   Woerner heads the Southern Command, which includes all U.S.
military installations in Panama. Cisneros is commander of Army
troops charged with the defense of the Canal.
   Cisneros often is criticized locally for his anti-Noriega
statements and the military maneuvers and exercises his forces
conduct.
   The opposition had refused to take part in talks unless
representatives of the military also took part; Noriega's position
was that the problem was one for politicians to solve and that he
would remain as head of the Defense Forces, come what may.
   The U.S. government also is opposed to Noriega, whom it has
indicted on drug-related charges and accused of domestic repression.
The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama to force
Noriega's ouster and has increased its military forces for
protection of the Panama Canal.
   The meeting was arranged by an OAS mission led by foreign
minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador. Other members of the mission are
OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares of Brazil, Guatemalan
Foreign Minister Mario Palencia, and Sahadeo Basdeo, Foreign
Minister of Trinidad and Tobago.
   The group said it would leave for Washington on Tuesday to submit
a report to the organization the following day.
   While Monday's meeting was in progress, Noriega attended a
session of the State Council, which is studying a proposal for
forming a junta after Sept. 1 when the current government's term
ends.
   As he left the meeting, Noriega was asked about the country's
political situation. He said nothing but reached into the seat of
his car and, smiling, took out a police club and waved it at
journalists.
