<TEXT>     "Very nice braking. This thing moves very, very easily," Ross said as he
zipped up and down the nearly 47 feet of track on a manually operated cart.
"This is the way to travel around the world.";    Said Apt, who joined Ross
aboard the cart to test its capacity: "Boy, this thing glides slick. It really
does.";    They were less impressed with a mechanical cart that they operated
by pumping a handle back and forth. They said the brakes were bad. An electric
cart also was being tested.;    Today's spacewalk into the open bay, which had
been on the agenda all along, was to be more leisurely than the unscheduled
one Sunday.;    The two crew members had to go into space when the 17-ton
Gamma Ray Observatory's antenna couldn't be extended by electronic signals
from the ground. They shook the antenna loose, then got an early start on
today's space-walking activities.;    Flight director Phil Engelauf said
today's space walk would go as planned for about six hours unless the
astronauts become tired and want to go back in early. Only those tests
performed Sunday were dropped from the schedule.;    "But they were pretty
pumped up after yesterday's walk. I expect they'll want to go for six hours,"
Engelauf said today. "It's the astronauts' call.";    A battery on a backup
spacesuit was installed today in Ross' outfit after his battery failed to
recharge properly during the night. There were no problems with Apt's suit.;  
 Ross and Apt went into the shuttle's cargo bay Sunday to extend the
observatory's antenna from its 16 1/2-foot boom, and within minutes Ross had
shaken it loose.;    "It's free, it's free! I can see it move, it's free!" he
shouted.;    "Far out; good work," said Apt.;    It was the first spacewalk by
Americans in more than five years.;    NASA was quick to point out that the
observatory could not have been fixed on the spot if it had been carried aloft
by an unmanned rocket.;    "You saw today the value of manned space flight,"
said NASA flight director Chuck Shaw. "We did a lot of work from the ground,
and we needed the folks on the scene to finish up the job.";    Because Ross
and Apt already were in the cargo bay, NASA decided to have them start early
on some of today's spacewalk tasks.;    They did small tests to measure how
much effort building a space station would take. In one test, Ross lifted Apt
up and down several times and from side to side, while the platform he stood
on measured the force applied.;    The astronauts also cavorted about, doing
cartwheels and head stands.;    "Talk about a view," Apt exulted during the 4
1/2-hour spacewalk.;    "Feel like you're walking on top of the world? Look
what's coming, Jay. Hawaii," Ross said.;    The space station, if approved by
Congress, will be assembled in space and require considerable hands-on efforts
by astronauts.;    Sunday's effort was the second unscheduled walk in NASA
history. Astronauts went outside Discovery in April 1985 to try to switch on
the electrical power to a communications satellite launched from the shuttle,
but they couldn't fix it. A crew trained to do the repairs went up four months
later and fixed it.;    Ross and Apt were ordered outside the cabin after six
efforts from the ground failed to extend the antenna. NASA said a locking pin
on the antenna had properly retracted, and only a shake was required to work
the antenna loose.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Two astronauts made America's first successful emergency spacewalk Sunday from
the shuttle Atlantis, saving a $617 million astronomy observatory by freeing a
stuck antenna.;    The 4 1/2-hour orbital ballet took place 280 miles above
Earth at 17,000 mph, beginning at about 11:40 a.m. PDT Sunday. It was the
first U.S. spacewalk since December 1985 and the second "unplanned" outing
prompted by a crisis.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  EMERGENCY SPACEWALK IS A SUCCESS
IN A FIRST FOR NASA, ATLANTIS CREW FREES
OBSERVATORY'S BALKY ANTENNA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Ross, 43, performed the equivalent of kicking a
tire when he gave a shake to the stuck boom of the high-gain communications
antenna, freeing it to swing out as planned from one end of the massive Gamma
Ray Observatory (GRO).;    The "Jay and Jerry Show," as Mission Control billed
it, resulted from remote cameras aboard the shuttle that provided stunning
live television images of the drama, which at times turned into a happy romp.;
   NASA officials have long argued that this is the advantage of having a
piloted shuttle and that it balances the risks and costs: Humans can cope with
the unexpected in a way that robots cannot. For this reason, they say, the
shuttle is the safest launcher for top-priority payloads of increasing
complexity.;    Ross broke the boom free 19 minutes after he had floated out
of the Atlantis air lock to begin what NASA refers to as EVA (extravehicular
activity). He was assisted during the outing by mission specialist Jay Apt,
41, a physicist.;    Cheers and applause erupted in the two National
Aeronautics and Space Administration control rooms in Houston and Greenbelt,
Md., from relieved engineers and scientists. Shouts of "Far out!" and
"Fantastic!" rang between the astronauts and mission control at Johnson Space
Center in Houston.;    "I'm just thankful there was a man in the loop here,"
said Goddard Space Flight Center's John Hrastar, GRO project manager. GRO's
controllers at Goddard had tried and failed six times to free the balky
high-gain antenna by remote control.;    Unplanned walk;  The astronauts had
not planned to go spacewalking until today, when they are to test a mini-rail
system scheduled for use in constructing the proposed orbital space station in
the late 1990s. Much of that exercise is still on the schedule, but once the
antenna problem was solved, the astronauts performed some of today's
assignments Sunday, trying out hand tools and a rope transport system.;   
Ross was on the team that made the last U.S. spacewalk, in December 1985. The
following month, the Challenger accident grounded the shuttle fleet for more
than two years.;    The only other emergency spacewalk occurred in April 1985,
when shuttle astronauts tried unsuccessfully to flip a switch on a Navy
communications satellite using a jury-rigged "fly swatter" and the robot arm.
The satellite was later retrieved for repairs.;    GRO is designed to
investigate gamma rays, the most energetic and least studied radiation in the
cosmos, with instruments 10 to 50 times more sensitive than their
predecessors.;    Complex maneuvers;  The crew was in the midst of a complex
sequence of maneuvers leading to GRO's deployment in orbit when the antenna
problem was discovered.;    Earlier in the day, mission specialist Linda
Godwin had used the shuttle's robot arm to lift GRO straight up and out of the
payload bay and into position to unfurl its solar panels, accordion fashion,
to a wingspan of 70 feet. At 17 tons, it is the heaviest science satellite the
United States has launched.;    When controllers had no luck extending the
antenna, the astronauts tried moving the orbiter, then tried flexing the robot
arm to shake it loose. Still no luck. The antenna boom was stuck in the cradle
on GRO's underside, where it is stored during launch.;    Data receptor;  The
antenna -- a dish at the end of a 16 1/2-foot boom -- is to transmit and
receive data through a NASA communications satellite, which is to relay it to
Goddard through a station in White Sands, N.M. Although it passed release
tests on the ground, "in space, it takes much less torque to hang you up,"
Hrastar said.;    At 11:40 a.m., as Atlantis passed above the southern tip of
Africa, live TV images from a remote camera mounted in the cargo bay showed
Ross pushing his way out of the air lock like a baby chick hatching.;    As he
floated back along the side of the cargo bay at the end of a tether, Godwin
used the robot arm to move the GRO down where he could reach it.;    Hrastar
said engineers believe a small piece of the boom's insulation had snagged on a
bolt or other protrusion -- "not a super major grab" -- and came loose easily
when Ross shook it.;     DIAGRAM: Karl Tate -- Associated Press; NASA's new

<TEXT>     The Gamma Ray Observatory has been designed to spend two years examining
objects that emit gamma rays, the most powerful form of radiation in the
electromagnetic spectrum. However, scientists expect it to operate for much
longer than its design life -- possibly as long as eight years. Gamma rays can
only be studied from space.;    Atmospheric pressure in the interior of
Atlantis was lowered Saturday from 14.7 pounds per square inch, which is
sea-level pressure, to 10.2 psi to pave the way for a spacewalk if anything
goes wrong during the deployment of the observatory.;    It is necessary to
reduce the pressure inside the vehicle to prevent the astronauts from going
through the bends, similar to what happens to deep-sea divers when they
surface too quickly, after they re-enter the shuttle.;    Even if they do not
have to leave the shuttle today, astronauts Jerry L. Ross, 43, and Jay Apt,
41, will go out Monday to test equipment that could be used later this decade
in the construction of the planned space station Freedom.;    Atlantis has
been enjoying a near-perfect mission since its launch Friday.;    "This has
been a really clean flight," said flight director Chuck Shaw.;    The
astronauts took time to chat with schoolchildren by way of amateur radio
linkups, and they got at least one question that showed that even the very
young can wonder about the meaning of it all.;    "Do you tend to re-evaluate
your life when you look at the Earth?" a young boy asked the shuttle's pilot,
Kenneth Cameron, 41.;    "When you float up here above the Earth in a little
spacecraft and look down at the big spacecraft that we all fly on, it makes us
all think about what our priorities are," Cameron answered.;    The flight is
scheduled to end at 6:34 a.m. PDT Wednesday with a landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in Southern California.;    Atlantis is commanded by Steven R.
Nagel, 44.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     "If we can't, there's a possibility that we'll do" a spacewalk, Davis said.
She said a spacewalk would not be made before Saturday. The flight is
scheduled to last nine days.;    The cargo bay doors must be closed tightly
for the shuttle to safely make the fiery re-entry through the atmosphere. Two
of the astronauts -- Tamara Jernigan and James Bagian -- are trained in
spacewalking in case the doors must be closed manually.;    Loose insulation; 
Television pictures beamed to the ground Wednesday showed that several white
blankets of insulation had come loose in the payload bay. And some
weatherstripping, a long sealing belt, also came loose along the edge of one
of the doors that covers the bay during launch and landing.;    Engineers
still were assessing the situation to see if the doors can be shut tightly by
themselves at the end of the mission.;    Columbia's astronauts began their
second day of experiments inside Spacelab this morning, drawing more blood
from one another as part of NASA's most in-depth biomedical research mission.;
   Four of the seven astronauts didn't have far to go when they woke up. They
slept inside the pressurized laboratory module in the shuttle's cargo bay.;   
"They all thought it was a great place to sleep," shuttle commander Bryan
O'Connor said.;    Television images beamed down from space showed cell
biologist Millie Hughes-Fulford calmly taking blood from F. Andrew Gaffney, a
cardiologist. He offered his left arm casually.;    Less than an hour later,
Bagian, a physician, took more blood from Gaffney. Again, he did not flinch.; 
  M. Rhea Seddon, another physician, told Mission Control today it was taking
a little longer than anticipated to collect the blood samples.;    "It's still
running a little ragged because everything takes longer and people are
scattered and veins are not cooperating. But I think we're getting it all
done," Seddon said.;    Smiling rat;  She also said that the rats aboard the
flight looked good, joking that two of them she checked "looked happy. One was
smiling at us, and the other one was sleeping. They looked real clean and real
nice." In all, there are 29 white rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish on board for
the biomedical research.;    The four men and three women, delayed twice in
two weeks because of faulty equipment, rode into orbit Wednesday after waiting
85 minutes for the weather to improve at Cape Canaveral, Fla.;    Spacelab, a
pressurized laboratory module in the cargo bay, quickly was powered up, and
the four medical specialists on board began taking the first of daily blood
and urine samples and blood pressure readings planned during the nine-day
mission.;    Bill Huffstetler, a NASA scientist at the Marshall Space Flight
Center, said Wednesday that television views of the laboratory showed it was
"as clean as a pin" and suffered no damage during the launch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The 60-foot-long doors must close tightly for the fiery re-entry into the
Earth's atmosphere or the shuttle could burn up. If the doors close properly,
but the loose seal causes a gap, the shuttle could be damaged.;    Engineers
have studied the problem since it was discovered shortly after Wednesday's
launch and are considering sending two of the seven astronauts on board out to
fix it.;    National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers planned to
duplicate the problem today on the shuttle Discovery at Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral, Fla.;    "There are no real concerns that we couldn't
today, right now if we needed to, crush that seal and latch the doors down,"
NASA flight director Randy Stone said Thursday. "But it's always the better
part of valor to analyze things in their entirety.";    Several white blankets
of insulation also came loose in the payload bay, probably at the same time
the seal was loosened, in a rush of trapped cargo bay air into the vacuum of
space.;    If the crew can close the doors tight enough, a spacewalk may not
be necessary. But if need be, astronauts James Bagian and Tamara Jernigan
could take a spacewalk as early as Sunday, Stone said. They would either snap
the seal back in place or snip it off. It should take about 1 1/2 hours.;   
Bagian is part of the four-member research team conducting comprehensive
medical tests in Spacelab, a compartment the size of a small bus stored in the
bay and connected by a tunnel to the shuttle's crew compartment.;    The
astronauts worked in the lab for the third day in a row today, collecting
blood samples from each other and monitoring other bodily functions to
determine the effects of weightlessness on humans. They also moved urine
samples from a Spacelab refrigerator back into a mid-deck refrigerator that
got too warm Thursday night and had to be emptied.;    The mid-deck
refrigerator was back in order this morning, but Bagian said when he opened
the door he was greeted by "a real stench that permeates the whole vehicle."
He said that may be caused by drops of loose urine on the outside of the
sample containers.;    All the urine samples were in good condition despite
the refrigerator problem, NASA said.  </TEXT>

a stuck antenna that threatened the $617 million Gamma Ray Observatory,
Monday's "extra-vehicular activity," as NASA calls it, was sort of a joy
ride.;    Hand over hand over Cuba;  "What a great way to travel," Ross said
as he glided along the rail. The Atlantis was passing 280 miles above Cuba,
traveling at 17,300 miles an hour, as the two astronauts moved back and forth
on their makeshift railroad at about the speed of a brisk walk.;    One of the
three vehicles was a platform that the astronaut hooked his feet in and then
pulled himself manually -- hand over hand -- along the rail. The second looked
a little like a railway push car; the astronaut powered it by pushing a handle
back and forth, cranking a mechanical ratchet drive. The third was powered by
a motor with electricity generated by cranks turned by the astronaut.;    Both
men seemed to prefer the hand-over-hand, manually propelled platform, and
their conclusions largely will determine what system is eventually used, said
former astronaut Robert Overmyer, who is in charge of astronaut systems for
one of the station's prime contractors, McDonnell Douglas.;    The Atlantis,
commanded by Steven R. Nagel, 44, is scheduled to land Wednesday at 7:34 a.m.
PDT at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. The other crew members
are Kenneth D. Cameron, 41, the pilot, and Linda M. Godwin, 38.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Study Concludes Space Station May Require Up To 10 Space Walks A
Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 10 spacewalks a week will be needed to
maintain outside components of the proposed Space Station Freedom
unless there are major design changes, a study says.
   The study, by astronaut Bill Fisher and Johnson Space Center
engineer Charles Price and released Friday, showed that in peak
maintenance years with the present space station design, two
astronauts working together would have to spend up to 6,462 hours a
year in space suits repairing and replacing parts.
   Other years, the maintenance would require fewer space walks,
the study said, but over the 35-year lifetime of the station the
time spent on repair space walks would average about 3,276
astronaut-hours a year. This would amount to 273 two-person space
walks a year, or 5.3 a week.
   Each space walk takes about six hours.
   Fisher and Price said that the number space walks could be
reduced by up to half if more work can be done by robots that could
be controlled from inside the space station or from the ground.
   Simplifying repair tasks and making all parts replaceable by
robots could drop the total annual space walk hours to 507, a
number that Fisher said would be manageable.
   NASA has been criticized by Congress for designing a space
station that would require so much maintenance, so much so that
much of the time of at least two astronauts on board would be spent
on repairs and parts replacement.
   The current plan calls for eight-member crews.
   Richard Kohrs, director of the space station program, said that
design of the station is now undergoing a major review and that
each of the recommendations in the Fisher-Price study will be
evaluated.
   He said changes are being made that will cut down on the weight,
power use and maintenance of the station.
   Reducing the number of space walks, he said, is a major goal.
   ``We're going to build the space station for science research,''
Kohrs said at a news conference Friday. ``If you are spending a
major part of your time on EVA (extra vehicular activity or space
walks), then you are taking that away from science.''
   NASA executives had ordered the space walk study to coincide
with the space station design review. Kohrs said the purpose of the
study was to spot problems so that corrections can be made before
construction of station parts begins.
   Assembly of the space station is expected to begin in about
three years and it is expected to be permanently occupied by 1996.
   The station is expected to cost about $30 billion and last about
35 years. NASA has said the station is critical to the agency's
future plans to explore the moon and to voyage to Mars.
   The Fisher-Price report said that a major problem to overcome is
the number of hours of space walking required to maintain the
station while it is being assembled. The station will be put
together with a series of 18 flights by the space shuttle, and
parts of the station will spend months in orbit before it is
permanently occupied by astronauts.
   During that 30-month assembly period, the report said, there
will be a need for 6,267 hours of maintenance by spacewalking
astronauts. This equals about four two-man spacewalks a week.
   ``All of these would have to be done from the space shuttle,''
said Fisher.
   Another study, started after the Fisher-Price team made a
preliminary report in the spring, concluded with estimates close to
those of Fisher and Price. The study, led by William Simon of the
Johnson Space Center, said, however, that with changes in design,
the spacewalks required to maintain the station could be reduced to
about 485 man-hours a year.

   A new space race is on -- not to Mars, but to determine what the well-dressed astronaut will wear on strolls outside America's future space station. 

   The competition is between two spacesuits: One is the daring and exotic all-aluminum AX-5, which has what is known in space circles as the Tin Man. 
The other is the Zero Pre-breathe Mark 3, fashioned from the latest blend of metal and cloth. 
The Mark 3 is more in the traditional spacesuit image. 

   A restyled suit is necessary because changing space needs make the garb used on the space-shuttle flights as outdated as a Nehru jacket. 
"We need something new," says Hubert Vykukal, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineer who developed the AX-5. 
"Something more like a blue-collar work suit. 
A suit that you just put on and go out and do a job." 

   Spacesuits, which generally are used only for activities outside a spacecraft -- the suits worn inside the craft are called flight suits -- have run into problems in the past. 
When Edward White walked in space in 1965, his suit's cooling system malfunctioned, causing his visor to fog up. 
The beverage sack in Charles Duke's moon suit leaked in 1972, sending drops of orange drink floating around inside his helmet. 
Apollo crew members complained later that year of being unable to scratch their noses while they walked on the moon. 
NASA solved all these problems, the last by putting a strip of Velcro inside the astronauts' helmets so that they could relieve nose itches by simply moving their heads. 

   The goal now is to find the best attire for the space station scheduled to be launched around 1994. 
NASA plans to spend $300 million on the new suits, which will probably weigh 50 to 100 pounds more than the current, 100-pound shuttle suits. 

   Vying to become the Pierre Cardin of orbital haute couture are two NASA engineers: Mr. Vykukal of the agency's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., whose AX-5 is a drastic departure from the mostly soft suits that NASA has used before; and Joseph Kosmo of the Johnson Space Center here, whose Mark 3 has evolved from the agency's shuttle suits. 

   "The one who gets there first gets his name in the history books. 
There is no second place," says James Clougherty, a manager at ILC Dover Inc., a Delaware spacesuit manufacturer that is helping produce the Mark 3 suit. 

   The winner will be decided partly by a swim-off designed to simulate walking in outer space. 
In coming months, at least three astronauts here will take turns donning the AX-5 and being lowered by crane into a pool 25 feet deep. 
While underwater cameras record their movements, they will touch their toes, work in a mock-up of the shuttle's cargo bay and do underwater construction work. 
Early next year, they will do the same thing with the Mark 3. 
The water tests will measure the suits' flexibility and comfort. 

   Both camps agree that NASA needs a new Extravehicular Mobility Unit, known by most earthlings as a spacesuit, for use in Extravehicular Activities, or spacewalks. 
Space-station astronauts will be working in the vacuum of space three or four times a week for a total of 1,000 hours a year. 
"They'll be fixing solar sails, putting out scientific experiments and servicing satellites," says astronaut Sherwood Spring. 

   The new suit should provide greater protection against such potentially deadly hazards as radiation, micrometeoroids and man-made debris. 
"There's a lot of junk out there," notes Mr. Vykukal. 
The new suit also should be easier to maintain than the shuttle suit, which must be overhauled by ground technicians after being used three or four times. 

   Regardless of which suit is developed, certain features probably will be incorporated. 
Any suit, for example, is likely to have a "heads-up display" that would be activated by voice and provide the astronaut with important information, such as the suit's internal temperature, on a one-inch-square TV screen inside the helmet. 
And the suit probably will catch up with the Russians by having a rear hatch for easier donning and doffing. 

   The astronauts will have a big say in deciding which of the newly proposed suits will fly. 
So far, neither suit suits them, and for the same reason. 
NASA, at least for now, is insisting that both suits be designed to work at a pressure of about eight pounds per square inch, twice the pressure used in the current shuttle suits. 
But the astronauts worry that a higher-pressure suit could be as inflexible as an overinflated beach ball. 

   The big advantage of a high-pressure suit is that it would eliminate a time-consuming, cumbersome procedure known as pre-breathing. 
On the shuttle, to avoid getting the "bends," astronauts must either pre-breathe 100% oxygen for 3 1/2 hours before going outside, or lower the pressure of the shuttle for several hours and then breathe oxygen for 40 minutes. 
Either way, "it's rather boring," says James "Ox" van Hoften, a former astronaut who now is the manager of space programs at Bechtel National Inc. 

   The astronauts' worries about a higher-pressure suit center on the gloves, which they fear could swell up stiff as a frozen flounder, even stiffer than the unpopular shuttle gloves. 

   "Hand fatigue could be a real problem," warns astronaut Jerry Ross. 
"Everything in space is hand work. 
The only time you use your feet is to put them in foot restraints to prevent yourself from floating away." 
He and astronaut Spring, in a 1985 spacewalk that demonstrated techniques for space-station construction, ended up with sore and tired hands. 
"I felt like I'd been squeezing a rubber racketball," Mr. Ross recalls. 

   The designers admit they are having a hard time coming up with gloves that will work properly. 
Here at the Johnson Space Center, Mr. Kosmo pulls on a newly designed glove, thrusts it into a small vacuum chamber, and repeatedly opens and closes his hands. 
"We're progressing," he says with a sigh. 
"But it doesn't happen overnight." 

   The future of the space station still isn't certain, and astronauts could find themselves all dressed up with no place to go. 
Nevertheless, the spacesuit race is moving ahead. 
About half of the Johnson center's Mark 3 suit will be made of metal, but the shoulder and knee joints will be fabric. 
That, the suit's creators say, will make their outfit much more comfortable than the Ames center's all-hard suit. 
"Would you rather bump into the inside of a trash can or a balloon?" says ILC's Richard Ellis. 

   But Mr. Vykukal, who has been working on hard suits at Ames for two decades but has never had one fly, says he will use padding to make the inside of his AX-5 more user-friendly. 
Astronaut James Buchli, who has tried it on, says he is pleased by the suit's comfort and mobility. 
Moreover, Mr. Vykukal says a hard suit would be more durable, easier to manufacture and less sensitive to the high pressure than a soft suit. 

   Yet for all the debate about weighty design questions, some decisions come down to a simple question of appearance. 
"You can have something that works perfectly," says Mr. Vykukal, who has given his suit a sleeker, sci-fi look. 
"But if it doesn't look good, nobody will buy it."

to give up on today," Mission Control's Brian Duffy told the crew.;    "We
understand, and I think that's a good decision Brian. Thanks a lot," replied
Steve Nagel, mission commander.;    The astronauts have enough supplies on
board to stay up at least through Friday. High winds were expected again
Thursday at Edwards, and the weather did not look favorable at the Kennedy
Space Center backup site in Florida. Kennedy had not been considered for
today.;    Crosswinds had exceeded NASA's limit of 17.3 mph by nearly double
most of the morning in California.;    NASA previously has had to delay a
shuttle landing for weather reasons, and a wave-off has almost become
routine.;    This morning, NASA re-established contact with a satellite used
to communicate with the shuttle. The space agency lost touch with the
satellite late Tuesday and had to switch to ground stations.;    Atlantis'
five astronauts accomplished their primary task on Sunday, releasing the
17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory. It will circle the Earth for more than two years
in search of gamma rays, the most intense radiation in the universe.;    The
crew also undertook the first American spacewalks in five years -- one an
emergency mission to fix a stuck antenna on the $617 million observatory, the
other to lay groundwork for a $30 billion space station NASA hopes to start
building in 1995.;    On Tuesday, Mission commander Steven Nagel guided
Atlantis to within nine miles of the observatory, after a chase that started
from 95 miles away. After closing in on its quarry, the shuttle zig-zagged
behind it for several hours.;    Nagel used star trackers instead of the more
accurate and sophisticated radar to follow the observatory 280 miles above
Earth. The star-tracking technique would be vital in case radar failed.;   
The satellite trouble today involved a satellite that covers Earth's Eastern
Hemisphere. It relays video and voice signals and other data to the shuttle
and made ground stations obsolete. It was those ground stations that NASA
activated.  </TEXT>

   Here are brief sketches of the five
Discovery crew members:
   Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver is making his second trip into
space as commander of Discovery on its mission to deploy the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Shriver heads a crew of space veterans on the flight. The last
time the National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew a crew
of shuttle veterans was on the first post-Challenger flight, in the
fall of 1988.
   As commander, Shriver is responsible for guiding the shuttle
back to the telescope should a problem occur after it is put in
orbit. Other crew members then would spacewalk to fix the telescope.
   The 45-year-old astronaut first flew into space as pilot of
NASA's first secret shuttle mission for the Pentagon. That January
1985 flight lasted three days.
   The excitement surrounding the long-awaited mission continued to
mount as the launch day neared, Shriver said in a recent interview
at the Johnson Space Center.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' he said.
   ``I think they're (scientists using Hubble) going to make some
discoveries and answer some questions we've got now and probably
raise a lot more than we know about right now.''
   Shriver was born in Jefferson, Iowa, and grew up in Paton, Iowa,
where his parents still live. He graduated from Paton Consolidated
High School.
   He graduated from the Air Force Academy with a bachelor's degree
in aeronautical engineering. He earned a master's degree in
astronautical engineering from Purdue University.
   He attended the Air Force test pilot school at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., and worked on development test and evaluation of the
F-15 fighter aircraft. In 1978, he was selected for astronaut
training.
   He and his wife, Susan, have four children.

   Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., pilot of Discovery, says he
is awed at the prospect of helping deploy a telescope so important
to scientists and the study of the universe.
   ``There's a lot of sentimental attachment to this thing for
me,'' Bolden, a veteran of one previous shuttle mission, said in a
recent interview.
   Bolden noted that although the five Discovery astronauts
actually will put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit, thousands of
people have worked on the project.
   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feel''
when its deployed.
   Bolden, a Vietnam combat veteran, insists he has no unique
skills over other NASA pilots that earned him a seat on the
celebrated flight.
   ``I'm just lucky and thankful to be here,'' Bolden said.
   ``From my standpoint, there's nothing special that I bring other
than my own unique personality, and the ability not to be quite as
serious as you could possibly get on a flight of this magnitude.''
   Bolden, 43, was born in Columbia, S.C., where he graduated from
C.A. Johnson High School.
   He received a bachelor's degree in electrical science from the
U.S. Naval Academy and a master's in systems management from the
University of Southern California. He also is a graduate of the
Navy's test pilot school at Patuxent River, Md.
   While in Southeast Asia, Bolden flew more than 100 missions as
an A-6 attack plane pilot.
   Bolden was selected for astronaut training in 1980. He was a
pilot on his first trip into space _ a January 1986 mission that
was the last shuttle to fly before Challenger exploded shortly
after liftoff.
   He and his wife, Alexis, have two children.

   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use Discovery's 50-foot
robot arm to hoist the Hubble Space Telescope out of the cargo bay
and place it in space.
   As an astrophysicist, Hawley has a special interest in the
telescope. He even went to graduate school with some of the
scientists who will use Hubble once it is in orbit.
   ``It's unquestionably a major step,'' the 38-year-old astronaut
said.
   ``It's not unfair, I think, to speculate that the kind of things
the Hubble telescope may see will be revolutionary in terms of what
we know about the universe.''
   ``We know a lot now, we think,'' he said. ``There are some very
important questions, however, that just have been beyond our grasp
because'' scientists have not been able to see distant areas
clearly.
   Hawley, one of three mission specialists on Discovery, also is
the flight engineer _ the crew member who sits on the flight deck
during ascent and landing to assist the commander and pilot.
   Hawley first flew on a seven-day mission in 1984 in which three
satellites were deployed. His current crew member, Charles Bolden,
also was on board Hawley's second mission, a January 1986 flight
that was the last to fly before the Challenger explosion.
   He was born in Ottawa, Kan., and grew up in Salina, Kan., where
he graduated from Salina High School.
   Hawley received a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy
from the University of Kansas and a doctorate in astronomy and
astrophysics from the University of California.
   Before he was selected for astronaut training in 1978, Hawley
was a postdoctoral research associate in Chile.
   He is married to the former Eileen Keegan.

   Mission Specialist Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain and an
astronaut since 1966, is one of two crew members who would perform
a spacewalk should a problem occur on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   McCandless' first space flight was a February 1984 mission
aboard Challenger. During that flight, he and crew member Robert L.
Stewart pioneered the use of NASA's manned maneuvering unit _ a
backpack device that allows an astronaut walking in space to propel
himself from the shuttle.
   The 52-year-old astronaut is low key about his spacewalking
experience, saying only that ``it's very nice.''
   ``The biggest problem is you do have limited mobility,'' he said.
   McCandless was born in Boston. He moved to California and
graduated from Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in Long Beach. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, earned a master's degree in
electrical engineering from Stanford University and a master's in
business administration from the University of Houston at Clear
Lake in 1987.
   He was a naval aviator who participated in the Cuban blockade in
the 1962 missile crisis.
   McCandless was selected for astronaut training during the Gemini
program, and he was a backup pilot for the first manned Skylab
mission in 1973.
   McCandless and his wife, Bernice, have two grown children. He is
a member of the National Audubon Society and once was president of
the Houston Audubon Society.

   Mission Specialist Kathryn D. Sullivan is the second crew member
designated to walk in space if necessary during the Discovery
mission.
   Sullivan was the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk as she
and fellow crewman David Leetsma demonstrated satellite refueling
techniques in space in 1984. It was her first trip into space.
   The 38-year-old astronaut said she enjoyed her spacewalk, but
she would prefer a problem-free mission to another opportunity to
spacewalk.
   ``I'm there, I'm ready,'' Sullivan said. ``I'm the center
fielder who moves over to cover the right fielder.''
   Sullivan was born in Paterson, N.J. She grew up in Woodland
Hills, Calif., where she graduated from Taft High School. She
earned a bachelor's degree in earth sciences from the University of
California, Santa Cruz, and a doctorate in geology from Dalhousie
University in Halifx, Nova Scotia.
   Before joining NASA in 1978, she concentrated on academic study
and research. Since she came to NASA, her research interests have
included planetary geology.
   In 1985, she became an adjunct professor of geology at Rice
University in Houston.
   Sullivan is a private pilot, rated in powered and glider
aircraft. She is single.

<TEXT>     The sky was cloudy after a morning of rain. The weather made the launch
five minutes late.;    The rockets burned for two minutes and dropped empty
into the Atlantic about 130 miles downrange, where ships were waiting to pick
them up. The 100-ton shuttle reached orbit 6 1/2 minutes later on the thrust
of its three main engines.;    Except for the failure of one of several
thrusters during ascent, a minor problem that was not expected to affect the
flight, "all systems aboard Atlantis appear to be performing exceptionally
well," said Mission Control's Jeff Carr.;    It was the 39th launch of a
shuttle and the first of 1991, after a hiatus of four months. Gone were
worries over tiny cracks in a door-opening mechanism of Atlantis that had
grounded another shuttle. The two doors on the belly of the orbiter shut
tightly after the fuel tank dropped off, Carr said.;    The main event of the
flight, which will last five days, is the release of the Gamma Ray
Observatory. Mission Cmdr. Steve Nagel and his crew of four will place the
spacecraft in a 279-mile-high orbit on Sunday.;    On Monday, astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jay Apt are scheduled to take the first space walk by Americans in
more than five years. They are to spend six hours in the open cargo bay
testing equipment that would be needed to build a space station.;    Also
during the mission, pilot Kenneth Cameron and other astronauts will use a ham
radio to contact schoolchildren and other amateur radio operators around the
world. They also hope to reach cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir.;    The 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory, the heaviest science satellite ever
lifted by a shuttle, will circle the Earth for at least two years in its quest
for gamma rays.;    "The study of gamma rays opens a new window not only to
the universe but to a whole new realm of physical activities," said Charles
Pellerin, director of NASA's astrophysics division.;    "You have the real
possibility of seeing phenomena that have not been observed before and perhaps
have not been imagined before," NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said.;   
The Gamma Ray Observatory, known as GRO, is the second in NASA's series of
Great Observatories. The first is the Hubble Space Telescope, which was placed
in orbit last April to examine visible light from objects billions of years
old.;    While the Hubble does its work in the relatively narrow bands of the
visible spectrum, gathering light that originated billions of years ago, the
GRO operates at the extreme far end -- beyond ultraviolet and X-rays.;    In
that range, it monitors energies ranging from 20,000 to more than 30 billion
electron volts. Gamma rays are born often in cataclysms that flourish in black
holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova explosions.;    The rays do not
penetrate Earth's atmosphere. If they did, the sky would be a flashing,
violent sight.;    Unlike Hubble, the Gamma Ray Observatory has no mirrors. A
shuttle mission is scheduled in 1993 to fix a flaw in Hubble's mirror, which
was not discovered until the telescope was in orbit.;    The $617 million
gamma ray probe consists of four scientific instruments, three of them
Volkswagen-sized. Massive devices are needed to collect the rare, sporadically
occurring gamma rays.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Study Finds More Time Needed for Station Maintenance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal NASA study concludes that
astronauts will have to spend 75 percent more time spacewalking to
maintain the space station than previously thought, a congressman
said Wednesday.
   ``It's going in the wrong direction, not the right direction,''
Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said in a telephone interview.
   Green, the ranking minority member of the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NASA spending, said his staff had seen
some of the same gloomy forecasts as The New York Times, which
published the results in its Wednesday editions.
   NASA has said it will make the document public next week, along
with plans to reduce the number of space walks through design
changes and other means. The agency declined requests to make the
study public immediately.
   The space station's top official, William B. Lenoir, has
maintained that the estimates would be high but that the number
could be cut sharply.
   Green said the maintenance requirements were only one issue. The
other, he said, is the limited amount of electrical power that
appears to be available for microgravity experiments on the station.
   NASA plans initially to have 75 kilowatts of power, of which 45
kilowatts will be needed for housekeeping.
   Green said that if NASA can't bring maintenance under control or
provide enough power to be useful, it might be time to change
designs.
   ``One has to look at the possibility that if the situation
continues to deteriorate in terms of safety and the capacity of the
station, there comes a point where we say, `Hey, this design is not
working' and maybe go back to the design this country had,
Skylab,'' Green said.
   The Skylab program in 1973 and 1974 involved sets of three
astronauts working inside the orbiting laboratory for periods of
28, 56 and 84 days.
   The space station, whose cost has more than tripled from the $8
billion estimate when President Reagan proposed it in 1984, is in
the preliminary design phase. A review late this year will lead to
the start of detailed designs.
   A preliminary report in March by a 12-member team headed by Dr.
William J. Fisher, an astronaut, and Charles R. Price, a robotics
engineer, found the station would need more than 2,200 hours of
maintenance each year, far more than the 130 hours that had been
budgeted.
   The New York Times said the final report expects that more than
3,800 hours of spacewalking time would be needed. To date,
astronauts have logged 400 hours of space walks, each a risky
exercise.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' the newspaper quoted
an unnamed engineer. ``You have to build a different station.''
   Green said the space station would be useful for two major
tasks: learning what happens when humans spend extended time in
space and processing materials in a near-zero gravity environment.
   Congress is considering a request of $2.5 billion for the
station in the next fiscal year. The first elements of the station
are expected to be put into orbit early in 1995, with completion
some 28 flights later in 1999.

<HEADLINE>  COLUMBIA ENDS 'SUPER FLIGHT' WITH LANDING
AT EDWARDS AFB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Congratulations on a super flight," Mission Control's Steve Oswald told
shuttle commander Bryan O'Connor after the orbiter rolled to a stop.;   
Columbia circled the world 146 times and logged 3,779,940 miles during the
journey, which began June 5. In addition to the four men and three women, the
shuttle carried a Spacelab research module, 29 rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish.;
   More than 7,500 people gathered at Edwards for the landing.;    As the
astronauts prepared for landing earlier today, the shuttle's cargo bay doors
closed normally despite loose weatherstripping. The crew successfully latched
the left, then right, door as ground controllers anxiously monitored the
events.;    An emergency spacewalk would have been required if the damaged
seal had prevented the left door from shutting tightly.;    Astronaut James
Bagian watched the closing of the left door from a medical laboratory in the
payload bay. It was vital that the 60-foot doors close tightly; otherwise, the
shuttle could burn up during the fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.;   
Although data was beamed to the ground on whether the problem door closed
properly, Bagian provided extra information by watching from about 25 feet
away. NASA said all the latches on the left door snapped properly. The loose
seal did move into part of one latch as expected, but caused no trouble, NASA
said.;    NASA had been prepared, if necessary, to delay Columbia's landing
until Saturday.;    The astronauts' biggest problem during the flight, aside
from the loose seal, was two overheating refrigerator-freezer units. The crew
had to shuffle precious blood and urine samples from one laboratory freezer to
the other, depending on which worked at the time.;    Both freezers seemed to
be working well today, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.;   
The astronauts wrapped up their research Thursday with more blood collection,
and heart and lung tests. During the mission, the astronauts poked and prodded
each other in a series of experiments to learn more about how weightlessness
affects humans.;    Four astronauts will remain at Edwards a week after
landing for further medical tests. The rats and jellyfish also will be studied
after their return.  </TEXT>

   NASA, in a rare move, advanced the
launch date Saturday for the shuttle Discovery and its prestigious
payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Discovery now is due to lift off April 10, two days earlier than
planned.
   ``The shuttle team is ready to fly. Hubble is one of the most
exciting payloads ever launched aboard the shuttle, and we're
looking forward to the mission,'' said William Lenoir, associate
administrator for space flight for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   The space agency's Flight Readiness Review Board decided to move
up the mission after meeting for two days at Kennedy Space Center.
   NASA said last week technicians needed little of the contingency
time built into Discovery's prelaunch schedule.
   Once deployed by Discovery's astronauts, the Hubble will orbit
380 miles above Earth for 15 years. The telescope will be capable
of looking seven times more deeply into space with greater clarity
and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   Astronomers expect to use it to study stars and galaxies so
distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years.
   NASA occasionally has shifted shuttle launch dates because of
scheduling changes in the months prior to liftoff. But it is the
first time liftoff has been accelerated during orbiter processing.
   In February, Discovery's launch date was changed from April 18
to April 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated.
   The telescope's installation into the orbiter was delayed last
week, however, after small mosquito-like insects called midges
invaded a payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers
feared the bugs might damage the sensitive instrument, the most
expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built.
   Forty midges were trapped, and technicians loaded the
25,000-pound telescope into the shuttle's payload bay Thursday, two
days later than planned.
   Mission specialist Bruce McCandless II, one of Discovery's five
astronauts, helped link electrical connections between Discovery
and Hubble on Friday. He also checked the telescope for sharp edges
that might snag spacesuits in the event of a spacewalk.
   McCandless and mission specialist Kathryn Sullivan are prepared
to step into space should the telescope need to be adjusted or
repaired following deployment. It would be the first American
spacewalk since 1985.
   Technicians planned to test the telescope's systems and
scientific instruments Sunday. They want to ensure remote
communications with the Space Telescope Operations Control Center
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and other
facilities.
   The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who discovered in the 1920s the universe is constantly
expanding, a finding that is the basis for the current Big Bang
theory of the formation of the universe.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Krikalev's Debut on `Discovery' </F>
Was Successful, But the Satellite's Debut was Not"] 
  [Text] The landing of the "Discovery" space shuttle at the 
Canaveral space center at 2050 on 11 February marks the end of 
the first ever flight when U.S. astronauts and a Russian 
cosmonaut have been members of the same crew. Unfortunately, 
the attempts to place the "Wake Shield" satellite in orbit ended 
in failure. Sergey Krikalev was going to work with the 
satellite, which had been carried in the cargo bay. 
  The satellite was to have moved to a distance of 75 km from 
the space shuttle. At that distance, with no microgravitation 
at all and no effect from the station's exhaust gases, there 
would have been an experiment to grow extremely pure 
semiconductor films for new-generation computers. But the 
guidance system of the manipulator, which would have been used 
to move the satellite, turned out to be faulty. 
  This failure is very regrettable, since this faulty 
manipulator will be used to assemble the components of the 
"Alfa" international station when it is created. After many 
attempts the astronauts did manage to obtain seven laminated 
electronic components of reasonable quality in the satellite 
factory, but they were not as fine as had been expected. 
  According to the U.S. specialists, Sergey Krikalev performed 
very well, despite the relative failure of the main experiment. 
Any aberrations in the operation of the vehicle were instantly 
eliminated by our engineer. 
  In a year's time a second Russian cosmonaut -- Colonel 
Vladimir Titov -- will fly in the shuttle. During this flight 
the shuttle will approach our "Mir" station for the first time 
and Titov will perform a spacewalk. A docking between "Mir" and 
the shuttle is planned for spring 1995. Incidentally, this week 
U.S. astronauts Norman Thagard, 51, and Bonnie Dunbar, 45 (wife 
of astronaut Ronald Sega, who was on the "Discovery" flight), 
started training sessions at the Cosmonaut Training Center near 
Moscow. The long flight by a U.S. astronaut on the Russian 
"Mir" station is to begin on 1 March 1995.

The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space 
Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a 
stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 
miles -- high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovery, go for Hubble release," Mission Control told the crew at 12:37 p.m. 
PDT. The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully 
backed away as the telescope, glinting in the sunlight, drifted off on its 
15-year search for new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as 
they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel. Mission 
Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to 
help. But there was a third try, and it was successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been 
deployed," the telescope control center in Maryland said. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have good news," said Dave Drachlis of the Hubble control center. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the 
telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their 
eight-hour charge. 
</P>
<P>
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from 
the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be 
disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and 
entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array 
in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed. 
</P>
<P>
The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed 
380 miles above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to 
the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome. It refused to 
budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot 
length and stopped again. A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Houston, we see motion," Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 4 a.m. PDT when 
he grasped the Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and 
carefully hoisted the 12 1/2-ton telescope high above the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery was 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever 
flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the 
Earth's distorting atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer -- 
something to the effect that the big marble (Earth) sure looks far away today," 
Shriver said of Hawley.

   Ground controllers at the Goddard
Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main
antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying
for more than six hours to lock on.
   Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,
as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was
solved.
   ``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
   Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were
working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing
either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications
satellite that acts as a switchboard.
   In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the
antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2
degrees to 10.8 degrees.
   The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit
information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,
were working well.
   Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy
certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space
walkers would have been summoned.
   The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of
storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing
experiments.
   Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of
the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and
was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and
lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
   The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers
attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain
antennas through the TDRS.
   ``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a
Goddard spokesman. ``It's a new spacecraft and we think
inexperience dealing with it was the cause.''
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
   Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
   ``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
   ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
   After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
   ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
   Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
   Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is
operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
   The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Data will follow in a month or two.
   If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
   Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
   On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
   One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
   But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
   By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
   Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
   The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
   Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's transition from a communist
to private enterprise economy will be swift and thorough in order
to avoid the ``halfway'' reforms that are causing economic chaos in
the Soviet Union, the Czech finance minister said Thursday.
   ``Partial reform of a distorted economy ... is much worse than a
non-reform,'' and delays to prepare a comprehensive blueprint mean
``postponing it to eternity,'' Minister Vaclav Klaus said.
   Such a cautious approach ``leads very soon to chaotic
disintegration of the economy, as we see in the Soviet economy just
now,'' Klaus added in a speech to the World Bank's second annual
conferening the problem to see what was
wrong.
   ``Either we are getting the wrong information to make our
calculations or we are making a mistake somewhere procedurally,''
he said. ``We are just going to have to slowly and systematically
work through that before we decide what is wrong.''
   Originally, officials had said the second outage also lasted
about 45 minutes. But four hours later, the center still had not
communicated with the high gain antennas, which are the primary
communications links to relay science data to the ground during
normal operations, Elliott said. There was contact with the
telescope's low gain antennas which can be used in emergencies.
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute

   The solar panels on the secret spy satellite
launched by the shuttle Atlantis failed to swing open the first time
ground controllers commanded them to, and Air Force officials
briefly feared the mission might fail, an industry magazine reports.
   But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if
necessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and the
satellite was successfully deployed high over the Soviet Union,
Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology reported in its Dec. 12 issue.
   The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the
satellite's batteries.
   The magazine, citing Defense Department sources, said deployment
of the $500 million Martin Marietta radar satellite took place on
the shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was
launched at 9:30 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 2.
   After the astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to release the
satellite, they kept their spaceship close enough to watch the
deployment, and were able to visually confirm when it was fully open
to its 150-foot span.
   Had it not, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr.
William M. Shepherd were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair or
retrieve the satellite.
   The magazine said Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson first maneuvered
the shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the Lacrosse, then to
about 5 miles away, then further at 5-mile increments.
   These maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateur
astronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by Ted
Molczan of Toronto, Canada, according to the magazine.
   It said the astronomers observed close-formation flight between
the Atlantis and the Lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits. By
Dec. 6, just before the shuttle returned to Earth, members of the
group in Australia observed the Lacrosse about 180 miles from
Atlantis, the magazine said.
   The mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight, and
neither NASA nor the Air Force released any information about its
purpose. However it was widely reported _ even by the official
Soviet news agency Tass _ that the Lacrosse was being deployed to
observe Soviet and Eastern European military operations through
darkness or cloud cover.
   Such information would be valuable for verifying Soviet arms
compliance. The satellite would also serve as a ``radar eye'' for
the new B-2 stealth bomber.

<HEAD>Cost of Space-Station Maintenance Reportedly Sky High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new NASA report concludes that the planned $37
billion space station will require nearly 75 percent more
maintenance than earlier predicted, a newspaper reported today.
   The conclusion prompted the space agency to set up a special
team to search for ways to reduce maintenance of the 500-foot-long
station, The New York Times said.
   The newspaper quoted NASA engineers it did not identify by name
as saying the station, intended as a centerpiece for study of the
solar system by spacewalking astronauts, must be redesigned.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' one of the engineers
was quoted as saying. ``You have to build a different station.''
   He said political pressure was on to downplay the problem.
   ``There's a lot of pressure to make this problem not a
problem,'' he said.
   Neither the new maintenance estimate from an earlier team of
experts nor the result of the search for solutions has been made
public. Both may be released next week, the newspaper said.
   The space station would need more than 3,800 hours of
maintenance by astronauts each year, the newspaper said.
Preliminary findings in March by the earlier team said the station
would require about 2,200 hours of maintenance each year.
   The special team was put together in June at Johnson Space
Center in Houston to mount a crash search for design changes and
other possible solutions, but some on that team expressed doubt
Tuesday that significant progress can be made.
   ``The numbers suggest the station cannot be built,'' the Times
quoted a Johnson Space Center engineer as saying.
   The space agency hoped to begin building the station in the
mid-1990s. The station would have a life span of 30 years.
   Billie A. Deason, a Johnson Space Center spokeswoman, said NASA
will have no comment on either the new maintenance estimate or the
search for solutions until all findings are made public.
   NASA already is under fire for a serious defect in the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope, hobbled by a mirror defect, and
fuel leaks that have grounded the $25 billion space shuttle fleet.
   Possible solutions to the space station maintenance problem
include improvements to increase the lifetimes of parts, combining
several repair tasks at one time and having advanced robots make
repairs.

<LEADPARA>  Space shuttle Columbia glided through a clear sky and returned home with seven

runway at 8:39 a.m. PDT, heralded by the customary twin sonic booms.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COLUMBIA ENDS 'SUPER FLIGHT' WITH LANDING
AT EDWARDS AFB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Congratulations on a super flight," Mission Control's Steve Oswald told
shuttle commander Bryan O'Connor after the orbiter rolled to a stop.;   
Columbia circled the world 146 times and logged 3,779,940 miles during the
journey, which began June 5. In addition to the four men and three women, the
shuttle carried 29 rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish.;    More than 7,500 people
gathered at Edwards for the landing.;    Earlier today, the shuttle's cargo
bay doors closed normally in preparation for landing, despite loose
weatherstripping. The crew successfully latched the left, then right, door as
ground controllers anxiously monitored the events.;    An emergency spacewalk
would have been required if the damaged seal had prevented the left door from
shutting tightly. The rubber weatherstripping was fine on the right side.;   
Astronaut James Bagian watched the closing of the left door from a medical
laboratory in the payload bay. It was vital that the 60-foot-long doors close
tightly; otherwise, the shuttle could burn up during the fiery re-entry into
the atmosphere.;    Although data was beamed to the ground on whether the
problem door closed properly, Bagian provided extra information by watching
from about 25 feet away. NASA said all the latches on the left door snapped
properly. The loose seal did move into part of one latch as expected, but
caused no trouble, NASA said.;    NASA had been prepared, if necessary, to
delay Columbia's landing until Saturday and have two astronauts go outside to
fix the seal. Officials had considered that unlikely.;    The astronauts'
biggest problem during the flight, aside from the loose seal, was two
overheating refrigerator-freezer units. The crew had to shuffle precious blood
and urine samples from one laboratory freezer to the other, depending on which
worked at the time.;    Both freezers seemed to be working well today, said
Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.;    The astronauts wrapped up
their research Thursday with more blood collection, and heart and lung tests.
During the mission, the astronauts poked and prodded each other in a series of
experiments to learn more about how weightlessness affects humans.;    Four
astronauts will remain at Edwards a week after landing for further medical
tests. The rats and jellyfish also will be studied after their return.  </TEXT>

   In ``hush-hush'' surroundings,
Kennedy Space Center workers are readying the shuttle Atlantis for
launch on Thursday with five astronauts and a Defense Department
satellite set to spy on the Soviet Union.
   The secrecy contrasts markedly with the Discovery flight earlier
this fall, which was heavily publicized by NASA every step of the
way as the nation's return to space following the Challenger
disaster.
   Hundreds of thousands of spectators watched Discovery take off
and land, but Atlantis will be off-limits to the public. Personnel
working on Atlantis are cautioned not to talk about mission details
with wives, husbands, friends, unauthorized persons or, especially,
reporters.
   Only those with special clearance are allowed to work around the
payload, which was transported to the launch pad in darkness and
loaded in the shuttle's cargo bay two weeks ago.
   When the countdown starts, the launch team will be in a control
center secured against unauthorized entry or electronic
eavesdropping on computers and radio transmissions.
   The Pentagon would like to keep the launch and entire flight a
deep secret. But, realizing it can't do that with a program as
visible as the shuttle, it has agreed to release some information.
   It has allowed NASA, for instance, to report the countdown will
start Monday and that launch of the second post-Challenger shuttle
flight will occur Thursday between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. The
precise time will be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff.
   Sources report the launch is set for about 7 a.m.
   Once Atlantis is safely in orbit, there will be a brief statement
reporting everything is fine. Then there will be a news blackout
until NASA gives notice that the shuttle will land in 24 hours at
Edwards Air Force Base in California. The mission is expected to
last three or four days.
   The silence will be broken only if the astronauts experience a
serious spacecraft problem.
   The flight will be directed from another secure control center at
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, with certain military
aspects controlled from an Air Force facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Communications between spacecraft and ground will be encrypted.
   This will be the 27th shuttle flight and the third dedicated
solely to military purposes. Both the earlier military flights were
flown in 1985. The Defense Department claims the secrecy makes it
more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships sitting off Cape
Canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics contend such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets,
with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a
great deal about the upcoming mission. And once Atlantis' satellite
is in its own orbit, they say the Russians will be able to track it
precisely and know exactly what it is doing.
   Indeed, much already has leaked out and been published about the
satellite. Sources report it is to circle the globe in an orbit that
will fly over 80 percent of the Soviet Union. There it will gather
detailed radar images and other intelligence data, much of it aimed
at helping U.S. intelligence officials verify Soviet compliance with
arms control treaties.
   The sources say the satellite has an antenna that will spread out
150 feet and that it cost about $500 million, making it one of the
most expensive satellites ever built.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority. It is
believed the astronauts will test a special optical device that
resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The Air Force has been planning several experiments for upcoming
shuttle flights to determine how useful astronauts can be for
strategic reconnaissance, surveillance of Soviet naval forces and
other operational military objectives.
   The tests will be coordinated with ground exercises, including
troop maneuvers, naval movements and ballistic missile launches. The
military is not disclosing which of the exercises will be conducted
on the upcoming flight.
   All five crew members are military officers. Navy Cmdr. Robert L.
Gibson is the commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner is the
pilot and the mission specialists are Air Force Col. Richard M.
Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   Gibson, Mullane and Ross flew on earlier shuttle missions.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for the second
day, Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm which
is to lift the cargo out of the payload bay. Shepherd and Ross
reportedly will be suited up in the shuttle airlock, prepared to
make a spacewalk if there is a problem with the deployment.
   Gibson and Gardner also will be busy checking out more than 200
modifications made to the orbiter to improve safety and reliability
as a result of the Challenger explosion that killed the crew of
seven on Jan. 28, 1986.
   These changes also were made to Discovery, which was launched
Sept. 29, ending a 32-month interruption in the program that
followed Challenger.
   NASA and the astronauts who piloted Discovery reported that,
except for a few minor problems, the ship flew flawlessly.

   Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, a veteran of one previous
shuttle mission, said he is looking forward to working as ``a real
astronomer'' in space during the Columbia mission.
   ``We get to be astronomers. It really is a great mission,''
Hoffman said in an interview earlier this year.
   Hoffman, 46, flew on a 1985 mission during which he made an
emergency spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue a
malfunctioning satellite.
   While his main duty during the Columbia flight is to help
operate the Astro observatory, Hoffman also is trained to perform a
spacewalk if needed during the mission.
   ``We're not planning to do it, but if it happens, we're ready,''
he said.
   Hoffman already has plans to go into space again on a shuttle
mission scheduled for September 1991.
   He grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. He earned a bachelor's in
astronomy, graduating with highest honors from Amherst College.
   Hoffman earned a doctorate in astrophysics from Harvard in 1971
and a masters' degree in materials science from Rice University in
1988.
   Before he was selected as an astronaut in 1978, Hoffman worked
on several scientific assignments involving research on X-ray data
from several satellites.
   He is married and has two children.

   Ronald A. Parise is one of two payload specialists specifically
assigned to the flight to help operate the Astro observatory.
   Parise and Samuel Durrance are the first non-space agency
shuttle passengers since the 1986 Challenger explosion. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion, including teacher Christa
McAuliffe and Hughes Aircraft engineer Gregory Jarvis.
   ``I'm ready to go. I've been ready for a long time,'' Parise
said in an interview.
   Parise has spent a decade designing and developing the
ultraviolet imaging telescope, one of the Astro instruments, and
said that 10 years of work ``seems like a long time, but it's
certainly gone fast.''
   Payload specialists are not members of NASA's astronaut corps
but undergo extensive training for a shuttle flight.
   Parise, 39, was born in Warren, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's in
physics from Youngstown State University in Ohio. He also earned a
master's and a doctorate in astronomy from the University of
Florida.
   Parise is a senior scientist in the space observatories
department at Computer Sciences Corp. in Silver Spring, Md.
   He is married and has two children.

   Samuel Durrance, the second payload specialist aboard the
flight, waited years to fly into space but was nearly scrapped from
the Columbia crew earlier this year.
   Durrance, 47, an astronomer and research scientist at Johns
Hopkins University, was cleared for flight aboard Columbia in June
following a health evaluation.
   NASA said Durrance is ``medically qualified'' to take part in
the mission, but the space agency has declined to elaborate on the
problem that almost kept him from flying.
   Durrance said he started working on the Astro project in 1982
and was finally picked to fly on a shuttle mission to operate the
observatory two years later.
   ``My feelings about the Astro are great. I've been working on it
for a long time,'' he said.
   Durrance grew up in Tampa, Fla., and earned a bachelor of
science degree and a master's in physics from California State
University. He later earned a doctorate in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   But he hasn't always had his sights set on the stars.
   Durrance, who built race cars when he was a teen-ager, said he
didn't really become interested in the space program until the
Apollo missions. He decided to pursue a career in science, although
he didn't really aspire to become an astronaut.
   At Johns Hopkins, he is assistant project scientist for the
Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, which is part of the Astro
observatory. His main interests are in the origin and evolution of
planets.
   He is married and has two children.

FUEL LEAK PROMPTS NASA TO SCRUB LAUNCH OF SHUTTLE; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: ENGINEERS NOTICE THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY BEGIN PUMPING LIQUID HYDROGEN 
INTO COLUMBIA. A NEW LIFTOFF TIME COULD BE ANNOUNCED TODAY.

The launch of the space shuttle Columbia was scrubbed Tuesday when liquid 
hydrogen began leaking into the craft's engine compartment shortly after 
engineers started pumping the highly explosive fuel into the shuttle's main 
tank in preparation for a night launch. 
</P>
<P>
The launch, already two weeks behind schedule, was postponed for at least 24 
hours, but it probably will be delayed longer than that because it could take 
some time for engineers to determine the cause of the leakage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although liquid hydrogen is explosive when it comes into contact with liquid 
oxygen -- the other component in the shuttle's main fuel system -- engineers 
insisted Tuesday that the vehicle was not in danger of exploding because the 
problem was detected when only a trace amount of vapor was found in the engine 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
"They shut it down to be safe," said Patricia Phillips, a spokeswoman for the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "You simply cannot have excess 
hydrogen in what amounts to a controlled explosion at liftoff." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers were to work through the night to try to determine the nature of the 
problem, and a new launch date was expected to be announced sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
The launch had been set for 9:38 p.m. PDT. The 10-day mission is the first to 
be devoted to a single scientific discipline. The crew had not boarded Columbia 
when the launch was scrubbed at 3:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Manned by seven astronauts, the largest crew since the January, 1986, 
Challenger explosion, Columbia will be carrying the Astro observatory: three 
ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope that will photograph the 
universe at wavelengths normally obscured by the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will operate the four telescopes around the clock for nine days, 
and perhaps 10 if their maneuvering fuel holds out, before packing them up and 
bringing them home for reuse on a later shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of their mission, the astronauts are scheduled to make as many 
as 300 separate observations of objects ranging from Comet Austin, which last 
week made its closest approach to Earth, to quasars at the edge of the universe 
-- and all at wavelengths that, because they are absorbed by the atmosphere, 
have rarely been studied by astronomers in the past. 
</P>
<P>
On this fourth shuttle mission of 1990 and the 36th overall, the astronauts 
also will conduct an astronomy lesson from space for high school students, and 
payload specialist Ronald A. Parise will use a ham radio to attempt to make 
contact with cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
The two spacecraft will have to be within 2,400 miles of each other for Parise 
to make contact. If the attempt is successful, it will mark the first time that 
astronauts and cosmonauts have had a direct radio link. In the historic 1975 
Apollo-Soyuz linkup, all communications between the two craft were handled 
through ground communications centers. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia commander Vance D. Brand, who was a crew member on that linkup, has 
been brushing up on his Russian for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Brand, 58, a former aviator in the Marine Corps, will be making his fourth 
space flight. In addition to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, he was commander of the 
fifth shuttle mission in 1982, which was the first to launch a commercial 
satellite, and commander of a 1984 mission. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Guy S. Gardner, 42, is an Air Force officer who flew 177 combat missions 
in Southeast Asia in 1972 before becoming a test pilot instructor. This will be 
his second shuttle flight; he was pilot of a Defense Department mission in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist John M. (Mike) Lounge, 43, is chief of the Space Station 
Support Office, which is designing the Freedom space station. He will be making 
his third shuttle flight. He was a mission specialist on an August, 1985, 
flight in which an Australian communications satellite was launched and an 
American satellite repaired. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining four crew members all have doctorates in astronomy or 
astrophysics. 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, 45, will be making his second flight. In 
April, 1985, he made the first unscheduled spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt 
to rescue the malfunctioning Syncom IV-3 communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 53, also will be making his second flight. A Caltech graduate, he 
worked on the first Spacelab mission in November, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Parise, 38, and Samuel T. Durrance, 46, will be the first non-astronauts to fly 
on the shuttle since the Challenger accident. Parise is an employee of Computer 
Sciences Corp. of Silver Spring, Md. Durrance is a faculty member at Johns 
Hopkins University in Baltimore.

<TEXT>     Bagian had left an unopened deck of cards at Mission Control before leaving
Earth last week and took another deck with him.;    Aided by his "lovely
assistant," pilot Sidney Gutierrez, Bagian talked Mission Control communicator
Marsha Ivins through the trick. She opened the deck in view of TV cameras,
shuffled the cards and put the pile on a console.;    "We knew that when we
came on this mission that when you get to fly at five miles a second, you get
a certain prescience, and you can tell the future," Bagian said.;    Bagian
said that before blastoff he picked a card out of his deck and placed it in
the opposite direction. He said it would match the one selected at Mission
Control.;    Ivins picked the four of spades.;    Bagian then displayed his
deck to show one card facing down. Gutierrez pulled it from the deck and
slowly flipped it over -- the four of spades.;    "A big round of applause!
That's truly incredible!" Ivins exclaimed. "Amazing.";    "It's hard to do a
trick like this, this far out," Bagian said. "For me, this was kind of a
do-or-die situation.";    The seven astronauts today began a sixth day of
orbital experiments to help scientists understand the effects of
weightlessness on the body. Shuttle commander Bryan O'Connor said his crew has
been working "awful hard" and could use a break Tuesday.;    "Give us a chance
to do some of the color TV stuff (Earth observations) that got deleted and
look out the windows and see their hometowns and enjoy being in space a little
bit," O'Connor told Mission Control.;    Later, after putting in two hours of
work, the astronauts conducted a brief television interview. O'Connor said he
and his crew agree with NASA's decision not to perform a spacewalk to fix a
loose seal on the cargo bay doors.;    O'Connor initially expressed concern
Saturday about the plan. He was more satisfied after analyzing test results
that showed the seal would not prevent the doors from closing tightly for the
fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.;    "Everybody was worried when we first
saw that seal," O'Connor said. "We needed to talk some more about it because
not being able to sit in on all the reviews and look at all the test data and
so on, we wanted to be sure we understood all the assumptions that went into
the decision.";    "But we're all in sync," he said. "We're happy with the
program we've got ahead.";    Columbia's nine-day mission is scheduled to end
Friday, but the flight could be extended a day if the doors don't shut
properly. Bagian and Tamara Jernigan would go into space to fix it.  </TEXT>

   NASA launched the space shuttle for
the first time nearly 10 years ago. Thirty-six flights have
followed, with another one - the 38th - planned for December.
   As of the end of November, 120 people had flown on the shuttle,
some of them several times. Seven were killed. One of four orbiters
was destroyed.
   Here are some of the highlights of America's shuttle program:
   April 12, 1981 - Columbia blasts off on the first shuttle
flight, putting Americans back in space after six years. The
mission lasted 54 hours.
   Nov. 12, 1981 - Columbia returns to space as the first reusable
spaceship.
   Nov. 11, 1982 - Columbia carries two communications satellites
into orbit, the first time a manned spaceship has a commercial
cargo.
   June 18, 1983 - Sally Ride becomes the first American woman to
fly in space.
   Aug. 30, 1983 - Guion Bluford Jr. becomes the first black to fly
in space.
   Nov. 28, 1983 - The first non-astronauts go into space, one of
them the first foreigner launched in a U.S. spaceship. It is also
the first Spacelab mission.
   Feb. 7, 1984 - Bruce McCandless II becomes the first person to
fly free in space, without being tethered to a craft. Two hours
later, Robert Stewart becomes the second.
   April 10, 1984 - George Nelson and James van Hoften perform the
first satellite repair in orbit, replacing a failed control system
and bad electronics box on the Solar Max spacecraft.
   Nov. 8, 1984 - Discovery lifts off on the first satellite
retrieval mission. Two communications spacecraft are snared from
orbit and returned to Earth.
   April 12, 1985 - The first politician, U.S. Sen. Jake Garn,
flies in space.
   July 29, 1985 - One of Challenger's three main engines shuts
down 5 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, forcing an
abort-to-orbit, in which a shuttle is sent into a lower orbit than
planned. It is the first in-flight engine cutoff.
   Nov. 29, 1985 - The first construction work is performed in
space. Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring assemble and disassemble a
beam and pyramid to test techniques being developed for building a
space station. They perform a similar spacewalking demonstration
two days later.
   Jan. 28, 1986 - Challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight,
killing all seven aboard. It is America's second space tragedy. The
1967 Apollo spacecraft fire, which killed three, was the first.
   Sept. 29, 1988 - America returns to space as Discovery blasts
off with five astronauts.
   May 4, 1989 - The first planetary probe - Venus-bound Magellan -
is launched from a shuttle.
   April 25, 1990 - The Hubble Space Telescope is deployed from
Discovery. NASA calls the orbiting observatory the greatest advance
in astronomy since Galileo's telescope.
   May 29, 1990 - Columbia's countdown is halted six hours before
liftoff when hydrogen fuel leaks from the shuttle.
   June 29, 1990 - Atlantis also is found to have hydrogen leaks,
and NASA temporarily grounds the entire fleet.
   Oct. 6, 1990 - Discovery lifts off with a sun probe, ending a
5{-month grounding that is the second-longest in shuttle history.

   After seven years of frustrating
delay, the Hubble Space Telescope is finally tucked away aboard the
shuttle Discovery, ready to embark on its mission to scour the
outermost depths of space.
   The $1.5 billion observatory represents an astronomical advance
of astronomical proportions _ the greatest, in fact, since the
first use of a telescope by Galileo in 1609.
   ``We know a lot now, we think. Perhaps we don't know anything.
Perhaps we'll learn that,'' said astronaut-astronomer Steven A.
Hawley, part of the five-member crew that is set to launch
Discovery on Tuesday.
   Among the mysteries that Hubble might help explain are quasars,
pulsars and black holes, as well as the precise origin of the
universe and the possible existence of other solar systems and life
forms.
   But the telescope's most extraordinary find during its 15-year
odyssey likely will be one not yet envisioned, said Eric Chaisson,
senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
   ``The history of science has shown the greatest discoveries are
those the human imagination has not even conceived,'' he said. ``We
are going to demand that the Hubble look into regions of total
darkness, to look where nobody has ever looked, hoping by design to
discover the unexpected.''
   From its perch 380 miles high, the Hubble will be free of
atmospheric distortion and therefore able to detect light of all
wavelengths, including ultraviolet. The telescope will be capable
of discerning objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best observatory on Earth.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their
light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   The universe is believed to have been created 15 billion or so
years ago by a terrific explosion known as the Big Bang. That
theory is based on the discovery by the late American astronomer
Edwin P. Hubble that the universe constantly is expanding.
   The shuttle mission that will put the observatory named for that
pioneer into orbit has been eagerly awaited by NASA and scientists
around the world for more than a decade.
   The Hubble Space Telescope originally was scheduled for launch
in 1983, five years after receiving government funding. Technical
problems postponed liftoff for several years, and the mission was
delayed to 1989 by the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Concern over Discovery's solid rocket boosters pushed the
mission back yet again to mid-April so the booster's lower right
segment could be replaced.
   Minor problems continued to crop up, such as the discovery that
several dozen midges, tiny mosquito-like insects, had invaded a
payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers feared the
bugs might damage the 24,250-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, and
installation was postponed while the midges were rounded up.
   Later, a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment and
knocked out air conditioning. Some heat-sensitive computers were
shut down, temporarily interrupting testing of the telescope's
scientific instruments.
   ``Every new problem makes you a little uptight. But we've
survived,'' said Bill Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer.
   Until the telescope arrived at Kennedy Space Center last
October, engineers had taken advantage of the numerous delays to
upgrade the instrument and make it easier to care for in space.
   The telescope, at $1.5 billion, is the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built by NASA. An additional $500 million has been
spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop
computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space
Agency is paying 15 percent of the costs.
   Discovery's five astronauts say they won't breathe easy until
the Hubble is safe in space. For scientists, the nerve-racking wait
will be longer.
   ``Their hearts are going to be beating, they're going to have
butterflies and they're not going to be happy until several weeks
after we release it and they start getting data,'' said Marine Col.
Charles F. Bolden Jr., Discovery's pilot.
   Hawley will use the shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm to remove
the Hubble from Discovery on the second day of the five-day
mission. NASA wants to deploy the telescope as soon as possible
into the flight to minimize the risk of contaminating its 8-foot
primary optical mirror.
   ``We're taking every possible precaution to be able to back up
any potential problem that we have in deploying the telescope,''
said William Reeves, NASA's lead flight director for the mission.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will go out to help extricate, adjust or
repair the telescope, if necessary. The cabin's pressure will be
lowered three hours into the flight and remain low for several days
to shorten the four-hour response time normally required for a
spacewalk.
   It is estimated the Hubble will cost $200 million a year to
operate and maintain in orbit.
   Within a month or two, data for test images will be sent via
satellite to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
   Six scientific committees chose 160 proposals from the world's
astronomers, including five amateurs, for the instrument's first
year of observation starting in December. Ten times more observing
time was requested than the institute was able to grant. Every
year, new proposals will be accepted.
   In 1993, a shuttle is scheduled to go up to service the
telescope and, since its orbit inevitably will decay over time,
boost it back up to a proper altitude. Further maintenance missions
will be scheduled every three years. Any emergency work would have
to be squeezed into the shuttle's already crowded flight agenda,
said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
   ``More than likely, you would have to dedicate a mission because
the altitudes are so high,'' Shriver said.
   Discovery's ascent to 380 miles will be the highest a shuttle
has ever gone. The astronauts will bring the telescope back if it
cannot be deployed safely. But that would be a last resort, Hawley
said.
   ``We're going to do anything we can do to leave the telescope in
orbit so that it has a chance for a mission,'' Hawley said.

   The Discovery astronauts breathed
``a little sigh of relief'' after they finished the tricky task of
putting the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
   During a news conference this morning from space, the five crew
members said there was little time for talk or celebration
Wednesday when the telescope was released from the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm.
   ``You have to realize that had we just spent a pretty tense time
with a $1.5 billion telescope and we have a couple billion-dollar
orbiter and we just separated the two and we're still within inches
of each other,'' Discovery Commander Loren Shriver said. ``Saying
something was the last thing on my mind.''
   Mission specialist Steve Hawley, who gently guided the robot arm
as it hoisted the Hubble out of the cargo bay, said he didn't
really think about the accomplishment until after it was all over.
   ``Only later in the day when we got a chance to take a breath
and maybe give out a little sigh of relief and think, `Gee, we
actually got it done.' And at that moment I think we were all very
pleased and satisfied to be part of the team that did this,'' he
said.
   Hawley added that there was really only one tense moment during
the telescope's deployment: ``Just the part from beginning to the
end.''
   The crew members took time out today to answer questions radioed
to them from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. They were spending
most of the day stowing their gear and experiments and testing the
shuttle's control systems in preparation for Sunday's landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were
prepared to perform an emergency space walk Wednesday if there had
been trouble deploying the telescope. They had trained for such a
procedure for years, but one wasn't necessary.
   ``Either one of us was trained and ready to work,'' Sullivan
said.
   Both astronauts already have walked in space on previous
missions, but McCandless admitted to being ``a little disappointed
not to have an EVA,'' for extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk.
   The astronauts agreed that the mission was a special one since
Hubble will enable astronomers to search the heavens for new worlds
and clues to creation itself.
   ``Almost everybody seems to be familiar with what the telescope
is and what it was designed to do,'' Shriver said.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' added pilot Charles Bolden. ``It
makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to
learn how to add and subtract and study science.
   ``And that's extremely gratifying to know that you're part of a
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world
about something.''

The proposed U.S. space station will begin to wear out while being built, 
requiring an unrealistic number of spacewalks for repairs before astronauts are 
even aboard to do them, a NASA study released Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings raise questions about the feasibility of the proposed $30-billion 
space station, seen as the centerpiece of NASA's future space program, at a 
time when the space agency is already reeling from a series of setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
But space station director Richard Kohrs said he was confident the agency could 
overcome the potential problem and reduce the need for maintenance to a more 
realistic level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we'll get it down. It's going to take us two or three months but 
we . . . will be well within reason," Kohrs said. 
</P>
<P>
John Pike of the American Federation of Scientists was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they still have some serious unsolved problems that they're going to 
have to solve before they get the show on the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is already under fire because the space shuttle fleet has been grounded by 
fuel leaks and a defect in the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope has blurred 
the observatory's potentially revolutionary view of the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The blunders have triggered a storm of criticism in Congress, which is 
considering NASA's $15-billion proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to begin building the 
500-foot-long space station Freedom in 1996 or 1997 as an orbiting outpost 
where astronauts can conduct scientific experiments and stage exploration into 
the solar system.

   Astronaut Donald E. Williams, a
decorated Navy captain who flew 330 combat missions in Vietnam, is
commanding Atlantis on its mission to deploy a nuclear-powered
probe to Jupiter.
   Williams, 47, an astronaut for 11 years, flew one previous
shuttle mission, as pilot of Discovery, in 1985.
   Williams said he looked forward to flying in space again. ``It's
been quite a long time,'' he said.
   The Lafayette, Ind., native received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Purdue in 1964. He and his wife, Linda,
have two children; Jonathan, 15; and Barbara 13.
   ``The mission is a very exciting one in my mind,'' Williams
said. ``We're going to greatly increase the knowledge of humankind
... as a result of this mission.''
   Characterizing his first shuttle flight as ``one of the
highlights'' of his career, Williams added it also has been a
longtime goal to command a mission.
   Williams wasn't sure he will be ready to hang up his flight suit
after the Atlantis mission.
   ``I'd certainly like to fly again if that seems to be in the
program,'' he said.

   Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley, one
of two space rookies assigned to the Atlantis mission, looked
forward to gazing down at the Earth while he was in orbit.
   McCulley, 46, the pilot of Atlantis, is making his first shuttle
mission after being an astronaut for five years.
   He was born in San Diego, Calif., but considers Livingston,
Tenn., his hometown. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees
in metallurgical engineering from Purdue University.
   His wife, Jane, is an amateur artist who helped design the
flight patch for the Atlantis crew. McCulley has five children;
Marla, 20; Marcy, 17; Cynthia, 14; Robyn, 10; and Sarah, 3.
   McCulley entered the Navy as an enlisted man and served on one
diesel and two nuclear-powered submarines. He received his
officer's commission in 1970.
   ``The thing that excites me the most (about flying in space) is
to think about looking out and being able to see a round horizon
... being able to see much of the world,'' he said.
   When NASA officials told him he would be on the Galileo mission,
McCulley said he was thrilled to be part of a project he can follow
for years.
   ``I'm so fortunate, it's incredible,'' McCulley said in a recent
interview. ``I came out of high school when I was 17 years old and
joined the Navy, and here I am, 10 or 11 promotions later, getting
ready to go fly in space. I have very few complaints about life.''

   Shannon Lucid, a mission specialist
and veteran of one previous shuttle mission, rode the shuttle into
space Wednesday to play a key role in the deployment of the Galileo
probe.
   Mrs. Lucid, 46, had the job of checking Galileo's rocket
booster. The two-stage rocket was to propel the probe out of Earth
orbit to start it on a six-year journey to Jupiter.
   The biochemist flew one previous shuttle mission in 1985.
   She was born in Shanghai, where her parents were missionaries.
Just six weeks after her birth, the family was taken prisoner by
the Japanese. A year later, they were released in a prisoner
exchange.
   She received her bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from
the University of Oklahoma, and was selected as an astronaut in 1978
   When she was young, she wanted to be an explorer but she thought
there wouldn't be much left to explore by the time she grew up.
After reading science fiction and reports about work on a rocket,
she came to another conclusion.
   ``I was thinking, well shoot, we've got the whole universe. No
one will have it all explored by the time I grow up. So I thought
that's what I'd like to be when I grew up. Of course, the United
States didn't have a space program at that time.''
   She and her husband, Michael have three children; Kawai, 21;
Shandara, 19; and Michael, 14.

   Mission specialist Ellen S. Baker,
a physician and space rookie, was sitting alone on the middeck
during the shuttle's blastoff Wednesday.
   Once in orbit, Mrs. Baker, 36, was responsible for checking the
Galileo space probe before deployment. She and fellow astronaut
Franklin Chang-Diaz also were designated to make a spacewalk if one
was required.
   She was born in Fayetteville, N.C., but her family later moved
to New York City, where her mother, Claire Shulman, is president of
the borough of Queens. She earned a bachelor's degree in geology
from State University of New York at Buffalo and received her
doctorate in medicine from Cornell.
   She joined NASA in 1981 as a medical officer at the Johnson
Space Center.
   She said she went to NASA to be a doctor, but after three years
decided she wanted to be an astronaut. She was selected as an
astronaut in 1984.
   She and her husband, Kenneth, have a 1-year-old daughter, Karen.
   Mrs. Baker said it was difficult for her to believe she finally
would be flying in space.
   ``You work in a place so long, and the time finally arrives
...,'' she said. ``It hasn't really clicked just yet.''

   Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, a
physicist doubling as a mission specialist and flight engineer
aboard Atlantis, has flown on one previous shuttle.
   During the shuttle's liftoff and landing, his job was to monitor
displays on the flight deck with the commander, pilot and mission
specialist Shannon Lucid.
   Chang-Diaz also was to help photograph the deployment of the
Galileo probe, and he, along with mission specialist Ellen Baker
would participate in any unscheduled spacewalk.
   Chang-Diaz, 39, a native of Costa Rica and a naturalized U.S.
citizen, received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
from the University of Connecticut and a doctorate in applied
plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1977.
   Chang-Diaz, a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, became an astronaut in 1980 and made his first
shuttle flight in 1986 aboard Columbia.
   He and his wife, Peggy, have three children: Jean, 15; Sonia,
11; and Lidia, 1.
   Chang-Diaz said he also works on ways to help Latin American
countries get involved in space programs and hopes he can one day
help establish an agency in the Western Hemisphere that is similar
to the European Space Agency.

   A still-unexplained problem has
developed with a computerized display unit in space shuttle
Columbia, but it is not expected to delay this week's launch, a
NASA official said today.
   Technicians replaced the so-called ``heads-up display,'' which
projects data used by the shuttle's commander during landing, on
Sunday night, but that did not fix the problem. NASA tried to
determine today what was wrong with the display unit's related
equipment.
   ``That's really our only real problem. Everything else is going
very smoothly,'' NASA test director Al Sofge said at a morning
briefing.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
   After the unit was removed, it tested normally and the
replacement unit was not working, prompting NASA officials to
suspect a related piece of equipment _ the display unit's
electronics package, Sofge said.
   Sofge said officials should know by midday whether the problem
indeed lies with that electronics package. If necessary,
technicians will replace the device, about the size of a
videocassette recorder and located in the middeck.
   It will take about eight hours to replace the electronics
package and another eight hours to test it, Sofge said. That work
can be performed while other countdown procedures continue, he said.
   There is ``a very remote possibility'' the problem could lie
with yet another part, the display unit's power control assembly,
but even that wouldn't necessarily delay the launch, Sofge said.
   ``If it turns out that it is the PCA, we still think we can go
ahead and change that out and make the launch date,'' he said.
   The mission already has been delayed two weeks because of
repairs to the shuttle's cooling system at the launch pad.
   Columbia's seven astronauts, meanwhile, say they are eager to
get started on a mission to explore high-energy ultraviolet light
and X-rays emitted from stars and galaxies.
   ``Everything's big on this mission,'' Columbia commander Vance
Brand said Sunday. ``We have a big crew. We have a lot of days on
orbit, nine or 10, and we think a lot of good and important things
to do.''
   The crew _ the biggest since the 1986 Challenger explosion _
arrived late Sunday morning in five trainer jets from Johnson Space
Center in Houston. The countdown began as planned at 1 a.m. Sunday.
   ``We know we have a great ship, and we're ready to go,'' Brand
said.
   Air Force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of
favorable weather at launch time.
   Columbia will be carrying a $150 million observatory called
Astro that will be operated round-the-clock by four crew members
who are astronomers. Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one
X-ray telescope will scan space from Columbia's payload bay as the
shuttle orbits 218 miles above Earth.
   Because of the flight's duration, five sets of fuel storage
tanks will be used instead of the customary three to provide power
to the orbiting shuttle, Leinbach said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration loaded the
on-board tanks with liquid oxygen and hydrogen this morning.
   Technicians on Sunday finished restocking the X-ray telescope
with argon, needed to keep its heat-sensitive instruments cold.
Columbia has six days in which to lift off, after which the flight
will be delayed a week so more argon can be added.
   It will be the first mission since 1985 to use components of
Spacelab, a research facility designed for orbiting shuttles.
Crewmen will use Spacelab computers in the rear flight deck to
operate Astro, anchored in the payload bay.
   No spacewalks are planned, although astronauts Mike Lounge and
Jeffrey Hoffman are prepared to venture outside the cabin if one of
the telescopes needs repairs or readjustment.
   Astro will probe ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from
stars, the Comet Austin and other matter in space. Little is known
about those kinds of radiation because the wavelengths cannot
penetrate the atmosphere and thus cannot be studied from the ground.

   Navy Capt. Dick Richards,
Discovery's commander, is traveling into space for the second time
in a little more than a year.
   The former test pilot made his first shuttle flight August 1989
on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Richards, 44, said before the flight that he believed a
successful mission would help people forget about NASA's recent
troubles, which include hydrogen leaks aboard the Atlantis and
Columbia space shuttles.
   ``Right now, we don't look so good,'' he said.
   But he denied that NASA's recent misfortunes have put additional
pressure on his crew or the launch team at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to
get a space shuttle into orbit.
   ``They treat us like we're fragile commodities down there,'' he
said, adding he believes the space agency has been quite
conservative in handling mechanical problems in the post-Challenger
era.
   Richards was born in Key West, Fla., but grew up in St. Louis
where he graduated from Riverview Gardens High School. He earned a
bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of
Missouri and a master's degree in aeronautical systems from the
University of West Florida.
   After earning his bachelor's degree, he joined the Navy. He
became a naval aviator and later went to the U.S. Navy test pilot
school.
   Richards served as a project test pilot for development work on
automatic carrier landing systems for F-4 and A-7 aircraft.
   He was on his way to an assignment with a fighter squadron when
he learned he had been selected as an astronaut candidate in 1980.
   Richards is married. His flight experience includes more than
4,000 hours in 16 different kinds of airplanes.

   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Cabana is
making his first trip into space as the pilot aboard Discovery.
   The 41-year-old astronaut said before the launch that he was
looking forward to his first trip into space, calling it ``the
culmination of a lot of years of work on my part.''
   Cabana is quick to defend NASA, attributing the recent rash of
problems to mere coincidence, not carelessness.
   ``I think NASA is going to come through this and do just fine.
... I haven't seen any complacency at all,'' Cabana said. ``There's
no push to do anything unsafely.''
   Cabana was born in Minneapolis where he graduated from Washburn
High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the
Naval Academy.
   He also graduated from the Navy test pilot school and later
served as a test pilot for flight systems and ordnance separation
testing on aircraft.
   NASA selected him as an astronaut in 1986. He and his wife have
three children.
   When the Discovery mission ends, Cabana said he plans to get
back in line and wait for another flight assignment. He hopes to
command his own shuttle mission.
   ``I want to stay here and fly shuttles as long as they let me,''
he said.

   Navy Capt. Bill Shepherd, a veteran
of a previous shuttle mission, is the flight engineer aboard
Discovery.
   Shepherd, 41, first flew into space aboard Atlantis on a secret
Defense Department mission in December 1988. He was a mission
specialist on that flight.
   On this mission, Shepherd is taking on the additional role of
flight engineer, who assists the commander and pilot during takeoff
and landing.
   Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn. He graduated from Arcadia
High School in Scottsdale, Ariz., and earned a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the Naval Academy.
   He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering.
   After graduating from the Naval Academy, he served with an

   Discovery mission specialist Bruce
E. Melnick is the first astronaut selected from the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Melnick, a Coast Guard commander, is one of two Discovery
astronauts designated to perform a spacewalk during the mission
should an emergency arise.
   Melnick said he first wanted to be an astronaut as a youth when
he watched Alan Shepherd become the first American to fly in space.
   ``But I didn't think it was a realistic goal,'' Melnick said.
   Melnick was born in New York City, but he grew up in Clearwater,
Fla., where he graduated from Clearwater High School.
   He worked on fishing boats in Florida and became interested in
the Coast Guard planes he saw flying in the area. Being a Coast
Guard pilot, he said, seemed a more realistic goal - ``so that's
the direction I took.''
   After earning a bachelor's degree in engineering from the Coast
Guard Academy, he was assigned as a deck watch officer aboard a
cutter. Sixteen months later, he went to Navy flight training.
   He earned his wings in 1974 and a master's degree in

   Space shuttle Atlantis lifted off
into a windy sky at the last possible minute Friday _ a
spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a $500 million secret
satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance
America's capacity to spy on the Soviets.
   Not a word was heard outside the NASA and Air Force control rooms
from commander Robert Gibson or the four other military crewmen who
are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18-ton
satellite Lacrosse.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge, who observed the liftoff
from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying ``let me
tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nation's
national security.''
   NASA waited out the same kind of fierce, high-altitude winds that
caused the postponement of the flight Thursday, found a momentary
calm, and set Atlantis flying almost straight up on a northward path
from the Kennedy Space Center. Liftoff time was exactly 9:30:34 EST
_ less than 90 seconds before the end of the three-hour launch
opportunity period.
   ``Very clean, by the numbers,'' is how mission commentator Brian
Welch at Mission Control in Houston characterized the start of the
flight. ``The vehicle is in very clean shape. There are no systems
problems whatsoever to report.''
   The public communications system, a 24-hour operation on most
shuttle flights, fell silent thereafter. Acting on Air Force orders,
NASA planned to break that silence only to say that the astronauts
had an OK to proceed with their mission's task and to give 24-hour
notice for Atlantis' return. The flight is expected to last three or
four days with landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   The first announcement came four hours into flight, when Mission
Control reported: ``The crew of Atlantis is go for orbit
operations.'' That meant the ship's cargo bay doors were open and
the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin.
   ``All crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily,'' Mission Control said.
   Navy Cmdr. Gibson's crew is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner,
the pilot; Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the
Air Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   The outlines of their mission no longer are a secret _ not even
to the Soviets _ but details remain classified. Filling Atlantis'
cargo hold is one of the most expensive satellites ever built. It is
not deterred by clouds or darkness from gathering radar images on
the ground below.
   Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third
all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides.
It was the third time Atlantis had been launched into orbit.
   The shuttle was in view of the launch site well past the
two-minute point when its spent booster rockets fell off. The
failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of
Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986.
   According to sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified, Mullane will use the shuttle's crane to drop the
satellite _ one of a series named Lacrosse _ overboard. The
satellite's orbit will take it over the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, and the information it gleans should help U.S. intelligence
officials verify Soviet arms control compliance as well as serving
as a ``radar eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber.
   Defense officials contended the secrecy made it more difficult
for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the Florida coast to monitor
the flight and learn its purpose.
   According to the official news agency Tass, the Soviets already
know much about Lacrosse. Its antenna, sources said, spreads out 150
feet and it has a 100-foot long radar screen.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for Saturday,
Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm to lift the
satellite out of the cargo bay. Shepherd and Ross reportedly will be
suited up in the spacecraft airlock, prepared to make a spacewalk if
there is a problem with the satellite release.
   After the Lacrosse is set free, Gibson and Gardner are to back
off several hundred feet and fly formation with the payload until
ground controllers are certain it is working properly. If it is not,
an effort may be made to retrieve it for return to Earth.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority.
   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device
that resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises
that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic
missile launches.
   The countdown was halted several times during the morning to wait
out high-altitude winds up to 126 mph. Starting before dawn, a pilot
flew continuously through the launch path and balloons were sent
aloft to take readings.
   Thursday's launch had been scrubbed by strong winds eight miles
high and clouds made conditions marginal at best. Friday, by
contrast, the sky was brilliantly blue and there was bright sunshine
above fleecy clouds. The troublesome winds were five miles up.
   Toward the end of the 6:32-to-9:32 a.m. ``window of
opportunity,'' launch control got balloon data that showed
acceptable winds. The count continued only to be halted again at the
31-second mark, because of concern about weather at a site in Spain
where the shuttle would have landed in case of emergency.
   ``You gave us some heart failure there toward the end, but we got
it off,'' NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher told the launch team.
``My thanks for another great job.''

   Installing a donut-shaped device on the
outside of the Hubble Space Telescope is one idea that NASA
scientists are discussing to partially correct the instrument's
focusing flaw.
   Officials said Tuesday that a ``donut'' could be installed by
spacewalking astronauts to partially close the eye of Hubble. This
would sharpen the telescope focus slightly, but could present other
problems, NASA experts said.
   Meanwhile, James Beggs, the NASA administrator during the era
that the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, testifies before
Congress today for the first time since it was discovered that the
$1.5 billion telescope is seriously flawed.
   Beggs, who headed the space agency from 1981 to 1986, is
expected to be questioned about tests that were conducted on the
space telescope when the instrument was being assembled during the
early 1980s.
   The Hubble was discovered last month to have a basic focusing
flaw in its two main mirror optics. This causes it to see the
universe as a blur instead of the sharp, crisp images of distant
stars that the space agency had claimed it would see.
   The New York Times reported today that NASA has a backup mirror
for the Hubble that could have been used to replace the telescope's
mirror if testing had been performed on the ground to find the
focusing flaw. The Times quoted experts as saying they believed the
backup mirror, now in storage, could have been optically superior
to the one that was used.
   Ed Weiler, chief scientist for the Hubble project, said Tuesday
that the blurry vision of the telescope could be slightly improved
if spacewalking astronauts were to place a device that would narrow
the light-gathering opening of the instrument.
   Weiler said it would be like ``putting a donut on the outside of
the tube'' with light going through the donut hole. This would
restrict the light entering the aperture and improve the focus. He
said, however, the improvement would only be by ``a factor of two
or three'' and would reduce the amount of light seen by the
telescope.
   The Hubble still would not focus as crisply as scientists had
expected, he said, adding that there also was a risk of making
things even worse.
   ``I don't think the scientists would want to take that risk for
a factor of two or three'' improvement, he said.
   In congressional hearings today, Beggs was appearing before a
subcommittee chaired by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
   As NASA administrator, Beggs was in charge when the Hubble
mirrors were being made. Engineers have said Hubble's problems
originated with a mistake in the mirror manufacturing process and
that the error could have been detected with proper testing.
   In a report published in Space Business News, an industry trade
journal, Beggs said the Air Force had a facility that could have
detected the Hubble flaw, but that NASA was not permitted to use
the facility for tests.
   Mikulski, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
independent agencies such as NASA, has said she is outraged about
the Hubble mistake. She ordered the hearings to find out what went
wrong.
   Appearing with Beggs were Richard Truly, the current NASA
administrator; Lennard Fisk, the space agency's top scientist, and
William Lenoir, NASA's director of space flight.
   For Fisk, it was to be the fourth appearance before a
congressional committee since the Hubble problem was discovered. He
has twice testified before another Senate subcommittee, and once
before a House committee.
   Truly has been quizzed several times by Congress about Hubble
and also about hydrogen leaks discovered in two space shuttles. The
leaks caused the shuttle fleet to be grounded.
   In a news conference on Tuesday, Lenoir said the source of the
leaks had been found and that shuttle flights could resume as early
as next month.

   Five astronauts boarded Discovery
today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to
the beginning of time.
   ``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of
what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk,
head of NASA science activities.
   Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the
weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the
scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
   More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into
the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space
Center.
   The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give
astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   ``It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say
what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn
many new things.''
   Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th
shuttle mission.
   Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro
observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the
second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986
just before the Challenger explosion.
   Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983,
delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The
latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit
on the shuttle.
   The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less
festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of
astronomers gathered with their families.
   The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will
use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope
into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn
Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
   Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days
until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by
satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it
will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina _ a week after launch.
   In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has
been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software
to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed
$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
   NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and
maintain the telescope in space.
   During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide
astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more
sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will
be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15
billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery
surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is
expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
   The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His
work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created
by a tremendous explosion.
   In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled
with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts
receive. It is the skull's third trip into space.
   The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   Discovery's astronauts, having
consigned the world's most sophisticated communications satellite
to its 22,300-mile-high outpost, turned their attention to science
Friday as they whirled around Earth in their stockinged feet.
   ``They are having a ball,'' said a flight director.
   Back at Cape Canaveral, the redesigned booster rockets that
powered the first post-Challenger launch toward orbit Thursday were
towed into port and, divers who inspected them said they appeared
in perfect condition.
   The five astronauts were quickly proving to be a quiet,
businesslike crew as they looked down from their 184-mile perch at
interesting ocean currents, observed soil erosion in Mexico caused
by Hurricane Gilbert, watched how solutions separate in space and
did just plain sightseeing over the blue globe below.
   Conversations were confined to essentials, with little banter.
But when a television link with the ground failed to work _ the
antenna refused to move into usable position _ Commander Frederick
H. Hauck offered to help, saying ``We'll enjoy using our mechanical
talents.''
   The antenna problem persisted but its effect on the flight was
minimal. When the same thing happened four years ago, the repair
was performed by an astronaut who was taking a spacewalk anyway. No
such action was contemplated on this flight.
   The crew also had to contend with a temperature of 84 degrees in
the cabin, caused by a lingering malfunction in the cooling system.
A cumbersome fix was available, but Hauck passed it up, saying
``we're in good shape.''
   ``The orbiter is great, the systems on board the orbiter are
doing quite well,'' said J. Milton Heflin, a flight director in
Houston. ``We've talked about two or three problems today but, my
goodness, out of all the hardware aboard is operating just super,
and I can detect that in the voices of the crew. They are having a
ball.''
   The astronauts surprised Mission Control by playing the music of
``I Heard it Through the Grapevine'' as they were eating lunch. It
was a rejoinder to the day's wake-up call from the ground:
``G-o-o-d Morning, Discovery!'' Robin Williams, who perfected his
deejay routine in the movie, ``Good Morning Vietnam,'' prepared the
tape.
   In a televised science lesson from space, astronauts George D.
Nelson and David C. Hilmers demonstrated an experiment involving
cell separation in weightlessness. Hilmers explained it could have
medical applications such as separating malignant from
non-malignant cells.
   In Earth's gravity, when materials like the astronauts are
testing are mixed, the lighter one tends to float to the top.
Hilmers said in zero gravity it was more like a yolk floating
inside the egg white.
   The crew also was asked to photograph ``some of the natural
phenomena of the planet Earth'' _ including Pacific thunderstorms,
a volcano lava flow in Ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from the
Hurricane Gilbert on the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The astronauts all have been in space before and there were none
of the gee-whiz expressions that have been a staple of the shuttle
program.
   The worrisome booster rockets that carried the shuttle
flawlessly at the start of its journey, were towed into Port
Canaveral, near the launch site, apparently showing no sign of the
leaks that doomed the Challenger 32 months ago.
   ``The divers report the boosters are in perfect condition,''
said Rocky Raab, spokesman for booster manufacturer Morton Thiokol.
   He said the divers, who fished the rockets from the Atlantic for
inspection and refurbishment ``would see evidence if the joint were
leaking. They would see soot and the weather seals would be blown
off.''
   ``There was none of that,'' he said.
   Since Challenger, the boosters had undergone a major redesign to
ensure that the joints between segments would no longer allow hot
gases to escape: a problem on nine previous flights and the
malfunction that caused the space shuttle's destruction with its
loss of seven lives.
   The weather seals are inch-thick blankets _ made like electrical
tapes that prevent pipes from freezing _ to keep the joint seals
pliable at 75 degrees.
   Raab said it will be two weeks before the rocket shells are
taken apart for a minute inspection of the seals.
   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite released by the
crew from Discovery's cargo bay late Thursday, was in its proper
orbit after a journey of 22,000 miles, and Mission Control told the
crew their launch was ``with considerable precision.''
   ``We're there. We're on orbit. We're very, very happy,'' said Ed
Bangsund of Boeing, manufacturer of the rocket stage that sent the
satellite to its final orbit. The TDRS will join another on orbit
since 1983 to give NASA communications contact with future shuttles
85 percent of the time.
   It also will serve as an orbital switchboard for up to 24
satellites, including some that will transmit coded military
information.
   The successful deployment was a major boost for NASA's TDRS
program, which has had trouble from the start. The first satellite
almost didn't make it when the Boeing rocket lost its steering
ability. In an almost miraculous rescue, controllers inched it to
its high orbit over a two-month period by using small steering
thrusters the size of a garden hose nozzle.
   In 1985, NASA removed a second TDRS from its shuttle cargo
schedule for redesign because of problems with one in orbit. The
next attempt to launch the satellite was in 1986. It was in the
cargo bay of the Challenger when it exploded after launch.
   NASA and the Pentagon considered the satellite so important it
was scheduled as the cargo for the first post-Challenger mission.
Another is set for launch in January.
   ``The launch and us getting back to space is something that
really means a lot to me,'' Richard Truly, the NASA shuttle chief
who supervised the post-Challenger recovery, said Friday. ``And
looking at today's front pages, I think it means a lot to the
country.
   The second day's flight plan was deliberately conservative to
enable the crew to carefully check the scores of system
modifications made in the spacecraft since the Challenger
explosion. ``We're not breaking any new ground,'' pilot Richard
Covey said before the launch.
   Discovery's four-day mission is to end with a landing on the
desert runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 12:33 p.m.
EDT on Monday.

   The long-delayed Columbia flight is
commanded by Vance Brand, a veteran of three previous missions and
the oldest person to fly in space.
   Columbia's seven-member crew also includes four astronomers who
will take turns manning the $150 million Astro observatory. The
scientists will operate the observatory's three ultraviolet
telescopes, while an X-ray telescope will be managed by computer
commands from the ground.
   Two crew members are payload specialists, non-space-agency
employees who will help operate the observatory. It is the first
time since the Challenger accident that payload specialists have
flown aboard a shuttle.

<HEAD>---</HEAD>

   At age 59, Brand is the oldest person to fly in space. He said
Columbia probably will be his last flight.
   ``I'll probably move on to a management job, a second career if
you will, at this late day. But, frankly, there isn't anything that
beats flying in space,'' Brand said in an interview earlier this
year.
   Two other astronauts are older than Brand, but neither has flown
for five or more years.
   Brand joined the astronaut corps in 1966 after serving in the
Marines as a naval aviator and working as a test pilot for Lockheed
Aircraft Corp.
   His three previous trips into space included the historic July
1975 Apollo-Soyuz linkup, the first fully operational shuttle
flight in November 1982 and the 10th shuttle flight in February
1984.
   Although some astronauts have left the highflying career to
assume management roles in the space agency or pursue other
interests, Brand has been happy to stay and wait his turn for
mission assignments.
   ``I suppose a lot of people would do this until their 90 years
old if they could,'' he said.
   But he conceded that the problem now is getting back in the long
line again.
   Brand was born in Longmont, Colo., where he graduated from
Longmont High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in business and
in aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado and a
master's degree in business administration from the University of
California at Los Angeles.
   He is married and has six children.

   Columbia pilot Guy Gardner, an Air Force colonel, has made one
previous trip into space aboard a secret military flight in
December 1988.
   The flight, the second shuttle mission after the Challenger
accident, carried an all-military crew. This time, Gardner is the
sole active military man among the seven crew members.
   During the 10-day mission, Gardner will steer the shuttle while
two other astronauts on his shift operate the Astro observatory.
The crew is divided into two groups so that work can continue
around the clock.
   Gardner, 42, grew up in Alexandria, Va., where he graduated from
George Washington High School. He earned a bachelor's in
engineering sciences, astronautics and math from the Air Force
Academy and a master's in astronautics from Purdue.
   He flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s
and later attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Gardner was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. He is married
and has three children.
   ``I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was a kid because I've
always been interested in outer space,'' Gardner said.
   In elementary school, he read science fiction books and dreamed
of exploring the heavens. Astronauts then were test pilots, and
that fact guided him during his military career, he said.
   After the Columbia flight, Gardner said, he plans to get back in
line for another mission. He hopes to command a flight.

hours daily while two astronomers operate the observatory. He also
is trained to perform an emergency spacewalk if necessary.
   Although his pilot duties should keep him busy, Lounge said he
hopes to find some time to look out the window.
   ``You never get tired of that,'' he said.
   Lounge, 44, grew up in Burlington, Colo., and graduated from
Burlington High School. He earned a bachelor's in physics and math
from the Naval Academy and a master's in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   He joined the Navy in 1969 and spent the next nine years on
various assignments.
   In 1974, he became a physics instructor at the Naval Academy.
Two years later, he transferred to the Navy Space Project office in
Washington as a staff project officer.
   He resigned his regular Navy commission in 1978 and joined the
Naval Air Reserve. He is a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Air
National Guard.
   Lounge has three children. His wife, Kathryn, is a payload
integration manager at the Johnson Space Center.
   He began working at the space center in 1978 as an engineer and
was selected as an astronaut two years later.
   Lounge first flew into space on a 1985 shuttle flight. Three
years later, he was a crew member aboard the first shuttle to fly
after the Challenger explosion.

   Mission specialist Robert Parker, one of four astronomers on
board who will operate the Astro observatory, is making his second
trip into space. He also flew on the first Spacelab mission in
1988.
   The 53-year-old astronaut said in an interview earlier this year
that the most challenging part of the mission will be to get the
observatory working.
   ``I'm especially looking forward to the fun of going observing
(in space) for a whole week,'' he added.
   Parker was born in New York City but grew up in Shrewsbury,
Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy and physics from
Amherst College and a doctorate in astronomy from the California
Institute of Technology.
   After being selected as an astronaut in 1967, he served on
astronaut ground support crews for the Apollo 15 and 17 missions
and as program scientist for the Skylab program director's office.
   For a year beginning in 1988, he was director of the space
flight-space station integration office at NASA headquarters in
Washington.
   He and his wife have four children.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts End Six-Month Mission With Rich Payload</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by
technical problems and a perilous spacewalk returned to Earth on
Thursday with a multimillion-ruble payload of space-grown crystals.
   The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin landed on the Central Asian steppes at 11:34 a.m., one
minute ahead of schedule.
   The landing was not broadcast live on Soviet television. But the
midday ``Vremya'' TV news program showed the cosmonauts waving
goodbye to their replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space
station Mir.
   ``Back in the landing spaceship, we felt the slightly bitter
smell of absinthe in the Kazakh steppe,'' Solovyev told reporters
after landing and ending his six-month stay in space.
   ``I also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh delicious
apples when I was back on Earth,'' he said in remarks carried by
the Tass news agency.
   Solovyev and Balandin were launched into space Feb. 11 in what
was trumpeted as the first manned mission in the 33-year history of
the Soviet space program to turn a multimillion-dollar profit.
   They conducted hundreds of experiments, photographed 8.4 million
square miles of the Earth's surface and grew 23 pure crystals for
semiconductors and computer chips, Tass said.
   Tass said they also studied the influence of space flight on the
development and behavior of birds, and that this would help develop
life-support systems for future manned spacecraft.
   Crystals grown in the zero-gravity environment of space tend to
have far fewer imperfections, such as ripples or other impurites,
than those produced on Earth. The crystals are sliced into thin
sheets and etched to create tiny circuits, or semiconductors, with
optimum conductivity.
   Tass said each of the 23 crystals grown on the Mir station was
worth $1 million, but the news agency did not say how big the
crystals were or what material they were grown from.
   A $23 million profit from the space venture likely would help
the cash-hungry Soviet government fend off criticism about the cost
of its space program.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressure has grown on the
costly, but once sacrosanct, space program to prove its worth in a
society where many people do not have decent housing or enough
quality food to eat.
   Future expeditions to Mir will carry paying passengers. The
first will be an employee of the Tokyo Broadcasting System, who
will have a seat on an eight-day mission beginning Dec. 2.
   The Japanese passenger will return to Earth with the two
cosmonauts currently aboard Mir, Gennady Manakov and Gennady
Strekalov.
   Manakov and Strekalov, who replaced Solovyev and Balandin,
docked with the space station Aug. 3, two days after blasting off
from the Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan.
   They will conduct an estimated 250 experiments over the next six
months, including growing more crystals and making two spacewalks.
   Solovyev and Balandin made a life-threatening spacewalk July 17
to repair their capsule's thermal insulation, which was torn on
takeoff. The repairs took seven hours, longer than anticipated, and
their life-support supplies nearly ran out.
   Having damaged the exit-and-entry hatch at the beginning of the
spacewalk, the cosmonauts were forced to return through an
emergency porthole. In their haste, they left behind handrails
attached to the exterior of the capsule.
   A second spacewalk was required July 26 to retrieve the
handrails and fix the hatch.

   Two cosmonauts left the orbiting space station Mir
today to make a second attempt to repair a Dutch-made telescope,
Radio Moscow reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were using new tools and
materials brought to the space station by the cargo ferry ship
Progress recently, the broadcast said.
   Titov and Manarov had tried unsuccessfully in a five-hour space
walk June 30 to replace a detector unit on the telescope, which was
mounted on an observatory attached to Mir. Components of the unit
melted because of exposure to cosmic radiation, Radio Moscow said.
The problem in the June repair attempt was that the cosmonauts
couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the balky detector unit to the
telescope, the Tass news agency said at the time.
   In today's space walk, scheduled to last several hours, Titov
and Manarov were wearing new spacesuits designed to allow the
cosmonauts more flexibility, Soviet television reported.
   Titov and Manarov have been aboard Mir since last December and
are scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning
to Earth this December, Soviet officials have said.
   A third cosmonaut, Dr. Valery Polyakov, arrived aboard Mir in
September to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov. Polyakov
stayed inside the space station during Thursday's spacewalk to
check on-board systems and the health of Titov and Manarov, Tass
said.
   The Mir station was launched Feb. 20, 1986 and the Kvant
orbiting observatory was attached to it in early 1987.

<LEADPARA>  After an extra day in space caused by gusty winds, the space shuttle Atlantis
returned to Earth on Thursday, touching down at 6:55 a.m. PDT at Edwards Air
Force Base in Southern California. About 1,000 people withstood the 37-degree
temperature and wind gusts up to 21 mph to greet the crew that launched the
second of NASA's four great observatories and performed the first U.S.
spacewalk in five years.;    The landing ended 1991's first shuttle mission, a
six-day trip for Atlantis commander Steven Nagel, pilot Ken Cameron and
specialists Jerry Ross, Linda Godwin and Jay Apt. Soon, the Gamma Ray
Observatory launched by Atlantis will start scanning the heavens for gamma
rays, which penetrate interstellar gas and dust, allowing astronomers to study
very distant objects.  </LEADPARA>

   Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions
are hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers to
add tons of shielding to protect the proposed U.S. space station
and its crew.
   Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the
U.S. Space Command and more than half came from satellites or spent
rockets that ``have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons,'' a
NASA expert says.
   More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably,
but Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he doubts the cause is
collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti-satellite
weapons.
   ``They are like a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Kessler said
in a telephone interview. ``These explosions have occurred
everywhere, from one day (after launch) to three years.''
   Space station planners, ``faced with a considerable design
problem,'' are adding 2,000 pounds to the shielding of each of the
six modules occupied by astronauts.
   ``The debris gets most severe at 500-600 miles,'' Kessler said,
``but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and don't
require the same level of safety as a crew.'' The space shuttle
generally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will the
space station.
   ``When I first started working in this area, very few people
knew how their spacecraft were breaking up, including the
designers,'' Kessler said. ``The Space Command knew they were
breaking up, but never took the time to identify why.''
   He said officials have long believed that French-made Ariane
rockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to track
with ground radar. Two years ago, however, an Ariane was launched
into an easy-to-track orbit and, Kessler said, ``it blew up after
nine months.'' The fragments of that explosion _ probably caused by
over pressurization of gases _ number 450.
   Americans and Soviets contribute to the space junk, too. Six
U.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded, the last in 1981 _ three
years after it was launched. The cause was leakage of fuels that
burn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models.
   Such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris _ ``a problem
analogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions
_ you can get hit from any direction and the most likely direction
will be head-on,'' Kessler said.
   The $1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbit
next year will operate 300 miles high. A study by the Space
Telescope Institute concluded the instrument should be designed
differently because of the debris, he said.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon of the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said 5,331 pieces of debris and 1,759 ``working
payloads'' were being tracked as of April 19. The objects ranged in
size from the Soviet Mir space station to a screwdriver dropped by
a spacewalking astronaut.
   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983
with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed the
culprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads.
   The few objects returned from space all have shown debris
damage. The Palapa and Westar satellites that were retrieved by a
space shuttle crew were pitted, but not damaged enough to keep them
from functioning. The Solar Max satellite, repaired in orbit,
showed many hits _ some penetrating an insulation blanket and
damaging the surface beneath.
   ``A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a
bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical
component, it would probably cause that system to cease
functioning,'' Kessler said. The average collision velocity would
be 22,000 mph, he said.
