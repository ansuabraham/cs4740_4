12-YEAR-OLD BOY WOWS EDUCATORS WITH TEST SCORES 




By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




A 12-year-old Camarillo boy was among three top scorers in California under age 
13 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and has been honored by Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. 


Jeffrey A. Smith was among 11 preteens nationally who were cited by the 
university for scoring at least 700 on the math portion and at least 630 on the 
verbal section of the test, said Angela James, talent search coordinator for 
the Johns Hopkins Center for the Advancement of Academically Talented Youth. 


Smith scored 1,360 of a possible 1,600 points on the exam, which measures a 
student's college preparedness. 


"It was pretty tricky," Smith said of the test, which has intimidated many high 
school juniors and seniors seeking high scores for college admission. 


"I had the most problems on reading comprehension but felt pretty comfortable 
on the science section," Smith said. He said his only preparation was taking 
the practice test in the SAT registration booklet. 


A seventh-grade student at Mesa Union School, Smith took the SAT in January 
with more than 46,000 other gifted students in 19 states and the District of 
Columbia. 


Johns Hopkins asked schools to choose their best students from among those who 
scored in the top 3% of standardized achievement or aptitude tests to take the 
SAT along with high school students, James said. Other universities conducted 
similar programs in the other states. 


Smith, who scored 630 on the verbal portion and 730 in math, won two $100 merit 
scholarships -- one each in math and English -- to be used toward accelerated 
summer programs that Johns Hopkins offers through several California colleges, 
including Redlands University in the Los Angeles area, James said. 


Clay Smith, Jeffrey's father, said he knew that Jeffrey is "pretty smart on the 
local level," but the family was pleasantly surprised that he had done so well 
nationally. Jeffrey has won his school's spelling bee for the past three years 
and also placed first in math and science earlier this year in the Camarillo 
Academic Olympics. 


He also participates in track and field and is an accomplished clarinetist who 
plays at local functions with a six-piece clarinet ensemble whose other members 
are high school students. 


Dennis J. Convery, superintendent of the one-school, 350-student Mesa Union 
Elementary School District, said Smith "excels in just about everything." 


Convery said the district is proud because Smith has been a student there since 
he was in kindergarten. "We feel that the learning that's taken place here, and 
being able to help him reach his potential and keep him challenged, is a 
reflection on the staff," he said. 


Smith said he has profited from the district's small size. "I like it," he 
said. "You get lots of personal involvement from the teachers, and you know 
everybody at the school." 


Smith said he would probably wait until his junior year in high school before 
taking the test again, and would try to score even higher. 


Despite his high SAT scores, Smith said he would not try to skip a grade or two 
and graduate ahead of his classmates. 


"Oh no," he said. "I wouldn't want to do that."

TRACK AND FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; 


DIMARCO'S ABLE STABLE CORRALS 2 MAJOR TITLES 




By John Ortega 




For someone who calls coaching a "throw-away profession" and who would like to 
"get the hell out of it," Charlie DiMarco of Northridge has had a great deal of 
success recently. 


Two of his proteges -- Walt Stewart of Cal State Northridge and Crissy Mills of 
Campbell Hall -- have won major high jump titles in the last two weeks. 


Stewart, a junior, won the NCAA Division II title with a leap of 7 feet, 1/2 
inch at Hampton, Va., on May 26, and Mills, a junior at the private high school 
in North Hollywood, won her second consecutive state championship with a 
personal-best jump of 6 feet at Cerritos College in Norwalk a week later. 


"The last two weeks have been very satisfying," DiMarco said. "It's nice to see 
your jumpers perform well in the big meets, to see them take what you worked on 
in practice and put it to use in competition." 


Despite his success, DiMarco has no intention of making coaching, or as he 
prefers to call it "consulting," a lifetime occupation. 


"I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life," said DiMarco, who has 
a full-time job at On Track, a track and field equipment manufacturer and 
distributor in Glendale. "There's just not enough money involved . . . . But it 
seems like I say that every year. I thought 1988 was going to be my last 
season, but then I decided to coach Crissy until the end of high school, which 
means 1990." 


After that, DiMarco projects that Mills will accept a college scholarship and 
get a new coach. However, Mills has hinted that she wants to stay in the area 
after her high school career so that DiMarco can coach her at the collegiate 
level. 


"She's an incredibly gifted athlete," he said. "It's just a matter of her 
continuing to improve her technique and strength." 


DiMarco, a pole vaulter who posted bests of 13-6 at Marshall High in 1976 and 
14-10 at Valley College two years later, was the field events coach at Valley 
from 1979-83 and at Cal State Northridge from 1984-86. 


At Northridge, he coached Dave Stephens, the 1984 NCAA Division II javelin 
champion and winner of last year's Olympic Trials. 


DiMarco's success created problems, however. 


"A lot of people would come to me and ask for help," DiMarco said. "And my 
natural reaction would be to help them. If someone asks me a question and I 
have knowledge about the subject, I'm going to tell them what I know." 


The problems arose because many of the people seeking DiMarco's advice were 
high school athletes, and as a college coach, he would be violating NCAA rules 
by coaching them. 


So he resigned his position at CSUN and formed Advantage Athletics, a 
Northridge-based club. 


The move allowed him to independently coach Northridge jumpers such as Stewart 
and Ken Burke, while also dealing with high school athletes like Mills. 


"It's been a good move," DiMarco said. "I don't have the patience to deal with 
all the politics of coaching at the collegiate level. The club has given me the 
chance to form my own little world of track and field. I have it just the way I 
want it." 


Statwatch: Russell White of Crespi High and Todd Lewis of Burbank failed to win 
titles in the triple jump and 1,600 meters, respectively, at the state 
championships last Saturday. 


But both athletes turned in top performances nonetheless. 


White, who placed third in the triple jump at 48 feet, 7 inches, bounded a 
Valley-area record of 50-6 in qualifying on Friday. Lewis finished third in the 
1,600 Saturday, but clocked a personal best of 4 minutes, 9.02 seconds. 


Lewis' time converts to a 4:10.47 mile, the fastest by a Valley-area runner 
since Agoura's Jon Stormo ran 4:10.2 in 1977. 


As swift as Lewis' time is, however, it ranks only second on the all-time 
Burbank list to John Musich, who ran 4:08.9 in 1974. Don Moses of Crescenta 
Valley set the Valley-area record of 4:08.5 in 1976.

PREP NOTES: VALENCIA HIGH NAMES BASKETBALL COACH 




Valencia High School has hired John Cyrus as its boys' basketball coach. 


Cyrus, who teaches at Valencia and is a tennis coach at Fullerton College, 
replaces Ray Rodriguez, who resigned after 14 years as coach to become an 
assistant basketball coach at Rancho Santiago College. 


Cyrus, a Valencia graduate, has served in various coaching positions at the 
school, including girls' basketball coach, assistant boys' basketball coach and 
assistant football coach. 


Rodriguez will remain at the school in a teaching position. 


Don Orr and Judy Moore have replaced Don Turnbull as boys' cross-country coach 
at Cypress High School, Turnbull said Tuesday. 


Orr, an economics teacher at the school and an assistant track coach, will team 
with Moore, the girls' track coach and physical education teacher, to coach the 
co-ed cross-country program. 


Turnbull, who in five years at the school led the Centurions to four Southern 
Section preliminaries and one final (1988), said he stepped down to pursue a 
career in event promotions. 




June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition 




FOR THE RECORD 


Cypress coach -- Judy Moore, a Cypress High School physical education teacher 
and assistant track coach, has replaced Jeff Scanlon as Cypress' head boys' and 
girls' track coach, and Marie Upton as head boys' and girls' cross-country 
coach, Cypress Athletic Director Rob Walker said Wednesday. 


Don Orr, a former head cross-country and track coach, will assist Moore in 
cross-country this fall. 


Information provided The Times Tuesday by former assistant coach Don Turnbull 
was erroneous.

COUNTY STUDENTS MISS THE CUT IN JUNIOR HIGH MATH COMPETITION 




By TOM McQUEENEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




FULLERTON 




The pencils were down, the tests collected and eighth-grader Laura Dietz sat 
recovering Saturday afternoon from Mathcounts, an all-day mathematics 
competition for California junior high school students. 


"I don't think I'm doing so well so far," said Laura, who attends Serrano 
Intermediate School in El Toro. "It's like, two things in a question and if you 
mess up on one, you're dead. They're real hard." 


She and 146 other junior high students from Southern California took several 
tests Saturday at Cal State Fullerton to find the top math student in the 
state. An identical competition was held simultaneously at St. Mary's College 
in Moraga for Northern Californians. 


When the winners were announced later in the afternoon, none of the 13 Orange 
County entrants had placed in the top four to garner a place on the state team. 


Robert Shih, 12, from Malaga Cove Intermediate School in Palos Verdes, placed 
No. 2 in the statewide competition, making him the only student from Southern 
California to qualify for the team that will go to the nationals. The three 
other top scorers were all from Northern California schools -- first-place 
winner Sean Trekhler from Palo Alto, E. Frey from Oakland (tied with Shih for 
second) and Arthur Shek from Carmichael (third place). The California team will 
go on to compete May 18 in Washington. 


Mathcounts, sponsored by the National Society of Professional Engineers, is 
aimed at showing students that math can be fun, said Cliff Ishii, a Cypress 
engineer and state director of the competition. The sponsors hope that by 
getting junior high students interested in math, they will continue taking math 
and science in high school and college and become engineers. 


Before the final scores were announced, Eric Weiss, an eighth-grader from 
Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine, said he hoped he wouldn't score in 
the top 10. Top scorers had to go one-on-one in a videotaped quiz round with 
the other top students. 


"I'm getting sick thinking about it," he said, shortly after eating a 
hamburger. 


The Orange County students competing Saturday qualified for the statewide event 
after winning a countywide contest in February. Four-member teams from Serrano, 
Rancho San Joaquin and La Paz Intermediate in Mission Viejo outscored all other 
county schools. 


An eighth-grader from Los Alisos Intermediate School in Mission Viejo, Jae Lee, 
14, participated Saturday as an individual because he was the top-scoring 
student in the county. 


During the competition, students received questions in a series of rounds. The 
first round hit them with 30 questions that had to be completed in 40 minutes. 
The second round subjected them to questions given in pairs with eight minutes 
to solve them. 


The questions were designed to test knowledge that junior high math students 
would typically be exposed to, said Joan Gell, a math teacher at Palos Verdes 
High School who helped write the test, which is being used by all students 
across the country. 


A sample question: Jack and Jill are siblings. Jill has twice as many brothers 
as sisters. Jack has the same number of brothers as sisters. How many children 
are in the family? 


As each round began, competitors flipped over test booklets at speeds 
approaching Mach 1. Then brows furrowed and erasers were chewed as the 
basketball game timer on the wall ticked away the seconds remaining. 


"One careless error and you get a handshake instead of a trophy," said Beverly 
Mairs, the coach from Malaga Cove Intermediate School. 


The contest is meant to be competitive, Ishii said. But the real goal of the 
event, besides having fun, is to increase the number of engineers in the 
country, he said. 


His company recruits about half of its engineers from outside the United 
States, he said, mostly from Korea. 


"We're not seeing the kids (in the United States) take the math at the level 
they need," he said. "We need to encourage them because we need more home-grown 
talent." 


After the contest was over, Michael D. Cowan, chairman of the Orange County 
chapter of Mathcounts, posed a final math question to all those within earshot: 


"How do 147 kids go through 200 hamburgers and 236 candy bars when they were 
allowed only one each?" 


Carole Jackson, the math coach for Irvine's team, beat him to the punch line. 


"They have two hands," she said. "That's an easy one. Ask any junior high 
school teacher."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 


REGION'S FOOTBALL TEAMS HAVE SEEN HIGH TURNOVER 




The coaching turnover trend continues at a high rate in Southeast/Long 
Beach-area high schools this fall. One-third of the area's 39 head coaching 
positions have been vacated since last year. In the past six years, 69 jobs 
have changed hands. 


Some of the more interesting changes for 1989: 


* Bellflower High will not have a head coach. 


* Artesia's Norm Flowers has the head job after sharing it last season. 


* Three head coaches in other sports have been given extra duties as football 
coaches. 


* Wayne Manzo jumps from Cerritos to La Serna. 


Bellflower thought it had solved its vacancy when it hired Jim Wright from a 
high school in Arizona. But Wright had second thoughts. Football practice 
opened without a coach, and school officials now say the Bucs will be handled 
by three assistants. 


Tom Tereschuk (baseball) of California, Mark Rose (track) of Lakewood and 
Harold Eggers (boys volleyball) of Cerritos have all been appointed to 
additional roles as head football coaches. 


The naming of Flowers at Artesia is the third coaching change in three seasons 
for the Pioneers. 


Manzo joins former Cerritos baseball coach Vern Brock at La Serna. Brock is the 
school's athletic director and baseball coach. 


Two trends remain fairly constant: St. Anthony has a new coach (Ralph Godfrey) 
for the seventh time this decade. Ken Davis, dean of area coaches, begins his 
18th season at Schurr. 


The number of coaching changes in the Southeast/Long Beach area is higher than 
in other areas of Southern California. Orange County, which has 28 schools, 
loses five to seven coaches a season, most from firings, according to figures 
compiled by The Times. This fall eight new coaches debut in the San Fernando 
Valley, which has about 50 schools. In other areas the turnover rate averages 
about 10%. 


Coaches in the Long Beach/Southeast area often cite burnout, the desire to move 
on to more prestigious positions, long hours and substandard pay as reasons for 
leaving.

TRW TO DONATE $1 MILLION FOR MATH, SCIENCE SCHOOL 




By ELAINE WOO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Concerned about a projected serious shortfall of well-educated workers by the 
year 2000, TRW Inc., the Redondo Beach-based producer of aerospace and 
automotive products and information systems, announced Wednesday that it will 
donate $1 million over the next 10 years to help establish a special math and 
science high school on the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. 


Called the California Academy of Mathematics and Science, the comprehensive 
high school is a joint project of the California State University system and 
the Long Beach and Compton school districts. Scheduled to open in the fall of 
1990, it will draw students from throughout the Los Angeles Basin, 
concentrating in particular on women and minorities. Teachers will be recruited 
from local school districts, universities and private industry. 


Cal State officials said the school will be the first of its kind in the state, 
offering accelerated math and science courses as part of a comprehensive high 
school curriculum that could enable students to enroll as college sophomores 
upon graduation. 


"I'm here to make an investment in my company's future," Edsel D. Dunford, 
executive vice president and general manager of TRW's space and defense sector, 
said at a news conference at the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus in Carson. 


The high school's basic funding will come from the state, which finances 
kindergarten- through-12th-grade education on a per-pupil basis. TRW will 
provide $100,000 a year over the next decade, and academy officials said they 
are counting on receiving similar donations from other local aerospace, 
engineering and computer firms to help offset the higher costs of running a 
specialized school. 


Academy Principal Kathy Clark said the four-year high school will offer 
educational experiences that are difficult to obtain at regular high schools, 
including opportunities to collaborate on research projects with university 
faculty and work-study relationships with "mentors" in private industry. All 
students will study biology, chemistry and earth sciences each year, another 
departure from the typical high school curriculum. 


The academy initially will recruit from 60 schools in the Torrance, Inglewood, 
Lawndale, Los Angeles, Compton and Long Beach school districts. Clark said the 
school will aim for a student body that is 60% to 70% black and Latino. It will 
open with 100 ninth-graders and have a total enrollment of 500 by 1993. 


Transportation -- which has been a problem for the Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts, the only other countywide specialized high school -- will 
be provided to the academy, she added. Students must arrange their own 
transportation to the arts school, located on the Cal State Los Angeles campus. 


The math and science academy had been controversial because of the Compton 
school district's fears that it would drain away its best students. But academy 
officials agreed to draw no more than two students from each school except with 
the school district's approval and to recruit students who may lack good grades 
but who show potential. 


California State University Chancellor Ann Reynolds said American students lag 
behind their counterparts in most other industrialized nations in math and 
science ability and that the record is particularly dismal among women and 
minorities. Last year, for instance, the nation's colleges and universities 
produced only one black and three Latino Ph.D. holders in math, Reynolds said. 
By the year 2000, the nation faces a shortage of 500,000 math and science 
professionals. 


Noting that junior high school is where most students lose interest in the 
subjects, Reynolds said, "We're very eager to correct the lost momentum in 
science and math education in this country."

YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE PROBLEMATIC FOR CITY SECTION PROGRAMS 




By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




A proposal that would place all schools in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District on a year-round calendar could wreak havoc with high school athletics 
schedules, according to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness. 


The Board of Education will consider Monday an overcrowding relief plan that 
was proposed by Supt. Leonard Britton at last Monday's meeting. Under the plan, 
which would take effect in 1991, schools would operate on the "90/30" calendar 
that puts students in school for three months -- or 90 days -- then on vacation 
for a month. 


The plan also lays the groundwork for the district to adopt a multi-track, 
year-round operation, which is inevitable, according to Britton. A multi-track 
plan divides the student body into groups and creates more classroom space 
because one group of students is on vacation at all times. 


But because not all schools face immediate overcrowding conditions -- 
particularly high schools in the Valley -- schools would be allowed to start 
the program on a single-track calendar with all students operating on the same 
schedule. 


Harkness emphasized that the needs of athletics pale in comparison to the 
concerns that overcrowding presents to the district. He also said that it is 
too soon to draw contingency plans, citing the possibility that the measure 
might not gain board approval. 


But Harkness claimed that a single-track calendar that calls for two monthlong 
vacations -- one in the summer and the other during the traditional school year 
-- could disrupt high school athletics schedules. The closure of a school 
during a sports season could present logistical problems of nightmarish 
proportions, Harkness said. 


"When a school is closed, there are no students, coaches, teachers, 
administrators, support staff, there is no one there," Harkness said. "The 
place is dark. 


"During the summer, when you don't have any programs, there's no problem, but 
when you have programs, that's a calamity." 


Currently, Bell, Belmont, Huntington Park and South Gate follow a year-round 
calendar under a three-track system in which two-thirds of the student body is 
always in school. A student must attend practices and games while on vacation 
if the vacation coincides with the season of a sport he or she wants to play. 


Harkness claims that the system works well at those schools, saying the only 
significant consequence is the phasing out of two-sport coaches. 


"If you want to coach a sport in the fall and the spring, there's no way you're 
not going to put some off-track time in," he said.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 


TITANS ALLOW ELDERS TO RUN WITH HIS DREAM 




By Barbie Ludovise 




John Elders had that queasy feeling as he walked into the office of Ed Carroll, 
Cal State Fullerton athletic director, last July. Elders, the Titans' 
cross-country coach, couldn't imagine why Carroll had asked to see him. 


"I thought I was in trouble or something," Elders said. 


No trouble. Carroll told Elders that the university had decided to revive the 
men's track and field program, which had been virtually nonexistent since 1981. 


And the head coaching job was Elders', if he wanted it. 


The offer was a dream come true for Elders, a Fullerton graduate and a former 
distance runner at Villa Park High School and Rancho Santiago College. 
Something in the realm of a sub-4-minute mile -- a great challenge, but worth 
fighting for. 


"I vowed to make it a successful program," he said. "And I'll work as hard as I 
can to make it happen." 


If Elders, at 26 one of the youngest Division I coaches in the country, manages 
to make the Titans' track and field program a big success, he would be the 
first. Although Fullerton once had a strong men's cross-country program, 
winning the Division II title in 1972, track has been an on-and-off operation 
in recent years. 


In 1975, the men's track program was dropped when Fullerton became a Division I 
school. Hurdles were sold and long jump and pole vault pits were torn out to 
make room for a football field. 


(Women's track and men's and women's cross-country have always remained, though 
none of these programs have had much success in recent years). 


In 1981, men's track was reinstated when Jim Crumpton, a Corona del Mar High 
School track coach, offered to do some fund raising. After two years, Crumpton 
left. Since then, men's track has operated basically as a club sport at 
Fullerton. 


Bob Messina, coach of the UCLA women's distance programs, spent the 1983 and 
1984 seasons coaching at Fullerton. Messina said he has many fond memories of 
Fullerton, though financial support for the program was always a problem. 


"They told me when I went there that there was a $500 budget," Messina said. 
"What they didn't tell me was I was the one who had to raise it." 


For Elders, Fullerton's future in men's track appears brighter. Fullerton has 
granted Elders a $5,000 budget for the 1989 season, a substantial increase from 
last season. 


"Last year we got $236 for men's cross-country," Elders said. "That was the 
exact amount to pay our phone bill." 


Elders, who teaches part time at Fullerton High School, said his coaching 
salary will increase from $12,000 to $25,000 next year. 


But the brightest spot in the Titan track future would have to be the $6.7 
million on-campus sports complex. Construction is scheduled to begin this 
summer. 


Along with a 10,000-seat football stadium, the complex will include a 
1,500-seat baseball pavilion and a soccer field, an eight-lane, all-weather, 
lighted track with surrounding bleacher seating for 3,000. The track portion is 
scheduled to be competed by the spring of 1991. 


There are only five all-weather track facilities in Orange County: at UC 
Irvine, Irvine High School, and Rancho Santiago, Saddleback, Golden West and 
Fullerton community colleges. 


The new Fullerton track should be a great boost to recruiting. As should the 
ever-enthusiastic Elders and his assistants, Ben Brown and Jim Stuart. Mark 
O'Brien, a graduate assistant, helps with the distance program. 


Brown, a gold medalist in the 1976 Olympics in the 1,600-meter relay and a 
former NCAA 400-meter champion for UCLA, helped Messina coach the Fullerton 
program in 1983. He returned when he heard the program was restarting. 


Stuart was the Titans' cross-country coach from 1986-88, and Elders was his 
assistant. But family commitments forced Stuart to give up the position last 
year, so Elders took over. 


Elders said he has about 40 athletes -- 20 men, 20 women -- signed up for the 
men's and women's track and field teams. Although most of the men are distance 
runners from the cross-country team, Fullerton will field some quality 
sprinters, including football players Mike Pringle, Mark Hill and Chip Grant. 


Pringle, a junior, was All-City Section in track for Kennedy High School in 
Granada Hills. Hill, who has 4.6 speed in the 40, was the Bay League 400-meter 
champion at Santa Monica High. And Grant, a freshman, is said to have the best 
speed of the three -- his 40 speed is listed as "4.5 or less" in the Titan 
football guide. 


But what does Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy think of his players taking 
to the track? 


"Oh, it's fine with me, as long as they know where their priorities are," 
Murphy said. "First is books, second is football, and third is track. If they 
can take care of No. 1 and 2 then 3's OK. 


"But if it comes between football and track, it has to be football. They're on 
football scholarships here." 


At UC Irvine, track and field Coach Vince O'Boyle is welcoming the Fullerton 
track and field revival with encouraging words -- despite the fact that 
Fullerton will compete against Irvine in the Big West Conference. 


"I think it's great for track and field in all aspects," O'Boyle said. "I'm 
excited about it. It'll help all of our programs around here to have more 
competition. I'm happy for them, especially that they have somebody there 
trying to put it in right direction." 


Perhaps coincidentally, Elders said he hopes to emulate O'Boyle in building the 
Titan program. 


Fullerton has yet to name a search committee for the basketball coaching job. 
However, some indication of the qualities athletic director Ed Carroll is 
seeking in a coach can be drawn from the job description that has been posted. 
The qualifications listed make it clear that a commitment to academics and 
"desire and ability" to raise funds will be important. Those are two areas in 
which former Coach George McQuarn was criticized by the athletic department. 


Brent Mayne is a year older and 20 pounds heavier this season, and baseball 
Coach Larry Cochell is expecting a fine season from the junior catcher. He's 
also expecting it to be Mayne's last. 


"We won't have him next year. We know that," Cochell said. He predicts Mayne 
will go very high in the June amateur draft, probably in the first round. Mayne 
hit .393 last season and had a 38-game hitting streak.

CLEVELAND PUTS TRACK TEAMS ON HOLD, OFFERS ALTERNATIVE 




By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




After a fruitless two-month search for a qualified coach, Cleveland High has 
canceled its track season. However, athletes at the school who wish to 
participate in the sport do have recourse if they are willing to triple-jump 
through a series of obstacles that ultimately could lead to eligibility at 
another school. 


The program was canceled when a replacement for Steve Landress, a last-minute 
replacement a year ago, could not be found. Last month, Landress, the school's 
football coach, was named junior varsity baseball coach, leaving school 
administrators scrambling to find a new track coach. 


While the boys' and girls' programs were headed toward limbo, school 
administrators worked out a plan whereby track athletes at Cleveland can 
participate at a another City Section school with a track program -- if several 
provisions are met. 


According to Bob Kindseth, Cleveland's administrator in charge of athletics, 
the athlete would need permission of both principals and the coach at the 
second school, would be required to enroll in a sixth-period physical-education 
course at the new school and would have to provide his or her own 
transportation. 


"Feasibly, he could go to any school (with a track program)," Kindseth said. 
"It's not easy, but it can be done." 


Whether the athlete will be welcomed by his new coach is another matter. 
Kindseth said that the athlete would be able to participate but that any points 
earned would not count for his or her new team. Kindseth conceded that, in 
events in which limits are set regarding the number of entrants per school, 
coaches might be hesitant to enter a non-scoring athlete. 


So far, Kindseth said, only one Cleveland athlete has inquired about the 
possibility of competing elsewhere. 


According to Principal Ida Mae Windham, the school sought only credentialed 
applicants from throughout the L. A. Unified School District for the track 
position. 


A credentialed teacher was sought, Windham said, because of expertise required 
to supervise and train athletes in a track program. 


Windham said that Cleveland will continue to seek a coach capable of 
re-establishing the program next season. 


Landress, who last season was the third track coach in as many years, said he 
believes student interest in track might be waning -- or at the very least, 
that participation has been curtailed by a variety of factors. Last season, the 
boys' and girls' track teams combined numbered about 40, Landress said. 


"It takes a lot of money to run a track program, and a lot of schools just 
don't have the budget for that," Landress said. "And track is a different kind 
of sport where it takes a lot of different coaches because there are so many 
different events." 


However, Landress predicted that the recent relaxing of City Section 
eligibility requirements might give track a shot in the arm. Under the revised 
district rule, students participating in extracurricular activities -- 
including sports -- need only maintain a C average to remain eligible.

MACK TO COACH TRACK AT LOYOLA NEXT SEASON 




By STEVE ELLING 




After serving as track coach at two Del Rey League high schools in the past two 
seasons, Alemany's Jon Mack made it three for three Friday when he accepted an 
offer to coach at Loyola High. 


Mack, 28, has coached six high school All-Americans in a nine-year career that 
includes eight years at Notre Dame and one at Alemany. 


Mack will finish the school year at Alemany and begin at Loyola in September. 
He will teach biology and also serve as an assistant football coach at Loyola. 


Mack's teams have compiled a 58-15-1 dual-meet record and four times have 
finished the season in the Southern Section 2-A Division top 10. Loyola, an 
all-boys school with an enrollment of 1,100, won this season's Del Rey League 
championship. STEVE ELLING

PEOPLE: COLLEGE COUNSELOR PEDALS FAST TO KEEP TRACK OF ATHLETES' ACADEMIC 
PROGRESS 




By LEE HARRIS 




Virginia Romero rides a bike to get around the 140-acre Cerritos College campus 
and perform her job as athletic counselor. 


She uses the bicycle so she can move quickly to solve any academic problems 
involving the 545 student athletes at the school, Romero said. 


"I might have to take a transcript to a coach to let him know immediately how a 
player is doing," Romero said. "I might want to talk with an athlete at the gym 
during a class break." 


Other times, Romero can be found huddled in her small, cramped space in the 
admissions office, counseling students or talking on the telephone with coaches 
or counselors from other colleges and high schools. 


Romero is one of only 12 athletic counselors in the state's 107-community 
college system. She is the only one in the Southeast area. 


The college's seven-member board of trustees appointed Romero to the athlete 
counseling job in August. "The board is committed to ensuring the success of 
our athletes as students," said Mark Wallace, director of public information. 


Romero said her job is to make sure athletes are taking the proper classes and 
maintaining a 2.0 grade-point average to graduate from the two-year school and 
transfer to four-year colleges. 


"All students are special, but athletes need special attention to achieve as 
students and fulfill their athletic obligation," Romero said. 


She said athletes need special attention because 90% of them work part time 
while carrying 15 units and practicing three to four hours daily in their 
chosen sport. 


In the next couple of months, Romero said she will be setting up a computerized 
program to keep track of the athletes' academic progress. She also plans to 
schedule workshops with high school coaches and counselors to prepare student 
athletes for the rigors of college life. 


Before Romero took her present position, she taught health and physical 
education classes at Cerritos College for 11 years. Previously, she coached 
high school athletics in the ABC Unified School District. 


She attended Cerritos College and has a bachelor's degree in physical education 
from Cal State Long Beach. She also has a master's degree in counseling from 
Cal Lutheran University. 


Long Beach City College has honored 21 of its 700 part-time instructors for 
having taught at the college for more than 20 years. Five of them were featured 
recently in the school's newsletter. 


Joe Apfel has been teaching business at the college since 1957. Apfel is 
retired. He was a teacher for 33 years in the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 


Carl Wulfsberg also teaches business classes at the college. He retired from 
Long Beach Unified in 1987 as a high school counselor. 


Math instructor Lois Barth has taught at the 30,000-student college for more 
than 20 years on a part-time basis, while working full time as a junior high 
school math teacher in the Long Beach unified district. 


Art instructor Joan Binkoff joined the college in 1966. An art designer, 
Binkoff has exhibited her prints, photographs and drawings throughout the 
country. 


Don Hopkins is the evening dean at the college. Hopkins is a former 
administrator in the Long Beach Unified School District. He was there for 36 
years, teaching woodworking and math at both the district and the college 
before going into administration. 


* Tim Keeler, executive director of local cable TV Channel 53, has been honored 
by the Whittier branch of the American Assn. of University Women. Keeler was 
given a certificate of appreciation for helping the branch produce "Care Giving 
-- You Are Alone," a 15-minute video on health care and convalescent facilities 
for the elderly in the Whittier area. Keeler provided training and editing 
assistance to the branch members during a two-year period when the video was 
being made. 


* Whittier resident Deborah Lopez has been hired as an administrative assistant 
in the Personnel and Redevelopment Department for the city of Pico Rivera. 
Lopez has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Whittier College and is 
seeking a master's degree in public administration from Cal State Long Beach. 


* Long Beach resident William V. Davidson has been selected chairman of the 
19-member board of trustees for Chadwick School, a small private college 
preparatory school on the Palos Verdes Peninsula that serves kindergarten 
through 12th-grade students. A graduate of Chadwick and USC's law school, 
Davidson is general partner of the Davidson Group, a Long Beach industrial real 
estate development company. 


* Cal State Long Beach associate professor Michael Agopian has been appointed 
chief deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the U.S. 
Department of Justice by President George Bush. The bureau is responsible for 
collecting, analyzing and disseminating crime statistics. 


* Marina Anaya has received the Toastmasters Communication Achievement Award. 
Anaya is the newly appointed assistant superintendent of schools for curriculum 
for the Whittier Union High School District. Anaya introduced Toastmasters 
youth leadership programs to several hundred students at Santa Fe and Pioneer 
high schools, where she was an administrator before being promoted. The 
students received training in public speaking and leadership skills. 


* Patrick Wong recently won second place in architectural drafting in the 
community colleges Skills Olympics at Tulsa, Okla. Wong graduated from Rio 
Hondo College in June. He is studying urban and regional planning at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 


* Nine Holmes Elementary School students have received awards and money for 
posters they produced during a recent fire prevention contest sponsored by the 
Los Angeles City Housing Authority for residents of public housing projects. 
The students live at the Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project near Huntington Park. 
First-place winners received $50, second place $30 and third place $20. First 
place winners were Saloeun Srey, Sinoun Von and Saroeum Chan. Kasol Dith, David 
Thoeun and Rattana Samart were second. Saphalla Heu, her twin sister, Sophaolly 
Heu, and Leng Tung were third. LEE HARRIS

PANEL ISSUES PLAN TO CHANGE WAY MATH IS TAUGHT 




From Associated Press 




WASHINGTON 




The nation's math teachers on Tuesday released standards designed to make sure 
pupils learn to explore and reason as well as add, subtract, multiply and 
divide. 


"Our children are internationally competitive in ... arithmetical skills," said 
John Dossey, chairman of the standards commission of the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics. "It is in the application of mathematics in geometry, 
measurement and data analysis where our students are falling short." 


Dossey, a math professor at Illinois State University, cited studies showing 
basic skills have improved over the past 20 years. "Yet today only about 
one-half of American 17-year-olds can say whether 87 percent of 10 is less than 
10, greater than 10 or equal to 10," or figure out how much carpet is needed to 
cover a floor, he said. 


The council's curriculum and evaluation standards, a collection of 54 
guidelines for kindergarten through high school, were three years in the making 
and aim to raise the level of applied math skills. 


"Applied mathematics is not just for a couple of geniuses in the country," said 
Sally Ride, a Stanford University physicist and former astronaut who appeared 
at a news conference with the math teachers. 


She said the new standards should make applied math accessible to all students 
but teachers, parents and students "will have more work to do. The country is 
going to have to make it a higher priority." 


Generally, the standards seek to ensure that students value math, become 
confident in their abilities, solve problems, and learn to communicate and to 
reason mathematically.

CITY 4-A BASEBALL PLAYOFFS CANCELED BECAUSE OF BOYCOTT BY COACHES 




By JOHN LYNCH 




City Section officials Tuesday canceled their 4-A Division high school baseball 
playoffs, scheduled to start today, because of a coaches' boycott stemming from 
the teachers' strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District. 


The 3-A Division playoffs will start today as scheduled, Commissioner Hal 
Harkness said. 


Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the 16 schools whose teams 
had qualified revealed that only six were willing to field teams without the 
coach of record. Harkness declined to name the schools. District rules dictate 
that the school official coaching a team must be a credentialed employee. 


Despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn. that teachers 
honoring picket lines continue to coach their teams, a group of 18 4-A coaches 
voted last week to boycott the season until the strike ends. 


Playoffs have continued in all other spring sports -- golf, gymnastics, 
softball, swimming, track and volleyball. JOHN LYNCH

ROGER SIMON: MATH ADDS UP TO LIFE'S BIGGEST PROBLEM 




By ROGER SIMON 




We all know we will never need the math we studied in school. Math is something 
they made us study because school is designed to torture the young. 


And only by torturing the young do we prepare them for real life. 


I am out at one of those discount shopping malls, one based on the concept that 
people will burn $10 worth of gasoline driving to a place where they can save 
$7 on a pair of shoes. 


Which is why I am there. I have found my shoes and only one woman is ahead of 
me in line. The woman has found a scuffed pair of shoes and is asking the girl 
behind the counter if she can get a bigger discount. 


The girl is wearing a name tag that says "Jeanne" and she cannot be more than 
15. She picks up the phone and talks to the manager and then puts down the 
phone. 


"He says you get 10% off," Jeanne says. 


"That's fine," says the woman. 


Now Jeanne begins rummaging under the counter, pulling things from a shelf down 
there and piling them up on the countertop: scissors, a ball of string, papers, 
rubber bands, invoice books. 


"There's no calculator," Jeanne finally says in a voice close to tears. 
"There's s'posed to be a calculator. I can't do 10% in my head." 


The woman waiting for the 10% discount stands there. I stand there. 


"Barry," Jeanne shouts over to the kid at the next counter, who looks about 16. 
"Do you have the calculator?" 


"No," Barry says, "I think Ray has it and he's, like, spaced somewhere." 


Jeanne now sighs a big, stagey sigh and lets her shoulders slump. She pokes 
through the junk on the counter one more time. "I can't do 10% in my head," she 
says again. 


The woman looks at her and then looks at me. 


I should explain that I was never any good at math. My SAT scores in math were 
so low that during my college interviews the interviewers said things like, 
"Did you leave the room halfway through?" or "Are you sure you understood the 
concept of multiple choice?" 


But I managed to get into college, anyway, and then I became an adult and, 
therefore, no longer needed math. 


Except that as a reporter, I found I needed math all the time. I found I needed 
math on police stories: if the gunman entered the bank at 4:17 p.m. and the 
hostages were not released until 1:02 a.m, how long were they held captive? 


I found I needed math on tax stories: If the average county tax bill was 
$3,334.47 last year and this year it's $4,567.29, by what percentage did it 
increase? 


I found I needed math, in fact, on all kinds of stories. So slowly and 
painfully I had to learn in real life what I had not learned in school. 


Which is exactly what my teachers had told me. "Mr. Simon! If you don't stop 
gazing out that window you will slowly and painfully have to learn some day 
what you are not learning right now!" 


But who listened to teachers? If they were so smart, how come they weren't 
making more money? 


Today, I am no math wizard. But I can do 10% in my head. 


Just like a whole bunch of you can. Depending on when you went to school, that 
is. If you went in the olden, low-tech days, they taught you such things. 
Today, school is much fancier. 


"How much are the shoes?" I asked Jeanne. 


"Uh, $28.86," she said. 


"So you give her $2.89 off," I said. 


"Really?" Jeanne said, as if I had, perhaps, chosen the numbers at random. 
"That's excellent!" She turned to the woman. "Is that OK with you?" 


The woman nodded. "Sounds right," she said. 


Jeanne rang up the discount -- the cash register did the subtraction for her -- 
and the woman walked off happy. 


While Jeanne was ringing up my shoes, I talked to her. 


You in high school? I asked. 


"Sure," Jeanne said, concentrating on the numbers she was punching. 


"I'm not trying to make you feel bad or anything because I was lousy in math 
when I was in high school," I said. "But don't they teach you about decimals 
and percentages in school?" 


"In school," Jeanne said, "we get to use calculators." 


But of course they do. And why wouldn't they? Machines will do everything for 
us, won't they? 


Perhaps there are still some schools that do not allow kids to use calculators. 
And in those schools I am sure every day the kids moan and whine and say: "Why 
do we have to learn this decimal junk? When we grow up, we're going to use 
calculators anyway." 


And I know what teachers say back. They talk about the satisfaction of learning 
mathematical principles and the joy of conquering difficult concepts and the 
pride you can take in having mental tools that will last a lifetime. 


But teachers should not bother saying such things. 


Instead, they should tell the truth. 


They should say: "You have to learn this stuff because some day Ray may walk 
off with the calculator and get absolutely spaced."

CLASSES FOR FUTURE NOBEL WINNERS; 


EDUCATION: SPECIALTY SCHOOLS HAVE LONG OFFERED INNOVATIVE MATH AND SCIENCE 
PROGRAMS FOR TOP-NOTCH STUDENTS. NOW SOME ARE BROADENING THEIR ADMISSION 
POLICIES. 




By ANNE C. ROARK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Ask any prominent American scientist or mathematician where he or she went to 
high school and you're likely to hear one of two places: Bronx High School of 
Science or Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. 


Between them, these two New York public high schools have graduated half a 
dozen Nobel Prize winners. In their more than 100 years of operation, they have 
by most measures educated more top-echelon scientists and mathematicians than 
any other schools in the United States, public or private. 


While these schools, with their innovative curricula and highly gifted 
students, have become a subject of enormous scrutiny and controversy in recent 
years because they systematically exclude the vast majority of students, there 
are many scientists and educators who extol high-powered specialty science high 
schools as one of the most important solutions to the nation's growing problems 
in science and math. 


Only by identifying "the best and the brightest students" in a city or region 
and giving them "heavy doses of science and math at an early age" can the 
nation hope "to avert a crisis in science and technology," argued Nobel 
laureate Glenn T. Seaborg. 


Seaborg, the son of poor, Swedish immigrants, began his scientific education at 
David Starr Jordan High School in Watts in the 1920s. He managed to rise above 
his humble educational beginnings to go on to be a member of the Manhattan 
Project, chancellor of UC Berkeley, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission and winner of the 1940 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of 
plutonium. But his early schooling was not, he said, "the sort of beginning 
anyone can count on to produce a scientist or mathematician." 


Believing as Seaborg does that highly competitive specialty schools may be 
among the best and most reliable places to produce world-class researchers and 
inventors, many states over the last decade have been creating new schools 
modeled after Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. 


In 1980, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, the country's 
first public boarding school, opened in Durham. In 1982, another public 
boarding school, the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, opened in 
Natchitoches, La. In 1985, a regional public day school, the Thomas Jefferson 
High School, a Governor's School for Science and Technology, opened in 
Alexandria, Va. on the outskirts of Washington. In 1986, the Illinois 
Mathematics and Science Academy began operations in Auroa, Ill., outside 
Chicago. 


Two years ago, the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics 
was created in Hartsville, S.C., and the Mississippi School for Mathematics and 
Science started in Columbus, Miss. Just this fall, California opened its first 
public, competitive science and math high school, the California Academy of 
Mathematics and Science at Cal State Dominguez Hills, near Long Beach. 


"These schools do not represent what's going on in the rest of the country, but 
they do represent our best hope for the future," said E. G. Sherburne Jr., 
publisher of Science News magazine and president of Science Service Inc., which 
administers the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, a prestigious nationwide 
competition for teen-age students of science. 


"The reason these schools work is quite simple," said Abe Baumel, who has been 
principal of Stuyvesant for more than two decades. 


And despite what most people think, it has nothing to do with the 
qualifications of teachers or the quality of equipment or even the design of 
the curriculum. 


"Look at this place," Baumel said. "The building is as old and broken down as I 
am. We have one chemistry lab and one physics lab, and they are both in 
abominable shape. The equipment is older than I am -- and in worse shape. The 
oak tables date back to 1904. The machine tools are so obsolete, they belong in 
the Smithsonian." 


The key to the success of a school is simply a matter of the quality of the 
student body. 


"It's the kids," Baumel said. "They're incredible. . . . There is a joke that 
it's harder to get in here than it is to get into Harvard. But it's no joke. 


"When you bring a group of these kids together, when you get a critical mass of 
them in one place, magic starts to happen." 


While not wanting to dilute this magic in any way, many of the specialty 
schools -- old as well as new -- are trying to reach out to students who might 
not ordinarily be expected to excel in science and math. 


Bronx Science, for example, has begun a special admissions programs for 
disadvantaged students and summer classes for students in regular public high 
schools who are interested in science and math, but who do not score high 
enough on entrance exams to be admitted to the regular academic program. 


Thomas Jefferson has been trying to devise entirely new admissions criteria 
that emphasize motivation and grades rather than scores on standardized 
admissions tests. And the California Academy of Mathematics and Science has 
insisted on recruiting its first class not just from the top 1% or 2% of the 
student population but from the top 25%, drawing no more than two or three from 
each of 60 feeder schools in Los Angeles's South Bay. 


The result is that nearly 70% of the 116 entering freshmen are members of 
under-represented minority groups -- blacks, Latinos, Cambodians, Vietnamese -- 
and over half are female. 


Most specialty schools have been able to get as many as 80% of their graduates 
to pursue scientific careers, said Kathy Clark, principal of the new academy. 
"If we get anywhere close to that and yet serve the kind of population we are 
serving, surely we will have proved something very important."

areas. Above, T.C. Cheng works on a math problem at Nogales High School in La

CITY BASEBALL COACHES TO BOYCOTT GAMES IN EVENT OF STRIKE 




By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 




A group of City Section baseball coaches said Thursday that they would honor 
picket lines and boycott the conclusion of the regular season next week if 
teachers carry out a proposed strike against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 


The group of 11 coaches also joined United Teachers-Los Angeles in criticizing 
the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn., which has recommended that coaches in all 
spring sports continue to supervise their teams even if they participate in the 
strike set for Monday. 


The position of the coaches' association was unanimously approved by 19 
representatives from the 49 City high schools at an emergency meeting Wednesday 
at Belmont High. The recommendation conforms to a directive issued this week by 
the district, which has reversed its field since the last strike 19 years ago 
when coaches who participated in the walkout were forced to the sidelines. 


The coaches' association gave its recommendation at the same time the baseball 
coaches struck their position. After a seeding meeting for the City 4-A 
Division playoffs, the coaches agreed to honor picket lines. They also said 
that they will meet Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs if a strike is not 
averted. Baseball playoffs begin May 24. The district plans no change in its 
athletics schedule and has devised no contingency plan in the event of a 
strike. 


The union endorsed the baseball coaches and urged the association to change its 
stance. 


"We're proud of the baseball coaches who took the right stand and are 
disappointed in the other coaches," union representative Helen Bernstein said. 
"I hope they change their minds. I just don't think they understood the impact 
this would have on their colleagues. We're urging the same thing for all 
activities, including band and drama. It's not fair to make exceptions for one 
group." 


Association President Paul Knox, the Dorsey High football and track coach, 
lists himself as a strong union supporter. Like most coaches, he has examined 
his loyalties this week, weighing his ties to his colleagues against those to 
his players. He said that he will strike Monday but will cross picket lines to 
coach his athletes in next week's City track semifinals. 


"We were trying to come up with something that everyone could live with," he 
said. "This is only a recommendation, not a mandate. We're trying now to get 
this information out to every school so that this position can be explained. We 
don't want people to think we're deliberately doing something detrimental to 
the strike." 


Some already have reached that conclusion. Chatsworth baseball Coach Bob 
Lofrano, the vice president of the coaches association, attended the seeding 
meeting instead of the association's emergency meeting. He questioned the right 
of the association to make recommendations without consulting more coaches. 


"How could they make that decision without having a vote of the rank and file?" 
he said. "This is an individual thing, but we don't want coaches to sit on both 
sides of the fence. You have to strike as a teacher and a coach. I don't know 
how you can differentiate between the two." 


Baseball coaches have criticized the district's stance, saying that the 
directive was designed to shift parental complaints if sports events are 
canceled from the board to the coaches and to undermine union solidarity. Board 
and district officials have rejected those charges, saying that the move was 
made with the interests of students in mind. 


Chatsworth volleyball Coach Steve Berk said that he would urge the other three 
coaches whose teams remain alive in the 4-A Division playoffs to honor picket 
lines next week at the expense of the semifinal and final rounds. 


"I'd love to play and the kids haven't come all this way for nothing. But I 
hope the other coaches agree not to play," he said. 


Although all coaches believe that the dilemma they face if a strike is called 
is severe, those most troubled may be golf and track coaches. A City 
championship marks the end of play for other sports, but track and golf finals 
also serve as qualifiers for state meets. Taft golf Coach Ray O'Connor and 
Birmingham track Coach Scott King said that they will accompany their athletes 
next week despite their loyalties to their colleagues. 


"For me to walk on my athletes would hurt me for years to come," King said. 
"There's no way I could do that. If I have one athlete left, I'll stay with 
him. I will come to school because I expect them to come to school. You can't 
just walk in in the afternoon and still coach." 


Still, some coaches expressed faith in the players' ability to understand 
should the coaches boycott events. "The issues here are greater than any one 
game," Poly baseball Coach Jerry Cord said. "I know we'll have to face some 
seniors who aren't going to be around after this year, but I truly feel the 
players will understand." 


Some coaches may get the chance to test that understanding Monday.

CITY BASEBALL COACHES TO BOYCOTT GAMES IN EVENT OF STRIKE 




By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 




A group of City Section baseball coaches said Thursday that they would honor 
picket lines and boycott the conclusion of the regular season next week if 
teachers carry out a proposed strike against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 


The group of 11 coaches also joined United Teachers-Los Angeles in criticizing 
the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn., which has recommended that coaches in all 
spring sports continue to supervise their teams even if they participate in the 
strike set for Monday. 


The position of the coaches' association was unanimously approved by 19 
representatives from the 49 City high schools at an emergency meeting Wednesday 
at Belmont High. The recommendation conforms to a directive issued this week by 
the district, which has reversed its field since the last strike 19 years ago 
when coaches who participated in the walkout were forced to the sidelines. 


The coaches' association gave its recommendation at the same time the baseball 
coaches struck their position. After a seeding meeting for the City 4-A 
Division playoffs, the coaches agreed to honor picket lines. They also said 
that they will meet Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs if a strike is not 
averted. Baseball playoffs begin May 24. The district plans no change in its 
athletics schedule and has devised no contingency plan in the event of a 
strike. 


The union endorsed the baseball coaches and urged the association to change its 
stance. 


"We're proud of the baseball coaches who took the right stand and are 
disappointed in the other coaches," union representative Helen Bernstein said. 
"I hope they change their minds. I just don't think they understood the impact 
this would have on their colleagues. We're urging the same thing for all 
activities, including band and drama. It's not fair to make exceptions for one 
group." 


Association President Paul Knox, the Dorsey High football and track coach, 
lists himself as a strong union supporter. Like most coaches, he has examined 
his loyalties this week, weighing his ties to his colleagues against those to 
his players. He said that he will strike Monday but will cross picket lines to 
coach his athletes in next week's City track semifinals. 


"We were trying to come up with something that everyone could live with," he 
said. "This is only a recommendation, not a mandate. We're trying now to get

HE MIGHT BE ON FAST TRACK, BUT IT TOOK TIME; 


FOOTBALL: FRESNO STATE'S CRAVER DIDN'T PLAY FOOTBALL AT COMPTON HIGH. NOW HE IS 
RATED AMONG THE BEST RUNNING BACKS IN COLLEGE. 




By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Fresno State tailback Aaron Craver had no idea what to do when he graduated 
from Compton High in 1985. 


Two years later, Craver still had no plans, but he had a better idea of where 
he was going: Nowhere. And fast. 


Craver served as a volunteer youth coach at a local park but didn't have a 
paying job and didn't go to college. When he wasn't coaching, he was usually in 
Compton pool halls, hustling $5 games of billiards. "I made enough to get 
through the day every day," Craver said. 


But by the spring of 1987, Craver realized he wasn't the next Minnesota Fats 
and knew he had better get on with his life. 


At the urging of fellow coaches, Craver, who ran on the track team but didn't 
play football in high school, enrolled at El Camino College and tried out for 
the football team. Little did he suspect that the decision might put him on the 
fast track to the National Football League. 


The 6-foot, 215-pound Craver rushed for 1,355 yards and 14 touchdowns in two 
seasons at El Camino and earned a scholarship to Fresno State, where he rushed 
for a school-record 1,313 yards in 1989 and was an All-Big West Conference 
selection. 


The Sporting News rated Craver as the No. 1 college running back in the nation 
going into the 1990 season, and Craver is off to a solid start, having rushed 
for 443 yards and seven touchdowns to help the Bulldogs get off to a 4-0 start. 


Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy, whose Titans play at Fresno State 
Saturday night, projects Craver as "a high-round NFL draft pick" next spring. 


"I never thought this would happen," Craver said. "Every time I go to bed at 
night I say, 'Dang, I can't believe this is happening.' It's weird, but it 
shows you what a lot of hard work can do." 


Of course, it helped that Craver also had an abundance of ability. 


Tryouts at El Camino lasted five days, but after Craver ran the 40-yard dash 
and caught a few passes on the first day, Coach John Featherstone told him he 
had made the team. 


Craver is speedy by tailback standards but has displayed the power of a 
fullback, often punishing those who tackle him. Although he's quick enough to 
run outside, he prefers to burst through holes in the line. 


He also can catch the ball, as evidenced by his 25 receptions for 168 yards and 
a touchdown in 1989 and his nine catches for 78 yards this season. 


"I tell pro scouts that, although they might not see it in our offense, he has 
the best hands of anyone I've had here since Henry Ellard," Fresno State Coach 
Jim Sweeney said. "He has amazing manual dexterity. 


"He catches footballs in practice behind his back, between his legs; he can go 
long and catch. In fact, after I hang up (the phone), I'm going to go talk to 
my offensive coordinator to find out why we don't throw to him more." 


The Fresno State coaches also see room for improvement, areas where Craver's 
inexperience shows up. For instance, a play might be designed for the tailback 
to run to a specific gap, but Craver will go for another opening. 


"He tries to ad-lib sometimes instead of being disciplined to stay with the 
play," Sweeney said. "But he also has great instincts and tremendous quickness 
for his size. Sometimes I think we over-coach him and limit his natural 
ability." 


Craver's athletic potential was a resource that went virtually untapped at 
Compton High. 


He was an accomplished Pop Warner League football player, but when he tried out 
for the team in his first year at Compton, Craver said the coaches wanted him 
to play receiver. He wanted to play running back or option quarterback. 


"They said I wasn't fast enough, that I was too small, stuff like that," Craver 
said. "But what happened was they had another running back coming in who was in 
my grade; they didn't want to run the option, and they needed receivers. 


"It wasn't that the coaches disliked me. They just didn't give me an 
opportunity to play the position I wanted to play. I had another sport I could 
do, so I said forget it and just ran track." 


Craver was a league champion in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles as a senior 
but did not receive any track scholarship offers. 


Because he skipped the sixth grade as part of a community project to advance 
brighter students through the system, Craver was only 16 when he graduated. But 
he was a C student through high school, and college was not his top priority. 


So after high school, he lived at home, which meant he didn't need a full-time 
job to survive. And he didn't have much desire to continue school. 


Then some of his friends from junior high school started getting athletic 
scholarships, and that depressed Craver. 


"I was down in the dumps then because I wished I had played high school 
football," Craver said. "Coaching took my mind off my problems. I had thought 
about going to school, but I didn't think I'd be that good of a player. Then I 
got the guts to try it." 


Craver went to El Camino hoping to have a little fun, capture some of the glory 
he missed out on in high school. 


Then all this happened. 


"I'm definitely surprised at how things turned out," Craver said. "I never 
thought I'd get a scholarship or anything like that." 


Craver has a scholarship and a lot more this season -- the expectations that 
accompany the label of "nation's best running back." Craver said it was an 
honor, but with it came a burden. 


"When they say you're the best, it makes you think you have to be better than 
you are," Craver said. "If I run for eight yards, I think, I'm supposed to be 
the best, I should have got 20 on that run. It bothers you sometimes. I may put 
too much pressure on myself." 


Sweeney said Craver shouldn't be so hard on himself because he's still learning 
the position. 


"Every time he touches the football, it's a learning experience," Sweeney said. 


It's an experience that changed his life.

HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW / SCOTT MILLER; 


ARMSTRONG IS NAMED ST. AUGUSTINE COACH 




By Scott Miller 




Jeff Armstrong has been named the new basketball coach at St. Augustine High 
School. 


Three years ago, Armstrong took over a Granite Hills team that had gone 1-21 
the previous season and proceeded to build a 43-29 record. But he wasn't a 
full-time teacher, and the St. Augustine job, vacant since Dick Hardick 
resigned after last season, offered a teaching position as well. 


"The fact that I will have an opportunity to teach, plus the fact that it 
sounds to me like the school really supports building the athletic program, are 
basically the two reasons I decided to take the challenge," Armstrong said. 
"They're building a new weight room, a new track, and they hired a new athletic 
director and football coach (Marty Martin) last year. They're basically 
rebuilding the athletic program." 


The Saints' basketball team was 2-18 last year. 


Add coaching changes: Tim Meinert is leaving as baseball coach at Christian 
High for a teaching job La Jolla Country Day, where he will likely assist Peter 
Ogle with the baseball team. 


"I'm going for the teaching job," Meinert said. "I was offered a job as the 
head of the math department and teaching three classes. It's a lighter load and 
more money. My wife just had a baby two weeks ago and quit work, so our income 
was cut in half. I knew then I'd have to look around. I know Peter wants me to 
work with him, but we haven't worked out the details yet." 


Meinert's replacement at Christian has not been named. 


In another baseball coaching change, Dave Heid has resigned at Fallbrook. His 
replacement has not been named, either. 


In basketball, Chip Holmes is replacing Jan Chapman at Hilltop, and Steve Milke 
will not return as head coach at Bonita Vista. 


And Shawn Wirth, athletic director at Torrey Pines, is giving up some of her 
day-to-day responsibilities as the school's gymnastics coach and will hire two 
more coaches. 


"The principal (Nancy Giberson) didn't want me to coach, because it took away 
from my primary job as athletic director (during the spring)," Wirth said. 


Torrey Pines gymnast Tasha Taylor finished 22nd out of 60 gymnasts Friday at 
the National High School Gymnastics Meet in Rolling Meadows, Ill. 


Her best event was the uneven parallel bars, where she was 11th with an 8.85. 


"She had to compete two days in a row, so she just didn't do very well," Wirth 
said. 


Indeed, it was an accomplishment that Taylor even arrived at the meet. She won 
the San Diego Section optional all-around title Thursday -- her second in two 
years -- and then flew all night to get to the national meet, which began at 11 
a.m. Friday. 


Left-hander Scott Karl threw a three-hitter Saturday as Carlsbad beat Crawford, 
9-0, in a San Diego Section 2-A baseball playoff game. 


But while Karl handed Crawford its first shutout this season, he didn't help 
the Carlsbad offense much: He was the lone Lancer to go hitless. And he bats 
fourth. 


"If I can pitch like this, I don't care about batting," Karl said, smiling. 


Karl has pitched Carlsbad into this afternoon's championship game against 
Grossmont after recovering from a broken ankle. He broke it playing soccer this 
winter, and three screws were inserted during surgery on Jan. 16. 


After a late start, Karl has made a pretty good recovery. He is 5-1 with a 0.00 
earned-run average in 38 innings pitched. 


Mt. Carmel second baseman Ed Cornblum hit a two-run home run in the third 
inning of Mt. Carmel's 5-4 victory over Mira Mesa in a San Diego Section 3-A 
baseball semifinal game Saturday at the University of San Diego. 


What have Cornblum's teammates called him all season? "Shortage," as in power 
shortage. 


Kendall Webb is attending a City Council meeting this morning to ask the city 
to help subsidize the section football championships in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 


A five-year agreement to use the stadium for the 2-A and 3-A championships, 
during which the city contributed as much as $8,700 each year, has expired. 
Webb is negotiating a new two-year deal. 


The fee for last year's games was $17,787. That covered the cost of rent, 
lights, sound system and scoreboard. 


Three San Diego athletes own the top marks in the state going into this 
weekend's state track meet: Orange Glen's Lenny McGill in the triple jump 
(50-4), Fallbrook's Brent Noon in the shot put (69-8 1/4, state record) and 
Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen in the 1,600 (4:53.66).
