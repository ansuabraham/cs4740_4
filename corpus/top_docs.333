<HEAD>Bush Picks ``Endeavour'' For Name Of New Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA will go after some historical ``colour''
by naming its newest space shuttle, built to replace the destroyed
Challenger, after a British sailing ship.
   The space agency announced Wednesday that President Bush had
selected the name ``Endeavour`` after it was the most popular name
in a national name-the-shuttle competition among America's school
children.
   The Endeavor was the flagship used by 18th century English
explorer James Cook.
   Thirty-one of the 111 state-level winners in the competition
chose the name Endeavour, although many of the entries used the
American spelling of Endeavor. Second most popular among the state
winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   The competition was in two divisions, kindergarten through grade
6, and grades 7 through 12. NASA selected a winning entry in each
category.
   The winning entry for kindergarten through grade 6 was from the
fifth graders of Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss.
   Winning in the other division was Tallulah Falls School,
Tallulah Falls, Ga.
   For their winning project, the Mississippi fifth graders created
a space camp where younger children were taught about space.
   The Tallulah Falls entry had two parts _ a magazine called
``Math Exploration with James Cook,'' and a play called ``Where on
Earth?'' which compared Cook's explorations with the voyages of a
space shuttle called Endeavour.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting the names selected. Panels from each
of the state education agencies then sorted through the entries and
picked state winners in the two divisions. From these state
winners, Bush made his selection.
   Endeavour was the name James Cook chose for the 98-foot vessel
he used to explore the South Pacific from 1768 to 1772. He sailed
southwest from Plymouth, England, around South America, then
explored the coasts of New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea before
returning to England by way of Africa's Cape of Good Hope,
completing a circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Cook chose the name Resolution for a ship he used in his second
and third voyages exploring the Pacific Ocean. During those trips,
Cook went as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far south as the
Antarctic Circle. He located and named the Sandwich Islands, later
called Hawaii, and was killed there in 1779.
   The second vessel in Cook's company during his final voyage was
named Discovery, the same as that given to one of the current space
shuttles.
   Challenger was destroyed Jan. 28, 1986 in an explosion that
killed seven astronauts. When Congress authorized money for a
replacement shuttle, it directed that America's school children
would name the new craft.
   The new shuttle craft is now being built by Rockwell
International in Downey, Calif. It is scheduled for completion in
1991 and will make its first space voyage in March 1992.

   Names of the ships of 18th-century British
explorer Capt. James Cook were the most popular choices among
America's school children in NASA's name-the-shuttle contest.
   The space agency said that 31 of the 111 state-level winners in a
national student competition chose the name Endeavour, though many
of the entries used the American spelling of Endeavor. Second most
popular among the state winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   Both Endeavour and Resolution are names Cook used for his ships
of exploration.
   A close third in popularity, with 11 choices, was Victoria, the
name of the ship used by Ferdinand Magellan, the 16th century
Portuguese navigator.
   State-level winners in the shuttle-naming competition were
selected by committees in each of the states, the District of
Columbia and four U.S. territories, and from the schools of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Defense Department and the State
Department. NASA announced the selections Monday.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting and justifying the names selected.
Panels from each of the state education agencies then sorted through
the entries and picked state winners in two divisions, kindergarten
through grade 6, and grades 7 through 12.
   The state-level winners will be reviewed by NASA and the final
winners in each division will be named in May, along with the chosen
name for the shuttle.
   Under the direction of Congress, NASA is letting America's school
children choose the name of the new shuttle which now is being
built. The new ship will replace Challenger, the shuttle that
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, and killed seven astronauts including
school teacher Christa McAuliffe.
   Endeavour was the name Cook chose for the 98-foot vessel he used
to explore the South Pacific from 1768 to 1772. He sailed southwest
from Plymouth, England, around South America, then explored the
coasts of New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea, before returning to
England by way of Africa's Cape of Good Hope, completing a
circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Resolution was the name Cook chose for a ship he used in his
second and third voyages exploring the Pacific Ocean. During those
trips, Cook explored as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far
south as the Antarctic Circle. He located and named the Sandwich
Islands, later called Hawaii, and was killed there in 1779.
   The second vessel in Cook's company during his final voyage was
named Discovery, the same name as that given to one of the current
space shuttles.
   Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, explored the Earth
from 1519 to 1522 on a ship he called Victoria. The vessel was the
first to sail around the world, though Magellan was killed in the
Philippines before the voyage was completed.

<TEXT>
   NASA on Wednesday asked the nation's
schoolchildren to select a name for the space shuttle that will
replace Challenger, destroyed in an explosion in 1986.
   The agency, in cooperation with the Council of Chief State
School Officers, invited teachers to enter their students in a
national competition to name the orbiter, now being built and
scheduled for its maiden flight in 1992.
   ``The orbiter-naming program responds to a basic human impulse
to name things,'' the announcement said. ``NASA's first orbiters
were named after sea vessels used in research and exploration. The
tradition of naming an orbiter after an exploratory or research sea
vessel will be continued.''
   The three remaining shuttles in the fleet are Discovery,
Atlantis and Columbia.
   NASA said the name Challenger had been retired, in honor of the
seven astronauts killed in the explosion.
   The announcement said the name chosen should not only identify
an American spacecraft but also should capture the spirit of
America's mission in space.
   Announcements of opportunity will be distributed soon to
elementary and secondary teachers and principals. Entry packets
will be available in May.
   ``To enter, elementary and secondary school students will form
teams and research a name,'' NASA said. ``Each team will prepare a
related classroom project to support and justify the name
selected.''
   There will be two entry divisions, covering kindergarten through
the sixth grade and seventh through 12th grades.
   Students in public and private schools in the United States and
U.S. territories, Department of Defense overseas dependents'
schools and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools are eligible.
   Each state, territory and agency will announce one winner in
each division in March 1989. NASA will announce the final winner
for each division and the name selected for the new shuttle in May
1989.

<LEADPARA>  The $1.8 billion space shuttle Endeavour officially rolled off the Rockwell
production line here Thursday, replacing the ill-fated Challenger and bringing
NASA's space fleet back up to its full complement of four vehicles.;    To the
majestic strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" -- which became the unofficial
anthem of the space generation when it was used as theme music in the film
"2001: A Space Odyssey" -- the 5-story tall, gleaming white craft made its
debut before a crowd of 3,000 employees and well-wishers at Air Force Plant 42.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW SHUTTLE UNVEILED; ENDEAVOUR MAKES FOUR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will not take delivery,
however, until Endeavour is flown piggyback on a 747 to the Kennedy Space
Flight Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., this weekend.;    Although the orbiter
will actually not be completed until after it reaches Florida, NASA officials
and astronauts waxed poetic about it.;    "Endeavour, the jewel of the fleet!
Isn't it beautiful?" asked astronaut Daniel Brandenstein, who will command the
shuttle on its first voyage in March 1992, a mission to bolt a new rocket
motor onto a failed communications satellite. "I tell you, if that doesn't put
a lump in your throat, I don't think you're human.";    The new shuttle
incorporates all the improvements that have been made on the other three
shuttles, and some that will not appear on those shuttles until later. The
most obvious is a drag parachute that will be deployed on landing to slow the
orbiter, thereby easing pressure on the brakes and landing gear.;    The
parachute and a newly beefed-up nose wheel will also increase control of the
shuttle when it is forced to land on the concrete runway at the Kennedy center
rather than on the longer and wider dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base
near here.;    Endeavour also contains more fuel cells, which generate
electricity, to allow it to stay in orbit for as long as 28 days, twice as
long as the existing craft.;    At the ceremony, Brandenstein was presented
with part of the sternpost recovered from the first Endeavour, a research ship
commanded by British explorer Capt. James Cook between 1768 and 1771. The
centuries-old memento will be carried into space on Endeavour's first
mission.;    Endeavour joins Discovery, which is scheduled to lift off Sunday
morning on a military mission, and Atlantis and Columbia, which were also
named after sea-going research vessels. The shuttle replaces Challenger, which
exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven aboard.  </TEXT>

   President Bush made a small ceremony do double
duty Tuesday as he honored the most recent space fliers and two
groups of school children who picked the winning name for the
newest space shuttle.
   ``We are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our
space program and really of our country itself, of America
herself,'' the president said as he shared a White House stage with
five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth-graders and nine math students
from grades 8-12.
   ``In a sense today's setting reflects the continuity,'' he said.
``You are pioneers pushing back the boundaries of our technological
future.''
   To astronauts David Walker, Ronald Grabe, Norman Thagard, Mark
Lee and Mary Cleave, who returned on May 8 from a four-day shuttle
mission, the president said, ``You've reaffirmed your nation's
genius in science and technology and yet, I think we would all
agree, this really is only just the beginning.''
   The crew on the 29th shuttle flight launched a space probe that
will orbit Venus after an 800-million-mile, 15-month journey and
map the surface of Earth's fog-shrouded sister planet.
   The pupils, from Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss.,
and Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Ga.,. each submitted
the name ``Endeavour,'' for the shuttle being built to replace the
ill-fated Challenger, which exploded after its launch in January
1986.
   ``My friends, choosing a name can be a thankless task,'' said
Bush. ``Consider the new father who was once reproached by Sam
Goldwyn. `You are going to call your son William,' he said. ``What
kind of a name is that? Every Tom, Dick and Harry is called
William.'''
   Endeavour will have the British spelling. It was the name of the
flagship used by James Cook, the 18th century English explorer and
it was chosn from several names by 31 of the 111 state-level
winners.
   Bush recalled that more than 6,100 teams formed by 71,650
students submitted research projects supporting the names they
selected. Panels from state education agencies picked state winners
in the two divisions and Bush made the final selection.

   President Bush announced Wednesday he will
nominate Navy Rear Adm. Richard Truly, an astronaut who flew in two
space shuttle missions, to head the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
NASA will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' Bush told members of Congress and others at the
White House.
   Truly, 50, became a NASA astronaut in 1969 and has been the
agency's associate administrator for space flight since 1986. He
piloted the shuttle Columbia on NASA's second space shuttle flight
and was commander of the eighth flight in 1983.
   He led the recovery team after the Challenger disaster on Jan.
28, 1986, and a subsequent team in charge of redesigning the
shuttle's boosters and revamping safety procedures.
   ``Because Dick Truly is an active duty naval officer, I will
need the assent and cooperation of the Congress to make this
appointment,'' the president said.
   B. Jay Cooper, deputy White House press secretary, said Congress
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of NASA be a
civilian.
   The position is subject to confirmation by the Senate.
   The president also announced that he plans to nominate James R.
Thompson Jr., director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., to succeed Dale D. Myers as deputy administrator
of the agency.
   Bush said that immediately after the ceremony, Truly was leaving
for Cape Canaveral to take charge of the flight readiness team for
the next space shuttle flight, in which the shuttle Atlantis will
carry the Magellan radar mapping device.
   ``The launch of Magellan is the first in a series of
long-planned space science missions scheduled for 1989, and I
personally place a great deal of importance in our nation's civil
space program,'' the president said.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get Magellan on its way
to Venus.''
   The president thanked James Fletcher, who attended the
ceremonial announcement in the Roosevelt Room, for ``an outstanding
job'' as head of NASA. Fletcher retired from the post last month
after holding it for more than two years.
   Also at the ceremony were Vice President Dan Quayle; Rep. Norm
Mineta, D-Calif.; Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.; Rep. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss.; Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; and
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., among others.
   Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man
crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle
Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet.
   Truly holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from
the Georgia Institute of Technology and was commissioned an ensign
in the U.S. Navy in 1959. He became a naval aviator in 1960 and
made more than 300 carrier landings.

   The two reusable booster rockets
that helped Atlantis soar into space were on their way back to port
today from the spot where they splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean
50 miles offshore.
   Two ships were to start towing them this morning and they were
expected to reach port by evening, said Rocky Raab, a spokesman for
Morton Thiokol Inc., which makes the rockets.
   The rockets were redesigned after the failure of a booster
rocket part caused the explosion of Challenger in January 1986 and
the deaths of seven astronauts.
   As planned, the rockets separated from the winged orbiter just a
little more than two minutes after Thursday's launch. Five minutes
after that they fell into the ocean.

<HEAD>Shuttle Launch Cheers Scientists At Planetary Science Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Venus-bound Magellan began the first
leg of a 15-month journey, scientists at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory cheered and swapped hugs and kisses, celebrating the
lab's first planetary spacecraft in 11 years.
   ``It's been a long dry spell since we've had a planetary
launch,'' said geologist Neil Nickle, spokesman for Magellan, which
was deployed from the cargo bay of Atlantis several hours after
Thursday's shuttle launch.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a California Institute of
Technology facility that runs America's unmanned space exploration
program under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Work at the lab came to a standstill as employees watched the
countdown and launch of Atlantis on closed-circuit television
monitors. Nickle said about 300 people watched from the lab's
cafeteria.
   NASA's last mission to another planet was in 1978, when a
Pioneer probe was launched to Venus. That project was run by NASA's
Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.
   All previous U.S. unmanned planetary spacecraft were launched by
expendable rockets.

<HEAD>American Planetary Probe Named For 16th-Century Portuguese Explorer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition headed by Portuguese
explorer Ferdinand Magellan needed three years to sail around the
world in the 16th century.
   That's more than twice the time it should take the robot
spacecraft Magellan to travel 806 million miles to Venus.
   Magellan, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, commanded a
five-ship flotilla that left Seville, Spain, on Sept. 20, 1519, to
search for a route to the so-called Spice Islands in the south
Pacific.
   The fleet reached South America in December and then sailed
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be
called the Straits of Magellan. The ships continued across the
Pacific Ocean and reached Guam on March 6, 1521, then went on to
what became the Philippine Islands.
   The Spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on Mactan
Island on April 27, 1521, and Magellan was killed.
   Magellan's fleet continued its voyage, with Juan Sebastian
Elcano in command, but one ship after another was lost until only
the Victoria was left. The vessel returned to Spain on Sept. 8,
1522. Only 17 men, of an original crew of 270, survived the voyage.

   Telephone callers can hear actors
who portray space explorers on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
talk about the real thing _ the first U.S. planetary mission in 11
years.
   But the four actors take a back seat to the astronauts aboard
Atlantis, who are the main stars of the 24-hour ``dial-a-shuttle''
commentary.
   Fans of both the TV show and the U.S. space program pay $2 for
the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute they stay
on the line. Callers are advised every 15 minutes when they will be
able to listen in on communications between the five astronauts and
ground control at the Johnson Space Center.
   The number is 1-900-909-NASA.
   When the astronauts and ground workers are silent, callers may
hear 60-or 90-second tapes of the Star Trek characters describing
the mission of the probe Magellan, which Atlantis is carrying into
space on its first leg of a 15-month journey to Venus.

   Some 250 spectators cheered as a space
shuttle main engine roared to life and sent smoke across the
Marshall Space Flight Center during a successful 45-second test
firing.
   ``Anything that goes the full duration looks and sounds like a
good test to me,'' center director J.R. Thompson said after
Saturday's test at the northern Alabama base.
   Thompson said the benefits of the test firings should be seen by
the mid-1990s when NASA plans to begin sending pieces of its space
station into orbit aboard the space shuttle.
   NASA engineers fired the engine as part of a series of tests to
make the main engines for the space shuttle more effective.
   John McCarty, head of the propulsion laboratory at Marshall, said
the tests will help reduce internal engine stress, making the
shuttle's main engines last longer.
   ``We're validating changes in the engine _ the first real ones
since it was designed in 1972,'' McCarty said.
   Saturday's 45-second test firing will be followed in three to
four weeks by a longer 100-second firing.

   The successful 1,000th test firing this
past week of a main space shuttle engine at NASA's National Space
Technology Laboratories shows the engine's reliability, officials
say.
   ``This 1,000th test is a milestone,'' NSTL Director Jerry Hlass
said.
   The test was conducted Thursday night for a duration of 9
minutes, 33 seconds.
   ``Engine 0211 is being checked out ... and early indications
show the test firing was a succcess,'' Boyce Mix, the engine test
manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said
Friday.
   Space shuttle main engine testing has been conducted at NSTL
since June 1975.
   ``Last year at NSTL, there was a record number of engine tests
in terms of test duration _ 33,738 seconds, the equivalent time the
engines would be required to perform for 22 shuttle launches,''
Hlass said. ``Our team is working very diligently to do its part in
returning the shuttle to safe flight.''
   Thursday night's test was the 11th conducted this year, said
Mack Herring, NSTL public affairs officer.
   Each shuttle orbiter is powered by three main engines, which
operate for the first 8.5 minutes of flight to propel the shuttle
to the point of near-earth orbit.
   All main engines used for shuttle missions are test-fired three
times before they are transported by truck to the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
   The testing is conducted by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell
International, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
prime contractor for the shuttle engines.

   A fault found at the last minute in one of the
launch systems of the Soviet space shuttle forced scientists today
to indefinitely postpone the maiden voyage of the unmanned craft.
   The official Tass news agency said a computer halted the
countdown 51 seconds before launch to prevent the booster, known as
Energiya, from hitting the launch platform during liftoff.
   ``The assembly platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
Tass said. The platform is believed to be an arm-like structure that
stretches to the booster.
   A computer that senses 140 elements of the launch system
terminated the launch process, Tass said. The report quoted the test
control chief at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia, air
force Maj. Gen. V. Gudilin.
   Gudilin told Tass he didn't think it would be long before the
launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough analysis of
today's problem would have to be completed before a new blastoff
date was decided.
   Fuel was drained from the rocket, Tass said, and it appeared a
second launch attempt would not be made today.
   The shuttle, named Buran, or snowstorm in Russian, was originally
set to lift off late Friday from the Baikonur launch site on the
Central Asian steppe in Kazakhstan. But Tass and Radio Moscow
announced earlier today a four-hour delay, one half-hour after the
scheduled launch time expired.
   Then, seconds before liftoff a second time, Tass in a terse
statement announced there was an ``indefinite'' delay.
   There was no live report from Baikonur by either radio or
television. Foreign reporters were not allowed to travel to Baikonur.
   Buran was to make two orbits and return to a concrete landing
strip eight miles from the launch site. Reports indicated the
initial flight would be devoted entirely to checking out the craft
and would not be used to deploy satellites or conduct any other
missions.
   Ships stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, a satellite
network and a string of ground stations were poised to communicate
with the craft and monitor its flight, Soviet television said in a
brief report.
   Buran is attached to the Energiya rocket, the world's most
powerful launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters. It looks like the
U.S. space shuttle.
   But Soviet officials say it can carry a payload of 66,000 pounds,
compared to the U.S. shuttle's 55,000 pounds, is safer and more
flexible.
   The fully automated guidance system permits scientists to send
the craft into space for the first time without cosmonauts,
decreasing the risk to human life, Soviet officials said.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the U.S. shuttle
program that was stalled until this fall after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in January 1986.
   In a report late Friday, the television news program Vremya
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
   ``As always in our country, military specialists participate in
crucial, dangerous tests,'' a correspondent said in a report from
Baikonur.
   It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations
as Alexander A. Maksimov. It identified him as the Defense
Ministry's top specialist on ``multiple-use space transport systems
and the prospect of their development.''
   Soviet officials repeatedly have criticized military use of the
U.S. space shuttle, and have called for space to be used only for
peaceful purposes.
   The U.S. Defense Department, in its 1988 publication Soviet
Military Power, says the Soviets might use a shuttle to deploy
anti-satellite and ballistic missile defense weapons.
   Reports Friday said the Buran can carry as many as 10 people _
four cosmonauts and six passengers _ and placed its cost of Energiya
and Buran at about that of the U.S. shuttle, some $10 billion.
   Energiya, which can lift a payload of more than 100 tons, has
been used only once before. On a test flight in May 1987, its
payload failed to reach orbit, but Soviet officials said the problem
was with the guidance system of the satellite rather than with the
gigantic booster.

A Cree Indian has completed a 2,700-mile run from Edmonton, Canada, to New York 
City to lay claim to a sacred relic stored in the American Museum of Natural 
History. Carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength and 
wearing a wolf pelt for protection, Jim Thunder said he was driven by a 
recurring dream in which Chief Big Bear of the Crees instructed him to retrieve 
the artifact -- a parcel of calico holding bear claws, a clump of sweet grass 
and a plug of tobacco. Big Bear, leader of the Plains Cree, made the sacred 
bundle about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into 
battle for strength and guidance. In 1934, Big Bear's son gave it to a museum 
researcher in western Canada for safekeeping. Since that time, the museum has 
kept it as part of a research collection but has never put it on display. 
Thunder and a small delegation of Indians were to meet with museum officials 
who will decide whether to give up the parcel. Thunder told about 100 Indians 
and supporters: "We are confident that we will get the bundle back because 
since the 1930s there have been prophesies that it would return."

 -- After 40 years, 11,000 performances and 500 stitches, legendary tiger tamer 
Gunther Gebel-Williams has decided it's time to call it quits before his skills 
start to fade. The 54-year-old performer, who is beginning his two-year 
farewell tour with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, said: "I'm 
still very strong, but when you get older your eyesight begins to go and I have 
to wear glasses offstage. But I can't wear them in the ring." Williams became 
famous for his ability to control animals without the usual whip, chair or 
pistol. In his current show, he puts Bengal and Siberian tigers through their 
paces, stands on the back of a charging elephant and puts Lippizaner horses 
through a ballet routine. "I am very close to my cats," he said, "but I can't 
ever let down my guard because while I can succeed in training them, I can 
never tame them."

 -- The name Endeavor, one of 18th-Century British explorer Capt. James Cook's 
ships, tops the list of suggested names for the next space shuttle in a 
competition among the nation's schoolchildren. The second most popular choice 
is Resolution, the name of another of Cook's vessels, followed by Victoria, the 
name of the ship used by Ferdinand Magellan, the 16th-Century Portuguese 
navigator. More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted research 
projects supporting and justifying the names selected. NASA is letting 
schoolchildren choose the name of the shuttle to replace Challenger, which 
exploded in January, 1986. The final choice will be announced in May. DEBORAH

   Magellan, America's first
interplanetary probe in 11 years, is named for a Portuguese
explorer who 467 years ago led the expedition that was the first to
sail around the world.
   After it is deployed in orbit by the space shuttle, the Magellan
probe will travel to Venus in 15 months. The 800-million-mile
voyage will last less than half as long as it took a 16th-century
expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan to sail around the world.
   Magellan, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, was
commander of a five-ship flotilla that left Seville, Spain on Sept.
20, 1519 to search for a route to the so-called Spice Islands in
the south Pacific.
   The fleet reached South America in December and then sailed
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be
called the Straits of Magellan.
   After following the west coast of South America, Magellan
directed his fleet across the Pacific Ocean. The ships made
landfall at Guam on March 6, 1521, and then went on to what became
the Philippine Islands.
   The Spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on Mactan
Island on April 27, 1521, and Magellan was killed. The anniversary
of his death fell on Thursday.
   Magellan's fleet continued its voyage, with Juan Sebastian
Elcano in command, but one ship after another was lost until only
the Victoria was left. The vessel returned to Spain on Sept. 8,
1522. Only 17 men, of an original crew of 270, survived the
three-year voyage.
   Though Magellan died before the trip ended, he is generally
credited with the first circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Stargazing sailors on the voyage are credited with discovery of
two star galaxies, called the Magellanic Clouds, which are visible
only from the southern hemisphere.

   Space shuttle Atlantis
landed on a gusty desert runway Monday after putting U.S. planetary
exploration back on track with the launch of the unmanned Magellan
probe to Venus.
   Atlantis touched down at 12:43 p.m. PDT on a concrete runway at
Rogers Dry Lake after a fiery, hour-long plunge from orbit 184
miles above Earth.
   ``Congratulations and nice landing,'' said capsule communicator
Frank Culbertson in Houston. ``You've extended the shuttle's reach
far beyond Earth orbit now. Commodore Magellan (the 16th century
explorer for which the Venus probe was named) would approve.''
   ``It's good to be back. It's a great trip,'' shuttle commander
David M. Walker told reporters and space agency workers before the
crew flew back to Johnson Space Center four hours after landing.
   ``We had a great time on orbit. ... We hope you liked what we
did,'' said mission specialist Mary L. Cleave.
   The crew left the orbiter about an hour after landing and
inspected its underside, accompanied by senior National Aeronautics
and Space Administration officials. They found little damage to its
thermal tiles.
   ``The vehicle looks about as clean as any one that I've ever
seen,'' Richard Truly, NASA's acting associate administrator for
space flight, told a post-landing news conference.
   ``The Magellan spacecraft ... is floating toward the planet
Venus to open up a new era of planetary exploration,'' Truly said.
   Only about 27,500 of a predicted 100,000 spectators braved
baking heat to see Atlantis dive through the thin, high clouds and
rock the desert with the its signature twin sonic booms.
   About 200 people cheered the astronauts' return home Monday
night at Houston's Ellington Field. Even a few of the astronauts'
dogs were on hand to greet their 9:45 p.m. CDT arrival.
   ``I can't tell you how grateful all of us are to those of you
who have supported us personally and professionally through all
these many months of training and through, in fact, our whole
careers,'' Walker told the crowd of mostly Johnson Space Center
workers.
   The astronauts left the airport with their families. They were
scheduled to report back to work Tuesday to begin reviewing their
mission.
   Just 12 minutes before touchdown, Atlantis was ordered to land
on the concrete Runway 22 rather than the hard-packed clay of
Runway 17 as dust devils whipped up by the variable winds twirled
across the lakebed.
   Truly said the switch was apparently ordered because the
crosswind angle was better on the concrete runway for a test of
handling under such conditions _ a precursor to someday resuming
landings at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The crosswinds at landing were believed to have ranged from 12.6
mph to 20.7 mph, which would have yielded ``significant''
information on such landings, Arnold D. Aldrich, director of the
shuttle program.
   Re-entry began when two big engines at the rear of the
spacecraft ignited and burned for 2 minutes, 38 seconds over the
Indian Ocean on Atlantis' 64th orbit.
   The crew _ commander Walker, pilot Ronald J. Grabe, and mission
specialists Norman E. Thagard, Mark Lee and mission specialist
Cleave _ rocketed into space from Kennedy Space Center on Thursday
and launched the Magellan spacecraft.
   The $550 million probe will reach Venus after a 15-month, 800
million-mile journey and begin mapping the surface of Earth's
cloud-shrouded sister.
   ``The trajectory is about as accurate as you can get,'' said
Lennard Fisk, associate administrator for space science and
applications. ``I think we demonstrated with this flight that the
shuttle is in fact very capable of putting a planetary mission up.''
   Magellan marks the first new U.S. planetary exploration in 11
years. The start of its mission was cheered by scientists working
on a variety of programs that were delayed by the long hiatus in
the shuttle program after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.
   NASA last explored Venus with the 1978 launch of the Pioneer
probe, which examined the planet's murky atmosphere and did some
radar mapping. Magellan's radar should map of 90 percent of the
planet and with much greater resolution than Pioneer.
   The Soviet Union sent two Venera probes to Venus in 1983 but
only mapped about a quarter of its surface.
   Atlantis' mission, the fourth since shuttle flights resumed
Sept. 29, 1988, had two significant technical problems. The orbiter
was 31 seconds from launch on April 28 when a short-circuit was
detected in a fuel pump, delaying takeoff until the pump and a
leaky fuel line were replaced. On Sunday, one of the four redundant
computers that control the shuttle's systems failed.
   The crew was able to restart the computer but mission
controllers decided not to trust it for re-entry. The crew
abandoned other tasks and spent 4{ hours replacing the faulty
computer with a spare, the first time that had been done.
   The shuttle could land with just one computer operating,
according to NASA.
   Until the computer problem developed, the crew had worked on an
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a furnace and
had photographed lightning and pollution on Earth.
   The workload for mission STS-30 was light because Magellan and
its booster weighed 45,000 pounds, cutting the number of
experiments that could be carried.
   The mission also served to boost flight experience in the
shuttle astronaut corps. It was the third shuttle flight for
Thagard, the second for Walker, Grabe and Cleave, and the first for
Lee.

   Seconds before the scheduled blastoff, the maiden
voyage of the Soviet space shuttle was delayed Saturday because of
trouble with ground equipment. It was the fifth setback this year
for the Soviet space program.
   Soviet officials did not immediately announce when a second
attempt would be made to launch the Buran on its unmanned test
flight.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said scientists at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia traced Saturday's snag to
an equipment platform that failed to pull away from the booster
rocket.
   With 51 seconds to go, a computer stopped the countdown because
the booster, known as Energiya, would have hit the platform at
takeoff.
   The sudden halt was similar to the dramatic last-minute
postponement of the liftoff of the world's first shuttle. The U.S.
craft Columbia was delayed for two days in April 1981 because of
computer software problems. Some subsequent U.S. shuttle flights
also were delayed.
   ``The accessory platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
Tass said 11 hours after the scheduled 6:23 a.m. liftoff.
   Tass said a computer that senses 140 elements of the launch
system halted the countdown and that thousands of tons of liquid
fuel were being drained from Energiya. The report quoted Baikonur's
test control chief, Air Force Maj. Gen. Vladimir E. Gudilin.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the platform contained
equipment to aim the spacecraft toward the proper trajectory. The
newspaper quoted Gudilin as saying the platform withdrew somewhat,
but not completely.
   Gudilin was quoted as saying he didn't think it would be long
before the launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough
analysis of the problem would have to be completed.
   Soviet television, in its evening news program Vremya, said the
words ``automatic termination of preparations'' flashed on a
computer screen at Baikonur as dozens of scientists watched.
   The broadcast showed the gleaming white shuttle orbiter and
rocket booster on the launch pad after the liftoff attempt, with
what it said was liquid oxygen venting from Energiya.
   The shuttle, which looks like the U.S. space shuttle, was
scheduled to orbit the Earth twice and land on a runway eight miles
from the blastoff site. The flight was to be controlled entirely by
computers and was meant to test launch and landing equipment and
procedures, Soviet news reports said. There was no indication the
shuttle was to have deployed any satellites.
   Buran can carry as many as 10 people _ four cosmonauts and six
passengers. It is attached to Energiya, the world's most powerful
launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters.
   Saturday's postponement was the latest in a series of problems
that have dogged Soviet space flights since the spring:
   _Ground controllers lost contact in April with a Soviet
nuclear-powered satellite, Cosmos-1900, and Western Europeans
expressed concern it would release radioactivity when it re-entered
the atmosphere. The satellite burned up safely upon re-entry Oct. 2.
   _Soviet cosmonaut Anatoly Levchenko, a 47-year-old test pilot for
the shuttle program, died Aug. 6 of a brain tumor. Levchenko had
been among the candidates to fly the shuttle on its first manned
mission. His death leaves Igor Volk the only cosmonaut known to be
in line for a shuttle flight.
   _A ground controller sent an incorrect signal to the unmanned
Soviet space probe Phobos 1 on Aug. 29, freezing the craft and
ending its radio contact with Earth. The probe was on its way to
Mars on a multimillion-dollar mission to unlock the mysteries of the
planet.
   _On Sept. 6, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were stranded in
orbit aboard a Soyuz TM-5 capsule with diminishing air and food
after two unsuccessful attempts to land. The cosmonauts eventually
overcame human error and equipment problems to land safely.
   In Saturday's attempted launch, Tass initially announced a
four-hour delay but then said blastoff had been delayed
indefinitely. Soviet television did not cover launch preparations
live, and foreign reporters were not allowed to visit Baikonur.
   Soviet officials say the Buran orbiter can carry a payload of
66,000 pounds, compared to the U.S. shuttle's 55,000 pounds, and
that it is more flexible and safer.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the U.S. shuttle
program, suspended until this fall after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in January 1986.
   In a report late Friday, the evening television news program
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations as
Alexander A. Maksimov but did not say how the Defense Ministry would
use the craft.

   Space workers will hold a special
Fourth of July ceremony when they move Discovery to the launch pad
to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since the
Challenger tragedy.
   One of the five astronauts slated to fly the early September
mission and NASA officials will watch from a flag-bedecked
grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an assembly building
into the glare of spotlights at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   Discovery will be perched upright on a giant tracked transporter
for the six-to-seven-hour trip over a 4.2-mile course to Launch Pad
39B.
   The move is timed to avoid thunderstorms and lightning, which
often occur during the daytime this time of year.
   In a brief ceremony as the move begins, Forrest S. McCartney,
director of the Kennedy Space Center, will present the astronaut
with a book containing signatures of the 15,240 workers here who
have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space.
   Commander Rick Hauck and his crew, Dick Covey, George Nelson,
Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers, will take the book into space with
them on a four-day mission. Hilmers planned to be here for the
rollout ceremony.
   After Discovery is on the pad, employees and their families will
be able to drive by between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Monday to get a
close look before a service structure encloses the spaceship.
   Jim Harrington, shuttle operations director here, said delays in
preparing Discovery placed the rollout date on the Fourth of July.
   ``We didn't plan it that way,'' he said. ``We had hoped to do it
earlier.''
   Asked if a rollout on the nation's birthday might have an
emotional impact, Harrington replied, ``No doubt it will have an
effect. The biggest effect and the biggest morale booster we can
give ourselves is to move the shuttle out to the pad, because
that's where it belongs. The name of the game here is to get the
vehicle ready to fly, and that's what we're going to do.''
   He said checks of systems will begin as soon as Discovery is on
the pad, and workers will begin preparing the spaceship for
critical firing of its three main engines on July 24. With the
craft bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the engines will be
ignited for 19.4 seconds to test modifications and to give the
launch team countdown practice.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Challenger and its
crew of seven were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff
Jan. 28, 1986.
   Earlier this week, the space agency announced it had officially
delayed Discovery's launch from late August until early September
because it was taking longer than expected to prepare the vehicle.

   A European Space Agency astronaut will be among the
international crew aboard the space shuttle Columbia on its
December mission, ESA announced Friday.
   Dr. Ulf Merold will serve as one of two payload specialists on
the 9-day flight that will also carry Dr. Roberta L. Bondar of the
Canadian Space Agency, mission specialists Mary L. Cleave, Norman
E. Thagard and William F. Feaddy, Air Force Col. Ronald J. Grab,
the commander of the flight, and pilot Stephan S. Oswald.
   The microgravity mission will be the first of a series using a
European-developed spacelab module. A team of more than 200
scientists in 12 countries will conduct experiments in materials
and life sciences, including gravitational plant physiology and
space physiology.
   The materials experiments in the microgravity environment will
focus on vapor crystal growth systems and protein crystal growth
among others.
   This will be Merbold's second space mission. In December 1987,
he was chosen from among 2,000 European applicants to fly aboard
the first spacelab on the 10-day mission launched Nov. 28, 1983.
   Born 1941 in Greiz, West Germany, Merbold worked as a
solid-state physicist at the Max Planck Institute for metals
research before joining ESA.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's new space shuttle, a
reusable craft that lands on a runway, will make its maiden voyage
at about the same time that the U.S. space shuttle is scheduled to
return to orbit for the first time since the Challenger disaster,
an industry magazine reports.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology released a report Friday
saying the Soviet shuttle will be launched in August and ``roughly
coincide'' with the return to flight of the American space shuttle.
   Launch of the U.S. space shuttle is now expected in late August,
probably on Aug. 29, according to NASA sources.
   The Soviet space shuttle, which closely resembles the American
original in exterior design, is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit
in what is expected to be a short test mission.
   Earlier reports said that the Soviet shuttle's initial test
flight would be conducted unmanned, but officials disclosed last
week that the plans call for two pilots.
   Aviation Week quoted Soviet Lt. Gen. Vladium Shatalov, chief of
the Soviet space program, as saying, ``When the Americans tested
their shuttle, two men took off. I believe that this experience is
reasonable and can be used in our country.''
   The Soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquid-fueled rocket
called the Energia. Unlike the American craft, the launch rockets
are not a part of the orbiting craft. Instead, the Soviet shuttle
includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to
the atmosphere. This will give the Soviet shuttle a greater range
to manuever than the U.S. shuttle, which returns from space as a
glider with no engines.
   Challenger exploded shortly after launch from the Kennedy Space
Center on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven crew members were killed. Since
then, the shuttle fleet has been grounded while National
Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers redesigned and
tested flawed equipment, including the solid-fueled rocket engines
that were blamed for the accident.
   In August, space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched
from the Kennedy Space Center with a crew of five, all veteran
astronauts, and land four days later at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif.
   Aviation Week said the Soviet shuttle flight is part of an
``unprecedented'' series of space missions over the next three
months.
   ``Never before has the USSR attempted so many major new space
missions withing the same period,'' the magazine said.
   Among the Soviet flights are:
   _Two robot craft to be launched to Mars and to the Martian moon
Phobos. The craft will lift off on July 7 and July 12 for the most
complex planetary missions yet attempted by the Soviets. The craft
will include instruments provided by eight countries and the
European Space Agency. The United States is not participating.
   _On June 7, a Soyuz spacecraft with a Soviet and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut will be launched to the space station Mir for an
eight-day mission. In August, a second Soyuz will be launched with
a Soviet and an Afghan on board.
   _Last Sunday, the Soviets launched a military intelligence craft
the size of a school bus in a 530-mile circular orbit.
   Two cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir completed their
150th day in orbit last Monday. The Soviet Union has now exceeded
128,000 man-hours in space, more than triple the U.S. total of
42,463 hours.

   Engineers examined a space shuttle
main engine Tuesday to determine if damage it suffered in a
test-firing could delay this summer's launch of the shuttle Columbia.
   ``Engineers have to inspect the engine and look at the data
before they can make a decision about Columbia's launch,'' said Dave
Drachlis, a space agency spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   The failure happened Friday on a test stand at the Stennis Space
Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., during firing of a development
engine that has been ignited 23 times over several years to test new
parts for future shuttle flights.
   Columbia's three main engines already are in place as technicians
here prepare it for a launch in late July or early August on a
classified Defense Department mission.
   Jerry Smelser, head of the engine program at the Marshall center,
said NASA needs to determine if the problem involves parts similar
to those in Columbia's engines.
   Drachlis said the test engine operated normally until about 21
minutes into a planned firing of 22 minutes 17 seconds, when there
was a sudden shutdown and a fire. During a shuttle launch, the main
engines normally fire for about 8 minutes 30 seconds.
   There was significant damage to several internal parts, Drachlis
said.
   ``The engine did not blow up; it's still fundamentally intact,''
he said.
   The engine was flown to its manufacturer, the Rocketdyne Division
of Rockwell International in Canoga Park, Calif. Drachlis said
engineers would take the engine apart for detailed inspection.

   A practice space shuttle countdown
was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of
Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad Saturday.
   The launch team started the count at 11:33 p.m. Sunday. On
Wednesday, it planned to load more than a half million gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttle's
external fuel tank.
   It will be the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28,
1986.
   When the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock lift-off on
Wednesday, a problem will be simulated to force a launch
postponement. Then launch crews will rehearse what's called a
72-hour turnaround.
   They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown, refill
the tank and aim for a 20-second test firing of Discovery's main
engines at 7:30 a.m. Saturday.
   The firing, with the shuttle bolted firmly on the pad, will
check modifications made to the engines and is considered critical
to Discovery being certified for the first post-Challenger shuttle
flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
September, but the date is in doubt as engineers continue to puzzle
over how to fix a small gas leak in a steering engine system that
is separate from the main engines.
   They hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling
Discovery back to a hangar, a move that could delay the flight as
much as two months.
   Experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible
leak, including cutting a hole through the shuttle's cargo bay wall
and running a snake-like tube through the gas line in an effort to
plug it.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it will
not make a decision on whether to move Discovery off the pad until
after the main engine test firing.

   A space shuttle main rocket engine will
be test-fired Wednesday at the Marshall Space Flight Center, the
first extended firing since the roar of Saturn rockets echoed
across Huntsville in the 1960s.
   ``It's going to be something Huntsville hasn't heard for quite
awhile,'' Marshall spokesman Dom Amatore said.
   The 15-second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle
main engines and coincides with the city's ``Space Awareness Week.''
   NASA engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors,
fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttle's huge external
tank, can run if needed. The engines now operate for about eight
minutes during a shuttle launch.
   Shuttle engine No. 0208, installed in the test stand in August,
was ``warmed up'' in a 1.5-second start test last month.
   After this week's test, a third test firing of 45 seconds will
be scheduled in November. Amatore said the primary goal of the
first brief tests is to verify that Marshall can handle the firings
and whether a metal ``flame bucket'' on the test stand can handle
the rocket exhaust.
   The last test firing of a big rocket motor at Marshall was a
Saturn test on Sept. 11, 1969, about two months after men first set
foot on the moon.
   Marshall is NASA's main propulsion center. In addition to
developing the Saturn rockets, it manages space shuttle propulsion
systems, including the main engines and solid fuel booster rockets,
which are test-fired in Utah.
   ``Space Awareness Week'' includes a visit by the crew of the
shuttle Discovery.
   The five astronaunts who flew last month in the first
post-Challenger shuttle mission are to be in Huntsville on Thursday
and Friday to thank Marshall engineers.
   They also will lead a parade and appear at a public reception
Thursday.
   On Wednesday, singer John Denver and former New Mexico senator
and Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmitt will be in town to discuss
proposed new space missions.
   Denver, who hopes to ride into orbit with a Soviet crew in 1990,
will talk about Earth observation missions while Schmitt will
discuss proposals for manned missions to the moon and Mars.

   To bystanders, it looked as if the
contestants were trying to fish from the third-floor balcony of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday.
   In fact, the students and teachers were competing in an
experiment that could alter how spacecraft dock in outer space.
   The competition's long-range goal was to devise a cheaper, more
effective method of linking the space shuttle with the space
station. Present space shuttle docking plans are expensive and
time-consuming, said MIT Professor Andreas H. von Flotow.
   The simulated design contest was sponsored by von Flotow and
Energy Sciences Laboratory Inc. of San Diego. The $500 first prize
and a possible job with the company was offered to the competitor
who completed the docking maneuver in the shortest time.
   The experiment involved dropping a tether line from a third-floor
balcony in the MIT lobby, or the ``space station,'' and trying to
connect it with the ``space shuttle'' on the floor below, fashioned
from a garbage can and contestant-made nose cones.
   The trick was linking the tether to the space shuttle as rapidly
as possible without risking hard impact. But the link had to be
strong enough to lift the simulated space station off the floor.
   ``This idea has been drifting around for years,'' said von
Flotow, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at
MIT. ``But the aerospace business is the most conservative around.
They don't always want to try new things, even if there are
considerable benefits.''
   Von Flotow said several aerospace companies had expressed
interest in seeing the winning design.
   Currently, the plans for a shuttle-space station docking call for
what is termed metal-to-metal mating, which requires hours of
precision flying to dock a relatively small payload.
   Since the cost of docking is estimated to be about $100,000 per
second, substantial savings can result from finding a faster
procedure, von Flotow said.
   Von Flotow said docking would require less fuel if a soft device
on a miles-long tether were dropped from the orbiting space station
to dock remotely with the space shuttle's payload at a sub-orbital
altitude.
   He said several of the designs attempted Wednesday could work in
space, where tether lines would be required to lift 6,600 pounds of
weight.
   Four teams of contestants competed in the two-hour experiment.
The winner, MIT graduate student Siegfried Zerweckh, used a fishnet
attached to the tether line to grasp a nose cone made of foam
rubber. His best time was 9.9 seconds.
   MIT Professor Norman Ham, the only faculty member to compete,
lowered two balloons and hooked them to cylindrical wires attached
to the nose cone in a 19-second docking maneuver.
   To ensure that the simulated docking mechanisms would not damage
a space shuttle, von Flotow tested each of the entries by dropping
them on an egg and making sure they did not break it.
   ``It's something you can create and develop and at the same time
it may prove really useful some day,'' said Gary Carr, a U.S.
Department of Transportation mechanical engineer who was on the only
non-MIT participant in the contest.

   Voyager 2's Neptune encounter marks the
last planetary flyby by a U.S. spacecraft, but missions to Venus,
Jupiter and Mars mean America will keep exploring space, a NASA
official said Saturday.
   ``We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,''
said Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to launch
35 space science flights in the next five years _ the highest launch
rate ever _ and U.S. spacecraft will be exploring planets
continuously from next year until 2006, Fisk said during a visit to
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Fisk was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with Neptune last
Thursday night _ the probe's final encounter after it explored
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   ``In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will
see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase
of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore
Pluto, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft
   But Fisk listed several missions that will orbit planets rather
than fly past them:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, arrives at
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo will be launched from the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 12,
arriving in orbit around Jupiter in 1996 and studying the planet
until the end of the century.
   _The Hubble Space Telescope is due for launch from a shuttle next
March, and is so powerful that from its orbit around Earth it will
be able to ``observe the universe back to the beginning of time,''
Fisk said.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992, reaching the red planet
in 1993 and studying it until 1996.
   _NASA has asked Congress to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid
Flyby and Cassini missions, Fisk said. CRAF would fly past an
asteroid, then orbit a comet from 2000 through 2002, Fisk said. The
similar spacecraft on the Cassini mission would drop a probe onto
Saturn's moon Titan, then orbit Saturn from 2002 through 2006.
   Fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will
suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that 70
percent to 80 percent of non-military shuttle flights will be
dedicated to space science.
   Fisk said space science studies suffered in recent years not from
a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted
launches until last fall.

   Space shuttle Discovery made its
long-delayed trip to the launch pad today, cheered on by
flag-waving workers who have waited 2{ years for a rebirth of the
American space program.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told a Fourth of July crowd of several hundred engineers,
technicians and others who watched as the 85-ton spaceship edged
out of an assembly building into the glare of floodlights at 12:50
a.m.
   ``What more fitting present can we make to our country than this
on the day of its birthday,'' said Hilmers, one of five crew
members scheduled to fly Discovery on the first post-Challenger
mission, set for early September.
   Discovery, attached to its external fuel tank and two solid-fuel
booster rockets, was perched on the broad back of a giant tracked
transporter that lumbered along at less than 1 mph in covering the
4.2-mile route to the pad in 6{ hours.
   The shuttle arrived at Pad 39B at 7:30 a.m., and technicians
began connecting its various systems to the launch tower, including
air-conditioning and electricity, and extending platforms from the
pad so workers can have access to the shuttle.
   NASA scheduled the move in the early morning to avoid
thunderstorms and lightning that are common during the daytime in
the summer months.
   For three hours, starting at 8 a.m., space center workers and
their families were permitted to drive personal cars past the
launch pad for a good look at Discovery before a service structure
enclosed it.
   A recording of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' was played as the
shuttle began the move to Launch Pad 39B, the same pad from which
Challenger was launched on the flight that killed seven astronauts
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years since Challenger, and I'm very
pleased with the progress we've made during that time,'' Forrest S.
McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, said at the
rollout ceremony. ``It's been a team effort. ... This is a proud
day.''
   McCartney presented Hilmers with a book containing the names of
more than 15,000 Kennedy Space Center workers who have labored to
return the shuttle fleet to space.
   Hilmers said the astronauts would carry the book, bearing the
inscription ``The KSC team is with you,'' into orbit aboard
Discovery, ``knowing that our journey will be safer because of
you.''
   ``It kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of
struggling and looking at ourselves inwardly and outwardly, and
here it is; it's finally a reality,'' Hilmers said.
   ``This is what I call a happy Fourth of July,'' said astronaut
Bob Crippen, a veteran of four shuttle flights who is now deputy
director of shuttle operations.
   Workers were to spend several hours securing Discovery on the
pad and then begin preparing it for a critical test-firing of its
three main liquid fuel engines. The test, with the spaceship bolted
firmly on its launch mounts, is set for July 24.
   The following day, a final pre-flight test-firing of the
redesigned solid-fuel booster rocket is planned at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery
is certified for flight.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after liftoff. Since then, the booster has
been significantly redesigned and tested, and hundreds of other
modifications have been made to the shuttle main engines and other
systems.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle crew members will be at
the controls when Discovery blasts off on a four-day mission. The
others are commander Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George
Nelson.
   They will deploy a communications satellite, conduct scientific
and technical experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter
systems.

   With Thursday's announcement, six crews have been selected for
shuttle missions, which are to resume Aug. 4. The shuttle fleet has
been grounded since the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts in January 1986.
   Shuttle mission STS-29, scheduled for launch Jan. 19, 1989, will
be commanded by Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats. The others are Air

   STS stands for space transportation system.
   Navy Capt. David M. Walker will command STS-30, set for launch
April 27, 1989. With him will be Air Force Col. Ronald J. Grabe,
Air Force Maj. Mark C. Lee, Norman E. Thagard and Mary L. Cleave.
Their mission will start planetary probe Magellan on its way to map
the entire surface of Venus with radar.
   The STS-31 mission will feature deployment of the Hubble Space
Telescope and is set for June 1, 1989. Air Force Col. Loren J.
Shriver will command the flight. The others are Marine Col. Charles

   Soviet space scientists declared a brilliant
success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle Buran, and
are planning a much longer second mission, Tass said Tuesday.
   ``The previous program was brilliantly performed; when the craft
came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program
reached only one second, while the deviation of the Buran's axis
from that of the runway was only 1.5 meters,'' the official news
agency reported.
   Only five of the 39,000 heat-protecting tiles broke away during
the 3-hour, 20-minute flight Nov. 15 and the spacecraft, whose name
means Snowstorm in Russian, successfully maneuvered in bad weather,
Tass said.
   It quoted Gen. German Titov as saying: ``We deliberately refused
to postpone the launch and wait for ideal conditions. The value of
the flight is that its program included the maximum sum of real and
rather difficult tasks.''
   Tass said the landing took place in relatively high winds and
thick clouds.
   Officials have said the shuttle's second flight also will be
unmanned. No precise information on its length was available.
   Cosmonauts on another Soviet space mission, a joint project
including French cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chretien, began working aboard
the orbiting space station Mir on Tuesday, a day after docking their
Soyuz TM-7 capsule.
   Chretien will return with Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who
have set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year
when they make the descent Dec. 21. Commander Alexander Volkov and
Sergei Krikalev, who went into space with the Frenchman, will remain
on the Mir until April.
   Tass said one project, designed by French scientists, is to make
a detailed study of the cardio-vascular system in space flight,
using ultra sound to evaluate blood flow.

   NASA said today it will not try to
launch space shuttle Atlantis and the robot probe targeted for
Venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected
on the space shuttle and ``we don't know when we can go.''
   Sources close to the program reported earlier that the
postponement could be at least 10 days, but later said that was
based on a preliminary assessment. They said the delay will be
several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if
technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line.
   NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said NASA officials are evaluating
the problems today and have assigned committees to study each
element. She reports from those committees will be made on Sunday.
   ``We don't know when we can go,'' said Malone. ``It depends on
where the troubleshooting takes us.''
   A launch countdown was stopped Friday with just 31 seconds left
after controllers detected an electrical power surge in a main
engine fuel pump. Later, engineers found leak in a hydrogen fuel
line.
   Atlantis is to carry into space a robot probe called Magellan
which is to fly to the planet Venus in a resumption of America's
exploration of the solar system after an 11-year gap.
   Earlier, Robert Sieck, the Kennedy Space Center launch director,
said technicians would remove panels of the engine compartment to
get at the pump.
   The leaky hydrogen line, which spewed a cloud of vapor toward
the end of the countdown, also must be repaired, Sieck said.
Engineers believe the vapor escaped through a pinhole in a fitting.
   The technicians worked through the night to drain a half million
gallons of oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel from Atlantis. They then
planned to install scaffolding at the base of the spacecraft and
remove panels covering the engine compartment.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said engineers should be able to
examine the faulty pump by tonight. Only then can it be determined
how the problem will be corrected. The experts looked at the leaky
hydrogen line this morning, but were still undecided on what
repairs were needed for that problem, he said.
   If either the pump or the hydrogen line have to be replaced, the
launch could be postponed until ``well into next week,'' Sieck said.
   Atlantis couldn't be launched before Monday at the earliest
because of the two problems, he said.
   ``Both of them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would
be optimistic to expect that,'' Sieck said.
   Among tens of thousands who had gathered for the planned rare
afternoon liftoff were prominent planetary scientists who have been
waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978, when
Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary expedition.
   ``We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few
extra days won't matter,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on
our way to Venus.''
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said James Head, a geologist from
Brown University.
   The space agency must send the Magellan probe on its way by May
28 to take advantage of the proper alignment between Earth and
Venus. If NASA can't meet that deadline, officials would have to
wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired
position.
   After the scrub was announced, the astronauts climbed out of the
spaceship in their bright orange launch suits and were taken back
to the crew quarters for a late lunch.
   The crew includes commander David Walker, along with pilot
Ronald J. Grabe, Mary L. Cleave, Norman E. Thagard and Mark C. Lee.
   Sieck said the preparations seemed ``picture perfect'' until 20
minutes before launch.
   A computer malfunction was quickly fixed and the count resumed
after a six-minute delay. Then, with fewer than 50 seconds left on
the clock, an engineer in the launch control room told Sieck,
``Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ...
recommend hold at T-minus 31.''
   The countdown was stopped.
   ``It just wasn't our day,'' Sieck said. He fretted out loud that
the weather, perfect on Friday, would likely be less ideal next
week.
   After it is released from Atlantis' cargo bay, Magellan will
rocket itself onto a 15-month, 806 million-mile path toward Venus,
the Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
   The explorer craft will spend eight months orbiting Venus and
mapping about 90 percent of the planet surface using a
sophisticated radar system.
   Venus is a cloud-shrouded world that has always intrigued
scientists because it is about the size of Earth, but lacks any of
the conditions that make life on this planet possible.

   A two-minute test of an experimental
space shuttle engine went flawlessly Saturday at the NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center after two earlier tests had to be shut down
abruptly, authorities said.
   An ear-piercing roar and huge clouds of white smoke rolled across
the test site at Marshall, followed by the applause of some 1,000
people who got a rare opportunity to watch the test. Marshall opened
its gates to the public to mark the 20th anniversary of man landing
on the moon, a mission that used rocket engines designed at Marshall.
   ``It went perfectly,'' Marshall Director Jack Lee said.
   NASA engineers said data from the test would be analyzed by
computers. They also said the engine's experimental enlarged throat
for the main combustion chamber may be a feature of space shuttles
by 1995.
   The throat is designed to allow the engine to run at lower
pressures and temperatures than now exist on the space shuttle.
   The last test on June 22 was automatically shut down after 40
seconds because nitrogen contaminated the engine's liquid hydrogen
system.

   In a corrugated metal complex that
reverberates with echoes of aerospace history, a team of 1,000
workers is building a replacement for the ill-fated space shuttle
Challenger.
   The new orbiter vehicle is as yet unnamed. It is a collection of
titanium forgings, machined parts and electronic boxes known at
this stage of production only as OV-105.
   Its letter-number designator sounds more fitting for a robot in
a ``Star Wars'' film than a spacecraft in a fleet of shuttles
bestowed the stately titles of Atlantis, Discovery and Columbia.
   ``It's not our job to give it a name,'' shuttle production chief
Seymour Z. Rubenstein of Rockwell International, the principal
shuttle contractor, said cheerfully in a recent interview. ``That's
the government's job.''
   Actually, the replacement shuttle's name will be the brainstorm
of school children who submit entries in a national competition
that opens this fall.
   After several elimination rounds, the administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration will select a winner
in May 1989, said Bill Green, a Rockwell International spokesman.
   Only one thing is certain about the name.
   ``It definitely won't be Challenger 2, or anything like that,''
Green said.
   While OV-105 waits for a name, about 100 subcontractors and
2,000 Rockwell shuttle program workers are giving the $1.3 billion
orbiter its shape in Downey, a suburb of Los Angeles, and in
Palmdale, the Mojave Desert city 50 miles north of Los Angeles
where final assembly is to take place.
   Already, the space vehicle's wings have sailed through the
Panama Canal from Grumman Corp. on New York's Long Island on their
journey to the Mojave Desert. The nozzles that guide the orbiter as
it flies through space hail from McDonnell Douglas Corp. in St.
Louis. Other key components are made at Rockwell facilities in
Oklahoma and Ohio, and additional parts are being flown in from
dozens of other locations across the United States.
   When the new shuttle is finished, it will look almost exactly
like the three others in the fleet.
   ``Essentially it will look the same,'' said Rubenstein,
president of Rockwell's Space Transportation Systems Division.
   That there are no drastic changes from previous shuttles is a
point of pride for Rubenstein, one of the principal original
designers of the shuttle.
   ``No other country could have built it,'' he said. ``It's a
well-designed product built by a tremendously dedicated work
force.''
   Even though it looks the same as earlier orbiters, it will
incorporate all the improvements found necessary by the Rogers
Commission, which investigated the launch disaster that took the
lives of the Challenger crew 2{ years ago.
   Most notable is a crew escape system _ a telescoping pole the
crew could use to slide down and then parachute to the ground or
into the water. Such a bailout system, a version of which was added
to Discovery before its current flight, could not have saved the
Challenger crew.
   The new shuttle also will have upgraded electronics and an
improved braking system, changes that also are being incorporated
into the rest of the shuttle fleet.
   Like its predecessors, OV-105 is taking shape in a complex where
the Apollo capsule and Apollo-Soyuz command modules were built.
Rockwell also built the X-15 rocket plane and the P-51 Mustang
fighter plane.
   ``This company is rich in aviation and space heritage,''
Rubenstein said., ``The company has a history of building aircraft
and spacecraft that were on the leading edge.''
   Congress gave the go-ahead to build the replacement shuttle on
July 31, 1987. It is scheduled to be delivered in April 1991 and
fly in space in 1992.
   Work on production and assembly of the new orbiter is nearly
half complete because the company got approval in 1983 to built a
set of ``structural spare parts.'' The spares were actually key
components of a shuttle superstructure that were to be used if a
shuttle was ever damaged.
   ``No one had planned on the loss of a vehicle,'' Rubenstein said.
   But, after Challenger, the spare parts functioned ``like an
insurance policy'' in speeding production of the replacement
orbiter. Many major shuttle components, like the aft fuselage
section, take as long as five years to machine because they must be
forged from titanium and measured to a high degree of precision.

   An astronaut scheduled to command a space
shuttle flight next year and two high NASA officials announced
their resignations Monday, with two saying their decisions were
prompted by new federal retirement regulations.
   Astronaut Jon A. McBride, 45, announced he will retire from NASA
on May 12 and will retire from the Navy in ``the near future.''
   Noel W. Hinners, the third-ranking executive in NASA, said he
will retire on May 14, the day before new post-retirement
regulations for government employees go into effect.
   James B. Odom, 55, chief of NASA's space station program,
announced he is retiring next Sunday and blamed the sudden decision
on ``the impact of some upcoming changes on government retirees.''
   McBride, a captain in the Navy, was scheduled to command the
STS-35 space shuttle mission set for launch next March. NASA
announced that veteran astronaut Vance D. Brand would take over
that job.
   McBride was selected as an astronaut in 1978 and flew into space
one time, as pilot on an October 1984 shuttle mission. He had been
scheduled to command a mission in March 1986, but the flight was
deferred when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the Jan. 28,
1986, explosion of space shuttle Challenger.
   ``I've spent an extremely rewarding 25 years with NASA and the
Navy,'' McBride said in a statement released by the Johnson Space
Center in Houston. ``This move has been a very difficult decision
for me. But in the final analysis, I felt it was time to make a
career change and return to West Virginia.''
   Hinners blamed his decision to retire on what he called
``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   A geologist and geochemist, Hinners served as chief scientist
for NASA. He began his space career in 1963 by helping to plan the
scientific exploration of the moon during the Apollo program. He
later served as director of the National Air and Space Museum in
Washington and director of the Goddard Space Flight Center. Hinners
joined the NASA senior management team in Washington in 1987.
   Odom, a 33-year veteran of NASA, has headed the space station
program for a year. The agency is in the midst of a major push to
persuade Congress to budget funds for starting construction on the
station.
   ``I regret the timing of my decision, but the impact of some
upcoming changes on government retirees made it such that I did not
get to pick the most desirable or optimum time to retire,'' said
Odom in a statement.
   Odom started his space career as a rocket engineer with the Army
in 1956, and transferred to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
1959. He helped to develop the external tank used on the space
shuttle and the space telescope which will be launched next year.
   A spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said that regulations going into effect May 15 will
restrict the freedom of retired NASA executives to go to work for
commercial aerospace companies.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, also said that some
NASA officials feel they must leave before the rules take effect
``to take care of their families.''
   ``There will probably be some more (resignations),'' the
spokesman said.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.

   A new countdown begins tonight for a
22-second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a
vital test that has been postponed five times because of
malfunctions.
   If this test succeeds, NASA officials will set a date for the
first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into
flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date,
already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before
October because of all the test delays.
   The flight readiness firing, as it's called, is an overall
workout of the main engines, computer software, ground support
equipment, communications lines and the launch teams.
   The ``call to stations'' that begins the countdown was scheduled
for 6:10 p.m. with the test set for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. Without
further problems, fueling of the shuttle's huge tank begins a half
hour before midnight.
   The shuttle's No. 2 engine is fitted with a new ``hydrogen bleed
valve'' and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to
be scrapped last Thursday in the split second before the start of
ignition.
   ``The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
Wednesday morning,'' said Hugh Harris, a spokesman for NASA's
Kennedy Space Center.
   Discovery's three engines will be fired with slightly different
start and stop times, using only a portion of the half million
gallons of fuel in the external tank.
   Bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to
the pad while the engines generate 1.1 million pounds of thrust.
   The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank
will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending
movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during
Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame to escape and led to
the shuttle's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts.
   Flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new
shuttles only, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest
necessary. But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is
treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time
since the last flight and the many changes since the Challenger
disaster.
   Last Thursday's engine test was aborted in the last second when
a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed
to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts.
   The designer of the shuttle rocket booster, meanwhile, announced
Monday that the last of five full-scale test-firings for the
booster will be held Aug. 18.
   The fifth in the series of firings of the 126-foot-long
redesigned rocket will be conducted at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s
northern Utah plant.

   NASA officials said Monday they still have not
pinpointed the mysterious hydrogen leak that grounded the space
shuttle fleet, even though engineers repeated the leak in
laboratory tests.
   Rockwell International engineers detected escaping hydrogen in a
weekend test of hardware from space shuttle Columbia, but NASA
space flight director William Lenoir said engineers still don't
know the precise valve, pipe or seal in the complex plumbing of the
liquid hydrogen rocket fuel system that is leaking.
   The Rockwell test, in effect, proved that the leak was related
to the design or assembly of the equipment. Lenoir said the next
step now is to find the exact source.
   ``My biggest fear was that we would go through the Downey test
and get no leak at all,'' said Lenoir. ``I'm encouraged.''
   Finding no leak, officials said, would have made the leak even
more puzzling and more difficult to repair.
   Space shuttle program director Robert Crippen cautioned that
although the leak discovery is important ``we really do not know
what the problem is yet. We haven't eliminated anything yet.''
   An even more important leak test is planned for Friday or
Saturday on space shuttle Atlantis, which is on a launch pad at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   Lenoir said the ``prime suspect'' for the source of the leak is
a U-shaped Teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from
leaking from what is called a disconnect. This disconnect is in a
17-inch hydrogen pipe that pulls apart when the shuttle rocket
propellant tank is jettisoned after launch.
   Rockwell engineers at the company's Downey, Calif., plant found
the leak during weekend tests when liquid hydrogen was pumped
through an apparatus of pipes, seals and valves, called an
umbilical, which had been removed from the shuttle Columbia.
   The umbilical carries rocket propellant from the shuttle's large
orange tank to the rocket engines in the orbiter, the winged
spacecraft that carries the astronauts. The 17-inch disconnect
separates halves of the umbilical.
   The umbilical also is used to load the fuel tank before launch.
The hydrogen leak on Columbia was first detected in May, when
technicians were pumping the supercold hydrogen on board. The
mission was postponed and the umbilical on Columbia was removed and
sent to Rockwell for testing.
   A second hydrogen leak was found on Atlantis last month. As a
precaution, NASA grounded all three shuttles until the leaks are
fixed.
   The Rockwell test was a laboratory experiment that did not
exactly duplicate the conditions that occurred when Columbia's leak
was detected, said Lenoir. He said it was a static test that
attempted to match the pressures and the minus 420 degree
temperature of liquid hydrogen, but it could not match the 84
gallon-a-minute flow used when the tank is being filled.
   The test late this week on Atlantis will match all conditions of
the earlier leaks. Lenoir and Crippen said that Atlantis' umbilical
is being outfitted with sensors and with plastic bags to capture
and detect leaking hydrogen. It is hoped that the test will help to
isolated the source of the leak.
   But Crippen noted, ``We have not eliminated the possibility that
we might have two different problems on the two different
vehicles.''
   Liquid hydrogen is at minus 420 degrees when it is pumped into
the shuttle fuel tank. Preflight tests of the umbilical had been
conducted in the past using liquid nitrogen or helium, both of
which are warmer than liquid hydrogen. The pipes and valves on
Columbia and Atlantis had passed the nitrogen and helium tests.
   It was only when the supercold hydrogen was pumped on board that
the leaks occurred.
   Rockwell engineers used liquid hydrogen, but NASA spokesman Kyle
Herring said the rate of flow in the laboratory experiment is
slower than what is used when the tank is being filled.
   The shuttles' main rocket engines burn liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen. The supercold chemicals are loaded into separate
vessels inside the propellant tank, the 153-foot-long tank attached
to the belly of the orbiter during launch.
   In Houston, meanwhile, NASA said it was grounding two veteran
shuttle crew commanders, Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson and
Navy Capt. David M. Walker, for violations of flight crew
operations guidelines.
   NASA said Gibson was removed from shuttle flight assignments and
from T-38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a
policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities for
astronauts named to flight crews.
   Gibson's stunt plane collided Saturday with another plane,
sending the second craft hurtling into a cornfield and killing its
pilot, Henry W. Jones Jr., 69, a retired fighter pilot.
   Walker was suspended for a May 1989 incident in which the pilot
of a Pan Am plane reported a ``near midair collision'' between his
aircraft and a T-38 flown by Walker.

   The nation's space agency will be led for the
first time by ``a hero of its own making,'' President Bush said in
announcing he will nominate astronaut Richard Truly as
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The nomination, which had been expected, must be confirmed by
the Senate.
   Truly, 50, has been an astronaut since 1969, was pilot of the
second shuttle flight in 1981 and commander of the eighth in 1983
and has been associate NASA administrator for space flight since
1986.
   Truly succeeds James C. Fletcher, a former NASA administrator
who resumed the position after the Challenger disaster in January
1986. Fletcher retired this month.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
NASA will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' Bush told members of Congress and others in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House on Wednesday.
   Bush also announced that he plans to nominate James R. Thompson
Jr., director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., to succeed Dale D. Myers as deputy administrator.
   Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man
crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle
Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet.
   He was commissioned an ensign in the Navy in 1959, became a
naval aviator in 1960 and made more than 300 carrier landings. He
now holds the rank of rear admiral.
   After the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986, Truly was in charge
of the recovery team and of redesigning the shuttle's boosters and
overhauling the shuttle safety program.
   B. Jay Cooper, deputy White House press secretary, said Congress
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of NASA be a
civilian.
   Bush said that immediately after the ceremonial announcement,
Truly was leaving for Cape Canaveral to take charge of the flight
readiness team for the next space shuttle flight, in which the
shuttle Atlantis will carry the Magellan radar mapping device into
space.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get Magellan on its way
to Venus.''

   A practice space shuttle countdown
hit a snag Monday, delaying a critical test-firing of Discovery's
three main engines 24 hours, until Sunday.
   The postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for
fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery
off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early
September launch by as much as two months.
   The launch team started the countdown late Sunday and fell
behind early in closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment
on the pad. That forced a one-day delay in the loading of gases
aboard the spaceship's energy-producing fuel cells.
   The plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million
gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Discovery's
external fuel tank late Wednesday and early Thursday.
   It will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
fleet was grounded by the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.
   On Thursday, when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock
liftoff, a simulated problem is to force a postponement. Crews then
will rehearse what they call a 72-hour launch turnaround exercise.
They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown and aim for
a test-firing of Discovery's main engines at 7:30 a.m. Sunday.
   The 20-second firing, with the shuttle locked firmly on the pad,
will check modifications made to turbopumps and other engine
systems and is considered crucial to Discovery being certified for
the first post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
September, but the date is uncertain because of the leak in a
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines.
   NASA officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the
pad, the launch will be delayed past the middle of September.
   Experts were considering several ways to reach and plug the
inaccessible leak, from cutting a hole through the shuttle cargo
bay wall to running a snake-like tube 20 feet through the
half-inch-diameter gas line.
   Tests over the weekend ruled out using the tube in two
configurations. One would have used it to deliver an expandable
Teflon balloon filled with sealant to plug the leak. In the other,
sealant would been pumped through a hollow tube to the leak.
   The tube testing is being done at the Materials and Processing
Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
Lab director Bob Schwinghamer said Monday the balloon and hollow
tube approaches proved impractical.
   But he said another approach, in which a badminton-like
shuttlecock is attached to the end of the ``snake,'' showed promise
in reaching the leak.
   ``We have tested it eight times successfully and it looks very
attractive,'' Schwinghamer said. He suggested that if this method
didn't work, NASA then could consider cutting a hole in the cargo
bay.

DOMINIC J. SANCHINI, RETIRED ROCKWELL OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dominic J. (Dom) Sanchini, a retired Rockwell Corp. vice president who helped 
develop the main engines for the space shuttle orbiters, died Saturday at his 
home in Thousand Oaks after a long battle with cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini, who was the second-ranking executive at Rockwell's Canoga Park-based 
Rocketdyne division until 1986, headed Rockwell's effort to obtain the 
government contract to build the shuttle orbiters' main engines, a company 
spokesman said. The main engines are attached to the rear of the orbiters to 
help guide the craft in space, and are separate from the booster rockets that 
launch the shuttle into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini retired in August as vice president-major programs at Rockwell's El 
Segundo headquarters. He had been employed by Rockwell for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Raritan, N. J., Sanchini served in the Navy from 1944 to 1947 and 
earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Lehigh 
University in 1951. He also earned a law degree in 1958 from USC and was a 
member of the State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Sanchini was named manager of Rockwell's effort to win the government 
contract to build the main engines of the shuttle orbiter, then in the planning 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded him its 
highest honor for non-federal personnel, the Distinguished Public Service 
Medal, for his contributions to the shuttle program. In 1983, Sanchini was 
named executive vice president-production for the entire Rocketdyne division. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini was president of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons production plant in 
Colorado from 1986 until last year, when Rockwell's contract with the 
Department of Energy was terminated. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini is survived by his wife, Claire; two daughters and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday at St. Jude's Catholic Church 
in Westlake Village. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be 
made to charities.

<HEAD>Post-Challenger Era Includes New Generation of Astronauts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying
two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a
look and background unlike that of the all-white, crew-cut, All
American team who rode the Mercury capsules.
   Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a
new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by
veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a
nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have
never flown into space.
   Within 10 years, NASA is expected to add more as it responds to
the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the
space station.
   America's new astronauts are far different from the seven
original ones.
   The first U.S. astronauts were all military test pilots, all male
and all white. All Jack Armstrongs in flight suits.
   The space shuttles, with room for up to seven crew members,
opened new opportunities.
   In 1978, NASA selected women and men, pilots and non-pilots, and
black, white, Hispanic and Asian candidates.
   The newest group, chosen last year, includes the first black
woman astronaut, Dr. Mae C. Jemison, a physician, and the first
Coast Guardsman, Bruce E. Melnick.
   Another group is scheduled to be chosen in January 1990. Despite
the loss of the seven Challenger astronauts, the number of
applications has increased since the accident, Johnson Space Center
spokesman Jeff Carr said.
   The competition seems to have stiffened over the years, said Lori
Garver, executive director of the National Space Society, a
Washington-based space advocacy group of about 20,000 people from
the general public.
   ``I don't know how it could get more competitve from the early
days, but it seems to have done just that,'' Ms. Garver said. ``They
have experience in all kinds of areas. (NASA) looks at the whole
person and what they have to offer.''
   The astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their
opinions about quality and safety since Challenger, said astronaut
Charles Bolden Jr., a Marine colonel. ``Now, people have no qualms
about speaking out,'' he said.
   When Challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts. More than a
dozen later retired. Some returned to their military branches;
others _ like Sally Ride, the first American woman in space _ left
NASA to pursue other careers.
   Fifteen people _ 10 military and five civilians _ were added to
the astronaut ranks in August 1987. Two of them are women, Ms.
Jemison and Jan Davis.
   It takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can
even be assigned to a flight, and crews generally are named a year
before their launch date, Ms. Davis said.
   ``I didn't understand before I came here how all-encompassing the
job is. We don't just flip switches and follow check lists. We've
got to understand what's going on with all these systems,'' said Ms.
Davis, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.
   Vance Brand, a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and
the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, said there has been an evolution of
sorts in the astronaut corps, with a greater diversity of skills and
backgrounds.
   Hee said he expects even more diversity in the future.
   ``Space is like the American West, the Arctic or Antarctica. It's
a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things,''
Brand said.

   Three women from the military,
including a student test pilot expected to be the first female
space shuttle pilot, are among 23 people selected as astronaut
candidates, NASA announced Wednesday.
   It marked the first time that female military officers have been
tapped as astronaut candidates, although some have applied for the
position in the past, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said.
   The list also includes Los Angeles native Ellen Ochoa, the first
female Hispanic selection.
   The three military women are Air Force Maj. Eileen M. Collins,
the first woman to be named a shuttle pilot candidate, Air Force
Capt. Susan J. Helms of Charlotte, N.C., and Army Capt. Nancy J.
Sherlock of Wilmington, Del. Helms and Sherlock were chosen as
mission specialist candidates.
   Collins, an Elmira, N.Y., native who is a student test pilot at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., also may become the first female to
command a shuttle mission. Shuttle pilots usually fly once as the
pilot before being named commander of a flight.
   In all, seven pilot candidates and 16 mission specialists were
selected from a list of 1,945 qualified applications. Last fall,
106 applicants were interviewed by NASA.
   The 23 astronaut candidates will train for a year beginning in
July before they are given technical jobs that lead to assignments
on shuttle missions.
   The astronaut candidates include Ronald M. Sega, the husband of
astronaut Bonnie Dunbar _ a mission specialist aboard the current
Columbia flight. Sega, a Cleveland native who is now a professor at
the University of Houston, was named a mission specialist.
   The other shuttle pilot candidates and their hometowns are:
Kenneth D. Cockrell of Austin, Texas; Air Force Capt. William G.
Gregory of Lockport, N.Y.; Air Force Maj. James D. Halsell Jr. of
Monroe, La.; Air Force Maj. Charles J. Precourt of Waltham, Mass.;
Air Force Maj. Richard A. Searfoss of Mount Clemens, Mich.; and
Marine Corps Maj. Terrence W. Wilcutt of Russellville, Ky.
   The other mission specialists and their hometowns are: Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Daniel W. Bursch of Bristol, Pa.; Leroy Chiao of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Army Maj. Michael R.U. Clifford of Norton Air Force Base,
Calif.; Bernard A. Harris Jr. of Temple, Texas; Thomas D. Jones of

   The crew of space shuttle Atlantis
successfully deployed a powerful radar satellite over the weekend,
reportedly the chief goal of the clandestine military mission,
knowledgeable sources said today.
   The $500 million Lacrosse satellite reportedly was designed to
gather extremely sharp all-weather images of Eastern Bloc military
targets and would help American intelligence agencies monitor Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said the satellite was
operating well as it followed a course that carries it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.
   They also reported that Atlantis was expected to return to Earth
Tuesday afternoon, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said it would
provide 24 hours advance notice of a landing time.
   As word about the satellite was reported, Atlantis' five
astronauts were beginning the fourth day of their mission and NASA
and the Air Force were keeping a tight lid on information about
their activities.
   Before today, there had been no in-flight information leaked to
news agencies as it was on two earlier Defense Department shuttle
missions.
   ``It seems the Air Force and NASA have learned how to plug the
leaks,'' said one official Sunday, on condition he not be named.
   Sources had said before Friday's launch from Cape Canaveral that
the flight would end today or Tuesday unless the crew needed more
time to deploy the radar satellite or to conduct other
military-oriented experiments.
   At Edwards, a ground crew Sunday conducted a simulated shuttle
landing, an exercise normally done a day or two before a mission
ends. But there was no announcement of a landing.
   Plans for the next shuttle flight, set for Feb. 18, received a
setback last week when part of a rocket for boosting a
communications satellite into orbit from the shuttle was badly
damaged.
   A worker bumped into the nozzle on the rocket's first stage and
cracked it during during pre-launch checks Thursday, and the entire
first stage will be replaced, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   Testing was to have begun Dec. 10 on the combined first and
second stages of the two-stage booster, he said. The tests will be
delayed until about Dec. 27, he said, and technicians probably would
have to work two shifts a day seven days a week to maintain the
launch schedule for the Discovery's mission, he said.
   The satellite deployed by the Atlantis' crew reportedly is to
serve someday as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber,
selecting potential targets. That would eliminate the need for the
aircraft to use its own radar, which might disclose its location.
   The astronauts also reportedly were to conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer in space,
with emphasis on reconnaissance. It was believed they were to test a
new optical device that resembles binoculars.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson commands the flight. The other crew
members are Col. Richard M. Mullane, Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and Lt.
Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   The mission is the 27th in the shuttle program, the third
dedicated solely to the military and the second since the 1986
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted flights
for 32 months.

   NASA rolled out a full-scale model of
its next generation space shuttle for public viewing Tuesday, with
hopes it will impress those holding the purse strings for the
nation's space program.
   The 115-foot mockup of the planned Shuttle-C, an unmanned,
cargo-carrying space shuttle, was put together in a hanger at
Marshall Space Flight Center for about $500,000.
   The model will be shown to visiting congressman and other VIPs,
and is expected to become part of bus tours through Marshall
operated by the Alabama Space and Rocket Center.
   It might also travel to NASA's Kennedy Space Center so
technicians can practice handling future space shuttle vehicles.
   ``It's more than just something to look at; it's a design tool
that our engineers will use in deciding how systems they're working
on will fit in full scale and how they would be used and ultimately
how we would handle something like Shuttle-C,'' said Larry Russell,
a Marshall engineer.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to get
the first funds for a $1.5 billion Shuttle-C development program in
its fiscal 1991 budget, with the program managed through Marshall.
   The center is responsible for development and management of the
space shuttle fleet's main engines, booster rockets and external
fuel tanks.
   As proposed by Marshall engineers, Shuttle-C would be a wingless
version of the existing space shuttles, using the same propulsion
systems, two shuttle main engines, external fuel tank and two solid
fuel booster rockets.
   Shuttle-C would weigh about 75,000 pounds empty, less than half
the weight of the 174,000-pound manned orbiters. It could carry
payloads in its 16-by-82-foot cargo bay as heavy as 145,000 pounds,
three times the weight current shuttles can lift.
   Unlike its manned counterparts, however, Shuttle-C could not be
reused and would be discarded like old booster rockets.
   ``We need a heavy lift vehicle to get major pieces of the space
station into orbit, and we think Shuttle-C is what we need,'' said
J.R. Thompson, Marshall director and deputy NASA
administrator-designate.
   NASA could fly a working version of Shuttle-C by 1994 if
congressional funding begins next year, Russell said.

<P>
Sanchez and about 14 other members of the Young Astronaut Program flew the 
paper planes in a contest Wednesday in the yard of the E.P. Foster Elementary 
School in Ventura.

<P>
The nationwide program for elementary and junior high school students promotes 
science, mathematics and space-related subjects. The effort is intended to help 
reverse the low proficiency levels of American students in these subjects, 
compared with children in other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The students' creations were judged by the school's principal and two reading 
specialists on the planes' distance, speed and fancy acrobatics. Using scissors 
and thin white paper, the students designed the planes, adding ridges and folds 
that enabled the aircraft to dip and glide in strange patterns. Paper clips 
mounted to the folds increased the planes' speed.

<P>
Sanchez's F-14 Tomcat, an intricately folded plane, earned him the title of 
overall winner and first place in the distance category and second place in 
acrobatics.

<HEAD>Many Differences Between U.S. And Soviet Space Shuttles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. space shuttle was never
equipped for an unmanned test flight like the one planned tonight
for the Soviets' look-alike orbiter. At the time, the program was
behind schedule, money was tight and the technology was not well
developed.
   NASA, however, says it had confidence that its design would work
the first time when the shuttle Columbia made its debut more than
seven years ago.
   Despite the striking resemblance of the two spacecraft, there are
numerous other differences between them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines will be on the Energia rocket
instead of on the reusable orbiter. The craft has small jet engines
that give it greater maneuverability for landing. And it has
liquid-fuel booster rockets instead of solid-fuel boosters like the
one that destroyed Challenger in January 1986, grounding the
American program for 32 months.
   The Soviet Union announced Wednesday that its shuttle would be
launched at 11:23 p.m. EDT today, or 6:23 a.m. Moscow time Saturday.
The shuttle is named Buran, Russian for snowstorm.
   Soviet officials said Buran's first flight would be pilotless to
avoid deaths in case of an accident like the Challenger explosion.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said its
decision to have two astronauts pilot the first U.S. shuttle
reflected engineers' confidence that it would work the first time,
but only if humans were aboard.
   Spacecraft in the earlier Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs
underwent extensive unmanned testing before men flew them.
   But the shuttle program was running three years behind schedule
and financial pressure on NASA was rising.
   Flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required
extensive and expensive changes to allow the automatic pilot to
respond to radio commands.
   Officials also noted that the American shuttle was built with the
technology of the early 1970s, when it would have been more
difficult to develop an automated landing system for so complex a
craft. The Soviets, coming along a decade later, could take
advantage of the latest developments.
   As a precaution, the U.S. shuttle included ejection seats for the
two pilots who flew early shakedown missions. But there was room for
only two such devices, and they were removed when crews expanded.
   The Soviet shuttle will be boosted into orbit by the new Energia
rocket, which can lift a 220,000-pound payload. That rivals the
power of America's huge Saturn 5 rocket, which was scrapped for
economy reasons after taking six Apollo crews to the moon.
   The liquid-hydrogen, liquid-oxygen booster has had only one test
flight, in May 1987. The Soviets called the test a success, even
though the payload failed to reach orbit. Several other technical
problems cropped up during the flight, and engineers worked for
months to correct them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines are attached to the Energia,
meaning they will be jettisoned and cannot be reused. On the U.S.
shuttle, the main motors are part of the orbiter and can be reflown
up to 55 times.
   By not carrying its engines, the Soviet shuttle can haul more
cargo than its U.S. cousin, about 66,000 pounds compared with 55,000
pounds. The disadvantage is that new, expensive powerplants have to
be built for each launch.
   Assisting the Soviet craft into space are four strap-on rockets,
also powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The U.S. vehicle
has two solid-fuel strap-on motors.
   After descending from orbit, the American shuttle becomes a
powerless glider. If it were unable to reach its runway, or if high
crosswinds or something else spoiled its final approach, the crew
would have to bail out and leave the vehicle to crash.
   The Soviet craft's two small jet engines would enable it to make
its final approach at a safer, shallower angle and allow greater
maneuverability, including the possibility of a second landing
attempt.
   NASA considered using jet engines for landing, but abandoned the
idea because of cost, weight and technical tradeoffs.

   NASA rejected a bidder on the Hubble Space
Telescope that planned tests to detect focusing flaws and instead
picked a company that proposed no such tests and made mirrors with
a fuzzy view of the universe, a space agency official says.
   Eastman Kodak Co., in its effort to win the contract to build
the Hubble mirrors, proposed a ``final assembly testing'' of the
telescope optics, NASA Deputy Administrator James R. Thompson told
a Senate panel Tuesday.
   NASA, however, gave the contract to Perkin-Elmer Corp., now
Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which did not plan the fully
assembled tests, and the agency chose not to order the tests
because they were so expensive, Thompson said.
   The Hubble Telescope, now in orbit, is disabled because of a
focusing flaw that might have been found by tests proposed in the
Kodak bid.
   ``In retrospect, perhaps an all-systems test could have been
done or should have been done,'' Thompson told the science and
space subcommittee.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
declined to say why Perkin-Elmer was selected for the Hubble
contract, but NASA spokesman Bill Sheehan said ``Perkin-Elmer had,
on balance, more strength.''
   Perkin-Elmer's experience in building spy satellites may have
been a factor, other sources said.
   The Danbury, Conn., firm's winning bid in 1977 was for $63.4
million, but the total value of the contract swelled through cost
overruns and changes to $451 million. Almost $20 million of that
was paid by NASA as award fees, which are given based on
performance evaluation.
   Stephen Beale, a NASA procurement officer, said an additional
$4.3 million in award fees for the company are under consideration.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who chaired the hearing, charged that
NASA's recent problems with a crippled telescope and a space
shuttle fleet grounded by hydrogen leaks may be related to an
agency ``mindset to reject any pessimistic news.''
   Gore said Congress was ``no longer going to be satisfied'' with
what he called ``NASA's proclivity to shoot the messenger and not
give credence to troublesome studies.''
   He said the agency, for instance, rejected some studies
predicting that within the next decade there could be another
accident like the Challenge explosion that killed seven astronauts
in 1986.
   Thompson, in a heated exchange, called the charge unfair.
   He said NASA recognized that there are risks in space flight and
that another space shuttle could be lost eventually.
   ``If you fly 100 times and I tell you that we're not going to
lose another one, that wouldn't pass the sanity test,'' said
Thompson. ``If we fly 100 more, we may lose another one.''
   But he added: ``I think the chance is very, very low with the
team we have in place.''
   Meanwhile, Hubble Space Telescope experts told a news conference
that they have moved closer to determining which of two mirrors on
the observatory spacecraft had been cut to the wrong prescription.
   ``All of the evidence is beginning to point toward the primary
mirror and not the secondary mirror,'' said Ed Weiler, chief
project scientist for the Hubble.
   The telescope has two mirrors, a 94-inch primary and a 12-inch
secondary, that are suspects in the focusing flaw that has
handicapped Hubble. Experts are working to determine which mirror
is flawed. This will help make corrective optics for a replacement
camera that will be installed by 1993.
   If the primary mirror is at fault, Weiler said, it will be
easier to correct than if the problem was in the secondary mirror.
The secondary mirror reflects light from the primary mirror into
the telescope's instruments.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- The launch of the U.S. 
"Discovery" space shuttle on which a Russian cosmonaut is to 
make the first flight was postponed from January 20 to February 
3 because of malfunctions in the craft's engines, TASS learned 
from reliable sources in the Russian space business on Monday. 
  35 year-old Sergey Krikalyov is the first Russian cosmonaut 
to fly on board the U.S. space shuttle, according to a 
U.S.-Russian agreement. 
  Krikalyov made two space flights on the Russian "Mir" space 
station, the first lasted for 151 days in 1988-1989 and the 
second - 312 days from May 1991 to March 1992. 
  Krikalyov who was trained for the shuttle flight in the 
United States said the Russian training programme is better in 
many aspects. 
  Krikalyov, who is a computer engineer, said the computers 
installed on the "Discovery" had been designed long ago and are 
considerably inferior to the computer centre onboard the "Mir". 
  He also complained about an inconvenient work schedule in 
orbit - in two shifts. There is only one sleeping-bag for two 
crew members and they have to sleep in turn, according to him. 
  Krikalyov was surprised that after the training programme 
was 
completed astronauts did not have to pass any exams or tests. 
It is the captain who bears all responsibility for the flight 
preparations. 
  This is the second delay in the launch of the space shuttle. 
Initially it was planned for last November 10, but was also 
postponed.

<HL> Space Shuttle Has New Flaw; Test Is Aborted --- Valve Fails to Close Properly Or Is Misread by Sensor; Week's Delay Is Possible </HL>

   The ill-starred space shuttle program suffered yet another embarrassment. 

   A moment before the space shuttle Discovery's three main engines were set to fire in a crucial test yesterday, an electronic engine controller automatically aborted the test. 
The controller sensed that engine No. 2 -- a new engine that had never flown in space -- hadn't closed a critical valve fast enough and might leak pressurized fuel. 
At worst, such a leak could rupture the engine. 

   Scrubbing the test is the latest in a series of setbacks that have pushed the launching of Discovery far behind schedule. 
This spring the National Aeronautics and Space Administration confidently predicted an August liftoff, and the agency still contends it can make it in September. 
But now even October seems optimistic. 
NASA has said it won't set a date until after it successfully completes the test firing. 

   NASA first must figure out whether the shuttle engine actually malfunctioned or a sensor merely misread the situation. 
The agency suspended the test until Sunday but said the delay could stretch until late next week depending on the severity of the problem. 

   Boyce Mix, resident manager of NASA's Stennis Test Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., where the engines are tested, said NASA hopes to decide today how to repair the problem. 
The critical valve, an engine leak-valve, must be at least 80% closed before firing, NASA officials said, but in the test yesterday, according to the electronic controller, it had closed only 76%. 

   Joseph Lombardo, project manager for the shuttle engines, said that NASA will remove the valve and sensor assembly if they are found faulty. 
That would take about a week. 
Alternatively, he said, NASA might decide to change the software controlling the valve. 
That would take just a few days. 

   Engine problems can sometimes lead to big delays. 
During 1984, for instance, NASA delayed the maiden launch of Discovery for two months when it discovered an engine problem one second after the engines ignited. 
NASA closed down the launch and later pulled the shuttle back to the assembly building, where workers replaced an engine. 

   Neither of the changes contemplated by NASA would require the shuttle to be rolled off the launching pad. 
But NASA faces additional delays because of a small fuel-line leak in a steering rocket. 
NASA wants to repair the leak on the launching pad by cutting into the shuttle and clamping the leak. 
But it hasn't attempted such a repair on the pad before. 

   NASA had hoped to make yesterday's test firing a kind of confirmation party for the shuttle. 
The space agency rolled the Discovery out of its hangar on July 4, a stirring sight that television news shows used as an optimistic counterpoint to stories about the U.S. Navy downing an Iranian passenger plane. 
A successful test firing, which evaluates how spacecraft equipment performs under launch stress, would have demonstrated NASA's renewed technical prowess. 

   About 50 reporters showed up to observe the 7:30 a.m. firing from a grandstand three miles from the launching pad. 
NASA set up a souvenir stand nearby, and NASA workers watched the countdown from the roof of the flight control center, about a quarter-mile away. 

   The countdown started flawlessly. 
The escape walkway that astronauts use in case of disaster pulled back at seven minutes before ignition; the on-board computers switched on at 30 seconds before firing. 
But then, at five seconds before launch, just when the main engines were to begin firing, the countdown shut down, the escape hatch jumped back into position, and NASA, once more, had to figure out what had gone wrong with the shuttle. 

   No U.S. astronauts have been lofted since Jan. 28, 1986, when the shuttle Challenger exploded after liftoff and its seven crewmembers were killed.

   Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early Monday on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad
and a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight since
the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving Fourth of July crowd of several hundred space
workers cheered as the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly
building at 12:50 a.m., riding upright on the broad back of a giant
tracked transporter called a crawler.
   The 4.2-mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six
to seven hours. Attached to Discovery were a 154-foot-tall external
fuel tank and the two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets that will
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early September.
   As the rollout began, Kennedy Space Center director Forrest S.
McCartney presented astronaut Dave Hilmers, one of Discovery's five
assigned crew members, with an autograph book containing the names
of 15,240 engineers, technicians, managers, secretaries, clerical
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the
shuttle fleet to flight.
   The astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them.
   McCartney, Hilmers and other NASA officials watched the rollout
from a flag-bedecked grandstand outside the assembly building.
   The early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year.
   Center officials originally said all five of Discovery's
astronauts and NASA administrator James C. Fletcher would be here
for the rollout. But four of the crew members elected to spend the
holiday weekend with their families in Houston, and Fletcher's
office said Friday he couldn't make it.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. All
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion.
   Since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the
shuttle main engines and other systems.
   Once at the pad, Discovery will be readied for a critical July
24 test of modifications to the three main liquid-fuel engines.
With the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the power
plant will be ignited for 19.4 seconds at the end of a practice
countdown.
   The following day, one final pre-flight test-firing of a
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the Morton Thiokol plant in
Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery is certified for
flight.
   On Sunday, a test of an intentionally damaged version of the
shuttle rocket's redesigned joint was apparently successful, Morton
Thiokol said. The test was conducted at a plant near Brigham City,
Utah.
   ``It appears no gas leaked outside the joint, in spite of the
very severe intentional flaws,'' said Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
``That has really raised our confidence for the (full-scale) test
at the end of the month.''
   The 1 p.m. MDT test was performed on a simulator that uses three
shortened rocket cases, two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to
mimic pressures present during when a full-scale rocket motor is
fired.
   Last week, NASA announced that it had changed the liftoff date
from late August to early September because it was taking longer
than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the
controls when Discovery blasts off to mark what NASA is counting on
to revive America's manned space program. The others are Commander
Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George Nelson.
   During their four-day mission, the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite, conduct scientific and technical
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems.

President Bush had lots of company as he saluted the nation's space effort. "We 
are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our space program and 
really of our country itself, of America herself," Bush said as he shared a 
White House stage with five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth-graders and nine 
junior and senior high school students. The astronauts were David M. Walker, 
Ronald J. Grabe, Norman E. Thagard, Mark C. Lee and Mary L. Cleave, who 
returned May 8 from a four-day mission aboard the shuttle Atlantis. The 18 
students, nine each from Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss., and 
Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Ga., had submitted the winning name, 
Endeavour, for the shuttle being built to replace Challenger, which exploded in 
1986. Endeavour, which will have the British spelling, was the name of the 
flagship used by 18th-Century English explorer James Cook. Bush said that more 
than 6,100 teams formed by 71,650 students submitted research projects 
supporting proposed names for the shuttle. Education agency panels picked state 
winners and Bush made the final selection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, is trying to decide whether to 
mind his mother. The younger Bush, speaking to the Austin Young Republicans, 
said he is still mulling over a run for Texas governor, even though his mother, 
Barbara, has advised him to stick to running the Texas Rangers baseball team 
that he bought into recently. "For 42 years my mother has been giving me 
advice," he said. "I've listened to her about 10% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- TV viewers in Tennessee are laying odds that their governor, Ned McWherter, 
won't be looking for a sure bet any time soon. McWherter has taken a public 
stand against legalized gambling in his state but WTVF, a Nashville television 
station, showed film of him making wagers with friends at a steeplechase race. 
"I guess the governor ought not to be out here," he told the station after 
tucking his money into a shirt pocket. "I just try to be like the average 
citizen." McWherter likened his betting at the race to office pools on the 
World Series or the Kentucky Derby. SHIRLEY MARLOW

   Engineers have fixed a leak
discovered in a hydrogen fuel line on space shuttle Discovery, which
is being prepared for a late February launch.
   NASA said the leak, detected Thursday, was caused by a fuel line
misalignment that was quickly corrected once the source was known.
It was in a 2-inch line in a section that connects the shuttle to
its external fuel tank.
   Discovery's target launch date is Feb. 23, but preparations have
been running slightly behind schedule and officials said earlier
this week they expected a delay of at least two days.
   The delay could be longer if engineers don't learn why a part
cracked in a main engine during Atlantis' liftoff in December. They
believe two tiny cracks found in a turbopump during post-flight
inspection were caused by stress corrosion, apparently resulting
from moisture that somehow penetrated the metal.
   Until they discover the source of the moisture, NASA will not
clear Discovery for flight. Officials have expressed confidence the
problem will be resolved in time to meet a February launch date.
   If it isn't, NASA is considering other options, including
postponing the Discovery flight until after an Atlantis mission set
for liftoff in April.
   NASA has said that if Discovery can't get off the only launch pad
available by March 14, it would postpone that mission until after
the Atlantis launch because the Atlantis crew has only a 25-day
period starting April 28 during which it can deploy the Magellan
payload to probe the planet Venus.
   Magellan has priority over Discovery's communications satellite
because Venus will not be in position again to receive a visitor
from Earth until May 1991.
   Meanwhile, in Huntsville, Ala., a space shuttle engine firing
test scheduled at Marshall Space Flight Center was delayed after a
problem was found in the engine control box, NASA officials said.
   The problem was discovered late Wednesday as workers completed
last-minute checks, said Len Worlund, deputy director of the
center's propulsion laboratory.
   NASA spokesman Jim Sahli said today that the shuttle flight
schedule would not be affected by the delay since the engine is in
the developmental stages.
   The 45-second firing, which was scheduled for Thursday afternoon,
was to be the last of three preliminary tests before engineers begin
a program to explore new engine technology. The test has been
postponed until next week.
   The engine control box, or controller, regulates all valves in
the engine and monitors temperature, pressure and other conditions.

With Buddhist blessings and bittersweet memories, a 27-foot-long replica of the 
space shuttle Challenger was unveiled in Little Tokyo on Friday in honor of 
Col. Ellison Onizuka, one of seven crew members who died in the shuttle 
explosion more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One-tenth the size of the Challenger, the memorial stands in the middle of a 
plaza named after Onizuka, the first Asian-American in space. 
</P>
<P>
"With this project now fixed to the street that bears his name, all of you have 
given my husband, Ellison Onizuka, a very proud sense of permanence here in the 
City of Angels," said his widow, Lorna, before she pulled a cord unveiling the 
fiberglass model with the help of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and several 
astronauts from the American and Japanese space programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for remembering with me and my children and my family a man who 
gently touched our lives in very special ways and then went away," said 
Onizuka. 
</P>
<P>
So true in detail is the monument that astronaut Col. Loren Shriver quipped 
that "if we have too many more problems with (the space shuttle) Columbia and 
hydrogen leaks, we may come and ask the committee if we can borrow this shuttle 
and use it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Money for the $250,000 memorial is being raised by the local Japanese-American 
community. The replica sits atop a black granite base with a bronze plaque, 
bearing a large relief bust of Onizuka, and an inscription in English and 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Born and raised in a simple rural community, he walked a remarkable path that 
led from the coffee fields of Kona, Hawaii, to miles above the earth," reads 
part of the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Challenger launch was the second space flight for the 39-year-old 
Onizuka. Less than two minutes after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger 
exploded, killing all seven aboard.

   NASA launched the space shuttle for
the first time nearly 10 years ago. Thirty-six flights have
followed, with another one - the 38th - planned for December.
   As of the end of November, 120 people had flown on the shuttle,
some of them several times. Seven were killed. One of four orbiters
was destroyed.
   Here are some of the highlights of America's shuttle program:
   April 12, 1981 - Columbia blasts off on the first shuttle
flight, putting Americans back in space after six years. The
mission lasted 54 hours.
   Nov. 12, 1981 - Columbia returns to space as the first reusable
spaceship.
   Nov. 11, 1982 - Columbia carries two communications satellites
into orbit, the first time a manned spaceship has a commercial
cargo.
   June 18, 1983 - Sally Ride becomes the first American woman to
fly in space.
   Aug. 30, 1983 - Guion Bluford Jr. becomes the first black to fly
in space.
   Nov. 28, 1983 - The first non-astronauts go into space, one of
them the first foreigner launched in a U.S. spaceship. It is also
the first Spacelab mission.
   Feb. 7, 1984 - Bruce McCandless II becomes the first person to
fly free in space, without being tethered to a craft. Two hours
later, Robert Stewart becomes the second.
   April 10, 1984 - George Nelson and James van Hoften perform the
first satellite repair in orbit, replacing a failed control system
and bad electronics box on the Solar Max spacecraft.
   Nov. 8, 1984 - Discovery lifts off on the first satellite
retrieval mission. Two communications spacecraft are snared from
orbit and returned to Earth.
   April 12, 1985 - The first politician, U.S. Sen. Jake Garn,
flies in space.
   July 29, 1985 - One of Challenger's three main engines shuts
down 5 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, forcing an
abort-to-orbit, in which a shuttle is sent into a lower orbit than
planned. It is the first in-flight engine cutoff.
   Nov. 29, 1985 - The first construction work is performed in
space. Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring assemble and disassemble a
beam and pyramid to test techniques being developed for building a
space station. They perform a similar spacewalking demonstration
two days later.
   Jan. 28, 1986 - Challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight,
killing all seven aboard. It is America's second space tragedy. The
1967 Apollo spacecraft fire, which killed three, was the first.
   Sept. 29, 1988 - America returns to space as Discovery blasts
off with five astronauts.
   May 4, 1989 - The first planetary probe - Venus-bound Magellan -
is launched from a shuttle.
   April 25, 1990 - The Hubble Space Telescope is deployed from
Discovery. NASA calls the orbiting observatory the greatest advance
in astronomy since Galileo's telescope.
   May 29, 1990 - Columbia's countdown is halted six hours before
liftoff when hydrogen fuel leaks from the shuttle.
   June 29, 1990 - Atlantis also is found to have hydrogen leaks,
