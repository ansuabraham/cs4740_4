   Two centuries after the United States was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119
million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.
   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater New York metro area while
the southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.
   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recent
years, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patterns
between 1980 and 1987.
   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the
1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
Midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in
much of the interior of the United States, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.
Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
July 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5
million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;
Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1
million; Dallas, 3.7 million;
   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9
million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,
2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;
Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;
   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9
million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,
1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;
Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;
   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;
Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;
Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,

1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.

   A new study concludes that skewing the Census
Bureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms
by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little
difference in the allocation of House seats.
   Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift
of 18 or more seats, various experts agree.
   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift
a maximum of just four additional seats among California,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P.
O'Hare reports.
   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference
in the overall apportionment of Congress,'' O'Hare reported in the
latest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private
Population Reference Bureau.
   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the
Constitution to redistribute the 435 House seats, keeping them
relatively even in population. Because the number of House members
is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose
one.
   Last year the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census
Bureau, decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted.
Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.
Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to
force changes.
   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people
who are ``imputed.''
   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census
officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker
repeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.
   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn by New York; Los Angeles; Chicago;
Dade County, Fla.; the NAACP and groups representing Hispanics and
the nation's mayors.
   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,
was filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh by the Immigration
Reform Law Institute on behalf of 42 members of Congress,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Alabama and the Federation for American
Immigration Reform.
   An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5
percent of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each
state by a predetermined percentage.
   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large
minority populations, but O'Hare's calculations said that would not
be the case.
   ``Interestingly,'' concluded O'Hare, ``minority undercount
adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has
received the most attention, would not result in the movement of
any seats between states.''
   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens
from the count would result in the transfer of one House seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 census
figures for California included an estimated 1 million illegal
aliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the California
population would cost that state a House seat; Pennsylvania would
be next in line for that seat.
   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more
imputed people than others, O'Hare found. He estimated that
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost Kentucky a
seat. Once again, the gainer would be Pennsylvania.
   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations of
these adjustments:
   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from Minnesota to
Pennsylvania.
   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would
transfer seats from Kentucky and Minnesota to Pennsylvania and
California.
   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move
one House seat from California to Pennsylvania.
   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition to
reallocartions of House seats caused by discernable shifts in
population since 1980.
   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,
the Population Reference Bureau and the private Election Data
Service have projected changes based on recent Census Bureau
population estimates.
   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern
states to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.
   Gainers are expected to be: California, 5; Texas, 4; Florida, 3;
Arizona, 2; Georgia, 2; North Carolina, 1 and Virginia, 1.
   Expected to lose seats are: New York, 3; Pennsylvania, 3;
Illinois, 2; Michigan, 2; Ohio, 2; Iowa, 1; Kansas, 1;
Massachusetts, 1; Montana, 1; West Virginia, 1, and Wisconsin, 1.

   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by 42
congressmen and three states seeking to block the counting of
illegal aliens in the 1990 census, in part because they could not
prove they will lose seats in Congress by reapportionment.
   The plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal aliens
would get a disproportionate number of House seats and electoral
votes, thus diminishing the political power of states with fewer
illegal aliens.
   The Census Bureau argued it is constitutionally obligated to
count everyone, including illegal aliens, for congressional
apportionment and has done so since the first census in 1790. House
seats are redistributed every 10 years to reflect population
changes.
   U.S. District Judge William L. Standish said, in a ruling filed
late Monday, that the plaintiffs cannot show they would be hurt by
the 1990 census because ``they are unable to establish how many
illegal aliens will be present ..., in which states these illegal
aliens will reside, or to what extent the illegal population will
come forward to be counted.''
   The lawsuit was filed last year by the congressmen, led by
Pennsylvania Republican Tom Ridge, and the states of Pennsylvania,
Kansas and Alabama.
   Ridge said Tuesday that Standish dismissed the lawsuit ``on
technical, legal grounds and not on the merits of the Census
Bureau's plans.''
   Ridge, recently named vice chairman of a House subcommittee that
oversees the Census Bureau, said he may appeal Standish's decision
and will introduce legislation in Congress to change the method of
the 1990 count.
   Standish's opinion noted that the congressmen's demographer
offered estimates that up to 5.6 million illegal aliens will be
counted in 1990. The demographer predicted a gain of up to four
congressional seats for California and one seat for Texas, and the
possible loss of one seat each for Georgia, Wisconsin, North
Carolina, Minnesota and Michigan.
   The judge noted another congressional analyst had predicted
gains for California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida at the
expense of Pennsylvania, Kansas, West Virginia and Alabama.
   But, the judge said, ``Based on the evidence offered, it is
sheer speculation as to the identities of the states that will be
affected by the inclusion of illegal aliens.''
   Standish also said the state governments of Pennsylvania, Kansas
and Alabama cannot show they would be damaged by ``reduced power or
prestige'' with the loss of congressional representation. He said
only the residents of the states might suffer and they did not file
the lawsuit.
   Standish noted that the non-profit Federation of American
Immigration Reform, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed a similar
legal action in 1980 that was dismissed by a three-judge federal
panel in the District of Columbia.
   Ridge was joined by 19 colleagues from Pennsylvania, and others
from Kansas, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Wisconsin,
Alabama, California and Maryland.

   The flow of Americans to California has pushed
the Golden State far ahead of all rivals in population and will
give it a record 52 seats in the 1992 House of Representatives, new
census figures indicate.
   Preliminary 1990 population figures show California picking up
seven House seats, followed by Florida with four, Texas three and a
handful of other warm-weather states with one each.
   New York hung on to its No. 2 ranking in population behind
California in the new figures _ with Texas and Florida closing fast
in third and fourth places _ but will lose three seats in Congress
because its population rose only slightly in the 1980s.
   Four Northern industrial states _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ lost population during the decade and will have two
fewer seats each.
   The Census Bureau estimated a national count of just under 246
million, including 29.3 million in California, 17.6 million in New
York, 16.8 million in Texas and 12.8 million in Florida. Wyoming
was last, at just under 450,000, passed by Alaska, which had the
smallest population in 1980 but grew to almost 546,000 in 1990.
   The total population count in 1980 was 226,545,805.
   House seats are redistributed among the states after each
Census. Because the number is limited to 435 seats, when a growing
state gains a seat some other state must lose one.
   New York's slight population gain was quickly disputed by state
officials, who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be
undercounted.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said in Albany. ``Do
you really, honestly believe that everybody who should be counted
has been counted? The answer is of course not. My mother had
trouble; she didn't want to answer.''
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins called the city's estimated
slight decline ``unadulterated nonsense'' and promised to pinpoint
where he said the government had made errors.
   Overall 19 House seats will change states according to the
figures, which could change significantly before the final report
is issued Dec. 31.
   The widely noted movement of Americans to the Sun Belt was
documented anew in the Census Bureau figures. Besides California,
Florida and Texas, states gaining a House seat each were Arizona,
Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   Besides the two-seat losers _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ there will be one less seat each for Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West
Virginia.
   Overall, the preliminary Census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683 residents. That's somewhat below
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year.
   However, 4 million or more may be added as the Census Bureau
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the
final reports are made public. If those are added in only a few
states, some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could
shift again.
   For example, a study by the private firm Election Data Services
showed Kentucky and Mississippi neck and neck for the last seat
allocated. Mississippi got the seat, but a shift of 3,000 people
could shift it to Kentucky.
   Kimball Brace, head of EDS, stressed that the figures are
subject to change.
   In addition to changes made after local officials assess the
preliminary figures, there is a chance that the final report could
be adjusted next summer.
   The bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in
the past and is conducting a post-census check on its count this
time. If officials determine that some group has been missed a
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers.
   That ruling will be made by the Department of Commerce in
mid-July 1991.
   The national total was completed Wednesday with the reports for
the final four states _ New York, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
   Census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to
allow local governments to question the results in the event people
were missed or overcounted.

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday
when the Census Bureau estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the South,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
Census Bureau in February.
   With the release of numbers for New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania
and Texas, the Census Bureau completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states.
   Overall, the preliminary census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683. Ten years ago, the census set the
nation's population at 226,545,805.
   To no one's surprise, the numbers showed Americans continued to
move South and West during the past 10 years.
   Nineteen U.S. House seats will follow that population shift to
the Sun Belt.
   That trend was good news for Republicans, who consider the Sun
Belt the area of their strongest growth. But a similar trend in the
1980 Census, when 17 House seats shifted South and West, failed to
yield expected GOP gains because most of the state legislators who
drew the new district lines were Democrats.
   The big winner when the shift takes place in time for the 1992
election will be California, which is expected to gain seven new
House seats for a total of 52. With a population expected to push
close to 30 million, California would have 21 more House seats than
the second-largest state, New York.
   Based on the preliminary population figures, Florida would gain
four House seats and Texas three. Picking up one each would be
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   New York would lose three House seats and Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Illinois two each. Losing one seat each would be Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia.
   Officials who think the Census Bureau missed a lot of people in
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support
claims they were undercounted.
   Mayor David Dinkins of New York called the estimate that his
city lost 40,000 people ``unadulterated nonsense'' and pledged to
``comb through the bureau's data to locate those areas where the
count is too low, identifying housing units the bureau overlooked
and buildings it missed entirely.''
   ``Do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted
was counted?'' Cuomo asked. Answering his own question, the
governor said, ``Of course not. My mother had trouble. She didn't
want to answer.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the House Democratic
group monitoring reapportionment, urged local officials to
challenge the preliminary figures.
   ``Now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells,'' said
Fazio. ``But when a Republican administration is on a track leading
us to a less than fair and accurate census count, Democrats must
challenge at every opportunity available.''
   Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a consulting
firm that analyzes census data for Democratic state legislators,
told a news conference that the figures were subject to
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final
numbers on Dec. 31. Even then, the Commerce Department will have
until July 15, 1991, to determine whether to adjust for an
undercount.
   Brace said he understood the Census Bureau has found up to 4
million additional people but has not yet included them in the
state figures. He said no estimate was available on where those
people are distributed among the states.
   Brace cited Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee as states where
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates.

   If the two sides trying to force changes in
the 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearly
balance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
   The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens
from its national head count. Traditionally, it counts everyone
living in the country.
   Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large
concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats
in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.
   Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be
increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census
_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
   At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed
among the states on the basis of population.
   ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a
flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said William
O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population
Reference Bureau.
   O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwest
members of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14
House seats following the 1990 census. That would continue a trend
evident over the last several decades, he noted.
   Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted
minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the
other would make little difference in the long run.
   The only change, he said, would be that California would gain
five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather
than just one.
   ``That's easy to understand, since there are so many
undocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
   O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on
1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to be
the big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with a
gain of four and Texas adding three.
   Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina,
Georgia, and Arizona.
   On the other hand New York would lose three seats. States losing
two apiece would be Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.

   The fast-growing San Diego metropolitan area
jumped two spots to surpass both Baltimore and Pittsburgh last year,
the Census Bureau reports.
   New population estimates for the nation's metropolitan areas show
few changes among the top 25 urban areas, with New York still firmly
in first place, followed by Los Angeles and Chicago.
   The biggest move among the 25 largest communities was by San
Diego, which rose from 19th in 1987 to 17th last year. It added
84,100 people, climbing to 2,370,400 metro-area residents.
   That pushed the Southern California city past Baltimore and
Pittsburgh. Baltimore was listed with 2,342,500 residents, up 31,900
from the year before, and Pittsburgh declined 7,900, to 2,284,100.
   Not far down the list, fast-growing Phoenix pushed past the
burgeoning Tampa-St. Petersburg region.
   Phoenix added 51,500 residents over the year to climb to
2,029,500 and rise one spot to the nation's 20th largest metro area.
Tampa-St. Petersburg dropped to 21st, despite a gain of 38,000
people for a 1988 total of 1,995,100.
   While revised 1987 figures contained in the new report indicate
that Phoenix actually moved ahead of Tampa-St. Petersburg in that
year, the Florida metropolitan area had been listed as the larger of
the two on the basis of preliminary 1987 estimates.
   The Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., metro area edged up
one spot to 24th, passing Milwaukee-Racine, which fell to 25th.
   The calculations are for metropolitan areas, which are officially
defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget. These
regional designations are used for federal statistical purposes.
Generally they consist of central cities of at least 50,000 people
and the surrounding regions that are economically interrelated.
   Here is a rundown on the nation's 25 most populous metropolitan
areas, their estimated populations as of 1988, and the change from
the year before.

   With political strength following population,
new 1990 Census projections give California, Texas and Florida a
rosy outlook.
   California would jump to 50 members of the House, a gain of
five, according to an analysis by the Library of Congress.
   David C. Huckabee of the Library's Congressional Research
Service recalculated the House distribution based on the new Census
Bureau projections of populations in 1990. The estimates were
released Thursday.
   Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based on
estimates, and a very small change in population can shift a House
seat from one state to another.
   In 1970, for example, a difference of fewer than 300 people gave
Oklahoma rather than Connecticut an additional House seat, he said.
   With House seats limited to 435, every gain by one state means a
loss for another.
   In addition to California, Huckabee calculated that Texas would
gain four new seats in the House and Florida would gain three.
   Adding two seats would be Arizona and Georgia, while North
Carolina and Virginia would each pick up one.
   On the other hand, New York and Pennsylvania would each drop
three seats, he calculated. Losing two apiece would be Illinois,
Michigan and Ohio. Expected to lose one would be Iowa, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Montana, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Huckabee's figures differ slightly from those of William O'Hare
at the private Population Reference Bureau, who used a different
set of 1990 estimates.
   Election Data Services, a private consulting firm, also issued
somewhat different reapportionment estimates earlier this year,
based on 1987 Census estimates.

<HEAD>Census Shows 249.6 Million Americans; Sun Belt Still a Gainer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and West.
   The Census Bureau's first ``final'' figures from the 1990
census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to Congress so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next summer when the Commerce
Department decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins criticized the count released
Wednesday, saying it underestimated the city's population and as a
result will cost the city millions of dollars in federal funds each
year.
   ``Since at least 1940, the Commerce Department and the Census
Bureau have systematically under counted Americans of color and
Americans who live in cities,'' Dinkins said at a City Hall news
conference.
   The Census Bureau's final national population total was nearly 4
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier
this year.
   Five states, all in the South or West, grew by more than a
fourth in the decade: Nevada, up 50.7 percent; Alaska, 37.4
percent; Arizona, 35.3 percent; Florida, 33.4 percent; and
California, 26.1 percent.
   The six states having growth of less than 1 percent included
some industrial powerhouses: Illinois, up 0.4 percent;
Pennsylvania, 0.5 percent; Michigan, 0.7 percent; and Ohio, 0.8
percent. Grain-growing Nebraska grew by a bare 0.9 percent.
Louisiana, hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the 1980s,
grew 0.8 percent.
   Five states lost population. The biggest percentage loser was
West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6 percent to
1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa, down 4.3
percent; Wyoming, down 2.9 percent; and North Dakota, down 1.7
percent. The District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5
percent.
   America's population grew at a slower pace in the 1980s than in
decades past: 10.2 percent, compared with 11.4 percent in the 1970s
and 13.4 percent in the 1960s.
   This year's population count, 249,632,692, for the first time
included some Americans living abroad. The 1980 population figure,
226,504,825, counted only people living within the nation's
borders.
   Wednesday's release was only the first burst of what will be a
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people
but their ages, races, housing situations, incomes and a wealth of
other data.
   The last figures in the $2.6 billion census won't be released
until 1993.
   All regions had more people in 1990 compared with 10 years
earlier. The Pacific, Mountain and South Atlantic regions had the
sharpest growth, and the East North Central, West North Central and
East South Central regions had the slowest.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. In the 1970s those regions had
each showed double-digit growth.
   By contrast, the East North Central states grew a bare 1.1
percent; the West North Central states, 3.1 percent; and the East
South Central states, 3.9 percent. Those numbers represented a
falloff from each region's growth in the 1970s.
   Other facts from the census release:
   -Besides California, states gaining representatives will be
Florida, four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina,
Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   -States losing representatives will be New York, three;
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, two each; and Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia, one each.
   -The 1990 census counted 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents
living abroad. Other Americans living overseas weren't counted.

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.

   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
   California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the
435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.
   The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.
grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director Barbara
Bryant said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by New York City and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the Commerce
Department must decide by July 15 whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the
1990 census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of
the House census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.
   Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," Mrs. Bryant said. In the
past decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,
while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and the
Midwest by 1.3%.
   The reassignment of seats in the House reflects these
trends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the Northeast and
Midwest. In addition to California, states adding seats
include Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gains
three seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia
and Washington, which each gain one seat.
   Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;
and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the District of
Columbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,
Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
Senate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia and Wyoming.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau figures released today indicate
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states
will lose at least one seat, forecasters say.
   The next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 Census
figures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.
The state population figures released today go up to mid-1989 and
represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in this latest report hold true through the final 1990
figures, California will gain seven seats, Texas and Florida each
will gain three, and Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona
will gain one apiece.
   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or more
seats, the Population Reference Bureau said. It said New York will
lose three seats, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois each
will lose two, and New Jersey, Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas, West
Virginia and Montana each will lose one.
   Comparable predictions by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed little. The
firm, however, added Kentucky to the list of losers, dropping one
congressional seat, and predicted that Florida will gain four
seats, rather than three.
   However, the Census Bureau figures on which the predictions are
based do not include members of the military and their dependents
living overseas. They will be counted in the 1990 reapportionment,
the government recently announced, and that change could mean the
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.
   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grew
at rates faster than 10 percent from 1985 to mid-1989.
   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase in
population between 1985 and mid-1989, Nevada, grew by 18 percent.
Second was Arizona, 12 percent, followed by Florida and New
Hampshire at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:
Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Louisiana and
Oklahoma.

   The populations of five states grew at rates
faster than 10 percent in the last half of the 1980s, the Census
Bureau said Thursday in a report that is causing revised estimates
for congressional reapportionment.
   The Census figures on state population, issued for release
Friday, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percent
from 1985 to the middle of 1989. Arizona had the second highest
growth rate, at 12 percent, followed by Florida and New Hampshire
at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau
said: Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   The population figures are closely watched at the end of each
decade because they determine how many seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives each state will have. The next reapportionment will
be based on the final 1990 Census figures, which will be collected
in the 10-year census next year.
   The report issued Thursday represents one last checkpoint before
that final, official count, and two forecasting groups on Thursday
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.
   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed on
the overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick up
seats lost by states in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in Thursday's report hold true through the final 1990
figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in Congress
while seven will gain.
   It said New York will lose three seats, Pennsylvania two, Ohio
two, Michigan two, Illinois two, New Jersey one, Massachusetts one,
Iowa one, Kansas one, West Virginia one and Montana one.
   The Population Reference Bureau said California will gain seven
seats, Texas will gain three, Florida three, Virginia one, North
Carolina one, Georgia one and Arizona one.
   The comparable prediction by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a few
states. It said Florida is likely to pick up four seats, rather
than three, and it added Kentucky to the list of those losing
seats, dropping one.
   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at this
point, be predicted with certainty. The Census Bureau figures on
which the projections are based do not include members of the
military and their dependents living overseas.
   The government recently announced that they will be counted in
the 1990 reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in some
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.

140,000 short of the figure the city submitted last fall in an official

preliminary numbers released in late summer, Weed said the city was not
satisfied with the final count, which could mean a loss of millions of federal
dollars.;    Census Bureau defends data;  Barbara Everitt Bryant, director of

cities in 18 states and the District of Columbia -- are part of the continuing
release of data from the 1990 census, which was conducted last spring. Figures

thousands of local jurisdictions had challenged the preliminary findings, it
was the big cities that were most critical of the 1990 census. Even before the
census was conducted, New York, Chicago, Houston and other communities filed a
suit to force the federal government to compensate for residents missed in the
head count by using a statistical formula to arrive at new population
figures.;    As a result of that suit, the government agreed to consider such
an adjustment, and a decision will be announced by July 15.;    In the
meantime, complaints from cities grew even louder Wednesday, when officials
saw that their population counts fell short of the figures they believe are
more accurate.;    Boston's complaint;  "It's embarrassing for the government
to put forward this as a final piece of work," said Allan Stern, a city
official in Boston responsible for the census.;    While city officials
believe Boston's population is more than 600,000, the Census Bureau published
a final count of 574,283, a gain of 20,571 over the preliminary number.;   
The statistics hold special significance in Massachusetts, which lost a
congressional seat in the 1990 reapportionment based on its population.;   
"We're losing a seat by 12,000 human beings," Stern said. "They're off by more
than twice that in this city alone.";    Atlanta sued;  In Atlanta, where city
officials filed a separate lawsuit in December challenging the census numbers,
the city's final figure prompted similar dismay.;    The Census Bureau's
figure for Atlanta was 394,017, a gain of 9,864 over the preliminary number.; 
  "The feeling is those figures are wrong," said Lyn May, a spokeswoman for
Mayor Maynard Jackson. She said the city would pursue its lawsuit.;    The
city believes its population is 437,000. "We stand by those numbers," May
said.;    This is the first time the Census Bureau has released detailed
population figures for the whole nation this early in the census reporting
process. Normally, population counts for localities are released one state at
a time over a period of many months.  </TEXT>

   The political outlook may have improved a bit
for the North in new Census population estimates.
   The South and West will wrest away some seats in the House of
Representatives after the 1990 national head count _ but maybe not
as many as had originally been thought.
   The Constitution requires seats in the House to be redistributed
among states after each census.
   The private Population Reference Bureau analyzed a complex
series of new Census estimates on Thursday, and predicted that 14
House seats will move from the Northeast and Midwest to the South
and West after the census.
   Earlier analyses by the same group had indicated as many as 18
seats would move.
   The Census estimates include four sets of possible state
populations for 1990, each differing slightly depending on the
amount of interstate movement by people.
   One set included no movement, and was discounted by the private
analysis group.
   But while reapportionment calculations based on the other three
varied slightly, the overall shift in seats was consistent.
   The big winner will be California, gaining six seats based on
the new figures. The previous calculations had called for
California to gain five seats.
   Texas and Florida will gain three seats each, the new estimates
indicate. Earlier calculations had shown Texas adding four seats
and Florida three.
   Arizona and Georgia, which had previously been expected to gain
two seats apiece, are now expected to add one, the new study said.
   Virginia also will gain one, as had been expected. North
Carolina would add one seat under two of the estimates, but would
remain unchanged under the third.
   On the losing side, New York is still expected to lose three
seats. Pennsylvania, which had been expected to drop three, now
appears likely to lose just two. Ohio, Illinois and Michigan will
drop two each, the same as previously expected.
   Also unchanged are losses of one seat each by West Virginia,
Iowa, Kansas and Massachusetts.
   Wisconsin, which had been expected to lose a seat, would not do
so under the new figures. And Montana would lose a seat under two
estimates but not under the third.
   Following the 1990 census, the Census Bureau will present the
White House with the final state population figures and the new
reapportionment numbers.

   The U.S. population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the 1990 census, the government said Wednesday in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   California, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a 26.1 percent increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
2.9 percent from 1980.
   Nevada was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and Florida and Arizona each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   West Virginia was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by 10.2 percent from the
226,504,825 people counted in the 1980 census, below the 11.4
percent population growth recorded from 1970 to 1980, and the 13.4
percent rate from 1960 to 1970.
   The information was contained in the Census Bureau's first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the 1990 count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give California
seven new House seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next summer.
   The cost of the 1990 census, from planning begun in 1984 to a
final release of data in 1993, is estimated at $2.6 billion by the
bureau.
   Still locked in Census Bureau computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of America near the turn
of the century.
   Besides Wyoming, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6
percent to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa,
down 4.3 percent, and and North Dakota, down 1.7 percent. The
District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5 percent.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was Nevada. That state's
population grew by 50.7 percent to 1,206,152. Besides California,
other states with gains of more than 25 percent were Florida, up
33.4 percent; Arizona, up 35.3 percent; and Alaska, up 37.4
percent.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. By contrast, the East North
Central states grew a bare 1.1 percent, and the West North Central
states, 3.1 percent.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. New England, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the 1980s, grew by 7.2
percent. The East South Central states grew only 3.9 percent.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 1991, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   California will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
House. Florida will gain four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia,
North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   New York will lose three seats; Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, two seats each; and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia,
one seat each.
   The 1990 census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the United States.
   The Census Bureau on Wednesday released two sets of 1980
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the 1990 national total was released in December 1980 but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The 1990 population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in 1790, the first census in the nation's history. By 1900,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In 1950, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In January, the Census Bureau will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by April 1.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

   In the politics of the future, California will
exercise more clout than any smoke-filled room of politicians ever
did.
   California emerges from the 1990 census as a political behemoth,
with 52 House seats, a population bigger than Canada's and 20
percent of the electoral votes needed to be elected president.
   Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and
they still will total fewer than the delegation from California,
which swells by seven in 1992, the result of a 26 percent surge in
population in the last 10 years.
   The news is nothing but promising for Republicans. California
hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964;
except for Jimmy Carter in 1976, no one has won the White House
while losing California since 1912, when Democrat Woodrow Wilson
lost the state but defeated Bull Mooser Theodore Roosevelt and
Republican William Howard Taft anyway.
   Republicans can find more cheer in most of the other shifts in
political power ordered up by the population figures released by
the Census Bureau on Wednesday.
   The industrial Northeast and Midwest will lose standing in
Congress and the electoral college. The West, the South and the Sun
Belt, increasingly Republican, gain.
   ``The political consequences advantage the Republicans,'' summed
up Stephen Hess, political analyst at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research organization.
   The census sets the stage, as well, for brutal redistricting
battles from coast to coast, promising to generate nasty
colleague-versus-colleague races in some of the 13 states where the
number of House seats must shrink.
   New York will suffer the biggest loss, three seats, and on the
streets of Brooklyn, that could come down to a brawl between two
Democratic incumbents, Reps. Charles Schumer and Stephen Solarz.
They may have to compete for a single seat.
   It is no coincidence, Hess observed, that Schumer and Solarz
have built up campaign warchests in the million-dollar range, each
anticipating a costly battle - or perhaps a race elsewhere, maybe
taking on Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato for his Senate seat.
   Four states lose two House members - Illinois, going to 20;
Michigan, to 16; Ohio, to 19; and Pennsylvania, to 21.
   Eight states will lose one each - Iowa, down to five; Kansas, to
four; Kentucky, to six; Louisiana, to seven; Massachusetts, to 10;
Montana, to one; New Jersey, to 13; and West Virginia, to three.
   Among the gainers are Florida, up four to 23, and Texas up three
to 30. And one additional seat in the House will go to five states
- Arizona, going to six; Georgia, to 11; North Carolina, to 12;
Virginia, to 11; and Washington, to nine.
   But it is California where the gains are most dramatic. In
January 1993, that state will have more representatives than 21
other states combined - Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Nevada, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia,
Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa and Mississippi.
   All states except the six which now have only one representative
- Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming
- will have to redraw congressional boundaries. The purpose is to
give each representative 572,466 constituents, or as close to that
figure as possible.
   The cry of gerrymandering - rigging election lines to favor one
party - is sure to be heard. In California, the election of
Republican Pete Wilson as governor will serve as a check if the
Democratic legislature tries to squeeze out Republicans, already
outnumbered 27-18.
   Elsewhere, black leaders in Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas have served notice that
they want the new lines drawn to create districts where blacks have
substantial majorities and a chance to elect a member of Congress.
   ``We will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that
there is a black congressional district in Virginia in 1991,'' Jack
Gravely, president of that state's NAACP, announced last fall.
   Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, disputed what he said was the
widespread view of the census figures as a ``windfall for the
Republicans.''
   Most states that picked up new seats did so because of growing
Hispanic populations, Gans said, and he predicted that Hispanics
will become increasingly loyal Democrats.
   ``Hispanics of the class that is expanding the population in
California, Florida, New Mexico and Arizona tend to vote 2-1
Democratic,'' he said. ``Eventually that's going to tell - probably
within the next decade.''
   Only in Florida, where Cuban-Americans favor conservative
candidates, can the Republicans anticipate long-term gains, he
said.

      Americans on the Move
   Are on the Rebound
   EVERY few years, Americans stuff their worldly goods into cardboard boxes and change homes. 
From the end of World War II until the 1970s, annually about 20% of the U.S. population changed residences. 

   During the 1970s and early 1980s, however, the "geographic mobility rate" drifted as low as 16%, the Census Bureau says. 
Bureau demographers believe that rising housing costs, especially high interest rates, made lots of people postpone moves, the bulk of which are local and tend to be more discretionary than long-distance ones. 

   Newly released figures show American mobility snapping back to more traditional levels, with 20.2% of the population moving in 1985, compared with 17.3% a year earlier. 
The Census Bureau, which has been charting household moves since 1948, finds the year-to-year increase of three percentage points "unprecedented," says Larry Long, of the bureau's Center for Demographic Studies. 
The mobility rise followed a sharp drop in mortgage rates from unusually high levels. 
Mr. Long speculates that many potential movers were simply waiting for housing to become more affordable. 

   Long-distance moves in 1984-85 marked the first time in several decades that the South didn't score a big population gain. 
Some 1.3 million people moved into Southern states, but nearly as many, 1.2 million, moved out, most to the Midwest and West. 
Census demographers say they aren't sure whether this shift in Southern net migration is a one-year statistical aberration or the start of a significant trend. 

   Shift to the Sun
   Belt For Congressional Seats
   POLITICIANS are starting to speculate how the population drift toward the Sun Belt during the 1980s will alter the balance of power in Congress. 
If state population trends continue as they have so far this decade, California would gain six seats in the House of Representatives in the 1990s. 
Two other Sun Belt states with prospective big gains in House seats are Texas, with four, and Florida, with three. 
Arizona, Georgia and Virginia each would add one seat. 

   The rejiggering of House membership comes in 1991, when states redraw congressional and legislative district lines based on the 1990 census. 
Since House membership is a permanent 435, states that saw an exodus of people in the 1980s will lose seats to states where population grew. 

   Election Data Services Inc., a political consulting firm in Washington, has figured the size of each state's delegation in Congress in the 1990s, using 1986 Census Bureau population totals. 
The big losers are in the Frost Belt: New York would drop three House seats, and Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania two each. 
Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Wisconsin would lose one seat apiece. 

   Ride-Sharing Incentives
   To Cut Los Angeles Smog
   MANY communities encourage voluntary car-pooling. 
In the smog-choked Los Angeles area, that encouragement is soon to be the law. 
By next Jan. 1, companies with more than 500 workers in a four-county area in and around Los Angeles must offer tangible rewards aimed at persuading employees who normally drive to work alone to join car pools or to ride buses or bicycles. 
Possible lures: cash bonuses, free gasoline, bus passes, choice parking spots in the company lot, and showers for bikers. 

   By 1990, the policy will cover companies with more than 100 workers in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties and the urban areas of San Bernardino County. 
That's roughly 8,000 employers with 1.5 million workers, or 40% of the area's commuters. 

   The ride-sharing rules, supported by most businesses as a cost-effective way to reduce both smog and rush-hour bottlenecks, are the strictest adopted so far in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The agency sees the plan as a potential model for communities elsewhere troubled with pollution or traffic congestion. 

   Enforcing the strategy is the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which was given expanded powers by the California legislature last year to deal with smog in the Los Angeles Basin, the nation's No. 1 air pollution problem. 
Companies have broad discretion in crafting incentives, but the air quality district will rule on each firm's plan and audit the firm for compliance. 

   Workers aren't required to accept the incentives, but companies are required to file a plan. 
"Our experience is that when incentives are offered, people reconsider their commuting options," says Thomas Eichhorn, the district's spokesman. 

   Helping Small Businesses
   Trade in Foreign Markets
   EXPORTING is standard fare for big manufacturers like Boeing or Caterpillar, but for a smaller outfit in, say, Columbus, Ohio, plunging into foreign trade with its letters of credit and exchange-rate exposure may be daunting. 
Finding a commercial bank to arrange and finance a trade deal of less than $1 million can also be tough. 

   The U.S. Export-Import Bank is trying to ease the pain with one-year pilot programs in three states -- Massachusetts, Maryland and California -- and three cities -- Columbus, Los Angeles, and Tucson, Ariz. 
The Ex-Im Bank provides a specialist to lead would-be exporters through the paperwork maze involved in loans to foreign buyers and working-capital guarantees. 
The states and cities support the project with money and professional services. 

   Says Raymond Lorello, Columbus's development director: "Our argument is that the $100,000 deal today may grow into the $1 million deal tomorrow."

<HEAD>Hispanic Population Booms, Census Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanics flooded into California, Florida and
Texas and accounted for about one-fourth of the nation's total
population growth in the first half of this decade, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Those states and New York each now have more than 1 million
Hispanics, the bureau said in its first detailed analysis of
minority populations since the 1980 census.
   Sixteen states, led by New York, had more than 1 million blacks
as of 1985, while California had the most Hispanics and other
minorities, the study found.
   Blacks comprise the nation's largest minority at 28.9 million,
the study reported. New York had the largest black population at 2.7
million, followed by California with 2.1 million blacks.
   But the black population of California was growing faster, adding
243,000 between 1980 and 1985, compared to a 219,000 increase for
the Empire State.
   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980
to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates
and international migration. Although they were only 6.3 percent of
the U.S. population in 1980, Hispanics made up about one-fourth of
the 12 million national population increase during the next
half-decade, the report said.
   California has the largest Hispanic population, the report
showed, at 5.9 million _ one-third of all Hispanics in the nation.
   Texas was second at 3.7 million followed by New York at 1.9
million and Florida with 1.1 million.
   California added 1.3 million Hispanics between 1980 and 1985,
while Texas gained 700,000. Florida, New York and Illinois also
added more than 100,000 Hispanics each.
   Among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growth
rate for that group, 16 percent, was posted by Florida.
   Mississippi had the largest proportion of blacks in its
population, 36 percent, the report found, followed by South
Carolina, 31 percent, and Louisiana, 30 percent.
   During the first half of this decade only West Virginia and the
District of Columbia had a decline in black population.
   More than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas,
the bureau found. And the shift continued to be in favor of cities
with blacks migrating out of rural southern regions and into urban
areas.
   The report added that four metropolitan areas have more than 1
million black residents _ New York (3.2 million), Chicago (1.6
million), Los Angeles (1.2 million) and Philadelphia (1.1 million).
   Almost 90 percent of all Hispanics live in metropolitan areas,
with more than half in seven metro areas, the study found _ Los
Angeles (3.6 million), New York (2.3 million), Miami (815,000), San
Francisco (775,000), Chicago (757,000), Houston (595,000) and San
Antonio (568,000).
   The nation also included 7.3 million other minorities, a category
that includes Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Eskimos
and Aleuts. This group jumped 1.9 million over five years, largely a
result of international migration.
   With 2.3 million, California was the leader in this category,
followed by Hawaii, 692,000, and New York, 516,000.
   Texas, Virginia and New Jersey had the fastest growing
populations in this group, however. Texas' other races increased 67
percent to 314,600 while the group was up 52 percent to 126,800 in
Virginia and 51 percent to 184,000 in New Jersey.

   Democrats bolstered their huge redistricting
advantage by adding two big prizes - Florida and Texas - to the
list of states where they hold a lock on redrawing political lines
for the next decade.
   Besides taking the governorships in those two states -
considered key because together they stand to gain seven U.S. House
seats - Democrats added Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico to
their remapping monopolies on Tuesday.
   Republicans won a crucial redistricting battle by taking the
California governor's race. The GOP needed it to keep a role in
drawing lines for the seven new House seats California is expected
to gain, because Democrats easily retained control of the
Legislature.
   The GOP also scored victories by winning the Ohio and Illinois
governorships, but Democrats clearly will have the national edge on
the process of reapportioning the 19 House seats that will change
hands due to population shifts of the 1980s.
   Advantages won Tuesday should help cement Democrats as the House
majority party for at least another decade. Democrats also said the
Florida and Texas wins would boost their 1992 presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said Paul Tully, political director
for the Democratic National Committee.
   ``These are not only net victories but victories in places that
because of their population growth will grow more important to the
future of this country and also to the presidential race,'' Tully
said.
   According to preliminary Census Bureau figures, eight states
will gain and 13 will lose seats when House districts are
reapportioned next year. Democrats will control the process
outright in at least five of the states gaining House seats.
   Despite the anti-incumbent mood thought to be sweeping the
country, voters appeared unwilling to turn out their state
legislators. Millions of dollars were spent on legislative races
this year due to their importance in the redistricting picture, but
few chambers changed hands.
   The GOP turned back Democratic efforts to take over the senates
of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Redistricting power will be
shared in all three states, which will lose House seats in 1992.
   ``This proves the Republican Party is alive and well despite the
doom and gloom predicted,'' said New York's state Senate Republican
leader, Ralph Marino.
   Democrats fended off Republican efforts to take over the state
senates in Illinois and Florida and the lower chamber in
Pennsylvania. The GOP was trying to wrest control of the Oregon
House from Democrats, too.
   Arizona's gubernatorial race was up for grabs, as the lead
seesawed throughout Election Night.
   Meanwhile, the GOP lost the Indiana House, but Republicans kept
control of the state Senate. Democrats captured control of the
state Senate in Arizona. A Democratic effort to gain control of the
Washington state Senate hinged on absentee ballots in two
neck-and-neck races.
   In Michigan, Republicans kept control of the state Senate.
   By losing in the governorships in Texas and Florida, the GOP
lost its say in how political maps will be drawn for those ne
House seats.
   Similar gubernatorial wins in Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New
Mexico gave Democrats absolute control there, too. The House
delegations in those states won't change, but Democrats can aim to
draw districts that protect their House incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers. The political lines for state seats are at
stake as well.
   Another victory for Democrats came in Kansas, where they ousted
a Republican governor and gained control of the state House. Kansas
will lose one House seat.
   Election Day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's
99 legislative chambers, and that margin was on track to change
little.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers were held by narrow
majorities.
   The Democrats were in position to draw districts that in 1992
could pad their House majority, now at 258-175 with two vacancies,
by a dozen seats or more beyoe Tuesday.
   The other five House seats are expected to go to Virginia, North
Carolina, Georgia, Washington and Arizona. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in Virginia and kept their sole control in
North Carolina and Georgia. A nonpartisnd the gains madan commission draws
the map
in Washington.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, New York will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be Massachusetts, New Jersey, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Iowa, Kansas and Montana.

      High-School Enrollment
   Has Its Ups and Downs
   WEST VIRGINIA might consider adding the high school student to its list of endangered species. 
A survey released this month of projected enrollments estimates that the state's high schools will graduate nearly a third fewer students by the year 2004. 

   High-school enrollment nationwide has been on a roller-coaster ride, giving school planners fits. 
The number of high-school graduates peaked in 1979, declined through the mid-1980s, and turned up slightly the past couple of years. 
Another major slump is expected in 1989 but will bottom out in the mid-1990s and then recover strongly just past the year 2000. 
The ups and downs reflect fluctuations in the U.S. birth rate and the influx of immigrant groups who favor large families. 

   The study by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, Boulder, Colo., and the College Board, New York, relies on population trends but doesn't try to forecast state economic conditions, which can cause sharp population swings. 

   The study says Nevada's high-school graduates will more than double by 2004. 
Graduates in California and Florida will increase by nearly two-thirds. 
Iowa, Illinois and Massachusetts face sharply fewer graduates.

   If You Can't Beat Them,
   Change the Rules
   CARBONDALE, ILL., news paper publisher W. Stephen Burgess says: "If you aren't in those books, you don't exist."
   He's speaking of the bibles of the advertising, media and sales industries -- such as Newspaper Rates and Data, and Survey of Buying Power -- that list income and demographic data for metropolitan areas. Because Carbondale doesn't meet the complex federal definition of a metro area, it isn't on these lists. And as a result, Mr. Burgess says, his newspaper, the Southern Illinoisan, has a tough time catching the attention of national advertisers.
   The solution? Become a metro area by act of Congress. At the behest of the city's boosters, Rep. Kenneth Gray (D., Ill.) introduced a bill naming the county that includes Carbondale and two adjacent counties as one Metropolitan Statistical Area. Though Carbondale has just 26,000 residents -- including 12,000 Southern Illinois University students -- the combined counties have more than 100,000 residents, one of the benchmarks of a metro area.
   Two other areas, Harvey County, Kan., and a two-county region including Decatur, Ala., have achieved the status by congressional fiat since 1986. The tinkering disturbs statisticians, though, who say it makes all metro area figures suspect.
   If the Carbondale bill is approved, it could be a shallow victory. Survey of Buying Power, a widely used sales and media guide, will stop listing metro areas that don't meet the government's traditional definition. "We're seeing statistics used in an improper way for private gain. It's a subtle form of pork barrel," says Edward Spar, vice president of Bill Communications, New York, the survey's publisher.
   Census Won't List
   Various Asian Groups
   CALIFORNIA congressman Robert Matsui appears to have lost a battle with the Census Bureau over how the nation's fast-growing Asian population will be counted.
   Rep. Matsui wants the 1990 census form's question on racial identity to contain a list of at least 11 Asian groups: Japanese, Korean, Hawaiian, Chinese and Samoan, for instance. Ethnic Asians would be asked to check one of the categories, or an additional line marked "other." A similar question was on the 1980 census.
   But the Census Bureau, citing space problems, has decided on a single fill-in-the-blank question, requiring Asians and Pacific Islanders to write in their ethnic identification. Paula Schneider, chief of the bureau's population division, says that in several field tests the write-in question resulted in more accurate data than the check-off method. Rep. Matsui, however, says many immigrants with poor English skills won't fill in the blank correctly.
   The Office of Management and Budget -- which has final say on census matters, barring congressional override -- is expected to side with the bureau.
   As a compromise, though, Ms. Schneider says the 1990 census will include far more detailed information on Asian groups than previous censuses, and the figures will be rushed out by the spring of 1991. After the 1980 census, it took until the mid-1980s before all the data on Asians were released.
   Odds and Ends
   SUN BELT inflation: Arizona's purchasing managers report that the rate of price increases last month was the state's second highest for any month in the past seven years. . . . So far this year, the Centers for Disease Control has identified 192 animal rabies cases in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia -- making it the region with the highest incidence of rabies in the U.S. . . . High-density bureaucrats: Alaska, New York, and Wyoming have more than 600 federal, state and local government employees per 10,000 population, the Census Bureau says.

<HEAD>With the House At Stake, Computers and Lawyers Are Ready for Redistricting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with batteries of computers and brigades
of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control
of the political shakeup that offers the GOP its once-in-a-decade
opportunity to dent Democratic control of Congress.
   ``If we want to be competitive in the House, we have to get a
good shake on redistricting,'' said Charles Black, the political
consultant who is chairman of the Republican National Committee's
advisory committee on redistricting.
   ``Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only
two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' he
said. ``One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redraw
the lines.''
   For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of their
depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the U.S.
House.
   Democrats control the House by a margin of 260 to 175. While
voters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republican
candidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more House
seats than they did when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981.
   Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comes
from voters' desire to have Congress act as a balance to GOP
presidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats'
drawing the lines for most current congressional districts.
   Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation's
congressional districts. It is a three-pronged battle _ technical,
political, and legal.
   Every 10 years, the U.S. Census counts everyone living in the
country. This time, the day for the count is April 1, 1990.
   For politicians, the most important Census information is not
how many Americans there are, but where they live. For while the
population increases, the size of the U.S. House remains at 435
voting members.
   By Dec. 31, 1990, the Census Bureau will announce each state's
population. And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the
U.S. House _ the number of representatives for each state, based on
a complicated mathematical formula.
   Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing the
boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population.
   Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched up
Census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their
friends and punish their enemies.
   They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies,
but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly
sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of
city blocks.
   But computers have little value to politicians who don't have
the votes to get their plan adopted.
   The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but the
Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans have
only 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamber
and Democrats the other. Nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisan
legislature.
   The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22
are Republicans.
   Elections this year and next will determine who controls
redistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the most
seats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles for
governor and legislative seats.
   The 1990 Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that will
have Congress speaking with a decidedly more Southern and Western
accent. Based on current estimates, 17 House seats will head South
and West.
   California will be the big winner, gaining six seats with an
outside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the current
House, California already has by far the largest congressional
delegation.
   Other winners are Florida, expected to gain four House seats,
and Texas, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each are
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
   The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrial
states that have seen their congressional representation erode in
recent decades.
   If current trends hold, New York will lose three seats and
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois two each. Losing one each
would be Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile races
for governor are in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois _ all
of which are now in GOP hands. But George Deukmejian of California
and Bill Clements of Texas are not running for re-election and Bob
Martinez of Florida is regarded as vulnerable. Jim Thompson of
Illinois hasn't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as
governor.
   In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countless
legislative contests.
   For example, in Michigan, Democrats would control the process if
they capture the state senate where Republicans have a narrow
majority. In Pennsylvania, Republicans control one chamber by four
seats and Democrats the other by three.
   After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle will
move to another arena, the courts.
   At some point in the 1980 process, redistricting plans in all
but three states ended up in court, says Kimball Brace, president
of Election Data Services, a consulting firm that works on
redistricting for Democrats.
   Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers
to defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal and
state courts.
   The guiding legal principle stems from the Supreme Court's ``one
man, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts be
substantially equal in population.
   Brace cited a Michigan plan that ended up in court. Republicans
offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population
by no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of the
Democrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical in
population.
   How long do districts remain identical in population? Probably
not more than a day or two after the Census is taken.

   Florida has supplanted Pennsylvania as the fourth most-populous state, ranking behind California, New York and Texas, the Census Bureau said. 

   The Commerce Department bureau put the overall estimated U.S. population as of July 1 at 243.4 million people, up from nearly 241.1 million in mid-1986 and 226.5 million in the 1980 census. 

   The latest estimates showed that Florida's population has grown by 2.3 million people, or 23%, since 1980 when it ranked seventh. 

   Pennsylvania now ranks fifth, followed in order by Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and North Carolina, the Census Bureau said. 

   Meanwhile, Alaska, the least-populous state at the time of the 1980 census, is now second-smallest with an estimated population of 525,000. 
Wyoming ranks last with a population of 490,000. 

   Population losses continued in the past year in five farm states -- Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho. 

   Energy-depressed states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming, also showed losses, and Texas grew far more slowly than earlier in the decade, the agency said. 

   The new figures are only estimates. 
The government will conduct a fullfledged census in 1990.

   Democrats on Tuesday padded their overwhelming
control of political redistricting, plucking the potent Florida and
Texas governorships from GOP hands and adding Rhode Island,
Oklahoma and New Mexico to their remapping monopolies.
   The Florida and Texas defeats were disastrous for Republicans,
and Democrats were in the running for the only remaining major GOP
redistricting weapon - the California governorship.
   Democrats clearly will have a huge edge when lines are drawn for
1992 congressional races, all but cementing the Republicans as the
House minority for another decade and perhaps far longer. And
Democrats were calling the Texas and Florida victories a boost for
their 1992 presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said Democratic National Committee
political director Paul Tully. ``These are not only net victories
but victories in places that because of their population growth
will grow more important to the future of this country and also to
the presidential race.''
   In all, eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when House
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts of the
1980s, according to preliminary census data. Democrats will control
the process outright in at least five of the states gaining House
seats.
   The Ohio governorship was the only significant redistricting
victory for Republicans as results from gubernatorial and
legislative races trickled in. So frustrating was the GOP's night
that the only redistricting monopoly the GOP gained was in Vermont
- which has only one House seat anyway.
   Despite the millions spent on oft-ignored state races with the
post-Census redistricting in mind, it appeared but a few of the
dozen targeted chambers would change hands.
   The GOP turned back Democratic efforts to take over the New
York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Senates. Redistricting power in all
three states, which will lose House seats in 1992, will be shared.
   Republicans failed in their bid to wrest the Illinois Senate
from Democrats but won a close governor's race to keep a say in
redistricting there. The GOP was trailing in bids to win over the
Democratic Florida Senate and Pennsylvania House. Early returns
showed control of the Oregon House within reach.
   The Indiana House was likely to go from GOP hands to the
Democrats. Other Democratic targets were the state senates in
Indiana, Michigan and Washington and both chambers in Arizona.
   The GOP suffered a big loss when Democrat Lawton Chiles unseated
Florida's Republican governor, and things would only get worse.
   The Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico governor's offices
went from Republican to Democratic hands and then Texas was seized
by the Democrats too.
   Democrats now will have sole power over the remapping in those
states. Florida is likely to gain four House seats and Texas three.
The House delegations in Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico
won't change, but control of redistricting should allow Democrats
to draw districts that protect their House incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers.
   Another victory for Democrats came in Kansas, where by unseating
a Republican governor the party went from being shut out of the
process to having veto power in redistricting. Kansas will lose one
House seat.
   The Republicans' last hope was California, which will get seven
of the 19 shifting seats. But even with a win in the governor's
race there the GOP would only share the power with the Democratic
legislature.
   Democrats, with huge majorities in many legislative chambers,
were virtually assured a redistricting voice in all the
battleground states even before the polls opened Tuesday.
   The day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's 99
legislative chambers and 29 of the 50 governorships.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers are held by narrow majorities.
   Even with California undecided, the Democrats were in position
to draw districts that in 1992 likely would pad their majority in
the House, now at 258-175, by a dozen seats or more beyond whatever
gains they made in Tuesday's elections.
   Preliminary census data suggest the remaining five House seats
that shift will go to Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Washington
and Arizona. Among those states, redistricting control was a
serious question only in Arizona. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in Virginia and kept hold of their sole
control in North Carolina and Georgia. A nonpartisan commission
draws the map in Washington.
   Democrats were facing uphill odds in their effort to erase the
Arizona GOP's 17-13 Senate and 34-26 House majorities. But Democrat
Terry Goddard was leading in early returns in the governor's race .
If elected, he could veto any redistricting plan drawn by a
possibly Republican legislature.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, New York will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was headed to easy re-election and the New York
Assembly had a 92-58 Democratic majority entering Tuesday's voting.
Results were slow to come in, but Democrats conceded they would not
capture the Senate, where they had hoped to wipe out a five-seat
Republican majority and gain a redistricting monopoly.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be Massachusetts, New Jersey, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Democrats control
the process in New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana.
In Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas and Montana the power will be
shared.

   Racial Groups Diverge
   In Timing of First Births

<TEXT>
   RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are
widening, two University of Pennsylvania demographers find.
   Drawing on birth and other records published since 1979,
Renbao Chen and S. Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to
1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earlier
trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women
over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births
than over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to
catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,
Asians and others -- also tended to have their first children
at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.
   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other
nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth
than were white women of the same age. For example, in 1987 a
20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have
her first child in the following year as was a 20-year-old
white woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 1
1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her
white counterpart.
   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have far
lower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,
blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and other
involuntary factors. This situation started reversing in the
1950s, and the difference has grown greater as more white
women have forgone having children altogether. In 1987, for
instance, a white woman born in 1954 was better than three
times more likely to be childless than a 33-year-old
nonwhite.
                                                                                                       

   Farm Belt Holds Onto
   Its Oldest Americans
                                                                                                       

   THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the Farm
Belt, 1990 census figures show.
   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men and
women are found in the most populous states: New York,
California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
Michigan. In each of these, people 85 and over total well
into six figures.
   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,
however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the
85-and-older group accounts for 1.5% or more of the total
population. Iowa leads with 2.0%, closely followed by South
Dakota and Nebraska with 1.9%, North Dakota with 1.8% and
Kansas with 1.7%.
   In nine other states, including Arkansas, Missouri,
Minnesota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, the oldest old account for
1.6% or 1.5% of the total. The other states in this category
are East Coast: Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and
Maine. Alaska, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,
with only 0.2% of its population 85 or older.
   Much the same states rank at or near the top in the
percentage of total state population living in nursing homes.
The Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Montana and Rhode Island are the only states with
at least 1% of their populations living in nursing homes.
Census Bureau specialist Cynthia Taeuber says most nursing
home residents are 85 or older.
   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in these
states? Ms. Taeuber hypothesizes that in most of these states
younger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,
while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitably
constituting a larger share of the total. And with their
children moved away, many end up in nursing homes.
   Another census report says that the number of
centenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubled
between 1980 and 1990, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated
14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in 1980.) More
than 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 of
the total were white.
                                                                                                       

   Golf Has More Players,
   Who Play More Often
                                                                                                       

   MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing more
often, a recreation specialist reports.
   Rod Warnick, a University of Massachusetts professor who
tracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adult
golfers increased about 6% a year in the 1980s to 22.2
million, while the number of days played grew about 7%
annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of
"heavy" golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, grew
even faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while the
number of days these avid golfers played increased about 8%
annually to almost 300 million days.
   Mr. Warnick says the growth of leisure time, the
increasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the baby
boomers all contributed. He also finds that more women and
minorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as apt
to lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golf
clubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given to
equal treatment.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOBILE HOMES make up 7% of the nation's housing inventory,
the Census Bureau reports. This is the fastest-growing type
of housing, up 60% since 1980. . . . Athletes who play hard
to win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play for
fun, University of Florida researchers find. They say those
who take a game too much to heart are more likely to put
themselves in a risky situation in an effort to come out
ahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women
65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under a contract with the
government's National Institute on Aging. About two-thirds of
all disabled older people are female.

   Population Drain Ends 

   For Midwestern States 

   IOWA IS MAKING a comeback. 
So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. 
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s. 

   The gains, to be sure, are rather small. 
Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the Census Bureau says. 
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since 1981. 

   Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin. 

   The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race. 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s. 
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 

   At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround. 
Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska. 

   Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue. 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing. 

   More Elderly Maintain 

   Their Independence 

   THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. 
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. 
A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970. 

   This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. 
That share has remained at about 24% since 1970. 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. 
In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970. 

   As people get even older, many become widowed. 
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to 40% in 1988 from 38% in 1970. 

   Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. 
Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970. 

   The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%. 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially. 

   Careers Count Most 

   For the Well-to-Do 

   MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family. 

   At least that's what a survey by Ernst &amp; Young and Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman indicates. 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group. 

   Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. 
Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000. 

   The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class. 
Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 

   Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive. 

   Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it. 
Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off. 

   Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. 
About 40% don't feel they're more able than others. 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only 25% give $2,500 or more to charity each year. 

   Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, 60% feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978. 
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from 33% in 1978. 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%. . . . 
Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 in 1987. 
Per capita personal income ranged from $11,116 in Mississippi to $23,059 in Connecticut. . . . 
There are 13.1 million students in college this fall, up 2% from 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates. 
About 54% are women, and 44% are part-time students.

POPULATION BOOM BOOSTS SAN DIEGO AREA TO NO. 17 IN NATION, CENSUS BUREAU SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The San Diego metropolitan area has added more than half-a-million residents in 
the 1980s, representing one of the fastest growth rates nationwide, the Census 
Bureau reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom has vaulted the city past Pittsburgh and Baltimore in the 
last year, making San Diego the 17th largest metropolitan area in the country, 
according to the Census Bureau's annual estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the population of San Diego and its suburbs rose 509,000 (27.3%) since 
the start of the decade, including an increase of 84,100 residents from 1987 to 
1988. Among large metropolitan areas, only Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta grew 
faster, with the Phoenix population increasing by 34.5% since 1980, the most in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Greater Chamber of Commerce official welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a confirmation that San Diego is a rapidly growing area," said Max 
Schetter, the chamber's research director. "People are coming here because of 
the jobs and the things to do here, the opportunity, the strong economy." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's population has been growing at 4% annually, contrasted with 2% for 
California and 1% for the United States, Schetter said. Last year's increase, 
the highest since 1950, was likely the largest ever in peacetime, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Schetter also cautioned that the boom is unlikely to continue because of 
inadequate road and sewer networks, and high housing prices. "I would be 
surprised if (growth) stayed at that rate much longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The annual survey examined 283 metropolitan areas, each an urban region with 
its own local economy, according to Census Bureau spokeswoman Cheryl Chambers. 
But Schetter complained that the Census Bureau's count stopped at the 
international border, excluding Tijuana and its estimated 1.5 million residents 
from the San Diego metropolitan area.

<HEAD>States Consider Laws Requiring Companies to Insure Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poor-Insurance, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of some of the states considering legislation to
help workers who have no health insurance. Hawaii and Massachusetts
have laws requiring employers to insure their workers.
   _Alaska: A bill in the Senate would provide up to 10,000
uninsured people with state-subsidized health insurance. Lawmakers
also are considering a mandatory insurance bill based on
Massachusetts' law.
   _California: Five bills have been introduced, including one
requiring companies with five or more employees to provide health
care benefits. About 2.7 million workers are uninsured, or about
one out of 10 California residents.
   _Delaware: A measure pending in a Senate committee is aimed at
providing insurance for the indigent. Between 80,000 and 90,000
people are uninsured.
   _Florida: Legislators are considering a measure based on
Massachusetts' law, requiring employers to insure their employees.
An estimated 1 million to 2 million people, or one-sixth of
Florida's population, are uninsured.
   _Georgia: The General Assembly passed a measure creating a
high-risk health insurance pool that will arrange health insurance
for those who could not previously qualify for insurance. About 2
million people are uninsured.
   _Illinois: A bill would require businesses with five or more
employees to provide health benefits for employees who work more
than 17{ hours weekly. About 1.5 million Illinoisans have neither
private health insurance nor Medicaid, or more than 13 percent of
the state's 11 million people.
   _Indiana: The state General Assembly is considering a measure
that would create a commission to study the need for
state-sponsored health care services. Indiana has 769,000 people,
or about 17 percent of the population, with no insurance.
   _Iowa: A bill passed by a House committee creates a $200,000
study, eventually calling for businesses with 40 or more employees
to provide insurance coverage. About 350,000 people, or more than
10 percent of the state's population, are uninsured.
   _Kansas: A bill in the appropriations committee seeks to
establish an insurance ``buy-in'' program for workers who meet
poverty guidelines and whose employers do not provide coverage.
About 480,000 Kansans, or 14 percent of the state's population, are
uninsured.
   _Minnesota: Bills pending in the House and Senate aim to
guarantee that all Minnesotans have access to affordable health
insurance. About 400,000 people, or 9.3 percent of the state's
population, are uninsured.
   _New York: A pilot program will provide health insurance to
14,500 uninsured New Yorkers, mostly those unemployed or employees
of small companies. About 2.5 million people are uninsured, and 75
percent of them are working.
   _Ohio: A House bill would require insurance coverage for
low-paid workers with a 1 percent payroll tax on employers. About
1.4 million of Ohio's 11 million residents are uninsured.
   _Oklahoma: A bill seeks to provide `insurance of last resort''
to workers without health insurance. An estimated 636,800 people
are uninsured out of a population of 3.3 million.
   _Oregon: The Senate approved a bill that would revamp the
federal-state Medicaid program with the aim of covering more poor
people. About 400,000 people are uninsured, about 15 percent of
Oregon's population of 2.7 million.
   _South Carolina: Lawmakers are considering a measure that
creates an accident and health insurance pool to help uninsured
workers. About 440,000 of South Carolina's 3.1 million people are
working without insurance and are ineligible for Medicaid.
   _Vermont: Lawmakers are considering a plan to help small
companies provide health insurance to their workers. About 31,000
of Vermont's 550,000 residents are uninsured.
   _Virginia: The General Assembly passed a $14.8 million program
to provide medical care for those with little or no health
insurance. About 880,000 of Virginia's 5.9 million residents have
little or no insurance.
   _Washington: The state's five-year Basic Health pilot project
provides health care to the ``working poor'' who are not covered by
welfare programs. About 720,000 people, or 16 percent of
Washington's residents, are uninsured.

   Simply put, the question was who should be
counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not. But there's
nothing simple about it.
   The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme
Court to decide whether it was right or wrong.
   That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional
reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and
politically charged.
   The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was
whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will
reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census. There
could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five
states to Sun Belt states with large numbers of illegal residents.
   Nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing
to do, given the fact that they don't want to be spotted by the
government. Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not
including them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population
count, would be even more difficult. ``A census of only legal
residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all
residents,'' according to Census Bureau testimony to Congress.
   After the 1980 census, the government estimated that there were
2.57 million people in the United States illegally. There were other
guesses, some of them far higher. The government made no attempt to
count them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two
previous administrations decided that the Constitution required that
the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.
   There is not likely to be any change in that prior to the 1990
census next spring. The Senate has passed an immigration bill
including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the
redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before
the next year's national head count.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration
bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the
redistricting process. It would give Secretary of Commerce Robert
Mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that
illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing House
seats. It does not come with instructions, so the department would
have to figure out how.
   Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to ``make such
adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using
such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and
appropriate'' to keep illegal aliens from being counted in
congressional reapportionment.
   That task would be perilous politically, since it would involve
taking House seats away from some states and giving them to others,
all on the basis of estimates. With 435 seats in the House, every
representative gained by a state is a representative lost by another.
   Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable. ``The
framers of the Constitution intended to count all persons,'' Kennedy
said.
   The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the House is to
be determined on the basis of ``the whole number of free persons,''
excluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.
That was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment
of House seats will be based on ``the whole number of persons in
each state.''
   Neither the original article nor the amendment mentions
citizenship in connection with apportionment, although the term
``citizens'' is used in some other provisions. Opponents of the
amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted
everybody counted for purposes of apportionment.
   But Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said the people who wrote the
documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren't any
in their time.
   That came later, with immigration restrictions that began in 1875.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the question
should be put squarely to the Supreme Court. He said it is unfair to
count illegal aliens in reapportionment. ``It just does not make any
sense,'' Dole said. ``It does violate the constitutional principle
of one man, one vote.''
   But opponents of the Shelby measure said apportionment doesn't
involve who votes and who doesn't. Women couldn't vote when the
Constitution and the 14th Amendment were adopted, but they always
were counted. Children can't vote, but they count, too.
   The amendment was adopted after the Senate voted 58 to 41 against
a move to reject it, and 56 to 43 against scuttling it as
unconstitutional.
   Shelby said that is sure to put the matter into the hands of the
courts for a final judgment. ``Somebody is going to challenge it
...'' he said. ``Then, for the first time, we will let the Supreme
Court of the United States decide something that we need an answer
to ...''

<HEAD>Eleven States Get Preliminary Population Reports</HEAD>

   Hawaii and Nevada have topped the 1-million
population mark, according to the Census Bureau, which is issuing
preliminary 1990 counts for 11 states.
   While 10 of the states showed population gains in data released
Friday, Ohio recorded a decline from the 1980 national head count.
   The bureau said that it had counted 10,777,514 people in Ohio,
down from 10,798,000 in 1980.
   Officials stressed that the reports are preliminary. They are
designed to give local officials a chance to raise questions if
they find areas where they believe people have been missed or
overcounted.
   The final, official, census counts are scheduled for release on
Dec. 31.
   Friday's report brings to 40 the number of states for which
preliminary counts have been published. The rest are expected in
the next week or two.
   Newly released state counts, and the census count in 1980 are:
   _Alaska, 545,774, up from 402,000.
   _Arizona, 3,619,064, up from 2,718,000.
   _Colorado, 3,272,460, up from 2,890,000.
   _Hawaii, 1,095,237, up from 965,000.
   _Kansas, 2,467,845, up from 2,364,000.
   _Maryland, 4,732,934, up from 4,217,000.
   _Nevada, 1,193,287, up from 800,000.
   _North Carolina, 6,552,927, up from 5,882,000.
   _Ohio, 10,777,514, down from 10,798,000.
   _Virginia, 6,127,680, up from 5,347,000.
   _Washington, 4,826,675, up from 4,132,000.

SENATE VOTES TO BAR COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS

In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in 
the 1990 population count. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush Administration 
and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable. Just 
before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against killing the 
proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has 
said that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, 
Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
millions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," Dole 
argued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost 
House seats after the 1980 Census, and California and New York -- centers of 
illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the Census Bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
Michael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that House 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the Senate's decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman James Gorman. "If Congress passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

<HEAD>Northeast Slipping to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The densely settled Northeast has become the
nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the
first time, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   The bureau also projected that Texas will surpass New York for
second place behind California in population by 1995.
   And between now and the year 2000, half of all U.S. population
growth will occur in just three states: California, Texas and
Florida, the report said.
   The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births,
deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau
demographer Signe Wetrogen explained.
   The Northeast has been declining in its share of the U.S.
population, with less growth than other areas, Wetrogen said in a
telephone interview. ``It is the one region with the highest share
of population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.''
   Population shifts to the South and West in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, ``so the
(Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's left
without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area than
other parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed,
however. New Jersey leads the nation with more than 1,000 people
per square mile.
   Between 1987 and 1988, the Western region increased from 49.6
million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time,
the population of the Northeast edged upward from 50.1 million to
50.3 million, to slip into last place.
   The 1988 estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the Midwest with 59.6 million.
   Historical records show that, while it was the center of early
American development, the Northeast hasn't actually been the most
populous region since 1820, when the South edged ahead. It remained
second until 1880, falling to third behind both the Midwest and
South.
   By 1990, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the Midwest, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million;
and Northeast, 50.6 million.
   By 2000, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for the
South, 59.6 million for the Midwest, 59.4 million for the West and
51.8 million for the Northeast.
   By 2010, the report added, the West could replace the Midwest as
the second-most-populous region.
   State population projections showed California remaining
unchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million people
today to 29.1 million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000.
   Texas is expected to surpass New York for second rank by 1995.
The Empire State now leads Texas 17.7 million to 17.2 million, but
by 1995 Texas is projected to have just over 19 million people,
with New York at only 17.9 million.
   Florida is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, although
by the year 2010 it may be closing in on New York as well, the
Census Bureau said.
   By the year 2000, Illinois will have replaced Pennsylvania in
fifth place and Georgia will move into 10th, displacing North
Carolina, the report said.
   The U.S. population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in
1987 to 267.7 million in 2000.
   In that period, California is expected to add 6 million
residents, Florida 3.5 million and Texas 3.3 million. That means
those states would have growth of 12.8 million people, 52 percent
of the national increase of 24.4 million.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia were projected to lose population this decade.
   Population losses in the 1990s were predicted for nine more
states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota,
Nebraska, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming. On the other hand, growth
was predicted to resume in the District of Columbia.
   During the 1990s, the maturing of the post-World War II Baby
Boom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 age
group in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to
44 is expected to drop in the Northeast and Midwest but grow
elsewhere, the report said.
   The study said the South continues to have the largest
percentage of blacks in its population, 16 percent. More than half
of all black Americans reside in the South, and that is expected to
continue.

<HEAD>Military Personnel Overseas Will Be Counted in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American military personnel stationed overseas
will be counted in the 1990 census, but the House on Tuesday
blocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens.
   The decision to include military personnel in the count was
announced by the Commerce Department at the start of a hearing on a
bill to require the action.
   According to Tuesday's announcement, the Census Bureau will work
with the Pentagon to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military
and civilian Defense Department workers overseas.
   At the same time the sometimes emotional debate over leaving out
undocumented aliens was under way both in committee and on the
House floor, where Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., failed in an effort to
attach the ban to an appropriations measure.
   His amendment was offered to a $5.8 billion appropriation bill
for running the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments next year,
including $800 million for carrying out the 1990 census. The bill
was approved by a vote of 258 to 165, and sent to the Senate.
   The dispute cuts close to home for the 435 House members, since
the Census count will be used to redistribute House seats among the
states. States which have grown in population will get more seats,
others will lose them.
   Many Northern states, already facing losses because of
population shifts to the South and West, fear additional gains by
the Sun Belt states and large urban centers because of the
settlement of illegal aliens in those areas.
   Hence, Ridge's amendment, rejected after extensive parliamentary
maneuvering.
   Opponents pointed out that the Constitution specifically
requires House seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons''
residing in a state.
   ``Every Census since the Constitution was created has counted
all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''
observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the
Census, responded Ridge.
   The count, scheduled for April 1, 1990, will cost $4 billion,
said Ridge, asserting that the Census Bureau has the money to
identify and separate out illegal aliens, but doesn't want to.
   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., contended that at the time the
Constitution was written there were no illegal aliens, all new
arrivals were welcome.
   Rep. Marvyn Dymally, D-Calif., countered that there have always
been undocumenmted aliens in this country. The difference is that
in the early days they came from Europe.
   The debate, Dymally said, is really over the fact that
population shifts will lead House seats to Southern and Western
states and that undocumented aliens are being blamed.
   ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down
to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a
seat,'' said Dymally.
   Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., however, said he cannot understand
why illegal aliens should be allowed to dilute the representation
of U.S. citizens.
   Counting illegal aliens ``is not fair. It may be Constitutional,
but it's just not right,'' said Valentine.
   ``The question is how are we going to identify those that are
here illegally that are not entitled to representation in this
body,'' said Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan. ``That will be tough to do
... the least we should so is to make that extraordinary effort.''
   ``You're now asking the Bureau of the Census to be judge and
jury in determining who should be counted,'' responded Rep. Robert
Garcia, D-N.Y.
   The questions of counting undocumented aliens and overseas
military personnal have been tied together in many debates, with
the question raised of the fairness of including illegal aliens but
not American servicemen and servicewomen in the figures used for
apportionment.
   In the past, service members overseas generally have not been
included in census counts used to apportion seats in the House of
Representatives.
   That is because census officials considered it impossible to
determine accurately in which state an individual should be
counted. Many military people move often.
   The Census Bureau said it will investigate ways to make that
judgment in the 1990 census. Possibilities include listing a
service person's last state of residence for more than six months,
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.
   Census officials have generally opposed any attempt to delete
illegal aliens, contending that they have no method of determining
who is in the country legally. Asking people about their status
would likely result in people lying or refusing to participate in
the count, officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of
residents in many areas.

   From the great cities to the small towns,
America's municipalities are telling the federal government they
can't possibly be as small as census takers say.
   By the thousands, local officials are demanding something be
done about the 1990 Census. Even states are contesting the
preliminary figures, aware that the more residents they are
credited with, the more federal aid they will get and the greater
their representation in Congress will be.
   Some voices from the nationwide chorus:
   -``Unadulterated nonsense ... statistical grand larceny,'' said
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
   -``There are errors everywhere,'' said Detroit research director
Juliette Okotie-Eboh.
   -``It really stretches credibility to the breaking point,'' said
Hartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry.
   -``They missed our farthest south street,'' said Hays, Iowa,
City Clerk Judy Grothe.
   All were reacting to the preliminary results of the Census
Bureau's April 15 head count.
   The preliminary reports were sent out in late August and early
this month to give officials a chance to file challenges in time
for the bureau to double-check its numbers before announcing its
final count Dec. 31.
   Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant has already told Congress
there will be big changes in the initial numbers.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' she said.
   Even some states that posted gains in the preliminary figures
are upset.
   Take Texas. Despite recording significantly more people, state
officials say the count is not high enough.
   ``Our conservative estimate puts the state's population at about
17 million. If the census' final count ... stays with 16.8 million,
Texas will definitely be shortchanged,'' state Comptroller Bob
Bullock said.
   But it is clearly from the jurisdictions that showed losses that
the loudest complaints are coming.
   Such as West Virginia, credited with the largest population drop
of any state.
   ``Many West Virginians live up dirt roads and hollows, and
proving their existence has been as difficult as it has been for
the Census Bureau to find them,'' said Bob Brunner, spokesman for
Gov. Gaston Caperton.
   Or Pennsylvania, where Vincent Carocci, spokesman for
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey, said the preliminary count
underestimated the population by 200,000 to 300,000. Census takers
undercounted the state's cities, Carocci said, because people there
are ``just harder to count.''
   Or tiny Jacksonburg, Ohio, which the Census Bureau said has 14
residents. Last week, 39 Jacksonburg residents appeared at a
protest of the count. Between them, they said they could count at
least 26 more people in the town.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena was ``stunned.'' New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo exclaimed, ``I don't believe it.'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson said if errors aren't corrected, ``we'll see them in
court.''
   Barraged with such complaints, the Census Bureau is having
workers do rechecks of some neighborhoods, add late reports and
factor in military personnel overseas.
   The bureau has its hands full.
   In Iowa, officials say as many as 75,000 residents were missed.
   In Louisiana, said a representative of Avoyelles Parish, ``We
know for sure that's not right. Several types of errors were made
but I don't know what kind. ``Something went wrong, but I guarantee
that we will get to the bottom of this.''
   Why are the numbers so important?
   Simple. After the nation's population is counted every 10 years,
the House of Representatives is reapportioned and federal and state
aid formulas are adjusted. Losing people, or not growing as fast as
other places, can mean a loss of political power and federal aid
until the next census.
   The census news wasn't bad everywhere, though.
   Seattle and Washington state officials are pleased with the
preliminary counts, which exceeded their own estimates.
   ``We still think there are people out there that the census did
not count, but generally we think they did a pretty good job,''
said urban research analyst Eric Friedli.
   ``My impression is that we have a smaller proportion of people
who aren't going to respond or who aren't going to be counted. I
don't see any outstanding reason to say this is a bad census,''
said Lawrence Weisser, a state research investigator.
   Officials in Sacramento, Calif., are puzzled by preliminary
census figures 5 percent higher than they had estimated. ``I'm at a
loss,'' said Scott Mende, a city planner.

   Seven of the 10 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. are in Florida, a new Census Bureau report shows. 

   The population of the Naples, Fla., area grew faster than that of any other metropolitan area between 1980 and 1987, surging 48.8% to 127,900. 

   All of the 61 metropolitan areas that grew at a pace twice as fast as the nation as a whole are in the South or West. 
The population of the entire country grew 7.4% between 1980 and 1987. 

   Other Florida metropolitan areas on the Census Bureau's top 10 list are Ocala, Fort Myers-Cape Coral, Fort Pierce, the Cape Canaveral area, West Palm Beach and Orlando. 
All but Orlando are largely resort or retirement communities, the Census Bureau said. 

   Metropolitan areas outside Florida making the top 10 list are Austin, Texas, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, and Las Cruces, N.M. 

   The government defines a metropolitan area as "a population nucleus" of at least 50,000, usually a city, plus its immediate suburbs and adjacent communities "having a high degree of economic and social integration." 
The Census Bureau now identifies 282 such areas. 

   Among big cities, the fastest-growing metropolitan areas are Phoenix, up 29.8% in the period, and Dallas-Fort Worth, up 27.1%. 

   Of the 54 areas that lost population between 1980 and 1987, 41 were in the Northeast and Midwest. 
The biggest percentage decline in population was in Duluth, Minn., where the Census Bureau estimates the population fell 9.4%.

   Most Americans will pay attention to the 1990 Census for about half an hour -- just long enough to fill out the form. 
But Members of Congress from both parties, aware that Census results affect billions of dollars in federal aid and the distribution of House seats, have been trying to second-guess the Census Bureau and influence the outcome. 
Forcing such tinkering on the bureau will compromise the nation's head count. 

   Rep. Thomas Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, wants to stop counting illegal aliens for the purposes of reapportioning House seats. 
Otherwise, House seats would be transferred to states with large illegal populations. 
Last week, a House committee attached his proposal to a bill by Democratic Rep. Mervyn Dymally that would force the Census Bureau to compensate for any undercount of minorities. 
Rep. Dymally, who opposes the Petri measure, then cast the deciding vote to kill his own bill. 

   But efforts to tug the Census Bureau this way or that aren't over. 
Rep. Petri intends to reintroduce his proposal next year, and New York City is preparing to sue the Census Bureau to force its count to include the estimated three million people it will miss nationwide. 
Adoption of either proposal would make an accurate head count more difficult and inject politics into one of the few government agencies that does its job without constant micromanagement by Congress. 

   Rep. Petri says the Census Bureau counted two million illegal aliens in 1980, and the total next time could top five million. 
States with few illegal aliens, such as Pennsylvania, will lose House seats to such states as California if illegal aliens are counted. 
Rep. Petri says some citizens would thus be denied an equal voice in Congress, adding that it is "repugnant" to allocate House seats on the basis of people "who would be deported if the laws were being enforced." 

   Actually, we think the immigration laws Rep. Petri speaks of are more repugnant than anything the Census Bureau could cook up. 
In any event, the Constitution clearly states that all "free persons" are to be counted for reapportionment purposes, and most courts have held that the Framers were well aware of the semantic distinction between "person" and "citizen." 

   Rep. Dymally agrees efforts to exclude aliens are impractical, but he says the Census Bureau must account for the estimated 1.4% of the population -- including many urban blacks -- that they missed in 1980. 
Rep. Dymally claims not adjusting for this undercount will deny minorities adequate representation and their share of federal dollars. 
He doesn't mention it could also send his liberal colleagues from declining population areas into retirement. 

   Mr. Dymally says adjusting for an undercount is feasible, but the Commerce Department decided last year not to change procedures, saying that whichever one of 24 competing methodologies it adopted would be statistically suspect. 
No doubt the Census will again miss some people, but attempting to quantify that total will only introduce more mistakes into the process. 
The party in power would always be tempted to answer such complaints by using a new method that aided it politically. 

   The Census Bureau plans to work with the NAACP and other groups to achieve the most immediate, practical solution -- encouraging minorities and others to participate in the Census. 
That is more likely to ensure an accurate count than turning the U.S. census into a constant game of political number-shopping.

   WASHINGTON -- The populations of many big industrial
states stagnated in the 1980s, while Americans swarmed to the
Sun Belt and the West Coast, according to preliminary U.S.
Census Bureau figures.
   The population of New York state barely grew over the past
decade, rising a mere 0.4%, to 17,626,586 from 17,558,000.
Over the past year, it actually declined. The populations of
Illinois and Pennsylvania also slipped slightly between 1980
and 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the population of California surged nearly 24% in the
1980s, to 29,279,015 in 1990 from 23,668,000 in 1980. Texas
grew 18%, to 16,824,665 from 14,229,000 in 1980, although its
population slipped over the past year, according to the
figures.
   The figures on New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Illinois
were released yesterday, completing the Census Bureau's
preliminary population listings for all 50 states.
   California easily retained its spot as the most populous
state, while New York managed to hang onto the No. 2
position.
   A Census Bureau official cautioned that the counts are
incomplete and likely will be changed in the final report,
which is expected next spring.

   The Census has counted 91 percent of American
households, the bureau reported today.
   The national head count is now entering the home stretch, said
bureau director Barbara Bryant.
   Census takers are still going door-to-door seeking those people
who have not yet been counted.
   The effort is expected to continue at least through the end of
June and mop-up activities are likely to continue through August.
   The first official report on the nation's population is due Dec.
31.
   The census is mandated by the Constitution every 10 years. The
numbers are used to reapportion seats in Congress and to distribute
billions of dollars in federal money.

Dividend From Tax Returns:
Details on Migration Patterns
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
05/05/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
GOVMT
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
   THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE isn't the only federal agency peeking at your income-tax records. 
Sometime this fall, the IRS will hand over to the Census Bureau a massive computer file containing personal and basic income information for everyone who filed a tax return for 1986. 

   This sensitive transfer of tax records has been taking place annually since the early 1970s, when the aim was to determine how to divide billions of dollars of federal revenue-sharing money among communities. 

   But revenue sharing is dead. 
These days, the tax records are mostly used to trace movement of the American public from place to place. 
The migration figures, purged of names and income, can be purchased from the IRS. 
A bank in a high-growth area, for example, could use the figures to see precisely where its potential new customers are arriving from. 

   THE MIGRATION PROJECT is statistically awesome. 
Using your Social Security number, the Census Bureau will compare the address that you printed on your 1986 tax return with the address on your previous year's tax form. 
The idea is to see if you changed residence between tax filings and, if so, from where to where. 

   A similar address scan is done on every other individual tax return. 
Matching the estimated 103 million returns filed for 1986 with the roughly 99 million from 1985, adding the number of exemptions claimed, and charting where everybody moved down to the county level is no small data-processing chore. 
The project will tie up the bureau's huge Univac 1100/84 computer for some 700 hours, a computer run roughly equivalent to the first tally of the entire 1990 national census. 

   When the address information is combined with the number of exemptions claimed by the tax filer, the IRS data yield the single best picture of population migration available during the 10 years between national head counts. 

   This sort of intelligence is solid gold to market researchers, developers and planners who are forever seeking better ways of predicting and charting state or regional population growth. 
Migration data is vital in the local growth equation because what sets the growth rate of one area apart from another is almost entirely the movement of people. 
Birth and death rates, the other main population components, are relatively constant throughout the nation. 

   DEMOGRAPHERS USE voter registrations, auto registrations, school enrollments, and other social indicators to figure out whether a state is gaining or losing population through migration. 
What the IRS figures show in addition to this are the origins and destinations of these migrants. 

   The IRS numbers, for example, illuminate the strong population flow between Colorado and California and show how that stream has reversed in the last decade. 
At the end of the 1970s, some 5,000 more people were moving to Colorado from California each year than were leaving Colorado for California. 

   Over the next few years, Colorado's attraction for Californians gradually diminished, and by 1983 the migrant flow between the two states was about equal. 
The most recent IRS figures show that the flow has tilted steeply toward California with net in-migration of 5,400 Coloradans in the year ended April 15, 1985. 

   Arizona pulled a net 4,400 residents from Colorado in the latest reporting year. 
The states with the biggest net population losses to Colorado: Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming. 

   New Jersey massaged the IRS data and found that it is pulling in people from heavily populated Northern states such as Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Indiana, while losing residents, on balance, to increasingly urbanized states in the South and West, such as Florida, California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia. 

   ARMED WITH this knowledge, a New Jersey demographer assumes that most of those leaving for Florida are retirees, while most of the Illinois newcomers are in the active labor market. 
The makeup of these two migrant streams has very different implications for the state's future population. 

   The IRS data isn't a perfect migration mirror. 
Because it only catches tax filers, migrants below the income-filing threshold don't show up on the Census Bureau printouts. 
The 1986 tax law, which eliminates still more people from the tax rolls, will make the movement of low-income Americans, many of them elderly, even harder to trace. 

   The Census Bureau's migration methodology also assumes that all the exemptions listed on a tax form change residence when the tax filer does. 
That isn't always so, as in the case of divorced couples where one parent has custody of the children, and the other has financial support. 
A single person who marries, moves and the next year files a joint return, is also lost in this tabulation. 

   Addresses can be a problem for the Census Bureau, especially at the local level. 
Taxpayers sometimes list post-office-box numbers on their return from a different jurisdiction than their home. 

   Affluent taxpayers sometimes file from the offices of their lawyers or accountants. 
The world knows that President Reagan has been in residence in Washington, D.C., since 1981. 
But on their Form 1040 filed two weeks ago, President and Mrs. Reagan gave their address as 333 South Grand in Los Angeles. 
That's the office address of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the Reagans' attorneys. 

   When it comes to migration, the Census Bureau's computer thinks the First Family lives in California.

   Census Bureau
   Says It Missed
   2% of Population

   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 census missed more individuals --
both proportionately and in absolute numbers -- than in 1980,
undercounting the U.S. population by 2%, according to
preliminary findings by the Census Bureau.
   The new estimates could have far-reaching effects on
congressional redistricting and the allocation of federal
dollars to state and local governments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings are based on two Census Bureau projects: a
post-enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the
1990 census and a demographic analysis of state, local and
federal administrative records.
   The census count for 1990 is 248,709,873 nationwide.
According to the post-enumeration figures, however, the
census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and
254,989,000.
   Under a 1989 court order in a lawsuit brought by New York
City and several other cities, the Bush administration must
decide by mid-July whether to adjust the 1990 count based on
the post-enumeration survey. The decision will be made after
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher reviews recommendations
by the Census Bureau and several independent experts
concerning the post-enumeration data.
   The post-enumeration findings "continue to strengthen the
case that failure to adjust will cause substantial damage in
many, many places across the country," said Rep. Tom Sawyer
(D., Ohio), who heads the House census and population
subcommittee.
   But Census officials were quick to warn that the
post-enumeration data could reflect errors in the
post-enumeration survey itself rather than in the census
count. "We know we have the symptoms of an undercount," said
C. Louis Kincannon, bureau deputy director. But he stressed
the need to make sure that the "cure is not worse than the
ailment."
   If the population count is adjusted, California and other
Western states probably will gain the greatest benefits,
along with the District of Columbia and the rest of the
South-Atlantic region, according to the post-enumeration
estimates. In both regions, the census undercount was found
to be proportionally greater than it was for the entire U.S.
   The regions that will benefit the least from an adjustment
include New England, the Mid-Atlantic area and the Midwest.
No state figures are likely to be adjusted downward, but
population counts for certain cities and counties in states
such as Pennsylvania and Ohio might be lowered, according to
bureau assistant director Peter Bounpane.
   Despite doubts about the post-enumeration data, it isn't
likely the bureau's demographic analysis data will change
significantly, Mr. Bounpane said. According to the analysis,
the 1990 census missed 1.8% of the population, compared with
1.3% in 1980.
   The undercount appears to be particularly sharp for
blacks. According to the bureau's demographic analysis, the
census failed to count 7.2% of the black population, compared
with 4.7% in 1980. A bureau official said the black
population is harder to count than the population at large,
possibly because a high proportion of blacks are low-income.
A black majority in the District of Columbia may explain why
the census apparently missed a huge fraction of people living
in the bureau's back yard: According to the post-enumeration
survey, roughly 4% to 8% of all Washington, D.C., residents
were uncounted.

   The countries five largest cities retained
their rankings in the Census Bureau's latest estimates of city
populations but San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth
largest city.
   The Census Bureau said that San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville,
Fla., also moved up in the rankings of the country's 25 largest
cities in a new report prepared for release today.
   New York City ranked No. 1 in population in 1988 followed by Los
Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, the same positions
these cities held in 1986, the last time the bureau estimated city
populations.
   But San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth largest
city while San Jose passed San Francisco and Indianapolis to move
into 12th place. In the other change in the top 25, Jacksonville
replaced Washington, D.C., as the 16th largest city.
   Since 1970, there have been major shifts in the ranking of the
most populous cities, with many in the East and Midwest being
replaced by cities in the South and West. Seven of the 10 largest
cities in 1970 were in the North and East but by 1988 there were
only four in these regions. Baltimore, Washington and Cleveland had
been replaced by San Diego, San Antonio and Phoenix.
   Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lost
population from 1986 to 1988, including Houston, Dallas and Denver.
Dallas' population loss dropped the city under 1 million, a level
Dallas had reached for the first time in 1986.
   The bureau's new estimates were prepared using procedures that
rely on measuring components of population change since 1986 such
as statistics on births and deaths and monitoring of federal income
tax returns to make estimates of net migration into an area.
   The bureau's population estimates cover inside the city limits
and do not include suburbs. Populations and rankings for
metropolitan areas, including suburbs, can differ substantially
from those for cities.
   Following are the 1988 Census population estimates for the
country's 25 largest cities, with each figure followed by the 1986
estimate. The figures are in thousands:
   New York: 7,353; 7,263
   Los Angeles: 3,353; 3,259
   Chicago: 2,978; 3,010

<HEAD>Census Reaches 99 Percent of Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau is closing in on the last 1
percent of American households that haven't yet been tallied.
   The 1990 count has reached 99 percent of all homes, officials
proclaimed Sunday, despite a disappointing start in April.
   The door-to-door counting will continue at least through autumn
in areas where the work is not complete, officials have said.
   In many regions a ``were you counted'' campaign is starting in
an effort to reach people who have been overlooked so far.
   ``Without the willingness of hundreds of thousands of Americans
who volunteered and stuck with a tough job, we would not be where
we are now,'' Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said in a
statement.
   With more than 100 million households across the nation, the 99
percent mark means that 1 million homes remain to be counted.
   Officials hope the new campaign will reach many of them through
posters in stores and community centers, newspaper advertising and
similar efforts. People will be encouraged to call or write the
census bureau so they can be counted.
   The results of the census, taken every 10 years, are used to
reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and to distribute
billions of dollars in federal money over the next decade.
   With such high political and financial stakes, the effort has
attracted close attention. Minority groups are concerned about
being undercounted and cities have claimed that many of their
people are missed, especially in hard to count inner-city areas.
   A group of large cities led by New York has sued in an effort to
get the final totals adjusted to account for this assumed
undercount.
   Census forms were mailed out to most Americans in March, but
only 63 percent were returned because of delivery problems and
apparent public confusion. Thus the door-to-door effort starting in
April had to be increased, likely adding several million dollars to
the $2.5 billion-plus cost.
   Officials said more than 80 million of the completed census
forms have been processed at census offices. In the 1980 census
that processing didn't begin until August.
   The bureau is required to report the population of each state to
President Bush by Dec. 31, and Census Director Barbara Everitt
Bryant said she is confident that deadline will be met.
   Nationwide, the Census Bureau said 100 percent of households
have been counted in 27 states, while work remains to be done in 23
states and the District of Columbia.
   Those with the count still incomplete are:
   Arizona, 97.5 percent; California, 94.4 percent; Colorado, 99.7
percent; Connecticut, 96.3 percent; District of Columbia, 88.7
percent; Delaware, 94.3 percent; Georgia, 99.1 percent; Maryland,
94.4 percent.
   Also, Massachusetts, 97.4 percent; Michigan, 99.4 percent; New
Jersey, 98.9 percent; New Mexico, 98.9 percent; New York, 89
percent; North Carolina, 98.3 percent; North Dakota, 99.5 percent.
   And Ohio, 99.8 percent; Pennsylvania, 98.1 percent; Rhode
Island, 99.2 percent; South Carolina, 95.1 percent; South Dakota,
99.5 percent; Tennessee, 99 percent; Utah, 99.7 percent; Virginia,
99.6 percent; Wyoming, 99.7 percent.
   Major cities where the bureau says it has counted all the
households are Austin, Texas; Chicago; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio;
Dallas; El Paso; Fort Worth; Houston; Indianapolis; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Kansas City; Milwaukee; Minneapolis-St. Paul; New Orleans;
Oklahoma City; San Antonio, Texas, and Seattle.
   Cities where the bureau said the count is still incomplete
include Atlanta, 97.3 percent; Baltimore, 97 percent; Boston, 90.9
percent; Denver, 99.2 percent; Detroit, 98 percent; Los Angeles,
95.6 percent; Memphis, 96.4 percent; Nashville, 99.9 percent; New
York, 83 percent; Philadelphia, 95.1 percent; Phoenix, 95 percent;
San Diego, 99.9 percent; San Francisco, 90.7 percent; San Jose,
Calif., 84.5 percent.

   SAVAGE, Md. -- The volunteer fire company's ladies'
auxiliary still holds its all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinners
for $5. The Methodist church still puts on its ham-and-oyster
feast. The regulars still linger over coffee at Ma's Kettle,
just as they've done for years.
   But this old mill town has changed in the past decade.
There are two new schools. Across the railroad bridge, a
tract-housing development has transformed fields into a
forest of roofs, with a horizon full of chimneys and
skylights. There are new streets with names like Thamesmeade
Road. And Jan Arnold, Savage's only mail carrier, no longer
can deliver the whole town's mail by 10 a.m. These days she
isn't done until 5:30 p.m.

land separating the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore
metropolitan areas. With the entire 35-mile stretch between
the two center cities likely to be deemed urban, business
leaders in both cities are pressing the White House Office of
Management and Budget to declare Washington and Baltimore one
huge metropolitan area -- what is technically called a
"combined metropolitan statistical area," or CMSA.
   Such a decision would instantly create the nation's
fourth-largest market and, its backers hope, a marketing
bonanza. Other areas have found that consolidating
metropolitan areas for marketing purposes can have a huge
benefit.
   In Massachusetts, Lawrence and Salem, two medium-sized
cities north of Boston, now are marketed as part of the
Boston/Lawrence/Salem area, making them part of the nation's
10th-biggest market. Together, Dallas and Fort Worth
constitute the seventh-biggest market. And now that Buffalo
and Niagara Falls constitute one market, development
officials in Buffalo can tout their area as a tourism mecca.
   Over the years, such designations have had big impact on
such diverse activities as cellular-phone marketing,
transportation programs and federal spending. A decade ago,
after the last census, Republican Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas
slipped a 25-word amendment through Congress to include rural
Harvey County in the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area,
permitting the county's three hospitals to be eligible for
Medicare reimbursement under an advantageous urban formula
rather than under a less-generous one used for rural areas.
   A budget-office decision on the Washington-Baltimore areas
has historic implications. "If Washington and Baltimore do
combine, it will be the largest such consolidation in world
history," says Richard Forrestal, chief of the
population-distribution branch of the Census Bureau. "There
is no other case where urban areas of this size have grown
together to the point where they could be considered a single
metropolitan area."
   Backers of the consolidation expect that the new
population numbers that are now beginning to trickle out of
the Census Bureau will only prove what residents of the two
cities -- and those here in Savage, in the middle -- already
know: Suburban sprawl and commuting patterns have blurred the
lines between the Baltimore and Washington areas. And now
they are hoping for a federal ruling acknowledging that the
two metropolitan areas -- covering 6,948 square miles in 17
counties and traversed by 22,000 miles of public roads -- are
one.
   A budget-office ruling favoring the combination would have
implications that would reach into every one of the estimated
2.4 million households in the region. "It would help -- a lot
-- in efforts to attract international firms and capital,"
says William Wrench, a Northern Virginia developer who is
president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. "It's
pretty simple: It's a lot easier to sell the fourth-biggest
market." (Washington is now the sixth-biggest market in the
country and Baltimore is the 16th.)
   Local business leaders believe they would be able to lure
more development and retail activity to the area and forge
new trade links abroad. "Fireworks aren't going to go off
when this happens and the rivers are still going to flow in
the same direction," says Robert Grow, deputy director of the
Washington-Baltimore Regional Association. "But we'll have a
big marketing advantage."
   Many of these same business leaders lobbied the budget
office a decade ago, only to find that the two metropolitan
regions didn't meet the bureaucrats' standards. But they are
confident that this time will be different. Indeed, a single
square mile area of Savage that a decade ago was home to
fewer than 300 souls now holds 10 times that many -- far more
than the 1,000 per square mile that the Census Bureau uses to
define an urban area.
   The census statistics underline important changes that are
transforming the region. "It used to be that you knew
everyone in town," says Agnes Riley, a lifelong Savage
resident who is the bookkeeper and secretary at a local
real-estate company. "Now you don't."
   The spillover from Baltimore and Washington, combined with
workers from Fort Meade, a nearby Johns Hopkins University
laboratory and a National Security Agency installation, have
given the town a different look. The Bowling Brook Farms
development is full of young women going to aerobics classes
in pink sweat suits and couples that shoo their children up
the pressure-treated wood steps, onto the deck and into the
door at dusk.
   "This was a very small blue-collar town," says Bobby Ray
Mitchell, who as a boy went to class in the old red-brick
schoolhouse up the road. "People's fathers and grandfathers
worked in the mill together. Today the town is full of new
people. We even have the yuppie crowd."
   But even if Savage, the missing urban link, has gone
metro, the notion of one Baltimore-Washington area seems
jarring to many people. One city is famous for its sausage
and crab cakes, the other for its quorum calls and conference
committees. One dotes on its steamed mussels, the other
worships political muscle.
   "You only have to get in your car and drive around to see
that these areas are integrated," says Paul Groves, a
geographer at the University of Maryland. "But they are not
unified. The two center cities have different characters and
are in different political jurisdictions. And much of the
area between the two cities is not densely populated at all."
   Some Washingtonians fear the budget-office decision could
derail the city's effort to win its own major-league baseball
team. If the two cities are part of one metropolitan area,
they say, baseball's paladins could argue that Washington
already has a team: the Baltimore Orioles.

   Though the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers, Congress is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant? 

   The Census Bureau, as it has in the past, is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status. 
But the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. 
A majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support. 

   "It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced," Rep. Thomas Petri (R., Wis.) said in a recent House debate. 

   Replied Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): "A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present." 

   Although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography. 
Wisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. 

   "It boils down to regional politics," says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. 

   Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau. 
The Census Bureau's chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk. 
On the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit. 

   "Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans," says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. 

   The Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California. 
That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. 

   "You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House. 

   Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign. 
They fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks. 

   "As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential," Mr. Vargas says. 
"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder." 

   The Census Bureau agrees. 
"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form. 
We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants}," says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director. 
"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation." 

   Although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if Congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, Mr. Bonpanne says. 
The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. 
To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. 

   Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems. 
"We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be," he complains. 
"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . . not to gather demographic information." 

   The Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment. 

   Because California, Texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the House, the House has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants. 
The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from "knowingly" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds. 

   All sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what Congress does. 
In 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants. 
A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed. 

   The Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the "the whole number of persons" in each state. 
The Constitution originally called for counting "free persons" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. 
That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. 
Only "Indians not taxed" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940. 

   Much of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word "person" in references to the census. 
Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word "citizen." 
They wrote, for instance, that only those who have been "seven years a citizen of the United States" can serve in the House. 
The word "person" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War. 

   Those in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate. 
Their opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an "illegal immigrant," let alone contemplated their current numbers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partisan makeup of the House for the next
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year. A
they choose governors and state legislators, these voters will be
picking the powerbrokers for major redistricting battles.
   The arcane redistricting process draws little attention from
voters. But national political parties are pouring millions of
dollars and advice into state legislative races that often are
ignored in Washington except in years ending in zero.
   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the Census Bureau
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute U.S. House seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 House seats are expected to shift as a result of the
1990 Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
Northeast and Midwest to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the White House from
the GOP.
   Republicans for most of the 1980s touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the House. But the GOP now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the GOP is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said Tim Dickson, executive director
of the Democratic Party's redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the House through the
year 2003; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said Ben Ginsberg, the Republican National
Committee's chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the 1980 Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the Census Bureau term
for deciding how many of the 435 House seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in Virginia, New Jersey,
Mississippi and Kentucky.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
California, Florida and Texas.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
Florida Senate appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the Texas and California
legislatures and in the Florida House.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the Florida Senate, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, New York, focuses on the state Senate, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the RNC's Ginsberg.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said Democratic
National Committee redistricting guru Mark Bohannon. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President Bush has visited New York to help the GOP's state
Senate effort, and Gov. Mario Cuomo is working hard for the
Democrats. New York likely will lose three of its 34 House seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Michigan.
They hope to capture the senates in Pennsylvania and Michigan and
both chambers in Indiana, where the GOP has two-seat majorities in
the House and Senate. With the Ohio gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the Ohio Senate, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim GOP majorities in both chambers of the
Arizona legislature and the Colorado House.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the Florida Senate
contests as well as in Illinois, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the Senate. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in Pennsylvania and Oregon, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are Massachusetts, New Jersey, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas and Montana. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by California, which should
gain seven seats and see its House delegation grow to 52. Florida's
expected gain of four would bring its House delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by Texas would swell its
representation in the House to 30.
   Together, these states would supply 24 percent of House members
and hold 105 Electoral College votes - 38 percent of the 270 needed
to win the White House.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Washington.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - Idaho,
Kansas, New Hampshire and South Dakota - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

SENATE VOTES TO PROHIBIT COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS

<P>
In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in 
the 1990 population count. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned," said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A. Pulido. Pulido and 
other Santa Ana council members say that the 1980 census substantially 
under-counted its population at 215,000. The city has been lobbying hard to 
have its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the 
1990 count. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush 
Administration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and 
unworkable. Just before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against 
killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Urge Veto 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has 
said that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, 
Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
millions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have said California could lose up to $300 million in federal 
aid if illegal aliens were uncounted. Santa Ana has estimated its potential 
loss at $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pulido and county advocates for poor Latino residents expressed 
concern that the decision would promote fear and intimidation in the community. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal 
aliens in Orange County was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind Los 
Angeles County in California, a county official said. There are no current 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified 
through the amnesty process for legal residency," Pulido said. "Those 
individuals, when asked or challenged about their status, can be legitimately 
concerned. I think the census's attempt to question them could be misconstrued 
as an attempt by the immigration service to get information." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Acosta said he "was saddened" by the Senate's action because 
the city was determined "to count every single person, and I know that (now) 
we're going to to suffer from this monetarily." 
</P>
<P>
But Pulido said he believes the House of Representatives will not allow the 
prohibition to survive, especially since it killed an earlier, similar effort. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," Dole 
argued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost 
House seats after the 1980 Census, and that California and New York -- centers 
of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action would also have an impact on smaller California cities 
without substantial Latino populations because census population figures play 
an important role in Community Development Block Grant formulas, said Don 
Vestal, Westminster city planner. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is following a recommendation by the Census Bureau to form a 
Complete Count Committee of officials and community leaders to help ensure 
cooperation from all city residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's in our best interest to get as complete a count as we can," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development Block Grant formula, among other things, Vestal said, 
includes use of income figures and percentage of lower income residents in the 
city. "In addition to just counting heads, they're getting economic information 
of the city that will affect us in the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria McDonough, director of Abrazar Center, an elderly-assistance center for 
Latinos in Westminster, said the senators' action shows they have no 
understanding of the impact of illegal immigration to California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you count them or not, the undocumented residents are still going to 
impact federal dollars in our community. And whether we like it or not they're 
here and here to stay," McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, representatives from the census office in Santa Ana have 
visited such social centers as Abrazar and others and told center staff people 
that they intend to count "everyone, regardless of where they came from," 
McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their big thing was, 'We do not care about the origins of where these people 
are from, but, more importantly, their impact to local economies,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment, census officials in Santa Ana referred media inquiries 
to the regional office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Dove, assistant regional director for the U.S. Census in charge of 
outreach, said that despite the Senate's decision, the census bureau "really 
doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
"But we have a mandate to follow that law, and we would have to find out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the Census Bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
Michael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that House 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the Senate's decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman James Gorman. "If Congress passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the Census Bureau
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute U.S. House seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 House seats are expected to shift as a result of the
1990 Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
Northeast and Midwest to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the White House from
the GOP.
   Republicans for most of the 1980s touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the House. But the GOP now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the GOP is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said Tim Dickson, executive director
of the Democratic Party's redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the House through the
year 2003; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said Ben Ginsberg, the Republican National
Committee's chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the 1980 Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the Census Bureau term
for deciding how many of the 435 House seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in Virginia, New Jersey,
Mississippi and Kentucky.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
California, Florida and Texas.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
Florida Senate appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the Texas and California
legislatures and in the Florida House.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the Florida Senate, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, New York, focuses on the state Senate, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the RNC's Ginsberg.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said Democratic
National Committee redistricting guru Mark Bohannon. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President Bush has visited New York to help the GOP's state
Senate effort, and Gov. Mario Cuomo is working hard for the
Democrats. New York likely will lose three of its 34 House seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Michigan.
They hope to capture the senates in Pennsylvania and Michigan and
both chambers in Indiana, where the GOP has two-seat majorities in
the House and Senate. With the Ohio gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the Ohio Senate, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim GOP majorities in both chambers of the
Arizona legislature and the Colorado House.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the Florida Senate
contests as well as in Illinois, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the Senate. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in Pennsylvania and Oregon, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are Massachusetts, New Jersey, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas and Montana. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by California, which should
gain seven seats and see its House delegation grow to 52. Florida's
expected gain of four would bring its House delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by Texas would swell its
representation in the House to 30.
   Together, these states would supply 24 percent of House members
and hold 105 Electoral College votes - 38 percent of the 270 needed
to win the White House.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Washington.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - Idaho,
Kansas, New Hampshire and South Dakota - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

   Americans elect a new president and vice president this year
along with a dozen state governors, 33 U.S. senators and all 435
members of the next U.S. House of Representatives.
   Election Day is Nov. 8. The Census Bureau estimated the nation's
voting-age population _ people aged 18 or over _ will be 182.6
million, about 8.1 million more than in 1984 when 92,654,861
actually voted for president.
   This year's election is for the four-year presidential and vice
presidential terms starting next Jan. 20, when Republican Ronald W.
Reagan will retire after eight years in the White House.
   Here's the 1988 election situation for top federal and state
offices:

   Vying for votes in the 50 states and the District of Columbia
are:
   _Republicans George Bush for president and Dan Quayle for vice
president. Bush, vice president under Reagan, and Quayle, a U.S.

Convention in New Orleans. The last incumbent vice president to be
elected president was Martin Van Buren, a Democrat, who won in 1836.
   _Democrats Michael Dukakis for president and Lloyd Bentsen for
vice president. Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, and Bentsen, a
U.S. senator from Texas, were nominated at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. The last sitting governor to be elected
president was Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York in 1932.
   Among various other presidential candidates on the ballots are
the New Alliance Party's Lenora B. Fulani of New York, a
psychologist, joined in most states by the Libertarian Party's
Ronald E. Paul, a former congressman from Texas, and in some states
by the Consumer Party's Eugene J. McCarthy, a former U.S. senator
from Minnesota.

<HEAD>U.S. House</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives for the 101st
Congress is being elected this year. Members will serve during the
first half of the new president's administration.
   Under the Constitution, every state is entitled to one House
seat; beyond that, representatives are apportioned among the states
according to population, with figures determined on the basis of
every 10-year census.
   The term of office is two years, starting Jan. 3, 1989.
   To hold a majority, one party must win at least 218 seats.
Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress.
   Present occupants of the House's 435 seats include 255 Democrats
and 177 Republicans, with three seats vacant.
   Here are the vacancies, and those who had held the seats: New
Jersey's 3rd District, Democrat James J. Howard, who died March 25;
Tennessee's 2nd District, Republican John J. Duncan, who died June
21; and New York's 19th District, Democrat Mario Biaggi, who
resigned Aug. 5.
   Representatives must be elected; House vacancies cannot be
filled by appointment.
   In all, 27 House seats are open _ three are vacant, one
incumbent lost in a primary, 12 representatives are retiring at the
end of this term, seven congressmen are nominees for Senate seats,
three gave up their House seats and unsuccessfully sought
nomination for the Senate, and one congressman is a gubernatorial
nominee.
   The remaining 408 representatives campaigned for re-election.

<HEAD>The Electoral College</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Because the nation uses an Electoral College system, voters
don't directly elect the president and vice president. Instead,
Americans cast ballots for electors, apportioned among the states
and the District of Columbia.
   In this election, 538 electoral votes will be at stake in 50
states and the District of Columbia, with at least 270 electoral
votes needed to win. Electors will meet in the states and District
of Columbia on Dec. 17. Their votes will be counted Jan. 6 by a
joint session of Congress.
   Reagan won the 1984 presidential election with 54.45 million
popular votes and 525 electoral votes, beating Democrat Walter F.
Mondale who received 37.57 million popular votes and 13 electoral
votes. Reagan carried 49 states in 1984 while Mondale carried
Minnesota and the District of Columbia.
   Here's the distribution of electoral votes at stake this year:
   _47 for California.
   _36 for New York.
   _29 for Texas.
   _25 for Pennsylvania.
   _24 for Illinois.
   _23 for Ohio.

<HEAD>Dinkins Says Census Bureau Missed 1 Million New Yorkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins has accused the Census
Bureau of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up
to 1 million residents in its preliminary 1990 count of the city's
population.
   Dinkins said Wednesday the city is filing a challenge to the
government's figures. Federal aid and representation in Congress
are determined by the Census count.
   ``The 1990 undercount could cost us up to $1 billion in lost
federal aid, or $150 for each man, woman and child living in our
city,'' he said. Dinkins also said the count could cost the city at
least one seat in Congress.
   The mayor said the Census Bureau failed to count 254,534 housing
units, undercounting the city's population by 800,000 to 1 million.
   The Bureau counted 7.033 million people in the city. The
Department of City Planning estimates 8 million people live in the
city.
   ``It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for
the Census Bureau to claim that a city whose resident birth rate
has risen by at least 23 percent and which has welcomed more than
800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has
actually lost population,'' the mayor said.
   The city was given 15 business days to review the Bureau's 1990
preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, Con
Edison and the New York Telephone Co., as well as consulting
surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.
   In his letter to Sheila Grimm, regional director of the Census
Bureau, Dinkins asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city
blocks - approximately 43 percent of the city's more than 28,000
residential blocks.
   The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's
challenge.
   In a three-block area in one section of Queens, the city counted
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one-and
two-family homes; the Census Bureau counted zero units.
   Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to
be undercounted by the bureau, said Richard Schaffer, director of
the Department of City Planning and chairman of the City Planning
Commission.
   Dinkins said the 1980 undercount, put by the Census Bureau at
450,000, cost New York City some $675 million in federal aid during
the ensuing 10 years.
