   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was listed
in serious condition this morning, recovering from a near drowning
in her backyard pool, and a doctor says she could be out of the
hospital within a week.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' said Dr. James Little, a neurologist.
``She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue
to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will
regain full mental functions.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded Sunday afternoon from
critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve Sunday
night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, gave the thumbs-up sign Sunday to her intensive
care unit nurse and was able to talk.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a pulmonary specialist.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said Sunday. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan, who gained national attention during the 1974
Watergate impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter
to Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Ms. Jordan's live-in companion, Nancy Earl, called paramedics,
who restored her pulse and breathing.
   Deaton said she came ``within four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   ``She does not know what happened and was clearly concerned
about it and had indicated that she didn't think she would go
swimming alone again,'' Deaton said.
   Ms. Jordan was breathing Saturday night only with the help of a
ventilator, but Sunday the device was gone and she was responding
to questions and talking, doctors said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate,
telephoned a message for Ms. Jordan, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn
Hinckley Boyle said. Ms. Jordan made a seconding speech for
Bentsen's nomination at the recent Democratic National Convention.
   Doctors said it isn't known what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in the pool, but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac
arrest.
   Deaton said he expected Ms. Jordan to remain in intensive care
for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week.
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has been confined to a
wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis. She
swims as therapy.
   ``She has muscle weakness, and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being
discovered. Ms. Earl said she returned from a short errand to find
Ms. Jordan unconscious in the pool.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas.

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was
``vastly improved'' and giving the thumbs-up sign to her hospital
nurse Sunday following a near-drowning in her swimming pool.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a lung specialist treating Ms.
Jordan.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded from critical to serious but
stable, and she continued to improve Sunday night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, who gained national attention during the Nixon
impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to
Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after she was found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Deaton said she came within ``four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   Ms. Jordan apparently lost consciousness while in the pool.
Deaton and Dr. James Little, a neurologist, said it isn't known
what caused her to lose consciousness, but that the lack of oxygen
then caused cardiac arrest.
   Ms. Jordan had been in critical condition in the hospital's
intensive care unit, but Deaton said Sunday afternoon that ``she's
upgraded now. She's certainly stable, in a much less serious
condition.''
   Ms. Jordan was breathing without the aid of a mechanical
ventilator, responding to questions and trying to make sure a
Monday dental appointment was canceled. ``She obviously has pretty
good mental recall if that's her biggest concern,'' Deaton said.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' Little said. ``She's very close to normal
right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can
tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.''
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has used a wheelchair for
several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition
shouldn't have had an effect on the incident.
   ``She has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a
sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure. But hospital tests
showed ``her cardiac status has been very stable. She's had no
evidence of seizure activity,'' he said.
   Ms. Jordan delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential
candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. Bentsen telephoned a message to Ms. Jordan
on Sunday, said hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Hinckley Boyle.
   Visitors to the hospital have included Texas Treasurer Ann
Richards, who delivered the keynote address at the convention; Walt
Rostow, a former aide to President Lyndon Johnson; University of
Texas women's basketball Coach Jody Conradt; plus Ms. Jordan's two
sisters and live-in companion, Nancy Earl, who found Ms. Jordan in
the pool.
   Ms. Jordan is a fan of the University of Texas' Lady Longhorns,
and nurse Barbara Tucker said the basketball team's former star,
Fran Harris, visited before leaving for the Olympic trials.
   ``When I remember seeing Ms. Jordan on TV, I frequently remember
the thumbs-up sign that things are OK. She's probably given me that
about 20 times today,'' Ms. Tucker said.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University

   Former Rep. Barbara Jordan, recovering from a near
drowning, talked politics with reporters and her nurses Thursday,
and said she's feeling much better.
   ``I really feel great. All I know is right now, I could not die
because this is the Democrats' year and I have got to be around to
celebrate it,'' said Ms. Jordan, 52, who remained in fair condition
at Brackenridge Hospital.
   Ms. Jordan gave the seconding speech for Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate at the party's
recent Democratic National Convention.
   Sitting in a chair in her hospital room, Ms. Jordan remarked on
the good wishes she has received from across the nation.
   ``I have received cards, telegrams, letters, flowers from all
over this country,'' she said. ``If I did have the desire to return
to active politics, I think I could make a good run at national
office. I am very grateful and I feel very fortunate to have so
many people feel do deeply and care so much for me.''
   The former three-term congresswoman and first black state
senator in Texas history said she has no plans to leave her current
teaching job at the University of Texas' Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs.
   ``My plans were and are to continue to teach ... and to continue
to educate young minds to take over this country,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan said she didn't remember much about the accident that
happened around noon Saturday. She lost consciousness while in her
backyard swimming pool and was found face-down in the pool by her
roommate.
   Ms. Jordan, who uses a wheelchair because she suffers from what
doctors say is a disease similar to multiple sclerosis, swims for
exercise. She said she hopes the accident won't make her afraid to
continue.
   ``I hope that I'm not traumatized by this event so I refrain
from doing that ... I enjoyed it,'' she said.
   She also said she was grateful for the efforts of the emergency
medical service technicians and hospital helicopter crew who
rescued her.
   ``It's a compilation of people who did superb work to see to it
that I can sit here today and talk to you. And I thank them and am
grateful for it,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan is being treated in the hospital's critical care
unit. Doctors said she may remain hospitalized for about four more
days.

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan remained in
critical condition early Sunday after she was found floating
unconscious in her swimming pool, authorities said.
   ``She's been awake off and on through the night, but she goes
right to sleep,'' said Sheryln Gembol, a nursing supervisor at
Brackenridge Hospital. ``We're trying to let her rest.
   ``They're going to be running some more tests throughout the day
today. They know it was not a heart attack or a stroke, but as far
as what made her unconscious in the pool, they're not sure,'' she
added.
   Ms. Jordan, who rose to fame during the Watergate impeachment
hearings, was found in the pool about noon Saturday by a woman who
lives with her.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
Paramedics ``said she had a pulse, was trying to breathe and they
were able to help her breathe en route to hospital,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Carolyn Boyle.
   At a briefing late Saturday, a doctor said Ms. Jordan was being
treated for fluid in her lungs but showed no signs of heart or
brain dysfunction.
   ``She has full recovery of her intellectual functions. Her vital
signs are much better,'' Dr. William Deaton said. Though she
remained in critical condition, ``the capital `c' is not so big as
when she got here.''
   ``She has to heal her own lungs, which she will hopefully do,''
added Deaton, a lung specialist. He said Ms. Jordan apparently lost
consciousness while swimming alone in the pool, for unknown
reasons. A lack of oxygen then caused the cardiac arrest, he said.
   Ms. Jordan has had medical problems for several years and has
used a wheelchair to get to her job on the faculty of the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.
   Ms. Jordan has refused to discuss the illness, calling it ``a
mobility problem'' and denying it was Lou Gehrig's disease or bone
cancer. Deaton described it as a progressive loss of ``nerve
function in her lower extremities'' similar to multiple sclerosis.
   In 1966, Ms. Jordan became the first black state senator in
Texas. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction.
   She gained a national reputation during the House Judiciary
Committee's 1974 hearings that ended with a vote to press
impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon. She stirred
television audiences when she declared, ``My faith in the
Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total.''

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan,
hospitalized after nearly drowning, talked politics over breakfast
Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Carolyn Hinckley Boyle said doctors described Ms. Jordan, 52, as
doing ``better _ much stronger, more cheerful.''
   Brackenridge Hospital listed Ms. Jordan in serious but stable
condition, which was unchanged.
   Ms. Jordan underwent tests Tuesday, including brain and chest
X-rays, as well a heart examination known as an echo cardiogram,
Ms. Boyle said.
   Nurse Greg Pfahles quoted Ms. Jordan as saying about the
Democratic presidential ticket, ``This is our year.''
   Ms. Boyle said Pfahles found Ms. Jordan ``fiesty and spunky but
a very pleasant and cooperative patient.''
   Ms. Jordan was hospitalized Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her backyard pool.
   In 1966, she became the first black state senator in Texas

   When a congressman ``fed up with crime'' found a
suspected burglar in his own house, he armed himself with a tree
limb, threatened to break the man's legs and held him until police
came.
   ``I don't recommend that people do this, but I guess it was just
instinct,'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., said after Tuesday's
confrontation.
   Towns, 54, said he was at his Brooklyn home when a man entered
through a second-floor window.
   ``I heard the noise, went into the room and saw him, then I
yelled,'' Towns said. The would-be burglar climbed back out the
window as Towns tried to grab the man's leg.
   Towns ran from the house and waited near his garage while the
burglar jumped from the roof.
   The congressman, holding the tree limb, told the man, ``Don't
get up, if you do I'm going to break your legs,'' he said. Towns'
wife called police.
   The man, who was not armed, was charged with burglary and
criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Police said he would not
give his name.
   ``I'm just so sick and tired and fed up with crime,'' Towns
said. ``We have to do everything we possibly can to eliminate
crime.''

   Sporting a ``Where was George?'' button and
flashing a broad smile, former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan left a
hospital Monday, more than a week after she nearly drowned in her
swimming pool.
   ``Thank you for my life,'' Ms. Jordan, 52, told emergency
medical personnel and nurses who cared for her during her stay at
Brackenridge Hospital.
   Dr. William Deaton said Ms. Jordan is ``in excellent condition,
and she should return to her normal lifestyle within a couple of
weeks.''
   There is no explanation of what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in her pool on July 30, Deaton said. He said it was
most likely a heart rhythm disturbance.
   The ``Where was George'' button refers to a Democratic National
Convention speech by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that criticized
Vice President George Bush's role in the Reagan administration.

   Actor LeVar Burton attributes his downfall
after ``Roots'' to money, drugs and women, but says meditation is
responsible for his comeback.
   Burton, who played the African slave boy Kunta Kinte in
``Roots,'' recently landed a part on ``Star Trek: The New
Generation.''
   ``I lost my balance,'' Burton said in an interview for an
article to appear in TV Guide's Aug. 13 edition. ``It turned my
world upside down and it took me a long time to find myself again.''
   Burton, 31, said he began psychotherapy just over three years
ago. He developed an interest in spiritualism and began meditating,
practiced ``Rolfing,'' a process of strenuous body manipulation,
breathing, fire-walking and even ``leaped blindfolded off a 30-foot
pole as a way of challening his fear,'' the article said.
   As he began to piece his life back together, Burton said he
decided to use spiritualism to will himself back into a good acting
job.

spenders might talk to 22-year-old Marc Homer, an alternate Wyoming
delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   Homer managed to attend the four-day convention on less than $25
dollars a day.
   ``I rode the bus out here and am staying in a dorm room at
Georgia Tech for $15 a night,'' he said Thursday. The 44-hour bus
ride cost $69 and he will spend the same amount on a circuitous
route home.
   ``I haven't had to spend anything hardly on food,'' he added.
``There are so many parties with free food.''

   Barbara Jordan helped came to the aid of fellow
Texan Lloyd Bentsen by dismissing suggestions the senator is a
conservative and weak on civil rights.
   In a speech seconding Bentsen's vice presidential nomination,
the black former congresswoman described him as an ally of ``our
most vulnerable citizens'' and a ``common-sense good candidate.''
   Delegates on Thursday cheered and chanted ``Barbara, Barbara''
as Ms. Jordan was wheeled to the podium for her speech. She is

   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski says the Democrats in his

can return to their party now that Lloyd Bentsen is on the ticket.
   Rostenkowski said in his speech nominating the Texas senator
that his district houses people who ``run our stores, work in our

   Republican officials boast they will do
better than the Democrats and have seats to spare when the GOP
holds its national convention next month in the spacious Louisiana
Superdome,
   Democrats held their convention this week in Atlanta at The
Omni, which could hold only about 11,000 people. More than 14,000
people attended the four-day convention, and the coliseum had to be
closed off several nights.
   The Superdome will have room for an estimated 40,000 people when
the Republicans assemble Aug. 15-18. Nadine Wong, a convention
management spokeswoman, said she expects about 30,000 people to
attend the four-day event, and some of the space may be made
available to the general public.

   Pop diva Madonna was ordered by a judge
Thursday to trim a hedge and pine tree at her Hollywood Hills home.
   Superior Court Judge Sally Disco ruled Madonna violated an
agreement with neighbor Donald Robinson requiring her to keep her
shrubbery trimmed so it wouldn't interfere with his view.
   The judge rejected Robinson's claim of $1 million damages for
the loss of his view, but she ordered Madonna to pay Robinson's
attorney fees.
   Liz Rosenberg, publicist for the singer, was out of the office
Thursday and couldn't be reached, a receptionist said. Madonna's
lawyer, Meghan Serwin, and Robinson's attorney, Robert Rigdon, were
not in their offices Thursday for comment.
   Madonna said in a deposition she bought the house above the
Sunset Strip because of its spectacular view and privacy. But after
she moved in, she said she noticed gardeners peering through her
hedges.
   Disco ruled there was insufficient evidence to support Madonna's
cross-claim against Robinson that said he had harmed her by
infringing on her privacy.

   SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Dolly Parton's younger sister has
filed a worker's compensation lawsuit against the theme park the
entertainer owns.
   Freida Parton, 33, said she injured her back closing a dressing
room door at Dollywood, in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains.
   In the lawsuit filed this week in Sevier County Chancery Court,
Freida Parton says she sustained the injury on June 10, 1989, and
underwent back surgery.
   She seeks unspecified benefits under the state's worker's
compensation act.
   Barbara Headla, marketing manager at Dollywood, did not return a
telephone message left at the park.
   Freida Parton and her twin brother, Floyd, are the
next-to-youngest of the 12 Parton siblings.
   Dolly Parton opened Dollywood in 1985. She co-starred in ``Steel
Magnolias'' last year and was host of 1987's short-lived variety
television series ``Dolly.''

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Former congresswoman Barbara Jordan has
agreed to serve as special counsel on ethics for Gov.-elect Ann
Richards.
   ``Barbara Jordan is recognized throughout the country as one of
the most important voices in ethics and government that one could
possibly have,'' Richards said Wednesday.
   In 1966, Jordan became the state's first black state senator. In
1972, she was the first black elected to Congress from the South
since Reconstruction.
   Once considered a possible Democratic vice presidential
candidate, Jordan ended her political career after three terms in
the House. She became a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texss.
   Richards said Jordan would counsel members of her administration
on ethical conduct and help draft legislation on ethics.
   Bill Cryer, Richards' press secretary, said Jordan was taking
the post on ``an unpaid, voluntary basis'' and would continue
teaching.

   LONDON (AP) - Dame Joan Sutherland is coming out of retirement
after just two months, but for only one performance: a New Year's
Eve farewell to Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House said Thursday.
   Sutherland, the coloratura soprano with amazing voice range,
will be joined by Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and U.S.
mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne.
   ``Although Dame Joan has retired, she wants to make this one -
and only one - exception, to come to London to say goodbye to
Covent Garden where she began her opera career in 1952,'' said
Kathleen Wilkinson, the Royal Opera spokeswoman.
   Sutherland, 64, will play the ``star guest'' at Prince
Orlofsky's party in Act II of ``Die Fledermaus'' by Johann Strauss.
The opera will be conducted by her husband, Richard Bonynge and
will be televised live by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Pavarotti and Horne will appear as fellow party guests.
   Sutherland, known as ``La Stupenda'' (the magnificent one),
retired Oct. 2 with a performance in her hometown of Sydney,
Australia.
   In October, Sutherland withdrew from performances at Covent
Garden, saying she wanted people to remember her voice in its
prime.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Beach Boys' reclusive founder Brian Wilson
made a private concert appearance before a group that included
political cartoonist Garry Trudeau as the two joined in an AIDS
fund-raising effort.
   Looking uncomfortable in a dark suit and tie, a nervous Wilson
played piano and sang Wednesday at the private reception. A few
dozen patrons paid at least $125 each for the 15-minute
performance.
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Wilson said after the performance. ``I had to
close my eyes. That's the only way I can really feel my music,
closing my eyes.''
   Wilson had said before the show that he was ``scared to death.''
   Trudeau, creator of the comic strip ``Doonesbury,'' sat
cross-legged on the floor during the concert.
   Among other tunes, Wilson played selections from the Beach Boys'
1966 ``Pet Sounds'' album, which recently came out on compact disc.
Andy Lippincott, a character in ``Doonesbury'' who died from AIDS,
had looked forward to the disc's release.
   Before the reception, Wilson and Trudeau attended the opening of
an art galley with 59 original drawings of editions of the comic
strip that dealt with Lippincott's death.
   The drawings are being sold to raise money for the NAMES
Project, which is coordinating the construction of a huge memorial
quilt dedicated to AIDS victims.

<HEAD>Delegates Finally Get a Towering _ A Really Towering _ Democrat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For once, a really towering Democrat _ not the
towering kind evoked in political rhetoric _ addressed the
Democratic National Convention.
   Bill Bradley, the senator from New Jersey who once played on two
world champion New York Knicks basketball teams, got the kind of
reception from convention delegates that marks him as a political
comer.
   The hall blossomed with orange and blue signs, not for Michael
Dukakis or Jesse Jackson, but for ``Bill Bradley, New Jersey's
pride.''
   At 6-foot-5, Bradley was too tall to use the prompting devices
on either side of the podium, so his speech was scrolled up on a
television screen across the hall.
   ``This is a real first for me tonight,'' he said. ``It's the
first time I've spoken to a national convention and the first time
I've performed in The Omni wearing long pants.''
   The convention hall normally is used for Atlanta Hawks games.
   Bradley made everybody's list of vice presidential possibilities
early in the Democratic campaign, but he took himself out of
consideration last month.
   ``Does it make any difference who is president of the United
States?'' he asked.
   ``Did Lincoln make a difference? Did Woodrow Wilson ... Ask
anyone who lived through the depression if Franklin Delano
Roosevelt made a difference. Ask any European who has democracy if
Harry Truman made any difference. Ask anyone who cares about human
rights if Jimmy Carter made a difference.''
   By the time Bradley took the microphone, before Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen's name was put in nomination for the vice presidency, the
convention hall was filled to overflowing.
   The delegates let loose with some of the most enthusiastic
cheering of the night when former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, a
heroine of Democrats since the Watergate days of Richard Nixon,
seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``Why?'' she asked. ``First of all because he's my senator and I
wasn't planning to come to this convention for any purpose'' other
than that.
   ``Our minds are turning away from `Hooray for Hollywood' and we
are now confronted with the hard reality of a natioln which desires
to become solvent again,''
   ``We want to retake the moral high ground,'' she said.
   ``The rostrum was lowered to desk height to accommodate Ms.
Jordan's wheelchair. She suffers from a degenerative bone disease.
   True to his word, the fire marshal closed the doors at 7:30
p.m., shutting out hundreds for the third night. The smart people
got in early.
   Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, the oldest House member at age
87, sat on the front row of his state's delegation for his 13th
Democratic convention _ every one since 1940 when Roosevelt was
nominated for his third term.
   ``It's a well-run convention, well-handled,'' he said. ``It
shows Dukakis' good management skills. We're going to be
victorious.''
   But you couldn't sell that to many Democrats who had to miss
dinner to make it inside the hall. Long lines formed at The Omni's
food concessions, where the menu consisted of pizza, hot dogs,
popcorn and ice cream bars.
   Inevitably, some concessions ran out of food.
   That did nothing to dampen the spirit of John Economos, a
restaurateur from Des Moines, Iowa. He carried a hand-lettered sign
that read, ``Vote for Dukakis and Bentsen.'' Nothing unusual about
that, except it was in Greek.
   All was hope and promise in the convention hall on the last
night.
   ``Do you feel the excitement in the air?'' asked the chairman,
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   ``Yes!'' shouted the delegates.
   ``Are we going carry the South this year?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Will we win in November?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Do you promise me that?''
   ``Yes!''

<HEAD>Gramm: Convention Will Have Texas Accent</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's Republican National Convention will
have a distinct Texas accent, says the man who will nominate George
Bush for president.
   ``It is clear in this convention that I'm doing the nominating
and another Texan's doing the accepting, and that's pretty much
what conventions are about. So it's a Texas show from that point of
view,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Monday.
   However, Gramm said, those watching the GOP convention will hear
something quite different from last month's Democratic convention,
where Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards set the tone with several
wisecracks about Bush during her keynote speech including that the
wealthy vice president was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   ``You're going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the
speeches you heard at the Democratic convention,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he plans to use his speech to highlight the
differences between Vice President Bush and Dukakis.
   ``I am not a good name-caller. People don't care what I think
about Michael Dukakis in terms of some cutesy-poo thing I might
call him,'' he said.
   Still, Texas Republicans have a tough act to follow.
   Texas Democratic Party officials have referred jokingly to last
month's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta as their state
convention due to the prominent role played by Texans.
   Among them were Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential
nominee; Ms. Richards, the keynoter; U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright
of Fort Worth, convention chairman; former U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan, who seconded Bentsen's nomination; Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower, who gave a prime-time speech, and state Rep. Lena
Guerrero, D-Austin, who helped present the party platform to
delegates.
   Democrats also believe the selection of Bentsen as Dukakis'
running mate will help their ticket carry Texas, the nation's
third-largest state, and its 29 electoral votes. A total of 270
electoral votes are needed to win the presidency.
   ``The campaign in Texas is going to be a hotly contested
campaign,'' Gramm said. ``We've got to put before the people of
Texas those two records. If we don't win in Texas given Michael
Dukakis' record, we don't deserve to win.''

convention, Jurek Martin finds Bush-bashing to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST night of an American political convention is the overture to the
work of the week, and the Democrats certainly sang it in harmony on Monday.
But not everybody belted it out with the same raucous vigour.
Take the lead tenor from New Jersey. There was a time when Bill Bradley
could hold an audience in Madison Square Garden in the palm of his hand on
any given evening.
That stopped 15 years ago. 'Bradley back in the Garden' - to quote the
buttons on every New Jersey delegate in sight - was not wearing basketball
sneakers and a number 24 shirt, but the dark suit and tie of a professional
politician increasingly regarded as the Democratic party's thoughtful
conscience and, albeit less widely, as its best presidential candidate - not
this year but before too long.
Senator Bradley's keynote address on Monday night showed him at his least,
and most, impressive. On the down side, one conclusion is safe. Rumour has
it that he has spent almost as many hours practising his public speaking as
he did his jump shot. If so, it was to much less effect.
The Garden did not hang on his every word, not in comparison to his
fellow-keynote speakers. Governor Zell Miller of Georgia, for example, had
them rocking in the aisles with his full-frontal assault on the Republican
opposition.
Yet even he paled into insignificance when the final act. Barbara Jordan,
black and now confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, delivered a
soaring, cadenced civics lecture, in its way as memorable as the address she
gave in the same arena to the 1976 convention when a congresswoman from
Texas.
As a formal speaker, Mr Bradley still lacks the necessary attributes of
timing and delivery. He swallows his good lines and talks on when his
audience is applauding.
There are other considerations. First, one speech does not necessarily a
political summer or winter make. Mr Mario Cuomo gave a great one to the 1984
convention and is still only governor of New York; Governor Bill Clinton
delivered a terrible one to the 1988 convention and is about to be the
Democratic presidential nominee.
Second, there was, as ever, substance to the Bradley speech. The theme -
facing up to collective responsibilities rather than indulging in
'individual thrills' - is not new for him, but he is developing it all the
time. It is one that is not easily reduced to slogans.
'What we face is a crisis of meaning,' he said in one of his pithier
passages. 'Without meaning, there can be no hope; without hope there can be
no struggle, and without struggle there can be no personal betterment.
Individualism degenerates into greed without agreement on its limits. The
microchip may be faster than the human brain but it isn't connected to a
heart. A new drug might defeat a disease but it won't eradicate hatred.'
Or, again on a more hopeful note: 'It is sometimes said Americans lack a
sense of tragic life. It would be more correct to say that Americans are not
content to let tragedy have the last word. The United States is history's
greatest experiment in the elimination of despair.'
This is the sort of reflective philosophy that political conhear. Add to
them Barbara Jordan's reflections - the need for equality of sacrifice,
including social entitlement programmes, the impermissibility of racism, be
it black or white, and the imperative of valuing reason over emotion in
assessing character - and it cannot be said that the Democrats were sent
home to bed with nothing to think about.
The vague sense of dislocation is that this was not the intended dual theme
of the first night. One part of this was to be a lot of Bush-bashing, to
which Mr Bradley ponderously contributed. Perot-pulverising, however, was
much less in the score, though there was some of it from Governor Miller.
The Democrats have worked out that the Bush-Perot conflict helps them.
The other element was to demonstrate that this is no longer a party of
pot-smoking, draft-dodging subversives - not in living memory have its
delegates been presented with such an orgy of flag-waving patriotism,
derived from Republican choreography.
Emotions were wound up not, as in days of yore, by the haunting and
socially-conscious songs of Woody Guthrie (This Land is Your Land) and by
gospel choirs, but by a succession of marching and big bands straight out of
high school and Las Vegas floor shows. This was designed as a celebration of
America, marred only by the fact that a whole line of white tubas was
clearly emblazoned with the name of their Japanese manufacturer.
Dissent was also dismissed with Republican efficiency. When 600-odd
delegates began chanting 'let Jerry speak' on behalf of the former governor
of California, the other Brown, Ron, the party chairman, moved briskly to
other business. It will require an act of some magnanimity for the
Californian to be permitted to address the convention. Mr Nelson Mandela,
who is to speak tonight, was much easier to fit in at short notice.
Hardly a word was heard from the podium that might embarrass the party
nominee. Barbara Boxer, running for the Senate from California, got in a dig
at the free trade agreement with Mexico, which Mr Clinton basically
supports, and Mr David Dinkins, New York mayor, went further than Mr Clinton
in demanding that US cities be rebuilt before those in Russia.
But that was about it. Unless Mr Cuomo, who is to nominate Mr Clinton
tonight, publicly urges him to come clean and raise taxes, as he did on
television on Sunday, departure from the party line is not scripted.
The delegates responded to this new direction. They cheered at every
invocation of their national spirit and at every imprecation against the
Republicans. The Idaho delegation leader epitomised the spirit of the night
by declaring that he was from 'the state which knows how to spell potato'
(which Vice-President Dan Quayle does not).
In this mood, they might have expected something more rollicking from Bill
Bradley. When he talked, so did they, among themselves, which is standard
practice most of the time, but not necessarily in front of keynote speakers
in prime televised time. It took a Jordanesque gift of oratory to make them
listen.
It was indeed a first night which, for all that its target was
middle-America, was not without its subtle contradictions. Mr Clinton will
have to square them when he speaks before the final curtain.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen to be his running mate drew praise from fellow Democrats
today, with several of them likening it to another
Massachusetts-Texas ticket _ John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
in 1960.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., younger brother of the late
president.
   Dukakis and Bentsen both were quick to draw the comparison
between this campaign and the one 28 years ago.
   ``The Massachusetts and the Texas ex'es were good for the
country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's going to
be a real winner in November of 88,'' Bentsen said today.
   ``Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential
act _ if I can use that word _ that I will do,'' Dukakis said in
introducing his running mate. ``Lloyd Bentsen brings to this ticket
and will bring to this nation years of experience.''
   Bentsen's ``selection gives the Democratic Party a strong ticket
for November _ and even more important, the strong prospect of
eight solid years of effective new leadership for America,''
Kennedy said.
   Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards, who will be the keynote
speaker at next week's Democratic convention in Atlanta, called
Bentsen ``a level guy'' who ``will make a great vice president''
and added:
   ``There's always been a sort of Austin-to-Boston, Mass.,
connection, and I think that this ticket adds that same sort of
magic.''
   Ms. Richards also said that Bentsen would boost Democrats'
chances in Texas, one of the states that Dukakis' likely Republican
opponent, George Bush, calls home.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose own hopes for the presidential
nomination were dashed earlier this year, agreed that Bentsen could
help the Democratic ticket in Texas and said he thought the Texas
senator might help the Democrats carry Oklahoma and Louisiana as
well.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker,'' Simon
said. ``This is an excellent choice, and this is a winning ticket.
   ``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will be
boosted immediately and, when the American people get to know Lloyd
Bentsen, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' Simon added.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who will deliver the nominating
speech for Dukakis, said he also believed that Bentsen would help
the Democrats carry Texas and would help the party across the
region.
   ``I like and respect him very much,'' Clinton said.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she believes ``Lloyd Bentsen
will be a fine addition to the Democratic ticket. He knows his
issues and he knows his politics. Best of all,'' she said, ``he
knows how to beat George Bush. He did just that in 1970 to become
U.S. senator.''
   In Florida, where Democrats had been pushing home state Sen. Bob
Graham for the No. 2 spot on the Dukakis ticket, state Rep. Mike
Abrams also offered praise for Bentsen and said a Dukakis-Bentsen
victory in his state is ``doable.''
   ``We all know it's going to be tough,'' said Abrams, who is
coordinator of the Dukakis campaign in Florida. But, he added, the
choice of Bentsen ``shows a sensitivity to the South'' and ``brings
defense and foreign policy and Washington experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.
   Even backers of Jesse Jackson, who came in second to Dukakis in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the Massachusetts governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with Bentsen.
   Florida state Rep. James Burke, who was the state campaign
coordinator for Jackson, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had Jesse.'' He added, though, that ``Bentsen is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying that the Texas
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
Walter Mondale's running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of Bentsen.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor Dukakis intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   On the Republican side, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on Bush's
ticket, said he thought Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, called Bentsen ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that Bush would be able to
carry Texas.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority
leader, had been); nor is Dukakis John Kennedy.''

   Ann Richards, tapped as the keynote speaker
for the Democratic National Convention, said today she will consult
with advisers to apparent nominee Michael Dukakis and rival Jesse
Jackson before preparing her speech.
   She also suggested, on a light note, that she might be a
good-luck charm for the party.
   Noting that fellow Texan Barbara Jordan was the only previous
female keynoter at a Democratic Convention, in 1976, she said,
``That year the Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw
my selection, having another female, as a good omen.''
   Before the convention, she said in an interview on CBS-TV, ``I
wanted to be sure to look at the Democratic platform. I wanted to
consult with both the Dukakis campaign and the Jackson campaign.
And of course I welcome any help and any advice that I get.''
   Ms. Richards is known for using blunt rhetoric tempered with
wicked humor to get her point across.
   At a recent Democratic Party fundraiser in Houston, one man
after another _ none of them minorities _ came to the podium to
speak. Finally it was the turn of Ms. Richards, the Texas state
treasurer and potential 1990 gubernatorial candidate.
   ``Now are there any other white men who haven't spoken yet?''
she said sweetly. ``God knows we don't want to leave any of you
out.''
   The audience roared with laughter, as Ms. Richards' audiences
usually do. And, as usual, her audience got the message.
   On Monday, her stump style was praised by Democratic Party chief
Paul G. Kirk as he announced her selection as the speaker whose
address will open the party's convention next month in Atlanta.
   The 54-year-old Ms. Richards, Kirk said at a Washington news
conference, ``has the ability to tell it like it is.''
   Kirk said Dukakis had urged the selection of a woman keynote
speaker, the first since Rep. Jordan shared that honor with John
Glenn.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' the party chief said, ``not only because of the importance
of the family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives,
but I think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the
American family and the realities of all of that.''
   Ms. Richards, the first woman in 50 years to hold statewide
office in Texas, is the divorced mother of four grown children.
   In 1976, her first attempt at elected office, Ms. Richards
defeated an incumbent Travis County commissioner. In 1982, the
state's incumbent treasurer, under indictment for official
misconduct, withdrew from a Democratic runoff against her. She won
the general election and was re-elected without opposition in 1986.
   After the 1982 election, Ms. Richards moved quickly to change
operations in the state treasury. She also made staff changes,
boosting the number of women and minorities on the job in the
170-employee agency. She now claims the agency payroll has an
ethnic and sex balance reflecting the state's general population.
   Ms. Richards said Monday that women's issues are ``the same
issues that affect all other human beings'' _ but with a twist.
   ``The difference is the role, sociologically, that women have
played. That is we are the caretakers, the nurturers,'' she says.
``It usually falls to us when any time hard times and bad times
hit.''
   It's a message often repeated by Ms. Richards. If you can make a
household work, she says, you can succeed in government.
   ``Most homemakers don't know what enormous skills they have.
Putting three meals on the table each day is a pretty big job in
itself, much less doing the laundry and car pooling,'' she once
told a reporter.
   Her professional success has come despite personal challenges.
In 1980, after being confronted by family members, she sought
treatment for alcoholism. She says she has not had a drink since
then, and she has been active in helping others battle alcoholism.
   Shortly after her treatment, she and husband David Richards
separated, and in 1984 the two obtained what they both said was an
amicable divorce.
   Richards, a lawyer, was on hand Monday when his ex-wife talked
to reporters about being selected to give the keynote speech. She
acknowledged him as someone who ``played a very large role in my
life, politically and personally.''
   Beyond the convention and helping to put a Democrat in the White
House, Ms. Richards' most immediate goal is the 1990 Texas
gubernatorial race. She has not formally declared her intentions,
but sent out her first exploratory fund-raising letter Monday.
   Ms. Richards said she is not certain what effect her half-hour
in the political spotlight in Atlanta will have on her
gubernatorial race.
   ``I suppose if I'm good it will help,'' she said Monday. ``And
if I'm bad it won't.''

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milder winds and temperatures gave
firefighters the upper hand today in a wildfire that engulfed 524
homes and businesses in Santa Barbara County and in other blazes
that burned more than 90 homes.
   Two Californians died in the fires _ a state prisoner serving as
a firefighter and a 37-year-old Santa Barbara woman found near the
wreckage of her home in a burned-out neighborhood, authorities said
today.
   Wildfires, most set by arsonists, charred more than 18,700 acres
by Thursday in a six-county area north, east and south of Los
Angeles. Arson was blamed for the Santa Barbara fire and another
that charred 66 homes in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale before
it was contained.
   Losses could surpass $500 million in Santa Barbara County and
$30 million in Glendale, officials said.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said Kay O'Brien, who
fled her Santa Barbara home with her husband carrying only family
pictures and a retirement watch. The home and all their possessions
were lost.
   A county survey completed late Thursday found 524 structures
destroyed, including 315 single family homes. Officials previously
said 567 homes and businesses had been destroyed.
   Calm wind and overnight temperatures in the 50s helped 800
firefighters subdue the blaze. Officials hoped to contain the fire
by noon Saturday, said Juanita Freel, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Forest Service.
   ``It's pretty calm out there now,'' Robert Ooley, a Santa
Barbara County fire spokesman, said today. ``It's still smoldering
somewhat, but it's nothing like before. It's certainly on the
downside now.''
   Elsewhere, firefighters controlled blazes in Utah and at
Yellowstone National Park in Montana, but large fires raged in
Arizona, Texas and Colorado. In Arizona, where six firefighters
died Tuesday, a lightning fire in the Tonto National Forest
destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by Western novelist Zane Grey.
   In California, Gov. George Deukmejian declared states of
emergency in the Santa Barbara and Glendale areas. The governor
also authorized separate $50,000 rewards for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the arsonists in both blazes.
   Hospitals reported admitting 13 people for fire-related injuries
and treating 55 others.
   Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the state forestry department,
said in a statement this morning that a state prisoner died as a
result of injuries suffered while fighting a Riverside County fire.
   The victim was Victor Ferrara, 22, according to spokeswoman
Patty Perez of the San Bernardino Medical Center. Ferrara, who died
late Thursday, was burned when his crew was overrun by wind-driven
flames, Ms. Terrill said.
   In all, 1,200 state prisoners are helping in the firefighting
effort.
   In Santa Barbara, the body Andrea Gurka, 37, was found this
morning in a creek bed behind her home in the area where the fire
began, said county fire spokesman Charlie Johnson.
   ``She apparently had attempted to flee her residence when it was
being overrun by flames Wednesday evening,'' Johnson said.
   Late Thursday, in the suburban community of Claremont, 30 miles
east of Los Angeles, an arson-suspected blaze burned out of control
along brush-laden hillsides and consumed 400 acres, authorities
said. Police blocked several residential streets although no homes
were evacuated.
   Police in Glendale were looking for two young men after
witnesses said they saw one of them toss a butane lighter from a
moving car into the brush off the road where the fire started, said
Chris Gray, a Glendale Fire Department battalion chief.
   The 4,000-acre arson fire that broke out late Wednesday in a
valley between Santa Barbara and the nearby town of Goleta was one
of the worst on record here. Damage to homes alone was estimated
initially at $190 million, and the figure was expected to top $500
million, said county Supervisor Bill Wallace.
   No more homes appeared threatened today.
   Authorities have said an incendiary device was found at the
fire's origin, but they haven't given details.
   The Santa Barbara City Council voted Thursday to call off the
July 4 fireworks at the city beach. Mayor Sheila Lodge implored
residents not to celebrate with their own fireworks. Santa Barbara,
which posted a record 109 degrees Wednesday, has tinder-dry foliage.
   A U.S. Forest Service helicopter dropping water on flames
crashed Thursday afternoon in San Marcos Pass. The pilot suffered
only scrapes and bruises.
   Firefighters surrounded 60 percent of a 4,500-acre wildfire in
Corona in Riverside County today, but not before it destroyed eight
homes, said Capt. David Parks of the California Department of
Forestry.
   The blaze was set as a controlled burn June 19 in the Cleveland
National Forest but jumped fire lines three times, officials said.
   A 2,500-acre blaze burning today near Lake Henshaw in San Diego
County forced the evacuation of a Boy Scout camp and 20 homes,
authorities said.
   Four earlier brush fires in the county blackened about 1,700
acres before firefighters contained the blazes.
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area that straddles Orange
and San Bernardino counties blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at
least 14 homes. Officials hoped to control the blaze late today,
state Department of Forestry Capt. Jerry Hendershot said.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' said
department spokeswoman Sharon Sellers. ``We're not happy about
that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigation of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   In east-central Arizona, officials said the 24,000-acre Tonto
National Forest fire was about 50 percent contained this morning.
The fire that began with a lightning strike has destroyed about 50
homes and forced the evacuation of more than 1,200 people.

<HEAD>Cast As Conservative, Bentsen Celebrates Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen, cast in the role of
conservative on the new Democratic ticket, has decided not to bury
his differences with the more liberal Michael Dukakis, but to
praise them.
   Before millions of Americans who watched Thursday's convention
on prime-time television, the Texas senator served notice that he
does not believe Democrats must ``march in lockstep'' to win the
White House.
   His speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential
nominee, and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by
Dukakis' oratory. But Bentsen had his own way of telling his party
he balances the ticket nicely:
   Democrats, he said, ``are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland
porridge of privilege ... We have differences of opinion. But on
the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.''
   If the party does not expect great things of Bentsen's rhetoric,
it does expect great things of him in November. The senator, whose
name has been described as ``magic'' in the state of Texas, was
picked for the ticket to win his home state, and its 29 electoral
votes, for the Democrats.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen camp has also made it clear Bentsen will
spend a good deal of time in the South, which has been Reagan-Bush
territory of late.
   Bentsen and his aides have stressed those issues on which he and
Dukakis agree: economic growth, jobs creation, women's rights and
better housing, health care and education for all citizens.
   But Bentsen is more conservative than Dukakis and many Democrats
on many issues, including his support of school prayer, the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua and his opposition to gun control.
   Still, the quiet-spoken senator, who has a vaguely patrician
air, had plenty of supporters Thursday night.
   Dukakis, in his own remarks, paid tribute to Bentsen, saying he
would speak up if the National Security Council came up with the
``cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who nominated Bentsen and works
with him closely on Capitol Hill, called him ``straightforward ...
smart ... and tough.''
   ``He is a sensible, reasonable, rational, common-sense good
choice for vice president of the United States,'' said former Rep.
Barbara Jordan of Texas. ``I believe that he is the best choice you
could come up with to give us a strong and winning ticket this
November.''
   Bentsen also won praise from Jesse Jackson for his longtime
support of civil rights. On Thursday, just as Bentsen's name was
being entered in nomination, Jackson issued a written endorsement
of the senator.
   ``While I may disagree with both Governor Dukakis and Senator
Bentsen on some important issues, our interests converge in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall,'' Jackson
said.
   Still, when the voice vote was taken to acclaim Bentsen the
nominee, many Jackson supporters shouted ``no,'' voicing their
continued displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the
ticket. Fifteen members of Bentsen's Texas delegation refused to
join in the celebration. Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' were
sprinkled through the convention hall.
   Bentsen's own speech drew loud and sustained applause only when
he mentioned Dukakis, but the senator was unruffled.
   ``Just wonderful, really excited,'' he beamed as he left the
podium with Dukakis to attend a round of post-convention parties.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Finishes Radiation Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush is finished with the radiation
treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision
but will not know for at least two months how effective the
treatments have been.
   The first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on
Friday, said Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary.
   After receiving the 10-minute radiation dose at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, Mrs. Bush returned to the White House and took her
daily swim in the outdoor, heated swimming pool, said Ms. Perez.
   She also attended a briefing on the Head Start education
program, hosting volunteers from the organization.
   ``She feels great,'' said Ms. Perez.
   Doctors will not know for at least two months, and maybe as long
as four, whether the radiation was effective in treating the
symptoms of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that earlier
affected Mrs. Bush's thyroid as well, said Ms. Perez.
   Mrs. Bush began the radiation treatments after the steroid drug
prednisone failed to improve her eyes. She suffers eye irritation,
double vision and bulging eyes as a result of the Graves' disease,
which was diagnosed early last year.
   The disease initially caused her thyroid to be overproductive,
but a one-time radioactive treatment rendered the thyroid inactive
and cured that effect of the disease.
   The low-level radiation treatments were intended to decrease
swelling behind the eyes, in the small muscles that control eye
movement.
   Although suffering from eye irritation, Mrs. Bush has maintained
a schedule of public appearances, both with her husband and by
herself.
   Should the radiation fail, surgery would be an option, experts
say.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was 16 and home for the holidays from
finishing school. He was 17 and an Andover senior decked out in a
tux for the Christmas dance at a Greenwich, Conn., country club.
   It was December 1941. Three weeks earlier, America had gone to
war. George ``Poppy'' Bush already had decided to enlist as soon as
he turned 18.
   But on this evening, his attention was drawn to the tall,
slender girl with wavy, reddish-brown hair, twirling around the
dance floor in a green-and-red holiday dress with one of his tennis
buddies.
   The friend was happy to oblige Bush with an introduction to
Barbara Pierce of nearby Rye, N.Y.
   Before they reached the floor, the band switched from a Glenn
Miller tune to a waltz that was beyond Bush's dancing ability. So
the couple sat down and talked.
   And talked.
   A few nights later, on their first date, Bush borrowed his
folks' big car _ the one with the radio _ to fill the air in case
conversation faltered.
   But, as writer Donnie Radcliffe recounts in a new biography of
Barbara Bush, ``he need not have bothered.''
   ``Years later he would tease that she started talking that night
and hadn't stopped since,'' writes Radcliffe in ``Simply Barbara
Bush: A Portrait of America's Candid First Lady.''
   The book follows the Bushes from their wartime marriage to the
oil fields of Texas to the political career that led them from
Congress to China and now, after 29 moves in 44 years of marriage,
to the White House.
   Radcliffe, who has covered first ladies and the East Wing of the
White House for The Washington Post since 1969, recalls Bush saying
on a campaign flight last fall that if he won, ``there's one
prediction I'll make ... America will fall in love with Barbara
Bush.''
   ``America did,'' adds Radcliffe. ``In no time at all, her white
hair, her wrinkles, her size-14 figure and her fake pearls became
the new standards by which American women could measure themselves
_ and hope to measure up.''
   She clearly cuts a different figure than the petite ex-actress,
Nancy Reagan, who last occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   As Mrs. Bush quipped at a 1986 charity dinner: ``As you know, we
have a lot in common. ... She fights drugs; I fight illiteracy. She
wears a size three _ so's my leg.''
   Born in New York on June 8, 1925, she was the third of Marvin
and Pauline Pierce's four children.
   He was an engineer who turned to publishing. She was, in
Barbara's memory, an ``absolutely ravishing'' woman with a green
thumb, an inveterate joiner of civic causes and a spendthrift. The
Pierces lived well, but beyond their means, in a five-bedroom brick
home in upscale Rye.
   When Barbara's older sister Martha went off to Smith College,
Vogue immortalized her on its cover as ``College Girl of the Year.''
   Back home, Barbara was a tomboy, 5-foot-8 and 148 pounds at age
12. She recalls looking ``like Porky Pig.''
   At Ashley Hall, the finishing school in Charleston, S.C., she
set school records at speed-knitting, swimming underwater (2{ times
across the pool) and, according to Radcliffe, ``eating the most
hot, buttured biscuits in one meal without being caught.''
   After that holiday dance, the teen-age couple had a whirlwind,
if long distance, romance, with the letters postmarked ``ANDOVER''
turning up almost daily in Barbara's school mailbox. He took her to
his senior prom at the prestigious prep school outside Boston.
   A few weeks later, Bush joined the Navy and began the training
that would make him its youngest pilot.
   After Barbara's graduation in 1943, she spent 17 days with Bush
and his family at their oceanfront home in Maine, where she was a
hit with Dorothy Walker Bush, the clan's tennis-playing matriarch.
   Barbara dropped out of Smith College in 1944 after her freshman
year, planning to marry Bush in December.
   On Sept. 2, 1944, Bush's torpedo bomber, with ``Barbara''
painted on its side, was shot down by Japanese gunners during a
raid on Chichi Jima.
   Bush bailed out after dropping his four 500-pound bombs; the two
crewman with him didn't make it. An American submarine rescued the
flier, who returned home on Christmas Eve, with a Distinguished
Flying Cross and 58 combat missions.
   The wedding took place a few weeks late, on Jan. 6, 1945.
   Bush was mustered out of the Navy in August and enrolled at
Yale. Barbara worked part-time at the Yale Co-op and boasts that
``by the time we moved from Yale, I knew how to wash diapers and
cook dinner.''
   George Walker Bush, the first of their six kids, was born in
July 1946.
   Bush breezed through Yale in three years, making Phi Beta Kappa
as an economics major, captain of the baseball team, president of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and member of Skull and Bones, the
elite, secret student society.
   They headed off to Odessa, Texas, to embark on a career in the
oil fields.
   Pauline Pierce kept sending her daughter Tide until Barbara
convinced her mother the grocery stores in West Texas were bigger
than the ones in Rye. Mrs. Pierce was killed in a car accident in
1949.
   Tragedy struck again in 1953, when doctors told the Bushes their
3-year-old daughter, Robin, was dying of leukemia. They took her to
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York, where Barbara seldom
left her side. The child died 10 weeks before her 4th birthday.
   Her hair began going gray during Robin's illness. For years, at
the suggestion of her mother-in-law, she dyed the gray away, but
abandoned that in 1970, tired of the greenish hue her hair acquired
whenever she swam in a pool.
   Mrs. Bush was always a full-time mother, ferrying the children
to Little League games and myriad other activities, packing them
into the station wagon to drive to Kennebunkport each summer, and
meting out most of the discipline.
   She said earlier this year that when the family nest finally
emptied, ``I went through sort of a ... difficult time really
because suddenly women's lib had made me feel that my life had been
wasted.''
   The blues did not last long. She stepped up her volunteer
activities and discovered a favorite cause: literacy.
   ``I once spent the summer thinking of all the things that
bothered me _ teen pregnancy, drugs, everything _ and I realized
everything would be better if more people could read and write,''
said Mrs. Bush, who also had experienced the difficulties of
helping son Neil overcome dyslexia.
   She is often credited as serving as a goad to her husband's
social conscience.
   At times she has made headlines, including her ``rhymes with
rich'' crack about Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and support for a ban
on AK-47s after a man killed five children in a Stockton, Calif.,
schoolyard.
   She has since tried to steer clear of public policy statements.
   That ``muzzle'' is nothing new, she told reporters.
   ``I muzzled myself about 1967, when George went into the
Congress,'' she said. ``It's a decision I made many years ago that
when I disagreed with George Bush, I tell him in private.''

<HEAD>Fire Declared Controlled as Victims Face Mammoth Task of
Rebuilding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge Santa Barbara brush fire that burned
hundreds of homes was brought under control Tuesday as scores of
fire victims across Southern California began the formidable job of
recovery.
   The declaration was issued at 6 a.m., 5{ days after the blaze
was set by an arsonist in San Marcos Pass and blew down the
foothills of the coastal mountains through hundreds of homes on the
outskirts of Santa Barbara.
   A small crew of firefighters backed by a helicopter and two
engines watched for smoldering hotspots, but the blaze was
considered controlled because no flames showed within 300 feet of
fire lines cut through the brush.
   But while victory over the 4,500-acre fire took less than a
week, people burned out of more than 450 dwellings were only
beginning a long process of rebuilding and emotional recovery.
   It was the same story in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale,
where 66 hillside homes were damaged or destroyed in a arson blaze
June 27, and in the aftermath of a 6,640-acre blaze that straddled
the Orange-San Bernardino county line and destroyed 14 homes last
week. Both fires were caused by arson, officials said.
   In Santa Barbara and Glendale, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and state Office of Emergency Services opened centers to
take applications for low-interest loans and grants.
   Fires also continued to burn in Colorado and Texas.
   In California, organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation
Army continued supplying victims with immediate essentials,
including clothing, medicine, and in some cases psychological aid.
   ``The stress and emotional trauma is paramount right now. We
have many severely traumatized people,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman
Elizabeth Quirk in Santa Barbara.
   More than 340 families were registered with the Red Cross in
Santa Barbara and the number was expected to top 600. Six shelters
that housed more than 1,000 people during the fire were closed, and
efforts focused on finding regular housing.
   Red Cross, which already has committed $200,000 in direct
services to victims, will provide the first month's rent and
security deposit.
   The question will be whether there is enough housing in the
area, Ms. Quirk said.
   On the rebuilding front, Santa Barbara County was in its second
day of issuing demolition permits. On Monday, 280 people began the
permit process, said spokeswoman Jayne Brechwald.
   Residents also will need permits for temporary housing,
electrical poles and similar fixtures that must be in place before
construction can start. Permit fees were waived for the time being.
   A private relief center was established at the Goleta Youth
Sports Center to help people reach contractors, architects, and
real-estate and insurance agents.
   Despite the breadth of help coming to the region, experts
predicted a very lengthy recovery.
   ``We'll probably still be taking care of fire victims for at
least a year,'' Ms. Quirk said.
   Red Cross had on hand 650 local volunteers and was ready to
supply victims with some furnishings, occupational supplies like
uniforms and tools, and personal items like eyeglasses,
prescription medicines and dentures.
   Four roving food trucks have served 4,000 meals in the fire area
since the blaze began.
   Help has come from across North America. A Robinson's department
store gave Red Cross $50,000 for direct dispersal to victims.

<HEAD>Hundreds Return To Palm Springs Homes After Cloud Passes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three emergency workers were
hospitalized and several hundred people were evacuated from their
homes when a fire at a swimming pool supply company created a cloud
of chlorine gas, authorities said.
   The workers were released Saturday from Desert Hospital and no
serious injuries were reported in this desert resort, said police
Sgt. Tom Barton.
   The fire at Ocean Pool Mart broke out Friday evening, and
residents were asked to leave a 1-square-mile area, including Palm
Springs Regional Airport.
   Arriving commercial and private flights were diverted to Ontario
Airport, some 50 miles to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled
and the airport was evacuated, said city spokeswoman Barbara Erdman.
   The exact number of evacuees was not determined, but 150 people
went to an evacuation center at Raymond Cree Junior High School.
   Barton said people were allowed to return home about 9:30 p.m.
   Several people complained of breathing difficulty and eye
irritation, but no one other than the emergency workers was
hospitalized, Barton said.
   ``I could smell the chlorine in the air. It made my nose burn
and it gave me a slight headache,'' said Hazel Reed of Bakersfield,
who was vacationing in Palm Springs.
   ``When my chest started hurting, that's when I decided to leave
my home,'' said Donna Winters, who said her daughter also had chest
pains.
   Nina Smith said she at first ignored a police call to evacuate
her home because she was afraid to venture out on foot.
   ``I stayed because I have no car. I put towels on the floor in
front of the door so that nothing could seep through,'' Ms. Smith
said. Eventually she called a friend to drive her to the evacuation
center.

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick to Speak at GOP Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Kirkpatrick announcement in top 4 grafs, picking
up in 4th graf pvs, Ms. Richards</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican officials said today, one day after the Democrats
named Texan Ann Richards as their convention keynote speaker, that
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick would be ``one of the featured speakers'' at
the GOP convention in August.
   Meanwhile, George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, was traveling to California today to visit a NASA research
center and a neighborhood safety program. Democrat Michael Dukakis
was touting his Massachusetts record on housing issues before
focusing again on the search for a running mate.
   The Republicans announced the convention role for Ms.
Kirkpatrick, a favorite of conservatives, after the Democrats said
they had chosen Texas State Treasurer Richards, a fiery populist
orator, to deliver the keynote speech and ``set the tone'' for the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat, gave a widely publicized
speech attacking the Democrats at the 1984 Republican convention.
Republican Party chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said the
announcement of the keynote speaker for the New Orleans meeting
would probably come in the next ten days.
   Ms. Richards, 54, will be the second woman in party history to
deliver the convention-opening address.
   Today, in an interview on CBS-TV, she mentioned fellow Texan
Barbara Jordan's keynote speech in 1976 and added, ``That year the
Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw my selection,
having another female, as a good omen.''
   Ms. Richards said she would consult with advisers to Jesse
Jackson as well as Dukakis before preparing her speech. ``I welcome
any help and any advice that I get,'' she said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, says he is weighing which of a dozen issues
left out of the party platform to bring up at convention. His
comments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver and Washington
over the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul of
party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.
   Jackson was part of the sellout crowd of 21,785 in Atlantic
City, N.J., who watched Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks in the
first round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown.
   Dukakis will travel on Wednesday to Washington to meet with
several dozen senators, including some who have been mentioned as
possible running mates.
   Among them is Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, although he said Monday he
was not providing the Dukakis campaign with background and
financial information it has requested of prospective running mates.
   Nunn said he had told Dukakis and campaign chairman Paul
Brountas that a spot on the Democratic ticket is ``not on my
agenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for a running mate.
   Another prominent senator, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, last week
said he had informed Dukakis that he did not want to be considered.
And the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today, citing
unidentified sources, that House Majority Leader Tom Foley, who has
said frequently that he doesn't want to be vice president, had
chosen not to have Dukakis' aides examine his personal background
and finances.
   Those under consideration, according to sources, include
Jackson, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Nunn, John Glenn of Ohio, and
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Reps. Foley of Washington and Lee
Hamilton of Indiana.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
also reportedly have been asked to provide information to Brountas.
   Aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing the
choice for he second spot on the ticket.
   Jackson has continued to talk about his own qualifications as a
running mate for Dukakis. And although he says he's happy with
parts of the platform, he is indicating that some points of
disagreement will be brought up at the convention.
   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in the
platform,'' Jackson said Monday. But he noted that his forces had
``protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues in
Atlanta.''
   One of those issues might be a call for the creation of a
Palestinian homeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusion
in the platform.
   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate
anyone,'' Jackson said in Rosemont, Ill.
   In announcing the selection of Ms. Richards as the keynote
speaker for the Democrats, party chief Paul G. Kirk said she would
``set the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and... draw the
distinctions between the party of the working American people and
the party of the establishment.''
   In Texas, Ms. Richards, the divorced mother of four grown
children, said: ``I probably will be talking very much about
American families. I think that's what I know the most about, other
than my professional job.''
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Bush met Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
Washington amid more bad news in the polls.

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, in a highly
personal keynote address, told the Democratic National Convention
on Monday night that the Reagan administration had turned America's
working class into the forgotten class. ``We can do better,'' she
said.
   Ms. Richards recounted a letter from a Lorena, Texas mother of
three who said her family income of $50,000 a year makes life a
constant fiscal challenge.
   ``We're the people you see every day in the grocery store,'' Ms.
Richards said, quoting from the unidentified woman's letter. ``We
obey the laws, pay our taxes and fly our flag on holidays.
   ``We plod along, trying to make it better for ourselves and our
children and our parents. We aren't vocal anymore. I think maybe
we're too tired,'' the woman wrote. ``I believe people like us have
been forgotten in America.''
   Ms. Richards said the woman was right.
   ``Of course you believe you're forgotten. Because you have been.
This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a
puzzle that can't fit together. They've tried to put us in
compartments and separate us from each other. Their political
theory is divide and conquer,'' she said.
   ``No wonder we feel isolated, confused. We want answers and
their response is that something is wrong with you,'' Ms. Richards
added. ``Well nothing's wrong with you ... that you can't fix in
November.''
   ``When it comes right down to it, this election is a contest
between those who are satisfied with what they have _ and those who
know we can do better,'' she said. ``That's what this election is
all about.''
   Using her trademark rapier wit, she singled out Vice President
George Bush, the probable GOP presidential nominee.
   ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he is
after a job that he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbus
discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education,''
she said.
   ``Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot
in his mouth,'' Ms. Richards said.
   She received a big laugh with her opening line, when she chided
Bush's claim that he is a Texan. He claims a Houston hotel suite as
his legal residence.
   ``I am delighted to be here with you this evening because after
listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to
know what a real Texas accent sounds like,'' said the Waco, Texas
native who speaks with a sure-enough Texas drawl.
   ``I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than
100 days, the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-St
ockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-Geoge Bush-era will be over,'' she said to
sustained applause from the Democrats.
   Dukakis, who watched the speech on television, telephoned Ms.
Richards to congratulate her on ``a great speech.''
   According to press secretaqry Dayton Duncan, Dukakis told Mrs.
Richards, ``What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all.''
Dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose keynote address four years ago
propelled him to national prominence, also had high praise for Ms.
Richards' effort.
   ``I think it was like lighting a fuse for these Democrats,''
Cuomo said from the NBC anchor booth where he watched the address.
``They're ready to go.''
   Ms. Richards had high praise for Michael Dukakis, to whom she is
committed, and for runner-up Jesse Jackson.
   She said Jackson ``can open our hearts and our minds and stir
our very souls. He's taught us that we are as good as our capacity
for caring.''
   She touted Dukakis as a man ``who knows that this country is on
the edge of a great new era.
   ``Behind his calm there's an impatience to unify this country
and get on with the future,'' Ms. Richards said.
   And she praised Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' designated
running mate, as someone who ``understands America from the barrio
to the board room.''
   Ms. Richards also carried through on her promise to note the
importance of letting a woman make the keynote address. She noted
that former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, another Texan, was the
keynote speaker in 1976.
   ``Two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you
give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did
everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards in high
heels,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Ms. Richards, a 54-year-old divorced mother of four grown
children, spoke of being a grandmother, and of wanting to tell her
grand-daughter Lily ``how very lucky she is. That for all our
differences, we're still the greatest nation on this good earth.''
   ``I just hope _ like her grandparents and her great grandparents
before _ that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that
echoes in homes across America: That we can do better.''

<HEAD>Doctor Ordered To Continue Dialysis For Unwanted Patient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidney specialist has been ordered
to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the
life-giving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors.
   But a temporary restraining order issued Friday also said Jeanie
Joshua of Ojai must go elsewhere for treatment after the order
expires Friday.
   The UCLA Medical Center has accepted her for dialysis, but Ms.
Joshua said the 80-mile trip three days a week would be impossible
for her in her weakened condition.
   ``This is going to be a slow death. There's no way I can
withstand it,'' said Ms. Joshua. A friend now drives her 40 miles to
Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.
   Ms. Joshua, 38, claims kidney specialists from Santa Barbara to
Simi Valley have refused to treat her because of her 1986 lawsuit
against a Santa Barbara specialist that contends impure water was
used in the blood-purifying dialysis procedure. The suit is pending.
   Her current physician, Dr. David W. Doner Jr., told the Los
Angeles Times he was dropping Ms. Joshua because she was too
aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could
not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town.
   Ms. Joshua described herself as an assertive patient who
sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with.
   Three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern Santa
Barbara and Ventura counties have refused to see her, she said.
   Doner has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient, his
lawyer said. ``It's well-established law that a physician may select
which patients he cares for,'' said Harold M. Haider.
   The few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctor's
right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new
patient, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   But arrangements have usually been made to provide
life-sustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients, he
said.
   ``There are cases where patients have been dialyzed while
shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present,'' Caplan said.
``You can't just be abandoned in a life-and-death situation.''

<TEXT>
   Wildfires ignited by arson and
accident crackled across Southern California on Thursday after
ravaging more than 560 homes and other buildings in Santa Barbara
County and more than 90 homes elsewhere.
   A U.S. Forest Service firefighting helicopter crashed in San
Marcos Pass northwest of Santa Barbara, and the pilot broke his
leg. The aviator was taken to a hospital, said Santa Barbara County
spokesman Bill Douros.
   The National Weather Service said a return of gusts that fanned
flames Wednesday was unlikely. Hot, dry winds had fanned the
flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of brush in a four-county area
north, east and south of Los Angeles.
   Fires also burned in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Utah and Texas.
   A destructive blaze in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale was
contained after destroying or damaging 66 hillside homes Wednesday.
   No deaths were immediately reported. One person was severely
burned in Santa Barbara and three firefighters were seriously
injured in Riverside County, authorities said.
   Santa Barbara County, where rugged brush-covered hills rise
sharply from the coastline, was hit hardest. A 4,000-acre arson
fire that broke out late Wednesday near Santa Barbara and the
nearby town of Goleta was one of the worst on record here. It
continued to burn Thursday afternoon, and firefighters would offer
no estimate of when it might be contained.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said county
sheriff's department spokesman Tim Grasey.
   The fire destroyed some neighborhoods; in other cases, it leaped
over houses and left them standing improbably amid ruins.
   Desert winds up to 60 mph pushed the fire through the hills
Wednesday night, giving some residents little time to flee.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said Kay O'Brien, who
fled her home with her husband carrying only family pictures and a
retirement watch. The home and all their possessions were lost.
   ``We woke up this morning and wanted to brush our teeth, but we
didn't even have a toothbrush,'' she said.
   The toll in the Santa Barbara area was put at 567 homes and
other buildings. Bill Wallace, a county supervisor, said the homes
alone were worth $190 million, and said the damage figure could go
as high as $500 million.
   Firefighters controlled blazes in Utah and at Yellowstone
National Park in Montana, but other fires raged unchecked in
Arizona, Texas and Colorado. In Arizona, where six firefighters
died Tuesday, a lightning fire in the Tonto National Forest
destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by Western novelist Zane Grey.
   Two units of specially trained Wyoming Air National Guard
firefighters have been ordered to California to help fight the
wildfires raging out of control near Santa Barbara, said John
Cornelison of the Wyoming Adjutant General's office.
   The soldiers will travel to the West Coast in two C-130 aircraft
equipped with firefighting systems capable of dumping 3,000 gallons
of fire retardant in less than eight seconds, Cornelison said.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian toured Santa Barbara and
Glendale and declared states of emergency to release additional
state money and pave the way for federal assistance.
   Deukmejian also authorized a $50,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the arsonist.
   Fire danger loomed high throughout Southern California, where
the brush is parched by four years of drought. A heat wave entered
its third day after setting record highs over 100 degrees in many
areas.
   In Los Angeles County, a blaze in the hills above Clareont
threatened a school and 10 houses. The 50-acre blaze started in the
afternoon, and burned out of control, authorities said.
   In Glendale, residents of the hilly neighborhood struck by an
arsonist sorted through the ashes, all that was left of many
expensive homes.
   ``I guess we'll just tighten our belts and get on with life,''
said Dennie Gill, a produce wholesaler whose home was destroyed.
``It was a nice house.''
   Witnesses said they saw one of two young men in a car toss a
butane lighter into the brush off Verdugo Road, where the fire
started, said Chris Gray, a battalion chief in the Glendale Fire
Department.
   In Riverside County, a controlled burn that got out of hand when
winds unexpectedly changed bore down on the city of Corona after
destroying 12 homes and charring 2,200 acres, said Corona police
Sgt. Rick Bourgault.
   ``Some of the smoldering areas came right up to the back yards
of houses,'' said Bourgault. ``There's lots of smoke and hot spots.
Some of the hot spots whipped up into pretty good fires.''
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of San Bernardino
County blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at least 14 homes, with
hundreds more threatened, said Orange County Fire Department
spokeswoman Maria Sobal.
   The fire was 50 percent contained and firefighters worked
feverishly to beat rising winds, said California Department of
Forestry spokeswoman Sharon Sellers.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' she said.
``We're not happy about that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigaton of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   Three inmates working as firefighters were in good condition
recovering at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after suffering
first- and second-degree burns Wednesday in a 150-acre fire near
Hemet, said hospital spokeswoman Johna Rogovin.
   ``The wind shifted on them really quickly and there was nothing
they could do,'' said Riverside County Fire Department spokeswoman
Deborah Bennett.
   The fire was contained early Thursday, she said.
   In the Moreno Valley area of the county, fire destroyed three
homes and three outbuildings. Four firefighters were injured.
   In San Diego County, a fast-moving blaze erupted near Lake
Henshaw, consuming 75 acres and forcing the evacuation of a Boy
Scout camp, said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
Audrey Hagen.
   Four earlier brush fires blackened about 1,700 acres before
firefighters contained the blazes.

   Michael Dukakis told black leaders today that running mate Lloyd
Bentsen has been a civil rights advocate since ``way back when in
the 1940s,'' while a disappointed Jesse Jackson was described as
flabbergasted at the way he has been treated by the Democratic
nominee-to-be.
   Jackson convention manager Ron Brown said negotiations with the
Dukakis campaign have been halted.
   ``It is now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' Brown said in an interview in Atlanta.
   Brown said Jackson and his aides could not understand what they
felt was a deliberate Dukakis snub of Jackson, who learned from
reporters that Bentsen was the vice presidential choice.
   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''
Brown said.
   At the annual meeting of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in Washington, Dukakis sought black
support in a speech that was mostly a straight campaign talk.
   NAACP President Benjamin Hooks told Dukakis, ``You know, knowing
Jesse has been good for you.''
   And Dukakis replied, ``Yes, Ben, I learned a lot from Jesse and
I've learned a lot from you....And I'm still learning.''
   As Dukakis and Bentsen wrestled with how to unify the party in
advance of nest week's convention in Atlanta, most Democrats sang a
chorus of praise for the 67-year-old Texas senator after his formal
introduction as Dukakis' running mate at Boston's Faneuil Hall.
Hopeful refrains citing the parallels with the 1960 Kennedy-Johnson
ticket were heard again and again.
   ``He's a terrific guy. He's very tough, very smart,'' Oregon
Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said of Bentsen.
   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the 1984 Democratic
presidential nominee, said Bentsen ``has been a source of good
sense, moderation and decency throughout his years of public life.''
   ``He knows how to beat George Bush,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. ``He did just that in 1970'' _ when Bentsen
defeated Bush for the first of three terms in the Senate.
   Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be, called Dukakis' choice of
the Senate Finance Committee chairman ``interesting'' but refused
to say more.
   Bush's supporters were quick to argue that Democrats still won't
carry the state Bush calls home _ and its 29 electoral votes _ in
the November balloting.
   ``He is desperate. He knows he can't win without carrying
Texas,'' Texas Gov. Bill Clements said of Dukakis. ``It ain't going
to work.''
   But the Jackson problem loomed as the major stumbling block
between Dukakis and seamlessly positive four days in Atlanta.
   At the NAACP, Dukakis referred to Bentsen's long committment to
civil rights.
   ``He was committed to civil rights and equal opportunities way
back then, way back then in the 1940s,'' Dukakis said.
   Bentsen then addressed the meeting, with an admonition from
Hooks.
   ``You may as well know you've got a hard act today, so do your
best,'' Hooks said. ``Many of our delegates wanted to see Jesse in
this position.''
   Former party chief and Jackson adviser John White echoed those
sentiments about his fellow Texan: ``He's got one of the best civil
rights records in the Senate. He voted against the poll tax when he
was in the Congress back in the '50s.''
   It was clear that the Democratic ticket needed to calm some
angry Jackson backers.
   ``I did think he was very rude not to let Jesse know
beforehand,'' said Beulah C. Wright of Main Line, Pa., a NAACP
delegate.
   ``I frankly think he's made life a lot more difficult for
himself and will have to work a lot harder,'' said Rep. Ron
Dellums, a Jackson supporter from California.
   Jackson spoke to NAACP Tuesday night, delivering an emotional
speech that drew cheers from the overflow crowd.
   ``I may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's what I
know! Qualified!'' Jackson shouted. ``I will never surrender.''
   The civil rights leader promised that he would press his stands
on the issues at the convention that opens Monday.
   ``We go to Atlanta not to smile and style and profile, but to
deliberate and debate our nation's priorities,'' Jackson said.
   Ann Lewis, a top Jackson adviser, said today that the
presidential hopeful will strike a positive tone at the convention.
   ``You're going to see a Jesse Jackson who is forward looking,
who's talking about the fall, who's talking about the issues,'' she
said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Earlier Tuesday, at a news conference, Jackson insisted he was
not angry at the Dukakis decision.
   ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be
angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive,'' he said.
   Earlier, Jackson had clearly been upset that he learned of
Dukakis' choice from reporters rather than from the Massachusetts
governor directly.
   Bush spoke to the NAACP ahead of all the Democrats, addressing
them early on Tuesday. He didn't mention Bentsen, but he did praise
Jackson.
   ``I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he
deserves a salute from us,'' the vice president said.
   Late Tuesday, on the way to baseball's All-Star game in
Cincinnati, Bush had only a brief remark on the choice of Bentsen:
``That's interesting. That's what I think about it.''
   Dukakis often compares himself to the last president from
Massachusetts _ John F. Kennedy _ and invited more comparisons of
his decision for Bentsen with Kennedy's selection of Texas Sen.
Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960.
   Bentsen put it this way: ``The Massachusetts and the Texas axis
was good for the country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960
and it's going to be a real winner in November of '88.''
   ``There's something lucky about a Massachusetts-Texas
connection,'' said North Carolina Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan.
   ``The Boston-Austin axis is reborn,'' applauded Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, a former contender for the Democratic
nomination.
   ``He will help the ticket in the south and all over the
country,'' added Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, another former
hopeful for both the presidential and vice presidential nominations.
   Another former hopeful, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, said,
``When the American people get to know Lloyd Bentsen, it will
strengthen the ticket everywhere.''
   The preparations for Monday's opening session in Atlanta
intensified as construction work in the convention hall was wrapped
up. The trickle of delegates, party pros and news people arriving
in the city turned to a steady flow.
   Polls in Texas said Bentsen would help Dukakis there, but
nationally the polls said the voters knew little of the Texan.
   ``It's like dropping a rock in a pond and having no ripples. ...
They're both unknowns'' to Californians, said Golden State pollster
Mervin Field.

<HEAD>Democrats Select Texan Ann Richards To Deliver Keynote Address</HEAD>

   Ann Richards, fiery populist and Texas state
treasurer, was chosen Monday to deliver the keynote speech and
``set the tone'' for the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
next month.
   Party chief Paul G. Kirk said Ms. Richards ``has the ability to
tell it like it is'' as he announced that the 54-year-old will be
the second woman in party history to take the podium to deliver the
opening address of the meeting. She is the first woman to hold
statewide office in Texas in half a century.
   Kirk said the Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis was
consulted on the choice and was interested in having a woman to
step to the podium on July 18.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' Kirk said, ``not only because of the importance of the
family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that women are
going through in the daily work lives and family lives, but I think
it is symbolic of the importance of women to the American family
and the realities of all of that.
   ``And the fact that, let's face it, that is a strength of the
Democratic Party and a weakness of George Bush and the
Republicans.''
   Ms. Richards, who held a news conference in Austin, Texas,
shortly after Kirk's announcement, said American families are
``what I know the most about, other than my professional job.''
   Known for her sparkling rhetoric, Ms. Richards said she honed
her speaking ability on the soap boxes of small-town Texas.
   ``For about the past 10 years I've been making speeches at the
Madisonville Cattleman's Association and the McAllen
Mexican-American Democrats convention and the Nacogdoches Chamber
of Commerce and in any number of places that you think of,'' Ms.
Richards said. ``It's sort of like, `How do you get to Carnegie
Hall?' You just practice.'''
   Ms. Richards, who plans to seek the Texas governorship in 1990,
emerged over the weekend as the likely choice for the keynote job,
which offers a national audience to impress or disappoint. The only
other woman ever to have the role was former Rep. Barbara Jordan,
also of Texas, who shared the job with Sen. John Glenn of Ohio.
   Kirk said he was happy to announce that Ms. Richards would ``set
the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and to draw the distinctions
between the party of the working American people and the party of
the establishment. Ann Richards is a mainstream Democrat and a
fiery populist from Texas, one of George Bush's adopted states.''
   ``She has the ability to tell it like it is and speak in the
language ... working Americans can understand and relate to,'' he
added.
   Kirk was asked if the selection of another Texan for a prominent
role at the Atlanta meeting July 18-21 was indicative of the
importance of the state in the fall. House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas is the convention chairman.
   ``In fact, when you look at the Electoral College map, you can't
do enough for Texas,'' Kirk said.
   Kirk defended Wright's role as chairman of the convention,
despite the investigations focusing on charges of unethical
behavior against the House speaker.
   ``There is no hesitancy on my part or on the part of the
Democratic Party about Speaker Wright's role at the convention,''
Kirk said.
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Kirk said in answer to a question that he would be glad to serve
as Democratic National Committee chairman through the general
election, even though his term expires right after the convention.
But after the election, ``That will be that.''
   Ms. Richards was born on Sept. 1, 1933, outside of Waco, Texas.
A graduate of Baylor University, she was first elected to office as
a member of the Travis County Commissioner's Court in 1976. In
1982, she was elected state treasurer, the first woman to hold
statewide office there in over 50 years.
   She is a divorced mother of four grown children.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Baird under fire at Senate hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned that she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White
House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has
declared he will vote against confirmation.
But Mr Hatch also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily
against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in
the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor
known for her high principles.
'The ethical high ground for Zoe Baird is to request that her name be
withdrawn,' Ms Jordan said. Earlier this week, Ms Patricia King, also black
and a Georgetown University law professor, had maintained in a powerful
Washington Post column that the nation's chief law enforcement officer could
not be someone who had recently broken the law.
Elsewhere, the new administration, if not the president himself, began to
get down to work. Mr Clinton was preoccupied with welcoming 2,500 guests to
a White House open day. But Mr Warren Christopher, confirmed on Wednesday as
secretary of state, talked to Mr Nelson Mandela of the African National
Congress.

<TEXT>
   Surgeons completed a rare double-lung
transplant operation on U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence of South Carolina
early today, officials at the University of Mississippi Medical
Center said.
   Spence, 60, was in critical but stable condition following the
5-hour surgery, which ended at 3 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Barbara Austin.
   Spence, suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease, flew to
Mississippi Friday afternoon from Columbia, S.C., after being
notified of a possible set of donor lungs in Texas.
   ``The transplant team said the surgery proceeded as
anticipated,'' Austin said. ``He'll remain in the hospital probably
four or five weeks to recuperate.''
   Members of the transplant team flew to Texas Friday afternoon
and returned late Friday night with the organs after determining
the lungs were in good enough shape to transplant, hospital
spokeswoman Janice Quinn said.
   Surgeons opened Spence's chest about an hour before the lungs
arrived at about 10:45 p.m., hospital officials said.
   Spence appeared alert and in good spirits as he was wheeled into
the hospital. The legislator's son, David Spence, said the family
was confident about the outcome of the operation.
   ``The surgeons are very optimistic about the condition of the
donor's lungs, with Floyd's physical condition and with his
tolerance to the operation,'' said Randy Mashburn, Spence's
district administrator. ``They are very upbeat.''
   At one point last October, Spence was put under intensive care
at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland in critical condition.
Afterward, the congressman went on the list of potential organ
transplant recipients.
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 12 times in North America _ three times at Jackson and
nine times at Toronto General Hospital under the auspices of the
Toronto University School of Medicine.
   Eight of the Toronto patients are still living, but only one of
the three from Jackson remains alive. University Medical Center
officials attributed one of the two deaths to factors unrelated to
either the surgery or respiratory ailments that led to the
operations.
   Dr. Sesshadri Raju, professor of surgery and director of the
transplant program at Jackson, said last month that with a normal
recovery, Spence would be able to resume a normal schedule after
six months with ``surprisingly'' few physical restrictions.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, Spence has made few public appearances since his October
hospitalization.
   However, he has filed for re-election. The nine-term Republican
will face Democrat Jim Leventis in the November election.

<SO> </SO>
<G> JUS CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   Amid the stories about the two resigned Justice Department officials yesterday, the Washington Post had another story: "Independent Counsel Subpoenas Ursula Meese's Job Records." 
It now develops that Independent Counsel James McKay is investigating Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
"According to sources familiar with McKay's inquiry, the independent counsel has been trying to determine whether the Meeses' close friend, E. Bob Wallach, in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Ursula Meese for the jobs." 
Mrs. Meese's job is matching MS patients with employers. 

   Whatever is going on here, the one thing we may fairly conclude is that it is worthy of investigation. But if it merits the attention of special prosecutors and reporters, then the town may hold enough such stories to command the attention of many such investigations. Last December, a UPI reporter produced a long story listing 73 relatives of House and Senate members who have worked for Congress in paid jobs since mid-1986. By law, members may not hire their own relatives, but the law says nothing about them working for other Members or for Congress itself. Here is a partial state-by-state summary, current at the time of UPI's story:
   American Samoa: Fiti Sunia, son of Delegate Fofo Sunia, works in the office of California Rep. Mervyn Dymally. 
"It's hard to get a position if you come in right off the street," says Fiti Sunia. 
Vaaomala Sunia, another of Fofo Sunia's sons, works as a Capitol Hill policeman. 

   Arizona: Vincent Fabrizio, stepson of Rep. Morris Udall is a staff member for the House Public Works Committee, chaired until last week by the late Rep. James Howard. 
Rep. Howard's daughter works on the Interior Committee chaired by Rep. Udall. 

   California: Edith Wilkie, wife of Rep. Don Edwards, works as executive director of the Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus. 
She worked for Congress before her husband's election. 

   Arlene Willis, wife of Rep. Jerry Lewis, works as his administrative assistant. 
While she worked for him before their marriage, their current relationship was not listed, as is required, on monthly payroll records. 

   Phyllis Coelho, wife of Rep. Tony Coelho, is a secretary in Indiana Rep. Andy Jacobs' office, where she worked before her marriage. 

   Douglas Boxer, son of Rep. Barbara Boxer of California, worked last summer for the House Ways and Means committee. 
His sister, Nicole, worked the previous summer for Rep. Les AuCoin. 

   Colorado: Janna Hefley, daughter of Rep. Joel Hefley, worked as a paid intern for Rep. James Bunning of Kentucky. 

   Connecticut: John Kennelly, son of Rep. Barbara Kennelly, worked last summer as a clerk for the House postmaster. 

   District of Columbia: John Ball, a brother-in-law of Delegate Walter Fauntroy, works in the House doorkeeper's office. 

   Florida: Daniel Barton, cousin of Rep. William Lehman, worked last summer as a page for the House doorkeeper. 

   Mary McGillicuddy, sister of Rep. Connie Mack, worked until last year for Rep. Barbara Vucanovich. 

   Hawaii: Andrew Matsunaga, brother of Sen. Spark Matsunaga, works as director of the Senator's Honolulu office. 
He began work before current anti-nepotism laws were passed. 
Also, Senator Matsunaga's son-in-law is a Capitol Hill police officer. 

   Idaho: Sallianne Stallings, daughter of Rep. Richard Stallings, worked as a summer clerk for the House postmaster. 

   Illinois: Doyle Evans, brother of Rep. Lane Evans, works in the House doorkeeper's office. 

   Herman Morris, nephew of Rep. Cardiss Collins, worked last summer as a clerk for the House doorkeeper. 

   Rose Marie Lipinski, wife of Rep. William Lipinski, works part time for the House Administration Committee. 

   Heather Davis, daughter of Rep. Jack Davis, worked as a paid intern last summer for Rep. Jim Bunning of Kentucky. 

   Phillip Miller, stepson of Rep. Charles Hayes, works for the House postmaster. 

   Kansas: Rhoda Glickman, wife of Rep. Dan Glickman, works as executive director of the Congressional Arts Caucus.

   Barbara Bush won senior citizens' hearts
and charmed guests at fund-raisers for a Republican congresswoman in
a whirlwind visit to Rhode Island.
   Mrs. Bush arrived at T.F. Green State Airport around 11:30 a.m.,
attended two fund-raisers at a hotel for Rep. Claudine Schneider,
visited a senior citizens center in suburban Cranston and left
shortly after 2 p.m.
   About 30 people waited outside the Omni Biltmore hotel for a
glimpse of the popular first lady, but the Secret Service forced
them out from under an awning and into the rain to make room for her
entourage.
   Mrs. Bush told about 700 people who paid $150 to $1,000 apiece to
attend the fund raisers about her husband's programs and her
campaign for literacy, but didn't mention the campaign Miss
Schneider is contemplating against Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., next
year.
   Asked about the potential Pell-Schneider contest at a hotel news
conference, Mrs. Bush initially ducked the issue. ``I like her just
where she is today,'' the first lady said.
   A few minutes later, she said, ``Claudine Schneider is qualified
for anything. ... I'm just not going to fool around in the internal
politics of Rhode Island. She can be anything.''
   The 42-year-old congresswoman was first elected to Congress in
1980, and has built a reputation as an environmental advocate. She
has yet to declare her plans for 1990.
   The fund raisers raised about $170,000, said Schneider
spokeswoman Bob Rendine.
   At the Cranston Senior Services center, about two dozen
schoolchildren and a handful of adults awaited Mrs. Bush, but the
most they got was a glimpse of her red suit and trademark triple
strand of fake pearls.
   Her folksy, down-to-earth personality, though, won rave reviews
from senior citizens.
   ``There's no airs about her. I think she's great,'' Rose Cirelli
of Cranston said as she watched Mrs. Bush join about 20 people
dancing to the tune, ``New York, New York.''
   Mrs. Bush was less successful as she took several shots with a
pool cue in the center's pool room.
   ``Do I have to call a ball?'' she asked.
   ``No, you have executive privilege,'' a player replied.
   After missing an easy shot, Mrs. Bush turned and said, ``You
ought to see me on the tennis court.''

   Sen. Phil Gramm said Wednesday he will offer
the nation a glimpse of George Bush's ``vision of America'' when he
gives the nominating speech for Bush at the Republican National
Convention.
   Gramm is the latest Texan to come to the fore as both parties
battle for the Lone Star State's 29 electoral votes in the November
election.
   The state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, is the Democratic
nominee for vice president; Bush is an adopted Texan who calls
Houston home, and at the Democratic National Convention, Texas
state Treasurer Ann Richards gave the keynote address, Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower spoke during prime time, and former Rep.
Barbara Jordan seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``It is a great opportunity for me to talk about the vice
president, about his service to America, which ranges over almost
half a century _ from his days as a naval pilot flying off the
(USS) San Jacinto to being the greatest vice president we've ever
had,'' said the junior senator from Texas.
   In his speech in two weeks in New Orleans, he said, he plans to
``really remind people what the world was like that cold day in
January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office
... their proud record and what they've achieved.''
   He will contrast those accomplishments to the record of
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, he indicated.
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   He was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said Wednesday.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity.''
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.

   Sen. Phil Gramm said today he will give the
nominating speech for George Bush at the Republican National
Convention, underscoring the importance of Texas in the November
election.
   Gramm said he would talk about what the country and world were
like ``that cold day in January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush
took the oath of office, their proud record and what they've
achieved.''
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   The junior senator from Texas said he would also compare the
record of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis with Bush
and would speak of the vice president's ``lifetime of service,
Bush's vision of America.''
   Texans also played key roles in the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta last month, with state Treasurer Ann Richards
giving the keynote address and former Rep. Barbara Jordan seconding
the nomination of the state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, for
vice president.
   Gramm was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said today.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity. I believe in George Bush. I believe he's the
greatest vice president we've ever had.
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention and missed Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton's lengthy nominating speech for Dukakis.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he has no doubt the Republicans will carry Texas with
its 29 electoral votes.
   His fellow Texas senator would not agree, he said, ``but he has
a vested interest and I don't.''

   The second of five children wounded in a
school shooting rampage by a babysitter was released from the
hospital Friday, as authorities continued their investigation into
the assailant's background.
   No new information has emerged in the probe of 30-year-old
Laurie Dann, who fatally shot herself after killing one youngster
and injuring six other people May 20 in this wealthy Chicago
suburb, said Police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis.
   Toxicology reports have turned up no evidence of drugs in her
system, but complete findings will not be available until the end
of next week, said Cook County Medical Examiner Dr. Robert Stein.
   Six-year-old Robert Trossman, who was shot in the chest by Ms.
Dann in a bathroom at Hubbard Woods School, was released Friday
morning from Evanston Hospital, said spokeswoman Barbara Traeger.
   The child most critically injured when Ms. Dann opened fire in a
classroom, 8-year-old Lindsay Fisher, was upgraded from fair to
good condition a day after being to a regular pediatric ward, Ms.
Traeger said.
   The first shooting victim to be released from the hospital went
home Thursday.
   One other injured youngster at Evanston Hospital was in good
condtion, while the two other people who were injured were reported
in fair condition at Highland Park Hospital, said a spokeswoman
there, Sue Masarrachia.
   No information was released Friday about a friend of Ms. Dann's
who was arrested Thursday for allegedly making threatening
telephone calls similar to those Ms. Dann made in the weeks before
the shooting spree.
   Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of Highland Park, was committed
involuntarily Thursday to psychiatric treatment at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, but spokeswoman Debbie
Jenkins said no update would be made until next week.
   Documents filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court showed Ms.
Taylor had signed for voluntary admission to the hospital's
psychiatric unit, agreeing to stay if necessary up to 30 days, when
she will be reevaluated.
   Police said Ms. Taylor was taken into custody late Wednesday at
the Highwood convenience store where she worked. Ms. Taylor later
surrendered a .357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where
she lived.
   The FBI in Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann had been living, has
said she apparently acted alone in obtaining poison she used to
lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she sent or
delivered to acquaintances before last week's shooting spree.
   No one was seriously sickened.

   At least two bystanders failed to help two
toddlers found floating face down in an apartment swimming pool, and
a fire department official said he was baffled by their inaction.
   ``Anybody in their right mind _ you'd think they would, but they
didn't,'' said Capt. C.A. Beasley.
   Beasley said two men stood by while Taffidie McGough, 2, and her
15-month-old half-sister, Tiffidie Anne, were rescued from the pool.
   Tiffidie Anne was found floating face down in the shallow end of
the pool and was declared dead at the scene.
   Taffidie was on the bottom of the pool near her sister. She
didn't show a pulse but was revived en route to the hospital,
officials said. She remains in critical condition and on life
support systems at Texas Children's Hospital, spokeswoman Tina
Foster said.
   One man told Beasley there appeared to be ``dolls or dogs'' in
the pool.
   ``Regardless of what they thought they were,'' Beasley said. ``I
can't imagine anybody standing there looking at two kids in the
pool. They would be better off out of the pool no matter what.''
   District Attorney John B. Holmes said there are no criminal
sanctions for failing to rescue the children.
   ``But common sense suggests that no caring, thinking human being
would stand handily by while two kids were drowning,'' he said.
   The girls apparently left their apartment Sunday morning while
their mother slept and wandered into the pool.
   The girls' mother, Tammie Patterson, 20, said she learned her
children had fallen into the pool when an unidentified man knocked
on her door.
   ``I don't understand why they didn't'' try to save the children,
said Ms. Patterson.
   ``It's too late,'' she said. ``I've got one baby that's dead and
one baby who's fighting for her life.''

'SICKIE' MARCIKIC IS HOLDING THE ATTENTION OF MASTERS SWIMMERS IN PROGRAM AT 
UCSD

Motivation by curiousity. It's not a concept widely used by coaches training 
athletes with visions of either national recognition or Olympic fame. 
</P>
<P>
But for one "Sickie," it's working. 
</P>
<P>
Ron (Sickie) Marcikic is the man, sometimes clown, behind the UCSD Masters 
swimming program. 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic has the task of holding the interest of 325 participants, swimmers who 
otherwise might stay away. To do so, Marcikic calls on his imagination to 
motivate. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear a lot of weird clothes," said Marcikic, 39. "A lot of times our 
swimmers will show up just because they want to see what I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic's odd outfits include bright shorts, mismatched shoes and funny hats. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's program is the largest of 24 regional San Diego/Imperial Swim Masters 
clubs, all of which are governed by United States Masters Swimming. The La 
Jolla Jewish Community Center and Carlsbad Masters have 115 swimmers each, an 
Allied Gardens club called "Different Strokes" has 80 and Coronado has 50 
members. 
</P>
<P>
There are 1,300 masters swimmers in San Diego, making it the third largest 
region in the country and in California, the state with the most clubs and 
members. Northern California is first with 6,557 swimmers, and the Los 
Angeles/Orange County/Santa Barbara region is second with 2,356 members. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these swimmers are like Larry Hill, 50, a computer programmer for the 
San Diego Unified School District. He returned to swimming in Marcikic's 
program eight years ago after a layoff of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sickie provides a lot of variety," he said. "If I don't come, I feel like I'm 
missing out. I'm a better swimmer now than I was in high school and college." 
</P>
<P>
Camille Thompson, a member of the U.S. 1976 Olympic swim team in Montreal, has 
been with the program for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches are great," she said. "Sickie makes it fun. He does crazy things. 
There's always something going on to keep people interested." 
</P>
<P>
In a sport in which it becomes increasingly tiresome to stare at a painted line 
at the bottom of the pool, lap after lap, Marcikic dreams up wild workouts to 
arouse interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I make up strange sets for them," he said. "I'll make them swim on their 
backs, feet first, going backwards, all sorts of different things. You treat 
them like kids but are able to talk to them like adults. The bottom line here 
is fun." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic also has staged some unconventional dry-land activities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he staged such a bizarre golf tournament -- players were required to 
hit the ball with a baseball bat on one hole and with a pool cue on another -- 
that the group was told not to come back to the course. And this summer, the 
group will hold its first bowling tournament, at an unsuspecting alley to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
But to portray the program as a pool of games is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Of the athletes enrolled in UCSD's program, Marcikic said approximately half 
are serious triathletes or swimmers in training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a well-organized workout," Marcikic said. "And it's not easy. 
When you're training as many as 80 to 100 people in the water in one workout, 
you don't want to hurt the people who are serious. But you don't want to burn 
out the ones who are there for fun either." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Marcikic hired Jeff Milton four years ago to work with more serious 
swimmers such as triathletes Scott Tinley, Mark Allen and Julie Moss and 
multiple masters world-record holders Barbara Dunbar and Betsy Jordan. Milton, 
33, also is swimming coach at University City High School. 
</P>
<P>
The less-serious participants swim to stay in shape, to feel good about 
themselves and to escape, for 1 1/2 hours a day, the grind of high-stress jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Milton said: "They love to be told what to do. They have to be told to get off 
the wall just like high school kids. And they have to do a 50 butterfly on 
their birthday no matter who they are." 
</P>
<P>
In a pool, a doctor and a doorman are indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of professors, doctors, lawyers, many well-respected people 
in the community," Marcikic said. "But once they're on deck, in their Speedos, 
you don't recognize them. They're just as crazy as anyone, and they're looking 
for the same results. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Belshin, 29, is a former competitive swimmer turned retail developer 
for Trammell Crow Company. Belshin said he relies on swimming to keep his 
sanity, and he likes the absence of a hierarchy in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what a lot of the people do," he said. "In the pool, 
everyone's the same. This is a time to escape work. People don't talk about it 
much." 
</P>
<P>
County Superior Court Judge Tony Joseph, 52, has been swimming under Marcikic 
for two years. In a masters meet in La Jolla in April, he won the men's 50-54 
500-yard freestyle. He says swimming is a great way to escape the pressures of 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have something you do that is completely separate from law," 
Joseph said. "It's easier to stay awake all day if you start out doing this." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great program," said Thompson, 34, a silver-medalist in the 
400-meter medley relay in Montreal. "It's a good melting pot here, and you get 
the hours you need." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon View Pool is open for UCSD's masters swimming at 6 a.m. Marcikic and 
Milton divide the pool for two different workouts from 6-7:30. UCSD is also 
open for workouts from 7:30-9 a.m., noon-1:30 p.m. and 6:30-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In masters swimming, the training is much less intense then when Thompson and 
Charlie Campbell, a first-year UCSD member and 1972 Olympian, were swimming 
four to six hours a day training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
After a 15-year break from the sport, Campbell -- a member of the 400 medley 
relay team that set a world record in 1971 -- has returned to swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming was a way of life for me," he said. "When you're a kid, you're a 
semi-pro. Now, this is a chance to get a good workout. We do less distance then 
when I was a kid. This is a program that's sophisticated and low-key. They give 
you whatever you can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: "It's not like the old days. You can get out when you want. I 
swim with Jeff, and he's a great motivator. He knows where to draw the line." 
</P>
<P>
Milton said family and job commitments force the shorter workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We can make it just as tough, but not as long," he said. "They don't have the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic and Milton, who have both coached youngsters, enjoy the built-in 
discipline of the adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to coach adults," Marcikic said. "We're not just coaches to them, 
we're friends. It's not a customer/client relationship. Swimming isn't their 
whole lives. I have to build that into their workout because they won't always 
be able to be here." 
</P>
<P>
According to USMS Executive Director Dorothy Donnelly, there are 24,000 
registered members swimming on 435 clubs across the country. There are more men 
than women registered nationally, but UCSD's male-female ratio is fairly even. 
</P>
<P>
Locally and nationally, for both men and women, the most popular age group is 
25-35. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Masters swimmers competed in age groups that were divided into 
10-year increments, beginning at 25 and stopping at 65-plus. Now there are 
five-year increments. The youngest group is 19-24, the oldest 95-up. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two men competing in the highest age group. UCSD's Tom Lane is 
one of them. He holds nine national and four world records in the 90-94 
division, despite the fact he is blind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty frail," Marcikic said. "He can only swim in warm water, but he 
does the best he can." Lane turned 95 on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers actually look forward to the birthdays that will move them up an age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait to move up and get away from the youngsters," said Dunbar, 
president of San Diego/Imperial Swim Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar, 40, holds of 18 national and 12 world records in the 40-44 age group.

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas seconding the nomination of
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for vice president at the Democratic
National Convention on Thursday night.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
   Thank you. That is quite a greeting.
   We engaged in an important task at a very important time. We are
positioning ourselves for the last decade of the twentieth century.
   Our minds are turning away from, Hooray for Hollywood. And our
minds _ and we are now confronting the hard reality of a nation
which desires to become solvent again.
   Competitive again. A nation which desires to have the trust of
its allies and its compatriots. We want _ we want to retake the
moral high ground. Now, to be what we want to be, to become the
people we want to become, we have to be moved to action by what is
reasonable, sensible, logical and rational.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a sensible, logical and rational choice for
vice president of the United States.
   You know, the people who founded America were very smart. Those
founders warned us not to become overcome by factions, but to rely
on reason as our guide. If we rely on reason as our guide, reason
will temper and tender our emotions.
   Reason will help us to do the right things. Reason will tutor us
toward doing the right things.
   I say that Lloyd Bentsen is a rational and sensible and
reasonable choice.
   Why?
   First of all, he's my senator. And I wasn't planning to come to
this convention for any purpose. But when Lloyd Bentsen was tapped
by Michael Dukakis as his choice for vice president of the United
States, I knew that if Lloyd Bentsen wanted me to come and second
his nomination, I could not resist doing that, and I'm here to do
it tonight.
   You know, Lloyd Bentsen has been in the United States Senate for
almost eighteen years. Lloyd Bentsen is a man who has an instinct
for doing what is right. Lloyd Bentsen does not have to be
pressured and lobbied to do the right thing.
   Now, Robert Bork _ Lloyd Bentsen voted no on that nomination.
And do you know what: Lloyd Bentsen didn't have to be pressured
into voting no for Bork.
   He said _ Lloyd Bentsen: ``Bork will put our civil rights and
our civil liberties at risk, and we cannot afford to do that, and
that's why I vote no.''
   You heard then Rostenkowski tell you about Bentsen's service on
the Finance Committee and now as chairman on the Finance Committee.
Do you realize that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over
practically everything that affects our lives, the lives of each
and every one of us.
   Lloyd Bentsen is patient and he managed legislation, the trade
legislation involving 24 committees of the House and the Senate,
meeting over eight months, Lloyd Bentsen was patient and moved it
through. Now, the president vetoed it, but Lloyd Bentsen got the
momentum for trade legislation going, and that momentum will not
dissipate lightly.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Keeps Own Counsel on Abortion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush said Tuesday she is keeping
silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy
``whichever way I go,'' and detract from her work on illiteracy,
the homeless, hunger and AIDS.
   ``I think that should be left to the people who are courageous
enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do
something about it,'' she told three reporters at a White House
reception for disabled award winners.
   Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections _ notably
the governor's races Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia _ she said
that she is not a ``single-issue'' person and indicated voters
should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter.
   ``I think people ought to be thinking about fiscal
responsibility and past records and ... looking at the man as a
whole or the woman as a whole,'' she said. ``I'm not a single issue
man or woman,'' she said.
   President Bush told a news conference Tuesday that he believes
Americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion. He recently
vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be
spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest.
   Asked why she will not give her own position on abortion, which
has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the
Supreme Court's July decision giving states greater leeway to
restrict it, Mrs. Bush said: ``It does nothing but cause
controversy whichever way I go. I want people to be interested in
my projects,'' such as working for literacy and the homeless.
   Mrs. Bush announced in February that she would not speak out on
controversial policy issues, after she told a reporter that she
favored a ban on semi-automatic weapons, putting her in conflict
with her husband's public position.
   The first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to
teen-age women, and says, ``We need a lot of education, to tell
these girls that there are opportunities out there for them, that
the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies. It's very
old fashioned, I know.''
   After the Supreme Court in July gave states expanded powers to
restrict abortion, Bush lauded the ruling and Mrs. Bush said only,
``I go with my president.''
   Mrs. Bush also said that she would like to go to the
Mediterranean superpower summit next month if Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, also goes.
   She said it had not been decided if she would go, but that ``I'm
one who loves to travel.''
   On another issue, Mrs. Bush said her eyes are still irritated
from the thyroid condition she suffers known as Graves Disease.
   She said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the
ailment, prednisone, has made her gain back some of the weight she
lost earlier in the year.
   ``I'm fighting a small problem, weight,'' she conceded, adding
that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape.
   Then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at
an event designed to honor people who have overcome major
disabilities.
   ``Of all the places in America to complain about taking
prednisone, this is not the party to complain about it,'' she said
as she stood among several wheelchair-bound award recipients.
   The 1989 Victory Awards were bestowed by the National
Rehabilitation Hospital to people who overcame physical obstacles
while making contributions to society.
   Among the award recipients were one chosen by the governor of
each state, and several selected by the National Rehabilitation
Hospital, a private 160-bed institution in Washington.
   This year's recipients included: country singer Barbara
Mandrell, who suffered a near fatal car accident in 1984; Latin
singer Julio Iglesias who recovered from spinal-chord paralysis
after a car accident at age 20; Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who
lost his right arm during World War II; Joni Eareckson Tada, an
internationally recognized artist who is paralyzed from the
shoulders down from a diving accident and draws with a pencil held
in her teeth; Skip Wilkins, a wheelchair-bound athlete who works as
a counselor to troubled teen-agers and and Bill Demby, a disabled
track and field athlete and professional counselor who lost both
legs in the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Rat Startled Mrs. Bush; President `Drowned the Beast'</HEAD>

   Barbara Bush says an enormous rat swam by her in
the White House pool recently but President Bush came to her rescue
and ``drowned the beast.''
   The rat she encountered in the incident several months ago ``did
not look like a Walt Disney friend, I'll tell you that,'' she said
in an interview published by newspapers in Houston and San Antonio
on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Bush, who was back in Texas for the economic summit, said
her husband came to her aid at the outdoor pool.
   ``I swim with a mask, so as it went right by in front of me _ I
mean, it was enormous,'' said Mrs. Bush, a mile-a-day swimmer.
``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned the beast. It was
horrible.''
   The White House grounds attract rats, she said, ``because we're
surrounded by parks and people drop food.''
   Or, she theorized it was an effort to get rid of the rodents
that may have led this one to find its way into the White House
pool.
   ``They put some stuff out that only bothered rats, and what it
did is make them very, very thirsty. And this rat went for the
biggest water it saw,'' she explained.
   She also credited her English springer spaniel Millie with
helping reduce the local rat population.
   For a long time afterward, she said, she insisted that her
guards check to make sure there wasn't a rat ``in hiding'' before
she entered the pool.
   On another subject, she said her husband was ``absolutely
exhausted'' when he got to Houston Friday night from the NATO
summit in London. But she added that they have both been delighted
by the warm reception Houstonians have given their international
guests.
   After viewing the friendly crowds along a motorcade route to
Rice University, ``I told George that this is the first time I've
gone that far in a car back and forth where everybody waved and no
unfriendly gestures,'' she said.
   She said Houston's heat was not too much for the summit spouses.
   ``All of these ladies have been in hot places before,'' she
said. ``I've been to Malaysia on state trips and you just learn to
glow in public. ... How much are they outdoors? Nothing. Twenty
minutes at the most.''
   Mrs. Bush took several of the spouses to San Antonio on Tuesday
for a tour of the Alamo and other sights.
   The White House released a full transcript of Mrs. Bush's
interview Monday by the Houston Chronicle, the Houston Post, the
San Antonio Light and the San Antonio Express News.

FIREFIGHTERS STRETCHED TO COVER THE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: ALTHOUGH CREWS HAVE BEEN SENT TO BATTLE THE SANTA BARBARA BLAZE, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At least 100 Ventura County firefighters have been dispatched to help battle 
the disastrous Santa Barbara fire, but officials said they have managed to 
maintain comprehensive fire protection throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that we get everybody we possibly can to cover the local 
stations," said Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. "We don't 
leave any part of the county uncovered, ever." 
</P>
<P>
By bringing virtually every firefighter on duty, the county Fire Department has 
maintained crews of at least one fire engine and three firefighters per truck 
at each of the county's 32 stations, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, firefighters with local city departments and other agencies are on 
standby to help if needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On normal days, about 130 county firefighters, or nearly one-third of the 
385-member force, are on duty at any one time, officials said. Typically, 
county firefighters work three 24-hour shifts every nine days. 
</P>
<P>
But when emergencies occur, county firefighters join with city fire departments 
to activate a backup network to maintain the same number of engines and 
firefighters to cover local neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Such an emergency was called when county firefighters, already stretched thin 
by the brush fire in Ojai, were dispatched to Santa Barbara Wednesday 
afternoon. As of Thursday, 100 firefighters remained in Santa Barbara -- about 
one-quarter of the county force. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, about 200 county firefighters helped crews from the U.S. Forest 
Service, California Department of Forestry and Los Angeles County Fire 
Department fight the brush fire that consumed 585 acres near Ojai. As of 
Thursday, only seven county workers remained as part of the firefighting force 
in the Ojai hills. 
</P>
<P>
When emergencies occur, the county Fire Department dips into the mutual aid 
system. Under this plan, participating fire agencies make firefighters and 
equipment available to neighboring communities, call in off-duty officers to 
work at local stations, and often require firefighters and other employees to 
work overtime to maintain a full level of service. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stretched in the sense that we would have to bring in other outside 
agencies if we were to have another major fire in the county now," said 
dispatcher Lisa Hines. "But as for normal, everyday emergencies, we're fully 
covered." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, fire departments from the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Santa 
Paula and a volunteer contingent from Fillmore are assisting the county Fire 
Department in covering the county surrounding their areas. A six-member 
firefighting unit at Camarillo State Hospital is also available to help out. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Tejada, assistant to the executive director at Camarillo State Hospital, 
said the hospital's fire engine returned Thursday from filling in at a county 
fire station in Thousand Oaks. The hospital's water tank truck remained on duty 
at the Ojai fire. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the city's Fire Department sent one fire engine and three 
firefighters to Santa Barbara Wednesday, said information officer Barry

And an Oxnard fire engine, with three firefighters, was due to return from the 
Santa Barbara fire Thursday, said Battalion Chief Murray Glidden. Oxnard 
officials had also called in an off-duty crew to work overtime, filling in for 
the crew that was dispatched to Santa Barbara, he said.

County Fire Department spokeswoman Wells said the county was still standing by

after the Ojai blaze, replacing workers exhausted from battling that fire.

"This is one of those things that is changing continually," Wells said. "We

<HEAD>First Lady Reports She Saw Rat in White House Pool</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Summit Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Lady Barbara Bush says she once encountered
a rat in the White House swimming pool.
   ``It did not look like a Walt Disney rat, I'll tell you that,''
Mrs. Bush told the Houston Post in an interview published today.
``I was out of that pool so much faster than I thought I could.''
   Mrs. Bush, who swims daily for exercise in the heated pool, said
President Bush came to her rescue during the incident a few months
ago.
   ``I swim with a mask, and it just went right by in front of
me,'' she said. ``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned
the beast. It was horrible.''
   Mrs. Bush said the confrontation with the rat was the worst
experience of her 18 month in the White House.
   The first lady planned to take the wives of other heads of
government attending the seven-nation economic summit on a tour of
the Alamo and other historical sites at San Antonio, Texas.
   Noting the friendly crowds that greeted the Bush motorcade
Monday at the start of the summit talks, Mrs. Bush said, ``I told
George this was the first time I've gone that far in a car ... when
everybody waved and there were no unfriendly gestures.''
   ``It's so wonderful,'' she said. ``George is tickled pink.''
   Mrs. Bush said she and her husband agree that foreign visitors
should see more than the East and West coasts of the United States.
   The president told Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at a
presummit social event last weekend that ``America is not the
coasts. This is America,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``Well, it is. This is
what you want people to see.''
