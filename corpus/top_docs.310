<TEXT>     As a director, Lean brought a jeweler's precision to sweeping film epics.
Robert Mitchum, who starred in "Ryan's Daughter," said working for him was
"like trying to build the Taj Mahal with matchsticks.";    Lean's directorial
career began in collaboration with Noel Coward and progressed to acclaimed
adaptations of Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist.";   
He was best known for the wide-screen spectaculars, which began with "Bridge
on the River Kwai" and included "Doctor Zhivago" and "A Passage to India.";   
In March, he was to have begun filming "Nostromo," a project based on Joseph
Conrad's novel that had been several years in the works. On Jan. 8, his French
producer Serge Silberman said Lean had been taken ill and that he was
undergoing medical tests. Work on the film was suspended.;    "I just love
telling stories," he said in a 1990 interview with the Times of London, the
city where he made his home.;    Born March 25, 1908, in Croydon, south of
London, Lean went to work in 1928 for Gaumont Studios as a number-board boy.
He soon displayed an aptitude for editing and was put in charge of Gaumont
Sound News, for which he also wrote scripts and provided narration.;    Lean
edited Gabriel Pascal's production of George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" in
1938 and Shaw's "Major Barbara" three years later.;    In 1942, his reputation
as a technician led to his being named co-director with Noel Coward of "In
Which We Serve," an award-winning drama of the Royal Navy in World War II.;   
Coward was pleased with the results and gave Lean permission to film any of
his plays. Lean and two others formed a production company that brought
Coward's "This Happy Breed" to the screen in 1944, followed a year later by
"Blithe Spirit" and "Brief Encounter.";    "Great Expectations," released in
1946, won three Academy Awards, plus Lean's first nomination as best
director.;    "The Bridge on the River Kwai" in 1957 was Lean's first great
success. The film won seven Academy Awards, including best director.;   
"Lawrence of Arabia," which made a film star of Peter O'Toole, followed in
1962. It also won seven Oscars, including one for Lean as director.;   
Ironically, this film was cut by others, losing about 20 minutes in the
process, and reappeared in its original form in 1989.;    Though Lean regarded
"Lawrence" as his best film, he had his greatest commercial success in 1965
with "Doctor Zhivago," based on Boris Pasternak's novel. The film won three
Oscars and a best-director nomination for Lean.;    "Ryan's Daughter" in 1970
was a critical disaster and something of a personal disaster as well. Lean did
not make another film for 14 years, though he tried in the mid-1970s to make a
film of the mutiny on the HMS Bounty but couldn't reach agreement on backing.;
   He returned to the screen in 1984 with "A Passage to India," based on E.M.
Forster's novel. Lean and the picture were both nominated for Academy Awards.;
   "Nostromo" was years in preparation, and Lean's style of craftsmanship took
its toll. Screenwriter Christopher Hampton left after a year of work.;    "I
drove poor Christopher Hampton mad," Lean said in an interview with the Sunday
Times of London in 1990.;    "We'd finish a large chunk and I'd say, 'Let's go
back to scene one.' He hated that. But that's me. I understand people not
wanting to go back to scene one, but you've got to if you want to do something
special.";    Lean was knighted in 1984.;    In 1990, he was honored with a
life achievement award from the American Film Institute.;    Married five
times, Lean had a son from his first marriage.;     David Lean's films; The

AFI LIFE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD TO BE GIVEN TO DAVID LEAN

<P>
The American Film Institute is going to have some great clips to show at its 
March 8 dinner next year. Sir David Lean, the director of such wide-screen 
epics as "Doctor Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River 
Kwai," has been named by the institute as the 18th recipient of its prestigious 
Life Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Englishman, who is still looking ahead to his planned 
adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel "Nostromo," is the eighth director and 
the first foreigner to be honored by the AFI since it began presenting its 
"living legend" award in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Ford was the AFI's first Life Achievement Award recipient and 
Gregory Peck its most recent. In between, the honor -- presented at a glamorous 
A-list Hollywood dinner that is taped for later network broadcast -- has gone 
to such actors as James Cagney, Lillian Gish, Bette Davis, Fred Astaire, Gene 
Kelly and Barbara Stanwyck, and to directors Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, 
Billy Wilder, William Wyler, John Huston and Frank Capra. 
</P>
<P>
"Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made enormous 
contributions to America's film heritage," said AFI chairman Gene Jankowski in 
announcing the name of the institute's 1990 winner. 
</P>
<P>
Lean, a Quaker who was not allowed to see movies as a child, stepped through 
the looking glass at the age of 19 when he got a job serving tea at an English 
studio and actually had to rise to the job of gofer. He later finagled work as 
an assistant film editor, working on newsreel footage captured during the early 
'30s, and was the credited film editor on the 1938 "Pygmalion." 
</P>
<P>
His began his directing career doing the action sequences for the 1942 war film 
"In Which We Serve," but his first step toward an AFI award came with his 1945 
adaptation of Noel Coward's "Brief Encounter." The film earned the then 
37-year-old Lean the first of six Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
He received his second nomination the following year for "Great Expectations," 
and 10 years later began a streak that included nominations for "The Bridge on 
the River Kwai" (1957), "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), "Dr. Zhivago" (1965), and 
"A Passage to India" (1984). He won the Oscar for "Kwai" and "Lawrence." 
</P>
<P>
The only film he has done since 1957 that did not earn him an Academy Award 
nomination was the 1970 Irish landscape spectacle "Ryan's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Critics are divided on Lean's overall position on the honor roll of film 
directors. Certainly, his epics show the deliberateness of a visual stylist and 
a meticulous storyteller; Lean has managed only 16 movies in 47 years of 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
For Hollywood, he was definitely the right director at the right time. With 
television spawning America's first generation of couch potatoes, the big 
screen had to get a lot bigger, and with "The Bridge on the River Kwai," Lean 
gave audiences plenty to look at while managing to keep the story as big as the 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Lean has not worked as much as he might have liked in the last two decades, 
because of the prohibitive costs of his kind of spectacle. For years, he and 
his writing collaborator, Robert Bolt, were planning an authentic historical 
version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." At one time, it was going to be done as two 
movies, each one costing about $30 million, then as an eight-hour miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Lean abandoned the project when it was clear no one would put up the money he 
needed to realize his vision. The film was eventually made in 1984 by director 
Roger Donaldson for Orion Pictures under the title "The Bounty."

<LEADPARA>  ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, David Lean was bivouacked in a hotel on a remote stretch
of Spanish coast, contemplating his 19th feature film, based on Joseph
Conrad's "Nostromo." Yes, Lean assured me long-distance, it would be a big
film (costing more than $30 million). Yes, it would deal with such favorite
themes as honor and responsibility. And, yes, he was expecting it to be a
"bugger of a nightmare" logistically, just as his Oscar-winning "Lawrence of
Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai" were.;    For a Steven Spielberg or
a James Ivory or a Bernardo Bertolucci, three of the many directors inspired
by Lean, the challenges would have been daunting but not insurmountable. But
Lean was two weeks shy of 81. How could he possibly handle the strain of
another monster production?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Longevity runs in family;  Lean waved off the question. "Both my mother and
father died after they were 95," replied the warm, clipped voice on the other
end. "That's a help. Also, I've had a wonderful life in movies. I've gone to
an awful lot of places. It keeps you in trim.";    Lean didn't make it quite
as far as his parents.;    The self-described storyteller died Tuesday at his
home in London at age 83. The cause of death was not disclosed, but Stephen
Silverman, a biographer of Lean, said he died of pneumonia.;    Lean had been
hospitalized in Paris in January after being stricken on the set of
"Nostromo." Work on the film had since been suspended.;    But before his
illness, you can bet Lean was happy and busy. A consummate craftsman and a
stickler for detail, he didn't know how to quit dreaming in 24 frames a
second.;    Lean doesn't leave behind a large body of work, but it is
considerable from an artistic standpoint.;    He was born March 25, 1908, in
Croydon, south of London, and got into the movie business in 1928 as a
number-board boy at Gaumont studios. He displayed an aptitude for editing, and
was put in charge of Gaumont Sound News, for which he also wrote scripts and
provided narration.;    After apprenticing as editor (on such classics as
"Pygmalion" and "One of Our Aircraft is Missing"), he made his solo directing
debut in 1944 on the very English, very stiff-upper-lip "This Happy Breed," by
playwright Noel Coward, who would continue to provide source material.;   
Dickens adaptation;  In 1946, Lean oversaw "Great Expectations," arguably the
best of the Dickens adaptations. The opening scenes on the moor, wherein young
Pip falls into league with a scurrilous escaped convict, have been discussed
and written about endlessly as the perfect fusing of studio ambiance,
performance and editing.;    Indeed, many critics argued that Lean was at his
best when working on a smaller scale, on more intimate social satires, such as
"Hobson's Choice" (1954, with Charles Laughton) and "Summertime" (1955, with
Katharine Hepburn).;    Lean disagreed. In his mind he was born to play a
composite of D.W. Griffith, Napoleon and Rommel of the Desert. Lean, in his
mid-40s, found his kindred spirit in British Col. Nicholson, the never-say-die
POW in "River Kwai," which won seven Academy Awards, including those for best
picture, actor (Alec Guinness) and director. Nicholson as played by Guinness
is anything but your typical wartime hero. In the killing heat of the Burmese
jungle, he becomes the victim of his own obsession. The enemy bridge -- a
miracle of Allied engineering -- becomes bigger than the war, or any
discussion of morality.;    Metaphor for Lean's life;  That bridge, you could
argue, became an apt metaphor for Lean's own life -- a life filled with
exhilarating feats and fueled by an obsessive drive for perfection.;    That
mix of bravura and fanaticism found a new face in T.E. Lawrence, played by
Peter O'Toole in Lean's 1962 award-winner "Lawrence of Arabia." Considered
Lean's masterpiece by many, "Lawrence" has become the standard for all
wide-screen epics, a three-hour-plus mix of intimate character detail and
panoramic desert vistas. Lean described it simply as "the story of a man who
failed. . . . They (the critics) said it was lacking in humanity. I think it
may have been ahead of its time.";    The distinctive Lean touch seemed to
atrophy in the '60s as the film maker went on to such visually ambitious but
dramatically overwrought works as "Doctor Zhivago" and "Ryan's Daughter." The
latter, featuring a miscast Robert Mitchum as a cuckolded Irish schoolteacher,
brought the worst reviews of Lean's career.;    Defends 'Zhivago';  "I tried
to make it over-the-top romantically," Lean acknowledged, "but didn't tell the
audience what I was doing. But I don't think they were correct on 'Zhivago.'
If you're going to make a film of a long book, you've got to make changes. . .
. I'm not ashamed of that one at all.";    Sadly, Lean's labor of love was
never made, at least as Lean envisioned it. After years of pre-production work
on a revisionist, two-part "Mutiny on the Bounty," scripted by regular
collaborator Robert Bolt, producer Dino De Laurentiis moved forward without
Lean. A shorter version with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins was released as
"The Bounty" in 1984.;    Lean never got over the humiliation and attacked De
Laurentiis publicly whenever offered a forum.;    "He (De Laurentiis) pulled
the carpet from under me. I think that was the best script Robert and I ever
did. It was heartbreaking to watch it go under.";    Comeback;  In 1984, at
age 76, he made a comeback with a sumptuous adaptation of E.M. Forster's "A
Passage to India." A dramatization of a scandal that rocked colonial India,
the film combined the scope and exacting craftsmanship of the old Lean and
went on to earn 11 Oscar nominations.;    After the Forster adaptation, Lean
plotted his next adventure in film-making, collected a steamer trunk full of
lifetime achievement awards -- including the American Film Institute's -- as
well as a knighthood, and held forth on how the industry was going to hell in
a hand basket.;    "Look at O'Toole in 'Lawrence.' Looks, talent and screen
presence. It's all there. Today, all we have are talking heads. I don't think
that's the way ahead for the cinema. Telling a story with pictures -- that's
movie-making. . . .;    "Whatever you think of 'Lawrence' as a movie, it's a
visual meal.";    And Lean was one of the cinema's great chefs.; FILMOGRAPHY;

WARM AFI TRIBUTE TO DAVID LEAN; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: CREATOR OF 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA' AND 'DR. ZHIVAGO' MIXES HUMOR WITH 
CRITICISM OF COMMERCIALISM.

<P>
Lectures, like loin of lamb, are best served warm, and those people at the 
American Film Institute's tribute to David Lean at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on 
Thursday night got both. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Lean, whose wide-screen masterpieces include "Lawrence of 
Arabia," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Doctor Zhivago," mixed wry British 
humor with the stern tone of a schoolmaster in lecturing his high-powered and 
captive Hollywood audience for its cautious, commercially homogenized films. 
</P>
<P>
Lean, asking to be forgiven his presumption, said that he got the green light 
for his long-planned adaptation of Joseph Conrad's "Nostromo" just two hours 
before arriving at the hotel, and it was high time, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"After months and months of talk," he said, "(it's) sort of asinine (to get the 
go-ahead for a film) only two hours before receiving this great honor." 
</P>
<P>
Lean -- taking the podium after a parade of tributes from old friends and such 
contemporary film makers as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Lawrence 
Kasdan -- tempered his scorn for the greed that he says governs Hollywood with 
his own passion for the medium. "I speak from the heart and because I love 
movies," he said, before delivering his apparently off-the-cuff lecture. 
</P>
<P>
Lean quoted Noel Coward, with whom he made his directorial debut in the 1942 
wartime drama, "In Which We Serve," as telling him to "always come out of 
another hole," to be surprising and daring. "We don't come out of any more new 
holes," Lean said. "We come out with Parts One, Two, Three and Four, and I 
think it's terribly sad." 
</P>
<P>
Lean said a staple diet of repeated themes "will sink us" and urged the studios 
to take risks, especially with young talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind for old birds like me -- we can take it -- but we have to protect 
our young. Please, you chaps in the money department, look out for the young 
ones. . . . This business lives on creative pathfinders." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from Lean, especially in the wake of clips from such films as "Kwai," 
"Lawrence," "Brief Encounter," "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist," the 
blunt criticism of current film making was taken enthusiastically. Lean had 
made similar comments during a tribute at Cannes last year and left that 
audience aghast. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's industry crowd was treated to one of the briskest and most 
seriously reverent tributes in the award's 18-year history. John Mills, whose 
David Lean films included "Ryan's Daughter" and "Great Expectations," flew 22 
hours "with no pay at the end of it" to honor Lean in person. Also on hand was 
composer Maurice Jarre ("Dr. Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia"), who spoke of 
Lean's lessons in "humility, tenacity and perfectionism." 
</P>
<P>
One of the evening's highlights was the appearance -- live via satellite from 
London, where it was 4 a.m. -- of Omar Sharif, who portrayed Zhivago, and Peter 
O'Toole, who co-starred with Sharif in "Lawrence of Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg told Lean and the audience that "Bridge on the River Kwai" and 
"Lawrence of Arabia" were the two films "that most made me want to be a film 
maker." Lawrence Kasdan told of how he and his brother had arrived seven 
minutes late for a showing of "Lawrence" and decided to wait six hours for it 
to begin again rather than go in late because "every moment" of a David Lean 
movie mattered. Martin Scorsese spoke of Lean's "landscapes of the spirit -- 
there's no such thing as an empty landscape in a David Lean film."

<LEADPARA>  THE passing last week of David Lean at age 83 removes yet another esteemed
figure from the art of motion pictures. Few directors can claim a track record
as successful as Lean's (a record that includes two best-director Academy
Awards for films that won a total of 28 Oscars). Fewer still can claim a body
of work so unflaggingly intelligent and meticulously crafted.;    But the fact
that most of Lean's films are available on video is a mixed blessing at best.
While every one of the pictures below ranks high on the "must see" list of
true film lovers, Lean's works since 1957 are so expansive, so sweeping, so
grandly scaled that they achingly emphasize the main drawback of home video:
We watch these films on a tiny TV set, rather than on the huge theatrical
screen for which they were intended. Can one be overwhelmed by the scope and
grandeur of Lawrence's Arabia, or by the vast landscapes of Zhivago's Russia,
when seen on a 27-inch TV screen? Simply, no.  </LEADPARA>

surround-sound TV, or perhaps writing the Camera One and Camera 3 people to

(1946; Paramount) and "Oliver Twist" (1948; Discount). Two superb Dickens
adaptations, both starring Alec Guinness.;     (box) "Hobson's Choice" (1954;
HBO). Charles Laughton is brilliant in this period comedy about a domineering
father running roughshod over his daughters' love lives.;     (box)
"Summertime" (1955; Embassy). Another romantic idyll; Katharine Hepburn plays
a spinster who falls in love in Venice.;     (box) "The Bridge on the River
Kwai" (1957; RCA/Columbia). British POWs are forced into slave labor in Burma
to build a railroad trestle vital to Japanese supply lines in this
unforgettable epic of courage and obsession, which won many Oscars, including
best picture, director and actor (Alec Guinness).;     (box) "Lawrence of
Arabia" (1962; RCA/Columbia). Lean turned the fascinating saga of enigmatic
English soldier T.E. Lawrence into an archetypal epic: intelligent, grandiose,
breathtaking and spellbinding. Oscars for best picture, direction, photography
and music. A must for the big-screen treatment; do not attempt to watch this
on video.;     (box) "Dr. Zhivago" (1965; MGM/UA). Pasternak's novel comes
lucidly alive in this panoramic tale of romance and revolution in Russia.;    
(box) "Ryan's Daughter" (1970; MGM/UA; rated R). Sprawling but overlong
romantic melodrama, full of spectacular pastoral scenery of Ireland.;    
(box) "A Passage to India" (1984; RCA/Columbia; PG). Fourteen years after the
critical failure "Ryan's Daughter," Lean emerged to display his mastery of the
medium in this multi-leveled, lushly photographed tale of cultural clashes
between the British and "the mysterious East."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The real story is an epic in its own right, and the real bridge, a black
steel expanse repaired after the war, remains an enduring monument to the
Allied prisoners of war and Asian laborers who died building it for the
Japanese.;   Unfortunately for their memory, the Bridge on the River Kwai has
also become a tourist trap, much to the dismay of many who come to visit the
site of their relatives' graves.;   From the bridge's graceful,
crescent-shaped spans, visitors can look out across the Kwai's waters and see
souvenir stands selling Bridge on the River Kwai T-shirts, Coke and Pepsi
signs in Thai, a foreign exchange van and a dozen speedboats moored in front
of a floating restaurant waiting to whisk tourists down the river.;   Why not
a River Kwai bumper sticker? Or maybe River Kwai tumblers, ashtray or baseball
cap? How about a documentary video for only $12? "Excellent souvenir," a sign
says.;   "The bridge itself is absolutely soured by the tourism and the
mercenary way the people are exploiting it," said Brian Kettell, a London
academic, on vacation here. "But this is Thailand, I suppose.";   Kettell was
drawn to the bridge, in part, by what he called its "tremendous
popularization" in England by David Lean's 1957 movie.;   Kettell conceded
that the film was not historically accurate.;   "But it's not totally
inaccurate, either," he said. "It does give a flavor of the story. There was a
bridge built, there was horrible suffering and the bridge was blown in the
end, albeit by the Americans, not by the British.";   A sense of that
"horrible suffering" -- and how it lives on -- is still to be felt in this
provincial city, 90 miles west of Bangkok, despite the blatant tourist
exploitation that includes a 10-day Bridge on the River Kwai festival every
fall, complete with sound effects of bombing and anti-aircraft fire.;   A mass
grave containing the skeletons of hundreds of Asian laborers was discovered
last year, right before the annual bridge bash, a major tourist event.;  
While cynics noted how convenient the timing was, finding the grave site did
help underscore the fact that more than 100,000 Asians -- Indians, Burmese,
Malays, Indonesians, Chinese and Thais -- perished while building the
so-called Death Railway, a 260-mile line connecting Thailand and Burma.;  
After invading and occupying Southeast Asia, the Japanese ordered construction
of the route in 1942 in preparation for an invasion of India. They completed
the line, which most said would take five years to hack through dense jungle
and mountain rock, in 13 months -- at tremendous human cost.;   Much better
known, of course, are the 16,000 Allied prisoners of war who died as well,
mostly British, Australian and Dutch, with several hundred Americans among the
victims.;   Trevor Dakin decided to retire in Thailand after visiting the
bridge as a tourist five years ago. Dakin, a former prisoner of war,
immigrated to Canada from Britain after the war and worked as a salesman for
an air-conditioning manufacturer. He figured his small pension would go a lot
further in Thailand than in Canada.;   Dakin also had a feeling that something
was beckoning him to return.;   "I have an affinity for this country," Dakin,
71, said. " . . . There were many times, my friend, when we would lie there in
the jungle and say, 'This is a beautiful country. I would like to see it in
better circumstances.' These 48 years later are the better circumstances."  </TEXT>

FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Sir David Lean - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most celebrated film director, Sir David Lean, died in London
yesterday after a long illness.
Sir David, 83, whose screen triumphs included Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge
On The River Kwai and Dr Zhivago, was taken ill earlier this year while
working on a Pounds 23m project in Europe. He was flown home from the south
of France for treatment but never recovered, his lawyer Mr Tony Reeves
announced. A private funeral will be held and a memorial service is to be
arranged.
Sir David, who married for the fifth time in December last year to Sandra
Cooke, had just completed work on the script of his adaptation of Joseph
Conrad's Nostromo. Its future is now in doubt.
Sir David's films won a total of 26 Oscars, making him one of the most
successful directors despite long periods of inactivity.
After learning his trade in the 1920s as a clapperboard boy and a 'wardrobe
mistress' he took charge of editing and commentary for Gaumont Sound News in
1930 - later moving to British Movietone News.
Within a few years he was Britain's highest-paid film editor, working on
successes like French Without Tears, Pygmalion and 49th Parallel.
He was invited to co-direct with Noel Coward the story of wartime life in
the Royal Navy, In Which We Serve. Its success in 1942 led him to direct
three other films written by Coward - This Happy Breed, Blithe Spirit, and
the widely acclaimed Brief Encounter - by 1946.
The early post-war years saw the critical and box office successes Great
Expectations, still regarded by many as his finest achievement, and Oliver
Twist.
His Dr Zhivago in 1965 was to earn more money than all his other films put
together. Another of his box office successes was Ryan's Daughter in 1970.
He was upset by the cool critical response the film received and did not
make another until A Passage To India in 1984.
But recognition of his achievements continued. In 1973 he received the
Directors Guild of America's highest accolade, the D W Griffith Award.
In 1983, the year before he was knighted, he was given one of the first
fellowships awarded by the British Film Institute.

   Syndicated advice columnist Abigail Van Buren,
Dear Abby to millions of newspaper readers, said people often ask
if she makes up the letters she prints.
   ``I couldn't begin to make up anything half as good as I get in
my morning mail,'' she said Thursday.
   Miss Van Buren, who began writing her column 33 years ago, said
she has fun with her responses, but takes her advice
responsibilities seriously.
   ``I never sacrifice sound judgment just for the sake of humor,''
she said.
   While the answers are her own, Miss Van Buren consults with
lawyers, doctors and other professionals.
   ``I don't write for laughs. My primary motive is not to
entertain. It's to inform,'' she told a group of newspaper
publishers.
   Miss Van Buren receives 10,000 to 15,000 letters each week.
   ``The best ones I can't print,'' she said.

   Sir David Lean, the English filmmaker who
created ``Doctor Zhivago,'' ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' will receive a life achievement award from
his American counterparts.
   ``Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made
enormous contributions to America's film heritage,'' Gene
Jankowski, chairman of the American Film Institute, said Thursday.
   ``You must be joking! This is remarkable,'' the 81-year-old Lean
responded when learning of the honor Wednesday, said filmmaker
Steven Spielberg, who broke the news as a trustee of the institute.
   Lean, the Life Achievement Award winner for 1990, joins 17
previous winners who include Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, James
Cagney and Bette Davis. Lean will be honored at a dinner March 8 in
Beverly Hills that will be broadcast by ABC-TV.
   Lean's hits include the 1957 Academy Award-winner ``The Bridge
on the River Kwai,'' and the 1962 Academy Award winner ``Lawrence
of Arabia. Lean made ``Dr. Zhivago'' in 1965, ``Ryan's Daughter''
in 1970 and ``A Passage to India'' in 1984.

   Singer Joan Jett abruptly ended a concert
after the first set when she was hit in the face with a bracelet
thrown from the crowd.
   Miss Jett spun away from the microphone holding her face
Thursday night, then kicked the mike stand over, strode to the edge
of the stage and shouted: ``Who ... did that?''
   Miss Jett left the stage, and a member of her road company
informed the crowd, ``The show is over, ladies and gentlemen. I'm
sorry, there had to be one jerk in the audience.''
   Miss Jett had a minor cut under her right eye, said Kasim
Sulton, bassist in her band the Blackhearts, after the show at a
fair.
   The bracelet thrower was never identified.
   Sulton said similar incidents happen ``fairly often'' on Miss
Jett's tours.

   Oddly enough, playing a broken-down alcoholic
helped Faye Dunaway's image.
   The 48-year-old actress says her acclaimed role in ``Barfly''
was ``a wonderful chance'' _ to work opposite Mickey Rourke and to
undo some of the negative publicity lingering from 1981's ``Mommie
Dearest.''
   ``Mickey Rourke comes to me in a Chinese restaurant downtown and
says, `I'm doin' this thing, you wanna do it?''' Dunaway said in
the Oct. 16 issue of US magazine.
   ``I thought: Great, deglamorize, get some soul out there. Turn
the perception around.''
   Dunaway, nominated for Academy Awards for her performances in
``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Chinatown'' and a winner for
``Network,'' was ridiculed for her overwrought portrayal of Joan
Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest.''
   ``It was a movie that didn't achieve what it set out to do,''
she said. ``It just went too far and became camp.''

   A mass grave has been discovered
near the site where more than 100,000 Asian slave workers and
Allied prisoners died building a railroad for the Japanese during
World War II.
   The remains of several hundred people have been dug up since
Tuesday, when the excavation began. It is being carried out by the
Pothipawana Songkroh Foundation, which for religious reasons wants
to provide proper burials.
   Several dozen workers were digging Sunday in a sugar cane field
in Kanchanaburi province, about 70 miles west of Bangkok. One skull
was left out overnight - but workers first covered it with paper so
it would not be cold.
   About half the small plot has been excavated.
   The mass grave is about three miles from a bridge made famous in
the 1957 Hollywood movie, ``Bridge Over the River Kwai,'' which
celebrated the heroism of the war captives.
   A foundation official, Santi Assawaseeyotin, said it appeared
the bones had been ``dumped into the ground, because they were
found in some disorder.''
   Santi said the bones were dating back to the World War II era.
   ``We believe they were bones of Asian people as the skulls found
were not big,'' he said. ``There also were children's bones.''
   He said the remains were being brought to the foundation's
office in Bangkok, where they will be cleaned and cremated.
   There was no direct evidence the bones belonged to the World War
II prisoners. No such remains have been found in Kanchanaburi in
recent years.
   Also recovered were metal plates and bowls; on the back of
several were written Made in Japan or Made in Hong Kong. The
Bangkok Post newspaper said some had the year 1939 imprinted on
them.
   More than 100,000 Chinese, Indian, Malay, Burmese and other
Asian slave laborers lost their lives building the railway in
1942-43, along with more than 16,000 British, Dutch, Australian,
American, and New Zealand prisoners of war.
   They died of disease, malnutrition, exhaustion, beatings and
executions.
   The Japanese had the 268-mile line connecting Thailand and Burma
built for their planned invasion of India.
   Ladda Matcha, 38, who lives near the grave, said the owner of a
motorcyle repair shop also near there recently dreamed that the
dead told him they could not breathe and asked him for help.
   The man contacted the foundation, whose representatives secured
permission from the landowner to dig, Mrs. Ladda said. The owner
knew of the remains on her plot, but used it to grow sugar cane.
   Mrs. Ladda's mother, Pab Borngern, 77, said the Japanese
constructed a military camp and tunnel in the area during the war.
   ``When the Indians (workers) died, they just carried them into
the hole they dug up,'' she said. ``At the place where they found
the bones, that was thousands of people buried there. Those peple
died because of fever.''
   The Bangkok Post quoted the landowner's sister, Lek Pailom, 64,
as saying field hospitals for Asian slave workers were in the area.
   ``Every morning, the Indians dug a hole in this area to bury
dead bodies in the evening,'' she said. ``Some days, two or three
bodies were buried, some days more than five.''
   ``This happened throughout the period of the railway
construction,'' she said.
   The discovery of the remains came just before the annual 11-day
River Kwai Bridge Festival. This major tourist attraction of
special shows and exhibitions is scheduled to begin Friday.
   In March, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan responded to
objections by Australian veterans groups and Prime Minister Bob
Hawke by barring shows that a tourism company planned along the
railway. They were to have featured Japanese soldiers supervising
work gangs.

   Eric Idle, like a knight-errant in comic
armor, has cut a swath from Monty Python's Flying Circus in his
native England to his new series for NBC, ``Nearly Departed.''
   He's also found time recently for a role as Berthold, the
fastest man alive, in ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and as
Passeportout, Phileas Fogg's woman-chasing, wine-bibbing French
valet, in the NBC miniseries ``Around the World in 80 Days.''
   In ``Nearly Departed,'' which makes its debut Monday, April 10,
he and Caroline McWilliams play spirits, only recently departed,
who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home.
   ``It's not polite comedy,'' he says. ``I seriously want those
people out of the house.''
   Idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmed
six episodes of ``Nearly Departed.''
   ``It takes twice as much time to do comedy,'' he says. ``They
don't give you enough lead time. The writer was reworking the
current script while he was writing the next week's script. I
didn't do any writing, but I'm allowed to rewrite and punch up. So
I put my bits in.''
   Idle plays an English lecturer at the University of Chicago who
is killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation. Instead
of heaven or hell, they go back to Chicago to haunt their old home.
   ``Nearly Departed'' is an original series but the concept has
occasionally popped up in such past projects as ``Blythe Spirit''
and ``Topper.''
   ``You get a chance to comment on people right in front of them
and they can't hear you,'' Idle says. ``We haunt Stuart Pankin and
Wendy Schaal and their child, Jay Lambert. Only the grandfather,
Henderson Forsythe, can hear us.
   ``It's necessary to have someone you can communicate with or it
doesn't relate. You can't make the comedy work without that.''
   Idle was in the forefront of British television's ``golden age
of comedy,'' both as a writer and an actor. He did three series
with Monty Python's ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited the
spinoff books and co-wrote and appeared in three Monty Python
movies.
   Idle's role in ``Around the World in 80 Days'' took him to
London, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Yugoslavia and the River Kwai in
Thailand.
   Some railroad scenes were filmed on the River Kwai Railroad, the
infamous line built by Allied prisoners of war in the movie ``The
Bridge Over the River Kwai.''
   ``Every foot of the railroad represents someone who died,'' Idle
says. ``It's beautiful and chilling at the same time.''
   Idle notes that since ``Around the World in 80 Days'' was
written by Jules Verne, a Frenchman, Passeportout receives a more
sympathetic treatment than does the Englishman Fogg.
   ``Verne pictured Fogg as the punctual Englishman who must have
his bath water at a certain temperature,'' Idle says, ``while
Passeportout chases women and drinks wine.''
   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' the new epic fantasy
from Columbia Pictures, was directed by Terry Gilliam, another
alumni of Monty Python. John Neville plays the title role. Robin
Williams plays the king of the moon.
   ``Munchausen was an 18th-century character who used to boast
about his exploits,'' Idle says. ``The tales eventually became
short stories that were favorites with children.
   ``I play an actor who plays Berthold in the play within a play.
I had my head shaved for six months in order to play Berthold. He
has spent 20 years in prison on the moon.''
   Idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of ``The
Wizard of Oz'' or a Cecil B. DeMille film.
   He says it's unlikely that the Monty Python team will get back
together, except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary.
Members of the ensemble were Gilliam, Idle, John Cleese, Terry
Jones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman.

   With the purchase of Columbia Pictures, Sony
Corp. is acquiring some of the most treasured American films ever
made, from the classic drama ``Lawrence of Arabia'' to the classic
slapstick of ``The Three Stooges.''
   The giant Japanese electronics manufacturer announced the $3.4
billion deal Wednesday, giving it another foothold in the U.S.
entertainment industry.
   Sony bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year while looking
for properties to provide records and movies it hoped consumers
would use with its stereos and videocassette recorders.
   The Columbia deal will give it control of a major production
studio, a film library of 2,700 movies and 23,000 episodes of
television programming in 260 series.
   Columbia was attractive because of its successful stable of
television productions and its two film studios, Columbia Pictures
and Tri-Star.
   Among Sony's new holdings will be 11 films that have won Academy
Awards as Best Picture, including two with themes that were
anti-Japanese. ``From Here to Eternity'' in 1953 climaxed with the
Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor that drew the United States into
World War II. ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, portrayed
inhumane conditions in a Japanese-run prison camp.
   Columbia's other Best Picture winners were: ``It Happened One
Night,'' 1934; ``You Can't Take it With You,'' 1938; ``All the
King's Men,'' 1949; ``On the Waterfront,'' 1954; ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' 1962; ``A Man For All Seasons,'' 1966; ``Oliver,'' 1968;
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' 1979; and ``Gandhi,'' 1982.
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The founders changed the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn led Columbia's rise in a tiny studio on Hollywood's
Poverty Row, and the company's growth accelerated with the 1928
arrival of Frank Capra, who promptly directed seven films.
   Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened One
Night,'' ``Lost Horizon'' and ``You Can't Take it with You'' _
helped establish Columbia as a major studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the 1930s and 40s _ ``One Night of Love,''
``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``The Jolson
Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among Columbia's
stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden, Kim Novak,
Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV
series. The film division continued to thrive with such hits as
``Born Yesterday,'' ``The Caine Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The television division has been boosted by newer shows such as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' while
continuing to receive revenue from such older productions as its
more than 200 ``Three Stooges'' shorts. The films, made between
1934 and 1958, are frequently shown on television.
   With Harry Cohn's death in 1958, Columbia became host to
independent producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence''); Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''); Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''); Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''); and Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'').
   Columbia sold its Sunset and Gower studios in the heart of
Hollywood in the late 1960s and moved production to The Burbank
Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros. Inc.
   The Coca-Cola Co. purchased Columbia in 1982.
   Despite the soft-drink empire's attempts to inject its
production and marketing techniques into the movie business, its
film divisions declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and
Columbia sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part interest to Coca-Cola shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest theater chains, with more than 800 screens in
220 locations.
   Still, Columbia's motion-picture arm has drifted in recent
years, with projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid
III'' and ``Casualties of War,'' failing to become runaway hits.

They call him Conan the Destroyer and his appetite is legend. He's Brian 
Conlan, an all-star offensive lineman from South Delta High School in Delta, 
British Columbia. He's headed for the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Says Conlan: "One time my mom cooked this big roast chicken and set it down on 
the table. Boy, was she surprised when I ate the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
His mother then watched him go through several helpings of rice, pasta and 
bread, all washed down with a quart of milk. 
</P>
<P>
Says Washington Coach Don James: "Obviously what we like about him is that he 
doesn't have to get a whole lot bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Conlan is 6-5 and 285.

<P>
Yuk, yuk: Bob Weiss, assistant coach of the Orlando Magic, was a teammate of 
Utah Coach Jerry Sloan when Sloan was named to six All-NBA defensive teams 
while playing with the Chicago Bulls. Weiss said Sloan, in his prime, could 
handle Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Really? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course." Weiss said. "Jordan would have been 12 then." 
</P>
<P>
Add Jordan: Asked after the last Chicago-Boston game if he thought Larry Bird 
had lost a step, he did a double-take and said, "He scored 38." 
</P>

Trivia time: What do Arnold Palmer, Hugh McElhenny and Elvis Presley have in 
common? Historic shot: Adding to his accomplishments on the tour, Gary Player 
the golf architect says, "I was the first golfer to hit a ball over the River 
Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
Player told the Atlanta Journal that he's building his own bridge across the

</P>
<P>
Golden harvest: The most productive draft in NFL history? How about 
Pittsburgh's in 1974? The Steelers landed Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John 
Stallworth and Mike Webster. 
</P>
<P>
He plays Bach, too: San Antonio Spur Coach Larry Brown, on David Robinson: 
"This is no ordinary kid. Asked why he blocked a shot, or defended a player so 
well, he says, 'Well, I couldn't let them drive the lane with impunity.' When 
was the last time you heard that?"

Never enough: Billie Jean King told the New York Times: "The only thing I 
regret is not making more money at the end of my career. One time I had some 
exhibitions lined up against Chris Evert at $100,000 a match, but Chris said 
she didn't want to lose to me in exhibitions at that stage of her career. I 
understood, but that would have been good money."

<HEAD>The Foreign Invasion: Foreign Films Popular at Oscars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir David Lean can only laugh at how calmly
Hollywood is taking this year's ``foreign invasion'' of the Academy
Awards:
   ``My Left Foot'' from Ireland, five nominations including best
picture; Camille Claudel'' from France, two nominations including
best foreign film; ``Henry V'' from England, three nominations
including best director.
   Yet, it's business as usual at the Oscars. There are, of course,
the usual arguments over who made it and who didn't, but nothing
like the press conference called by Samuel Goldwyn in 1946, when
Lean's ``Brief Encounter'' and Laurence Olivier's ``Henry V'' were
among several foreign films enjoying critical and commercial
success.
   ``Hollywood is facing a challenge,'' said Goldwyn, producer of
such films as ``Wuthering Heights'' and ``The Little Foxes.''
   ``Today it is by the British, tomorrow it may be the French or
the Italians or the Russians. To maintain it's place, Hollywood
must set aside the old formulas. It must find honest stories,
stories with something important to say, stories that reflect these
disturbing times in which we live.''
   Lean was amazed by Goldwyn's warning because he was sure ``Brief
Encounter'' would flop. After all, the film had closed down after
three days in one Italian city because, the British filmmaker had
heard, leading man Trevor Howard was too ugly.
   So when ``Brief Encounter'' was previewed at a tiny screening
room in Manhattan, Lean did his best to slip in and out unnoticed.
It didn't work.
   ``I waited until the lights went out and snuck in the back
because I just wanted to see what sort of print would be there,''
Lean said in a recent phone interview from Los Angeles, where he
received the American Film Institute's annual Life Achievement
Award.
   ``When the lights went up, I sneaked out. I got a few steps down
the passage, and a voice said, `Hi, excuse me.' It was the critic
from Time. `He said, `Tell me, did you direct that?' And I said,
`You're right, I did,' thinking he was going to say God knows what.
He said, `Let me shake your hand, that was marvelous.'
   ``And that was the first time I knew I was going to get a break
in America.''
   ``Brief Encounter'' received three nominations (but won no
Oscars) and Lean eventually felt right at home at the Academy
Awards, totaling 56 nominations and 27 awards for such films as
``Great Expectations,'' ``A Passage to India,'' ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   Since 1932 when Charles Laughton won best actor for the title
role in a British production of ``The Private Life of Henry VIII,''
Oscar has had an ambivalent relationship with foreign movies.
Hollywood preferred American products to win, but constantly
recognized worthy foreign efforts.
   Foreign films, especially British, have won various prizes from
cinematography (``Black Narcissus'') to best picture (``Hamlet''),
from screenwriting (``The Search'') to costume design (``La Dolce
Vita'').
   In 1956, foreign language film became a separate category.
Italy's ``La Strada'' won that year. But that didn't stop the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from nominating foreign
films and filmmakers in other categories. In 1966, the French film
``A Man and a Woman'' won a screenplay Oscar and was also named
best foreign film. In 1973, Sven Nykvist won the cinematography
award for Sweden's ``Cries and Whispers.''
   The British have dominated the Oscars on several occasions,
including ``Lawrence of Arabia'' in 1962, ``Tom Jones'' in 1963,
``Chariots of Fire'' in 1981 and ``A Room With a View'' in 1986.
   ``The Academy Awards in some ways is the absolute tops for a
moviemaker; you can't do better,'' Lean said. ``It's terrific to
get and I never thought I would get one.''
   Lean's favorite of his own films is ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
which was released in 1962 and earned seven Academy Awards,
including best picture and director.
   An ``adventure of a lifetime'' is how Lean remembered the 19
months of location work for the film. ``Anybody who can go out and
live in the desert for a year is a lucky man,'' he said of the
title character.
   For the starring role, he wanted Albert Finney, one of Britain's
hottest young actors at the time, but after four days of testing,
Finney turned him down. Lean took a chance and cast a then unknown
Peter O'Toole.
   ``I was desperate because I didn't have a leading man,'' Lean
said. ``I went to a theater in the West End and I saw a film called
`The Day They Robbed the Bank of England,' and in it was Peter
playing a small part. I had never seen him before. As he came on
the screen, I thought, `Wait a minute, that's a star.'''
   But it's not as much fun anymore, insists Lean, who has made
just two films in the past 20 years: ``Ryan's Daughter'' and ``A
Passage to India.'' There's too much talk about money, and ever
since ``Easy Rider'' in 1969, producers have been looking for hit
films that cost little to make.
   The director even longs for the return of bosses such as
Goldwyn, tirades and all.
   ``Hollywood was something special,'' Lean said. ``Those chaps
like Goldwyn, they were uneducated, but all of them, however tough,
whatever they were, they just loved movies and sought quality. Now,
it's, `How much?'''
   Lean spoke of a recent dinner with Billy Wilder, another
Oscar-winning director and AFI honoree who has struggled to find
work. They talked about the problems of being part of Hollywood
history in a business that's always looking ahead.
   ``When you get over 80 the pressures are worse than they ever
were,'' said Lean, who turns 81 on March 25, the day before the
Academy Awards presentation.
   ``Billy's bright as a button, really entertaining and really
quick. You would think by the way he's treated, he's just
beginning. Anybody who makes `The Apartment' and `Some Like It Hot'
should be up in the highest position.''
   Fortunately, Lean said, he likes the young directors who greeted
him so warmly on his recent trip. He is especially enthusiastic
about Oliver Stone and predicts that Stone and other directors will
eventually take control of Hollywood from the agents and lawyers.
   Stone recently won the Directors Guild award for his ``Born on
the Fourth of July,'' which has received eight Oscar nominations
including best picture.
   ``The filmmakers in Hollywood I think are very special. They're
really keen and they're all bright and intelligent and they've got
a sense of humor. They are full of enthusiasm that doesn't seem to
be at all envious of others,'' Lean said.
   ``They just give it to you on a plate. It's very nice for an old
bird to get that.''

   Actor Charlton Heston predicts that epic films
like ``Ben Hur'' or ``Lawrence of Arabia'' will soon be as obsolete
as silent movies.
   The movie, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' cost more than `Ben Hur,'
so that means they don't makemovies like that,'' Heston said in an
interview this week on the syndicated television show
``Personalities.''
   ``They will never make a `Lawrence of Arabia' again. They will
never make `Bridge on the River Kwai' again, which is too bad,''
Heston said. ``But we got to make those movies and I'm glad we did.
   ``People make fewer films now,'' Heston said.
   Heston, 67, also decried the high price of a movie ticket.
   ``You know, I just found out - because I get into a lot of
movies for free - that they're charging $7 to go to a movie in Los
Angeles now. Now, that's terrible.''
   Heston won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben Hur. The
film, about Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an
11-minute chariot race that Heston has said is the greatest action
sequence ever filmed.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Country entertainers Waylon Jennings and
Willie Nelson are joining forces to develop a club where they can
perform from time to time.
   The club, to be called ``Waylon and Willie's Cafe,'' will be on
the city's Mud Island tourist park which is undergoing renovation
as a companion project to the Great American Pyramid.
   The pyramid, a 32-story, stainless steel structure, is scheduled
to open next summer. Mud Island, a struggling nearby tourist park,
is being refurbished to become ``Festival Island.''
   The island and pyramid, though both owned by local government,
will be run by private companies controlled by businessman Sidney
Shlenker.
   Jennings, in Memphis for a performance Monday night, said the
club he plans with Nelson will have about 200 seats. Jennings said
he and Nelson will perform there several times a year, but he
didn't say exactly how many that meant.
   Mud Island is a three-mile-long sandbar in the Mississippi
River. Most of the island is being developed as residential
property.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Singer Julio Iglesias says he knows his
limitations and that means his world is on a sound stage, not a
movie set.
   Iglesias said he decided not to pursue an acting career because
``I am the worst actor on earth,'' the singer confessed in an
interview to be shown on ``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   ``I did a film 20 years ago and when I saw the film again, I
felt guilty and embarrassed,'' he said.
   ``I need to sing,'' Iglesias told Rivers, but ``I don't need to
spend two hours singing in a movie.''
   Iglesias admits he would ``love to do that - it's such a nice
situation to be an actor,'' but he says, ``I can't make it.''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Patrick Lilley, the actor who played Eddie
Munster in the 1960s television series, ``The Munsters,'' has
pleaded innocent to charges that he robbed his limousine driver
outside a suburban gas station.
   Lilley, 37, of Gardenia, Calif., entered the plea Monday before
DuPage County Circuit Judge Edward Kowal.
   The actor and John P. Sullivan, 32, of Chicago, were in a rented
limousine Nov. 2 when they allegedly robbed the driver of $140,
authorities said.
   Lilley, who used the stage name Butch Patrick in the hit
television series, was in the Chicago area making appearances at
Halloween parties and signing autographs for fans, police said. He
had been to two bars and was on his way to a Naperville hotel when
the robbery occurred.
   Police said no weapons were involved in the robbery.
   Sullivan also has pleaded innocent.

   ``The Last Emperor,'' which swept last year's
Academy Awards, won this year's top British film award Sunday night,
while two stars from ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' won top acting awards.
   The Danish movie ``Babette's Feast'' won as best foreign language
film and Louis Malle took top directing honors for ``Au Revoir Les
Enfants.'' Both movies had also been nominated for best film of 1988.
   Sir Alec Guinness, the 74-year-old veteran actor, received the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts' most prestigious award,
becoming a fellow of the academy. It was presented by Oscar-winning
director Sir David Lean instead of fellow director Sir Richard
Attenborough, who was hospitalized Sunday morning for suspected
kidney stones.
   Guinness, who won an Oscar for ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
in 1957, has been nominated for another Oscar this year for his
supporting role in ``Little Dorrit.'' The Academy Awards will be
presented in Hollywood on March 29.
   Comedian John Cleese was chosen best actor as the reserved
English lawyer who lost his inhibitions to an American woman thief,
played by Jamie Lee Curtis, in ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   Cleese, accepting the award from actor Dudley Moore in Los
Angeles, said in a closed-circuit TV relay he thought it should have
gone to co-star Kevin Kline, who was also nominated for his role as
a manic jewel thief. Kline is nominated for an Oscar but Cleese is
not.
   Michael Palin, the movie's stuttering animal lover who was forced
to watch his goldfish swallowed and to accidentally cause the deaths
of several dogs, got the best supporting actor award.
   ``It was a marvelous film to work on _ except if you're a fish or
a dog,'' he joked in accepting the award. ``I want to thank John
Cleese who upgraded me from a pet salesman to a pet murderer and all
the doggies who gave their lives.''
   The Michael Balcon award for outstanding British contribution to
cinema went to Charles Crichton, director of ``A Fish Called Wanda''
and more than a score of other films.
   Two of Britain's leading ladies walked off with the best actress
awards, Maggie Smith for her starring role as a spinster piano
teacher in Dublin in ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne'' and
Dame Judi Dench for her supporting role as the pushy mother in ``A
Handful of Dust.'' Both are previous British award winners.
   Ms. Smith skipped the ceremony because of a broken shoulder.
   Bernardo Bertolucci, accepting the best picture award for his
epic film ``The Last Emperor'' about Chinese Emperor Pu Yi, praised
the important British contribution to the movie's technical and
acting success, including actor Peter O'Toole, who lost out in the
best supporting actor competition.
   ``A World Apart'' won for best original screenplay, ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' for best adapted screenplay,
``Empire of the Sun'' for best score, and ``Defense Counsel Sedov,''
a Soviet movie about the righting of injustice, as best short film.
   The main Oscar nominees _ ``Rain Man,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
``Mississippi Burning,'' ``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Working
Girl'' _ were ineligible for the British awards because they were
not released in Britain during 1988.
   More than 2,300 people packed the grand ballroom at the Grosvenor
House Hotel for the ceremony. Actors Ben Kingsley and Edward Fox and
actresses Shirley Maclaine and Hayley Mills were among the
celebrities who presented awards.

<HEAD>Sony Won't Make Rambo a Samurai After Buyout of Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the next Hollywood blockbuster hits American
movie screens, you may be able to say, ``It's a Sony.''
   Sony Corp. says its $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., which follows its 1987 buyout of CBS Records,
is aimed at getting involved in making ``software'' to use in the
audio-visual equipment it sells.
   But don't worry about Rambo decked out as a samurai next time
around, or Michael Jackson singing in Japanese.
   What Sony wants out of these American companies, say analysts,
is for them to keep doing what they're best at _ turning out the
American-style entertainment that dominates cinema and music
markets worldwide.
   Sony's recent wheeling and dealing involved some of America's
pop icons: Rambo, Bruce Springsteen, and Coca-Cola Co., to name a
few.
   Sony announced Wednesday it is buying the Columbia studios, home
of Rambo. Two years ago it plunked down $2 billion for CBS Records,
which has contracts with stars such as Springsteen and Michael
Jackson.
   Meanwhile, Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion from
selling its 49 percent share in Columbia to Sony.
   But while a few American pundits have raised concerns that Sony
may use its new media clout for ``propaganda'' purposes, industry
analysts in Tokyo scoff.
   ``I don't think they would be so stupid,'' says Martin
Beresford, a senior analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
Propaganda films probably wouldn't be great hits at the box office,
he notes, and censorship would be too dangerous.
   ``Sony is far too sophisticated to consider something as
blatantly inappropriate (as propaganda or censorship) ... they know
that even the merest whiff of that would constitute an enormous
public relations risk.''
   Analysts say Sony has taken a hands-off policy at CBS Records,
leaving the music-making to Americans while providing Japanese
financial backing. So far this formula has made the CBS venture far
more profitable than analysts had expected.
   Sony's last annual report noted with satisfaction that ``a large
number of hit albums'' from CBS contributed to a 37.9 percent
annual increase in overall sales, which hit $16.2 billion in the
year ended March 31. The company's net income, at $549 million, was
up 94.6 percent from the previous year.
   ``As is the case with CBS Records, we would intend to operate
Columbia as a U.S. company with U.S. management,'' Sony President
Norio Ohga said.
   In effect, Sony wants to sell American ``software'' _ what used
to be known as movies and television shows _ in new forms, such as
laser disks and 8mm video tapes.
   Analysts say it's a rational division of labor.
   While Japanese electronics companies are crack manufacturers and
exporters of gee-whiz technology, the Japanese film and music
industries are about as competitive in world markets as American
soy sauce makers.
   U.S. movies, by contrast, are one of America's biggest export
success stories from London to Bangkok to Katmandu. Hollwood is
dream-seller to the world, with entertainment ranking as America's
second largest export, netting $5 billion annually.
   Rambo can be seen (surreptitiously) in even isolationist Burma;
``The Last Emperor,'' also a Columbia film, was shown in China. In
South Korea, American films are so popular that alleged agents of
local filmmakers, fearing competition, released snakes and tear gas
into theaters to discourage people from seeing directly distributed
U.S. films.
   The reception in Tokyo is friendlier. Japanese love American
films as much as Americans love Japanese electronics. America
exports more movies to Japan than to any other single market;
entertainment is one area in which the United States enjoys a
surplus with its economic archrival.
   ``For many Japanese, `movies' means American movies. They don't
think of American films as foreign films,'' says Hidekazu Tanaka,
an official at Columbia Pictures' Tokyo branch.
   Among films shown in Japan last year, 289 were American,
according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Only 102
were Japanese.
   The top four grossing films in Japanese history were ``E.T.,''
``Star Wars,'' ``Jaws,'' and ``Ghostbusters,'' according to
industry statistics.
   ``Ghostbusters,'' a Columbia release, brought in profits of
$17.8 million in 1984. ``Fatal Attraction'' recovered all of its
production costs in Japanese theaters alone.
   Sony is reportedly eager to expand the number of Columbia's
library of more than 2,700 movies available on laser disk and 8mm
video. Classic Columbia films popular in Japan include ``Bridge
over the River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' and ``On the
Waterfront.''

   Sir David Lean, the 82-year-old director whose
films have won 27 Academy Awards, is planning to marry for the
sixth time, his lawyer said Monday.
   Lean will wed 51-year-old interior designer Sandra Cooke before
Christmas, said attorney Michael Gee.
   The couple met five years ago in the frozen-food department of
Harrods department store where Ms. Cooke went up to Lean and asked
when his next film was due, said The Daily Mail's columnist Nigel
Dempster.
   Lean and Ms. Cooke were vacationing in France, Gee said. The
director's next film project will be an adaptation of Joseph
Conrad's novel ``Nostromo.''
   Lean is the director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Great Expectations.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - NBC newswoman Jane Pauley, who has interviewed
hundreds of celebrities, says she's still waiting to land an
elusive scoop: her husband, Garry Trudeau.
   ``I have thought about asking him,'' said Pauley, ``but a) he
would never do it, and b) I would not ultimately do it. But I know
it's a neat story.''
   Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, celebrates
Doonesbury's 20th anniversary this month.
   In an interview in the Oct. 8 issue of People magazine, Pauley
said Trudeau believes that ``the more high profile you become, the
more you have to maintain it. And you have to adjust your life for
updates, just to keep everyone aware, which is time consuming.''
   But Pauley said someone should persuade Trudeau to do an
interview.
   ``It's not going to be me, but I'm just going to be really
irritated if it turns up on somebody else's network.''

   Former major leaguer Jim Bouton struck out
Monday with his pitch to the Supreme Court to revive a big-stakes
contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product.
   Bouton lost an appeal to revive a $1 million damage award. The
justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the
award against a subsidiary of the Wrigley chewing gum company.
   Bouton, a best-selling author and former pitching star, was with
a minor league team in Portland, Ore., in 1977, when he and coach
Rob Nelson came up with the idea that led to Big League Chew,
shredded bubble gum in a pouch.
   The idea was to devise a good-tasting substitute for chewing
tobacco, a macho symbol for many big leaguers.
   The novelty was a bonanza that launched Bouton's business
career. Sales were $18 million in 1981 after Bouton and Nelson
teamed up with Amurol Products Co. of Naperville, Ill., a Wrigley
subsidiary, to market the bubble gum.
   Bouton, who lives in Teaneck, N.J., got into a dispute with
Amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for the gum. That led
to a Mailgram the company sent to Bouton agreeing to new contract
terms.
   A federal judge in New York City ruled that Amurol violated the
agreement, and ordered it to pay Bouton and his partner nearly $1
million plus interest.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May overturned
the award.
   Bouton retired from baseball in 1970 and wrote ``Ball Four,'' a
humorous account of his life in the sport that was on the
best-seller list for months.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A car dealer has offered Mayor Bill
Boner $75,000 to resign. But Boner was busy in Hawaii, where he
reportedly was marrying an aspiring country singer on Monday.
   ``It is obvious to all of Nashville that Bill Boner is
distracted from his job,'' businessman Lee Beaman said Friday.
``Our city is suffering from the void in leadership.
   ``In order to make it easier for Mayor Boner to resign, I have
offered to pay the $75,000 in salary he would be giving up if he
resigns now.''
   Boner, 45, turned heads in Nashville when he announced his
engagement to Traci Peel, 34, while he was still married to his
third wife.
   Boner's exploits were well chronicled after the Nashville Banner
published an interview with Peel in which she said the mayor's
passion could last seven hours. Bumper stickers quickly appeared
that said: ``Seven hours for Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   Boner spokesman Rick Runyeon said he knew nothing of the offer.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder, who spent
seven months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, is
off for a new pastorship in Kentucky.
   Magruder, 55, has been executive minister at First Community
Church in Marble Cliff since 1984. On Nov. 1, he will take over as
senior pastor of the 600-member First Presbyterian Church in
Lexington, Ky.
   ``Life began for me again when I came here six years ago,''
Magruder told 1,000 worshipers Sunday. ``You gave me back my
identity and you gave me the inspiration to continue in my
ministry.''
   Magruder pleaded guilty in 1973 to conspiracy and perjury
charges stemming from the 1972 break-in at offices of the
Democratic Party at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.
   He was deputy director of former President Nixon's re-election
committee.

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Scott Heimdal, who was held kidnapped
earlier this year while working in a South American jungle, has
married his Ecuadorian girlfriend and is settling back into a life
``as normal as can be.''
   Heimdal, 27, married Sandra Durango on Saturday. Other than the
groom forgetting his dress shoes on the way to church, the wedding
went off without a hitch. The bride's family traveled to Peoria
from their home in Quito, Ecuador.
   Heimdal was working for a mining company when he was taken
captive April 28 in the jungle along the Colombian-Ecuadoran
border. He was released two months later after his parents bought
his freedom for $60,000, raised in a frantic four-day fund drive.
   ``Life is as normal as it can be, getting married and all,'' he
said. But he was having trouble finding a job.
   ``I'll stay in Peoria if I can,'' said Heimdal, who specializes
in computers. ``With getting married, it's very frustrating not
being able to find work in Peoria.''

<HEAD>War-Torn Sri Lanka Makes Great Locale for Movies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Indiana Jones sought the Temple
of Doom in India, he was really doing it in Sri Lanka. Likewise,
when Tarzan romped through the jungle he was not in Africa but near
the Sri Lankan hill town of Kandy.
   The late filmmaker Sir Carol Reed once referred to Sri Lanka as
``the most natural and complete outdoor set,'' and this island
nation, despite its long war by Tamil militants for a separate
homeland, continues to lure American and British moviemakers.
   The fight by Tamil guerrillas for an independent nation for
their minority people broke out in 1983. The Tamils, who are 18
percent of the island's 16 million people, claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.
   Since 1980, at least seven major films have been produced around
the lush mountains, dense jungles, rivers and waterfalls near
Kandy, barely a three-hour drive into the hills from the capital of
Colombo.
   Villages near Kandy, once the capital of a Buddhist kingdom,
have been villages everywhere from Vietnam to Africa in various
movies.
   ``Sri Lanka has managed to cheat as countries like India,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines,'' said Asoka Perera,
managing director of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited.
   Perera's company helps scout locations for movies, and he said
Sri Lanka's success in drawing filmmakers is due to a lack of red
tape involved in shooting here.
   One of the first major movies made in Sri Lanka was in 1956 when
director David Lean filmed his hit movie ``Bridge on the River
Kwai'' on the island, then known as Ceylon. The film about British
POWs in Burma who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese
during World War II, won six Academy Awards.
   The movie was set partly here, so when William Holden escaped a
Japanese prison on Burma and made his way through fierce jungle and
across sun-baked seas to a British base on Ceylon, he was really
just around the corner from where he started.
   Paramount's ``The Purple Plain'' with Gregory Peck, also about
the Burma campaign during World War II, and ``Elephant Walk''
starring Elizabeth Taylor in a movie about a Ceylon tea plantation,
were both made in 1954.
   But Sri Lanka lost out as a location for foreign movies from
1970-77 when the pro-socialist government led by the Sri Lankan
Freedom Party viewed anything coming from the West as decadent.
   It was not until 1980 that the trend was reversed when John
Derek's ``Tarzan the Apeman'' was filmed starring his wife, Bo
Derek, and Richard Harris.
   Since then, movies shot in Sri Lanka have included the George
Lucas-Steven Spielberg ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'';
``Mountbatten _ the Last Viceroy''; ``Light Over the Water,'' which
was set partly in Australia; ``Further Adventures of Tennessee
Buck,'' in which Sri Lanka masquerades as Africa; and ``Jungle
Heat,'' in which the country plays itself.
   ``Iron Triangle,'' about an American troop operation in Vietnam,
completed production here in February and is to be released later
this year. It stars Beau Bridges and Haing S. Ngor, who won an
Academy Award for supporting actor in Roland Joffe's critically
acclaimed ``The Killing Fields.''
   Jayantha Jayatillaka, of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited, said
films made here earn the country needed foreign exchange and give a
boost to the tourist industry. Expenditures on filming in Sri Lanka
were reported to be $8 million for ``Indiana Jones,'' $5 million
for ``Tarzan the Apeman'' and $3 million for ``Iron Triangle.
   Sri Lanka's mix of cultures also helps producers find ``extras''
for their projects, thus reducing their costs, Jayatillaka said.
   ``For the making of `Iron Triangle,' Sri Lankans of Chinese
descent and those who were descendants of traders from Malaysia
were recruited to play Vietnamese,'' he said.
   But Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict, born from that same cultural
mix, has blocked filming on some parts of the island, Perera said.
   ``Some of the scenes of `Tarzan the Apeman' were filmed at the
beaches in eastern Trincomalee district in 1980 before the violence
broke out,'' he said. ``Since 1983, we have to stay clear of the
north and east despite the fact there are some beautiful locations
there.''
   But Perera said spectacular scenery and miles of palm-lined
beaches exist elsewhere on the island.
   The island is being considered for a movie about a journalist in
the Philippines during the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The movie's star, Rebecca Gilling of the Australian TV series
``Return to Eden,'' was recently in Colombo with producer Bob
Markowitz. Keeping with the international spirit of moviemaking
here, the production is being handled by an Australian company.

SONY TO CASH IN ON COLUMBIA'S CACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The library that Japanese electronics giant Sony will get with its pending 
takeover of Columbia Pictures includes the greatest film ever made about its 
country's bombing of Pearl Harbor -- Fred Zinnemann's 1953 Oscar-winner "From 
Here to Eternity." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will also become part of 
Sony's collection: "Hellcats of the Navy," their 1957 film about the exploits 
of a World War II submarine, now sits in the Columbia library. 
</P>
<P>
While not considered one of Hollywood's best, Columbia's library includes 12 
best picture Academy Award winners, such recent hits as "Ghostbusters II," 
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Tootsie," and such popular American 
TV sitcoms as "I Dream of Jeannie," "Bewitched," "Gidget," "The Monkees" and 
"Dennis the Menace." 
</P>
<P>
These titles are among the 2,700 feature films and 2,300 episodes of 260 TV 
series that Columbia holds in its library. Lisbeth Barron, an entertainment 
analyst with McKinley, Allsopp Inc. in New York, estimates that the Columbia 
library alone is worth $1.05 billion, and that it generates about $75 million a 
year in cash flow for the studio. (In contrast, Turner's 3,700-title MGM 
library, which he bought three years ago for $1.3 billion, generates about $175 
million a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Sony is anxious to get its hands on these films and TV shows -- called 
"software" in corporate parlance -- to service the high-tech hardware it 
manufactures. The company already produces laser-disc video players and has a 
push on to get consumers to buy its 8-millimeter cassette player. Sony also is 
developing technology for high-definition TV. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have the library, they can force you to buy their kind of hardware," 
explained Naofumi Okamoto, president of a Japanese-owned film studio here, 
Apricot Entertainment. Sony, he said, learned a hard lesson six years ago when 
the company's Betamax videocassette technology lost the battle for consumer 
loyalty to the rival VHS format. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Columbia's feature film library is not as highly regarded as some 
of the others, Sony will certainly be getting plenty of big-name pictures for 
its money. Columbia is tied with United Artists for the most best picture 
winners, an even dozen that began with the classic 1934 "It Happened One Night" 
and includes two from the current decade: "Gandhi" from 1982 and "The Last 
Emperor" of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades during Hollywood's Golden Era, from 1932 to 1958, 
Columbia president Harry Cohn ran his studio on a shoestring. The studio was 
late in introducing color because it was expensive, and Cohn kept few big stars 
under contract, said Jere Henshaw, who served as casting director for the 
studio during the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia was always behind," said Henshaw, now an independent producer at 
Apollo Pictures. "They didn't have much of a library. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a plethora of B-films from that period, titles like "Snow White 
Meets the Three Stooges," "Jungle Moon Men," "Screaming Mimi," "The Tingler" 
(in which theaters put "tinglers" in their seats to tickle customers), "The 
Legend of Tom Dooley" (based on the song) and "Have Rocket Will Travel" 
(starring the Three Stooges in outer space). 
</P>
<P>
But Cohn did manage to attract some key film-making talents, like directors 
Frank Capra, Robert Rossen, David Lean, Elia Kazan and Fred Zinnemann. Capra 
directed "It Happened One Night," as well as the classics "Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington" and "You Can't Take It With You," the 1938 Oscar winner. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cohn, Columbia subsequently won best picture Oscars for Rossen's "All the 
King's Men," Zinnemann's "From Here to Eternity," Kazan's "On the Waterfront" 
and Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn died in 1958, but the studio continued to do well at Oscar time, winning 
three Academy Awards for best picture during the 1960s -- for Lean's "Lawrence 
of Arabia," Zinnemann's "A Man for All Seasons" and Carol Reed's "Oliver!" 
</P>
<P>
Robert Benton's "Kramer vs. Kramer" won the best picture award for the studio 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Other popular Columbia titles include "Shampoo," "The Way We Were," "Funny 
Girl," "The Last Picture Show," "The Big Chill" and "Tootsie." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, Columbia has 100, even 200, great titles," said Henshaw. But, he added, 
libraries like those at MGM, Fox and Paramount boast many hundreds of films 
that have proved popular over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia's library has neither the value nor the quality of other studio 
libraries," added a high-ranking executive at another company who is familiar 
with all the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia library, said Barron, "is much more extensive on the TV side. It's 
a bit weaker on the feature side." 
</P>
<P>
Among Columbia's TV shows are dozens of sitcoms that will generate millions of 
dollars in the rerun market. Current hits include "Who's the Boss?" "227," 
"Designing Women," "My Two Dads" and "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's array of sitcoms will give Sony a leg-up over a key competitor, 
MCA-Universal, whose library is dominated by hourlong series. Although one-hour 
action adventure shows do much better than sitcoms overseas, reruns of sitcoms 
are most popular here. 
</P>
<P>
"The big money is coming in from half-hour shows," said Barron. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia also owns the rights to the game shows created by Merv Griffin: "Wheel 
of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" 
</P>
<P>
Barron believes that Sony substantially overpaid for all of Columbia Pictures'

   ``Hello dear. You're very handsome. Yes you are,''
Sir Alec Guinness coos through the cage at a rhinoceros.
   ``You've got a sweet face, very pretty ears,'' the elder
statesman of British acting says, as he strolls through Berlin's
central Zoologischen Garten.
   His chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful
characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades
as one of the world's finest, most chameleon-like talents.
   On this particular day, the Berlin Film Festival was awarding
the 73-year-old Guinness its special ``Ehren Bear'' (honorary bear)
for lifetime achievement in the cinema. The actor, however, elected
to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a
romp in the zoo.
   ``I'm not actually that keen on them; I hate to see certain
animals caged up,'' he said.
   ``But I remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively
laid out on the open plan, and I thought it might be amusing to
have a second look.'' He last visited the Zoologischen Garten 14
years ago.
   Images of some of the zoo's reported stock of 10,000 animals
have lingered: ``They used to have white rhinoceroses there that
were charming. And a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds _ an
old thing that was like a symbol of Berlin; a splendid, great
creature.''
   This time around, Guinness' observations are as keen as ever,
whether applied to the varieties of zoo-bound species or the
special tributes that have marked his career.
   In 1980, he received a special Academy Award to honor a range of
work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister Fagin in ``Oliver
Twist'' (1948), a comic octet of murder victims in ``Kind Hearts
and Coronets'' (1950), the hard-driving Colonel Nicholson in ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), the aging mystic Ben Obi-Wan
Kenobi in ``Star Wars'' (1977) and its sequels.
   Last year, he was twice feted in lavish galas _ in April at New
York's Lincoln Center and in May at the Cannes Film Festival.
   The occasion in Berlin may be less tony, but its significance is
no less clear: in the Festival's 38 years, Guinness is only the
second actor to be so honored, following James Stewart in 1982.
   ``I'm afraid when you get rather elderly, these things seem to
come on you rather more than you might wish,'' he says, his brisk
gait belying his years, his nose becoming slightly red in the
seasonal chill.
   A signpost draws his attention: ``I think that way may be the
pheasantry. Do you mind if we go in there?''
   Somewhere between pheasants and finches, the conversation turns
to work. His latest project is ``Little Dorrit,'' the six-hour film
adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel in which he plays William
Dorrit, a long-term inmate of a debtor's prison who finds that
sudden wealth brings sudden freedom.
   Guinness had not performed Dickens since the 1940s, when he both
adapted ``Great Expectations'' for the stage and made his movie
debut as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's 1946 film version. He then
appeared in ``Oliver Twist'' in 1948. He considers ``Little
Dorrit'' to be one of Dickens' two or three greatest novels.
   ``Dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go
over the top,'' he said.
   Later this year, he'll be seen as Mr. Todd in a movie of Evelyn
Waugh's 1934 novel, ``A Handful of Dust.'' Then there's Lee
Blessing's current Broadway play, ``A Walk in the Woods,'' which
Guinness may do on the London stage. He last trod the West End
boards in Alan Bennett's ``The Old Country'' in 1977-8.
   ``It's a very distinguished piece of writing,'' he says of the
play. But Guinness acknowledges its pitfalls, as well: ``The amount
of learning for a two-hander is horrendous. An actor's great fear
is that he won't have the memory.''
   On that topic, he is emboldened by the recent return to the
stage, after a decade away, of his friend and mentor, Sir John
Gielgud, in the new play ``The Best of Friends.''
   ``Gielgud is 83,'' Guinness says matter-of-factly, ``and he got
through it (the play) very successfully.''
   By now, the sky has clouded over, and rain looks likely.
Guinness has a lunch date for which he mustn't be late, so he
returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived.
   ``There they are,'' he says, sounding resigned as the anonymity
of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans' ever-ready pens and
cameras.
   But before leaving the zoo, he has one last remark about rhinos:
``We're told they have very nice personalities.''
   He takes an inimitable pause. ``But I don't think I'd like to
encounter them intimately.''

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., the
storied producer of such movies as ``Ghostbusters'' and TV hits
like ``Who's The Boss,'' agreed Wednesday to a $3.4 billion cash
buyout by Sony Corp.
   The deal comes 21 months after the huge Japanese video and audio
equipment maker bought CBS Records for $2 billion. It marks the
biggest step of Sony's push into the ``software'' side of the
entertainment business that will provide products such as movies
and records to complement its stereos, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   The agreement also extends the recent trend of foreign buyouts
of Hollywood studios that has gobbled up MGM-UA Entertainment Co.
and 20th Century Fox.
   Sony said it intended to allow Columbia's U.S. management
independence in day-to-day operations, but some top-level changes
are expected.
   Columbia said its president and chief executive, Victor A.
Kaufman, and its chief operating officer, Lew Korman, intend to
resign on completion of the buyout.
   There were published reports that movie producer Peter Guber was
expected to replace Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,''
``Rainman,'' and ``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's
top producers.
   The deal should provide a big payday for Coca-Cola Co., which
stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from selling its
49 percent stake in Columbia under Sony's $27 a share offer.
Coca-Cola signed an option agreement with Sony to tender its nearly
54 million shares of Columbia stock, subject to approval by
Coca-Cola's board, which is expected to meet Monday. The investment
firm Allen &amp; Co. Inc. signed an option agreement to sell its 3
percent stake.
   Coca-Cola declined comment on what it intends to do with the
cash, but analysts speculated that it would reinvest in its
soft-drink operations and possibly repurchase some of its stock.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia rose 25
cents a share at $26.50 while Coca-Cola rose 50 cents a share to
$64.62{.
   Sony reportedly has been looking for a movie studio for more
than a year in an effort to extend its reach into new areas of the
entertainment business that it already serves as a dominant maker
of consumer electronics.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
he had held informal discusssions with Columbia executives for
about a year but that the talks got serious only in the past week.
He said Sony decided on a proposal this past weekend and presented
it on Monday.
   Sony's U.S. subsidiary, Sony USA Inc., intends to launch its
tender offer by next Tuesday and expects to complete the
acquisition by early November.
   The deal had been widely rumored since Monday, when Columbia
disclosed it was in buyout talks with a third party that it refused
to identify. Sony confirmed early Wednesday from Tokyo that it had
made an offer.
   Columbia Chairman Donald R. Keough, who also is president of
Coca-Cola, said Sony was ``an ideal buyer.''
   ``It has all the right characteristics and very importantly has
the ability to take the company to its next important step,'' he
said.
   Columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major
Hollywood force, placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic
box-office revenues through Sept. 4, according to the trade journal
Variety.
   Its owns two film studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star
Pictures, but its box-office results have been considered
disappointing in recent years. Among its most recent releases have
been ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid Part III'' and
``Casualties of War.''
   It has been more impressive in television, where it has produced
or distributed 11 prime-time series, including five new shows.
   Coca-Cola has been involved in Columbia since 1982, when it
bought a predecessor company. Coca-Cola subsequently launched a new
studio called Tri-Star Pictures in a joint venture with CBS Inc.
and Home Box Office Inc.
   In late 1987, Coca-Cola merged its entertainment business with
Tri-Star and wound up with 80 percent of the company that was
called Columbia Pictures Entertainmment. It subsequently
distributed part of its interest in Columbia to Coca-Cola
shareholders and retained 49 percent.
   In its statement, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive,
Roberto Goizueta, said Coca-Cola shareholders ``have benefited
significantly from our investment in the entertainment business
during the decade of the '80s.''
   But he said the company's ``core soft drink business offers
unequaled opportunity to expand our global leadership'' in the
1990s.
   Analysts said Columbia's huge library of more than 2,700 films
and more than 23,000 TV episodes should prove valuable to Sony.
   In the Columbia library are such films such as ``On the
Waterfront,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Bridge over the River
Kwai,'' ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Tootsie.'' Tri-Star films have
included ``The Natural'' and ``Rambo: First Blood Part II.''
   Its TV programs include ``Designing Women'' and ``Married ...
With Children'' as well as syndicated programs such as ``The
Jeffersons'' and ``Barney Miller.'' Its TV library includes the
series ``Father Knows Best'' and ``Route 66.''
   Columbia also operates 820 movie screens in 220 locations
through its Loews Theatre Management Corp.
   Columbia earned $16 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of
$1.62 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.

   Gerald Wallace, younger brother of
former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, was fined $100,000 Friday
and given a suspended two-year prison sentence for income tax
evasion.
   He also was placed on five years' probation.
   Wallace, 68, a once influential lawyer who is suffering from
cancer, pleaded guilty in October to two counts of failing to
report $165,195 in federal taxes for 1984 and 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina ordered Wallace to pay the first
$20,000 of the fine by the end of March and the rest within five
years, though he doubted Wallace would be able to repay the full
amount.
   ``I have heard you are the most powerful man in Alabama,'' the
judge said. ``I don't know if that is true, but it is a tragedy to
see you before me.''

   Will Steger and five fellow adventurers
who completed a seven-month, 3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on
skis and dogsleds said they had a hair-raising time getting off the
frozen continent.
   Lifeboats carrying the team to a waiting Soviet ship at Mirnyy
on the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica had to dodge ice floes when
an iceberg split apart Thursday.
   ``The most dangerous part of the expedition was getting here and
getting out,'' Steger said from Mirnyy. ``Thank God we didn't lose
anyone.''
   The six men, 29 sled dogs, two dog handlers and 13 journalists
were loaded by ropes down a steep, icy embankment into the
lifeboats. For the mushers, it was their first time off the ice
since arriving by Soviet airplane at King George Island on the
continent's western tip last July.
   Steger, who is from the Minnesota town of Ely, was a co-leader
of the St. Paul-based expedition.

   Sir David Lean, the 81-year-old
director whose films have won 27 Academy Awards, says his ``Life
Achievement Award'' from the American Film Institute took him by
surprise.
   Lean, director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the River
Kwai'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' said he never thought of himself
``as anything so special.''
   But actors and directors including Anjelica Huston, Martin
Scorsese, Gene Kelly and Gregory Peck were fulsome in their praise
at Thursday night's tribute.
   Lean chuckled through it all. If anybody had told him when he
started in the business that he was going to be a director, he
said, ``I would think they were mad.''
   Previous winners include Peck, Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, John Huston
and Alfred Hitchcock.

   Attorneys for comedian Bill Cosby and his
wife, Camille, pressed a judge for an early start to the bankruptcy
trial of the couple's fired business manager.
   They said they wanted to prevent her from depleting assets
estimated at $10 million.
   Cosby, once called ``the richest man in show business'' by
Forbes Magazine, claims Mary Waller cheated him out of more than
$8.5 million, court records show.
   After heated arguments Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur
Greenwald ordered attorneys to return Tuesday, when he would decide
the trial date.
   The lawyers are arguing whether fraud and embezzlement
allegations brought by the Cosbys merit an early trial.
   The trial will decide whether Ms. Waller can manage her own
assets while she reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, or whether her estate should be placed under a
court-appointed trustee.
   Ms. Waller, 46, recently filed for bankruptcy protection after
eight years serving as chief financial officer to the Cosbys.
   She was earning $1 million annually when fired in July,
according to the Cosbys. Cosby says Ms. Waller misspent millions of
the couple's money, buying among other things, a $44,551 Range
Rover automobile and $28,610 in jewelry.
   She denies the allegations.

   A ranch owned by actress Greer Garson would
become a national park under a bill introduced in Congress by three
New Mexico lawmakers.
   Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici and Rep. Bill Richardson
said the bill introduced Thursday would allow the National Park
Service to preserve and interpret the history of the entire Pecos
area near Las Vegas, N.M.
   The planned Pecos National Historical Park would stand on what
is now the 5,865-acre Forked Lightning Ranch owned by Ms. Garson.
It would include the 25-year-old Pecos National Monument, which
includes a village dating from the Pecos Pueblo Indians of 1450,
the lawmakers said.
   ``The many prehistoric and historic resources located on the
Forked Lightning Ranch would add significantly to the Pecos
National Park,'' Richardson said.
   Negotiations were under way for the land, which may be purchased
by a third party and then donated to the federal government, he
said. Under the legislation, land may be bought, exchanged or
donated.
   Ms. Garson recently halted negotiations to sell the land to a
developer after learning of its plans to create a resort.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Epic Restored For Re-Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-six years after the premiere of ``Lawrence
of Arabia,'' the Oscar-winning epic will be re-released with scenes
that had been cut from the original and a new look and sound created
by a $600,000 restoration.
   The re-edited ``Lawrence'' will be just as its director, David
Lean, intended.
   ```Lawrence of Arabia' was the first film I saw that made me want
to be a moviemaker,'' said director Steven Spielberg, a co-chairman
of the American Film Institute's National Center for Film and Video
Preservation.
   The film institute and Columbia Pictures announced the re-release
on Wednesday.
   The center will receive proceeds from a series of benefits at
which the restored film will premiere: Feb. 4 in New York, Feb. 5 in
Washington and Feb. 12 in Los Angeles.
   The 2{ years of work done on ``Lawrence of Arabia'' were ``the
most expensive, extensive and difficult film restoration ever
attempted,'' said Robert A. Harris, an archivist who conducted the
restoration for the institute.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' won Academy Awards for best picture,
director, color cinematography, color art direction, sound, editing
and music, but Lean's original editing plan was not followed in the
rush to get the movie ready in 1962.
   Lean, 80, rerecorded lost parts of the original sound track with
Peter O'Toole, who starred as T.E. Lawrence, and Alec Guinness, who
played King Faisal. New lines were added. Missing ones were redubbed.
   ``All of their voices have mellowed,'' Harris said, ``and so we
had to change the harmonics by using computers.''
   Existing prints of the film were in terrible shape, said Dawn
Steel, president of Columbia Pictures. She and filmmaker Martin
Scorsese are chairmen of the institute's film-preservation fund.
   ``Parts of the film had been cut and lost, and the color was
appalling,'' Steel said. ``But now the film looks brand new. The
color is perfect, and it's the cut that David Lean wanted.''

   BUSH SAID the U.S. and its allies would establish refugee
camps in northern Iraq.
   The president announced that U.S. troops would help create
the encampments in an effort to hasten humanitarian
assistance to tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees. Bush
said the Kurds would be encouraged to move to the protected
camps from remote mountainous areas along Iraq's borders with
Turkey and Iran. He stressed that the action was "an interim
measure designed to meet an immediate, penetrating
humanitarian need," and that the U.S. hadn't any intention of
intervening militarily in Iraq's internal affairs.

   THE SUPREME COURT MADE it tougher for death-row inmates to
appeal.
   The high court, by a 6-3 vote, narrowed the rights of
convicted criminals, especially those on death row, to file
repeated challenges to the constitutionality of their
convictions. The justices ruled that a Georgia inmate abused
the legal process known as habeas corpus by filing a second
round of legal challenges to his 1978 murder conviction.
Conservatives have complained that prisoners drag out death
sentences by filing habeas corpus petitions rehashing old
issues or raising new ones that could have been raised
earlier.
   The dissenters, Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens, accused
the court of substituting its own rules for those of Congress
with regard to defendants' rights without acknowledging the
change.

   Laurence Olivier led a troupe of knights and dames
who had illustrious stage and screen careers, and his special status
was enhanced when he gained the title of baron.
   Olivier, who died Tuesday, was knighted in 1947 and elevated in
1970 to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. The title gave him a
seat in the House of Lords, which along with the House of Commons
constitutes Britain's Parliament. The only other theatrical peer is
actor and theater founder Bernard Miles.
   The first actor to be knighted was Henry Irving, so honored by
Queen Victoria in 1895. Ellen Terry, his leading lady in a
partnership that dominated the London stage for 25 years, was made a
dame in 1925.
   The honors gave the profession respectability and helped
eliminate the remains of a puritan prejudice against actors.
   Actors have continued to appear on the annual Honors Lists
announced by Buckingham Palace.
   Donald Wolfit, one of this century's great actor-managers, was
knighted in 1957.
   Noel Coward, the actor and playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and
``Blithe Spirit,'' was knighted in 1970 and actor Rex Harrison was
so honored this year.
   Among the other actor-knights no longer living are Ralph
Richardson, the ebullient, eccentric actor who regularly appeared
alongside Olivier and John Gielgud, who was knighted after World War
II.
   Michael Redgrave became patriarch of an acting dynasty whose
scions include Vanessa Redgrave and her daughters, Natasha and Joely
Richardson.
   Sybil Thorndike was made a dame in 1931 in the midst of a long
and illustrious career in Shakespearean roles. Many of her later
roles were played opposite her husband, actor-director Lewis Casson,
who was knighted in 1945.
   Other great dames have included Edith Evans, the peppery comic
actress best known as Lady Bracknell in ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' and Gladys Cooper, the fragile star who last appeared on
the New York and London stages in Enid Bagnold's ``The Chalk
Garden'' more than 30 years ago.
   Many actor-knights work regularly despite advancing years.
   The 85-year-old Gielgud won a 1981 Oscar for ``Arthur,'' and was
seen on the West End stage in early 1988 in Hugh Whitemore's ``The
Best of Friends.''
   Peggy Ashcroft, 81, graduated with Olivier in 1925 from London's
Central School of Speech and Drama. She was a mainstay of the London
stage throughout her career, but found international fame after
almost 60 years with her performances in ``A Passage To India'' on
film and ``The Jewel In the Crown'' on television.
   Wendy Hiller at 76 undertook a six-month London run in ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.
   Alec Guinness, known internationally for such classic films as
``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and ``Tunes of Glory,'' was
knighted in 1959.
   More recently he became known to new audiences as Obi-Wan Kenobi
in 1977's ``Star Wars,'' and as John Le Carre's self-effacing spy
George Smiley on television. Guinness' 1988 starring role in the
American play ``A Walk In the Woods'' was his first London stage
work in 10 years.
   Judi Dench, the latest dame, was honored in 1988 after a string
of critically acclaimed performances. She made her debut as a
director this year, winning praise for her production of
Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.''

FT  11 SEP 93 / Travel: The other face of the mystic orient - South-east
Asia / Victor Mallet rides the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEONE has to say it. South-east Asia in the 1990s is about as exotic and
mysterious as Margate in winter, writes Victor Mallet. This became clear to
me as I approached the inner sanctum of the ancient temple of Angkor Wat in
Cambodia. I was ready to be awe-struck. I was not ready for the electronic
burbling noises: a Khmer woman seated on a wall was concentrating
ferociously as she played her hand-held 'Game Boy.'
Over in Borneo, my climb to the top of Mt Kinabalu, the highest mountain in
south-east Asia, was marred by the unwanted company of two coachloads of
Koreans. It is hardly surprising that the Kinabalu friendly warbler which
hopped about happily at the feet of the first climbers in the middle of the
last century is now not very friendly and rarely seen. My certificate
suggests that I am at least the 72,406th person to have reached the peak.
In south-east Asia, people spend much of their time buying things in
shopping malls, sitting in traffic jams and watching soap operas on
television. Forests are cut down to make way for condominiums. Hills are
demolished and taken away to be used as cement for motorways and
skyscrapers.
So you can ignore all the obligatory guff about (I quote) 'the exotic and
mysterious east' in the brochures published by the new Eastern &amp; Oriental
Express train company. Thailand may be 'a land of water lilies, bright green
rice fields and swaying palm trees,' but it is also a country of polluted
rivers, urban sprawl and probably the ugliest capital city in the world.
As for the southern town of Hat Yai - 'a commercial centre known for its
naughty night-life' - it is a concrete jungle full of seedy brothels for
visiting Malaysians.
Not that south-east Asia is dull; nor is it uniform. In the course of a
42-hour, 1,943-kilometre journey up the Malayan peninsula, the E &amp; O can
transport you in great luxury from order to chaos - from Singapore, in other
words, to Bangkok by way of Kuala Lumpur. Each of the three countries on the
route is undergoing an economic boom. But each has chosen to handle its good
fortune in a different way.
Singapore believes in discipline and control. Everything works. The airport
functions so smoothly, and passengers are whisked away so promptly, that you
wonder where everybody is when you first fly in.
Chewing gum is banned because it is messy and it used to interfere with the
closing of the doors on the subway trains. Citizens are urged in government
advertising campaigns to be polite, flush the toilets and have more babies.
They generally obey. Managers of high-rise hotels forbid you to open the
window of your room. Information is restricted.
Thailand is the opposite. It is undisciplined and chaotic. Traffic jams are
so nightmarish that the government advised people last year to carry
provisions and portable toilets in their cars.
There are hundreds of laws, but few people obey them. Prostitution is
illegal and even the mildest love scenes are censored at the movies. But you
can walk out of the cinema into a brothel owned by the police, or
participate (if you wish) in a live sex show.
Armed with this information, you can settle down in the bar of the E &amp; O
express with a beer - or a Dollars 180 bottle of Dom Perignon - and engage
in the debate that often dominates expatriate conversations in south-east
Asia: which is better, Bangkok or Singapore?
The arguments can be passionate. Residents of Singapore are torn between
praising the island's convenience and cleanliness on the one hand, and
claiming, on the other, that it is much more interesting than it seems. In
support of the latter line of thought, a commodity broker once told me how
his boss, visiting from London, died in his hotel room after being drugged
and robbed by a transvestite prostitute.
Bangkok loyalists are equally ambivalent. They abhor the pollution and
corruption of Thailand, but regard Singapore as impossibly humourless and
sterile, a sort of shiny Swiss hospital parked in the tropics. (Kuala
Lumpur, psychologically as well as geographically, comes somewhere in
between).
What all of south-east Asia has in common is the urge to make money. The
leisurely, nostalgic journey on the E &amp; O, with its wood-panelled interior
inspired by the 1932 film Shanghai Express, is aimed more at the visitor
than at local tycoons.
Among those who most enjoyed the trip I took were a wealthy tourist couple
from New Zealand and a pair of Surbiton teachers on honeymoon. Meanwhile,
the managing director of a Thai company had a habit of rushing to the
observation car at the back of the train with his short-wave radio to find
out the yen/dollar rate. Fun for some, perhaps, but hardly exotic.
Victor Mallet was a guest of Eastern &amp; Oriental Express, a sister of the
Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. Address: Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London SE1 9PF, tel: (071)-928-6000, fax: (071)-620-1210. The train
travels each way between Singapore and Bangkok once a week. Passengers can
board or alight at other main stations on the way. Excursions are also
planned to places such as Malacca in Malaysia and Kanchanaburi, the site of
the Death Railway's bridge over the river Kwai in Thailand.
Fares start at Pounds 740 per person for a sleeping compartment and meals
one way between Singapore and Bangkok. Single occupancy supplement: Pounds
370 for sleeping compartments. State compartments cost Pounds 1,020 per
person (single supp Pounds 510).

   If the Academy Award race for supporting actor
goes according to form, the winner would be Alec Guinness for
``Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say.
   After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work:
Don Ameche, ``Cocoon,'' 1985; Michael Caine, ``Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' 1986; Sean Connery, ``The Untouchables,'' 1987.
   The trouble is that Academy Award voters don't always follow
tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the
six hours of ``Little Dorrit.''
   The British-made film is based on Charles Dickens' last, often
overlooked novel. Guinness, Oscar winner as best actor for ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as William Dorrit,
longtime resident of debtors' prison.
   ``The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the
74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, ``because in many ways
it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to
kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him
because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into
prison for 20-odd years for debt.''
   But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's
Martin Landau, nominated for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' For
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such
as ``North by Northwest, ``Cleopatra'' and ``Nevada Smith,'' though
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.''
   Francis Coppola gave Landau the role of his life as Abe Karatz,
financial adviser to car builder Preston Tucker. Of Coppola, Landau,
54, remarks: ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you,
that's a vote of confidence. Francis really creates a background for
you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Landau is a director of the Actors Studio in Hollywood, and he
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News, he drew portraits of Abe
and analyzed him as ``a lonely New York businessman who really has
no family, no friends and no life outside work.''
   Then there's Dean Stockwell, nominated as the outrageous Mafia
don in ``Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52
years. The son of singer Harry Stockwell, Dean was a child actor in
such films as ``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``The Boy With the Green Hair.''
   His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after
his child-star days; success as a young man in ``Compulsion,''
``Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during
the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act,
but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, Joy,
moved to Santa Fe, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him.
   Stockwell credits director Jonathan Demme for taking a chance on
him in ``Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: ``No one had ever
thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid
of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and
neurotics and sensitive people.''
   Kevin Kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious
underworld type in ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Known for his flamboyant
roles in the theater, Kline, 41, has created a series of indelible
performances on the screen: as Meryl Streep's erratic lover in
``Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in ``The Big Chill'';
the swashbuckling buccaneer in ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   The actor believes that his screen potential hasn't been reached:
``I've done tons of roles on the stage that I haven't even
approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd
like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures,
comedies. No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that
way.''
   The youngest nominee is 18-year-old River Phoenix, named for his
``Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the
run from the FBI. Phoenix has established himself as one of the
screen's best young actors in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Mosquito Coast'' and ``Little Nikita.''
   As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the
move, Phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in
``Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing
was good training for acting.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''

   But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's
Martin Landau, nominated for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' For
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such
as ``North by Northwest, ``Cleopatra'' and ``Nevada Smith,'' though
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.''
   Francis Coppola gave Landau the role of his life as Abe Karatz,
financial adviser to car builder Preston Tucker. Of Coppola, Landau,
54, remarks: ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you,
that's a vote of confidence. Francis really creates a background for
you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Landau is a director of the Actors Studio in Hollywood, and he
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News, he drew portraits of Abe
and analyzed him as ``a lonely New York businessman who really has
no family, no friends and no life outside work.''
   Then there's Dean Stockwell, nominated as the outrageous Mafia
don in ``Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52
years. The son of singer Harry Stockwell, Dean was a child actor in
such films as ``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``The Boy With the Green Hair.''
   His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after
his child-star days; success as a young man in ``Compulsion,''
``Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during
the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act,
but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, Joy,
moved to Santa Fe, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him.
   Stockwell credits director Jonathan Demme for taking a chance on
him in ``Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: ``No one had ever
thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid
of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and
neurotics and sensitive people.''
   Kevin Kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious
underworld type in ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Known for his flamboyant
roles in the theater, Kline, 41, has created a series of indelible
performances on the screen: as Meryl Streep's erratic lover in
``Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in ``The Big Chill'';
the swashbuckling buccaneer in ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   The actor believes that his screen potential hasn't been reached:
``I've done tons of roles on the stage that I haven't even
approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd
like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures,
comedies. No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that
way.''
   The youngest nominee is 18-year-old River Phoenix, named for his
``Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the
run from the FBI. Phoenix has established himself as one of the
screen's best young actors in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Mosquito Coast'' and ``Little Nikita.''
   As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the
move, Phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in
``Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing
was good training for acting.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''

RESTORED 'LAWRENCE' CONQUERS NEW YORK PREMIERE AUDIENCE

<P>
A capacity crowd braved freezing temperatures here Saturday night to bask in 
the sun-scorched glories of the kind of film making that Hollywood doesn't do 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie premiere for the newly restored "Lawrence of Arabia" culminated 
an epic struggle to locate, repair and re-edit footage that began disappearing 
within weeks of the film's initial release, back in December, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three premieres marking the film's re-release. Sunday's 
Washington premiere was held at the Cineplex Odeon Circle Avalon Theater. And 
the Los Angeles premiere will be held Sunday at the Cineplex Odeon Century 
Plaza, where the film officially opens Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hacked-away over the years, first so that exhibitors could squeeze in more 
screenings, then so that television could squeeze the movie into a time slot 
(and squeeze its sprawling 70-millimeter images into a TV format), "Lawrence" 
-- winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture -- acquired a kind of 
legend through the years, becoming a cause celebre among film 
historians/lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The thunder of applause that greeted the film's latest adventure would seem to 
signify that the saga of T. E. Lawrence, the unlikely hero who helped to unite 
Arab tribesmen in their battles against the Turks, is once again off and 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
Restored to director Sir David Lean's original cut, the 3-hour, 40-minute 
"Lawrence" mesmerized the crowd that filled the more than 1,200 seats of the 
Art Deco-studded Ziegfeld Theater on West 54th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the night's excitement: the presence of Lean himself, and his two 
once-unknown stars, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were Oscar-winning editor Anne V. Coates (who wore a purple, 
rhinestone-studded Middle Eastern caftan "especially for the occasion") and 
Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young. 
</P>
<P>
The night's other VIPs included Robert A. Harris and Jim Painten, producers of 
the restoration; film makers/restoration-preservation advocates Martin Scorsese 
and Steven Spielberg; and Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel. (It was 
Scorsese and Spielberg who convinced Steel that the studio should back the 
restoration.) 
</P>
<P>
For O'Toole, the night marked the opportunity to "see my old chums again." 
(With understated aplomb, O'Toole said, "This is all awfully nice.") 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to yesterday's epic motion pictures, O'Toole added, "We'd make them 
tomorrow if we could." He smiled at Sharif as he quipped, "Just think -- if we 
did 'Lawrence' again, I could play the Alec Guinness part and he could play 
Tony Quinn's role." 
</P>
<P>
For Sharif, it was his first "Lawrence" screening since 1962. "I can still 
remember that very first premiere in 1962. Then I was so nervous. I had no way 
of knowing how the audience would react. Would they like the picture? Would 
they like me?" 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm seeing an old friend I haven't seen for a long, long time," 
said a jubilant Lean. The seriousness of the night was echoed by Scorsese and 
Spielberg. Said Scorsese: "This is not a film that was made in 1925. It's not a 
movie no one has ever heard of. This film is a legend. It won Oscars. It has 
stars who have become household names. And there are moments from this film 
that people associate with those stars." He sighed: "That a movie like 
'Lawrence' could have deteriorated so quickly. That is truly alarming." 
</P>
<P>
American Film Institute director Jean Firstenberg introduced the "Lawrence" 
participants as they lined up in front of the theater's massive gold curtains. 
"We are in the midst of film history tonight," she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Underwritten by Columbia, the film's three premieres will benefit the AFI's 
film preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrence" will play only New York, Washington and Los Angeles to begin with. 
The reason: prints are costly (just under $40,000 each) and few modern theaters 
are capable of showing a film of "Lawrence's" wide-screen scope. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder then that Lean created a stir among the Ziegfeld audience when he 
kicked off the screening by looking at the theater's massive screen, and 
proclaimed: "This is what the movies should be shown on." 
</P>
<P>
That said, the overture began. (The film's stirring score earned Maurice Jarre 
an Academy Award.) So did the applause. It grew thunderous when Lean's name 
appeared. There was applause, too, for the stars' credits -- as well as an 
audible gasp when the words "And introducing Peter O'Toole" appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lawrence" celebration continued later that night, as a crowd of 600 (who 
had paid $250 to $1,000 a ticket) gathered for a dinner in the Grand Ballroom 
of the Pierre Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of starry names among the crowd, including Sylvester Stallone, 
Christopher Reeve, Jane Alexander and Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mets' first baseman Keith Hernandez was there, too -- signing 
autographs and searching for some himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying his 1962 souvenir "Lawrence" movie program, Hernandez worked the room 
getting the movie's cast and crew to sign it. "I got it when I first saw the 
film. I was about 9. I never, ever forgot it," said Hernandez. "I couldn't wait 
to see this movie again." 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrencemania" also struck Manhattan Beach attorney Rick Lesser, who came with 
his 5-year-old son, Ricky (who wore a little tux). "I spent $250 a ticket -- 
and Ricky isn't subbing for anyone," Lesser said. "I really wanted him to be a 
part of this night. I still remember the first time I saw 'Lawrence.' It was 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
As for what the movie magic means to the modern studio executive, Dawn Steel 
was upfront: "I'm not about to compare 'Lawrence' with any of our other 
(upcoming) titles. That wouldn't be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steel: "With this movie, you're talking about perfection -- or as close 
to it as you can get. You just don't get better than David Lean."

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it is paying for the right to show 1,000 feature films
owned by Columbia Pictures Television Inc. on its two cable
stations.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   The film library, which includes a variety of movies dating from
1935 to 1983, would be shown on Turner Network Television and
SuperStation WTBS.
   ``This package contains just the right mix of action-oriented
films and popular comedies to support TBS' continued growth in the
1990s,'' said Bob Levi, a TBS executive vice president.
   The library is licensed for a two-year period that begins in
January and is subject to renewal.
   TNT and TBS will share rights to the titles, but company
officials said the majority of the films will air on TNT, Turner's
mostly-movie channel.
   Among the titles in the package are ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
``Tootsie,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Turner's film library already includes the pre-1986 MGM films,
pre-1950 Warner Brothers films and a number of RKO titles.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.'s
$3.4 billion purchase by Japan's Sony Corp. adds another chapter to
the up-and-down history of a scrappy little studio that rose from
Poverty Row to become a major force in Hollywood.
   For Sony, the deal announced Wednesday means another big
foothold in the U.S. entertainment industry for the giant
electronics manufacturer.
   Sony, which bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year, has
been seeking properties that will provide the records and movies it
hopes consumers will use with its stereos and videocassette
recorders.
   Columbia's attractiveness stems from its successful stable of
television productions, as well as the storied studio responsible
for such movies as ``It Happened One Night,'' ``On The Waterfront''
and ``Ghostbusters.''
   Columbia's rise was led by bombastic founder Harry Cohn, dubbed
``White Fang'' by writer Ben Hecht. Commenting on Cohn's
well-attended funeral in 1958, Red Skelton cracked on his
television show: ``It only proves that if you give the people what
they want, they'll turn out for it.''
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The quality of their initial films prompted the movie trade
to call the company Corned Beef and Cabbage; the founders changed
the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn operated a tiny studio on Hollywood's Poverty Row
alongside other shoestring producers. Columbia's growth accelerated
with the advent of Frank Capra in 1928, during which he directed
seven films. Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened
One Night,'' ``Lost Horizon,'' ``Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'' and ``You
Can't Take it with You,'' _ helped establish Columbia as a major
studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the Thirties and Forties _ ``One Night of
Love,'' ``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``Gilda,''
``The Jolson Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among
the Columbia stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden,
Kim Novak, Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn broke Hollywood's opposition to television and
formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV series. The film
division continued to thrive with such hits as ``Born Yesterday,''
``From Here to Eternity,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``The Caine
Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The death of Harry Cohn in 1958 coincided with the end of the
big-studio era. Columbia became host to a number of independent
producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence of Arabia''), Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''), Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''), Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''), Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'') and Mike Frankovich
(``Cactus Flower'').
   Once located in the heart of Hollywood, Columbia sold its famous
Sunset and Gower studios in the late 1960s and moved production
facilities to The Burbank Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros.
   Columbia's unsteady course continued during the 1970s and in
1982 it was acquired by Coca-Cola Co. The marriage between the
soft-drink empire and the entertainment company worked for a time.
   Thanks largely to ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid,''
Columbia's share of the 1984 box-office receipts was 21 percent.
Another Coca-Cola subsidiary, Tri-Star Pictures, claimed 5.3
percent of domestic theater admissions. Warner Bros. had 23 percent
and Paramount 22.6 percent that year.
   But despite Coca-Cola's attempts to inject its production and
marketing techniques into the movie business, its film divisions
declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and Columbia
sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   Columbia's stability also was undermined by unsteady management.
The studio had a parade of bosses, including David Begelman, who
was deposed in an embezzlement scandal;, Francis (Fay) Vincent, who
now is commissioner of major league baseball; Frank Price and David
Puttnam, producer of ``Chariots of Fire'' and ``The Killing
Fields.''
   After taking over Columbia in late 1986, Puttnam said he
wouldn't follow the Hollywood establishment trend toward bigger
budgets and higher salaries for stars. The stand quickly alienated
powerful producers, directors, actors and talent agents, including
actor Bill Murray, director Norman Jewison, producers Ray Stark and
Martin Ransohoff and the Creative Artists Agency.
   After less than a year, Puttnam he was replaced by movie
producer Dawn Steel.
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part of its interest to Coca-Cola
shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest chains, with more than 800 screens in 220
locations.
   While Columbia's television division, boosted by such shows as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' flourished,
its motion-picture arm drifted. Steel has relied on a variety of
projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid III'' and
``Casualties of War,'' none of which have been runaway hits.
``Casualties of War'' has been a box-office bomb.

   Until this week, ``Who's the Boss?'' simply
identified one of the more popular television shows from Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   But in the wake of Columbia's agreement to a $3.4 billion cash
buyout by Sony Corp., it is a valid question for one of Hollywood's
biggest film and television production companies.
   Columbia said Wednesday that its president and chief executive,
Victor A. Kaufman, and its chief operating officer, Lew Korman,
intend to resign on completion of the buyout, which the company
expects will be in November.
   Sony executives privately confirmed they were courting movie
producer Peter Guber for a major role at the company.
   Early today, Guber's production company, Guber-Peters
Entertainment Co., announced it agreed to be acquired by Sony USA
for $17.50 a share, or about $200 million.
   Published reports said Guber was being recruited to replace
Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,'' ``Rain Man,'' and
``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's top producers.
   But spokesmen for Sony and Columbia each declined comment on
whether Sony's agreement to buy the company meant Guber would take
Kaufman's place.
   Sony issued a statement saying, ``We will not comment on the
terms of the merger agreement which will be made a matter of public
record in due course.''
   Once the management issues are resolved, Sony said, it intends
to place day-to-day operation of Columbia Pictures in the hands of
U.S. management just as it has done with its previous big U.S.
entertainment acquisition, CBS Records.
   The deal for Columbia comes nearly two years after the huge
Japanese video and audio equipment maker bought CBS Records for $2
billion.
   It marks the biggest step of Sony's push into the ``software''
side of the entertainment business that will provide products such
as movies and records to complement its stereos, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   Christopher Dixon, entertainment industry analyst for the
investment firm Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., called it ``an opportunistic
purchase'' for Sony that will likely look even better a few years
from now.
   He said Sony learned from its experience with CBS Records that
owning a company that produces software can help insure the
popularity of new technological gadgets, such as compact disk
players.
   Owning a film and television production company could come in
handy as Sony introduces new types of playback devices, Dixon said.
It also could give Sony its own sounding board in the professional
community that could help in its development of equipment needed to
produce shows for high-definition TV sets.
   Dixon said the company's experience with CBS Records also may
have taught Sony about the potential of the video market outside
the United States.
   And finally, he said, Sony recognizes that the number of
companies with film and TV libraries the size Columbia's are
shrinking.
   Companies with Hollywood studios, including Warner
Communications Inc., MGM-UA Entertainment Co. and 20th Century Fox,
have been acquired recently.
   Columbia owns more than 2,700 movies, including classics such as
``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' as
well as the more recent ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid.''
   Its 23,000 TV episodes include the prime-time shows ``Designing
Women'' and ``Married ... With Children,'' the syndicated ``Barney
Miller'' and the classic ``Father Knows Best.''
   Sony plans to launch a tender offer of $27 a share for all of
Columbia's stock Tuesday, but already has option agreements for
more than half of Columbia's shares at that price, including the 49
percent held by Coca-Cola Co. and about 3 percent held by the
investment firm Allen &amp; Co. Inc.
   Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from
selling its nearly 54 million Columbia shares to Sony, subject to
approval by Coca-Cola's board. The board meets Monday.
   The Atlanta-based company declined to comment on what it intends
to do with the cash, but analysts speculated that it would invest
in its soft-drink operations overseas and possibly repurchase some
of its stock.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia
rose 25 cents a share to closet at $26.50, while Coca-Cola rose 50
cents a share to $64.62{.
   Stephen A. Schwarzman, president and chief executive of The
Blackstone Group, which advised Sony, said Sony had been looking at
various Hollywood companies for more than a year.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
talks with Columbia became serious only in the past week. He said
Sony decided to make a proposal over last weekend and presented it
to Columbia's board Monday.
   Columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major
Hollywood force, placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic
box-office revenues through Sept. 4, according to the trade journal
Variety.
   Its owns two film studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star
Pictures, the television production companies Columbia Pictures
Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises, and operates 820 motion
picture screens in 220 locations.

<HEAD>Sir John Mills At 80: Tributes To A Trouper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir John Mills, the elegant British actor who won
an Oscar in 1970 for his role as a hunchback in ``Ryan's
Daughter,'' turns 80 Monday with tributes from fans and colleagues
in a country that takes its leading men seriously.
   The actor, whose career has spanned 55 years and more than 120
films and plays, is being feted with honorific articles and film
retrospectives.
   ``His great achievement has been to show the qualities of
English decency operating at every level of society,'' wrote
Jeffrey Richards in The Daily Telegraph in an appreciation entitled
``The English Everyman.''
   Sir Richard Attenborough, the Academy Award-winning director of
``Gandhi'' and a longtime friend and colleague, said Mills ``gave
film acting in England an integrity and a stature that nobody else
did precisely in that way.''
   In a TV program, ``John Mills: 80 Years On,'' aired Friday by
the British Broadcasting Corp., Attenborough said Mills possessed
``the image and the charisma of a major movie star who is
essentially an indigenous movie star. ... He belongs to his own
country and epitomizes his own country.''
   In the same program, Mills tells interviewer Christopher
Frayling of his particular affection for Britain.
   ``I'm mad about the country. I really like it. I've been all
over the world, everywhere, (but) ... I'm always absolutely
delighted to come home,'' said Mills, who was knighted by Queen
Elizabeth II in 1976.
   These are appropriate sentiments for an actor whose career
embraces such classic British films as ``In Which We Serve'' in
1942, Noel Coward and David Lean's stirring war movie; Lean's
``Great Expectations'' in 1946; Bryan Forbes' ``The Wrong Box'' in
1966; and Attenborough's own ``Oh, What A Lovely War'' in 1969.
   Many of the films are featured in a 10-week retrospective
beginning Sunday on BBC TV, and a 20-film series at the National
Film Theater that culminates Feb. 28 with a lecture by the actor.
   Despite his screen acclaim playing archetypically British
military servicemen alongside a variety of character parts, Mills
began his career as a theatrical song-and-dance man in the chorus
line of ``The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the London Hippodrome in 1929.
   By the early 1930s, he was appearing in Noel Coward's lavish
``Cavalcade'' and in his 1932 ``Words and Music.''
   His first screen role was as a hoofing midshipman opposite
Jessie Matthews in ``The Midshipmaid'' in 1932, but his first
significant part was in the World War I naval adventure movie,
``Brown On Resolution'' in 1935.
   The 1930s and '40s saw his burgeoning professional relationships
with Noel Coward and David Lean, as well as the beginning of his
friendship with Attenborough, his co-star in ``In Which They
Serve'' and his director on three different movies: ``Lovely War,''
``Young Winston,'' and ``Gandhi.''
   In 1941, Mills married the playwright and former actress Mary
Hayley Bell. They have three children, two of whom _ Hayley and
Juliet _ are noted actresses.
   ``They're both awfully good,'' Mills said.
   In 1970, the actor, known for his deftness with accents, won an
Oscar for best supporting actor playing the mute village idiot,
Michael, in ``Ryan's Daughter.''
   ``It was weird,'' he joked. ``I just thought I'd been wasting my
time for the past 55 years learning all these millions of lines,
and then getting an Oscar for not speaking.''
   In 1980, he wrote his autobiography, ``Up in the Clouds,
Gentlemen Please,'' and he has recently revived his stage career.
   Two years ago, Mills starred at the National Theater opposite
Rosemary Harris in Brian Clark's ``The Petition,'' which later
moved to London's commercial West End.
   Last April, he opened on Broadway in an all-star revival of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' playing Doolittle, the dustman.
   But he said his grandchildren have their own favorite Mills role
_ his part with Madonna in last year's flop movie, ``Who's That
Girl?''
   ``(To them), that was the greatest thing I could possibly have
done,'' Mills said.

<HEAD>Bridge Over River Thames Closed After Tugboat Rams It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tugboat towing two barges rammed the center of a
bridge over the River Thames, forcing authorities to close it to
traffic, police reported.
   The Battersea Road bridge that was struck late Thursday is a main
thoroughfare and its closure threatens traffic disruption in the
already badly congested capital during the morning rush hour.
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said the bridge would be inspected
today during low tide to assess the damage and decide whether it
could reopen.
   ``The tug Touchstone was negotiating the river with two barges
when it struck the northeast corner of the center arch,'' said the
spokeswoman, who in accordance with British practice declined to be
named.
   ``Traffic diversions will be in place but it is going to cause
some congestion,'' she added.
   She said it was not immediately clear how much damage was caused
but said no one was hurt.

'LAWRENCE' STARS RECALL EPIC ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a quarter century has elapsed since they acted in "Lawrence of 
Arabia," and their involvement in the epic saga ranged from nearly two years to 
a mere three days. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer retain 
vivid personal memories of that experience, even as they share a collective 
admiration that nears reverence for the film's director, Sir David Lean. 
</P>
<P>
Peter O'Toole was cast as T. E. Lawrence when he was 28 years old. He did not 
complete the role until he was 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Truly, there were times late in filming in Spain when I thought the production 
would never end," O'Toole said during a phone conversation from London. 
</P>
<P>
But in the beginning, on the Jordanian desert, O'Toole was a young actor being 
handed the opportunity of a lifetime -- and eager to absorb a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
"There was the thrill of being on this remote desert where God was born," he 
said. "The Hebrew God, Islamic God and Christian God were all born in this 
same, superbly desolate place. Being there, one could understand why. The 
desert was furious, savage, beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It was also exhausting, the locale for the film's most taxing scenes. O'Toole 
singled out the sequence in which Lawrence struggles to save a Bedouin youth 
from quicksand as his single most draining experience. 
</P>
<P>
How long did the sequence take? 
</P>
<P>
"A long time," he answered, and even as he spoke, his voice wearied. "A long, 
long, long time. We filmed it in real desert sandstorms when possible, and we 
created sandstorms with aircraft propellers when necessary. If I hadn't been 
holding that boy, he would have sunk." 
</P>
<P>
Through the seemingly endless months of filming, he was buoyed by his bond with 
Lean, though often there were times when O'Toole was unsure of what was going 
on behind his taciturn director's incandescent eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes would begin to talk to David and feel as if I were talking to a 
statue," O'Toole said. "Other days, he would walk up to me and say, 'Pete, do 
you really think . . .,' and then he would walk away. And I never would learn 
what was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived completely in his own world, inside his head. Eventually we developed 
a system where, if he was staring off into nowhere, I would ask, 'Vacant or 
pensive?' He would always reply, 'Vacant.' 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't need to talk very much. We communicated by a kind of semaphore: 
higher, lower, louder, softer." 
</P>
<P>
For O'Toole, who at the time had appeared in only three movies, "Lawrence" 
provided a thorough course in film making. "I learned from David every day," he 
said. "Our relationship is still very much master-pupil." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lean, the fledgling screen actor was exposed to a cast of 
international stars. "Making the film was like a bull fight," O'Toole said. "I 
felt like a toreador. I was in the ring, and every few minutes they opened the 
trap and out popped another bull: Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Alec Guinness, 
Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, Anthony Quayle." 
</P>
<P>
From Jordan to Seville and Almeria in Spain ("That's where I felt the film 
would never end"), then to the deserts of Morocco. "It was invigorating to 
return to the desert," O'Toole said, as if that's where he felt closest to 
Lawrence, a character he meticulously researched -- and still does. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many, many T. E. Lawrences," he said, "but they can be grouped under 
two categories: the real man and the legend. The real man I think I know as 
well as anybody. I like to think that David's film provided the legend with its 
zenith." 
</P>
<P>
And his reaction to the film's current restoration? 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time! There were nearly 30 missing minutes. And they were strange 
choices to nip. Not complete scenes, but rather as if a rodent had been 
nibbling at it." 
</P>
<P>
As he looped this new print, he couldn't help but recall the first day of 
desert filming more than 28 years ago when David Lean told his his young 
charge, "This is going to be a great adventure." 
</P>
<P>
"And that's exactly what it was," O'Toole said. "It's a journey I would travel 
again, every mile of the way, willingly." 
</P>
<P>
Like O'Toole, Omar Sharif also emerged from the picture an international star. 
"With a part like Ali in a film like 'Lawrence,' any idiot would have become a 
film star," he said during a phone conversation from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with Lean is always an event," Sharif said, "because he takes such 
enormous care for every single shot. Therefore, everyone feels that he or she 
is contributing to something special, and indeed, you are." 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, Sharif described the first scene he filmed, in which his 
character, a sheik, comes riding out of the desert and confronts Lawrence at 
the well. 
</P>
<P>
"It took one month to film that brief sequence," Sharif said. "Not all the 
month was spent in filming, of course. There was much waiting for the right 
conditions. David had clear ideas about the look he wanted for the desert. He 
would place black rocks in the distance. He would even color the sand to 
attract the viewer's eye. Then, after they'd driven out and done all that, 300 
men had to sweep away the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"I still know that entire scene by heart. It was a pleasure to act those words 
by Robert Bolt. They're all short one-syllable words, but they say everything. 
This is exactly what film writing should be." 
</P>
<P>
Sharif worked on "Lawrence" for 20 months. (Three years later, again under 
Lean's direction, he spent only 12 months filming his title-role performance in 
"Doctor Zhivago.") 
</P>
<P>
"All the work in the desert was exhausting," he said. "Camels don't stay on 
their marks. They have larger strides than horses. If a camel leaves its mark 
by even one step, you've moved three feet out of the frame." 
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who rates "Lawrence of Arabia" as "David Lean's best film," said he 
will "be thrilled" to see the newly restored director's cut. "But I'll also 
look at that young actor on the screen with 15 missing pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Quinn was already an international star, a two-time Academy Award 
winner, when he traveled to Jordan to portray a tribal sheik. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with David Lean immediately," Quinn said as he sat in a Los 
Angeles hotel suite. "David is one of the greatest directors alive. He lives in 
the atmosphere of the picture. He never leaves that picture for one second. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a man of very long pauses, and when he says something, it's after long 
consideration. It's sifted through his genius, and then the flower blooms. And 
he makes that flower bloom in you. Through his own tremendous humanity, he 
brings out all the actor's positive qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Lean spent all morning staging a scene "with thousands of camels and horses and 
riders" in which Lawrence asks Auda if they can attack the Turkish-held city of 
Aqaba the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at noon, the shot was set up. 
</P>
<P>
"So we rehearsed," Quinn recalled, "and David said, 'Let's go for a take.' I 
started to walk back into the scene when David, who is a very sensitive man, 
called me aside and asked if something was the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, David, let's do the scene.' It had taken four hours to set the thing 
up! 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'No, I want to know what's the matter.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I told him that because I know there's going to be a huge battle in which 
I'll lose a lot of men, perhaps I should go over, sit on a rock and think about 
my answer. I should say, 'Yes, we attack tomorrow,' but only after due 
consideration for my men. 
</P>
<P>
"David thought a moment, took a long drag from his cigarette -- which he smokes 
in the most amazing way, upside down -- and then said, 'Start moving the 
horses, we're going to change the camera angle.' 
</P>
<P>
"It took all afternoon. I was so embarrassed. And by the time it was ready, at 
4:30, we had to do the scene in one take or lose the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"So we did it and wrapped for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"As David was getting into his car, I went up to him and said, 'David, I 
apologize.' 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'For what, Tony?' 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible to make you change the horses and the extras. I promise I'll 
never do it again.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he says, 'Don't you ever stop. You can suggest anything you want. I'm not 
that insecure.' " 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to O'Toole, Sharif and Quinn, Jose Ferrer worked on "Lawrence of 
Arabia" for only three days and appears on screen for just five minutes. But to 
the Academy Award-winning star, whose motion picture roles span more than four 
decades, they're the most important five minutes of his film career. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrer recalled his brief but critical vignette during a phone conversation 
from Minneapolis, where he was filming "Old Explorers" with James Whitmore. 
Ferrer played the Turkish bey, whose humiliation and torture of Lawrence was a 
turning point in the adventurer's life, 
</P>
<P>
In late 1961 and early '62, Ferrer said, while the others were in Jordan, he 
was in India filming "Nine Hours to Rama." 
</P>
<P>
"We finished the picture in London," he continued. "One day I bumped into Sam 
Spiegel in Berkeley Square. He saw me and said, 'You're just the guy I'm 
looking for. I still need to cast one role in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Send me the script.' 
</P>
<P>
"So this massive script arrived, hundreds of pages long, and I couldn't find 
the part. It turned out to be maybe three pages and two lines. I said to my 
agent, 'Why is Spiegel trying to humiliate me? Why does he insult me?' I was 
very hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"But they showed me 30 minutes of already-assembled footage. I could see it was 
something quite special, though I didn't realize how special until I arrived in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very little conversation on the set, but we didn't need to talk. 
David Lean, Peter O'Toole and I were instantly so in tune with each other, it 
was almost like being part of a string trio. O'Toole and Lean were Champagne 
and caviar. 
</P>
<P>
"In 40 years of screen acting, I've made maybe 40 movies. But if I had to be 
judged as a film actor by only one performance, I would want to be judged by 
the five minutes in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' I deem those five minutes to be my 
best work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawrence of Arabia" opens here Wednesday. A premiere to benefit the American 
Film Institute is scheduled for Sunday.

RIDING 'TRAIN OF MANY SOULS' THROUGH MALAYSIA

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're rolling north toward Bangkok, and the moon has been stealing through the 
rice paddies for hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey you, American," whispers my Thai seatmate, Song Mai. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes don't rivet like a Westerner's. They open and take me in as if I were 
a faintly remembered landscape. She passes a pint of Mae Khong whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't these trains always make you feel like a spy?" 
</P>
<P>
That's it! After logging 1,000 miles over almost every bit of track -- from 
Singapore's wharves to the beaches of Malaysia and Thailand's Golden Triangle 
-- I have met a fellow traveler who can find words for the feeling you get on 
Southeast Asia's trains. 
</P>
<P>
"See what I mean?" She points out the window with the whiskey bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network of Canals 
</P>
<P>
The train has begun to brake. We shuffle along a network of canals called 
klongs. A warren of stilt houses covers the bank. Charcoal braziers burn in the 
doorways. Figures paddle narrow boats through the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
An old man, looking like a starved Buddha, stands up to his knees and naked in 
the moonshine on the klong, soaping his thighs in slow strokes. A girl leaps 
from porch to porch above the water, pursued by a band of boys waving a snake. 
For a second we can hear them laughing. 
</P>
<P>
That about sums things up. A typical interlude along what some call "the 
railway of many souls." 
</P>
<P>
The name comes from the popular notion that the Malay and Thai rail systems 
might have cost more lives to build than Cheops' Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Since the British stretched the first tracks north of Singapore in 1903, about 
150,000 Malay, Chinese and Tamil coolies have lost their lives pushing the 
railway through equatorial jungle and swamp. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen thousand British, Dutch and Australian POWs died extending the "death 
railway" to Burma during the Japanese occupation in World War II. Cemeteries at 
the bridge over the River Kwai serve as unforgettable reminders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glimpses of Asia 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of this rail system is the Singapore-to-Bangkok line. At $100 for 
a second-class sleeper, the International Express is an inexpensive way to look 
beyond the "instant Asia" of package-tour fame. 
</P>
<P>
One can make the 642-mile trip in three days and two nights, but anyone wanting 
more than glimpses into Asia will break the trip into shorter legs. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is a good place to begin. Aboard the northbound train you enter 
deeper into the grass-roots culture of the Malay Peninsula. On the morning 
express to Kuala Lampur you might have a seatmate like Haji, who came aboard in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
With an offer of "magical" beans, Haji made it clear to me that this would not 
be a trip where I could settle back in the air-conditioned coach and watch a 
movie or video. 
</P>
<P>
While the train slurred over streams and through the rolling hills of rubber 
and palm oil plantations, my new acquaintance announced: "I, Haji the Malay, 
son of the soil, have retired. Please congratulate me!" 
</P>
<P>
This was his way of introduction and he spoke to our entire end of the railway 
car. Looking a bit like Red Foxx, Haji spoke in clipped bursts and made people 
laugh with ironic twitches of his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five years I spent my life selling. You name it, I have sold it. But 
enough; I quit. Like an honest Muslim I have made a good life for three wives 
and 14 children. Now . . . they will take care of me!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Like Singapore 
</P>
<P>
Haji said he was bound for the kampong (village) of his birth to spend the rest 
of his life talking with old friends and to "watch the monkeys play in the 
trees." A fetching idea. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the signs in Bahasa Malaysia, the domes of mosques and women 
swaddled like nuns in the Muslim buju kurongs, Kuala Lampur -- the capital of 
predominantly Islamic Malaysia -- looked like a smaller version of Singapore, 
so I continued north in search of Haji's more earthy Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
During the space of three days Penang Island bared Malaysia's ethnic diversity. 
With a population of 50% Malay, 35% Chinese and 10% Indian, this 25-year-old 
nation has suffered its share of racial struggles, but at Penang you feel none 
of the tension you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, Penang's urban center, is just a ferry ride across the harbor from 
the train station in Butterworth. Much of this city of 400,000 looks as it did 
as a British colony 50 or 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dense neighborhoods of Indians and Chinese fill the heart of the city. Malay 
fishing kampongs dot the coast. Night markets, cafes, food stalls and bicycle 
rickshaws rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hindu Procession 
</P>
<P>
On a single night I found myself absorbed by Chinese paper tigers and the sway 
of a Hindu procession -- drums, flutes, goddesses and all. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel rooms cost between $4 and $140, but almost all look out on this Asian 
mardi gras. Music in five languages pulses from the speakers of street vendors 
selling pirated cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds linger over coffee, fresh fruit juices, Dutch beer and satay chicken on 
skewers. Making friends is as easy as the common practice of sharing a table 
along the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Thai National Railway handles the Butterworth-Bangkok leg of the trip, and 
the service and equipment stand in contrast to the Malaysian trains. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Malays had large, modern cars the Thais offer 32-passenger fan-cooled 
sleepers. Each car has its own bank of washbasins, a shower and patrols of 
attendants standing ready to provide blankets, make beds, vend drinks and 
deliver multicourse, spicy meals to your seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought by Backpackers 
</P>
<P>
You might break the 24-hour trip to Bangok by stopping in Surat Thani and 
divert by bus and ferry to one of Thailand's southern resorts. Head east and 
you find Koh Samui, a primitive retreat favored by backpackers looking for 
little more than a grass A-frame on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
On the west coast of this thin peninsula, Phuket offers dramatic scenery and 
first-class services reminiscent of Jamaica or Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north the thoroughly Thai resorts of Cha-Am and Hua Hin could be 
alternative stops. Westerners will recognize parts of Hua Hin, particularly the 
Railway Hotel (now upgraded to a five-star resort), as a stand-in for Phnom 
Penh in the 1984 film, "The Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
In real life the town sways to the beat of a large fishing fleet and lively 
night market. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the southern portion of the rail line, which burrowed through the rubber 
and palm forests, the north leg races through the coastal plains of rice 
paddies bound by hedges of limestone mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath these peaks, peasants in black pajamas and straw hats pick rice, tend 
to their oxcarts and herd water buffalo as if it were a thousand years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Here, of course, Song Mai's voice offered a lilting commentary on everything we 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at my world, American," she said. "Very subtle Oriental loops of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
River Taxi Tour 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok I headed for the nearest stop on the Chao Phraya River Express. For 
40 cents I bought an hour's escape on a river taxi and watched the sun set over 
the golden roofs of the temples and palaces that line the river. 
</P>
<P>
As the boat hummed from wharf to wharf a violet haze spread over the city. A 
mist of incense, coconuts, sweat, chili peppers and fish spilled from the stilt 
houses on the klongs that branched inland. The mist seeped from the floating 
city of sampans, the waterfront restaurants and the barbecue pit of the 
Oriental Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Bangkok all yours," said a schoolgirl pressed next to me on the fantail of the 
boat. She swept her open hand around the riverscape and smiled. An offer. 
</P>
<P>
"But where do I begin?" I asked, thinking of the dozens of stops the Express 
made and the countless ways a soul might enter into this city. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter," said the girl. "You always come back to the water." 
</P>
<P>
And the railway that twines among the banks, I added in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Song Mai might have liked the image. Endless Oriental loops of life here.

<HEAD>Restored `Lawrence Of Arabia' Makes Omar Sharif Nostalgic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Omar Sharif felt a bit old when he
joined fellow ``Lawrence of Arabia'' star Anthony Quinn and director
Sir David Lean for the local premiere of the restored 1962 Oscar
winner.
   Sharif watched himself ride across desert sands in his role as
Sherif Ali in the restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of
the movie, which won seven Academy Awards.
   ``It's like a veterans' reunion _ everyone's limping along and
has pot bellies,'' Sharif said after the screening Sunday night.
   ``I feel very nostalgic because I haven't seen it for 27 years,''
he said. ``It's like re-seeing your youth.''
   The ``Lawrence'' premiere followed similar galas a week ago in
New York and Washington. The screenings and banquets benefited The
American Film Institute and its campaign to restore and preserve
classic films.
   Lean, 80, urged Hollywood to take risks to make quality films.
   ``Spend some money on risky subjects,'' Lean said. ``It's no good
being safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.''
   Lean called the late Sam Spiegel, who produced ``Lawrence,''
``one of the last of the great gamblers that have disappeared,'' but
also criticized him for chopping the film.
   Lean's original version was cut by nearly 30 minutes shortly
after the film's release. Lean contends Spiegel made the first cuts
behind his back, but others have questioned Lean's version. An
additional 15 minutes was removed when ``Lawrence'' was reissued in
1971.
   Peter O'Toole, who portrayed T.E. Lawrence, didn't attend the Los
Angeles premiere. But the screening drew composer Maurice Jarre,
film editor Anne Coates and cinematographer Fred A. Young. All
three, along with Lean, won Oscars for the film, which won as best
picture of 1962.

David Lean, the recipient of this year's American Film Institute Lifetime 
Achievement Award, is the world's leading exemplar of the epic film maker. At 
82, he's preparing to direct an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's great, mad novel 
"Nostromo," and already the project is being talked about not only as Lean's 
Last Stand but, also, as the last great outpost of the epic adventure film. The 
lionization of Lean is both a tribute to the grandeur of his best work, like 
"Lawrence of Arabia," and a recognition that such grandeur has mostly vanished 
from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, a Lean-like movie recently opened, Bob Rafelson's "Mountains of 
the Moon," about Sir Richard Burton and the quest for the source of the Nile. 
It's an epic, all right, but a dull one. Still, those of us who love 
grand-scale spectacle may be willing to indulge the film for old time's sake. 
The form inspires, even if the movie doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Epic adventure movies have never been in large supply but, until the last 
several decades, they were a dependably tried-and-true staple. Films like "King 
Solomon's Mines," both the 1937 and 1950 versions, or the 1939 "Stanley and 
Livingstone" -- to name a few of my faves -- delivered uncomplicated 
storylines, stalwart heroes and lots of fervid junglescapes. As 
racial-historical tracts, they never rose much above the Call-Me-Bwana level, 
but that didn't seem to matter much. Except as fantasies, nobody took these 
films seriously anyway. They were the product of eras which could easily 
accommodate their Victorianized boys'-book reactionaryism. Heroism was defined 
as action, and action was most often expressed as the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was a while ago. In cultural terms, the comparatively "politically 
aware" eras that followed exposed the Great White Hunter trappings of these 
films and made their continuation in the same form untenable. The ways in which 
the white hunters were championed and the natives devalued was perceived as a 
noxious simplification -- an evasion of the true nature of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for the demise of the epic adventure film. For one, 
costs have become prohibitive, at least in theory. ("Mountains of the Moon" was 
financed for a relatively measly $18 million; Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" 
cost around $23 million.) Studios are still quite capable of coughing up kingly 
fortunes to finance their movies, but they tend to put their bucks into star 
salaries and hardware. Making a movie involving oodles of extras and far-off 
locations, with period sets and costumes, is not the sort of expedition that 
Hollywood's Great White Studio Heads are particularly willing to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Movies of exploration are also regarded as antiquated in the modern era. What 
is there left to discover? Territorial exploration has moved beyond earthly 
borders. Outer space is the new uncharted jungle -- just substitute hostile 
aliens (usually "dark") for hostile natives. In such a play-act universe, 
heroes and villains can act out the same old reactionary scenarios without 
rankling any real-world political sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
The never-never-land settings also make it possible to portray, often 
tongue-in-cheek, the kind of straight-arrow, unambiguous heroes who can no 
longer be comfortably depicted in American movies in the post-Vietnam phase. 
Vietnam altered the portrayal of heroism in American movies by calling into 
question the country's motivations for foreign expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the American as the square-jawed avenger of injustice was turned 
on its head; in counterculture terms, what once was regarded as heroism was 
converted into a species of villainy. The use of force carried tragic 
consequences. The new hero who emerged from this smoking debris turned out to 
be the man who valued his ability to run away from danger. He wasn't John 
Wayne. He was Woody Allen and Richard Pryor. This has changed somewhat. 
Currently, the new product line of American movie hero is the one who voyages 
inward. Victories are not territorial but emotional, and small-scale -- they're 
about learning how to read, how to love again. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few decades, the adventure epic, when it hasn't transferred to 
outer space, has been almost exclusively spoofy. From the "Indiana Jones" cycle 
on down to "Romancing the Stone" and "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle," these epics 
buy off their antique ooga-booga ideologies by turning the whole expeditionary 
enterprise into a joke. They bring to the fore the absurdities that were always 
lurking just below the stalwart surface of the genre. It's understandable that 
a director like Steven Spielberg, who by his own admission was in strong 
measure formed as a film maker watching such movies as "Lawrence of Arabia," 
would feel drawn to the epic form; or that, given his essentially 
kicky-adolescent world view, he would instinctively lampoon the form as a way 
of making it his own. But even the best of these adventure spoofs are somewhat 
disappointing -- weightless. There isn't much that's awesome in the movies 
anymore, and so it's disconcerting to see awe-inspiring feats in majestic 
landscapes reduced to rinky-dink high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
When epic adventures aren't being spoofy, they are often being revisionist. In 
movies like "Greystoke" and "The Mission," the form is used as an ideological 
chalkboard. The pure pleasures of epic panorama are subverted to the "message," 
which is often bulky and overweening: the Nature of Man, the Nature of 
Imperialism, and so on. There's nothing illicit about using a king-size canvas 
to push a personal agenda -- D.W. Griffith did it -- but too many of the 
agendas are as bloated as their movie's budgets. Movies are an inadequate 
medium for conveying complex sociopolitical arguments; they're much better at 
sensation and immediacy, and the epic form only tends to emphasize the 
inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the epic-adventure film is, of course, all-of-a-piece with the 
demise of the epic film in general. The epic survives in its purest form not on 
the big screen but on the small, as miniseries. Films with subjects of epic 
historical scope like, say, "Roots" or "The Thorn Birds" or "Lonesome Dove," 
are now almost strictly the province of television. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that the movie business, which reacted to the threat of television 
in the '50s by scaling things big and high and wide, should now have turned 
tail and relinquished the epic to the airwaves. An entire generation of young 
viewers has grown up with a distorted idea of the epic film, because the epics 
they watch are all housed in a small box, where most of the qualities that made 
them worth watching are eliminated. Many of the movie theaters in the 
multiplexes are small boxes too. Is it any wonder film makers are so reluctant 
to embark on epic projects? 
</P>
<P>
It may only be a matter of time before television also disposes of the epic 
form. The disappointing ratings for a humongous series like "War and 
Remembrance" was taken as an object lesson by the networks; it's doubtful that, 
in the current climate, even a "Lonesome Dove" could be made again. The 
sound-bite ethos of television has taken its toll on the national attention 
span and cramped the medium's ability to convey the significance of monumental 
events. Television is being employed without a sense of historical moment; you 
would never know from watching most news shows that we are in the middle of one 
of greatest global political shifts in the 20th Century. The epic movie is 
predicated on a sense of narrative history, and that sense is increasingly 
absent from mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that good epics, exploration-adventure or otherwise, still 
can't, or shouldn't be made. It's a mistake to assume that these movies have to 
cost zillions, or that they should only respond to the four-square conservatism 
of the times by mythologizing four-square conservative heroes. Epics can 
embrace diverse mythologies -- it all depends who's doing the mythologizing. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a mistake to discount old-fashioned "King Solomon's Mines"-type 
squareness. Square doesn't necessarily have to be reactionary; it can be 
beautiful too. The impulse to create comprehensible heroes who live on in some 
protected precinct of our childhoods is not to be belittled. Probably the best 
epic adventure movie of the past 15 years, John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be 
King," was frankly and unapologetically an outsider's vision, with no attempt 
to "modernize" its view of the natives. On the other side, "Lawrence of Arabia" 
demonstrated that the epic adventure could accommodate a hero who was, at 
bottom, incomprehensible. Lean's stately craftsmanship set off T.E. Lawrence's 
depth-charged psychological ambiguities, and that's what made the film seem so 
traditional and yet so modern. 
</P>
<P>
The epic form is alive as long as there are writers and directors with epic 
imaginations, and actors who can embody their visions. And there are, there 
are. We're surrounded by directors (Roger Spottiswoode, Geoff Murphy, and Fred 
Schepisi, for starters) and actors (Nick Nolte, Judy Davis, Denzel Washington, 
Aidan Quinn immediately come to mind) who carry around even in their 
small-scale work an epic purchase on history. They're poised for heroic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Epic movies aren't some lumbering offshoot of the medium. Their sheer bigness 
is basic to the medium, as basic as the quality of stardom. If you were born 
before the '60s, chances are that the movies that first opened your eyes were 
the swashbuckling spectacles. They may not always have been very good, but they 
suggested reaches of adventure and heroism and history that made moviegoing the 
most exciting of romances. It's high time to renew the romance. 
</P>
<P>
I can't wait for "Nostromo."

   Will you rush to turn on TV when it's time for "Golden Girders"? 
Or will you decide engineers are incurably unromantic -- dull, even? 

   On the side of the engineers is the head of a congressional task force who believes that all it takes to turn them into the hottest TV attraction since lawyers is a star-studded, prime-time television show. 

   "I don't see why we can't get somebody to do an 'L.A. 
Engineers,'" says Sue Kemnitzer, director of a task force charged with attracting more women and minorities to engineering and science. 
"These people do important, dramatic things, and still have time left for romance." 

   Alarmed by the declining number of U.S. students majoring in engineering, Ms. Kemnitzer believes an engineering melodrama could do wonders for undergraduate interest in the field, much as "L.A. 
Law" revived interest in law school. 
"What we're trying to do is get 'Roseanne' to go to engineering school," she says. 

   In July, Ms. Kemnitzer argued her case in Los Angeles before several people active in film and TV production. 
But Hollywood hasn't exactly erupted with proposals. 

   "I think it's a whimsical idea . . . not very realistic," says Robert Hoffman, an independent producer who met with Ms. Kemnitzer. 
And scriptwriters say the best she can hope for are jazzier supporting roles for high-tech types. 
"It would be a big improvement if TV didn't always portray engineers and scientists as people in white coats doing strange things in secret," says Jeff Stetson, a Los Angeles writer. 

   Others, however, are more optimistic about prospects for a full-blown series on engineers. 
"It's really a question of packaging," says Alan Bloom, who heads the film and TV production program at California State University at Los Angeles. 
"If you put the show together right, it could really sell." 

   Mr. Bloom believes a multinational engineering company could provide the dramatic backdrop for an ensemble cast, much in the way a Los Angeles law firm provides the stage for lawyers specializing in criminal, divorce and corporate law. 
"You could have one character troubleshooting the cause of a bridge collapse, another one exterminating a computer virus, a third working on a space project," he explains.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 11 p.m. White-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to 
beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a 
molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the late shift. It is the only shift at "EPLF Pharmaceuticals," a 
lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest 
independent electricity supply. 
</P>
<P>
Outside in a remote valley in Eritrea in northern Ethiopia, crickets and frogs 
join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing African hares over the 
boulders. Civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, technicians of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front produce no less 
than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into 
brown bottles marked "EPLF Drug Production and Research" over a logo of a cobra 
wrapped round a pharmacist's pestle. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting 
the EPLF's 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from Ethiopia. They 
produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded 
shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and 
even sanitary towels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety of Darkness 
</P>
<P>
Like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they 
are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the 
threat of bombardment from Ethiopian MIG warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
All are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as 
their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key EPLF doctrine of 
self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from 
external support. 
</P>
<P>
Basic chemicals are imported from Europe to make a range of the most frequently 
used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The EPLF 
factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 EPLF-approved drugs 
covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements, 
anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than $750,000 a 
year -- $310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Shipping Containers 
</P>
<P>
Plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers 
and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an Eritrean 
pharmacist trained in Ethiopia and the United States, is hidden conveniently 
close to the EPLF's main hospital at Arota in northern Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small 
units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow 
valley. It links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic 
stations concealed near the battle fronts. 
</P>
<P>
About 99% of EPLF, civilian and Ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated 
for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes 
and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial 
plant for both civilian and military needs. That includes giant generating 
units to supply basic power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italian Moulding Machine 
</P>
<P>
Footwear was a headache until Eritreans working abroad donated an Italian PVC 
injection molding machine eight years ago. It now cranks out 100 hot pairs of 
black plastic sandals an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of 
the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from 
fighters in the field. Black was not a color chosen on considerations of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"White wouldn't do for camouflage reasons," said a sandal worker. "Black is the 
most convenient in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
Italian colonists who founded an Eritrean state in the late 19th Century left 
little transport infrastructure. Most major Eritrean towns are connected by 
poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to Eritrean supply convoys 
because of possible land mines and the threat from Ethiopian warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required 
alternative networks. In physical terms, this was probably the greatest 
challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the Eritrean liberation 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile, Rocky Landscapes 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been 
driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. Most are hidden in dry, winding river 
beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin 
turns that would dizzy a Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks," said a 
veteran fighter. "These days, it's a bit different." 
</P>

The rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder, 
supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war. 
Like the stiff-lipped Britons of the "Bridge over the River Kwai" movie, they 
appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the Eritrean revolt.

Garages dot the supply routes. They have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing 
tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement 
pistons and rings with critical tolerances.

Some specialize like Western car dealers in particular models such as Toyota 
Landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive Moskovitches or monolithic Soviet 
trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick.

Chipped Coke Bottles

The parsimonious efficiency of the EPLF backup operation, in which precious 
little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. Scraps of waste bread piled on 
sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form 
the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped 
Coke bottles.

In the ruined central Eritrean town of Nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost 
daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell 
case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm 
bell.

Like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded 
bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. Rocket casings become 
charcoal grills and cooking knives. Door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing 
and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings, 
roof insulation and false ceilings. USAID sacks are particularly popular. They 
are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
At the swarming Ethiopian POW camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away 
hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick 
as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green, 
they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on EPLF 
agricultural research stations. 
</P>
<P>
The golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. The Eritreans 
have no alternative to self-reliance.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Diggers locate secrets of Xerxes' lost canal: Tales from the
earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<TEXT>
XERXES was the king of ancient Persia who took the long road to Greece in
480 BC to punish the Greeks for supporting rebels and, when he got there,
lost the battles of Salamis and Plataea. Rather more recently, there have
been full houses for a superlative production of Handel's opera Xerxes at
the London Coliseum.
Played poignantly as an arrogant and capricious despot, we find him
infatuated with a tree as the curtain goes up. Then he has the mad idea of
linking Asia and Europe by a bridge over the Hellespont (Dardanelles), but a
storm puts paid to this icon of folie de grandeur. Nor does he get the girl
he fancies. It is an old story of futile pride. But a state-of-the-art
archaeological project in Greece this past autumn shows it is not just a
story. Xerxes really was a man who did things on the grand scale. Sub-soil
radar has found the great canal he dug across Mt Athos to bring his navy
down safely to southern Greece.
Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo-Greek team of
scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground
from a sledge. It emits radio waves, like conventional radar, and measures
those that bounce back when they hit an interruption - a hard task, as all
there is to detect underground is the change between the fill and the sides
of Xerxes's canal.
The lack of buried structures stretched the new technique to its limits. But
it found the line in 3-D beneath 7-8 metres of hill slide, and has plotted
it for 2,200 metres without the expense of digging. Its length is exactly
what the Greek historian Herodotus gives: 12 stades (or furlongs).
Handel's picture follows Herodotus, who paints Xerxes as a wayward tyrant
with whom brave little Greece battled (and beat) despite overwhelming odds.
But even Greeks thought his monuments in Persia staggering. If you go to
Iran, do not miss the palaces of Xerxes and his father, Darius, at
Persepolis. Huge columned halls stand on a great podium. The sculptures show
28 subject nations from the Ionians (the Greeks on the Aegean coast of
Turkey) in the West to the Indians in the East carrying tribute in
procession to the king.
When Darius died in 486 BC, Xerxes inherited Persepolis - and problems in
the empire. The Ionians had revolted in 499 and Athens supported them.
Darius went to punish them but lost the battle of Marathon in 490. He had to
be avenged.
Preparations for Xerxes Greek campaign of 480 were stupendous. The army was
so vast that it could drink a river dry, Herodotus says, and Xerxes numbered
it by corralling 10,000 men into a tight pen, releasing them, and then
marching the rest into the pen in turn. That gave a total of 1.7m troops, an
exaggeration probably by nine or 10 times. Even so, it was a huge number.
The Hellespont is a mile wide and flows fast as the Black Sea joins the
Aegean. Although nothing survives, and Byron did not bump into any bits when
he swam across, the bridge was a superb idea. But Xerxes could not control
the weather (Handel gives full vent to the storm) and the first bridge
broke. He was so angry that he ordered his men to give the Hellespont 300
strokes of the lash, saying: 'O bitter water, our master lays this
punishment on you as you have wronged him though he has never done you
wrong.' The engineers were executed. The new ones tied two lines of ships
together, stretched cables between them, and laid a road on top. Xerxes sat
on a marble throne to watch the army cross. It took two days.
The Athos peninsula was the next obstacle. Earlier, the Persians had lost
ships sailing round it. So, Xerxes ordered the canal through its narrow
isthmus and put men to dig it under the lash, in the style of the river Kwai
railway. The Greeks thought the scheme odd, as they were used to
island-hopping across the Aegean. But the Persians liked to keep their land
and sea armies in touch in alien territories, for security and flexibility.
Although Herodotus described this marvel of ancient engineering in detail,
there was no archaeological exploration until Isserlin came. 'Up to now, the
search has been better than my wildest dreams,' he says, certain that there
is a big ditch underneath and not a haulage-way for ships as at ancient
Corinth. Eventually, he hopes to dig trenches to see how it was constructed,
but with the accumulated debris and soft ground there is a risk the sides
may cave in. He might, however, be able to solve his final problem: who were
the surveyors? Greeks coerced to work for the king? If he finds that the
canal's dimensions fit Greek measuring systems, the likely answer is 'yes'.
After Athos, Xerxes marched on down Greece, forced his way at Thermpoylae
(where 300 brave Spartans resisted to the last man) and destroyed the
temples on the Athens Acropolis and in the country around, while the Greeks
prepared to hold the isthmus of Corinth. But he lost his navy at Salamis,
and the army lost at Plataea the following year. Greece triumphed. In 464,
Xerxes was murdered in a palace intrigue.
If Herodotus came back today, he would be delighted that his account of the
canal stands up so well to modern science - and that Handel saw Xerxes the
same way he did.

   A newly restored version of the epic film
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' scheduled to open here later this week,
previewed Saturday before a star-studded audience that included the
movie's leading actors, Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole, and its
director, David Lean.
   The movie, which originally opened in 1962, tells the story of
Lawrence's strategy in guiding the 1917-1918 Arab revolt against the
Ottoman Empire. O'Toole plays Lawrence and Sharif plays his friend
Ali.
   The restored version lengthens the film by about 20 minutes to
about four hours, adding transitional passages, scenes in which the
British military plots its strategy, and scenes that add to the
viewer's understanding of Lawrence's personality.
   Saturday's screening, a benefit for the American Film Institute,
also was attended by stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Donald
Sutherland and director Steven Spielberg.
