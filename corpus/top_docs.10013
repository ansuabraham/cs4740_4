EXPERTS MAP STRATEGY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST 




By PAUL RAEBURN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




NEW YORK 




The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could 
finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries 
and leading scientists from around the world. 


"That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in 
recent years," said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian 
Institution and an Amazon specialist. 


"It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about 
conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news," Lovejoy 
said in a recent interview. 


Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest, lies in 
Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight surrounding countries. 


Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in mid-January in 
Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people in the heart of the 
Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's once-thriving rubber trade. 


The workshop, which brought together all the governments and scientists with 
interests in the rain forest, culminated with a plan to regulate development in 
up to 80% of the Amazon region. 


It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon had met to 
pool their knowledge and agree on conservation priorities, the meeting's 
participants said. 


The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has broad 
government support and is likely to serve as a guide for national conservation 
programs, participants said. 


Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called multiple-use 
development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the 
commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. 


Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by developers and 
peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle ranching or farming, has been 
ambivalent about the need to conserve the Amazon. 


Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the setting of 
priorities was "all done with the blessing of Brazil," Lovejoy said. 


Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands of plant and 
animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30% of the world's plant and animal 
species. 


One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken from the deep 
shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants representing 50 species. 


Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor are home to 
countless birds and insects that live their lives without ever setting foot on 
the ground. One group of orchid species grows only near the top of the canopy; 
an entirely different collection of orchids grows at the bottom. 


At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small groups to assess 
conservation priorities. 


Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the stinging ant that 
defends acacia trees against predators. Mammalogists took inventory of the 
Amazon's screeching monkeys. Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the 
fish that eats fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it 
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same. 


Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the Amazon. When they 
were done, the areas determined to be worth saving covered 70% to 80% of the 
Amazon. 


"The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no way of getting 
around that," said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International 
and an authority on endangered monkeys. 


Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic goals for the 
establishment of national parks and reserves, along with multiple-use areas 
where some development could occur. 


It is not realistic to build a fence around 70% to 80% of the Amazon, he said. 
Only the most critical areas should be placed off limits to development. 


"Ten (percent) to 20% of the entire Amazon should be in protected parks or 
preserves, ideally," he said. At present, 2% of the Amazon is protected. 


Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan. 


"The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards the work that has 
got to be done," said Stanley Malone, director of the Suriname Forest Service. 


Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978 to develop a 
unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone said. What the officials 
lacked, however, was a guide to which areas most need protection. 


That determination has now been made, based on the number of different species 
a given area contains, and on how many of those species are unique to the area. 


"Now we'll have to see what develops from this," Mittermeier said. A new 
Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, was inaugurated this month, and 
with him comes a new Brazilian environmental policy. 


Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is uncertain. "As 
always, everything depends on key individuals," Mittermeier said. 


"I'm basically always optimistic," he said. "I feel sure that we can develop 
appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of work."

OUTTAKES: CHICO, THE MAN 




By John M. Wilson 




While Hollywood heavyweights battle for the right to film the story of Chico 
Mendes, martyred defender of Brazil's disappearing rain forests, a small 
company in Berkeley will probably get to the big screen early next year with a 
documentary on the subject. 


The nonprofit Amazonia Film Project is now in post-production on "Amazonia: 
Voices From the Rain Forest," which associate producer Kevin Pina calls the 
"first feature-length documentary ever produced on the Amazon rain forests." 
Included is an interview with Mendes that "personalizes the issue." 


Point of view: The people who live in the rain forests are the best line of 
defense against their destruction. 


The film makers did not get involved in Hollywood's race for dramatic rights 
when Mendes, former president of Brazil's National Council of Rubbertappers, 
was slain in December, 1988. 


"We knew what we had and its value, and we had the support of his wife and 
indigenous organizations," Pena said. "So we stayed out (of the controversy)." 


Now the Film Project is lining up sponsors for a Dec. 7 benefit for the film at 
the Santa Monica Museum of Flying. Ed Asner, Kris Kristofferson and singer Don 
Henley are among those committed. John M. Wilson

JAPAN REPORTEDLY WON'T FINANCE CONTROVERSIAL AMAZON PROJECT 




From Times Wire Services 




WASHINGTON 




Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial 
highway through the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, according to a senior 
Republican senator. 


Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said Japan's ambassador to the United States, 
Nobuo Matsunaga, "assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to 
fund this highway." 


Many environmentalists oppose the project, known as BR-364, because they fear 
it will hurt the rain forest. It would link remote regions of the jungle in 
Peru and Brazil to bustling Pacific ports on the other side of the Andes, 
permitting raw materials such as lumber from the forest to be easily shipped 
abroad. 




U.S. Pressure Cited 


Kasten said he believes that pressure from the United States helped persuade 
Japan not to fund the road. 


"I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend 
to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement 
between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," Kasten added in a statement 
released Thursday. 


Kasten is senior Republican on the Foreign Operations subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan, 
as a leading source of development funds, has a responsibility to make sure 
that projects are environmentally safe. 


On Feb. 3, a team of senators pledged to try to block the jungle road after 
spotting evidence of it while touring the Amazon basin. They said construction 
equipment was already in place, awaiting the end of the rainy season in April. 


The huge Amazon rain forest is regarded as vital to the global environment. 
Scientists have warned that its destruction could deprive the world of an 
important source of oxygen and alter its weather patterns. Plants release 
oxygen during photosynthesis.

MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 




By ALEENE MacMINN, Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press. 




A Brazilian company has beaten out several Hollywood names for the rights to 
film the life of union leader and ecologist Chico Mendes, whose murder last 
December as he stepped out of his modest wooden house in the Amazon town of 
Xapuri focused world attention on the battle to save the Amazon rain forest. JN 
Filmes bought the rights for more than $1 million. Ted Turner, David Puttnam, 
Robert Redford and Paramount Pictures had expressed interest in filming Mendes' 
life story. The decision was made by Mendes' widow Ilzamar with other members 
of the Chico Mendes' Foundation, an organization created by Mendes' family, 
former colleagues and ecologists to continue his campaign to save the Amazon 
rain forests. ALEENE MacMINN

THE MARTYR OF THE RAIN FOREST; 


THE BURNING SEASON THE MURDER OF CHICO MENDES AND THE FIGHT FOR THE AMAZON RAIN 
FOREST BY ANDREW REVKIN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 511 PP.) 




By David M. Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park 
Service. 




We Norteamericanos are suddenly smitten with the Amazonian rain forest. Now 
that our passion burns so brightly -- and seemingly without end -- it is 
politically instructive to consider briefly how such a state of affairs came to 
pass in just a few years. 


Only a decade ago, biologists working in the tropics began to warn their 
colleagues that agricultural practices and development in tropical America were 
beginning to have an impact on some species, and that ambitious development 
plans such as the trans-Amazonian highway could lead to catastrophe for what 
was then the largest and most diverse uninterrupted biological community in the 
world. Anthropologists had begun to protest the progressive extinctions of 
native people both through loss of habitat and by direct genocide. 


By the mid-'80s, climatologists were contributing a new chord: the Greenhouse 
Effect, in which the burning of Amazonia was contributing carbon dioxide while 
eliminating one of the world's great storehouses of excess carbon. And perhaps, 
they suggested, clear-cutting would lead to irreversible desertification of one 
of the wettest places on Earth. 


We worried about trading golden lion tamarins in the forest for Brazilian beef 
for our hamburgers. Photographs of the scarring and burning from the space 
shuttle offered dramatic visuals. 


Now, as we enter the '90s, the world's bankers, agronomists and politicians are 
asking if there isn't a "softer path" for the tropics to develop, something 
more compatible with its own ecological rhythms. And finally the world's 
communications media have penetrated Amazonia in a big way, providing their own 
peculiar contribution of information and shallow, exploitative confusion. 


This last has meant -- as usual -- that the First World, especially America -- 
as usual -- has engendered an Amazonia in its own image, with noble rustics, 
exploitative capitalists, cuddly animals, graceful trees and miraculous powers 
of global salvation. Almost nobody north of the Equator knew who Chico Mendes 
was until he was murdered, but today he is the martyr of the rain forest. 


The best thing about "The Burning Season" is its insistence on complexity. The 
Amazon of our imaginings is a cartoon. Andrew Revkin, whose customary beats are 
science reporting for The Times and Discover magazine, demolishes that cartoon. 
His foil is Chico Mendes, the radical Brazilian rubber tapper (seringueiro) who 
fought deforestation to sustain the culture of his people, and who was adopted 
by the world's environmental avant-garde shortly before his predictable murder 
by ranchers as 1988 drew to a close. 


Revkin took a cram course in Portuguese, then spent a couple of months talking 
to people in the Amazon basin and another month getting to know the rest of 
Brazil. He invested enough time and consideration in his story to do what 
reporters are supposed to do but usually don't. He has constructed a 
representation of "reality" in multiple dimensions, in which the characters 
have motivations -- often multiple and imperfect -- and in which both the good 
guys and the bad guys get to tell their own stories and show themselves to be 
quite human. He tells enough of the history of Brazil and the Amazon and 
provides enough data about the geography, ecology and resources of the Amazon 
for an American to begin to get the picture. 


The gist of this story concerns the first indigenous counterforce that has 
arisen in Brazil to stem the deforestation of the Amazon. Until quite recently, 
most of the pressure to conserve arose from foreign environmentalists, who had 
started by crying alarm and had progressed, with only slightly more success, to 
applying pressure on Brazil by getting to the vast flow of North American and 
European capital that not only fuels development but keeps the Brazilian 
economy from collapsing in red ink. 


As conservationists slowly have come to realize, environmental protection never 
really succeeds until it is adopted by local people. In Brazil, the only "local 
people" who have had any say have been members of the traditional Latin 
American clique of autocrats who, abetted by First World capital, have achieved 
vast wealth at the expense of both human and natural resources. 


In the past, one of the greatest sources of Brazilian wealth was latex 
painstakingly extracted from the native rubber trees of the Amazon rain forest 
by the seringueiros for slave wages, but sold on the international market at 
vast profit. In South America, rubber trees must grow as a relatively scarce 
element of the intact forest, or else they are attacked by pests and diseases. 


"The Burning Season" focuses on the efforts of Mendes and his compatriot rubber 
tappers to organize themselves for economic survival. Once, that meant 
eliminating the middlemen who sucked most of the profits from the raw-rubber 
trade. Now, it is preserving the very forest where these hardy folk have carved 
a sustainable niche from harvesting rubber and Brazil nuts. In this, the 
mixed-blood seringueiros have of late discovered a natural alliance with the 
Indians, who likewise require the forest to survive and who have had even less 
political power than the tappers. 


The ranchers, their wealthy sponsors and their local lackeys have represented 
traditional right-wing power; the tappers, as they have learned to organize 
politically, have therefore found themselves naturally allied with leftist 
revolutionary forces in Latin America. But to view this as a struggle between 
left and right is to miss much of the point and most of the consequences. 


Contrary to the myth that Greens have constructed around Mendes, he was never a 
Brazilian John Muir. But he was a quick study, and rapidly learned the 
connection between the protection of the tappers' way of life and larger global 
desires to protect the rain forest. Smart, well-read and charming, he led his 
dispersed flock to political awareness, to alliances first within Brazil and 
later beyond its borders. 


Despite its rich store of insight, "The Burning Season" does not reveal what 
will happen to the Amazon. Brazil has recently become more democratic; even the 
wealthy and relatively conservative new president has shown a strong interest 
in environmental preservation and in protecting indigenous, non-destructive 
uses of the forest. On the other hand, the forest continues to fall and burn at 
a fearsome clip, and the meager economics of latex and Brazil nuts are not 
sufficient to save it. What Revkin does offer, and it is substantial, is the 
understanding necessary for any of us who care to contribute to a solution.

A SIGN OF HOPE FOR BRAZIL'S MASSES; 


A VERDICT REFOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE 2-MILLION-SQUARE-MILE AMAZON RAIN FOREST 




The conviction of two Brazilian ranchers on charges they plotted and carried 
out the murder of environmentalist Chico Mendes is not simply a vindication of 
the late union leader's life and work. It also is a sign of hope to Brazil's 
struggling masses and a challenge to those foreigners who have embraced Mendes' 
goal of preserving the 2-million-square-mile Amazon rain forest, the world's 
largest remaining tropical woodland. 


The killers were cattle ranchers whose plans to expand their holdings by 
burning forest lands were thwarted by the activities of the rubber-tappers' 
union Mendes founded. Rubber tappers live by extracting latex and gathering 
nuts. 


Since 1980, more than 1,000 members of unions and other peasant associations 
have been murdered in disputes with Brazilian landowners. Only twice before 
have the killers been convicted of their crimes. Human-rights workers hope the 
decision signals a break with Brazil's long history of judicial indifference to 
such outrages. 


The international outcry that followed Mendes' murder already has helped induce 
the Brazilian government to abolish the tax credits that made it profitable to 
convert rain forests to pastureland. It also has established a 2.4-million-acre 
"extractive" reserve in Mendes' memory, where 3,000 families earn their 
livelihood through the traditional gathering of latex and nuts. 


It remains to be discovered, however, whether Chico Mendes' many vocal admirers 
in the industrialized world were attracted by his values or his brief 
celebrity. This year alone, three books have been published on his life; a film 
biography is about to go into production. But long after those books have sunk 
to the bottom of dusty remainder piles and the movie has been relegated to the 
insomniac wasteland of late-night cable, Brazil still will be struggling to 
reconcile the needs of 150 million desperately deprived people with its 
obligation to be the responsible steward of an irreplaceable natural resource. 


Successful resolution of that struggle will require not only the vigilance of 
watchful scolds, but also the constructive advice and concrete assistence of 
generous friends.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 


CHICO MENDES . . . 




The people who killed Francisco (Chico) Mendes last month probably thought that 
they were ridding themselves of a problem. Instead they created a world-renowed 
martyr to the cause that he championed -- saving the vast and endangered rain 
forests of the Brazilian Amazon. 


Mendes had worked to protect the Amazon forests and their indigenous people for 
the last 12 years as the leader of a union of rubber tappers in Brazil's Acre 
state, an isolated region that borders on Peru and Bolivia. The tappers are 
forest dwellers who harvest natural latex from trees in the Amazon jungles to 
make rubber. Their work does not normally harm the forests, because the tappers 
give the trees enough time to replenish before the next harvest. 


The organization that Mendes helped them create has fought for the 
establishment of forest reserves in the Amazon where the tappers are free to 
work without encroachment by ranchers, who prefer to burn down the trees to 
make room for cattle grazing. Without official reserves, many tappers have been 
subject to intimidation by ranchers and other would-be settlers of the Amazon. 
As in the Wild West days of the United States, there is sometimes violence 
between ranchers and tappers. Mendes was aware of this, and traveled with 
bodyguards as a result. 


Authorities in Acre have arrested several suspects in Mendes' shooting death, 
including a prominent rancher and his two sons. While some press reports from 
the isolated state have suggested that Mendes died as a result of a personal or 
family dispute, his fellow environmentalists in Brazil are convinced that he 
was murdered to stop his work. They are demanding that the Brazilian government 
thoroughly investigate the killing. 


Perhaps more important, Brazilian environmentalists are using Mendes' death to 
galvanize public opinion in Brazil and to educate their fellow citizens about 
the danger that uncontrolled development poses to the Amazon -- the last great 
rain forest on Earth and a resource for the entire planet. A Brazilian 
colleague of Mendes in the environmental movement said recently that Mendes' 
death sparked "the first mass movement in defense of the Amazon." If that 
movement prods the Brazilian government toward greater efforts to protect that 
region and its rain forests, Mendes will not have died in vain.

CHICO MENDES: THE MAN WHO TRIED TO SAVE THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST; 


DEFORESTATION: STRUGGLING TO SAVE HOMES, LIVELIHOODS AND BRAZIL'S VAST RAIN 
FOREST, MENDES MADE A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR A LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE. 




By Andrew Revkin, Andrew Revkin, the author of The Burning Season: The Murder 
of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest (Houghton Mifflin), 
from which this article is excerpted, teaches at Columbia University's Graduate 
School of Journalism. 




NEW YORK 




In the rain forest of the western Amazon, the threat of violent death hangs in 
the air like mist after a tropical rain. It is simply a part of the ecosystem, 
just like the scorpions and snakes cached in the leafy canopy that floats over 
the forest floor like a seamless green circus tent. 


People from the Amazon say that the trouble always starts during the burning 
season, a period of two months or so between the two natural climatic seasons 
of the region -- the dry and the wet. By then, the equatorial sun has baked the 
last moisture out of the brush, grass and felled trees, and the people of the 
Amazon -- sometimes Indians and rubber tappers, but most often wealthy ranchers 
and small farmers -- set their world on fire. 


The fires clear the clogged fields or freshly deforested land and, in 
disintegrating vegetation, put a few of the nutrients essential for plant 
growth back in the impoverished soil. The burning season is the time before the 
return of the daily downpours that give the rain forest its name. 


The trouble arises when one man's fires threaten another man's livelihood. Most 
often, that happens when one of the hundreds of ranchers or speculators who 
have been drawn to the region's cheap land acquires the title to property that 
already is the home of people who have squatted there legally -- sometimes for 
decades. 


Often the new titles are acquired through fraud or coercion. And because the 
most efficient way to reinforce a claim to land in the Amazon is to cut down 
the forest and burn it, the new landlords do just that. Or they loose their 
cattle, which make quick work of the settlers' crops. If that does not work, 
they send out their pistoleiros to burn the families out of their shacks or, if 
they resist, shoot them down. 


The only thing that has prevented the Amazon river basin and its peoples from 
being totally overrun is its sheer size and daunting character. It is a shallow 
bowl covering 3.6 million square miles, twice the expanse of India. An average 
of eight feet of rain falls here each year, inundating great stretches of 
forest, turning roads into bogs, and providing vast breeding grounds for 
malaria mosquitoes. 


The water drains eastward through a fanlike network of streams and rivers that 
together disgorge 170 billion gallons of water each hour into the Atlantic -- 
eleven times the flow of the Mississippi. Besides producing this riverine sea, 
the deluge also nourishes the largest stretch of rain forest left on Earth. 


One of the tens of thousands of plant species in the forest is a tree with a 
smooth trunk that produces a white fluid in a reticulation of tubules beneath 
its bark. Its local name is seringueira; botanists call it Hevea brasiliensis. 
Its common name is the rubber tree. The fluid is thought to protect the tree 
from invasions of boring pests by gumming up the insects' mouth parts. 


This same fluid, congealed and properly processed, has remarkable qualities of 
resilience, water resistance and insulation to the flow of electricity -- all 
of which made it one of the most sought after raw materials of the Industrial 
Revolution. 


It was this substance, called latex, that lured the grandfather of Chico Mendes 
and tens of thousands of other men to the Amazon rain forest in two waves over 
the past 120 years. Called seringueiros, these men settled in the forests 
around ports like Xapuri and worked in solitude, fighting to make a life from 
the living forest -- and fighting to free themselves from bosses who saw to it 
that they remained enslaved by their debts. 


Recently, as outsiders intent on destroying the forest began to invade the 
Amazon, the seringueiros had to fight once again. This time, they were fighting 
to save their homes, their livelihood and the rain forest around them. 


In leading this struggle to preserve the Amazon, Chico Mendes had made a lot of 
trouble for a lot of powerful people. He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what 
Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the 
shipyard managers of Gdansk. The Xapuri Rural Workers Union, which Mendes 
helped found in 1977, regularly sent swarms of demonstrators to thwart the 
ranchers' chain-saw crews. 


With his aggressive tactics and fable, plain-talking style, Mendes had then 
attracted the attention of American environmentalists, who invited him to 
Washington and Miami to help them convince the international development banks 
to suspend loans that were allowing Brazil to pave the roads leading into the 
Amazon. Mendes made friends abroad, but he made more enemies at home. 


The Amazon was one of the last places where might still made right. In that 
sense, it differed little from the American West of the 19th Century as 
described in 1872 by Mark Twain in "Roughing It": "The very paradise of outlaws 
and desperadoes." 


In the Amazon, when you ask people about justica (justice), they simply chuckle 
in a sad kind of way; most of the men in the prison cells are sleeping off a 
drunk, having had several too many slugs of the blazing, strong sugar-cane rum 
called cachaca, which is sold for pennies a glass. In fact, more than 1,000 
people have been murdered in land disputes in rural Brazil since 1980, and 
Amnesty International estimates that fewer than 10 of the killers have been 
convicted and sent to jail. And not one mandante (mastermind) of a murder has 
ever been tried. 


In this anarchic atmosphere, the pistoleiros often assume the look of their 
imagined Wild West predecessors, strutting through town with a revolver stuck 
in the waist of tight jeans, boot heels raising red dust. 


Thus it was that in the latter half of December, the threats against Mendes had 
been replaced with death pronouncements. "Threat" implies that death is only a 
possibility; in Mendes' case, imminent death was a near inevitability. He was 
shot at close range with a .20 gauge shotgun when he stepped out his backdoor. 


The funeral of Mendes was held on Christmas Day. Through what the tappers call 
radio cipo -- vine radio, the rain forest version of the grapevine -- word of 
the murder spread quickly. Hundreds of rubber tappers hiked for many hours 
through the forest to attend the wake and funeral. 


By Christmas morning, more than a thousand people had crowded around the 
church. The rains had returned in force, drenching the mourners who followed 
the casket to the cemetery on the road leading out of town. Along with the 
hundreds of rubber tappers and small farmers in the procession were dozens of 
Mendes's friends from the other Brazil -- celebrities, politicians and labor 
leaders. Surrounding the crowd were dozens of journalists, many from overseas. 
An international version of vine radio had efficiently disseminated the news of 
the killing. 


The murder of Mendes might well have been an unremarkable event. He was the 
fifth rural union president murdered in Brazil that year, But over the previous 
three years, Mendes' closer relationships with environmentalists, labor 
organizers, and human-rights advocates from Brazil, the United States and 
Europe had focused increased attention on the struggle of the rubber tappers. 


As a result, this murder deep in the Amazon rain forest -- where it once took 
three weeks for news to travel down the river -- instantly became an 
international story, making the front page of newspapers around the world. 


The significance of his murder was further amplified by the disturbing 
environmental anomalies of 1988. The scorching summer in the United States that 
year had motivated politicians and the media for the first time to pay serious 
attention to the greenhouse effect, the theory that billions of tons of gases 
released each year by the burning of fossil fuels and forests are trapping 
solar energy in the atmosphere and disastrously warming the planet. 


And just as the heat was breaking records and fires were ravaging Yellowstone 
National Park, the television networks got detailed satellite photographs of 
the Amazon burning season -- thousands of fires burning simultaneously. It 
almost felt as if the heat and smoke generated in the forests were being 
inhaled on the baking streets of Los Angeles, Washington and New York. 


Then came the slaying of Mendes. In the months that followed, dozens of 
television crews, photographers and reporters from around the world would take 
the six-hour, four-stop flight from Sao Paulo to Rio Branco, the capital of the 
state of Acre, then bounce for four more hours along the rutted, dusty, partly 
paved road to Xapuri, the river town where Mendes lived. Visitors who stayed 
long enough to walk for a time in the surrounding forest discovered the bounty 
of the ecosystem that Mendes had died defending. It was a place of spectacular 
diversity and vitality. Turn over a log and find 50 species of beetle. Survey 
an acre and find 100 species of butterfly. In the Amazon, one type of rubber 
tree has exploding fruit that flings seeds 20 yards; three-toed sloths harbor 
dozens of species of insects and algae in their matted fur; river porpoises are 
cotton-candy pink. 


It was a living pharmacy that scientists had only just begun to explore. A 
fourth of all prescription drugs contain ingredients derived from tropical 
plants -- malaria drugs and anesthetics and antibiotics and more -- and less 
than 1% of the Amazon's plants had been studied. 


It became clear to outsiders that the murder was a microcosm of the larger 
crime: the unbridled destruction of the last great reservoir of biological 
diversity on Earth. Just a few centuries ago, the planet had 15 million square 
miles of rain forest, an area five times that of the contiguous United States. 


Now three Americas' worth of forest were gone, with just 6.2 million square 
miles left. One-third of the remaining rain forest was in the Amazon basin, and 
over the past decade alone, chain saws and fires had consumed about 10% of it, 
an area twice the size of California. 


The aggression against the forest was therefore a many-layered tragedy, causing 
human deaths, killing millions of trees and other organisms and resulting in 
the extinction of several species of plant and animal life each day -- most of 
which had not even been noticed, let alone catalogued or studied. In some ways, 
Mendes and the rubber tappers were simply another endangered species, as much a 
part of the ecosystem as the trees they tapped, the birds in the branches, or 
the ants underfoot. 


But the tappers were a species that was fighting back.

AMAZON ROAD 




Congratulations to the team of U.S. senators who are attempting to block 
construction of the road through the Amazon basin that the Japanese are funding 
("Senators Vow to Fight Japanese-Funded Amazon Road," Feb. 4, Part I). Japan's 
lack of natural resources and desire for easy shipment of the supplies should 
not lead to the destruction of one of the earth's major sources of oxygen. 


Many animals indigenous to the jungles will be displaced. In addition, once the 
road opens, rare tropical animals will be in danger of extinction due to 
hunters' increased accessibility of the area. 


It is understandable that the residents of the remote villages in the jungles 
of Peru and Brazil would be in favor of the road, but, as Douglas Jehl points 
out in his article, the governments of Brazil and Peru would allow further 
development and foresting for economic purposes, given the incentive. It would 
only be a matter of time before the rain forest disappeared completely if this 
were the case. 


The Japanese have already despoiled many other tropical rain forests, and they 
should be stopped before they transform the world's largest into a "concrete" 
jungle.

AMAZON PLAN UPSETS ENVIRONMENTALISTS; 


JAPAN WON'T FINANCE HIGHWAY IN RAIN FOREST 




From Reuters 




WASHINGTON 




Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial 
highway through the Amazon rain forests in Brazil, Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. 
(R-Wis.) said today. 


Kasten said he has received assurances from Japan's ambassador to the United 
States, Nobou Matsunaga, that Japan would not fund the highway, known as 
BR-364. Many environmentalists oppose the project because they fear it will 
harm the rain forest. 


"The ambassador assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to 
fund this highway," Kasten said in a statement. He said he believed pressure 
from the United States had helped persuade Japan not to fund the road. 


"I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend 
to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement 
between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," he said. 


"This particular project has, over the past several years, failed almost every 
(environmental) safeguard conceivable," Kasten said. 


Kasten is senior Republican on the foreign operations subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan, 
as a leading source of development funds, had a responsibility to make sure 
projects are environmentally safe.

THE LURE OF THE AMAZON 




By JACK MATHEWS 




The Amazon has been one of those fascinating locations that Hollywood has often 
gone to, without going there. In the old days, jungle sets were created on 
sound stages. 


But today's more sophisticated viewers expect the real thing and they got a 
pretty good look at the forests around Belem in John Boorman's 1985 "The 
Emerald Forest." 


With world attention focused on the South American rain forest, filmmakers are 
more anxious than ever to load up on inoculations and head for the jungle. 
Besides "At Play in the Fields of the Lord," the Amazon is being visited for 
these film projects: 


Amazon: an action-adventure story about a Finnish man who ends up in Brazil 
after pulling the plug on his comatose wife at home. Stars Finnish actor Kari 
Vaananen and Americans Robert Davi and Rae Dawn Chong. Finland's Mika 
Kaurismaki directs and co-produces. The film premieres in Finland next month; 
no American distributor has been set. 


The Stand: a love story from screenwriter Tom Schulman, reuniting director John 
McTiernan with his "Hunt for Red October" star Sean Connery. The film is 
scheduled to go into production in the Amazon in January. 


Rain Forest: a fictional story involving a Chico Mendes-like environmentalist, 
being written by Lewis John Carlino for producer Robert Redford. 


The Chico Mendes Story: No title has been determined for the Warner Bros. film 
that will be produced by David Puttnam from a script by William Mastrosimone. 
The script is based, in part, on former Times reporter Andrew Revkin's "The 
Burning Season," a current nonfiction account of the Mendes legend. JACK

SHORT TAKES; 


TEATRO AMAZONAS TO SING ANEW 




From Times Wire Services 




RIO DE JANEIRO 




Opera will be performed in the heart of the Amazon rain forest for the first 
time in more than 80 years when the legendary Teatro Amazonas reopens March 17 
after a three-year, $8-million restoration. 


The theater was built in the city of Manaus in 1896 at the height of Brazil's 
rubber boom. 


The rubber barons, who spoke French and sent their linen shirt cuffs to Lisbon 
to be laundered, spared no expense in building and furnishing the theater, 
believing their wealth would last forever. 


Opera companies from Spain, Italy and Portugal traveled across the Atlantic to 
perform in Manaus. 


The theater, however, staged its last opera in 1907, when Brazilian rubber 
began losing its markets to Far Eastern exporters. Teatro Amazonas then fell 
prey to termites and tropical storms. 


The latest renovation of the theater is its fourth, but it has not been used 
for opera since the 1907 closing. 


Opening night will feature excerpts of "Guarany," an opera by Carlos Gomes; the 
last scene of the Villa-Lobos ballet "Amazon Forest," danced by Brazil's 
premiere ballerina, Marcia Haydee, and a symphonic presentation of the poem 
"Statutes of Man," written by Amazonian composer Claudio Santoro. President 
Fernando Collor de Mello will attend opening night.

THE WORLD 




Eight nations of South America's Amazon basin called on wealthy countries to 
provide money for the preservation of the world's greatest rain forest and for 
the economic development of the region. At the first summit meeting on the 
Amazon, the governments said the funds should be provided without any strings 
attached. The presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname 
and Venezuela and the foreign minister of Bolivia met in Manaus, Brazil, and 
issued a "Declaration of Amazonia." The document, taking note of the world 
outcry over the onslaught on the forests, said the international attention paid 
to the Amazon should be converted into "measures of cooperation on the 
financial and technical levels".

BRAZIL RANCHER ADMITS KILLING AMAZON ACTIVIST 




From Reuters 




XAPURI, Brazil 




Brazilian rancher Darci Alves da Silva, in a dramatic and unexpected 
about-face, confessed in court today that he had shot dead rain forest activist 
Chico Mendes nearly two years ago. 


Darci, accused with his father, Darly, of the murder -- which drew worldwide 
attention to the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- had said they were 
innocent. But on taking the witness stand hours after the trial opened, Darci 
changed his plea: "I killed Chico Mendes," he confessed, adding that he had 
acted alone. 


"I fired one shot," Darci, dressed neatly in a white shirt and beige trousers, 
told the tiny, cramped courtroom in the Amazon village of Xapuri. 


His voice betrayed no hint of emotion as he spoke of the night of Dec. 22, 
1988, when he crouched in Mendes' back yard, ambushing the rubber tappers' 
leader as he emerged from his simple wooden house and firing one bullet into 
his chest. 


Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma, in Xapuri for the trial, told reporters that 
Darci's confession could be a tactic to try to get his father Darly, accused of 
ordering the murder, acquitted. Darci might also be trying to persuade the 
court that no one else was involved in the crime, Tuma added. 


Darci turned himself over to police within days of the killing of Mendes and 
confessed to the murder. He later retracted his confession, so today's 
admission was a stunning development. 


Foreign reporters and environmentalists were crammed in the tiny, 80-seat 
courtroom while townspeople stood outside in driving rain. White banners in the 
main square of this frontier town proclaimed "Justice to Save Amazon." 


Mendes was a local trade unionist who led rubber tappers in their struggle 
against the encroachment of cattlemen into the world's last great rain forest. 
Mendes' campaign made him enemies among the ranchers, and he predicted his own 
death. 


Security in Xapuri, a town of 5,000 people in the western state of Acre close 
to Bolivia, is intense. Police check everyone who enters the town. 


The tightest security has surrounded the main prosecution witness, 15-year-old 
Genesio da Silva, who has lived in hiding since 1989. Genesio da Silva, who 
used to live on Darly Alves da Silva's farm, is due to testify that he heard 
him plotting the murder. 


Human rights activists said the trial of Alves da Silva on charges of ordering 
the murder was virtually unprecedented in Brazil. Moacyr Grechi, the Roman 
Catholic bishop in Acre's state capital, Rio Branco, said that out of 1,200 
rural murders in Brazil between 1964 to 1986, no one was ever brought to trial 
for ordering a killing. 


But those close to Mendes question whether the right man is in the dock. They 
say Alves da Silva is a small fish in a large conspiracy that involved far more 
powerful people.

BRAZIL TRIES TO STOP SLASH-AND-BURN DESTRUCTION OF RICH AMAZON FORESTS 




By William R. Long, William R. Long is The Times' correspondent in Rio de 
Janeiro. 




PORTO VELHO, BRAZIL 




Here in the state of Rondonia on the southern flank of the great Amazon rain 
forest, a new frontier opened up in the late 1970s. Encouraged for a decade by 
the Brazilian government, hundreds of thousands of settlers came to help push 
back the wilderness and share the bounty. Rondonia was the land of opportunity, 
the Golden West of Brazil. 


Now the heady frontier spirit has faded and a new realism seems to be setting 
in. 


Slash-and-burn farming and ranching has stripped away as much as one-third of 
the forest that once protected Rondonia's soil from the baking sun and leaching 
rains. The state's jungle Indian population has dwindled from 40,000 to 5,000, 
according to a study by Brazilian anthropologist Cecilia Meireles. 


Small farmers who thought Rondonia promised an escape from poverty have failed 
to improve their lot. Malaria is a frequent visitor at makeshift rural homes. 
Porto Velho, the state capital, is crowded with slum dwellers who gave up on 
the land. Although the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a 
frontier development program called Polonoroeste, farmers have received little 
technical or financial aid. More than half the land they have cleared is 
uncultivated and has given way to a matted growth of secondary brush called 
capoeira. 


Like other areas on the Amazon frontier, Rondonia obviously hasn't turned out 
the way it was supposed to. Officials here don't need foreign conservationists 
to tell them that, but in the past year, European and American worries about 
destruction of the Amazon forest have poured down on Brazil like tropical rain. 
Perhaps because of the international pressure, perhaps because it makes sense, 
Brazilian authorities are adopting new policies aimed at slowing the 
destruction. Some conservationists are skeptical about the effectiveness of the 
policies, but at least on paper, preservation is becoming the new official 
watchword in the Amazon region of Brazil. 


President Jose Sarney has announced a series of protective measures in a 
program called "Our Nature." One new decree suspends official credits and tax 
breaks that had encouraged cattle ranchers to turn forest into pasture. The 
program also includes a zoning study that would put huge forest areas 
off-limits to ranchers, farmers, loggers and miners. 


The Rondonia state government already has its own zoning plan. Approved last 
June, it limits agricultural activities largely to central and southern areas 
of the state where most deforestation has taken place and where soils are 
richest. 


Vice Gov. Orestes Muniz, also Rondonia's planning secretary, says that by 
recovering millions of acres gone to capoeira, the state can save vast areas of 
virgin forest from the wasteful slash-and-burn cycle. Technicians are also 
experimenting with the use of capoeira as cover for crops that require shade, 
such as coffee and fruit trees. 


Muniz said the zoning plan sets aside about 60% of the state's territory as 
natural preserves. To enforce protective measures, the state police force has 
created a forest patrol unit that now employs 350 officers and eventually will 
have 1,000. A freeze on all deforestation is in effect, pending implementation 
of the plan. Thirty percent of the state is designated as extractive reserves 
and managed forests, where rubber, Brazil nuts, medicinal plants and selected 
hardwoods and other products can be harvested without deforestation. Officials 
say the potential for economic returns is great. Rondonia woodlands contain an 
estimated 40,000 plant species, only about a tenth of which have been 
classified and studied. Another 30% of preserved forest area includes natural 
parks and Indian lands. 


To implement the plan, the state is starting a program called Planafloro, with 
projects for education, technical aid and financing to help people to preserve 
the forest while exploiting its riches. 


"To the extent that the small producer gets income from the standing forest, he 
will not cut more down," said Teodorico Rocha, a federal official helping on 
the Planafloro. 


Planafloro will cost an estimated $213 million, and the national government is 
negotiating for a loan from the World Bank to cover part of the cost. Rocha 
said it is "absurd" for Brazil to increase the heavy burden of its $115 billion 
foreign debt, but the country cannot afford to pay for the conservation program 
by itself. 


"There is consciousness for preserving the environment in Rondonia," he said. 
"What is lacking are the means, financing." 


In an emotional speech this month, President Sarney appealed to foreigners who 
accuse Brazil of destroying the Amazon to help provide the means for preserving 
it. 


"Transfer technology to us without costs," Sarney said. "Help us to combat the 
burning with airplanes, with equipment, with products. Help us to reforest with 
material, scientific and human resources." 


Foreign aid alone cannot prevent further destruction in the Amazon by economic 
interests and ignorance, but Brazilians who want to save the forest need all 
the help they can get.

THE WORLD 




Brazil's President Jose Sarney announced a plan to protect the Amazon rain 
forest and castigated those who accuse Brazil of destroying the world's largest 
wilderness. Features of the plan include the creation of a national fund for 
environmental protection, suspension of subsidies for cattle ranchers in the 
Amazon Basin and new controls on pesticides. The government said the program, 
called "Our Nature," will have a budget of $178 million in its first year. "We 
are accused of something we cannot accept -- of destroying our own territory," 
Sarney said. "Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage."

GREED AND GLUTTONY IN THE FOREST PRIMEVAL; 


THE FATE OF THE FOREST: DEVELOPERS, DESTROYERS AND DEFENDERS OF THE AMAZON BY 
SUSANNA HECHT AND ALEXANDER COCKBURN (VERSO: $24.95; 254 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 




By David Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park Service. 




For those of us -- most, I think -- who know little of South American history, 
Susanna Hecht and Alexander Cockburn provide a comprehensive and scholarly, if 
not disinterested, political and economic history of tropical South America. 
"What is now called the environmental destruction of the Amazon is merely the 
latest surge in a long epic of annihilation," writes Hecht, an agronomist in 
the UCLA Graduate School of Planning, and Cockburn, enfant terrible and 
left-wing British journalist. 


The developed world confronts its own complicity in tropical devastation. Hecht 
and Cockburn argue that only a "socialist ecology" can save the Amazon. Whether 
that analysis is correct or not, they offer -- at last -- an overview of the 
situation, not as some idiosyncrasy of this fading century but in the context 
of a South American history few Norte Americanos, including conservationists, 
know anything about. 


Nearly a century before Charles Goodyear discovered how rubber could be 
stabilized through vulcanization in 1842, the latex sap of Hevea brasiliensis 
and its relatives was already in world trade as waterproofing for a vast array 
of materials. By mid-19th Century, it was the focus of Brazil's economy, and by 
the end of it, American business interests that would eventually include Henry 
Ford and Daniel Ludwig began their Brazilian adventures. 


The boom in rubber, until its collapse when purloined seeds reached their 
maturity in other tropical regions, led not only to great fortunes but 
development far up the Amazon River into the eastern foothills of the Andes. 


Despite astronomic surges and catastrophic plunges in the Brazilian economy, at 
the end of the World War II, the Amazonian forest was little different than it 
had been at the time of European discovery. But then began a geometric process 
that in 40 years would lead Amazonia to the brink of catastrophe. 


To Cockburn and Hecht, this was no consequence of overpopulation, no failure of 
"inappropriate technology." It was the product of foreign capital conspiring 
with Brazilian elites living outside Amazonia -- neither of whom had any 
interest in its welfare -- attempting to extract maximum wealth from the region 
and with virtually no interest in the consequences. 


The Indians and the rubber-tappers -- the seringueiros -- of Amazonia, and for 
that matter the landless peasants who comprise most of the remainder of 
Brazil's populations, never have had a real say in their country's fate. Even 
the government's grand scheme to build a Trans-Amazonian highway and other 
roads to provide access to the rain forest, even Brazil's Homestead Act of the 
1970s that granted land to peasants, were cynical projects designed to pacify 
both peasants and forest dwellers (the former could shoot the latter), while 
the real money was in the vast fazendas that cut and burned huge sections of 
forest to facilitate mining or grazing operations. 


Without doubt, the trouble in Amazonia is not some simple product of Malthusian 
dynamics. As the authors note, most of the settlement programs of the region 
have failed. But clearly it does have something to do with Brazil's autocratic 
and class-stratified society, and with the vast debts those autocrats have 
incurred with First World banks while sending their own capital abroad. 


This is mostly about money and power, not ecological ignorance. Building walls 
around parts of the forest and declaring them ecological sanctuaries, or parks, 
or refuges will not work, has not worked anywhere in the Third World. The new 
civilian government of Jose Sarney has shown some interest in sharing power 
more broadly -- including even those who actually make their homes in the 
forest. Hecht and Cockburn think this is the only answer: Those who live within 
and draw their lives from the forest can be enfranchised to be its best 
protectors, can be aided and encouraged to preserve its spectacular biotic 
treasure. 


The tropical forests may or may not be the salvation of the Earth, but they are 
clearly extraordinary biological communities. Because their solar energy, 
moisture and climatic stability are ideal for life, these places support not 
only the highest biomass, but through biological competition the most diversity 
on the planet. 


It is no accident that tropical rain forests are the primary source of new 
pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals, as well as genes for all manner of 
enterprises -- these are all the consequence of fierce biological competition 
sustained over millions of years of natural selection. They are also a vast 
pool of carbon that, converted to gas, will cook the Earth while eliminating 
its capacity to recover. 


"The Fate of the Forest" is in the hands of the developed world. Our insatiable 
consumption of raw resources -- especially wood pulp and energy -- is the 
principal engine driving tropical deforestation. 


Hecht and Cockburn make a potent case that rock concerts and debt exchanges 
have little to do with saving Amazonia; they merely reflect our shallow 
understanding of global economics. We can trim our own resource gluttony and 
the extravagant standard of living that makes our protestations to the Third 
World ring hollow, and we can invest in conservative technologies that will not 
only reduce our own consumption, but which we can share with the tropics.

RAIN FOREST TEACHES CHILDREN LESSON IN LIFE 




By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 




For Beverly Revness and Janice Tarr, the school year that ended Friday was a 
long, difficult and tumultuous one, but comments from students like 10-year-old 
Natasha Roje give them hope that it was not all in vain. 


"I wonder, if I have children," Natasha told a classroom visitor recently, "if 
they'll ever get to know about the rain forests, or if they have to see 
pictures and stuff." 




Small-Scale Triumph 


Revness and Tarr, teachers at Kenter Canyon Elementary School in Brentwood, 
have spent the year raising the environmental consciousness of their fourth- 
and fifth-graders with a joint project for the two classes. 


While many parents, teachers and students will remember the 1988-89 school year 
as the year of a teachers strike that highlighted the many troubles facing 
urban public education, others may prefer to find hope in the small-scale 
triumphs that take place in classrooms such as this one. 


Drawing from a range of public and private resources, Revness and Tarr 
assembled a year-long environmental awareness project for their classes which 
will be entered in a federal competition sponsored by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. The program, drawing hundreds of applicants a year, 
recognizes 10 precollegiate projects around the nation for outstanding service 
to the environment. Winning entrants are honored with a three-day trip to 
Washington. 


Together, the Kenter Canyon teachers fashioned a year-long curriculum centered 
on what scientists say is one of the most serious threats to the world's 
environment: the destruction of the globe's tropical rain forests. 


Back in September, most of the children would have been unable to even locate 
such forests on a map. Now, many show a remarkable grasp of some of the complex 
issues at stake. 


In one recent class, for example, they talked about how some American fast-food 
chains contribute to deforestation by obtaining their beef from cattle raised 
cheaply on cleared tropical land in South America and Indochina. At one point, 
some of the students announced that they would boycott the chains that did so. 
On other occasions, the students have written the heads of the International 
Monetary Fund and the U.S. Commerce and Agriculture departments to urge a halt 
to policies that encourage economic exploitation of such lands. 




Students Bused In 


The Kenter students, despite the school's location in affluent Brentwood, are 
relatively representative of the Los Angeles school district. About one-third 
of the 500 children are bused in from overcrowded inner-city areas. The student 
body is about two-thirds white, 21% Latino, 8% Asian-American and 7% black. 
Slightly more than one-sixth of the students have been designated to have 
limited English proficiency. 


Spoken to individually, the children in Revness and Tarr's classes are eager to 
explain what they have learned in lessons throughout the year. 


"They're cutting down all the rain forest trees and they're burning them," says 
9-year-old Dana Horstein. Citing a makeshift textbook of environmentalist 
publications assembled by her teachers, she says rain forests are being 
destroyed in the tropics at the rate of 50 acres per minute. 


Environmentalists caution that at the current rate of use, such forests will be 
completely cut down by 2050, at devastating cost. Up to half the life forms on 
Earth live in the affected regions, including key sources for many drugs, such 
as those used to combat childhood leukemia. Scientists also caution that 
burning the trees amounts to a double-barreled contribution to global warming 
-- the so-called "greenhouse effect." Combustion adds pollutants and carbon 
dioxide to the atmosphere, while removal of trees decreases the planet's 
ability to absorb the gas, believed to be the key factor in trapping the sun's 
heat in the atmosphere. 


Developers clear the forests for lumber, cattle-grazing land and commercial 
development. 


"By cutting down the trees it's going to make it hotter . . . and it'll be all 
gone and it'll be really hot," Dana adds. 




Making Pollution 


Rene Ramirez, 9, says: "I don't know, when they're cutting down the trees, if 
they're thinking." 


"I think they should . . . be more careful about it," adds Maiko Morishita, 10. 
"If they cut down the rain forest and burn it they're making pollution." 


"What I'm looking for when I'm teaching this course is to make these kids 
become trustees of the environment," says Revness, 60. A 25-year supporter of 
the Sierra Club and member of Greenpeace, the Audubon Society and World 
Wildlife Fund, Revness initiated the Kenter project and is a three-time 
recipient of a California teaching award for environmental awareness. 


"We have assumed an activist role. The children unfortunately do not have the 
money to join these organizations, but in spirit any time that they can work on 
(related projects) they do," says Revness. "You see, the first thing you have 
to do is motivate the children. And then it becomes a matter of education. . . 
. I just don't want them to grow up and feel 'This isn't happening around here 
and so this isn't happening (at all).' " 


The curriculum for the yearlong course drew from a wide variety of sources. 
Revness and Tarr, with the part-time assistance of June Carter, an 
undergraduate geography major at UCLA, used National Geographic videotapes in 
conjunction with several outings to the Los Angeles and San Diego Zoos to show 
children tropical wildlife, much of which faces extinction if deforestation 
patterns continue. 




Animal Habitats 


Later, zoo docents visited the classroom to lecture in more detail about animal 
habitats and food chains. 


Pamphlets from environmental groups such as the Rainforest Action Network or 
the World Wildlife Fund supplemented classroom materials depicting the tropical 
ecosystem, while the teachers adapted environmental themes for discussions and 
lessons ranging from social studies to art. 


The heart of the yearlong project is a 4-by-6-foot scale model of an Amazonian 
rain forest created by the students. Using paint, Mylar, acetate, clay, 
Popsicle sticks, rubber bands and such, the students assembled a forest scene 
including a cattle pen, aboriginal inhabitants, loggers, road-builders and 
native animal species. 


"We did the animals," said Maiko and Natasha proudly. 


Carter took Revness's fifth-graders and Tarr's fourth-graders on field trips to 
collect pebbles and branches for the model, while helping them design the 
forest based on maps and textbooks. One student's retired grandfather helped by 
donating labor and craft work. 


"This is kind of unusual for fourth- and fifth-grade classes to do," says 
Kenter Principal Suzanne Westmoreland. "It went into an area of geography into 
depth. The children were really learning about the fragile balance of ecology." 




Learn By Doing 


"It's kind of a 'learn-by-doing' project," says Revness, who says the students 
learned more by physically reconstructing what they had been taught. 
"(Environmentalism) doesn't exist in a vacuum." 


The model's designers like to talk about their work. 


"We're trying to show how dumb it is to put the cattle in the rain forest 
because the tigers and the lions just eat the cattle," says Philip Anson, 11. 
"You have to be aware" of the issues, says Philip. 


Others take a more reflective stance. Sometimes, "you just feel you can't do 
anything" when confronted with the scope of international actions, Natasha 
says. But her own formula for countering hopelessness reflects Revness' 
personal guideline. 


"What I look for in students is passion and commitment," says the teacher, who 
began her career concentrating on civics and U.S. law. 


For Natasha, the responsibility is clear. "You start thinking your vote can 
count, and then you make more letters and phone calls until you get more people 
to do something."

NAMES IN THE NEWS; 


STING LOBBIES FOR BRAZIL INDIANS 




From Times staff and wire service reports 




BRASILIA, Brazil 




British pop star Sting met Brazilian President Jose Sarney on Wednesday for the 
second time in less than a year to lobby for the nation's Indians. 


Accompanied by Kaiapo Indian chief Raoni, with whom he toured the globe to 
raise funds last year, Sting asked that lands be demarcated for the Kaiapo 
tribe in the Amazon state of Para. 


Before the meeting at the presidential palace, Sting told Reuters that he would 
tell Sarney that he was also concerned about the fate of the Yanomami Indian 
tribe in the state of Roraima. 


The Yanomami are the biggest forest tribe left in the Americas, but the 7,000 
who live in Roraima are dying from malaria and other diseases brought there by 
some 40,000 gold prospectors. 


"I'll tell him (the president) the killing of the Yanomami must stop," Sting 
said. 


On Tuesday Brazil announced that the government had negotiated a peaceful 
departure of the prospectors. 


Sting last year founded the Foundation Mata Virgem (Virgin Forest) with a view 
to preserving the Amazon rain forest and its native people. His spokesmen said 
the singer had raised more than $1 million for the cause during his travels.
