MALCOLM X 




It is indeed a good thing that Malcolm X's life and teachings are receiving 
attention from a new generation ("The Rebirth of Malcolm X," by Charisse Jones, 
Feb. 4). I have taught all my students -- Afro-American, Asian, Latino, white 
and "other" -- about his teachings for years. 


But to idly dismiss the many years that Malcolm X was a racist is to miss part 
of what makes him such a great inspiration. He came to understand that the 
color of a person's skin is not the basis on which a person should be judged 
good or bad, friend or enemy. 


It is ironic and sad that 25 years later, the leader of the very same church 
whose then-leader may have been behind Malcolm X's assassination -- the Nation 
of Islam -- still preaches the hate Malcolm X came to repudiate and loathe. One 
can only hope that middle-class and, more important, young Afro-Americans, as 
well as all young Americans, tune into all of what Malcolm X said and stood 
for, and not just take parts of his message and legacy out of context.

NATION IN BRIEF; 


NEW YORK; 


MALCOLM X SLAYING SITE PLANS ADVANCE 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




The New York City Planning Commission unanimously approved Columbia 
University's controversial plan to build a bio-medical research center at the 
Audubon Ballroom, site of Malcolm X's assassination. 


But the commission ruled that the school must preserve about 40% of the 
ballroom in Washington Heights, including the stage where Malcolm X was slain 
as he made a speech in 1965, and the building's original facade. It also set 
limits on the level of hazardous materials at the facility. The plan now goes 
before the Board of Estimate.

YOUR FAMILY TREE!: MYERS COMES FROM MANY SOURCES 




By MYRA V. GORMLEY 




Question: Could you tell me something about the surname Myers? I know that many 
people of different nationalities have this name, but my line came from 
Maryland and I have them traced back to the early 1800s. 


Answer: You are correct about the name having several origins. However, Myers 
or Myer frequently came from Germany. It means an overseer or head servant and 
later meant a farmer -- thus its popularity as a surname. It also is an English 
surname, sometimes spelled Mires. It derived there as a locality surname 
meaning "at the mire (swampy, low-lying land, or bog)." In England it was a 
north-English surname. In America, the name could have come from ancestors from 
this area in England or from German or German-Jewish ancestors. 


In Jewish names with a combination of "Meyer," such as Meyeroff, they are 
usually an elaborated form of Meir (meaning "light" in Hebrew, according to 
some sources). Some forms of this surname would be: Meyerfeld, Meyerheim, 
Meyers, Meyerstein, Meyerhardt and Meyersicht; many may have been shortened to 
Meyer. According to Dan Rottenberg in his "Finding Our Fathers, A Guidebook to 
Jewish Genealogy," he lists Meyers, Meier, Meyerowitz, Meierovics, Meyerson, 
Myer, Myers, Myerson and Meir as Ashkenazi names taken from the Hebrew word for 
"wise" or "scholarly." 


Q: I am interested in finding an authentic copy of my family coat of arms. 
Could you recommend a reputable company from which I could obtain this? 


A: Coats of arms were not granted to families, but rather to individuals and 
only diligent research and careful documentation will determine whether you are 
entitled to such. The Augustan Society, P.O. Box P, Torrance, Calif. 
90507-0210, offers a search of coats of arms for a fee of $15. You will need to 
know the name and the primary residency. 


The research department of this society will make photocopies of as many 
references as found to arms for individuals bearing the surname you give, but 
it will not undertake to prove your genealogical connection to the individuals 
who have borne the arms of any it locates. 


There are several commercial companies that market reproductions of coats of 
arms to Americans. However, just because there is a coat of arms with the same 
surname as yours does not mean that you are related to the person who bore 
those arms.

TV REVIEW; 


RIVETING 'MEETING' ON 'AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE' 




By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 




"Malcolm." 


"Reverend." 


Contemporary dramatists are inevitably intrigued by the "what ifs" of history, 
ranging from a merging of Che Guevara and Evita Peron in "Evita" to a fictional 
conversation between Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that forms 
the basis for Jeff Stetson's play, "The Meeting." 


The "American Playhouse" production of the latter airs at 9 tonight on Channels 
28 and 15. 


Although essentially a replay of civil rights rhetoric from the 1960s, "The 
Meeting" is a fascinating exercise in speculative theater, featuring stellar 
performances by Dick Anthony Williams as Malcolm X and Jason Bernard as King in 
a contained environment perfect for TV. 


This is that fine actor Williams' third turn as Malcolm X, the first coming in 
the miniseries "King," the second in the Off-Broadway production of "The 
Meeting." Effectively directed here by Bill Duke, he and Bernard tap the 
conflicts that separated and the common denominators that joined these civil 
rights leaders from clashing worlds. 


King, the Southern, small-town Baptist minister who answered racism with 
nonviolence, now looms as an epic figure in American annals. Malcolm X, the 
street-bred leader whose relative militancy terrified the white Establishment, 
is today a blurry footnote. 


Both were assassinated at age 39. Would they have ultimately united? Stetson 
apparently thinks so. 


"The Meeting" takes place on Valentine's Day, 1965, the day after Malcolm X's 
house has been bombed. The setting for the meeting, requested by Malcolm X, is 
a Harlem hotel room where a nervous Malcolm X awaits King with his scary, 
suspicious bodyguard Rashad (Paul Benjamin). 


The civil rights leaders begin by parrying. Malcolm X to King: "Still the 
dreamer." King to Malcolm X: "Still the revolutionary." 


They arm wrestle. They word wrestle. They lecture. They shout. They implore. 
Malcolm X to King: "At least -- at least -- get angry!" King to Malcolm X: "You 
want to free blacks; I want to free Americans!" 


As it turns out, the meeting itself becomes a sort of liberating experience, 
with the acrimony between the two men ebbing and softening. They share 
laughter. They share dreams. They share mountaintops. They share a goal. And 
looming above all else, they will share a grim fate. 


And what of the fates of the children whom King and Malcolm X, in their 
different ways, sought to free from the cycle of poverty keeping them in 
economic bondage? 


That's the question you ask yourself while watching Karen Goodman's wonderful 
short film, "The Children's Storefront," which immediately follows "The 
Meeting" tonight. 


It's a brief but profound glimpse at a nonprofit, independent storefront school 
in Harlem for "the very, very poor urban black children" who have already been 
written off by the rest of society. Some were born to drug-addicted parents. 


"The Children's Storefront" is a sparsely narrated documentary that omits basic 
information about the school's financing, its process of selecting students and 
its record of achievement or failure in its 13 years existence. 


More importantly, what Goodman does do is capture hope tempered by realism. You 
see inquisitive young children wanting to learn. You see intelligence. You see 
spirit. You see bright eyes. And you wonder if the brightness will remain. 


Is the school too little too late? "At what moment is the die cast?" asks the 
narrator. 


More than anything else, "The Children's Storefront" shows us how far we've 
come since the year of that fictional meeting between King and Malcolm X. And 
how much further we have to go.

Channel 28 tonight.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: GERMAN ANCESTOR'S ENGLISH NAME 




By MYRA V. GORMLEY 




Question: My ancestor, William Felton, was born in the lowlands of Germany 
about 1770 and arrived in America in 1776 with his parents and two older 
brothers, John and Robert. The parents supposedly died shortly thereafter, 
probably in Pennsylvania. What puzzles me is that Felton is not a German name, 
and I have been unable to find this family on ship passenger lists from 
Germany. My ancestor was bound to a man who raised him in the Presbyterian 
faith. Is it possible he took another name? 


Answer: Anything is possible in genealogy. Felton is an English location name; 
from Old English meaning feld (pasture or open country) plus tun (enclosure). 
It also is spelled Felten, and to add to the confusion, there is a German 
surname spelled Felten or Feldten. 


However, with sons named John, Robert and William, I suspect your family is of 
English origins even though your ancestor supposedly was born in Germany. 


You need to make a thorough check in the probate and orphans' court records in 
the county where your immigrant ancestors died. Therein may be additional 
information on this line's origins. 


Ship passenger records are not complete for this time period. Examine the 1790 
Census for Felton and Feltin families. There were 53 heads of households with 
this surname -- most of them in New England, but four were in Pennsylvania at 
that time. The older brothers probably were heads of household when the 1790 
Census was taken, and it may be necessary to research them to learn more about 
your ancestor. 


Q: My maiden name was Musick, which my father says may have been of Czech 
origin. I have seen it spelled Muzik also. Great-grandpa was born in Missouri 
about 1856 in St. Joseph or Jefferson City. Do you have any clues to this 
name's origins? 


A: Musick or Music is Polish for peasant or vassal. However, Muzik is Czech -- 
an affectionate nickname for a man of short stature. 


These names would have sounded alike to American record-keepers, so your family 
tradition of being Czech is most likely correct. Since your family settled in 
Missouri in the mid-1800s, they probably came during the time of mass 
immigration of Czechs -- who came due to the drought and crop failures in the 
1840s and a revolution in 1848. Possibly your family left from the ports of 
Hamburg or Bremen in Germany and sailed either to New York or Galveston, Tex. 
Many Czechs settled in small towns and villages in Missouri. Examine the 1850 
and 1860 census records of Missouri for more clues; and check for 
naturalization papers. Look for all spellings of your name. 


Q: Can you tell me the origins of the surname Hendricks? 


A: Hendricks, also found spelled Hendrick, Hendrich and Hendrix, is of German 
origins, meaning a descendant of Heinrich, the German form of Henry, which 
literally means "home, rule." German surnames were originally formed from two 
roots that often have unrelated meanings. 


Q: My surname is Fant, which I seldom find. My folks were Swedes, but this name 
does not sound Swedish. Is it? 


A: Fant has some English roots, as a nickname, meaning an immature person, one 
with the characteristics of a child. However, the name could have been derived 
from "Infante" of Italian and Spanish origins. 


How your father's Swedish family came to acquire this name will require a 
fascinating research into genealogical records.

STAGE REVIEW; 


KING AND MALCOLM X TAKE A 'MEETING' 




By MARK CHALON SMITH 




"The Meeting" is what if theater, as in what if Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Malcolm X sat down in a cozy hotel room in 1965 and discussed the civil rights 
struggle. 


As directed by Adleane Hunter for the Orange County Black Actors Theatre as 
part of its observance of Black History Month, Jeff Stetson's play offers 
intriguing possibilities: Could these men have joined in a common strategy for 
the movement? Could they have gotten along as leaders? They were, after all, 
men with very different perspectives. 


A disciple of Thoreau, Gandhi and Christ, King used nonviolent civil 
disobedience in his efforts to win hearts and to influence minds. Malcolm X, 
meanwhile, spoke of aggression and the need to meet fist with fist, gunshot 
with gunshot. Turn the other cheek? Like hell, man. 


Unfortunately, Stetson lets fantasy go too far, creating an idealized vision 
that smacks of contrivance: Malcolm X (Bingwa) discovers that King (Curtis 
Thomas) has brought his daughter a doll to replace the one she lost when their 
home was firebombed, and suddenly, all heat between the men dissipates. Malcolm 
X finds himself marveling at what he and King could do as "a team." The play 
ends with a handclasp of understanding (harking back to an arm-wrestling match 
earlier) that goes beyond respect to approach near-mawkish affection. 


Director Hunter can be criticized for taking this happy ending and pumping it 
up to made-for-television dimensions but, in her defense, it does seem in line 
with Stetson's fable-like writing. It's obvious that we are supposed to leave 
the theater feeling good about these two legends; "The Meeting," in the end, is 
less about black history than it is about black pride. 


Stetson sees Malcolm X as more than a charismatic leader, passionate social 
thinker, uncompromising avenger and former prisoner. He paints him with 
humanistic strokes, as a man who also had a sense of humor and who harbored a 
great love of family. 


In the production's best performance, Bingwa shares Stetson's vision and 
presents a wise and, though temperamental, relatively reasonable firebrand. 


When, for instance, his fuming bodyguard (Tahlib McMicheaux) sarcastically 
berates him for meeting King, Malcolm X takes it all in stride. 


Because King is more familiar to most of us, Thomas has a bigger challenge in 
making the role his own. And -- unlike Bingwa, who resembles Malcolm X somewhat 
-- Thomas looks nothing like King. Still, Thomas is able to evoke the 
character, focusing on King's strength and famous patience. King is the 
immovable object to Malcolm X's irresistible force, and Thomas communicates 
this resolve. 


'THE MEETING' 


An Orange County Black Actors Theatre production of Jeff Stetson's drama. 
Directed by Adleane Hunter. With Bingwa, Curtis Thomas and Tahlib McMicheaux. 
Set and lighting by Arnold Brumbly. Sound by George Hammond. Costumes by 
Wendell Carmichael. Plays at 8:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday and at 7 p.m. Sunday 
at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center, 931 N. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. Tickets: 
$12-$15. (714) 667-7090.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: NAME ORIGINS CERTAIN AND UNCERTAIN 




By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 




Question: Are you aware of any information on or publications about the Steele 
or Steel surname? 


Answer: Steel/Steele is an interesting old English surname, but authorities 
disagree as to its origins. For information about the Steel(e) Family News, 
write to the publication at 813 Forest Ave., Plymouth, Mich. 48170. 


Some name experts say Steel/Steele is a locality name -- meaning one who came 
from Steel, a stile or place where one has to climb. The northern English 
pronunciation makes stile sound like "steel," and it is the name of places in 
Northumberland and Shropshire. 


Others claim it is a baptism name, meaning "the son of Steel," from the old 
Danish "Staal," or derived from an occupational name for a steelworker. Its 
origins may have come from the Old English, a metonym (nickname) meaning 
firmness and reliability. The surname is found as early as 1273 in English 
records where it was spelled Stele. 


Q: What does the German name Klatte mean and could you recommend a book on this 
subject? 


A: Klatte or Klatt means "one with tangled or disheveled hair." Sources are 
"New Dictionary of American Family Names" by Elsdon C. Smith (try your local 
library for this reference) and Hans Bahlow's "Deutsches Namenlexikon" (in 
German). 


Q: I would like to know where the name Alston originated. I think it is 
English, as my father was born in Australia around 1900. 


A: Alston is an English locality name meaning one who came from Alston (the 
village of one whose name began with Al -- the name of several places in 
England) and dates back as early as 1273 in English records. It also is what is 
known as a font name (based on the father's name) meaning "noble," and in Old 
English was from Athel -- elf/old/temple stone. 


Q: Can you tell me anything about the surname Noble? What is its nationality? 


A: Noble is of English origins, primarily -- meaning an illustrious or famous 
person; one possessing dignity; of high birth or exalted rank. However, it was 
a name sometimes given ironically -- in other words, a nickname. However, there 
was a le Noble family of Normandy dating back to as early as the 12th Century. 


Q: Could you tell me something about the names Duke and Dunn? I believe both 
are Irish. I know nothing about this type of research. 


A: Duke is an English name meaning descendant of Duke -- a pet (nickname) form 
of Marmaduke (sea leader; steward) -- and was spelled le Duc in early English 
records. Dunn (also spelled Dunne, and in Ireland O'Duinn or O'Doinn) is Irish, 
meaning the dark-brown-complexioned one or grandson of Donn (brown). O'Dunne 
(or O'Doyne) is one of the most numerous of surnames in the midland counties of 
Ireland. 


To learn about the origins and meanings of your family names check at your 
local library for dictionaries on the subject -- one of the best is New 
Dictionary of American Family Names by Elsdon C. Smith.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 27 (CTK) -- In passing today a law 
enabling ethnic minorities to use Christian names and surnames 
in their original form, the Slovak parliament met one of the 
main demands by the Hungarian minority and the Council of Europe. 
  Seventy-two deputies of the 124 present voted in favor of 
the 
law, 48 were against it, two abstained from the vote and two did 
not vote. Immediately after the passage of the law, deputies 
from the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of 
parliament for a symbolic five minutes, in protest against the 
decision. 
  "Although the law does not exactly correspond to our wishes, 
it is in line with them," Arpad Duka Zolyomi, a deputy from the 
ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, told CTK. He welcomed the 
fact that from now on Hungarian women would be allowed to use 
their surnames without the "Slovak" suffix of -ova, and 
Christian names registered in their Slovak forms may be 
rewritten into Hungarian, for example Bela instead of Vojtech. 
  Chairman of the SNS group of deputies Miloslav Kona said 
that 
it was an advantage of Slav languages to be able to clearly 
indicate a feminine surname. "Now I register the effort to wipe 
out this advantage. It is unacceptable," Kona said. "I do not 
think anybody is disqualified for using his (her) surname in 
line with Slovak language rules," he added.

  [Text] Moscow April 4 ITAR-TASS -- The archival documents 
containing records indicating that the father of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia, was a Jew, "were fabricated by the special services of 
Kazakhstan, probably on personal instructions from Nursultan 
Nazarbayev". This was announced by LDPR press secretary 
Grigoriy Serebrennikov in response to ITAR-TASS request to 
comment on the report of the ASSOCIATED PRESS news agency. 
  According to AP, Zhirinovskiy appealed to the Alma city 
executive committee for a change of his original surname of 
Eidelstein and was permitted to assume his present surname in 
June of 1964. 
  "Vladimir Volfovich's enemies cannot rest in peace. This 
time they launched a lie about Zhirinovskiy's bearing the 
surname of Eidelstein until the age of eighteen, and that, 
consequently, he is a half-Jew. As evidence, an archival record 
is cited, which must have been concocted by the special services 
of Kazakhstan, maybe on personal instructions from Nazarbayev 
who recently did not allow Zhirinovskiy to come to Almaty to 
attend the burial of his aunt," Serebrennikov said. 
  Any person who is versed in Russian law in the least knows 
that first of all, to change one's name one must submit a 
request in writing. No one has a copy of such a request 
because they do not know whose handwriting to forge, 
Serebrennikov said. Secondly, every Soviet citizen is obliged 
to receive a Soviet passport at the age of 16. Consequently, if 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy changed his surname after graduating from 
school, when was eighteen, he was obliged to get a new passport. 
No archival records of a new passport have been found 
anywhere," he stressed. 
  "In the circulated Xerox copies of a record in the register 
of civil status in Almaty there are many discrepancies. For 
instance, a wrong address is indicated. And in the so-called 
archival reference, the year of birth is wrong". 
  The press secretary of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the main 
evidence of the falseness of the document was the fact that 
"three days before the alleged change of name, Zhirinovskiy 
arrived in Moscow to enter a higher school."

MALCOLM X: THE GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS
text by Thulani Davies
Stewart, Tabori and Chang Pounds 14.99, 167 pages
MALCOLM X, eternally a black hero, was the part-white child of an unhappy
family whose inherent brutality denied him both security and self-respect.
He became a teenage hustler, a scared kid, a swaggering thief who struggled
to conquer his many fears. Imprisoned at the age of 20, he slowly improved
himself. Motivated by an extraordinary effort of will, he became an
autodidact, an ascetic, a campus debater and a popular philosopher.
Released six-and-a-half years later, he devoted his considerable energy to
the Nation of Islam, a black religious movement many of whose tenets were
unrecognisable to true Islamic scholars. It was headed by the Reverend
Elijah Muhammad, who quickly recognised the talents of his new recruit and
made him his national representative. Malcolm soared above his origins to
become one of the important political figures of his time. He proved to be
the most effective minister the Rev Muhammad had ever recruited; even
Cassius Clay, who came in much later as Muhammad Ali, could never replace
Malcolm.
The story ends as the final act in a familiar American tragedy. Rev
Muhammad, like other founders of idiosyncratic American churches, turned out
to be a disappointment: the philandering head of a wealthy clan whose income
was the flow of cash from his followers. He fiercely defended his lucrative
crown against what he perceived to be the threat of usurpation by Malcolm X.
Yet it was Malcolm who achieved immortality by dying a martyr, assassinated
in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965. He was not yet 40.
Bruce Perry's scholarly book seeks to demythologise Malcolm's autobiography.
Its fascination lies in its analysis of the hero's early life, first as
Malcolm Little, then as convict. It exposes his internal contradictions. To
some of the observers quoted in its pages Malcolm X was so fair-skinned as
to be almost mistaken for white, a proposition both supported and belied by
photographs in Malcolm X: The Great Photographs. He made headlines by
preaching for Rev Muhammad against 'white devils', yet eventually abandoned
his racism and acknowledged that not all whites were evil. His autobiography
depicts him as a family man; Perry piles on the evidence that suggests he
was cold, often cruel, to women.
It is not surprising that some of his posthumous admirers manipulate his
memory in the interests of politically correct propaganda. I have not seen
Spike Lee's film, but his book reproduces the screenplay by James Baldwin
and others. This appears to ignore Perry's findings, perhaps in the
interests of further mythologising the myth.
It needs no such assistance. It is right to acknowledge his greatness, but
not to deny the complexities and inner tensions that arise from his tortured
character. His achievements are a matter of record, but so is his career as
a political chameleon. During most of his publicly-witnessed lifetime
Malcolm was known as a black nationalist, a preacher for black separatism,
and an anti-white, sometimes anti-Semitic, rabble-rouser. In his later
years, when he had abandoned much of this, he joked that his contribution to
the civil rights movement was that he frightened the white establishment
into accepting the integrationist demands of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr.
Perry knows that history will be more appreciative than that. Malcolm X
'mobilized black America's dormant rage and put it to work politically', he
writes. 'He made African-Americans feel proud of their color. In his effort
to fashion a remedy for his self-hatred, he fashioned one for them.'

 [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and 
date not given: "The Law on Registers Could Serve as an Example 
for Other States"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary deputies yesterday passed one of the 
laws that the Slovak Republic pledged to adopt on its admission 
into the Council of Europe -- the law on [birth, marriage, and 
death] registers. We asked Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement Chairman Vojtech Bugar for his opinion on the law. 
  [Pankovcinova] Some Movement for a Democratic Slovakia

"anti-Slovak" and walked out of parliament as a sign of protest. 
Could you explain the gist of this law? 
  [Bugar] They labelled as anti-Slovak articles 15 and 18, 
which state that, if someone wishes to have his first name 
entered in his mother tongue, the first change of the name in 
the register is free. Likewise, if a woman wants to have her 
surname entered in her documents in the mother tongue, without 
the suffix -ova [characterizing female surnames in Slovak], this 
law allows her to do so free of charge the first time. An 
amendment specifying the usage of the first name and the surname 
also passed in parliament. This means that the first name and 
the surname in the mother tongue (that is, without the suffix 
-ova) will be used in the spoken and written Slovak language 
with the ending -ova and will be inflected according to Slovak 
grammar rules. Therefore, it is absolutely okay when a Slovak 
speaker will refer to my wife as Mrs. Bugarova. She will only 
have the chance to have her surname entered in her identity 
papers as Bugar. 
  [Pankovcinova] Are you satisfied with the adopted law? 
  [Bugar] Yes. Parliament adopted a very liberal law and 
complied with the recommendation of the Council of Europe. The 
present and future governments will be able to appear at 
international forums with dignity because this law could serve 
as an example also for other states in which there are ethnic 
minorities.

LIZ SMITH: FORBES' SERVICES OFFER A REFLECTION OF HIS LIFE 




By LIZ SMITH 




Malcolm Forbes' memorial services in New York at St. Bartholomew's Church on 
Thursday included most of the things he had liked best -- the swirl of 
bagpipes, the choral hunting horns and the men in red coats imported from 
France to play them, the discipline and devotion of his four adult sons and his 
daughter, each of whom spoke the only personal words in the epic-long (1 hour 
and 45 minutes) Episcopal service. Malcolm would have been proud of these 
children because not one of them broke down, though others watching did as they 
said their farewells to the man they called "Pop." 


A baby cried through some of the service -- one of Malcolm's progeny, I have no 
doubt. He'd have liked that, too. His huge family filled seven rows in front on 
the right, and behind them were hundreds of Forbes' employees. And Malcolm 
would have, of course, liked the titans of industry who came to say goodby, men 
such as John Kluge, Allen Neuharth and Lee Iacocca. And the presence of the 
former mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Malcolm would have adored all the police 
uniforms, as well as the claque of booted motorcycle bikers in the back of the 
church. Then there was the soft, ongoing click and whir of cameras from an 
overhanging balcony crammed with "social historians." Malcolm would have 
insisted on it, in fact. 


THE PUBLISHER, editor, writer would have enjoyed the Rev. Thomas Bowers' 
reminder that we are all dust and that John Dunne's bell tolls not just for 
Malcolm, but for you and me, too. 


There were lots of famous women, and Malcolm liked famous women. There was 
Katharine Graham of the Washington Post and Barbara Walters of television and 
Brooke Astor of philanthropy and Joan Rivers of fun, games and comedy. Malcolm 
would have embraced a service where we got to sing all six, full verses of "The 
Battle Hymn of the Republic" (it's never done) with all the "Glory, Glory, 
Hallelujahs" in between. He loved music. 


Malcolm would have smiled over the waiting crowds, the police barricades, the 
fanfare on Park Avenue and the snarl of Manhattan traffic. 


AND I think, most of all, he'd have loved the fact that he had a President of 
the United States and one of the greatest film legends who ever lived sitting 
next to each other in the front row. Former President Richard Nixon came with 
his daughter, Tricia Cox, and they were joined just before the service began by 
a subdued Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared from a side door. She looked quite 
beautiful and smiled sadly at the children's remembrances. 


But as the service ended and Glenn Ellison's bagpipes, playing "Amazing Grace," 
faded away, I saw Nixon lean toward Taylor and heard him say, "I want to thank 
you for the joy and beauty, the help and companionship, the enthusiasm and 
wonderful times you brought to the latter part of Malcolm's life as a friend." 


If this was eavesdropping -- and it was -- I couldn't help it. And I know 
Malcolm would want every such scrap recorded for posterity. Oh, Malcolm, you 
canny Scot, we'll never see your like again! 


THE CBS rumor mill is agog over the newcomer co-host of "CBS This Morning" -- 
Paula Zahn -- and "her extraordinary contract," plus the fact that her start-up 
has been so sensational. Plus the fact that she'll get to sub for Dan Rather 
when he is anchors away. Plus the fact that she has two specials written into 
her future.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
approved today the draft law on registration offices which makes 
it possible for the ethnic minorities to use their first names 
and surnames without having to adopt Slovak forms. The leaders 
of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians have demanded that the law be 
passed. Its adoption was among the conditions Slovakia pledged 
to observe when it was admitted to the Council of Europe (CE) 
last June. The law in force, passed under former Meciar's 
cabinet, did not fully comply with the CE conditions. 
  The members of ethnic minorities will be allowed to write 
their first names and surnames as it is usual in their 
languages, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. This means 
that the female surnames will not have to add the Slovak suffix 
"ova," and may retain the Hungarian suffix "ne." "Retroactive 
change in first names and surnames, stipulated by the law, will 
be free of charge," Pittner told CTK. 
  After the law is passed, there will remain only one unmet 
pledge to the CE: bilingual names of the communities inhabited 
by ethnic minorities. Last autumn Meciar's cabinet decided to 
remove bilingual (mostly Slovak-Hungarian) signposts, replacing 
them with only Slovak ones.

TV REVIEW; 


CBS' 'MALCOLM TAKES A SHOT' SCORES SOME SERIOUS POINTS 




By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




An unusually fine cast and a few glimpses of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (as himself) 
fire up today's serious "CBS Schoolbreak Special," "Malcolm Takes a Shot" 
(Channels 2 and 8 at 3 p.m.). 


(The show was originally scheduled to air in March, but CBS postponed it 
because its plot is disturbingly close to events surrounding the death of 
Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers, who collapsed on the court just 
two days before the program was to air.) 


John Clair is Malcolm, the hotshot of the high school basketball team, whose 
celebrity status makes him slight the importance of schoolwork and teamwork. 
His waking thoughts are all for basketball, and he's confident of an athletic 
scholarship, even though he's letting his class work slide. At night he dreams 
of going one-on-one with Abdul-Jabbar. 


When he suffers an epileptic seizure during a game, his dream becomes a 
nightmare. He is withdrawn and angry, until a friend (Gregory (Mars) Martin, in 
an especially nice turn) helps him reassess his priorities. 


Lending weight to the proceedings are Tony Lo Bianco as the concerned coach, 
Susan Ruttan as a dedicated teacher, Mario Van Peebles (who also directed) as a 
doctor who dispenses information about epilepsy, and Margaret Avery as 
Malcolm's mother. 


Clair is more than just a handsome young face; he's believable as a teen who's 
baffled and angry at what life has dealt him, then finds his real strength. 


Bob Gookin's script and Van Peebles' direction give events a natural feel, even 
though, as usual in these afternoon, youth-targeted message shows, everything 
is tied up neatly at the end of the hour.

CHAPLIN (12) Richard Attenborough
MALCOLM X Spike Lee
THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL (U) Brian Henson
MO' MONEY (15) Peter MacDonald
COOL WORLD (12) Ralph Bakshi
Charlie C and Malcolm X. Only through the world-shrinking,
history-scrambling quirks of movie production could the two have ever come
together.
Films about real people are called 'bio-pics': partly, one suspects, because
they are grown with the fertiliser of artistic presumption. Take a famous
fellow - Chaplin, Emile Zola, Napoleon, Gandhi, Malcolm X - and water him
with a few drops of liquid feed compounded from (equal parts) wild surmise,
canonisation and a democratising Everymanness.
Then watch your hero grow from someone real, measurable and idiomatic into
someone bland and generic enough to command a two or three-hour movie. Sir
Richard Attenborough's Chaplin is all about a handsome chap with curly hair
and quirky accent (it starts Elephant and Castle cockney, it ends Belgravia
posh) who floated through Hollywood between 1914 and 1952. Much of the time
this chap appears bewildered: partly because his life has been scripted by
four different people - Bryan Forbes, William Boyd, William Goldman and
(uncredited) Tom Stoppard - and partly because he is impersonated by a
fifth, Robert Downey Jr, who is brilliant when allowed to clown, comatose
when not.
Yet Chaplin, for all its faults, is a gust of pleasure compared with Malcolm
X. This, coming to British screens shortly, was witnessed by me a week ago
in Los Angeles. In the bio-pic cosmos Spike Lee's film is Yang to
Attenborough's Yin. Where Chaplin is a victim of innocence, stumbling into
aesthetic voids in the course of a well-meaning search for the Little Chap's
tragicomic essence, Lee's film is a disingenuous bland-out. Hustling its
hero through recent political history, it dodges controversial issues like a
soldier serpentining between bullets on a battlefield.
In both films the real-life subject is replaced by an expanded
glamorisation. But where Attenborough falls hapless victim to the
ineluctability of commercial movie tradition - gotta have a hero you can
like and understand rather than someone too prickly or protean (like Chaplin
himself) - Spike Lee uses that hagiographic trend as a propagandist tool.
In the role of race-war hate prophet Malcolm X he has cast Denzel
Washington, black cinema's Mr Nice Guy, best known for sweetening Steven
Biko in (Attenborough's) Cry Freedom. As a result, there is no sense of the
acrid aggressiveness with which the real Malcolm X played to black crowds
but which might, of course, have sent white audiences hurtling from the
cinema.
Malcolm X the movie, like Chaplin, pretends to portray a switchbacking life.
The civil rights leader did recant his own hate arias in late career,
converted to a gentler propagandism shortly before his own assassination.
But the conversion is meaningless - or impactless - in a movie where we
scarcely sense those hate arias to begin with. Even Malcolm X's notoriously
approving response to Kennedy's killing - 'The chickens have come home to
roost' - is camouflaged in a montage sequence where sounds and images are
pixillated to distract us from their content.
Chaplin owes its switchbacking structure to a different conversion: the
hero's change from silent-era supercomic to showbiz celebrity mugged by
history. This was not just movie history - the dooming effect of the sound
era on a performer whose work was grounded in mime - but political history.
Chaplin the man fell foul of the postwar American epidemic of anti-Communism
and Chaplin the movie suggests that even some of his troubles with women -
notably a litigious paternity suit - were the dark work of the FBI.
Could be true. But then almost anything in Chaplin could be true. Framing
the story with Swiss-set scenes of a white-haired Charlie discussing his
memoirs with his publisher (Anthony Hopkins), Attenborough and his scribes
make the film a giant flashback as if to say to the audience, 'Dispute what
you like. This is an old man's recall, not holy writ.'
Yet having taken this licence, they fail to use it interestingly. Charlie
recalls, it seems, only in cliches. His Ma (Geraldine Chaplin) is a
draggle-clothed cockney with a Monty Python line in penurious household
budgeting ('Sorry, it's only fish-'eads again, me darlins'.) The great
swashbuckler Doug Fairbanks (Kevin Kline) is introduced - yes - swinging
from a chandelier. And silent director Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) is a
photo-fit assemblage of bullhorn, barking command and work mottoes designed
to tickle modern audiences' hindsight laughter ('I never make more than two
pictures a week').
The cartoonish approach might have earned its passage, if sustained and
intensified. But as Chaplin himself ages, so does the film's style. With the
comic practitioner pushed aside by the serial husband and suspected commie,
all the initially animated Robert Downey can do is to stand centre-screen,
arteries stiffening as he is assailed by a sirocco of subplots. Allowing
Chaplin to be his own first-person narrator - which may have seemed an
inspired idea at first - ends up playing straight into the hands of Bad
Bio-pic Practice. The hero freezes into a bland reactive icon, surrounded by
a cast of compensatingly exaggerated movers and shakers.
Throughout both Chaplin and Malcolm X we long for glimpses - and
occasionally get them - of the real man behind the movie surrogate. Each
time the real comedian or activist crackles forth from some old newsreel,
high-diving into a slapstick pond or haranguing from a fiery podium, we
suddenly see or hear what we have been missing. Danger. Surprise.
Attraction. Revulsion. Hilarity. Outrage. All those uneven, vivid,
corrugated emotions that are crushed smooth by the genuflecting gestures of
the bio-pic.
Meanwhile, Christmas draws on apace. And what more seasonal than The Muppet
Christmas Carol, directed by Brian Henson, son of the late great Jim? This
has Michael Caine's Scrooge adrift in a Victorian London packed with rats,
frogs, pigs, bears and creatures beyond description. Most of these animals
are gifted with the power of speech: not least the Great Gonzo as one
'Charles Dickens.'
This is very enjoyable and absurd for about 30 minutes, after which drama
and sentiment take over. Jerry Juhl's script becomes too obsequious to the
original, leaving the Muppets to mug frantically in the few seconds they get
between the Scrooge-and-ghost set pieces. Kermit gulps away prettily as Bob
Cratchit. Fozzie Bear shines for a millisecond as factory-owner 'Fozziwig.'
But Miss Piggy, wasted as Emma Cratchit, practises a porcine sneer in
preparation for better roles.
Mo' Money is a cops-and-robbers comedy scripted by black star Damon Wayans
(The Last Boy Scout). Wayans and real-life brother Marlon play two
knockabout con persons who, between scams, help the police expose big
business corruption. Fearlessly democratic in its offensiveness, the film
lampoons lawmakers and lawbreakers alike: not to mention cripples, junkies,
mental patients, paranoiacs, para-feminists, whole-earthists, half-earthists
and Uncle Tomism and all. It is so ill-behaved it is almost charming. Or am
I just suffering from pre-Christmas concussion?
Cool World may have contributed to that state if I am. Imagine a cartoon
dimension where migrated humans (Brad Pitt, Gabriel Byrne) turn into painted
likenesses of themselves and where painted nymphets long to depart so they
can turn into real earthy beauties. One such nymphet departs to become Kim
Basinger. But the strain proves too much and she returns to cartoondom.
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz The Cat, Lord Of The Rings) designed and directed this
live-action/animation folly, which is every bit as whimsical, circular and
one-idea as it sounds.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X AS TOLD TO ALEX HALEY 
(BALLANTINE: $5.95) 




By CHARLES SOLOMON 




Twenty-five years after his assassination, Malcolm X remains a compelling, 
charismatic figure whose life has become the subject of renewed interest. Works 
by many young black artists feature references to him, including Spike Lee's 
hit film, "Do The Right Thing," and "Self-Destruction," a rap song by the group 
Stop the Violence; while the wire-framed glasses like the pair he wore are 
often referred to as "Malcolms." 


His searing autobiography forms a journey that unconsciously mirrors "Pilgrim's 
Progress": from his childhood in the rural South, through his life as a 
drug-pushing hustler in Harlem, his term in prison and his role as spokesman 
for Elijah Muhammad's racist doctrines, to his spiritual growth through Islam 
that broadened his vision and enabled him to embrace all of humanity. Had 
Malcolm X lived longer, he undoubtedly would have helped to lead America toward 
genuine racial equality during the last quarter-century. Unlike many '60s 
icons, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," with its double message of anger and 
love, remains an inspiring document.

POP EYE 




By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 




BLACK CAESAR IS BACK: M. C. Hammer may be on top now, with L. L. Cool J making 
a run at him, but wait -- who's on deck, ready to throw down the year's hardest 
rap attack? None other than Big Daddy Kane, who returns next week with a wildly 
eclectic new album, "Taste of Chocolate." The record has a killer dance track 
("Keep 'Em on the Floor"); a plea for black positivity ("Who Am I"), which 
features Malcolm X's daughter, Gamilah Shabazz, and "Big Daddy vs. 


Dolomite," an outrageous dozens-to-the-death insult duel between Kane and Ray 
(Dolomite) Moore, the legendary black comic. Kane also teams up with Barry 
White on "All of Me," a silky duet where White provides Big Daddy with the kind 
of paternal romantic advice that Humphrey Bogart offered Woody Allen in "Play 
It Again, Sam." As always, Kane's cheeky wordplay reigns supreme, especially on 
"No Dam Good," a Kane critique of some old girlfriends. Dissing his ex-playmate 
Monique, Kane realizes her wardrobe says it all: "Bamboo earrings, all big and 
looking silly, with extensions hanging down like Milli Vanilli."

ODD, BENT, ROAR ARE GOOD NORSE NAMES, BUT SCOTT AND RUSSELL ARE OUT; 


SCANDINAVIA: SURNAMES, MIDDLE NAMES AND FIRST NAMES RUN INTO MYRIAD RULES 
DESIGNED TO PREVENT CONFUSION AND PRESERVE CULTURE. 




By DOUG MELLGREN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




OSLO, Norway 




Norwegians can name a son Odd, Bent, even Roar, but Scott and Russell are 
beyond the law. 


Danes need middle names to tell each other apart, since half the people share 
14 surnames. 


In Sweden, middle names are unusual. Swedes are allowed as many first names as 
they want, however, and some use two last names. 


Every baby must be registered, with name officially approved, in the highly 
regulated societies of Europe's far north. 


Names like Bent Worm, Roar Bull or Odd Ones sound fine to Scandinavians, but 
the rules bewilder some parents. 


Take Becky Carlsson, a 30-year-old American living in Sweden. She has tried for 
12 months to get her maiden name, Hincks, approved as a middle name for her 
14-month-old son, Samuel. 


"They wouldn't accept Hincks as a second first name, or a middle name," said 
Carlsson, who has appealed the case. 


Sam could be a Hincks if his mother had continued to use her maiden name; the 
law says a Hincks and a Carlsson may have a baby named Hincks Carlsson, but two 
Carlssons cannot. Hincks is forbidden as a first or second name because it is a 
surname. 


"All this regulation started because a lot of names were being casually used," 
said Anne Svanevik, a Norwegian name researcher. "Officials were trying to 
stabilize things so it would be easier to find people in files, for example." 


Scandinavians often adopted the name of a farm or region, which they might 
change like an address if they moved. 


They created new surnames by adding "sen" or "son" to the father's given name. 
A Danish Jens, son of Hans, became Jens Hansen. His son Per took the name 
Jensen, the grandson became Persen, and so on. 


Chaos reigned by the mid-1800s and governments insisted that everyone adopt a 
permanent family name. Iceland is an exception; patronymics persist among the 
island's 250,000 people. 


New rules brought forth lists of legal last names, reserved family names, 
surnames available to anyone and acceptable given names. 


Each year in Sweden, thousands of Johanssons, Anderssons and Svenssons ask to 
change their names, which are so common that mix-ups are inevitable. Each must 
apply to the Patent and Registry Board for permission. 


About 20,000 of Norway's 4.2 million people change family names each year. 


"Norway passed a forename law in 1923 because people started to use last names 
as first names, and to protect children from having names that sounded 
strange," Svanevik said. 


An 1828 decree inadvertently stripped Danes of a rich variety of informal 
surnames, leaving 70% with names ending in "sen," said Gillian Fellows-Jensen 
of Denmark's Institute of Names Research. 


"The government said everyone had to have a permanent last name," said 
Fellows-Jensen, who was allowed by a 1983 reform of the law to hyphenate her 
name. 


"They didn't mean just the 'sen' names. It was up to the local vicar to record 
names. A lot of vicars weren't very imaginative and wrote down the easiest one: 
the patronym." 


Hundreds of Danes now have the same first and last names, creating an identity 
problem that can follow them to the grave. Tombstones are inscribed "Mr. 
Managing Director Jensen" and "Mr. Unskilled Worker Jensen" to distinguish the 
occupants. 


In Oslo, a city of 480,000 people, 50 of the 4,000 Hansens in the telephone 
book are named Hans and hints are provided, like Hans the surveyor, Hans the 
retired, Hans the bricklayer. 


Scott, Russell and some others are registered as surnames in Norway and cannot 
be used as given names. Immigrants are given leeway, however, and usually can 
register non-Nordic first names like Hussein or Carlos without problems. 


"I know a Norwegian family who wanted to name their baby Scott and were 
refused, while Scott was approved for another family with one British parent," 
Svanevik said. 


At the Swedish population registry, Thomas Erikson said: "We respect whatever 
name people had when they moved to Sweden. Their children born here have to 
abide by Swedish law." 


Erikson said Carlsson's difficulty arose because Hincks clearly is a surname. 


"If she could show that it was used anywhere as a first name it would probably 
be all right," he said. 


Carlsson even tried to smuggle the middle name into Sweden. 


"We went home" to Hartford, Conn., "and had him baptized Samuel Hincks 
Carlsson, then we filed to change his name here," she said. 


It didn't work. 


"In the eyes of the Swedish state, he's still Samuel Carlsson, but God knows 
he's Samuel Hincks Carlsson," said Sam's father, Mats.

 For purposes of paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section, if the S corporation contributes any assets to the partnership
during the recognition period and the S corporation held the assets as of the beginning of the recognition period,
the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is
determined as if the assets were contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using
the fair market value of each contributed asset as of the beginning of the recognition period). The contribution does
not affect whether paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section applies for taxable years in the recognition period before
the taxable year in which the contribution was made.

(iii) 



Anti-abuse rule.



 Paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section does not apply if a corporation forms or avails of a partnership with a principal
purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374. 

(6) 



Section 704(c) gain or loss.



 Solely for purposes of section 1374, an S corporation's section 704(c) gain or loss amount with respect to any asset
is not reduced during the recognition period, except for amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss with
respect to that asset under this paragraph.

(7) 



Disposition of distributed partnership asset.



 If on the first day of the recognition period an S corporation holds an interest in a partnership that holds an asset
and during the recognition period the partnership distributes the asset to the S corporation that thereafter disposes
of the asset, the asset is treated as having been held by the S corporation on the first day of the recognition period
and as having the fair market value and adjusted basis in the hands of the S corporation that it had in the hands of the
partnership on that day. 

(8) 



Examples.



 The rules of this paragraph (i) are illustrated by the following examples.












Example 1. Pre-conversion partnership interest.



 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $25,000 and a value of $45,000. In 1996, P buys
Whiteacre for $50,000. In 1999, P sells Blackacre for $55,000 and recognizes a gain of $30,000 of which $15,000 is included
in X's distributive share. P also sells Whiteacre in 1999 for $42,000 and recognizes a loss of $8,000 of which $4,000
is included in X's distributive share. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), X's $15,000 gain is presumed
to be recognized built-in gain and thus treated as a partnership 1374 item, but this presumption is rebutted if X establishes
that P's gain would have been only $20,000 ($45,000^$25,000=$20,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of
the recognition period. In such a case, only X's distributive share of the $20,000 built-in gain, $10,000, would be
treated as a partnership 1374 item. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(4), X's $4,000 loss is not treated as
a partnership 1374 item because P did not hold Whiteacre on the first day of the recognition period.





Example 2. Post-conversion contribution.



 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns (among other assets)
Blackacre with a basis of $100,000 and a value of $200,000. On January 1, 1998, when Blackacre has a basis of $100,000
and a value of $200,000, Y contributes Blackacre to partnership P for a 50 percent interest in P. On January 1, 2000,
P sells Blackacre for $300,000 and recognizes a gain of $200,000 on the sale ($300,000^$100,000=$200,000). P is allocated
$100,000 of the gain under section 704(c), and another $50,000 of the gain for its fifty percent share of the remainder,
for a total of $150,000. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), if Y establishes that P's gain would have been
only $100,000 ($200,000^$100,000=$100,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of the recognition period,
Y would treat only $100,000 as a partnership 1374 item. 





Example 3. RBIG limitation of $100,000 or $50,000.



 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $100,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $50,000 and a value of $200,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $200,000 and recognizes a gain of $150,000
of which $75,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $35,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $110,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $75,000 except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation
is $100,000, X's partnership RBIG of $75,000 is not limited and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $110,000
($35,000+$75,000=$110,000). However, if X had a RBIG limitation of $50,000 instead of $100,000, X's partnership
RBIG would be limited to $50,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and X's net recognized built-in gain would
be $85,000 ($35,000+$50,000=$85,000). 





Example 4. RBIL limitation of $60,000 or $40,000.



 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $60,000. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $225,000 and a value of $125,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $125,000 and recognizes a loss of $100,000
of which $50,000 is included in Y's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. Y's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $75,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $25,000. Thus,
Y has a partnership RBIL of $50,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because
Y's RBIL limitation is $60,000, Y's partnership RBIL for the year is not limited and Y's net recognized built-in gain
for the year is $25,000 ($75,000^$50,000=$25,000). However, if Y had a RBIL limitation of $40,000 instead of $60,000,
Y's partnership RBIL would be limited to $40,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section and Y's net recognized
built-in gain for the year would be $35,000 ($75,000^$40,000=$35,000).





Example 5. RBIG limitation of $0.



 (i) X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership
P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $25,000. 

(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are_

(b) X itself has_ 



(1) Recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and 

(2) Recognized built-in capital loss of $90,000. 



(ii) X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $40,000 and with partnership
1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000+$25,000=$65,000). Thus, X's partnership RBIG is $25,000 for the year except as limited
under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation is $0, X's partnership RBIG of $25,000 is limited
to $0 and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $40,000.







Example 6. RBIL limitation of $0. 



(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. Y owns a 50 percent interest in partnership
P with a RBIG limitation of $60,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. 



(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are_





(1) Ordinary income of $25,000; and 

(2) Capital loss of $90,000. 



(b) Y itself has_ 



(1) recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and 

(2) recognized built-in capital gain of $75,000. 



(ii) Y's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $115,000 ($40,000+$75,000=$115,000)
and with partnership 1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000+$25,000=$65,000). Thus, Y's partnership RBIL is $50,000 for
the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because Y's RBIL limitation is $0, Y's partnership
RBIL of $50,000 is limited to $0 and Y's net recognized built-in gain is $115,000.







Example 7. Disposition of partnership interest. 



X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $200,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $140,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $140,000 and recognizes a gain of $120,000
of which $60,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $95,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $155,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $60,000. In 1999, X sells its entire interest in P for $350,000 and recognizes a gain of $250,000.
Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, X's recognized built-in gain on the sale is limited by its RBIG limitation
to $140,000 ($200,000^$60,000=$140,000).







Example 8. Section 704(c) case. 



Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y contributes Asset 1, 5-year
property with a value of $40,000 and a basis of $0, and an unrelated party contributes $40,000 in cash, each for a 50 percent
interest in partnership P. The partnership adopts the traditional method under &sect;1.704&hyph;3(b). If P sold
Asset 1 for $40,000 immediately after it was contributed by Y, P's $40,000 gain would be allocated to Y under section
704(c). Instead, Asset 1 is sold by P in 1999 for $36,000 and P recognizes gain of $36,000 ($36,000^$0=$36,000) on the
sale. However, because book depreciation of $8,000 per year has been taken on Asset 1 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Y is allocated
only $16,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($40,000^(3&times;$8,000)=($16,000^$0)=$16,000) under section 704(c). The
remaining $20,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($36,000^$16,000=$20,000) is allocated 50 percent to each partner under section
704(b). Thus, a total of $26,000 ($16,000+$10,000=$26,000) of P's $36,000 gain is allocated to Y. However, under
paragraph (i)(6) of this section, Y treats $36,000 as a partnership 1374 item on P's sale of Asset 1.







Example 9. Disposition of distributed partnership asset. 



X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a fifty percent interest
in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $40,000. On January
1, 1998, P distributes Blackacre to X, when Blackacre has a basis of $20,000 and a value of $50,000. Under section 732(a)(1),
X has a transferred basis of $20,000 in Blackacre. On January 1, 1999, X sells Blackacre for $60,000 and recognizes
a gain of $40,000. Under paragraph (i)(7) of this section and section 1374(d)(3), X has recognized built-in gain from
the sale of $20,000, the amount of built-in gain in Blackacre on the first day of the recognition period. 







&sect;1.1374&hyph;5 



Loss carryforwards.





(a) 



In general. 



The loss carryforwards allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in gain under section 1374(b)(2) are
allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other loss carryforwards,
such as charitable contribution carryforwards under section 170(d)(2), are not allowed as deductions against net
recognized built-in gain.

(b) 



Example. 



The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example.












Example. Section 382 limitation. 



X is a C corporation that has an ownership change under section 382(g)(1) on 

January 1, 1994. On that date, X has a fair market value of $500,000, NOL carryforwards of $400,000, and a net unrealized
built-in gain under section 382(h)(3)(A) of $0. Assume X's section 382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) is $40,000.
X elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1998. On that date, X has NOL carryforwards of $240,000 (having used
$160,000 of its pre-change net operating losses in its 4 preceding taxable years) and a section 1374 net unrealized
built-in gain of $250,000. In 1998, X has net recognized built-in gain of $100,000. X may use $40,000 of its NOL carryforwards
as a deduction against its $100,000 net recognized built-in gain, because X's section 382 limitation is $40,000.







&sect;1.1374&hyph;6 



Credits and credit carryforwards.







(a) 



In general. 



The credits and credit carryforwards allowed as credits against the section 1374 tax under section 1374(b)(3) are
allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other credits or credit
carryforwards, such as foreign tax credits under section 901, are not allowed as credits against the section 1374
tax.
