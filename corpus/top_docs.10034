VOYAGER 2: IT'LL SPEND ETERNITY CRUISING SPACE 




By LEE SIEGEL, Associated Press 




In a billion years, when drifting continents have reshaped Earth's face and 
humans are extinct or changed by evolution, Voyager 2 will still be cruising 
the stars. 


"It's mind-boggling. We're actually going out to the stars," said Bruce Brymer, 
Voyager's lead mission controller at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. "This spacecraft is going to outlive us. It's going to be out there 
forever." 


In August, Voyager 2 swept past Neptune and its icy volcanic moon Triton -- the 
last planetary exploration in an incredible 12-year journey that also took the 
spacecraft past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and more than 50 moons. 




Interstellar Mission 


Now, Voyager 2 is speeding into the loneliest part of its trek: the Voyager 
Interstellar Mission. With Voyager 1, it will study the sun's magnetic field, 
solar wind and ultraviolet light from distant stars and galaxies. 


Like Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyager 1, which explored Jupiter and Saturn, 
Voyager 2 also will search for the edge of the solar system. 


The Voyagers are expected to return information to Earth until about 2015 or 
2020. Contact eventually will be cut off by some malfunction, by exhaustion of 
the probes' plutonium power generators, or when their thruster fuel runs out, 
leaving them unable to point antennas at Earth. 


Then, the robot explorers will pass among the stars, each carrying a 12-inch 
copper record of sounds and sights from Earth in case they are found by a 
spacefaring civilization. "Hopefully they will understand our peaceful and 
humble attempt at knowing and exploring the great unknown," Brymer said. 


For now, Voyager 2's work is more mundane. 


"The interstellar mission is sort of anticlimactic. There's no real drama 
expected. We're suffering from the blues a little bit," he said. "It's almost 
like postpartum depression. We've gone through such highs with the spacecraft. 
There's a great sense of melancholy now. It's like none I've sensed before." 


Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune officially ends Oct. 2, when it will be 34.7 
million miles past the planet, going 37,337 m.p.h. It will be 2.83 billion 
miles from Earth, and will have traveled 4.46 billion miles since 1977. 


Until December, Voyager 2 occasionally will glance at Neptune and dark space to 
improve the accuracy of observations its cameras and instruments made during 
the Neptune flyby, said Voyager project manager Norm Haynes. 


Pictures of empty space let engineers measure how much sunlight reflects off 
Voyager into its cameras. A computer can subtract the light from Voyager's 
Neptune and Triton photographs, producing clearer prints, Haynes said. 


In April, most of the planets will be positioned for one of the Voyagers to 
take photographs for assembly into a single picture of the solar system. "The 
planets are small and there's lots of dark space out there," he said. "Maybe it 
will give people a better impression of the vastness of things." 


Then engineers will turn off Voyager 2's TV cameras and its infrared and 
visible light sensors. 




Sensors Already at Work 


Voyager's Interstellar Mission officially starts Jan. 1, but the spacecraft 
already is using its remaining sensors to make the kind of measurements it will 
continue to collect for years. Ultraviolet light and cosmic ray sensors study 
distant galaxies and stars, and also black holes and pulsars -- remnants of 
stars that died in fiery supernova explosions. 


Both Voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields, electrically charged 
particles that make up solar wind, and waves in that wind. 


If the Voyagers and Pioneers survive, one or more of them may detect the 
"heliopause," where solar wind yields to interstellar wind 5 billion to 14 
billion miles from the sun. Many scientists consider it the edge of the solar 
system. 


By about 2020, the Voyagers will lose contact with Earth. 


"My electrical energy is fading, and I am feeling old and useless," says 
Voyager 2's imaginary voice in "The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide," a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration publication. "The planet which gave me 
life said goodby. I will no longer hear its voice, nor it my heartbeat." 


Then, Voyager will approach the stars, passing them like distant beacons in an 
incredible void. 


In the year 20391, Voyager will pass within 3.21 light years, 18.9 trillion 
miles, of Proxima Centauri, the nearest star. About 24,000 years from now, it 
should pass through the Oort Cloud, a vast spherical cloud of comets that other 
scientists consider the true edge of the solar system. 


"Then Voyager makes for the open sea of interstellar space, free of the sun's 
gravity and wandering forever in the Milky Way galaxy, going around the center 
of the galaxy once every quarter-billion years," said Cornell University 
astronomer Carl Sagan. 


NASA estimates that in the year 40176, Voyager 2 will fly 1.65 light years from 
Ross 248 -- the first time it will be closer to another star than to the sun, 
which will be 1.99 light years from Voyager. 




Near Sirius in Year 296036 


In the year 296036, Voyager 2 will make its closest approach to Sirius, the 
brightest star visible from Earth. 


Deep space is benign, so dust and cosmic rays will erode Voyager 2 
extraordinarily slowly. 


In a billion or more years, Sagan said, "there will be no more humans because 
we'll be extinct or we'll be somebody else. There will be no human artifacts 
left on Earth. Continental drift will completely change what the continents 
look like. 


"But this brave spacecraft will be there, a surviving artifact of our species 
and our times." 


Perhaps one day, aliens in a starship may find one of the Voyagers, then play 
the copper record. 


They will hear greetings in 60 languages from Chinese to Welsh to Urdu, 
including a 7-year-old boy offering salutations from Earth's children. 


There also is the music of many cultures, from Chuck Berry's rock 'n' roll to 
Mozart, Bach and Beethoven. 


The aliens will listen to the sounds of surf, wind, rain and thunder; croaking 
frogs and laughing hyenas; a train, a truck, a jet and a rocket; a baby crying 
and lovers kissing. 




Photographs, Diagrams 


The record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs or diagrams 
showing humans, the Earth and other planets, human chromosomes, a fetus, the 
Golden Gate, the Grand Tetons and the Great Wall of China. 


And the extraterrestrials will read a message written July 16, 1977, by Jimmy 
Carter, then President of a nation on a little planet that, two months later, 
dared to send a bit of itself to the stars: 


"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our 
science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. 


"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope 
someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic 
civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our 
good will in a vast and awesome universe."

LOCAL; 


2 MORE NEPTUNE MOONS DISCOVERED AS VOYAGER NEARS 8:56 P.M. FLYBY 




From Times wire services 




The Voyager 2 probe discovered two more moons around Neptune, pushing the 
ringed planet's total to eight as the probe raced toward its long-awaited 
late-night flyby of the "puzzling" blue planet, scientists said today. 


"This is it! This is the 24 hours we've been waiting for," Voyager project 
scientist Edward Stone said at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 


With Neptune filling the field of view in Voyager 2's cameras, a spectacular 
photograph was radioed back to Earth showing intricate detail of the Great Dark 
Spot, a titanic storm system topped by brilliant white cirrus clouds, a storm 
so large it could swallow the entire planet Earth. 


Astronomer Bradford Smith announced that two more moons were discovered, one 
measuring just 30 miles or so across and another with a diameter of about 55 
miles. The moons have been temporarily dubbed 1989 N5 and 1989 N6. 


If all goes well, Voyager 2 will streak 3,000 miles above Neptune's north polar 
cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. -- the closest the probe has been to a planet since 
launch from Earth 12 years and four days ago.

A PIECE OF US GOES ON A VOYAGE OF WONDER 




By TONY TAYLOR, Tony Taylor is a member of the technical staff guiding Voyager 
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 




Neptune. Almost 3 billion miles from Earth, it's a cold, impersonal place, a 
speck of a planet through even the largest telescope, but an enormous gas giant 
full of mysterious wonders when seen up close. 


In a little more than two weeks, we're going to experience it up close, you and 
I. We will see it through the eyes of a solar diplomat: a traveler, explorer, 
adventurer, and representative of the human race; a large metal-plastic-silicon 
representative named Voyager. 


When we arrive, what should we expect? The unexpected. That's the lesson 
learned from previous visits to unexplored planets. Are there rings at Neptune 
like those at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus? Possibly, but in incomplete arcs, 
unlike rings anywhere else. Are there other satellites, besides the known 
Triton and Nereid? Yes! Four others have already been discovered, and there's 
tantalizing evidence of more -- perhaps many more, maybe even clouds of them -- 
lurking just beneath the fuzz in the images painting the screens of video 
terminals at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In just days, now, they could rise 
to visibility above the electronic background noise. 


Neptune has its own internal heat source, and radiates more energy than it 
receives from the sun. Why? Is this what drives its turbulent atmosphere, 
generating the large spots already found? Soon, we may know. And Triton? We'll 
find whether it has an atmosphere, and whether we can see through to the 
surface. Will there be pools of liquid nitrogen, or will gases be frozen in 
slabs littering a desolate landscape of craters and mountains? Among the 
answers to the questions we know to ask will be the more questions we've not 
imagined -- again, the unexpected. 


When Voyager arrives at Neptune on Aug. 24 it will be the first time that 
anything human-made has been to that planet. We should appreciate and celebrate 
the event, since it will also likely be the last time it will happen during our 
lives. That's because an arrangement of the solar system that occurs only about 
every 175 years was required to allow Voyager to make the trip in "only" twelve 
years. 


It had to go by Jupiter first, making a hard left turn in that planet's gravity 
to pick up energy in a crack-the-whip fashion to go on to the next planet. That 
was Saturn, which turned it left again, gave it more energy and pointed it 
towards Uranus. At Uranus, in 1986, it picked up still more energy and made 
course for Neptune. Since then it has been cruising at 10 miles per second 
toward Neptune. At Neptune, it will skim over the north pole, 3,000 miles above 
the atmosphere, turn so that it's headed south out of the solar system and make 
a final encounter with Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, before beginning a 
larger interstellar voyage. 


The science at Neptune is important but think also about the voyage, the 
adventure. Knowledge is good for the human mind, but travel is food for the 
psyche. And Voyager's travels have been and will be prodigious. It has been on 
its way from Earth since 1977, wending a crooked path through the outer solar 
system. Now, in a handful of days, it makes its final rendezvous, a close brush 
and embrace with Neptune, before flying out of the solar system to begin an 
odyssey through the Milky Way galaxy; an unattended, lonely voyage that may 
last from millions to billions of years. 


Towards the beginning of that longer journey, a mere few hundred thousand years 
in the future, our sun will have become a faint, uninteresting star in 
Voyager's eternally night sky. But no one will be with the spacecraft to 
appreciate that fact, and our ambassador will be slowly tumbling -- sightless, 
senseless, and alone -- in an immensely empty void. 


A fellow engineer on our navigation team claims that the spacecraft will 
actually be on display in the Smithsonian Museums 200 years from now. He thinks 
that by then we'll have both the technology and wherewithal to go out, find and 
catch Voyager, and bring it back. I'd like to think we would be able to do 
that, but if I'm still around I'll vote to leave it alone. 


There's something wonderful about the thought that a piece of ourselves is 
somewhere out there on a winding journey between the stars on its way to 
eternity. It's like having immortal children. 


There are hazards ahead -- for example, unseen ring particles orbiting Neptune 
could smack into us, prematurely ending Voyager's life -- but we'll probably 
make it through to see the wonders of Neptune and Triton. Then will begin the 
grander voyage -- the one that requires us to be romantics instead of realists, 
dreamers rather than schemers: 


Even though Voyager will go blind and deaf after a few tens of years; even 
though it will die an electronic death, it will still have the germ of human 
creativity and daring incorporated into its very structure. 


It will carry two messages -- an explicit one in the form of a golden record, 
and an implicit one stated by its profoundly improbable existence. And both 
messages will say to the finder, in essence, "I am from the planet Earth. I am 
of the human race. We are small and insignificant, but our souls are large 
because we have set out on a journey to know the universe."

'HEROIC' VOYAGER, ITS HUMAN GUIDES 




I was thrilled to read about the accomplishments of Voyager II. What 
particularly struck me was how unique our planet is. There are no other planets 
in our solar system which can support and generate life as here on Earth. 
Therefore, it is even more evident how important it is that we manage and take 
care of the scarce resources on our planet by recycling, car pooling, taking 
shorter showers, and so on. The inconvenience of these actions seems small in 
view of the potential environmental obstacles we face at the time Voyager II 
crosses the heliopause and moves into the interstellar medium.

TANTALIZING TASTE OF THINGS TO COME; 


VOYAGER DISCOVERS MAGNETIC FIELD ON NEPTUNE 




By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 




For the first time, the spacecraft Voyager has detected intense radio signals 
coming from Neptune, revealing that the planet has a magnetic field and 
indicating that next week's close encounter will be as intriguing as scientists 
had hoped. 


The discovery suggests that the spacecraft will find a wide range of 
interesting phenomena as it passes close to the distant planet Thursday night, 
including the kind of auroral activity that produces the northern and southern 
lights on Earth. 


The signals were first detected last Monday, but scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory were not sure they were coming from Neptune, according to 
James Warwick, principal investigator on the planetary radio astronomy 
experiment. 




Not What Was Expected 


"Their character was different than what we were expecting," Warwick said. 


"The radio emissions are very intense," Warwick said, adding that they came in 
short, powerful bursts over a limited frequency range. Scientists had expected 
radio signals from Neptune, but they were looking for something less intense 
and less limited in frequencies. 


Warwick and fellow scientists working on the project decided to announce the 
discovery Friday after they grew more confident of what they were seeing. 


The discovery means Neptune has a strong magnetic field because radio waves are 
generated by charged particles that become trapped in the magnetic field and 
spiral into the planet's atmosphere. 


It is the same process that produces the northern lights on Earth. Charged 
particles from space flow along the Earth's magnetic field lines and into the 
atmosphere at either the North or South Pole, producing the celestial fireworks 
over the higher latitudes. Now, Voyager is expected to see the same thing at 
Neptune. 




Within 3,000 Miles 


The Voyager spacecraft, which will make its fourth and final planetary flyby 
next week when it passes within about 3,000 miles of Neptune's cloud tops, used 
a radio receiver and a giant pair of "rabbit ears" to detect the radio 
emissions -- just as it did at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Each 33-foot-long 
ear scans a series of frequencies and, since they work separately, the 
"polarization," or vibration, of the signals can be determined, thus 
distinguishing between radio signals generated by lightning and those created 
by a magnetic field. 


"We know we are dealing with a magnetic field," Warwick said. 


The discovery of a magnetic field also tells scientists something about the 
interior of Neptune. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of 
its molten iron core, and Neptune's strong magnetic field suggests that Neptune 
also has a region of fluid in its interior. 


Venus, Mars and probably Pluto do not have magnetic fields. 


Early analysis of the data from Voyager indicates that Neptune's magnetic field 
is similar in intensity to Earth's. 


As more and more data is collected on the magnetic field, scientists will be 
able to determine more precisely the length of a Neptunian day -- the time it 
takes for one rotation. That is believed to be about 18 hours, but by the time 
Voyager is through that figure should be known exactly. 


Until now, scientists have known little about Neptune other than such things as 
its atmospheric composition, which includes the methane that makes it appear 
blue. But Voyager will pass right over the planet's north pole, and that is 
fortuitous for scientists who are interested in its magnetic field. That 
trajectory will carry it through the intense field where charged particles are 
being funneled into the polar atmosphere, and that should reveal much about the 
field. 


In fact, by the time Voyager zips past Neptune it will have collected enough 
data for scientists to learn more about its magnetic field than any other 
planet except Earth.

MUSIC FOR A STELLAR GENERATION; 


SPACE: 'THE PLANETS' EXPRESSED AWE AND MYTHOLOGY; WHERE IS THE SYMPHONY TO 
ACCOMPANY US INTO THE FUTURE? 




By TONY TAYLOR, Tony Taylor is a member of the technical staff at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena that navigated Voyager through the solar 
system. 




Gustav Holst began writing "The Planets" in 1914. Its first performance, five 
years later, was a symphonic celebration of planets Mercury through Neptune 
(Pluto wasn't discovered until 1930). The music is beautiful and grand -- but 
something is lacking. Despite its variety, there is no human adventure. The 
planets, in those days, were still "gods" -- remote, aloof in a separate, 
self-contained universe, hermetically sealed from human interaction or 
contamination. The solar system was a very large and inaccessible place for 
mortals. 


Now another piece of music has played out; the last note of Voyager's Neptune 
encounter fades into the vacuum as the spacecraft departs our solar system, to 
be succeeded in the public mind by the discordance of the Bay Area earthquake 
and Eastern European upheavals. But we come not to bury Voyager; rather to 
praise. The brief encounter with Neptune was not an ending but a prelude to a 
larger quest and a longer symphony. 


After Voyager, the gods no longer reign. The planets belong to humankind. 


The outer planets and their satellites were but tiny, pretty baubles in our 
skies before Voyager's flight to Neptune and beyond. Now they are worlds in 
their own right, concrete and beautiful in their gargantuan presence. 


Gustav Holst was born too early. How was he to know the adventure of the 
planets and man's place among them? There was no way then to experience, even 
vicariously through the eyes of a Voyager, the pastoral solitude of 
interplanetary cruising; the rolling, thundering crescendo of planetary 
encounter. 


I imagine him looking over our shoulders, following Voyager across the sky. 
NASA's Goldstone antenna, a white leviathan in the center of an empty desert 
stage, glows in a fading twilight, hard bright stars overhead, the silence of 
the horizon dropping away into pink-gray distance. Why is it that this sight 
and silence seems so much like music? Gustav, are you listening? Can you hear 
the slow-motion turning against the sky? 


It's time for a new musical genius to bring us a modern symphony of adventure 
among the planets, of man's place among the gods. Let us hear the chaos of 
departure from Earth's surly bonds, the basso profundo of planetary encounter. 
It's time for that symphony, and I hope someone will write it, because it is 
the beginning of a story of human drama of Wagnerian proportion. It will help 
to tell us where we are and where we're going. 


And where is that? "To the supermarket," some will say. "My feet are firmly 
planted on Earth, and I'm going to work, I'm going home, I'm going to the 
hospital to visit a friend. I need to tend my garden." 


Worthy activities, but our children, or perhaps our grandchildren, are going to 
live in space. The urge to explore and expand is inborn. We are going, sooner 
or later, because we have no choice. Cast aside any debates about manned versus 
unmanned space exploration. They are irrelevant. 


As a species, we will begin by colonizing the solar system. We will break 
ourselves -- bodies and spirits -- on new shores, and we will regroup and 
plunge again, groping for dry land. Careers will be spent, lives lost in the 
quest. Music will help us mend, and drive us forward again. 


Many will not share our enthusiasm -- will not want to assume the hardships of 
pioneering. They are the equivalent of the Europeans who stayed behind, 
concerned with the problems of the Old World while explorers looked to the new. 


Let them be. Very few will be able to go, anyhow. We will need their help, a 
large home base for support while we explore and settle, until we are 
independent. And what will explorers do for our homeland, our mother Earth at 
that time? Probably the same thing that the United States of America did for 
England in 1776. Children have no responsibility to their parents; only to the 
children that follow. 


Voyager represents the beginning of a magic age. Its goodby to Neptune is our 
hello to the solar system. The journey will begin with small steps: footprints 
on Mars, new ones on the moon. Every step will be hard-fought, but eventually 
we will inhabit most of the solar neighborhood. At that point, we'll begin to 
get restless again -- we'll turn up our music and consider how to follow 
Voyager on a questing note, a trip to the stars.

NEPTUNE CAN BE AS CLOSE AS YOUR TV 




By STEVE WEINSTEIN 




Every once in a while, a clever screenwriter reminds us that when we peer up at 
some distant star or planet, we are actually looking into the past because the 
light thrown off by the celestial body takes so long to travel to us here on 
Earth. 


On public-television stations around the country tonight, would-be astronomers 
and insomniacs alike can spend the wee hours looking at close-up photographs of 
Neptune's recent past as Voyager 2 zips past the planet and its moons at 38,000 
m.p.h., snapping pictures like a shutter-happy tourist. 


Traveling at the speed of light, the signals that make up those photographs 
will take four hours and six minutes to traverse the 2.7 billion miles 
separating Neptune and Earth. And just as soon as the signals are received by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deep space tracking 
antennas in California, Spain and Australia and then turned into photographs by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, viewers will be able 
to see them on their television screens. 


The cosmic slide show begins at 11:30 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, at 11 p.m. on 
KVCR Channel 24 and at 12:25 a.m. on KPBS Channel 15, and will continue until 
at least 4 a.m. Friday. Anyone willing to stay up will get the first look at 
these pictures from deep space just hours after the 1-ton Voyager spacecraft 
makes its closest pass over the clouds of Neptune, turns 45 degrees with the 
help of the planet's gravity and then flies past Neptune's quirky moon, Triton. 
Voyager is scheduled to buzz within 3,000 miles of Neptune's wispy cloud tops 
tonight at 9. 


Reports on Voyager's close encounter with Neptune, the pale-blue eighth planet 
from the sun that was discovered in 1846, will also be carried throughout the 
night on Cable News Network and C-SPAN. CNN will have extended live coverage of 
the mission beginning at 1 a.m. 


During its 4.4-billion mile, circuitous journey through the solar system, 
Voyager 2 has already photographed Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Tonight's 
meeting with Neptune, which is four times the size of Earth, will be Voyager's 
final visit to a planetary system before it darts off into the infinity of 
space. Scientists hope that Voyager will provide the first direct measurements 
of the environment outside the solar system sometime in the next century. 


PBS' "Neptune All Night" will feature 20-minute updates each hour from NASA and 
JPL scientists as they examine and interpret the most recent photographs. The 
remaining 40 minutes each hour will originate live from WHYY-TV in Philadelphia 
and will include a panel of experts on the East Coast and at JPL analyzing the 
new data, live viewer calls on a nationwide toll-free hot line, reaction to the 
Neptune voyage from science-fiction writers and celebrities, a recap of 
Voyager's previous planetary encounters and a frivolous look at space travel in 
movies and science-fiction literature. 


"We are staying on the air all night to present this program because there 
really has been a rebirth in public interest in the space program," said Don 
Leifer, program director at KVCR in San Bernardino. "We literally had a block 
party on my street with all the people watching the lunar eclipse (last week). 
This show is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. It's the first time anyone 
will have seen such close-up pictures of Neptune, and we felt this falls 
exactly into where public television should go." 


Earlier this week, Edward Stone, Voyager's chief project scientist, called the 
meeting with Neptune "the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer 
planets, and like a symphony, its tempo is accelerating as it nears the end." 


Already Voyager has discovered four previously unknown Neptunian moons, a 
complete ring and several partial rings circling the planet, a huge storm 
system the size of the Earth that may pack winds up to 400 m.p.h. and a strong 
magnetic field. JPL scientists expect further discoveries today as the 
spacecraft sails through the upper reaches of Neptune's atmosphere and then 
within 2,500 miles of Triton, the moon that revolves the "wrong" way and 
appears to have a transparent atmosphere and a pinkish, iced surface. 


"It may snow from time to time in places, there may be heavy frost laid down," 
astronomer Bradford Smith said of the eccentric satellite. "What we would 
really like to do is to get some idea of what Triton's geological history has 
been. It's a strange satellite, it's in the wrong orbit, it's going backward 
around Neptune, and something truly catastrophic must have happened at some 
time in its past." 


Voyager's snapshots of Neptune can also be seen on the NASA-Select satellite 
feed by anyone with their own satellite dish, on some cable-access channels and 
at various locations around the Southland. The NASA-Select feed will contain 
fresh images from space as well as NASA and JPL press conferences and 
discussions of the mission and the spacecraft's discoveries. The NASA feed will 
begin at 9 a.m. today and continue through the night, and also will be 
broadcast from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day through Tuesday. 


The NASA-Select feed can be seen at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, the Griffith Park Observatory, Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in San 
Diego, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Cal State Long Beach, El 
Camino College, San Diego State, Santa Monica College, UCLA, USC, Ambassador 
College, Southwestern College and on some cable systems. Interested viewers 
should call their cable operators for details. 


The Learning Channel will also offer a one-hour progress report on Voyager 
today at 5 p.m. CNN will air a special report, "Voyager: Rendezvous With 
Neptune," Saturday at 5 a.m. And TBS will carry its own special on Voyager at 7 
p.m. Sunday, hosted by Carl Sagan and Sidney Poitier.

VOYAGER 2 AIMS TO END TOUR IN GRAND FASHION 




By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 




The Grand Tour is almost over. 


The venerable Voyager 2 spacecraft is sailing through the back yard of the 
solar system at more than 42,000 m.p.h., closing in on the last encounter of 
the most incredible journey of all. 


The automated craft is plunging through an area nearly 3 billion miles away 
where no visitor from Earth has ever been before, aiming toward a spectacular 
flight over the cloud tops of Neptune at 9 p.m. on Aug. 24. No one has ever 
seen Neptune other than as a ball of telescopic fuzz, but by the time Voyager 
is through, thousands of close-up photos and warehouses full of data will have 
been sent back to Earth. 


Scientists will watch the encounter with rapture, knowing that nothing like 
this will happen again for decades, perhaps even centuries. 


For many years they will study the images and examine the data and rewrite the 
textbooks as Voyager 2 soars out into the Milky Way to wander among the stars, 
possibly forever. Its twin, Voyager 1, is already on its way to study emissions 
from distant stars, its journey to the planets completed. 


For most people, the fantastic flight of the Voyagers will end later this month 
when Voyager 2 whips past Neptune and pays a quick visit to its extraordinary 
moon, Triton. The spacecraft has already discovered four new moons, including 
three announced Thursday. 


But the electronic camera that has allowed armchair scientists to tour the 
solar system's four outer planets will soon grow quiet, ending a 12-year 
odyssey that is without parallel. 


"The picture show will be over," said Edward C. Stone, vice president of 
Caltech and chief scientist on the Voyager project. 




Fitting End 


The Neptune encounter should be spectacular, and many of those final pictures 
will be shown live on television, providing a fitting end for a most unusual 
spacecraft. The one-ton Voyager is the most sophisticated robot ever built, 
composed of 65,000 parts, including an on-board computer that has the 
electronic circuitry equivalent to 2,000 color TV sets. In recent years, 
Voyager 2 has been electronically rebuilt by controllers at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena as it sailed through the solar system, making 
photography possible under circumstances comparable to taking pictures in a 
dark cellar. 


The craft's computer is sophisticated enough for the Voyager to heal itself 
when trouble arises. It can even shut off important electronic parts during 
times of radiation peril, or freeze its orientation toward Earth if for some 
reason it appears in danger of drifting into a position where contact with 
Mission Control would be lost. 


Stone expects the two Voyagers to send scientific data on the composition of 
interstellar space back to Earth for another quarter of a century, but there 
will be no more Neptunes, no more moons like Jupiter's Io with its potent 
volcanoes, no more mad dashes through the rings of Saturn. It will be the 
middle of the 22nd Century before the outer planets once again present 
themselves in such an alignment that would make a similar mission possible. 


Neptune will grow ever dimmer as Voyager 2 dips below the ecliptic plane in 
which the planets travel around the sun, signaling the end of an era. 




A Sad Day 


"I'm going to be sad," admitted Charles E. Kohlhase, who for the last 14 years 
has worried about every detail of the mission. As manager of the Voyager 
mission planning office at JPL, Kohlhase well remembers the early days when he 
and his colleagues wondered among themselves: "Is this really going to work?" 


Yet work it did, "better than any of us expected," Stone observed. 


The magnitude of that fact was underscored by astronomer Carl Sagan, a member 
of the Voyager's imaging team, during a recent speech to JPL employees. 


"This will surely be in the history books 1,000 years from now," Sagan said. 


"Voyager is a unique event in solar system exploration," he added. "But an era 
is drawing to an end." 


The climax is not without peril, however. Even a small piece of dust could 
severely damage Voyager during its daringly close flyby. 




Antenna Network 


Throughout the encounter with Neptune, 38 different antennas on four continents 
will be used to receive transmissions from Voyager. Many of them have been 
enlarged, and some have been tied together to form a network of antennas to 
monitor the weak signal. 


The total cost of both Voyager missions is about $865 million, according to 
Kohlhase. 


That means the Grand Tour, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
likes to call it, has cost every American 20 cents per year, he added. And in 
12 short years it has produced more information about the solar system than had 
been learned throughout history. 


Although this month will bring the end of the planetary odyssey, Voyager will 
go out in spectacular form. Consider this: 


* Neptune is 2.71 billion miles away, so far that Voyager will be on its own 
throughout the close encounter. It will take four hours and six minutes for 
Voyager's radio transmissions, traveling at 186,000 miles per second, to reach 
Earth. That means that if an object should suddenly loom in Voyager's path as 
it zips past Neptune at 17 miles per second, the spacecraft would have hit it 
hours before ground controllers even learn of the danger. There will be no 
opportunity to correct its course from Earth. 


* Voyager is so distant that by the time its radio signal reaches Earth it will 
be reduced to the strength of only one ten-quadrillionth of a watt. That is 20 
billion times weaker than the power used to operate a digital wristwatch. 


* The amount of sunlight that reaches Neptune is about 1,000 times less than 
that reaching Earth, making it extremely difficult to capture clear images. So 
engineers have come up with a system that will allow the entire spacecraft to 
"nod" so that its camera can remain fixed on the target as the craft speeds 
past, permitting longer exposures. Each electronic image will be composed of 
more than 5 million bits of data, so as the craft whips past Neptune it will 
create a continuous string of data nearly 3 billion miles long, reaching back 
to Earth. 


* Voyager will pass within 3,000 miles of Neptune's north pole, closer than it 
has come to any other object in the solar system. That is, quite literally, 
right over the cloud tops. 


* Neptune's gravitational pull at that close range will change Voyager's course 
by 90 degrees, sending it off to encounter one of the strangest objects in the 
solar system five hours later. Voyager is to pass 24,000 miles from the surface 
of Triton, which is about the size of Earth's moon but a very different body 
indeed. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that travels 
backwards, orbiting Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. 
Scientists think they know why, and Voyager should tell them if they are right. 


* By the time Voyager passes Neptune, 11,000 man years will have been devoted 
to the mission, according to JPL's Kohlhase. 


The Voyager program was initially funded to study only the planets Jupiter and 
Saturn. Two spacecraft were provided so that if one failed, the other could 
complete the mission. 


Voyager 2 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Titan-Centaur 
rocket on Aug. 20, 1977. Sixteen days later Voyager 1 was launched on a shorter 
trajectory, so the second spacecraft arrived at the two planets first, reaching 
Jupiter on March 5, 1979, and Saturn on Nov. 12, 1980. 




Voyager 1 Pays Price 


Voyager 1 passed close to the two planets while Voyager 2 remained at a safer 
distance. Both encounters by both spacecraft were an enormous success, but 
Voyager 1 paid a price -- it passed through an intense radiation belt 
surrounding Jupiter, and several instruments aboard the craft were severely 
damaged. 


"If you had been riding the spacecraft you would have received a lethal dose of 
radiation," Kohlhase said. In fact, he added, the amount of radiation would 
have been 1,000 times greater than humans can endure. 


So a somewhat crippled Voyager 1 was allowed to end its planetary sojourn and 
zip on out toward the stars. But Voyager 2 was still in excellent condition, 
just as it is all these years later, and mission planners at JPL did not want 
to let go. 


NASA agreed to provide funding for the rest of the Grand Tour, and Voyager 2 
used the gravitational field of Saturn to fling itself out toward Uranus. 




Date With Miranda 


On Jan. 24, 1986, Voyager 2 zipped passed Uranus, but the planet itself ended 
up being upstaged by one of its moons, Miranda. Miranda, it turned out, had 
strange contours on its surface that to this day have not been fully explained. 


Like Uranus, Neptune may well end up playing second fiddle. The planet will 
appear bluish in color because of the methane in its atmosphere, and it will 
have more atmospheric texture than Uranus. But since it is essentially a huge 
ball of hydrogen and helium gas, there are no surface features to observe other 
than clouds. There will never be a "landing" on Neptune, because there is no 
land. 


But Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is another story entirely and it has 
fascinated scientists ever since it was discovered in 1846 -- just one month 
after Neptune itself was detected. A smaller moon, Nereid, was discovered in 
1949, and Voyager has since found four more. That, however, is not very many 
moons compared to the other great planets, and that shortage has long troubled 
scientists because they can see no reason why Neptune should have so few. 




Wrong-Way Moon 


Once every 5.88 days, Triton completes an orbit around Neptune, but it travels 
in the wrong direction. Moons form in the equatorial plane around planets, and 
in all other cases they move in the direction of the planet's rotation. 


"When planets form they have a disk and small satellites, and small satellites 
orbit in the same direction as the planet," said Stone, who has been the 
Voyager's chief scientist throughout the mission. 


Why is Triton traveling in the opposite direction in a cockeyed orbit that 
carries it far above and below the planet's equator? 


A team of Caltech scientists led by astrophysicist Peter Goldreich have argued 
that Triton is not a natural part of the Neptunian system at all and that the 
reddish-brown moon was actually a chunk of rock and ice wandering through the 
solar system that collided with one of Neptune's moons. That spectacular 
collision would have destroyed the other satellite and sent Triton careening 
off on a very irregular orbit, so the argument goes. 


If Triton was a wandering "planetesimal" that collided with a Neptunian 
satellite, it would have entered a highly elliptical orbit, passing as close as 
five Neptune radii from the planet and then moving out to more than 100 radii 
in an elongated orbit. 




Sweeping a Path 


That irregular orbit would have caused Triton to sweep through those altitudes, 
smashing into any other moons that happened to be in the area. 


"Triton would have devoured the regular satellite system, other than those that 
are closer than about five radii," Goldreich said. 


Eventually, Triton's orbit would grow circular, but not before "almost any 
object in its path would have been destroyed," he added. 


During that period, which probably lasted up to a billion years, Triton would 
have been subjected to immense stresses due to the changes in Neptune's 
gravitational pull as the moon plunged close to the planet, and then zipped 
far, far away. The stresses, called "tidal forces," would have been great 
enough to liquefy the core of the satellite, and possibly its surface. 


Voyager should reveal whether this theory is true, according to both Stone and 
Goldreich. Furthermore, anyone who follows Voyager's discoveries during August 
will have a chance to test the theory for themselves. 




Test of Theory 


If that scenario is correct, Voyager should not find new moons between five and 
100 radii of Neptune. The four that have been discovered so far are in orbits 
close to the planet and would not have been affected by Triton's grand sweep. 


It would be an immense problem for the theory if Voyager discovered a lot of 
moons in the area that Triton should have swept clear, but at this point that 
appears improbable. 


Moreover, if Triton was liquefied during the time when it would have been 
sweeping up other moons, there should be far fewer craters on its surface than 
on other moons throughout the solar system. Thus the surface of Triton should 
be reasonably smooth, although some cratering could have occurred after the 
surface hardened. 


If the surface of Triton is indeed much smoother than the surface of the 
Earth's moon, and if a spate of new moons are not discovered beyond five radii, 
chalk one up for the theorists and think of Triton as a captured wanderer. 


But if Triton is heavily cratered and many other moons are discovered circling 
Neptune, scratch Goldreich, et al., and look for another explanation for 
Triton's peculiarities. That, however, is considered unlikely. 




More Than a Rock 


No matter who is right, Voyager's view of Triton should be sensational. 
Evidence suggests that Triton has pools of frozen nitrogen on its surface, so 
this should not be just a dull hunk of rock orbiting a distant planet. 


First, however, Voyager has to get there and, despite its success record over 
the last 12 years, the rest of the journey is not without hazards. Scientists 
believe there should be little debris in Voyager's path. But no one can be 
absolutely certain of that. 


"We are barreling in there really close," said JPL's Kohlhase. "We think we are 
outside the rings, and above the atmosphere. But are we going to make it? Are 
we running out of good fortune?" 


Only Voyager knows for sure.

   By PAUL GRIFFITHS


The Voyage, Philip Glass's new opera to celebrate the Columbus qincentenary,
is a great big thing, but deeply uncertain, and uncertain most of all about
itself. The work is at least true to the mood of the celebration of a
momentous historical event which could not decide whether to remember it in
celebration or in shame.
Glass is reported as saying, with engaging candour, that he and his
librettist David Henry Hwang had to find something about Columbus that they
liked. Their ruthless solution was to cut the navigator's appearance to two
scenes, in both of which he could be portrayed alone, mapless and troubled:
at sea in the main part of the second act, and then on his deathbed at the
end of the third. Elsewhere they replaced him with heroes nearer the modern
heart's desire; a wheelchair-bound cosmologist in the prologue (hauling
Stephen Hawking into the picture is a offensive piece of opportunism), and,
for the whole first act and much of the third, a space-ship commander who is
female. The discovery (out-word) of the New World is thus defused of all
problems as it goes into the gravity-less domain of space fantasy.
The authors' excuse would seem to be that The Voyage is not really about
Columbus at all, but about the meeting of cultures (ostensibly the subject
of Hwang's play M. Butterfly) and about the restlessness of the human
spirit. Hence their decision to rendezvous with that meeting and that
restlessness in diverse dramatic situations: in the figure of Columbus, in
the mental excursions of the contemporary scientist, in the arrival on earth
of extra-terrestrials 15,000 years ago, and in the embarkation on a new,
celestial voyage into the unknown a hundred years from now, the lady
commander belonging both to the prehistoric past and to the future.
But one has to wonder whether The Voyage is properly about any of this at
all, whether the enacted scenes are not just images suitable for stage
spectacle to be going on while the music idles through vast tracts of time.
It is, most particularly, odd that a piece with this title, and with this
supposed subject matter, should undertake so little of a voyage within
itself. The score begins in E minorish rotations, and there it still is at
the end, three and a half hours later. Glass's music is now quicker in
movement, more rhythmically supple and more chromatic than it was, say, in
Einstein on the Beach, but this is not all to the good: because the
framework is still, rhythmically and tonally, in unyielding stasis and
repetition, the odd wandering detail easily sounds unmotivated and makes no
difference to the rock-like immobility. This is music that is not going
anywhere - Glass's only formal device is exchange of one texture for
another. This is music, too, whatever the scientist may sing in his words,
that makes no attempt to reach for the stars.
The opera cheers up a bit in the last act, after it has given up any claim
or wish to make sense (the long scene of Columbus's dark night of the soul
in the second act, over a shifting, revolving bass like that of Pimen's
soliloquy in Boris, was perhaps for Glass too a rite de passage). This third
act begins with a silly scene for 'Space Twins' and 'Earth Twins', the
latter accompanied by a hunchbacked bass line suggesting the Niebelung of
Das Rheingold and Siegfried. Later there is a chorus in which 21st-century
dignitaries - 'Prime Minister of the EEC', 'Executive Vice President of Coca
Cola' - are absurdly saluted. Then the commander and her three fellow crew
members lift off (luckily most of their words are inaudible), and there
remains only the inevitable after-thought of the dying luckless Columbus.
David Pountney, directing his first Met production, comes into his own when
the piece starts to go haywire, bringing on the dancing girls and a
characteristic vulgar comic energy. Otherwise the visual display is largely
a matter of dimwitted choreography and design, the latter disappointing for
the rumoured cost of Dollars 1 1/2 m: Robert Israel (sets) and Dunya
Ramicova (costumes) have done much finer work, on much smaller budgets, for
Peter Sellars. Bruce Ferden, the conductor, is creditably - and
astonishingly - enthused and disciplined. The cast (and this is probably in
the nature of the piece) is led not so much by Timothy Noble's gruff
Columbus as by Patricia Schuman's ringing, imperious Commander, with Kaaren
Erickson, Douglas Perry and Julien Robbins all excellent as her crew.
Tatiana Troyanos makes two fearsome appearances as Isabella, the
15th-century voyager's stentorian and, as it turns out, so misleading muse.

.. . WISH YOU WERE HERE 




It is an epochal chapter in the long history of human exploration. 


At 9 p.m. on the night of Aug. 24, the spacecraft Voyager 2 will pass within 
3,000 miles of the planet Neptune's cloud-enshrouded north pole. At that 
moment, 12 years and 4 days into its historic flight, nearly 3 billion miles 
from its home, the craft will again share with the men who sent it the sights 
no one has ever seen. 


Voyager, the most sophisticated robot ever built, consists of 65,000 different 
parts and a computer so sophisticated that it can heal itself when damage 
threatens its mission. But on that day of man's first encounter with the most 
distant of the outer solar system's great planets, the craft will be so far 
from Earth that, even though they travel at the speed of light, its 
photographic transmissions home will take 4 hours and 6 minutes to reach the 
network of 38 antennas on four continents arrayed to receive them. 


Voyager is the greatest in a series of unmanned space probes whose 
accomplishments are unique in the annals of man's exploration of his physical 
universe. Their journeys over almost unimaginable distances are adventures of 
the human mind, but not of the human body. Theirs are the feats of daring 
intellects and dazzling ingenuity, and not of the body's courage or endurance, 
as all such stories of exploration in far places have been before. 


In the face of their monumental achievement, man -- the creator left behind -- 
also is left to wonder what exactly this new experience is? Is he the prime 
mover or merely the spectator to the machines' first great adventure? 


Those of a romantic bent might argue that while Voyager has stored up 
scientific treasure, it has done little to enrich the human spirit -- that the 
project's triumphal elevation of the machine has degraded mankind from an 
explorer to a consumer of exploration. That, we think, is a narrow, even 
vulgar, view, one that reduces adventure to mere sensation and exploration to a 
kind of trial by combat. 


Voyager, in all its magnificent accomplishment, is but the latest reminder of 
the fact that in all things that really matter, what man's mind can grasp far 
exceeds the reach of his frail body.

SMEARED PHOTO HELPS SCIENTISTS; 


ICY BOULDERS GIVE CLUE TO ODD NEPTUNE RING 




By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 




Scientists studying photographs relayed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft have 
discovered huge icy boulders in a mysterious ring around Neptune, possibly 
providing a clue as to why the planet's outermost ring is so bizarre. 


The icy "moonlets" measure up to about 10 miles in diameter, far larger than 
the dust-like particles believed to make up the rest of the ring. 


More importantly, they were found in an area that is much brighter and wider 
than the rest of the ring. Ground-based astronomers discovered that segment of 
the ring several years ago and concluded erroneously that they had found only 
partial rings, called ring arcs. 




Clue in Photograph 


No one could explain then why any planet would have ring arcs because 
scientists could see no reason why ring particles would not be distributed 
fairly uniformly around the entire planet. 


Voyager scientists determined last week that Neptune's rings are complete, 
although the segments discovered by astronomers earlier were lumpy and highly 
irregular. That too has eluded explanation. 


That changed Saturday when scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
announced that a smeared photograph may provide the answer. For the Voyager, 
even when something goes wrong it seems to turn out right. 


A smeared photograph is the nemesis of any shutterbug, but one sent back by the 
intrepid 12-year-old robot caught the interest of the scientists, said Bradford 
Smith of the University of Arizona, leader of the Voyager's imaging team. 


Smith said that when scientists looked at the image, they detected about six or 
eight bright spots that had been moving along the ring during the exposure and 
thus appeared as long lines. Camera movement, which smeared the image, also 
caused the lines to twist, resulting in what appeared to be a braided ring. 


The "braids" were in fact just bright spots that had to be clumps of matter 
large enough to show up as streaks, just like a distant star that also appeared 
in the image, Smith said. 


That told the scientists that the ring contained "some embedded rocks," Smith 
said. 


The "rocks," which he said probably contain a lot of ice and might best be 
described as "moonlets," dominate the fatter segments of the ring. The narrow 
band of smaller particles extending the rest of the way around Neptune was 
discovered just before Voyager's closest approach last Thursday night. 


"We've been looking to see if there's something that is different about this 
particular ring" that could explain why it is so inconsistent, Smith said. 
"This may be it." 




More Than Two Rings 


Voyager data also revealed Saturday that Neptune is more than just a two-ring 
circus. Voyager images now show that the distant planet has up to five rings. 


Smith said the most recently discovered rings are so broad that their small 
particles are spread so thin they can just barely be seen, and all lie closer 
to the planet than the outermost ring that was confirmed last week. 


The broadest of the rings is many hundreds of miles in width and lies closest 
to Neptune, he added. 


The discovery of the moonlets was only one of many developments Saturday at 
JPL, where scientists continue to revel in the immense amount of data that 
Voyager sent back to Earth in its grand finale as the unchallenged leader among 
planetary explorers. 




Gravity Slows Voyager 


The Voyager is now nearly a million and a half miles beyond Neptune, speeding 
toward space at nearly 38,000 m.p.h. Its speed is less now because it is 
fighting Neptune's gravity instead of being pulled by it as it heads off toward 
its first encounter with another star. 


It is due to pass within about 25 trillion miles of Bernard's Star in the year 
8571. 


Meanwhile, JPL scientists were entering the home stretch Saturday, comparing 
notes as they prepared to wrap up the "close phase" of the Neptune encounter 
this Tuesday. 


There are 11 scientific teams on the Voyager project, each concentrating on 
different disciplines ranging from the study of the "interplanetary medium" to 
the composition of Neptune's backward traveling moon, Triton. 


The planetary encounter provides a unique opportunity for experts in one field 
to compare their results with findings by colleagues in other disciplines. That 
cross-fertilization makes it possible for experts to engage in instant 
analysis, although not always with a great deal of confidence. 


For example, geologists on the imaging team were fascinated by features on the 
surface of Triton that appeared to have been shaped by winds, just as sand 
dunes in the desert are molded by the wind on Earth. 


For that to work, however, Triton would need a fairly dense atmosphere, and the 
geologists asked the project's atmospheric scientists if their data showed that 
Triton's atmosphere could be heavy enough. 


"We need (a dense atmosphere)," Smith said, "but they won't give it to us." 




Nitrogen in Atmosphere 


So if some of the features on Triton's surface were in fact shaped by the wind, 
it must have been at some other time, in some other season, when the conditions 
on the moon's surface were different than they are today. 


Scientists have also determined that Triton's atmosphere has one of the 
components of Southern California's smog, nitrogen. 


That discovery also required the assistance of a distant star. 


Bill Sandel of the University of Arizona said it had not been possible for 
astronomers on Earth to determine all the constituents of Triton's atmosphere 
because they cannot separate the moon from its atmosphere when viewed from the 
Earth. So researchers have debated among themselves over the nature of Triton's 
atmosphere. 


"This has been a controversy that has been with us for years," Sandel said. 


An ultraviolet spectrometer aboard the Voyager solved that problem by studying 
the light from a star as it was eclipsed by first the atmosphere and then the 
icy surface of Triton. Since different light frequencies are absorbed by 
different elements, the spectrometer could define the atmosphere's composition 
by detecting which frequencies were absorbed. 


Data from that experiment shows that nitrogen dominates Triton's atmosphere, 
although there is some methane (natural gas) close to the surface. 


Scientists also reported Saturday that Neptune's magnetic field is inclined at 
least 30 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation. On most planets, including 
Earth, the inclination is about 10 degrees, so Neptune's is odd but not as odd 
as Uranus', which is inclined 60 degrees. 




'Humble' Magnetosphere 


The magnetic field also creates an envelope around the planet, called the 
magnetosphere, which plays an important role in such things as the auroral 
activity that creates the northern and southern lights on Earth. 


Physicist Tom Krimigis of Johns Hopkins University reported Saturday that 
"Neptune's magnetosphere is rather humble." 


That may be one reason Voyager scientists have not found conclusive evidence 
that the spacecraft detected northern lights when it passed within 3,000 miles 
of the clouds over Neptune's north pole.

METEORS, ECLIPSE WILL BE STARS OF SKY SHOW 




By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 




There will be something for everybody in the nighttime sky during the next few 
weeks, including a meteor shower this weekend and a total eclipse of the moon 
next week. 


August will also bring the astronomical highlight of the year when the aging 
Voyager 2 spacecraft zips over the cloud tops of Neptune on the evening of Aug. 
24. Even the most powerful telescopes on Earth will not be able to see the 
one-ton spacecraft as it visits the fourth and final planet on its "Grand Tour" 
of the outer solar system, but Voyager will beam back thousands of images and a 
warehouse full of scientific data to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 


Also out of sight will be another, less spectacular event involving the 
smallest planet in the solar system. Pluto will prove that not only is it a bit 
puny, it is also a little tricky. 




Fickle Orbit 


On Sept. 5, Pluto will make its closest approach to the sun, called perihelion. 
The tiny planet will still be a long way away, about 2.7 billion miles to be 
exact, but the event will prove once again that Pluto can be a bit fickle. That 
is because the highly elliptical orbit that Pluto follows brings it inside the 
orbit of Neptune for perihelion, making it the eighth planet from the sun, not 
the ninth. 


Neptune, which is awaiting the encounter with Voyager, is currently the most 
distant known planet in the solar system, and it will stay that way for several 
years until Pluto once again moves outside its orbit. Anyone who misses Pluto's 
approach to the sun this time can catch it again in the year 2236. 


While only those equipped with a very powerful telescope will be able to watch 
Pluto's lonely voyage, everyone will have a chance to take part in the Perseids 
meteor shower Friday night and early Saturday morning. 


There are at least 10 significant meteor showers each year, and the Perseids is 
the most prolific. It occurs each August when the Earth passes through the 
debris left behind by a comet known as Swift-Tuttle. The shower has been 
observed for 1,900 years, and in some years up to 100 meteors per hour have 
been seen entering the Earth's atmosphere. 


For years the Perseids were known as "the Tears of St. Lawrence" after a 
Spanish martyr who was killed close to the time of the shower in the year 258. 


The meteors enter the Earth's atmosphere at about 135,000 m.p.h., incinerating 
themselves as they plunge through the air. 


Andrew Fraknoi, executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 
said observers should be able to see about 50 meteors per hour if they find an 
area removed somewhat from city lights so they have a clear view of the dark 
sky. He also recommends against using binoculars because any such instrument 
will narrow the field of view. 


All that is necessary, he said, is to find a dark spot, let your eyes adjust to 
the darkness for about 15 minutes, and then lie back and enjoy the show. 


The total lunar eclipse will occur next Wednesday, Aug. 16, when the Earth 
passes directly between the sun and the moon, capturing the moon in its shadow. 


Those watching the event in California will have a slight problem in that the 
eclipse actually begins at 7:28 p.m., a few minutes before the sun sets so it 
will be hard to see it in the early minutes. However, the total eclipse will 
last until 8:56 p.m., so it will be dark long before the show ends. 


As the eclipse ends, the moon will become more and more visible as it emerges 
from behind the Earth and into sunlight. 


Shutterbugs should have no trouble capturing the event on film, weather 
permitting. Dennis Mammana, resident astronomer at the Reuben H. Fleet Science 
Center in San Diego noted that exposure settings for "shooting the moon" are 
the same as for any other object in full sunlight. 




No Threat to Eyes 


Unlike an eclipse of the sun, a lunar eclipse poses no threat to the eyes of 
observers on Earth. 


There is yet another possibility in this smorgasbord of astronomical delights. 
The Space Shuttle Columbia was launched Tuesday on a secret military mission, 
reportedly carrying a spy satellite. 


Normally, the shuttle follows an orbit that keeps it well south of California, 
but if the reports of its cargo are correct, it should have been launched into 
an orbit that will carry it to more than 50 degrees above the Equator. That 
would bring it over California repeatedly until it ends its five-day mission at 
Edwards Air Force Base. 


This being a secret mission, there is no way of knowing when the shuttle will 
pass over California, but anyone who sees a faint light rising in the east and 
zipping to the western horizon in about three minutes should be advised that 
was no meteor.

VOYAGER BEAMS BACK PROOF OF NEPTUNE, TRITON AURORAS 




From Times Wire Services 




Voyager 2 data confirm the existence of flickering auroral displays in the 
atmospheres of the ringed planet Neptune and its baffling volcanic moon Triton 
-- the coldest world ever studied, scientists announced today. 


University of Arizona researcher Roger Yelle told a news conference that 
analysis of data beamed back earlier in the Voyager 2 Neptune encounter 
indicates the temperature of Triton's lower atmosphere is 400 degrees below 
zero. 


"The temperature of the atmosphere is 37 degrees (above absolute zero), which 
is equivalent to 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero," he said. "Simply put, 
Triton appears to be the coldest object in the solar system that we've visited 
so far." 


He said both Triton and Neptune have auroras -- the flickering displays 
produced by the interaction of electrically charged particles and a planet's 
magnetic field -- although the phenomenon on Neptune is complex and difficult 
to understand. 


The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor revealed auroras 
-- somewhat like Earth's northern and southern lights -- in several places in 
Neptune's skies and over much of the day side of Triton, Yelle said. 


The auroras occur at odd places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, 
which is a steep 50 degrees from the planet's rotation axis, Yelle said. 


Voyager 2 is now cruising away from the solar system on an endless space 
odyssey. Scientists are discussing the possibility of using the spacecraft's 
cameras to take a wide-angle shot of the whole solar system at some point in a 
first-of-a-kind portrait of humanity's home in the cosmos.

WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by
their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years
ago?
This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for
decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and
travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar
to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed
the 6,000 mile voyage to America.
The idea that the ancient Chinese exported some of their developed culture
to the Americas is strongly supported by Professor Joseph Needham, the
eminent orientalist and historian.
Modern archaeological techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, have
established that the first real 'discoverers' of the continent, were Stone
Age hunter-gatherers from Asia who crossed the Bering Strait around 12,000
to 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, when sea-levels were
much lower than today.
These then dispersed throughout North and South America. As the world's
climate warmed and sea levels rose, contact was broken. There the agreement
on the cultural evolution of the AmerIndians ends.
Academic debate now centres around two antagonistic groups. The first,
dubbed the 'transoceanic culture diffusionists', claims that the many
similarities that have been observed between Asiatic and AmerIndian cultures
are the result of subsequent maritime contact between the two continents.
The second group, which believes in 'independent development' claims that
the similarities are coincidental, and the culture, science and technology
of the Americas developed independently . These achievements include the
highly accurate Mayan calendar and their pictographic scripts, impressive
stone temples demonstrating sophisticated geometric and engineering skills,
the cultivation of maize and cotton, and ornate metalworking of gold and
silver.
Severin's 'China Voyage' as it is to be called, will challenge the
'independent developmentalists' viewpoint. His voyage across the Pacific
ocean from Hong Kong to Mexico, will be aboard a specially built 60-foot
bamboo raft which is a replica of the sailing craft used by Chinese
fishermen and mariners 2000 years ago.
Taking the east-going Kuroshio current across the north Pacific, which was
used by the Spanish galleons in the 16th century, his aim is to follow the
probable route of an expedition of 3,000 Asian mariners of the Ch'in dynasty
in 218 BC, who are recorded as having been despatched by their emperor to
find a land across the ocean. There they believed a drug which would give
long life could be found. Severin believes they may have succeeded although
they never returned.
Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a
leather-hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course
of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica
ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the
Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China
Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks - one following
a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan.
The raft for the China Voyage has been designed by Colin Mudie, who worked
on three other replica craft for Severin's previous expeditions. It is being
built at Sam S'on on the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam, the only place in the
world says Severin, where such vessels are still in use.
A precursor of the later Chinese junks, the raft consists of three layers of
bamboo lashed together with rattan string and bamboo skin. Two small cabins,
which will be 'home' to the five-man crew for the six-month voyage, are made
of plaited bamboo strips sealed with a mixture of sawdust and tree lacquer.
It is powered by three Chinese battened lugsails set on bamboo masts and
steered by an arrangement of rudders and centreboards. When fully-laden, the
deck will be only a foot above sea-level.
The crafts's seaworthiness is based on a 'wash-through' principle, allowing
it to absorb the power of heavy seas by letting waves percolate through the
fabric of the hull. Severin says that prolonged exposure to the elements
will be a major problem for the five-man crew. Other perils they may have to
face are fog and typhoons. He said 'previous attempts to reconstruct voyages
in bamboo rafts have never gone so far without sinking, breaking up or being
eaten up by shipworm'.
However, Severin is no stranger to hardship. He braved storms, killer whales
and pack ice in the north Atlantic in a small leather-hulled curragh during
the Brendan voyage. He was surrounded by sharks and becalmed in the Doldrums
on his Sinbad voyage.
The China Voyage will have the benefit of modern navigational aids,
liferafts, radio, and warm clothing unlike the ancient Chinese mariners.
'Anything that will enhance safety will be aboard, but will only be used as
backups. We shall be eating similar foods to those used then and be using
replicas of early Chinese compasses and star-angle measuring devices to
navigate'.
So what drives this slightly-built Englishman who settled happily in a small
village in the west of Ireland 20 years ago, to continue undertaking such
risky expeditions?
He says: 'I enjoy doing them. It is as simple as that. It is an intellectual
challenge rather than a physical one. I hope this voyage, like the other
ones, will demonstrate that the technology existed then to enable travel
from one side of the ocean to the other'.
As with the Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expeditions, and his own previous
adventures, Severin recognises that a successful conclusion of the China
voyage will not necessarily prove that maritime contact across the oceans
was achieved in pre-Christian times.
'What it will do is symbolise that various voyages could have taken place.
We are focussing on one that was recorded as having set off in the Annals of
China, although nothing was ever heard of them again.'
'What those mariners would have carried with them, are not so much
archaeological artefacts that would have survived through time but their
intellectual baggage - their knowledge of calendars and astronomy, their
writing and art, and their building skills. These could have been passed on
and survived if they reached their destination,' he said. Severin hopes to
make his own landfall in the New World in October.

'HEROIC' VOYAGER, ITS HUMAN GUIDES 




The most prominent feature in Voyager's photographs of Neptune is a huge oblong 
blob that mars the planet's serene blue cloud surface. This has been officially 
dubbed the Great Dark Spot. 


Privately, Voyager project scientists have a better name for it. 


They call it "Exxon."

TV REVIEW; 


'VOYAGE' TO A THREATENED PLANET 




By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 




"Life in the Balance," an "Infinite Voyage" special airing at 8 tonight on 
Channels 28, 15 and 24 and at 8 p.m. Monday on Channel 11, opens with a strong 
dose of statistics detailing mankind's impact on our fragile planet. 


 -- Airborne pollutants released each year: 5 billion tons. 


 -- Population expected in the year 2000: 6 billion. 


 -- Rain forest destroyed every minute: 50 acres. 


Impressive statistics, all of them. Unfortunately, "Life in the Balance" never 
lets up, affecting a preachy tone that limits its impact. 


And that's too bad, because that approach by producer-writer Joe Seamans gets 
in the way of some very interesting material. 


In segments on fragile ecosystems in Brazil, Peru, San Diego and Costa Rica, 
Seamans shows how technological advances are fragmenting the Earth. 


"Life in the Balance" demonstrates how all of the Earth's species are closely 
linked, explains how we are causing mass extinction of many of these species 
and shows how scientists are attempting to cope with the myriad problems. As 
one scientist puts it, "Man can be considered a human meteorite" in ecological 
terms. 


The program hammers home its point about man's negative role in evolution 
through this ongoing process of mass extinction. Our rapacious species is 
clearly overshadowing the planet, destroying plants, insects, fish and mammals 
at an astounding rate, tipping the balance in who knows what direction. After 
all, no one knows which species will turn out to be the "key" species in the 
food chain. 


Preachiness aside, "Life in the Balance" is, on balance, a worthy effort, as 
timely as today's headlines about the Valdez oil spill. We stand at a unique 
spot in history: Mankind has recognized the problems and has the power to help 
stem this mass extinction. The question remains: Do we have the will?

Jupiter bears the dark scars of last month's cometary bombardment. Any
amateur astronomer with a telescope can see a band of bold black marks
across the giant planet, some as large as Earth.
The 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 also made a powerful impact on
the public imagination - partly because professional astronomers had
prepared the ground well, for example laying on press conferences to brief
the media about what some predicted would be the greatest cosmic spectacle
since the invention of the telescope. Fortunately the show lived up to the
advance billing.
Why did it arouse so much interest and excitement? Although the television
pictures were impressive, showing fireballs and debris rising hundreds of
miles above Jupiter's thin atmosphere, we have seen more spectacular views
from space. Think of the close-ups of Saturn's twisted rings taken by the
two Voyager spacecraft in the 1980s, let alone man's first steps on the moon
25 years ago.
And for us as individuals, what we see in the heavens with our own eyes  -
for example an unexpected shower of shooting stars or the flicker of the
Northern lights - surpasses in beauty and visual impact anything we
experience through the electronic media.
The great appeal of Shoemaker-Levy lay in the event's unscripted cosmic
violence, spiced by imagining what would have happened if the series of
kilometre-sized rocks had hit here instead of Jupiter. They would have wiped
out most life on Earth, just like the giant meteorite that is believed to
have ended the dinosaur era 65m years ago when it left a crater stretching
180km across what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
The dark marks smeared across Jupiter's southern hemisphere are dust and/or
soot thrown into the upper atmosphere by the explosion of the cometary
fragments. Astronomers expect them to persist for many months. On Earth,
that much smoke and dust would plunge the whole planet into a sunless, icy
'impact winter'. As human agriculture and natural food chains collapsed, few
living creatures could escape starving or freezing to death.
Earth is a far smaller target than Jupiter; its surface area is 100 times
less and it weighs 300 times less. But the bombardment of Jupiter has
strengthened the hands of those who argue that we are at greater risk of
destruction by an aberrant asteroid or comet than astronomers had believed -
and that we should be doing something to protect ourselves.
Over the past 20 years or so, the view that Earth's history is punctuated by
cosmic cataclysms has moved from the bizarre sidelines of astronomical
theory to the mainstream. A respectable estimate now is that for an average
American or European the likelihood of dying because a comet or asteroid
hits Earth is similar to the chance of being killed in an air crash: about 1
in 20,000.
In Washington, the Shoemaker-Levy show has convinced doubting politicians
that the risk is real - not just a ploy by astronomers to extract federal
funds. Congressmen are rallying to support plans to spend Dollars 250m over
the next 20 years on an early warning network of telescopes. The proposed
Spaceguard system would map the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 asteroids and
comets whose paths may cross Earth's orbit around the sun.
Spaceguard would give warning times of impact with Earth ranging from
several decades for an asteroid with a circular orbit to perhaps a year for
a comet with a highly elliptical orbit. That might or might not be long
enough to send a rocket to detonate a nuclear weapon and deflect the
intruder into a non-threatening path.
However, for the thousands of astronomers, amateur and professional, who
observed the Jovian bombardment and are watching its aftermath, the
implications for Earth are very much a secondary consideration. They are
interested above all in learning as much as possible from the collisions
about the nature of Jupiter and of comets.
Few firm scientific conclusions have emerged yet from the vast mass of
observations. Previous space spectaculars, such Voyager's planetary fly-by
and Giotto's encounter with Halley's Comet, were based on specific
spacecraft, co-ordinated by mission controllers. The Shoemaker-Levy
collision, in contrast, is a free-for-all with no one in charge.
An unprecedent amount of data flew around the world's computer networks
during the bombardment, as astronomers exchanged the latest news by
electronic mail; indeed the event was said to have caused the first serious
jam on Internet. The lines are now humming with preliminary thoughts about
what to make of it all.
Key questions still to be answered include: how deeply the comet's fragments
penetrated Jupiter's atmosphere before they exploded; whether they arrived
as solid lumps or as loose aggregates of ice and rock; and what chemicals
were thrown into the upper atmosphere from the lower levels.
Shoemaker-Levy may have faded from the headlines but its marks on Jupiter
are proving longer lasting than astronomers had predicted. For Earth, its
legacy will be a better understanding of planetary science and - conceivably
 -an early warning system to save us all from a cosmic cataclysm.

GO VOYAGES, one of the largest French bucket shop travel companies, is
threatening to pull out of its long-running negotiations for a takeover by
Air France, the state-controlled airline.
Air France has for the past year been in discussions to buy Go Voyages, a
subsidiary of Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires, the French insurance
group. GMF is keen to withdraw from the travel sector and a year ago signed
a provisional agreement to sell Go Voyages to SOTAIR, the airline's travel
arm.
Mr Serge Fabre, chief executive of Go Voyages, said yesterday it would look
for other investors if Air France did not clinch the deal within a month.
Air France refused to comment. Earlier this year it announced plans for an
expansion of its travel activities by merging SOTAIR with the tour
businesses owned by Havas, the French media and travel group, and TUI, the
German holiday company.
Go Voyages has just emerged from a period in which it sustained heavy
losses. Mr Fabre yesterday said it had returned to the black in its last
financial year to October 31 when turnover rose to FFr378m from FFr366m in
the previous year.

SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER 




By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 




KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. 




The shuttle Atlantis roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 


Galileo, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the 9:53 a.m. PDT launching and is 
finally on its way to Jupiter. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 


The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 


It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the Galileo and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 


"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director Robert Sieck said. 


"It was worth the wait," said Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center in 
Mountain View, Calif., one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 


Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above Earth. 


And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for Galileo to reach Jupiter, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of Earth as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 


For a while, NASA officials considered scrapping the $1.4-billion project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as NASA reevaluated the mission. 


Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to Jupiter. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, NASA decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving Galileo with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 


Galileo was saved when engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to Jupiter without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push Galileo 
beyond Earth's grasp. 


The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give Galileo the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so Galileo will have to take the scenic back 
roads to Jupiter. 


After Galileo was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around Earth. 


The reduced speed left Galileo falling toward the sun. But, in February, 
Galileo will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing Galileo around and throw it back toward Earth. 


In December of 1990, Galileo will come within 600 miles of Earth, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using Earth's gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of Earth's orbit. Ten months later, 
Galileo is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 


In December of 1992, Galileo will make a daringly close approach to Earth, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 


If all goes well, that should give Galileo the speed it will need to reach 
Jupiter. 


It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 


Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if Galileo accidentally plunges down 
into Earth's atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 


That would require multiple failures, which NASA judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for NASA, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt Wednesday's launching. 


Although Galileo will send data back to Earth during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters Jupiter. Galileo will loop 
around Jupiter and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 


About 150 days before Galileo reaches Jupiter, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 


Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California 
on Monday at 12:39 p.m. The shuttle's pilot is Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley. 
Other members of the crew are Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen 
S. Baker. 




RETURN TO JUPITER 


After a flight lasting six years, the Galileo probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches Jupiter. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 


GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 


The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
Jupiter. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets Venus and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach Jupiter.

EARTH GETS VISIT FROM ANOTHER 'PLANET'; 


SPACE: IN REALITY, IT'S JUST THE GALILEO SPACECRAFT SWINGING BY ON ITS WAY TO 
STUDY JUPITER. SCIENTISTS ARE EXCITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW EARTH AS 
IF FROM AN ALIEN SHIP. 




By ANNE C. ROARK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




On its convoluted journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft swung by Earth on 
Saturday, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 


At 12:35 p.m., only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the $1.5-billion nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the Atlantic Ocean. 


"It was virtually perfect," said William J. O'Neil, Galileo's project manager 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to Jupiter. 


"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design manager at JPL. 


Saturday's encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the Earth and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 


Two extremely sharp photographs taken Saturday by Galileo, one of the Earth and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 


Whatever comes of these recorded images, Galileo will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the Earth after 
visiting another planet," O'Neil said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to Earth." 


It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the Earth and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one JPL scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 


Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the Earth encounter went, 
scientists at JPL realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to Jupiter can be labeled a success. 


The next major step will take place Oct. 29, when Galileo passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on Dec. 8, 1992, it will have its second encounter with Earth, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above South Africa. 


Both swings around the Earth, as well as a rendezvous with Venus last February, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
Jupiter. 


In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 


As Galileo raced by Earth, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When Galileo scoots by Earth two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to Jupiter, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 


When Galileo arrives at Jupiter late in 1995, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the summer of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into Jupiter's stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 


Galileo was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
Jupiter's four major moons with one of Earth's first telescopes.
