   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. said it agreed in
principle to increase by 25 cents a share, to $22.25 a share,
or $48.4 million, its tender offer for the 13.4% stake it
doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   The sweetened offer is part of a settlement of litigation
brought by certain shareholders of Caesars New Jersey. They
charged that, among other things, the company's original
$47.9 million offer was inadequate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Caesars World, an owner and operator of hotels and
casinos, also extended its offer to Sept. 7 from today, and
said it might further extend the offer until final court
approval of the settlement, which isn't expected for at least
two months. Caesars New Jersey owns and operates Caesars
Atlantic City, a hotel and casino.
   Caesars World also agreed to amend its offer to pay
interest on $22 a share if the offer is extended more than 30
days after the mailing of supplemental offer materials
describing the settlement and the amendment. The mailing is
expected this week.
   Caesars World also agreed that if it purchases at least
549,792 Caesars New Jersey shares, giving Caesars World at
least 90% of the outstanding shares, it will merge Caesars
New Jersey with Caesars World or a Caesars World subsidiary.
In the merger, shareholders would receive $22.25 a share,
without interest. Of the 2,175,945 Caesars New Jersey shares
that Caesars World doesn't already own, about 1.5 million had
been tendered as of yesterday.

   Caesars World Inc. said an agreement has been reached for
the withdrawal of a petition by a shareholder of Caesars New
Jersey Inc. with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in
connection with Caesars World's pending tender offer for
Caesars New Jersey shares.
   The holder had alleged, among other things, that the $22 a
share Caesars World is offering for the 2.2 million shares of
Caesars New Jersey it doesn't already own was inadequate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Caesars World said the withdrawal is provided for in an
amendment to its previously announced agreement in principle
connected with the settlement of certain shareholder lawsuits
related to the tender offer. Caesars World holds about 86.6%
of Caesars New Jersey's 16.3 million outstanding shares.
   As a result of the petition withdrawal, a New Jersey
Casino Control Commission hearing on the issue, previously
scheduled for Wednesday, has been adjourned.

   Caesars World Inc. dropped its $960 million recapitalization plan, which New Jersey gambling regulators refused to approve, and instead launched a tender offer to buy back 31% of its shares at a cost of $325 million to $374 million. 

   The operator of casino hotels began today a so-called Dutch auction tender offer for 11 million of its shares. 
Caesars said shares must be tendered at prices between $29.50 and $34 each. 
Under the Dutch auction procedures, Caesars will accept shares in the order of their specified prices, beginning with the lowest price, until the total reaches 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will then be paid to all shares accepted. 

   Caesars shares closed Friday at $29.25, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The offer will expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6 unless extended, Caesars said. 

   Caesars said it has been advised by its lawyers that the tender offer doesn't require approval by New Jersey or Nevada gaming regulators. 
However, the company, which has casinos in both states, said if the regulators rule that their approval is required, Caesars reserves the right to cancel the offer. 

   Caesars also said the offer is conditioned on arranging the necessary financing of as much as $400 million, including expenses of the offer. 
Caesars said the offer would be financed with issuance of subordinated debt and bank borrowings. 
The company said its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has advised that it is "highly confident" that the necessary debt securities can be sold. 

   Henry Gluck, Caesars World's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We believe that the purchase of shares through the offer constitutes an attractive investment for our company at this time because of recent market prices for Caesars World's shares, the company's reduced level of long-term debt and our business and financial prospects." 

   Mr. Gluck said the offer "should help to normalize the Caesars World shareholder base," which he said the company believes includes "a high percentage of short-term investors who purchased or held Caesars World stock in anticipation of receiving a dividend under the recapitalization plan." 

   The recapitalization plan, which was rejected Aug. 12 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, would have paid a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 to shareholders. 

   Caesars said yesterday it will withdraw its request that the New Jersey commission reconsider its rejection of the recapitalization plan. 
A hearing on the request was scheduled for tomorrow. 

   In rejecting the plan, the New Jersey commission said it "lacks any clear business" purpose and serves to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars devised the recapitalization plan to fight off an unwanted takeover bid from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, who currently holds about 11%, or 4.2 million shares, of Caesars World. 

   A representative for Mr. Sosnoff said yesterday that Mr. Sosnoff hadn't seen the offering papers and will withhold comment until he does. 

   In explaining its decision to abandon the recapitalization plan, in which the company would have issued $960 million of new debt to pay the dividend, Caesars said it was advised by its lawyers that regulatory approval of the plan was unlikely. 
Caesars also cited "volatility of the financial markets and the effects of delay and uncertainty." 

   Caesars said neither the company nor its directors were expressing an opinion on whether shareholders should tender their shares under the company's offer. 

   Mr. Gluck, however, said in a statement that the offer "provides all shareholders with a means of liquidating a portion and possibly all of their Caesars World shares without the market disruption that might otherwise occur if they were sold in the open market." 

   A Caesars spokesman said all trades of post-dividend Caesars shares, which were made on a when-issued basis, will be canceled because the dividend won't be paid.

   Two shareholder lawsuits seeking class action status have
been filed against Caesars World Inc. in the wake of its
announced intention to make a tender offer for the 13.4%
stake it doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, an
investor alleges that the company's $22-a-share, or $48
million, offer is inadequate and that it didn't seek
competing acquisition proposals. Another suit filed in state
court by four investors names 10 officers and directors of
the company as defendants and seeks an injunction blocking
the offer. Caesars World, based in Los Angeles, owns and
operates hotels and casinos.

   Martin T. Sosnoff said he had discussions with Pratt Hotel Corp. and Southmark Corp. about a possible joint venture to acquire Caesars World Inc. 

   The money manager and investor said that he, Pratt and Southmark may jointly discuss with Caesars World a "friendly" transaction in which the three would "participate on an equal basis" in a joint venture. 

   The discussions among the three parties "are not currently being actively pursued," Mr. Sosnoff said in a news release. 
He added that it was uncertain whether talks would resume in the future. 
While Mr. Sosnoff didn't say when the discussions had occurred, Pratt is understood to have initiated the talks about two weeks ago. 
Southmark, which owns 36% of Pratt, was brought in soon after. 

   Mr. Sosnoff wasn't available to comment, but a source close to him said "these guys (Pratt and Southmark) approached him and he thought it could be a good deal." 

   Dallas-based Pratt is a hotel and casino owner. 
Southmark, also based in Dallas, has interests in real estate and financial services, and is a major hotel franchisee. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff's $28-a-share tender offer for Caesars World, a Los Angeles-based gambling concern, was rejected as "inadequate" last week. 
He is Caesars World's largest shareholder -- with a 13.6% stake. 

   A Caesars World spokesman declined comment on Mr. Sosnoff's statement. 

   Separately, Mr. Sosnoff said he extended the expiration date of his offer for the Caesars World common stock he doesn't already own to 12:01 a.m. 
May 16 EST. 
The offer had been scheduled to expire on April 3. 
So far, Mr. Sosnoff said, "only a negligible number of shares have been tendered" under the offer, which began earlier this month. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World's common closed at $28.75, down 87.5 cents. 
Some Wall Street traders said that any Southmark and Pratt involvement with Mr. Sosnoff would make it less likely that a bidding war for Caesars would erupt. 

   Caesars World's financial adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is understood to have contacted a number of companies to drum up interest in a friendly purchase of Caesars. 
Southmark was among the companies that Drexel contacted in the past two weeks, sources said. 

   William S. Friedman, vice chairman of Southmark, said that "a prime factor in our getting involved is that we're licensed (to operate casinos) in both New Jersey and Nevada," where Caesars World has hotels. 

   Jack E. Pratt Sr., Pratt chairman, said Pratt and Southmark will say today in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they are having talks with Mr. Sosnoff on a possible joint venture. 
He said the companies "plan to work with Caesars on a friendly basis." 

   Mr. Sosnoff said that "several preliminary contacts" with Caesars World representatives haven't "resulted in any indication that (Caesars World) wishes to" negotiate with him, Pratt or Southmark. 

   The New York investor's bid had been conditioned on his obtaining approval to control casinos from gaming authorities in New Jersey and Nevada. 
Mr. Sosnoff said yesterday that he hasn't been assured that "the necessary regulatory review would be completed on or prior to the original expiration date" of his tender offer. 
He said if the approval process is delayed, he may have to again extend the expiration date. 

   A source familiar with both Southmark and Pratt said that while Mr. Sosnoff could raise the $725.2 million needed to complete his offer, the investor felt "he needed an experienced hotel operator to convince people he was serious about really" buying Caesars World.

   Caesars World Inc. is exploring restructuring or the sale of the company to a friendly suitor after rejecting Martin T. Sosnoff's $28-a-share tender offer for the gambling concern as "inadequate." 

   A source familiar with Caesars said that the primary options that the Los Angeles-based company and its financial advisers are studying are a management-sponsored leveraged buyout or a major stock buyback. 

   The suggestion that competing bidders might be sought spurred an increase in the price of Caesars shares. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Caesars World stock closed at $29.375 a share, up $1.375, on heavy volume. 

   But Caesars, which owns and operates the Caesars Palace luxury hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars New Jersey in Atlantic City, declined to say whether it had already begun talks with other parties about a competing offer. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, the company said that the mention of possible suitors "might jeopardize the continuation of any discussions or negotiations that the company may conduct." 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff, Caesars' largest shareholder, said he still seeks a "friendly acquisition" of the company despite its rejection of his offer. 
Mr. Sosnoff said he believes his offer is fair to all of the company's shareholders and represents a significant premium over recent and historic prices for the company's shares. 

   Mr. Sosnoff is understood to be considering the possibility of increasing his bid for Caesars. 
"He feels he has access to the means to up the ante," said an individual familiar with Mr. Sosnoff's bid for Caesars. 
"Whether he will is a matter of further study for him." 

   In rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's bid for the 25.9 million Caesars common shares he doesn't already own, Caesars cited "uncertainties" in the offer, including the New York money manager's ability to finance the bid and to win Nevada and New Jersey regulatory approval allowing him to become a casino operator. 

   Caesars said in the SEC filing that Mr. Sosnoff's bid "raises serious legal questions under the federal securities law," but didn't elaborate. 
The company said its financial adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., issued a written opinion concurring with its decision to spurn Mr. Sosnoff's bid. 

   Some stock analysts and Wall Street traders speculated that other possible buyers for Caesars might include UAL Inc., the Chicago-based parent of United Airlines, New York real estate developer Donald Trump, investor Kirk Kerkorian and Las Vegas-based Golden Nugget Inc. 

   But Mr. Kerkorian has denied that he is interested in Caesars and a source close to Mr. Trump said the developer has "zero interest" in the company. 
UAL officials weren't available to comment, but a source familiar with the company said that while UAL "could be interested," it "would take a long time and be a big hassle (for UAL) to get licenses" to own and operate casinos in New Jersey and Nevada. 

   Golden Nugget, which is already licensed to own and operate casinos in both states, has plenty of available cash if it wishes to make an offer for Caesars. 
While officials of the hotel and casino concern weren't available to comment, sources familiar with Caesars said that the company's management isn't likely to accept a Golden Nugget bid. 
"They'd rather have Sosnoff than Golden Nugget," said one of the sources, adding that Golden Nugget's chairman, Steve Wynn, "would probably fire everyone in a month," and that Caesars' chairman, Henry Gluck, "is smart enough to know that." 

   Neither Mr. Gluck nor any of Caesars' advisers have had any conversations with Mr. Sosnoff or his representatives since last Monday, sources said. 
But Mr. Gluck may be reeling from his first contact with Mr. Sosnoff as a bidder for Caesars March 8. 

   According to one source, Mr. Sosnoff first notified Mr. Gluck in a phone call to Caesars Palace that a tender offer was to be announced in a newspaper advertisement last Monday morning. 
When the investor reached Mr. Gluck by telling a receptionist that the call was urgent, the Caesars chairman was on the dais at a televised celebration of the 20th anniversary of Caesars Palace, which was about to begin. 

   The source said that the surprised Mr. Gluck is understood to have responded, "Marty, I always knew you'd come after me some time." 

   Separately, Caesars' lawyers appeared in federal court in Miami Friday to argue that a suit Mr. Sosnoff filed against the company should be considered instead in Los Angeles. 
As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff's complaint, filed last Monday, alleges that Caesars and its directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by approving anti-takeover measures last year. 
A decision on the matter is expected later this week.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World shares closed at $29.50, up 25 cents, on volume of 749,600 shares. 

   Under the original recapitalization, devised to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, Caesars holders would have received a one-time dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
The tender offer that replaced that plan will be at prices between $29.50 and $34 a share, or a total of between $325 million to $374 million for 11 million of Caesars 35.2 million shares outstanding. 

   "This is probably what Caesars should have done in the beginning," said Harold Vogel, a securities analyst with Merrill Lynch Inc., New York. 
He said the new plan leaves the hotel-casino concern with far less debt and would be more acceptable to New Jersey and Nevada gambling regulators, if regulators need to approve the buy-back at all. 

   The earlier recapitalization plan was rejected by New Jersey gambling regulators Aug. 12 on the grounds that it loaded Caesars with debt while lacking a clear business purpose and serving to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars, operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City in New Jersey, needed both states' approval for the recapitalization. 
After announcing the tender offer, the company said it planned to withdraw an application for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to rehear the recapitalization case. 
Caesars said it doesn't believe the stock buy-back requires state regulatory approval. 

   New Jersey Casino Control Commission Chairman Walter N. Read said he wasn't sure whether the commission would need to approve the plan. 
He said Caesars "has obviously gotten rid of some of the things we objected to in the recapitalization," but he declined to say whether he favors the buy-back. 
Nevada gambling officials weren't available for comment. 

   Industry observers said that the buy-back leaves Caesars more vulnerable to a takeover attempt than it would have been under a recapitalization. 
The buy-back "provides less of a guarantee" against takeover attempts, said Mr. Vogel of Merrill Lynch. 
He added, however, that "I don't see anyone coming in after these gaming companies now anyhow because of the enormous licensing problems." 

   Mr. Vogel, however, didn't rule out the possibility of Mr. Sosnoff making another pass at Caesars. 
Mr. Sosnoff holds 4.2 million Caesars shares, or about 12% of the total outstanding, and his stake would increase to 17.4% if he didn't tender shares under the company's offer. 

   Mr. Sosnoff hasn't been available for comment since Caesars announced plans for the tender offer Monday. 

   But Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said he "can't see Sosnoff jumping in at all." 
Mr. Roffman said he believes Mr. Sosnoff "saw the writing on the wall" when the New Jersey commission rejected the Caesars plan, and thus wouldn't tempt the same fate by renewing his highly leveraged bid. 
Mr. Roffman said the state commission ruling delivered a message that "we don't want someone coming in here and leveraging up a company to take control of it." 

   Under the buy-back, which began yesterday, Caesars will purchase about 31% of its shares outstanding through a so-called Dutch auction tender offer. 
Caesars will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range, until total shares tendered reach 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the total will then be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 
The offer ends at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6, unless extended. 

   The stock market reaction to the new plan "shows that the arbitragers, who seem to be the dominant holders, are disappointed that Caesars isn't pursuing another recapitalization," said Mark Manson, an analyst with New York-based Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
But he said the buy-back leaves Caesars a "fairly attractive" investment, with a much stronger balance sheet and healthier earnings potential than if the company had followed through with the recapitalization.

<HL> Caesars World Recapitalization Plan
Is Rejected by New Jersey Commission

   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission rejected Caesars World Inc.'s proposed $960 million recapitalization, saying it "lacks any clear business purpose." 

   Commission Chairman Walter N. Read said he had "very real doubt about the financial responsibility of the proposal," which Caesars designed earlier this year to thwart a takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 
Mr. Sosnoff in June dropped a sweetened $35-a-share bid for the company and said he couldn't justify the cost of continuing the $1.11 billion takeover effort. 
He couldn't be reached yesterday to comment on the ruling. 

   The recapitalization plan, which calls for Caesars' shareholders to receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, was approved by shareholders last month. 

   Mr. Read said the plan will burden Caesars with "staggering debt." 
He added that Caesars' management "proposes to pile on this financial burden to pay shareholders a huge dividend to foster their approval of proposals, which will greatly enrich and permanently entrench present corporate officials." 

   Los Angeles-based Caesars, operator of the Caesars Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey, said it was "disappointed" with the commission's ruling, but declined to comment further. 
The company is awaiting an Aug. 20 ruling from the Nevada Gaming Commission on the recapitalization plan. 

   The New Jersey commission, which has regulatory authority over the state's gambling operations and is empowered to issue and revoke gambling licenses, voted 4-1 against the plan. 
A favorable vote by at least four commissioners was required for approval of the Caesars plan. 

   Commissioner Valerie H. Armstrong cast the only vote in support of the plan, saying Caesars had provided sufficient evidence that it wouldn't buckle under the strain of the $960 million of new debt required to finance the recapitalization. 

   After the commission's action, one Wall Street executive suggested that Caesars might sell its New Jersey operations, using proceeds to help recapitalize the company -- a move that would be similar to one by Los Angeles-based Hilton Hotels Corp. 
After New Jersey in 1985 denied Hilton a casino license for its $300 million Atlantic City hotel, it sold the property to New York real estate developer Donald Trump. 

   Mr. Sosnoff had dropped his bid one week after receiving an unfavorable federal court ruling. 
In June, a federal judge in Los Angeles enjoined him from continuing his tender offer on the ground that it violated a Federal Reserve Board rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 

   Still, Mr. Read rejected Caesars' claim that it needed to proceed with the recapitalization even after Mr. Sosnoff dropped his bid. 
"It is unclear why another takeover effort would be inevitable, considering the results of the last such effort and the regulatory hurdles involved," Mr. Read said. 
He also said it wasn't clear "why a takeover would necessarily be disadvantageous to the stockholders if the bidder received regulatory approvals." 

   In issuing its ruling, the commission attempted to distinguish the Caesars plan from a similar $2.6 billion recapitalization of Holiday Corp. approved by the commission in April. 
Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday, a hotel and gambling concern, proposed its plan last November when it was rumored to be a takeover target. 

   Mr. Read described the Holiday plan as essentially "an acceleration" of a long-term strategy to dispose of assets and move toward managing properties instead of owning them. 
But he said that Caesars recapitalization plan would replace an existing policy of pursuing internal growth and expansion. 
He added that Caesars proposes to "abandon a prudent, successful corporate strategy for an imprudent, risky one." 
The company's equity, he added, would become "a lowly foothill beneath its Alpine debt." 

   Securities analysts who follow the gambling industry were surprised by the New Jersey commission's action. 
And one said he expects Caesars to appeal the ruling. 

   "It's palpably absurd, especially because this is the commission" that approved the Holiday Corp. plan, said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "Caesars has adequately demonstrated that its cash flows are such that it won't have to sell one asset, and can still generate cash to service the debt. 
That suggests the company is very, very strong," Mr. Eisenberg said. 

   The New Jersey action came after the close of the stock market yesterday. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars shares closed at $35.125, off 12.5 cents. 

   Caesars operates its Atlantic City hotel-casino through an 86.6%-owned subsidiary, Caesars New Jersey Inc.

Anticipate Competing Bids for Concern

   Caesars World Inc.'s stock price rose sharply yesterday, indicating that investors expect competing bids to follow New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff's $28-a-share offer for the Los Angeles-based gambling concern. 

   Meanwhile, Henry Gluck, chairman of Caesars, said the company's board will study the Sosnoff offer with legal and financial advisers before making a recommendation to holders. 
A spokesman declined to comment further on Mr. Sosnoff's offer, valued at $725.2 million, for the Caesars shares he doesn't already own. 

   Mr. Sosnoff holds a 13.6% stake in Caesars, or about 4.1 million of the 30 million shares outstanding. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars common closed at $27.75 a share, up $3.25, on volume of 3.3 million shares. 

   Some securities analysts who follow the gambling industry suggested that higher bids are likely and that Mr. Sosnoff might have positioned himself to turn a profit on his current Caesars stake. 

   "He hasn't ever bought and run a company, and he probably would accept a higher offer for his shares," Dennis Forst of Los Angeles-based Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. said. 
He said yesterday's trading, in which Caesars shares rose as high as $28.50 before easing slightly, suggests that Wall Street believes "this is the first salvo (in bidding for Caesars), but not the last." 

   Mr. Forst said he believes Caesars management "definitely prefers to remain independent and build the company along current lines." 

   Marvin B. Roffman of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia, said acquiring Caesars at $28 a share would be "a steal." 
He said he believes Mr. Sosnoff's real goal is "to make money buying undervalued situations" rather than by operating casinos. 

   Among parties analysts mentioned as possible competing bidders are Los Angeles investor Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. and Las Vegas, Nev.-based Golden Nugget Inc., both of which have experience with the kind of luxury hotel-casino operations that Caesars World represents. 

   A spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian, however, said Tracinda isn't interested in bidding for Caesars, which operates the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas among other properties and owns 86.6% of Caesars New Jersey Inc. Golden Nugget officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who made his offer through newly formed MTS Acquisition Corp., continued to insist yesterday that his offer is "for real" and dismissed speculation that it might be an attempt to put Caesars in play in the takeover field. 

   The investor also gave some details of his financing plans, which he said involve loan commitments valid for six months. 
In a letter to Mr. Gluck, he said Marine Midland Bank had agreed to lend $100 million for the acquisition and to use its "best efforts" to syndicate an additional $400 million in loans. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also said in the letter that his financial adviser, PaineWebber Inc., had said in writing that, "subject to market conditions," it is "highly confident" it can arrange commitments for as much as $475 million in financing. 
He said the offer "provides a fair and generous opportunity for all the company's shareholders to maximize the value of their investment." 

   He made the tender offer for Caesars without consulting the company or its board, Mr. Sosnoff said, because his advisers had "repeatedly stressed" the Caesars management's "lack of responsiveness in the past." 

   Caesars World, which last year turned down Mr. Sosnoff's request for a seat on the board, retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help study the offer. 
Although Drexel traditionally has served as its investment banker, the firm also has represented Mr. Sosnoff before. 
It managed the investor's initial public offering last year of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., of which Mr. Sosnoff is chairman. 

   Mr. Sosnoff vigorously denied a report that he had tried to sell his Caesars stake to New York real estate developer Donald Trump. 
A source close to Mr. Trump yesterday said he had been offered the Sosnoff stake "within the last month." 
Mr. Sosnoff said: "That's absolutely incorrect. 
I haven't talked to Donald Trump at all about Caesars." 
He said Mr. Trump's attorney called him about two months ago, but said, "I never returned the call." 

   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said they were considering downgrading Caesars World debt ratings because of the Sosnoff offer. 

   Moody's said it is reviewing its single-B-1 rating on about $215 million of subordinated debt of Caesars World and its Caesars World Finance Corp. subsidiary. 
S&amp;P said it placed a total of about $231 million of Caesars World and the finance unit's debt on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. 
Ratings under study by S&amp;P are double-B on Caesars World senior debt and single-B-plus on subordinated debt of Caesars World and the unit.

   Caesars World Inc. said its shareholders approved the company's proposed $960 million recapitalization plan and payment of a special dividend of $26.25 a share. 

   The hotel and casino operator said 17.5 million shares were voted in favor of both the plan and dividend and 4.6 million were voted against. 
Among the shares voted in dissent were 4.2 million held by Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, a Caesars spokesman said. 
Caesars had 30.5 million common shares outstanding as of April 30. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff last month dropped his sweetened $35-a-share bid for the company, saying he could no longer justify the cost to himself and the company of continuing the $1.11 billion takeover effort. 
A week earlier, a federal judge in Los Angeles enjoined Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on the ground that it violated a Federal Reserve Board rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 

   Caesars said regulatory officials in New Jersey and Nevada have yet to approve the recapitalization and dividend, which the company designed to fend off Mr. Sosnoff's advances. 
The New Jersey Casino Control Commission is scheduled to review the plan next week, although Caesars said it doesn't expect the commission to reach a decision until the end of the month. 

   The Nevada Gaming Commission is scheduled to consider next Thursday the Nevada Gaming Control Board's recommendation that the plan be approved.

Seeks to Remove
4 Inside Directors

   Martin T. Sosnoff, whose sweetened $32-a-share tender offer for Caesars World Inc. was rebuffed, said he is soliciting shareholder consent to remove the company's inside directors. 

   In a letter to Caesars holders, Mr. Sosnoff said he is seeking to remove four of the company's nine directors, "leaving in place a truly independent board that can review my amended offer and any other alternatives available to the company." 

   In the letter, the New York investor and money manager said that the company's inside directors "have demonstrated that they are not principally motivated by the sincere desire to assure that shareholders receive maximum value for their shares." 

   To succeed, Mr. Sosnoff needs votes of consent from a majority of Caesars' 30.2 million shares outstanding. 
As the largest shareholder of the hotel and casino operator, Mr. Sosnoff already owns four million shares, or 13.3% of the common shares outstanding. 
His latest tender offer expires June 19. 
In accordance with Caesars' bylaws, stock of record March 27 is eligible to vote. 

   The directors Mr. Sosnoff seeks to remove are Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer; J. Terrence Lanni, president and chief operating officer; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   In Los Angeles, Caesars had no immediate comment on Mr. Sosnoff's letter. 

   Earlier this week, in a petition filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, Mr. Sosnoff unveiled plans to cut back some of Caesars' operations if his takeover is successful. 

   Among the suggested cuts, Mr. Sosnoff said he would close Caesars' Los Angeles corporate headquarters because it is "unnecessary in an industry where operational decision-making occurs on-site." 
He indicated, however, that he would encourage "substantially all of the existing management" to remain with the company. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also said he possibly would discontinue the company's operations unrelated to its hotel and casino businesses, including investments in retailing and some limited food service operations. 
He said the cuts could save Caesars between $5 million and $7 million annually. 

   To counter Mr. Sosnoff's original $28-a-share takeover bid, Caesars World proposed a recapitalization that included a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and the assumption of about $1 billion new debt. 

   In rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's sweetened $932.2 million tender offer bid earlier this month, Caesars said it might sweeten its recapitalization plan, which some Wall Street traders have valued at $30 to $31.50 a share. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars closed unchanged yesterday at $32.25 a share. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles. 
Only a few states permit such solicitations, including Florida, where Caesars is incorporated. 
The consent process "is an unusual approach with inconsistent results," said John Gavin, executive vice president of D.F. King &amp; Co., a New York proxy solicitation concern. 

   Asher Edelman used a consent solicitation in his successful bid to win control of Datapoint Corp. in 1985. 
Joseph A. Frates, an Oklahoma City investor, failed in his attempt to get shareholder consent to take control of Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. last year. 
And Irwin Jacobs, the Minneapolis investor, also was unsuccessful in using a solicitation in his abortive bid for Pabst Brewing Co. in 1982.

   Caesars World Inc. said investor Martin T. Sosnoff missed the deadline to present written consents from shareholders to remove the company's inside directors. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff, who is making a $32-a-share hostile tender offer for the gambling concern, last month began soliciting shareholder consents to remove from Caesars' nine-member board Henry Gluck, Caesars' chairman and chief executive officer; J. Terrence Lanni, president and chief operating officer; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also wanted to amend certain provisions of Caesars' articles of incorporation and bylaws. 

   Under Caesars' bylaws, written consents must be presented by the 60th day following the solicitation. 
The record date for the New York investor and money manager's consent solicitation was March 27; the deadline was Tuesday. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles, and just a handful of states permit them, including Florida, where Caesars is incorporated. 

   Separately, Caesars said a number of meetings had been scheduled that will relate to the company's petition for approval of a nearly $1 billion recapitalization plan. 

   The plan, designed to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's takeover attempt, would require Caesars to incur $960 million of new debt, and would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 

   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission tentatively scheduled a June 16 special meeting to review the petition. 

   The gaming commission also will review Mr. Sosnoff's petition for approval of his tender offer. 

   In addition, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has tenatively scheduled a June 10 special meeting to review Caesars' proposal to reincorporate in Delaware as part of the recapitalization plan, along with certain aspects of the proposed financing. 

   The board will then forward its recommendations to the Nevada Gaming Commission, which is set to review the plan at a June 18 special meeting. 

   Caesars said Nevada gaming authorities will review Mr. Sosnoff's offer concurrently with the company's plan. 

   Caesars cautioned that while it believes it will receive the necessary approvals from New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities, "There can be no assurance that such meetings will take place as scheduled, and the company is unable to predict with certainty when a determination will be made on these matters, or that such approvals will be forthcoming." 

   Caesars shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan at a special meeting June 12 here. 
That meeting is unaffected by the scheduling of the meetings with gaming officials, a spokesman for the company said.

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said Pratt Hotel Corp. and Southmark Corp. dropped their offer to join his $28-a-share bid to acquire Caesars World Inc. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said his tender offer for Caesars World shares was still in effect. 

   In early March Mr. Sosnoff said he made a tender offer to buy the 86.4% of Caesars World common shares outstanding that he doesn't already own, in a transaction valued at $725.2 million. 
In mid-March, Caesars World, the Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels, rejected Mr. Sosnoff's bid as inadequate. 
Caesars World also sued Mr. Sosnoff in federal court in Los Angeles to block the tender offer, saying the offer was "illusory" and merely designed to increase the price of Caesars World shares so he can sell his shares at a profit. 

   Last week Mr. Sosnoff said he had held discussions with Pratt and Southmark, who were interested in joining him in a friendly transaction. 
But in a statement yesterday, Mr. Sosnoff said Pratt and Southmark furnished a notice terminating the talks. 
Mr. Sosnoff said that he hadn't held discussions with the two companies since March 20, but that under an agreement the Dallas-based companies said they wouldn't make a competing tender offer or bid for Caesars World until they formally terminated their discussions with Mr. Sosnoff. 

   In Dallas, Jack E. Pratt Sr., chairman of Pratt Hotel said Pratt and Southmark ended joint-venture talks with Mr. Sosnoff because "both parties couldn't agree to move forward." 

   Mr. Pratt said he couldn't comment on whether Pratt and Southmark might make an offer for Caesars themselves or propose another joint venture. 
"We want to expand and we're looking at a number of opportunties, but it would be premature to say what we plan to do," he said. 

   Pratt is a hotel and casino owner, and Southmark, which owns 36% of Pratt, has interests in real estate and financial services. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said his tender offer expires May 16 at 12:01 a.m. EDT. 
In Los Angeles, Caesars World declined to comment. 
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Caesars World closed up 50 cents at $29.

   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
rose just hours after the company announced that developer Donald
Trump had invested in the gaming company.
   At the close of the day Wednesday on Wall Street, Caesars World
stock had jumped $4.12{ a share to $29.37{ in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit Trump with
being a shrewd investor.
   ``I take my hat off to Donald Trump,'' said Marvin Roffman of the
Philadelphia investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``It was a
wise investment to buy into Caesars. ... We've always felt Caesars
was one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt
it was worth up to $40 a share.''
   Trump has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether
his investment would violate antitrust laws. He filed notice with
the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission of his
desire to possibly buy more than 50 percent of Caesars World common
stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars World will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, ``due
to the confusing content of this notice,'' according to a statement.
Trump also refused to comment Wednesday.
   ``Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to
comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City, and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the notice, Trump said he ``has the good-faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   Roffman said, however, that Trump would not be successful in a
hostile takeover of Caesars World. In a similar situation last year
involving investor Martin Sosnoff, New Jersey gaming regulators
blocked Sosnoff's highly leveraged takeover proposal.
   In a similar situation involving Trump, New Jersey's Casino
Control Commission would probably also reject a highly leveraged
deal, Roffman suggested.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' the analyst
said. ``He has (accumulated) a debt of $1.235 billion outstanding on
his three Atlantic City properties.''
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls in
the state. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle casino hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under
construction and expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit from investing in Holiday Corp.
stock and a $24 million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock.
He also bought a small amount of stock in Golden Nugget Corp., a
move that his competitor, Golden Nugget Chairman Steve Wynn, called
a ``publicity stunt.''

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, disclosed a bid to acquire the shares of Caesars World Inc. he doesn't own for $28 each, or $725.2 million. 

   Under terms of the offer, which begins today, Mr. Sosnoff would acquire Los Angeles-based Caesars World, a profitable hotel-casino and real estate concern, through MTS Acquisition Corp., a company formed for the proposed purchase. 
The $28-a-share offer is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST April 4. 

   Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars World's largest holder with the equivalent of a 13.6% stake, or about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 
The $28 price values all of Caesars World at $840 million. 

   The offer is conditioned on the approval of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, the Nevada Gaming Commission and the State Gaming Control Board of Nevada. 
Those agencies regulate casinos in those states. 
Mr. Sosnoff also must have sufficient financing before the offer can be completed. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Caesars World closed at $24.25 a share, up 25 cents. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said in an interview last night that financing of the offer would be managed by PaineWebber Inc. and Marine Midland Banks Inc., Buffalo, N.Y. 

   Mr. Sosnoff declined to elaborate on why he was bidding for the company, pending a news release, which he said would be issued "shortly." 
He said, however, that he believes that Caesars World's management is "pretty good." 

   In Los Angeles, a Caesars World spokesman said the company hadn't been aware of the offer and that it would need time to study it before making a comment. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., has held a stake in Caesars World since 1983. 
Last September, Mr. Sosnoff filed for permission under federal antitrust laws to raise his stake in the company to as much as 25%. 
Mr. Sosnoff has asked several times for a seat on the board of Caesars World, a move that the company has rejected. 

   Some industry analysts suggested that Mr. Sosnoff, by bidding for Caesars World, may be hoping to attract the attention of other potential bidders. 

   "Marty has been trying to put the company in play for a long time," said Daniel Lee, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who follows the gaming industry. 
"I'm not sure he's serious." 

   Mr. Lee said that Mr. Sosnoff had plenty of opportunities in the past to increase his Caesars World stake, and had offered to sell stock to Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer, and others. 
"Why did he wait until the stock was hitting new highs to make a tender offer? 
It's a little puzzling." 
Mr. Trump couldn't be reached for comment. 

   A source close to Mr. Sosnoff said, however, that the offer was a "real" one. 
The source added that "commitments from the bank have been made and PaineWebber will do the subordinated financing." 
The source said that Mr. Sosnoff first retained PaineWebber in December 1986 and that the decision to make a tender offer for Caesars World is one "that he hasn't been planning out for a long time." 

   Caesars World long has been known as a casino that appeals to high rollers, although it recently embarked on a program to attract middle-income and lower-income players, too. 
Its chairman and chief executive officer, Henry Gluck, is credited with having turned around the company. 

   When Mr. Gluck took the helm at Caesars World in 1983, the company posted a loss of more than $21 million. 
For the fiscal year ended July 31, 1986, the company posted net income of $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million. 

   In the second quarter ended Jan. 31, the company reported net rose 6.8% to $12.6 million, or 41 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter's $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share. 
Revenue grew 16% to $190.4 million from $163.8 million. 

   Caesars World owns Caesars Palace, its flagship hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 
The company also owns a hotel-casino in Lake Tahoe, Nev., and another in Atlantic City, N.J. 
The company's holdings also include four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos and seven acres of undeveloped land along the Atlantic City boardwalk. 

   While industry analysts generally have praised Mr. Gluck and Caesars World's financial performance, some have said recently that the stock market long has undervalued the company's stock. 
Mr. Lee said that "$28 (a share) is getting pretty close to what Caesars is worth." 

   Besides his Caesars World holding, Mr. Sosnoff also has bought large stakes for himself or his firm's clients in recent years in such companies as Triangle Industries Inc., Loews Corp., Chrysler Corp. and New York Times Co. 
In the past, Mr. Sosnoff always has been a passive investor, buying and selling for investment rather than takeover purposes. 

   Last year, Mr. Sosnoff sold a 20% stake in his investment management firm to the public through a $30 million offering of about 1.8 million shares. 
He also sold $30 million of convertible debentures. 
Atalanta/Sosnoff had said it wanted the money to expand and for acquisition of financial companies.

   Caesars World Inc. said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 25% to $15.7 million, or 65 cents a share, primarily because of improved operating results at its Nevada casino-hotels. 

   Net income for the year-earlier quarter was $12.6 million, or 41 cents a share. 
Revenue for the latest second quarter, ended Jan. 31, increased 5.4% to $198 million from $187.8 million a year earlier. 

   For the six months, Caesars' net jumped 65% to $45.4 million, or $1.58 a share, from $27.5 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 10% to $421.6 million from $383.3 million. 

   Per-share earnings figures for the latest quarter and six months reflected the company's buy-back of 11 million common shares last October, which was offset by the conversion of its subordinated debentures into five million common shares. 

   Profit of Caesars' 86.6%-owned Caesars New Jersey Inc. rose 42% in the latest second quarter to $4.2 million, or 25 cents a share, from $2.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue increased 5.4% to $69.6 million from $66 million. 
For the six months, net rose 82% to $16.2 million, or 99 cents a share, from $8.9 million, or 54 cents a share. 
Revenue increased 8.6% to $160.3 million from $147.6 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $24.375 a share, but Caesars New Jersey stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $17 a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Separately, Caesars World said next month it will introduce its new line of fragrances in all of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.'s Broadway department stores in Southern California, and Lazarus department stores in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. 
Lazarus is a unit of Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores Inc. Caesars said it expects the fragrances, which had previously been availble at its resorts, to be marketed in about 500 retail outlets throughout the nation by the end of the year. 

   The company also said it signed agreements with Joan Hansen &amp; Co. of New York and Equity Management Inc. of Palatine, Ill., both licensing agents, to represent the company in national licensing of apparel, home accessories and gift products under Caesars brand labels.

Asks for Rehearing
On Recapitalization</HL>

   Caesars World Inc. said it filed a petition with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for a rehearing on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. 

   The commission rejected the hotel and gambling concern's recapitalization plan by a 4-1 vote Aug. 12. 
One commissioner argued that the plan, which would give Caesars' shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, "lacks any clear business purpose" and is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading down the company with $960 million of new debt. 

   Caesars, operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey, said that the timing of the rehearing, which might not be granted by the Casino Commission, is uncertain. 

   Caesars said it is asking permission to cross-examine one of the state's witnesses, H. Peter Gray of Rutgers University, who testified before the commission that the proposed recapitalization would seriously weaken Caesars' capital structure. 
Caesars said it is also requesting permission to present testimony of additional independent financial experts. 

   The company added that it is continuing to explore a variety of alternatives to the proposed plan, but added that it hasn't determined which it would pursue should the plan be rejected. 
As previously reported, industry sources have suggested that the company might restructure its recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
Another action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for Caesars to sell its Atlantic City property.

   Martin T. Sosnoff, who waged an unsuccessful takeover bid for Caesars World Inc. earlier this year, said he won't sell his roughly 12% stake back to the company. 

   The New York financier hadn't previously responded to the Los Angeles-based casino operator's offer, launched this week, to buy 31% of its shares for $29.50 to $34 each, or $325 million to $374 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World shares closed at $30, up 37.5 cents. 

   In a statement, Mr. Sosnoff branded the buy-back offer a "pusillanimous" effort to "purge" all arbitragers and "other shortterm professional investors from the ranks of Caesars' shareholders." 

   Officials of the hotel and gambling concern declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's announcement. 

   Mr. Sosnoff's response to Caesars World's offer is the latest episode in one of the year's longest-running takeover sagas, which began in March with Mr. Sosnoff's unsolicited $28-a-share bid for the company. 
Mr. Sosnoff later raised his proposal to $35 a share, or $1.11 billion, for the shares he didn't already own. 

   Caesars World's initial defense against Mr. Sosnoff was a proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. 
After New Jersey regulators refused to approve that plan, Caesars replaced it with the buy-back offer.

<HEAD>Trump Indicates He May Seek Control Of Caesars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump has notified
the federal government that he wants to buy 15 percent or more of
Caesars World Inc. stock and that he may seek controlling interest,
the hotel and casino company says.
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Caesars officials said they
were notified that Trump has asked the government for a ruling on
whether his investment in Caesars would violate federal antitrust
laws.
   The disclosure sent Caesars' common stock sharply higher today.
In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars was up $4
a share to $29.25.
   But gaming analysts said Trump, who already owns two casinos in
Atlantic City and is building a third, would face regulatory
obstacles to a move on Caesars in both Nevada, where Caesars is
based, and New Jersey, which prohibits single ownership of no more
than three casinos.
   The Los Angeles-based Caesars owns the highly profitable Caesars
Hotel Casino here and the Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe casino
hotels in Nevada.
   Neither Trump's filing nor Caesars' statement indicated how much
Caesars stock Trump may already own. Tuesday's filing was made under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals
to seek such a ruling once they have acquired $15 million worth of
stock in a company.
   At Tuesday's closing price of $25.25 per share, that would
translate to about 590,000 shares, or about 2.4 percent of Caesar's
24.5 million common shares outstanding.
   Susan Heilbron, executive vice president of the Turmp
Organization, said Trump had no comment on the filing other than to
confirm that it was made. She declined to say how much Caesars'
stock, if any, Trump already owns.
   According to the Caesars' statement, Trump indicated he ``has the
good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals, if any,'' to acquire 15 percent of Caesar's stock.
   Trump's filing also said he ``may decide to seek control of
(Caesars) through the acquisition of 50 percent (or) more of the
outstanding voting securities.''
   ``Due to the confusing content of this notice, (Caesars) is
unable to ascertain Mr. Trump's plans at this time and has no
further comment,'' the company said in its release.
   One gaming analyst, Marvin Roffman of Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said he doubts that Trump is serious about
making a move to acquire Caesars, and said any such move would face
serious regulatory opposition in New Jersey and Nevada.
   ``The gaming board in Nevada has come out and said it does not
particularly relish hostile takeovers, and I can tell you that this
would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously
defend its independence,'' he said.
   New Jersey gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile
takeovers of casino companies.
   Trump now owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels in
Atlantic City and is building the massive Taj Mahal casino hotel,
which should be complete in 15 months.

Offer for Caesars
To $32 a Share

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, sweetened his hostile offer to acquire Caesars World Inc. to $32 a share, or $931.2 million. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who is Caesars World's largest holder with a 12% stake on a fully diluted basis, last month launched a $28-as-hare tender offer for all of the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 

   According to an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Sosnoff's amended offer will expire June 19 at 5 p.m. EDT, unless extended. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff said, "We think our offer is better than the company's because it doesn't put the shareholders at risk and it gives them all cash." 
He added that an attempt by Caesars World to increase its offer "raises questions about whether the remaining shares of Caesars would be worth very much after a recapitalization" because the company would be adding more debt. 
Mr. Sosnoff added that "we're still hopeful of getting a friendly deal" with Caesars World. 

   But Caesars World is unlikely to be any more receptive to Mr. Sosnoff's second offer than it was to his first. 
The latest bid doesn't offer much of a premium to the company's own recapitalization plan announced about a week ago. 
Under that plan, Caesars would pay a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and incur about $1 billion of new debt. 

   Current shareholders also would retain common stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Last week, analysts generally valued the common stock after the recapitalization at about $6 to $7 a share, although some said the value could be as much as $10 a share. 

   The stock market has reacted favorably to the Caesars World plan, although in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars common closed at $32.125 a share, down 12.5 cents. 

   Some traders said last week that the price of the company's stock was bid up sharply after the company's announcement of its recapitalization plan on expectations that Southmark Corp. and Pratt Hotel Corp., both based in Dallas, might make a joint bid for Caesars World. 

   As previously reported, Southmark and Pratt Hotel late last month held talks with Mr. Sosnoff about conducting a joint offer with the investor for Caesars World. 
Those talks proved unsuccessful. 

   Terms of Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer for Caesars World call for purchasing 94%, on a fully diluted basis, the shares that the investor doesn't already own. 
An individual familiar with Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer said that the investor anticipates offering securities for the remaining 6.1 million shares with a value of $32 a share. 

   The individual said that Mr. Sosnoff on Friday received written commitments for $475 million from his investment banker, PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Sosnoff also has received $500 million in commitments from a group of banks led by Marine Midland Banks Inc., and expects an additional $25 million in commitments from those banks. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff had said he was contemplating a new offer for Caesars World. 
In a letter to Henry Gluck, chairman of Caesars World, Mr. Sosnoff said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction."

   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
surged Wednesday after developer Donald Trump surprised the gaming
industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he
could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company
without violating antitrust laws.
   Trump filed notice on Tuesday with the U.S. Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission of his desire to possibly purchase
more than 50 percent of Caesars World common stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   The filing was disclosed after the markets closed on Tuesday, but
Caesars Wolrld stock rose sharply in active trading on Wednesday.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, Caesars World
rose $4.25 to $29.50 a share. At that price, its 24.5 million shares
are worth about $723 million.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, which
it disclosed in a statement late Tuesday.
   The Los Angeles-based company said in the statement that ``due to
the confusing content of this notice, it is unable to ascertain
Trump's plans ...'
   Trump also declined comment. ``Such filings are very confidential
and he's been advised not to comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a
spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the filing, Trump said he ``has the good faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   But he went on in the filing to say ``it is possible'' that he
may ``decide to seek control'' of Caesars by buying 50 percent or
more of its stock.
   Gaming analysts spent a good part of Wednesday pondering Trump's
latest move.
   Marvin Roffman of the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia said Caesars is ``one of the best-managed
companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to $40 a
share.''
   But Roffman said New Jersey gaming regulators would probably
block any highly-leveraged hostile effort to acquire Caesars World.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' Roffman
said.
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls. So
far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino
hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under construction and
expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit in Holiday Corp. stock and a $24
million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock. He also purchased
a small amount of stock in the Golden Nugget Corp., a move that his
competitor, Golden Nugget chairman Steve Wynn, called a ``publicity
stunt.''

   Caesars World Inc. posted a net loss of $4.6 million for its fourth quarter ended July 31, after a pretax charge of $22.4 million related to its proposed $960 million recapitalization and other efforts to fight off an unwanted takeover. 

   In the year-earlier quarter, the gambling concern had net income of $14.6 million, or 48 cents a share. 
Revenue increased 8.9% to $201.6 million from $185 million. 

   Latest fourth-quarter operating net, including the $22.4 million pretax charge, was $2.1 million, or six cents a share. 
The net loss included an after-tax charge of $6.7 million from the redemption and payment of debt. 
As reported earlier, Caesars would incur $960 million of new debt under the recapitalization plan, which it designed earlier this year to fight off an unwanted takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   The recapitalization plan, however, was rejected, 4-1, by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission Aug. 12, a move that blocked Caesars in proceeding with the proposal. 
The commission tentatively has set Sept. 9 to consider a Caesars petition for a rehearing on the matter. 

   As operator of Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey and Caesars Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., the company needs clearance by gambling authorities in both states to proceed with its recapitalization. 
Nevada officials delayed their decision on the plan after the New Jersey commission rejected it. 

   In a recent affidavit, the author of a negative study used by the commission in its deliberations indicated that he may soften his objections to the plan. 

   The author, H. Peter Gray, professor emeritus of economics and finance at Rutgers University, said Caesars representatives met with him Aug. 19 and provided him with additional information "which I didn't previously have and wasn't aware of, and which, in some instances, was more recent than information which I had relied upon in writing my report." 

   Mr. Gray said he based his first report, cited extensively by the commission in its rejection of the plan, on information from New Jersey gambling authorities. 

   But securities analysts and others familiar with Caesars' bid for a recapitalization have expressed doubt that the commission will be swayed in any rehearing. 
Caesars declined to comment on its prospects for a rehearing. 
The company has said it is considering a variety of alternatives, including restructuring the recapitalization plan to include less debt.

   Caesars World Inc. said it began an offering of $265 million of 13 1/2% subordinated notes due 1997 in connection with its offer to buy back as much as 31% of its common stock outstanding. 

   The hotel and gambling concern will use proceeds to fund a portion of as much as $400 million that it may need to buy back the shares and pay related fees and expenses. 
Caesars said it expects to use bank credit facilities and liquidate short-term investments to raise the additional capital. 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is sole underwriter for the offering. 

   Caesars launched the stock buy-back Sept. 8 after New Jersey gambling authorities in August rejected a proposed $960 million recapitalization of the company. 
That recapitalization plan was designed to fend off an unwanted takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   Under the buy-back, which ends at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6, Caesars will purchase as many as 11 million common shares through a Dutch auction tender offer. 
It will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range of $29.50 to $34 a share, until the total shares tendered reach 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the total will then be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 
Mr. Sosnoff has said he won't sell his 12% stake back to Caesars.

   Caesars World Inc. said its board recommended that shareholders reject Martin T. Sosnoff's sweetened $32-a-share tender offer for Caesars, and said it might increase the competing recapitalization plan it proposed earlier this month. 

   The hotel and casino concern, which operates Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., said its recommendation reflects a fairness opinion from its financial advisors and "the lengthy time until shares could be purchased under Sosnoff's offer." 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York money manager who is Caesars's largest shareholder with a 12% stake, set a June 19 expiration date for his $931.2 million tender offer. 
He wasn't immediately available to comment on Caesars's rejection of his amended offer. 

   The recapitalization plan Caesars proposed, two weeks after rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's initial bid of $28-a-share, or $725.2 million, calls for a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share for holders. 
Caesars would incur about $1 billion of new debt under the plan. 

   Caesars didn't provide additional information about its recapitalization plan but said details of the plan, including its effect on the company's net worth, will be included in proxy materials to be distributed in late May. 
Caesars has said it would have a negative net worth after the proposed recapitalization. 

   In a statement responding to Mr. Sosnoff's sweetened offer, Caesars said its board "would consider appropriate adjustments to the (recapitalization) plan, including the amount of the cash dividend. 

   It said there weren't any assurances the dividend or other terms of the proposed recapitalization would be changed. 
But a spokesman said Caesars might decide to increase the $25 dividend proposal or otherwise sweeten the recapitalization "in view of the amended Sosnoff offer and the possibility of other developments." 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars shares closed yesterday at $32.25, up 12.5 cents. 

   Separately, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week, Mr. Sosnoff disclosed a list of prospective investors who have committed to help him finance his proposed acquisition of Caesars World by buying preferred shares in the acquired concern. 

   According to the filing, those investors include PaineWebber Inc., which has agreed to put up $44 million in financing. 
The New York investment bank is also advising Mr. Sosnoff. 
Other potential investors include Shenkman Capital Management Inc., T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund Inc., M.D.C. Holdings Inc., Integrated Resources Inc. and Hardrock Investments. 

   As previously reported, PaineWebber has delivered to Mr. Sosnoff commitments for $475 million of financing for the proposed acquisition. 
In addition, Marine Midland Bank has agreed to raise more than $500 million from among a group of banks for the proposed acquisition.

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, further sweetened his hostile offer to acquire Caesars World Inc. to $35 a share, or $1.11 billion. 

   Mr. Sosnoff in March launched a $28-a-share tender offer for all the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 
In April, after Caesars unveiled a recapitalization plan, Mr. Sosnoff raised his bid for the company to $32 a share, or $1 billion. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   A Caesars spokesman declined comment on the sweetened offer. 

   The latest offer, which expires June 19, differs from earlier ones because shareholders would receive a 30% stake in the company if it is acquired. 
The new offer tops by a slight margin Caesars' sweetened recapitalization plan. 
That plan was fashioned to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's takeover attempt. 

   As previously reported, the recapitalization calls for Caesars to incur $960 million of new debt. 
It would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the offer, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating that the plan has a total market value of $34.75 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Caesars stock closed yesterday at $34.25 a share, up 25 cents. 

   Terms of Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer call for the investor to buy 85%, on a fully diluted basis, of the shares that he doesn't already own. 
For the remainder, Mr. Sosnoff would offer securities with a value of $35 a share. 

   Those securities would consist of preferred stock, valued at $87.8 million, or $2.76 a share, on a fully diluted basis. 
The plan also calls for Mr. Sosnoff to provide stockholders with 30% of the equity of the acquired company. 
A market source estimates the stub would be worth between $2.50 and $2.80 a share. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff's earlier $32-a-share offer called for the investor to buy 94% of the shares he doesn't already own on a fully diluted basis, and to offer securities for the remainder. 
That would indicate that the cash portion of the current offer remains about the same as the earlier bid. 

   Caesars World so far has been unreceptive to Mr. Sosnoff, refusing to discuss with him his offer for the company. 
Mr. Sosnoff, for his part, has criticized the company's recapitalization plan because it would leave Caesars highly leveraged.

Of Rejection of Its Recapitalization Plan

   Caesars World Inc., reeling from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission's Wednesday rejection of a proposed $960 million corporate recapitalization, said it is reviewing alternatives that include an appeal or a petition for a rehearing. 

   Meanwhile, the unexpected negative ruling sparked much speculation about what other courses might be open to the gambling concern in its effort to recapitalize. 

   Among the possibilities suggested by industry sources, securities analysts and others is that the operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey might restructure the recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
That might make the proposal more palatable to the commission, which has the power to issue and revoke gambling licenses in the state. 

   Another, far more serious action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for Caesars to sell its Atlantic City property, with proceeds going into a new recapitalization effort. 
Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton Hotels Corp. sold its $300 million Atlantic City hotel to Donald Trump in 1985 after the state commission denied it a gambling license. 
Despite the setback that removed New Jersey gambling from its plans, Hilton has continued to grow in Las Vegas and in its hotel business abroad. 

   One analyst said it is unlikely Caesars would pull out of Atlantic City, given that the New Jersey operations accounted for 40% of the company's revenue of $694.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 1986. 
"Why would Caesars want to sell off one of its two good children?" he asked. 

   Trading in Caesars World shares was delayed until about 3 p.m. EDT yesterday, and the stock opened on volume of 400,000 shares, down $5.125. 
The price rebounded slightly during the final hour of New York Stock Exchange composite trading to close at $30.50, down $4.625, with about 1.3 million shares changing hands. 

   Caesars declined to elaborate on what alternatives it is considering. 
The company said only that it has 10 days to file a petition for a rehearing and 45 days to file an appeal, and that it will make a decision on the matter within the next week. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan, which calls for shareholders to receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, was designed to block a takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 
Mr. Sosnoff in June dropped his sweetened $35-a-share bid for the company, saying he could no longer justify the cost of the $1.11 billion effort. 

   The commission rejected the plan on a 4-1 vote, with one commissioner arguing that the recapitalization "lacks any clear business purpose," and that it is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading the company with new debt. 

   In April, the commission approved a similar $2.6 billion recapitalization proposed by Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Corp., a hotel and gambling concern, after it was rumored to be a takeover target. 
Some gambling industry sources suggested that the commission may have rejected Caesars' proposal in an attempt to discourage other gambling companies from using recapitalizations to thwart or to discourage takeover attempts. 

   One analyst said the commission's action could make Caesars a takeover target once again. 

   "This (ruling) could raise speculative interest, and someone could make another pass at them because of the commission's misjudgment," said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Bear Stearns served as an adviser to Caesars on the recapitalization plan. 

   Were Mr. Sosnoff to make another bid for Caesars, he would be likely to encounter resistance from New Jersey's gaming authorities. 
Commission Chairman Walter N. Read noted in his negative opinion on the recapitalization that Mr. Sosnoff "couldn't have taken control of the company" without the commission "finding that he was personally qualified to do so -- which it never has." 
The commission chairman said that under Mr. Sosnoff's plan, the company wouldn't be financially stable because of the "more than $1 billion of debt he proposed to load on it." 

   Mr. Sosnoff hasn't been available for comment since the commission ruling. 

   Nevada gambling authorities, who also have been considering the Caesars recapitalization proposal, said they weren't sure whether they would proceed with a planned Aug. 20 ruling in light of the New Jersey commission's action. 

   In a related move, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed its rating on Caesars' proposed $330 million issue of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures on CreditWatch with "developing implications," meaning that a raising or lowering of the S&amp;P rating could be forthcoming.

Casino Hotel Owner Calls
Plan Better for Holders
Than Bid of $28 a Share

   Caesars World Inc., responding to a $28-a-share bid by investor Martin Sosnoff, unveiled a recapitalization plan in which it will pay a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and incur about $1 billion of new debt. 

   The owner of casino hotels said it believes the plan is better for shareholders than Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer because it will allow holders to retain their shares and "their equity participation in the company's future growth." 

   However, the dividend payment and retirement of $222.5 million of existing debt would wipe out Caesars's shareholders equity and would result in a negative net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- of about $700 million. 

   Caesars said its investment bankers, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. have advised that the company would have sufficient funds for operating cash and capital requirements. 
Caesars also said it expects to continue to receive an unqualified opinion from its outside auditors. 

   After the proposed recapitalization, Caesars said net income for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1988, would be about $28.7 million, or 76 cents a share, based on a projected 37.8 million common shares and equivalent shares outstanding. 
In fiscal 1986, Caesars had net of $41 million, or $1.36 a share. 
The concern didn't project earnings for the current fiscal year. 

   The plan is subject to approval by shareholders and gambling regulators in Nevada and New Jersey. 
Caesars said it will schedule a special shareholder meeting in June to vote on the recapitalization plan. 
Record and payment dates for the dividend would be set later. 

   Caesars said the $1 billion in new debt will include $200 million in bank borrowings and $800 million of debt securities to be sold by Drexel. 
The securities are expected to be of the high-yield, low-rated or unrated variety known as junk bonds. 

   Caesars said Drexel has advised that "based on customary conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange the entire financing necessary to consummate the recapitalization." 

   Drexel's participation in the transaction and its issuance of its usual "highly confident" letter indicates that the firm is continuing its strong presence in the junk bond market despite government investigations into its activities as part of the widening insider-trading probe. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff described Caesars's offer as "conjectural," in terms of its value. 
"We don't know what the financial terms will be at the point at which Drexel raises the capital for the deal," Mr. Sosnoff said. 
If, for example, interest rates for the high-yield securities rise 100 basis points in the next three months, Caesars's projections of earnings could be slashed by a third, he said. 

   The recapitalization plan also would result in substantial dilution to shareholders, Mr. Sosnoff contended. 
"A management that owned less than 1% is suddenly being given a substantially higher stake in the company. 
That can't be good news for existing shareholders," he said. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said he is beginning talks with new joint venture partners to create a new financial package. 
In any case, his $28-a-share offer for Caesars "isn't the last word." 
Last week, the investor said Pratt Hotel Corp. and Southmark Corp. dropped their offer to join his $28 bid to acquire Caesars. 

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of Caesars, said the recapitalization plan "will not require the sale of assets or the layoff of any employees. 
We are going to have positive earnings from operations." 

   Under the recapitalization, Caesars shareholders would receive cash later than under Mr. Sosnoff's offer, and would hold shares in a riskier, debt-laden company. 

   Mr. Gluck said he believes the plan is "financially superior" to Mr. Sosnoff's $725.2 million offer and projected that by 1992, Caesars would retire $267 million of the new debt and would have net income of $86.2 million. 

   But in an interview yesterday, Mr. Gluck declined to predict the market value of Caesars's shares after the recapitalization. 
"We won't really know until tomorrow," Mr. Gluck said, referring to the opening of trading in Caesars today. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars closed Friday at $29.25 a share, up 25 cents. 
As of Jan. 31, the company's equity was $298.8 million. 

   Real estate developer Donald Trump, who previously forced Holiday Corp. into a debt-heavy recapitalization, said that Caesars's plan is "a good deal for stockholders but a bad deal for the company." 

   Mr. Trump, who controls four Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, said he believes that several gambling industry companies have such high debt service costs that they are failing to invest in their primary businesses. 

   Under the plan, Caesars also would change its state of incorporation to Delaware from Florida and institute certain anti-takeover provisions. 

   Among them would be a so-called "fair price" provision requiring approval by an 80% majority of shares for transactions in which a stockholder has a stake of 15% or more. 
Shares held by the holders of 15% or more wouldn't count toward the 80% requirement. 
Directors, however, could waive the requirement. 

   The move to Delaware incorporation, Mr. Gluck said, is motivated partly by a state law there allowing companies to limit the personal liability of directors for damages in potential lawsuits by holders. 

   In addition, the recapitalization would grant 1.5 million common shares to 40 top managers at Caesars. 
Ownership rights would vest over a period of eight years. 
And an additional 1.5 million shares would be reserved for future grants to key managers and employees. 

   "The company's management team is facing substantial challenges as we face paying off the approximately $1 billion of debt which we are incurring in connection with the recapitalization," Mr. Gluck said, adding that the share grants are intended to retain managers and provide incentives for them. 

   Caesars said it is likely that the $25 dividend would be taxed at ordinary income rates, but only to the extent of the company's total profits this year through July 31, 1987, which it estimated would be about $7 a share. 
The remaining amount of the dividend would reduce a holder's tax basis in the shares and wouldn't be taxable, unless it exceeded the amount of the tax basis, the company said. 
Any excess over the tax basis would be taxed at capital gains rates, Caesars said. 

   However, Caesars said that the Internal Revenue Service might challenge certain aspects of the tax treatment of the recapitalization. 
Caesars also said it doesn't intend to seek a ruling from the IRS on tax consequences of the dividend. 

   Caesars said holders who want to assure themselves of capital-gains tax treatment should sell their shares before the recapitalization takes effect. 

   In early March, Mr. Sosnoff launched the $725.2 million tender offer for the 86.4% of Caesars shares that he doesn't already own. 
Caesars's directors urged holders to reject the offer, which expires 12:01 a.m. EDT on May 16.

   Caesars World Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here against Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor who began an unsolicited $28-a-share tender offer for the company last week. 

   The gaming concern alleged in its complaint that Mr. Sosnoff's offer, valued at $725.2 million, is "illusory" and "designed to manipulate the market" to allow the investor to sell his current Caesars holdings at a substantial profit. 
Mr. Sosnoff holds a 13.6% stake in Caesars, or 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 

   Caesars also said that certain information about the tender offer in Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed by Mr. Sosnoff is "deliberately false and misleading," including some details of Mr. Sosnoff's financing plans. 

   The suit, which also names MTS Acquisition Corp., the company Mr. Sosnoff formed for the acquisition, seeks to enjoin the tender offer and to require Mr. Sosnoff to correct all of the allegedly false statements. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff wasn't available for comment. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff filed suit in a U.S. court last week against Caesars, alleging that the company and its directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by approving anti-takeover measures last year. 
Late last week Caesars rejected Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer as "inadequate" and said it is exploring restructuring or the sale of the company to a friendly suitor. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars closed at $29.50 a share, up 12.5 cents.

Speculators Are Gambling That Casino Stocks
Have Above-Average Odds for More Profit

   The easy money has already been made in Atlantic City, traders say. 
But a few speculators are betting on Resorts International, Caesars World and Showboat. 

   Although they've wilted recently, shares of many companies with big stakes in Atlantic City are at lofty levels. 
That's partly because Donald Trump last year showed that gambling concerns had valuable assets that weren't reflected in their stock prices. 

   Mr. Trump, before gaining control of Resorts International, prompted Holiday and Bally Manufacturing to boost their stocks by restructuring their operations. 
Martin Sosnoff's bid for Caesars World could have the same result if nobody tops his offer, money managers say. 

   But many casino stocks now reflect their asset values and profit prospects, analysts say. 
The group trades at about 16 times expected 1987 earnings, compared with a multiple of 12 or 13 last year, says Steve Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. 
With gambling revenue growing slowly while wagering facilities multiply, Atlantic City profit could be disappointing for some casinos in 1987 and 1988, analysts add. 

   Casino buffs think some stocks have above-average odds. 
Resorts and Showboat are trading far below their asset values. 
Both are scheduled to open new casinos in 1987 and should lure novelty-seeking gamblers from Bally and other competitors, money managers say. 
Caesars' Las Vegas operation and its 87%-owned Caesars News Jersey attract upscale gamblers and are expected to do well. 

   Besides their earnings prospects, the stocks are magnets for some rank speculation. 
Some traders hope Mr. Trump might eventually take Resorts private, buying the outstanding shares at a big premium. 
Caesars New Jersey shares might also be bought if the parent goes private or is acquired, traders add. 
Showboat for two years has been 9.8%-owned by Baron Capital, a New York money manager, and is considered a potential restructuring candidate. 

   Mr. Trump says, "I have no interest in buying (the rest of) the Resorts stock." 
Caesars won't comment, saying it's still "looking at the alternatives." 
Ron Baron of Baron Capital says, "I don't expect to do anything hostile with a company." 

   Resorts is everybody's favorite. 
Its giant Taj Mahal casino, due to open in late 1987, should boost profit significantly, analysts say. 
And Mr. Trump's fans think he'll move fast to develop Resorts' huge land holdings in Atlantic City. 

   "Perhaps," says Mr. Trump. 
"The land is just being looked at right now." 

   Speculation that Mr. Trump might take Resorts private hinges on a theory that he won't want to share profit from Resorts' developments -- and he won't like public disclosure. 
Developers hate tipping off competitors about details and timing of their plans, says one casino executive. 
But Mr. Trump says disclosure "isn't a problem." 

   Mr. Trump has agreed to pay $101 million for 585,000 Resorts Class B shares with 73% of the votes, leaving 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding. 
At 58 yesterday, the Class A shares traded at about 58% of their asset value, analysts say. 
But it would cost Resorts $485 million to redeem the Class A shares at $85, a price traders want. 

   Resorts' main concern is to complete its $525 million Taj Mahal, says Andrew Racz, an investment banker at Philips, Appel &amp; Walden. 
Mr. Trump doesn't want the Class A shares because they have almost no voting power, adds an industry executive. 

   Mr. Trump controls four Atlantic City casinos, one more than allowed by New Jersey law, including two Resorts' operations and two of his own. 
There's speculation he'll turn Resorts' older casino into a luxury hotel or convention center. 

   Caesars World, at 29 3/8 yesterday, has assets of $30 to $35 a share, analysts estimate. 
The stock is trading above Mr. Sosnoff's $28-a-share bid but has been weak recently because of fears he might take "greenmail" for his 13.6% stake. 
After rebuffing Mr. Sosnoff, Caesars World sued the investor Tuesday, saying, among other things, that he earlier expressed interest in selling shares to the company at a premium. 

   "We believe the lawsuit to be without merit," Mr. Sosnoff says through a spokesman. 
"I would still like to do a friendly transaction and work with Caesars to maximize values for all shareholders." 

   There are about two million Caesars New Jersey shares in public hands. 
At 15 7/8 yesterday, they might be bought in at prices "in the low 20s," speculates one holder. 
But the parent might not care to do that. 
It already consolidates 87% of the subsidiary's profit and, if it wanted, could get 87% of the cash flow through dividends, accountants say. 

   Showboat, at 28 1/8 yesterday, is "the purest play on Atlantic City," says Mark Manson of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
Most casinos pursue big spenders, but Showboat's Las Vegas site lures "the kind of people who walk the streets of Atlantic City," says one fan. 

   Its Atlantic City operation, slated to open soon, could more than double operating profit to $3 a share in the year ending June 30, 1988, says Ron Baron of Baron Capital. 
Showboat's assets are worth $40 a share, he says, and could be worth much more in the future. 

   But all these stocks are volatile. 
Some of them might languish if Atlantic City doesn't prosper. 
Says Mike Esposito of Oppenheimer: "Digging for gold has got tougher."

   New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, who has offered to buy Caesars World Inc. for $28 a share, said the company has tried "on several occasions" to buy back his 13.6% stake in Caesars World. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the attempts were made "during the past year." 
He said Caesars World representatives, including Henry Gluck, chairman, proposed "various forms of consideration" for his stake. 

   He also said in the filing that the company representatives asked him to sign a standstill agreement prohibiting further stock purchases and barring him from taking "any action adverse to incumbent management." 

   The investor, who is chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., said in the filing that he didn't accept any of the company's proposals. 
As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff began a tender offer Monday for the Caesars World common that he doesn't already own. 
The offer is valued at $725.2 million. 
Mr. Sosnoff currently owns about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding, making him its largest holder. 

   Caesars, a Los Angeles-based hotel and casino concern, declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's filing. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World's common closed at $27.875 a share, down 62.5 cents. 

   Mr. Sosnoff didn't say in the filing whether he had been offered cash or securities for his shares. 
He didn't say exactly when the proposals were made, but sources said he was approached a total of three times last summer and fall. 

   The sources said Mr. Sosnoff was approached twice by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm that represents Caesars. 
"Drexel has been the chief intermediary here," one source said. 
And once, last September, Mr. Sosnoff is understood to have met with Mr. Gluck. 
The filing didn't indicate how much Mr. Sosnoff was offered for his shares. 

   Separately, Mr. Sosnoff sued Caesars World in federal court in Miami, alleging that its directors failed in their fiduciary duty to holders. 
The suit alleges that certain poison-pill provisions adopted by the company last March were designed to "discourage investor interest" and to "entrench existing management." 
Caesars declined to comment."

   Henry Gluck was in Las Vegas hosting a lavish, televised celebration of the 20th anniversary of Caesars Palace hotel-casino last month when he first learned of investor Martin T. Sosnoff's hostile tender offer for his company. 

   The Caesars World Inc. chairman didn't want to spoil the fun or tip off anyone that there was serious business to deal with. 
So instead of walking off the banquet hall platform to take telephone calls from Mr. Sosnoff and Caesars officials, the tuxedo-clad, normally reserved chief executive officer crawled on his hands and knees behind the dais to get to a phone. 
"The people around me must have thought I had a weak bladder," he jokes. 

   Fighting off an unfriendly takeover bid while trying to convince colleagues, customers and shareholders that a company is still alive and well can be a difficult balancing act for a chief executive. 
But Mr. Gluck is determined not to let the battle bring Caesars World to its knees. 

   The effort to maintain a focus on ongoing operations while dealing with the tender offer has been a test of stamina for the 58-year-old Mr. Gluck. 
To ward off Mr. Sosnoff's offer -- initially $28 a share, later sweetened to $32 a share, or $931.2 million -- Los Angeles-based Caesars unveiled a $1 billion recapitalization plan that would pay holders a one-time dividend of $25 a share and give them stock in the recapitalized company. 

   The plan was announced the day before the heavily publicized middleweight boxing match between Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler in the parking lot at Caesars Palace -- by far the company's biggest special event of the year. 
The timing may not have been coincidental. 

   "I felt if we had something meaningful to offer shareholders, we should present it when there was more publicity and notoriety about Caesars than any other time," Mr. Gluck says. 

   That wasn't an easy task. 
Mr. Gluck had a marathon week leading up to the Monday, April 6, fight. 
He led a three-day corporate strategic planning meeting, attended the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., and juggled meetings in between with Caesars' financial advisers. 
(Mr. Gluck also had been scheduled to give a speech at the bond conference, but bowed out because "the company I had planned to talk about might be a different-looking company soon.") 

   To complicate things, Mr. Gluck says, he was confronted with "the most unbelievable last-minute logistics for the fight," including a call from a Hollywood executive asking for ringside seats for his studio's 30 biggest stars as part of a promotional campaign. 
Sorry, Mr. Gluck responded. 

   The weekend was even more intense. 
Mr. Gluck began it in Los Angeles with an all-day meeting with lawyers Saturday, traveled to New York for an emergency powwow with Caesars directors to present the recapitalization plan, did telephone interviews with financial reporters, then flew back to Las Vegas late Sunday night to do a television interview to promote the Leonard-Hagler match. 

   By then, Mr. Gluck had been working nonstop for almost 24 hours, and the fatigue was beginning to show. 
He considered not doing the televison spot, but Caesars' public relations director convinced Mr. Gluck it was important to show he was in command of the situation; the executive was even persuaded to let a celebrity makeup artist hide the circles under his eyes in time for the 11 p.m. news. 

   Working long hours is nothing new for Mr. Gluck, who says he's never been able to balance his career with personal pursuits very well. 
"I'm uncomfortable taking a lot of time off work," he says. 

   But Mr. Gluck did force himself to take one big chunk of time off during his career. 
He was a millionaire at age 43 when he retired as president of Monogram Industries Inc., a Los Angeles-based industrial products conglomerate, in 1973. 
"I'd worked all my life and I'd never stopped to smell the flowers," says Mr. Gluck, who began his career holding down jobs as a waiter and launching a small advertising specialty business while he was a student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. 

   In the 10 years between Monogram and Caesars World, Mr. Gluck says he did almost everything he intended to do when he retired, including learning to ski, improving his tennis game, taking extended vacations to Europe with his wife and children, and serving on various educational committees. 
His one regret is that he never finished writing a satirical novel about business, although he still has the manuscript and hopes to complete it someday. 

   Mr. Gluck initially was seen as an odd choice to head Caesars, although he had been a director of the gambling concern for a year. 
The company was in its worst financial shape ever, and was reeling from bad publicity after its co-founders, brothers Clifford and Stuart Perlman, were found unsuitable to hold a New Jersey gambling license because of alleged business dealings with associates of organized crime. 

   Mr. Gluck was approached for the job because of his good reputation in the business community and strong ties with banks and other financial institutions. 
He quickly shook up the company by firing many executives; others quit in protest at what they viewed as Mr. Gluck's meddling. 
The executive also restructured the company's finances. 

   Despite his initial unease about being in the gambling business, Mr. Gluck appears to enjoy it thoroughly now. 
For a few hours after the television interview on the eve of the Leonard-Hagler match, and despite his being up for 26 hours, Mr. Gluck seemed almost rejuvenated as he strolled the casino floor greeting the high rollers and celebrities in town for the big fight. 

   "The toughest challenge in all of this . . . is to run the company the way it's been running," he says.

   Caesars World Inc. said that about 13.7 million common shares were tendered at $29.50 each under its previously announced buy-back offer. 

   Caesars' offer to buy back as many as 11 million shares for $29.50 to $34 each expired yesterday. 
The offer was conducted under a so-called Dutch auction procedure, under which shares tendered are accepted in the order of the prices specified by the holders, within the stated range of $29.50 to $34 a share. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 

   Caesars, a hotel and gambling concern, said it will announce the per-share purchase price "as soon as practicable" after the depositary has confirmed the total number of shares tendered and the prices specified by tendering shareholders. 
However, the per-share price probably won't exceed $29.50, since more than the maximum 11 million shares were tendered at that price. 
Of the 13.7 million shares tendered at $29.50 each, about 9.6 million were submitted on a guarantee delivery basis, which required delivery of the shares to the depositary by yesterday, Caesars said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars closed at $28 a share, down $1.50. 
Caesars will have about 24.2 million common shares outstanding after it buys back the 11 million shares. 

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor who earlier this year made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the company and retains a 12% stake, said he didn't tender any shares to Caesars World. 
He said he views his holdings as "a good, long-term investment."

   Caesars World Inc. expects to report per-share earnings rose more than 70% in the fiscal 1988 first quarter. 

   The hotel and casino concern said per-share earnings were 85 cents to 92 cents, based on about 33 million common shares outstanding. 
In the first quarter ended Oct. 31, 1986, earnings were 50 cents a share, or $15 million, on 30 million shares outstanding. 
Revenue was $198 million. 

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record quarterly earnings to strong performances at all of the company's properties. 
The company's flagship Caesars Palace in Las Vegas did particularly well, he said, while its casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., Lake Tahoe, Nev., and four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos reported improved results "across the board." 

   Costs stemming from an unsolicited takeover bid by the New York investor Martin Sosnoff in fiscal 1987 have mostly been accounted for, Mr. Gluck said in an interview. 
Those costs included an unusual pretax charge of $27.7 million for the year ended July 31 and after-tax charges of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter from the redemption and payment of debt. 

   In the latest quarter, Caesars World bought 11 million, or about 31%, of its shares at $29.50 a share in a tender offer prompted by the Sosnoff bid. 
Although earnings for the quarter will reflect changes in the corporate tax rate, results won't include other major extraordinary or unusual items related to the takeover bid or the buyback, Mr. Gluck said. 

   Mr. Gluck said it didn't appear that the recent stock market crash would have any immediate impact on the company's businesses. 
He noted that Caesars's Atlantic City property continued to lead the city's casinos in gambling winnings in October, which he attributed in part to the company's strategy of a balanced customer mix in all its casinos. 

   Caesars's retail merchandising activities are expected to double this year, he said. 
Introduction of the company's new fragrances, Caesars Man and Caesars Woman, is scheduled for December.

That Could Doom His Offer for Caesars

   Martin T. Sosnoff, facing a showdown in his $1.11 billion offer for Caesars World Inc., mounted a mail drive to cancel a Friday shareholder meeting that could doom his bid. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York money manager, said Caesars had refused his request to postpone the shareholder session until his tender offer expires a week later. 
In a proxy solicitation, he asked holders to support his move to adjourn the meeting for 12 days. 
In case that fails, he also asked holders to vote down a recapitalization plan designed by the Los Angeles gambling company to thwart Mr. Sosnoff. 

   The two sides have been battling since Mr. Sosnoff launched a $28-per-share, or $725.2 million, tender offer for Caesars in March. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   In April, Caesars countered with a plan to give holders a one-time $26.25-a-share cash dividend and leave them with shares valued at an estimated $8.50 each. 
The plan would encumber Caesars with nearly $1 billion in debt. 

   Mr. Sosnoff then raised his offer to $32 a share in mid-April, and again to $35 a share last week. 

   In Los Angeles, a Caesars spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's new proxy solicitation. 
He said the meeting for Caesars holders to vote on the recapitalization is still set for Friday. 

   At that meeting, Caesars will also ask holders to approve a series of new anti-takeover measures. 
Even if Caesars' recapitalization plan isn't approved, the anti-takeover measures could effectively derail Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer. 

   A motion to adjourn the shareholder meeting requires majority approval by those holders attending the meeting. 
Caesars' proposed recapitalization plan requires approval by holders of a majority of the company's shares outstanding. 

   The anti-takeover measures holders will consider at Friday's meeting include amendments to the company's articles of incorporation providing that certain transactions with holders of 15% or more of Caesars stock, changes in the company's bylaws, and attempts to remove directors from office be approved by 80% of the shareholders. 

   The company also is proposing to stagger its directors' terms of office, to reincorporate in Delaware from Florida, to indemnify officers and directors, and to provide increased employment and performance incentives for management. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Caesars shares closed at $34.75, up 12.5 cents.

   Martin T. Sosnoff said he lowered his stake in Caesars World Inc. to 4.4% of the common shares outstanding. 
The New York investor has held as much as 16% of the hotel and casino company. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Sosnoff said he sold 301,900 Caesars World common shares Monday for $13.50 to $14.50 each. 
After the sales, Mr. Sosnoff held 1,072,900 Caesars common shares, the filing said. 

   Mr. Sosnoff acquired his Caesars holdings between May and September of 1986 for $16.51 to $20.38 a share. 

   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars common closed at $13.375 a share, off 12.5 cents. 
The company has more than 24 million common shares outstanding. 

   In Los Angeles, officials of Caesars declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's SEC filing. 
Mr. Sosnoff couldn't be reached. 

   Earlier this year, Caesars devised a recapitalization plan to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from Mr. Sosnoff. 
Later, the company dropped the plan in favor of a stock buy-back and Mr. Sosnoff began selling his stake.

   A federal judge here derailed Martin T. Sosnoff's $35-a-share takeover bid for Caesars World Inc. in a ruling that would require the New York investor to start his tender offer over. 

   Judge William Rea late yesterday also ordered Caesars to delay for at least one month a vote on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan, which the company designed to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's efforts. 

   Caesars said it postponed a Friday meeting at which shareholders were to have voted on the recapitalization plan. 

   The judge's ruling enjoins Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on the ground that his financing plan violates a rule by the Federal Reserve Board that a purchaser may not borrow more than 50% of the funds used to purchase stock of a target company if that stock is to be pledged as security to the lender. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said he intends to appeal the judge's decision immediately. 
"I think this decision is absolutely erroneous. 
There is no precedent to support it," he said. 
He said he expects to recommence his tender offer within 30 days. 
Caesars said it is reviewing the ruling and declined further comment. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff had received commitments from PaineWebber Inc. for $475 million in financing, to be offered as "exchangeable preferred stock," and $500 million in loans from a group of banks led by Marine Midland Bank. 
In his opinion, Judge Rea described the $475 million of exchangeable preferred stock as "debt instruments" rather than equity, since the stock would most likely be exchanged for notes upon Mr. Sosnoff's successful completion of the tender offer. 
According to the rules of the Federal Reserve Board, the $475 million of securities would be considered secured by Caesars stock, the judge added. 

   The injunction would allow Mr. Sosnoff to begin a new tender offer, provided that he discloses information about his personal finances, spells out in proxy materials his probable intention to use Caesars' available cash to repay the debt for the acquisition and to sell off certain of the company's assets, including its Los Angeles corporate headquarters and its Lake Tahoe, Nev., facility. 
Mr. Sosnoff also would be required to disclose that regulatory approvals could delay his acquisition of the company as much six months. 

   Judge Rea's order calls for Caesars to circulate a disclaimer to statements it made in proxy materials that "the plan of recapitalization doesn't preclude a third party, including Mr. Sosnoff, from making a more attractive offer to the company's holders, either before or after the recapitalization is effected." 
Caesars also would be required to circulate to holders two memoranda from its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., about the financial effects of the recapitalization. 
The injunction prevents Caesars from holding a shareholder vote on the plan until 30 days after the disclaimer and memoranda have been circulated. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff last week mounted a mail drive to adjourn the meeting until after the June 19 expiration of his $1.11 billion tender offer, which he had sweetened earlier in the week from the previous $32 a share. 
Caesars directors rejected the sweetened offer and recommended that shareholders adopt the recapitalization plan. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts last week valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating a total market value of $34.75. 
But Caesars has valued the recapitalization plan at $35 a share. 

   The judge's ruling was issued after the markets closed yesterday. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Caesars common shares fell 12.5 cents, to close at $34.625. 

   In supplemental proxy material mailed to shareholders Friday, Caesars said it might change its proposed financing for the recapitalization by obtaining a senior floating-rate loan of about $100 million from "certain non-United States financial institutions" that it wouldn't identify. 
The company said that if it obtains the loan, it would reduce a planned offering of senior notes to $330 million from $430 million.

   Caesars World Inc. said its board "vigorously opposes" Martin T. Sosnoff's solicitation of holder consent to remove four inside directors. 

   Separately, Caesars plans to build a $150 million shopping complex at its Caesars Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 

   In a letter to holders, Caesars Chairman Henry Gluck and President J. Terrence Lanni said the board believes that "Mr. 
Sosnoff's ultimate objective is to buy the company as cheaply as possible. 
In furtherance of this goal, we believe that Mr. Sosnoff's 'consent' proxy fight is intended primarily to cause uncertainty and chaos among our shareholders." 

   Last week, the New York investor said in a letter to holders that he seeks to remove from Caesars's nine-member board Messrs. 
Gluck and Lanni; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   As reported previously, Mr. Sosnoff is waging a $32-a-share, or $931.2 million, takeover battle for the operator of casino-hotels. 
To fend off his advances, Caesars earlier this month unveiled a recapitalization plan that offers holders $25 a share and stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Caesars said it would incur about $950 million of new debt under the recapitalization. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars's shares fell 25 cents, to $31.125. 

   The cost of the Las Vegas project will be borne by Gordon Co. of Los Angeles, a developer of retail properties, Caesars said. 
Gordon will operate the facility and lease the property from Caesars Palace. 

   The complex, which will have a Roman theme, will include 875,000 square feet of retail space, parking facilities for more than 3,000 cars, and a 1 1/2-acre open-air "Roman village bazaar," Caesars said. 
The first phase of the shopping complex is scheduled for completion in August 1990. 

   As part of the new development, Caesars said it plans its own additional $25 million expansion to add 25,000 square feet of casino space, a 125-seat restaurant and various food and beverage outlets. 
Caesars will finance that expansion and expects to complete it in early 1989.

   Stock market traders and analysts are giving a higher value to Caesars World Inc.'s recapitalization plan, unveiled over the weekend, than to a hostile, $28-a-share, offer from investor Martin Sosnoff. 

   Caesars proposed to pay holders a one-time, $25-a-share cash dividend and incur about $1 billion of new debt. 
Holders would retain equity in a more highly leveraged Caesars, a Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels. 
Analysts and investment bankers placed the value of the equity at between $6 and $7 a share. 

   Takeover speculators yesterday pumped up Caesars World stock price well above Mr. Sosnoff's offer for the company, indicating that the market believes the casino company's complex recapitalization plan is considerably richer than Mr. Sosnoff's bid. 
Caesars closed yesterday at $30.625, up $1.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Traders said the closing price also reflected a roughly $1 discount to take into account the transaction's uncertainty and time lag, and a roughly 50-cent bonus to reflect the possibility of a higher bid from Mr. Sosnoff. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager who has several times sought a seat on the Caesars board, last month launched a $725.2 million tender offer for the 86.4% of Caesars shares that he doesn't already own. 

   As reported earlier, Mr. Sosnoff has said he is contemplating a new offer for Caesars. 
In a letter last Friday to Caesars Chairman Henry Gluck, Mr. Sosnoff said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction." 
Takeover bidders often hold out the possibility of a higher bid in return for a chance to inspect the target company's books. 

   Mr. Sosnoff didn't have any additional comment yesterday. 

   Should Mr. Sosnoff come back with another offer, "he's going to have to make it very sweet," said Marvin Roffman, an industry analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. 
Mr. Roffman said he regarded Caesars' 76-cents-a-share earnings estimate for its fiscal 1988 as based on conservative assumptions. 
Caesars' fiscal year ends July 31. 

   Analysts said that on the negative side, the Caesars proposal would sharply increase the company's leverage. 
The value of the plan could also decrease if interest rates rise before the end of the summer, when analysts expect the plan to receive regulatory approval. 
However, analysts asserted that the company had strong cash flow to pay down its debt and wouldn't have to sell any assets to fend off Mr. Sosnoff's bid. 

   The value of the $25 dividend would be reduced somewhat by taxes, analysts said. 
Mark K. Manson of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York said taxes and other considerations would reduce the dividend by about $1.50. 

   Caesars' $1 billion in new debt would include $200 million in bank borrowings and $800 million of junk bonds, or high-yield debt securities, to be sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York. 

   Gary Yalen, chief investment officer of Irving Trust Co., a large New York-based institutional holder in Caesars, said the high leverage could make Caesars' results "volatile and hard to predict." 
However, he said that "if management's earnings estimate is good . . . (the Caesars proposal is worth) more than the previous offer." 

   The heavy debt burden doesn't concern Dennis Forst, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. 
"They were heavily leveraged five years ago and their strong cash flow was able to alleviate that. 
I'm comfortable that they'll be able to work down the (proposed) leverage over time."

<HL> Sosnoff Drops Bid as Too Costly,
Clears Way for $960 Million Revamping

   Martin T. Sosnoff said he discontinued his $35-a-share hostile takeover bid for Caesars World Inc., clearing the way for Caesars' $960 million recapitalization plan. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said he could no longer justify the cost to himself and the company of continuing his $1.11 billion takeover effort. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   Last week a federal judge in Los Angeles enjoined Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on grounds that it violated a Federal Reserve Board rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 
The injunction would have allowed Mr. Sosnoff to begin a new tender offer, provided he disclosed certain information about his personal finances and intentions for the company. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said that since making his tender offer for the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels, he has incurred about $30 million in "potential obligations." 
He added, "I have reluctantly concluded that the cost of continuing the tender offer is too high." 

   Some industry analysts said they doubt Mr. Sosnoff's estimate that his costs from the offer could approach $30 million. 
"That figure sounds awfully high to me," said Marvin B. Roffman, a securities analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia. 
"I'd like to see a breakdown." 

   A spokesman for Mr. Sosnoff said simply, "His expenses are what his expenses are." 

   Mr. Roffman said that Mr. Sosnoff "certainly must be thrilled" with the increase in Caesars stock price during the past three months. 
The market value of Mr. Sosnoff's 4.2 million Caesars common shares and common share equivalents has increased to about $142.3 million from about $102.9 million on March 6 -- the last trading date prior to Mr. Sosnoff's offer -- when the shares closed at $24.50. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars shares closed at $33.875 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

   In conceding that the company's share price has risen because of his tender offer, Mr. Sosnoff said that on an after-tax basis his efforts "have produced virtually no financial gain for myself." 
He added, "I want to make it clear that I will not countenance being classed as a corporate raider." 

   Caesars said it is "pleased to be moving forward" with its recapitalization plan. 
Under the plan, Caesars would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating a total market value of $34.75. 
Caesars has valued its plan at $35 a share. 
The company said a special shareholders meeting to vote on the arrangement and on the special cash dividend is scheduled for July 8. 

   In March Mr. Sosnoff launched a $28-a-share tender offer for all shares outstanding of Caesars, which operates Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., among other properties. 
After Caesars unveiled its recapitalization plan, Mr. Sosnoff raised his bid for the company to $32 a share. 
Caesars later increased the dividend portion of its recapitalization plan to $26.25 a share from $25 a share, and Mr. Sosnoff sweetened his tender offer to $35 a share. 

   Mr. Roffman, the analyst, said he isn't surprised that Caesars is continuing with the recapitalization, because it would significantly reduce the company's vulnerability to future takeover attempts. 
"If it isn't Mr. Sosnoff, it could be someone else," he said. 

   Mr. Roffman said that while the recapitalization plan would leave Caesars "very leveraged," the company's plan is "the lesser of two evils." 
Caesars plans to issue $330 million of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures, borrow $200 million from a syndicate of banks and obtain a $100 million senior floating rate loan from "certain non-United States financial institutions" to finance the recapitalization. 

   In a parting shot, Mr. Sosnoff criticized the listing for "when issued" trading in Caesars' stub equity security on the New York Stock Exchange. 
He said it didn't provide "a reliable guide for comparing my tender offer to management's recapitalization plan." 

   He said the Big Board should consider in future takover battles whether to list "such nebulous securities as 'when issued' equity stubs." 

   Yesterday, a spokewoman for the New York Stock Exchange said there is nothing wrong with the exchange's listing practices.

   Caesars World Inc., buoyed by healthy results at its
Atlantic City, N.J., casino, posted a 63% increase in net
income for its fiscal first quarter.
   The Los Angeles-based casino operator reported net of
$22.9 million, or 95 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Oct. 31, compared with earnings of $14 million, or 60 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was essentially flat at $233.1
million, compared with $235.6 million a year ago.

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive, said the New
Jersey property's operating results more than doubled,
boosted by higher table-game win percentages, a 16% rise in
slot revenue and lower expenses stemming from its
cost-control program. "The improvement was pretty much across
the board," he said.
   At Caesars' Nevada resorts, operating profit at Lake Tahoe
fell because of lower table-game win percentages and a drop
in table activity. That offset operating gains at Caesars
Palace in Las Vegas, which also had a drop in table activity.
The Las Vegas resort benefited from higher slot activity and
improved debt collection.
   The earnings sharply exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
Caesars' stock was quoted at $31.25, down $1.25, in late
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, which analysts
attributed to the unsettled market.

   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. reported that earnings
for its fourth quarter ended July 31 fell 55% to $7.4
million, or 31 cents a share, from $16.4 million, or 66 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Most of the decline came from Caesar's Nevada hotel/casino
operations, particularly from low table-game win percentages
at Caesars Tahoe. In Las Vegas, a decrease in wagering
activity at Caesars Palace was partially offset by a higher
win percentage by the company over the same period a year
ago.

   Revenue fell 5.1% to $223.7 million from $235.7 million.
   Although Caesars' results were about what analysts
expected, the company's stock fell $1.875 a share to $11.875
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   The drop may reflect "growing nervousness over what the
problems in the Middle East and higher oil prices could do to
the travel business," said Lee Isgur, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   But Caesars has had other problems. Competition from new
casinos in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., has hurt
its business for the past few quarters. Caesars has also
blamed higher provisions for bad debts, as well as increased
casino payroll and operating costs related to completing a
two-year renovation and expansion program.
   For the full year, net declined 45% to $36.8 million, or
$1.52 a share, compared with $66.9 million, or $2.72 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.5% to $870.2 million from $902
million.
   Caesars said it bought back about 1.2 million of its
common shares during fiscal 1990, reducing the number of
shares currently outstanding to about 24 million. During the
year, Caesars said it also bought back $19.8 million of its
13.5% notes due in 1997.

<HL> Drexel Burnham
May Have Conflict
Over Caesars Role

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. stands to receive about $36.6 million upon successful completion of a nearly $1 billion recapitalization of Caesars World Inc. 

   But Drexel Burnham "may have actual or potential conflicts of interest" from its role as both the financial adviser and financing agent for the recapitalization plan, Caesars said in a proxy statement. 

   Caesars said Drexel Burnham issued fairness opinions on both a hostile tender offer by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff and Caesars' subsequent recapitalization plan, which Drexel Burnham will help finance. 
The investment banker said the Sosnoff offer is inadequate but that the company's recapitalization plan is fair. 

   Drexel Burnham couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Under the recapitalization plan, Caesars shareholders would receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and would retain stock in the company. 
The gambling concern would incur $960 million of new debt to finance the plan, issuing $430 million of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures -- both underwritten by Drexel Burnham -- and borrowing about $200 million from a syndicate of banks. 

   Caesars said that upon completion of the recapitalization, Drexel would receive total fees of about $9.7 million for its role as the investment adviser, about $25.3 million as sole underwriter of the note and debenture offerings, and about $1.6 million as the agent for the bank financing. 

   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., which Caesars also retained to issue fairness opinions on the recapitalization plan, will receive total fees of about $1 million, Caesars said. 
Those fees aren't contingent upon successful completion of the recapitalization plan, however. 

   Caesars also said it agreed to indemnify both Drexel Burnham and Bear Stearns against "certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws." 
The recapitalization would leave Caesars with total long-term debt of about $1.05 billion, including obligations under capital leases and current maturities, and a negative net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- of about $508.8 million, based on projections for July 31, the end of the current fiscal year. 

   Given the effect of the recapitalization, Caesars said it projects 1988 net income of $20.5 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue of $821.8 million. 
The company didn't estimate fiscal 1987 results, but in fiscal 1986, Caesars had net income of $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million. 

   Shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan June 12 in Los Angeles. 
As reported previously, Mr. Sosnoff has set a June 19 expiration date for his $32-a-share, or $931.2 million, tender offer.
