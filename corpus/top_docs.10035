the EEZ. While the regulations are viewed as an excellent start toward addressing the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance
species introduction problem, Congress now realizes that it is necessary to implement ballast water controls for
vessels entering the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ. The Hudson River is connected to the Great Lakes
through the New York State Barge Canal System which allows for the movement of commercial and recreational vessels
throughout waterways of New York State and provides direct access to the Great Lakes. As a result of this connection,
species released from vessels' ballast water into the Hudson River can migrate, or can be transferred by vessels navigating
the canal system into the Great Lakes.







Solutions







Congress has noted that high seas ballast exchange is ``not a panacea'' for prevention of unintentional introductions
of nonindigenous aquatic species. Other means of infestation such as attachment to anchor chains and vessel hulls
contribute to infiltration. Moreover, the effects of ballast water exchange on high seas and coastal ecosystems
are not yet completely known. Nevertheless, ballast water exchange currently appears to be the most cost and labor
effective means of reducing the probability of new infestations. Alternative approaches may be warranted in some
situations, or may replace ballast exchange entirely, depending upon knowledge obtained through a Task Force set
up by the Act.







International Recognition







The need for control of the introduction of nonindigenous species has also been recognized by the international maritime
community. The ballast water control regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes that were issued by the Coast
Guard on April 8, 1993, in large part, were based on ballast water control guidelines adopted by the Marine Environment
Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization at its 31st session in July 1991. The resolution
(MEPC 50(31)) which accompanied the issuance of the guidelines recommends that member countries issue guidelines
for the control of nonindigenous species into their ports.







United States Legislation







On November 4, 1992, Congress amended (Pub. L. 102&hyph;587) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and
Control Act of 1990 (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 4711(b)). This amendment extends the Act's applicability to vessels entering
the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The Act, as amended, attempts
to prevent the spread of injurious nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes through the ballast water of these vessels.
The Act mandates that the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Task Force created by the Act, issue regulations to
prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels
entering a U.S. port, north of the George Washington Bridge, on the Hudson River, after operating beyond the EEZ.

prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels
entering a U.S. port, north of the George Washington Bridge, on the Hudson River, after operating beyond the EEZ. 



The current regulations contained in 33 CFR part 151, subpart C, issued under the Act, cover vessels entering the Great
Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ and require the retention of ballast water or the exchange of ballast water beyond
the EEZ, by vessels subject to the Act. Further, as authorized under the Act, those regulations permit the use of environmentally
sound alternative ballast water management methods that the Coast Guard determines are as effective as ballast water
exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species, thereby providing the needed
flexibility to approve additional ballast water management methods that, in the future, may prove to be even more
effective than ballast water exchange. These requirements, as well as the other requirements contained in subpart
C of part 151, would satisfy the requirements of the amendments to the Act if applied to vessels navigating on the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. Therefore, few changes to the regulations
issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, covering vessels entering a U.S. port on the Great Lakes after operating
beyond the EEZ, are required to implement the requirements of the amendments to the Act.

For the period 1986 through 1993, total USDA controlled agricultural export tonnage from the Great Lakes was 1,002,364
metric tons. The total tonnage carried by U.S.-flag vessels was 

270,359 metric tons, or 27 percent. However, little preference cargo has moved on U.S.-flag vessels out of the Great
Lakes since 1989, with the exception of the MORMACSKY trial in 1993, discussed below. At present, the Great Lakes simply
do not have any all-U.S.-flag ocean freight capability for carriage of bulk preference cargo. In contrast, the total
non-liner export nationwide of USDA and AID agricultural assistance program cargo subject to cargo preference in
the 1992&hyph;3 cargo preference year (the latest program year for which figures are available) amounted to 6,297,015
metric tons, of which 4,923,244 mt. or 78.2 percent was transported on U.S.-flag vessels. (Source: Maritime Administration
data base.) 

The disappearance of government-impelled cargo flowing from the Great Lakes coincides with the expiration of the
Great Lakes ``set aside.'' Under the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, codified at 46 App. U.S.C.
1241f(c)(2), a certain minimum amount of government-impelled cargo was required to be allocated to Great 

Lakes ports during calendar years 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. That ``set-aside'' expired in 1989, and was not renewed
by the Congress. 

The 1993 results reflect a unique movement out of the Great Lakes involving a U.S.-flag mother ship and two U.S.-flag
feeder vessels. Two U.S.-flag lake bulk carriers, the J. L. MAUTHE and the AMERICAN MARINER, served as feeders bringing
wheat from a U.S. Great Lakes port to a Canadian transshipment point where the MORMACSKY, a U.S.-flag ocean going vessel,
loaded the cargo destined to Russia. All the vessels were under the control of U.S.-flag carriers. Reportedly, the
demonstration was possible as a result of commodity prices in the Midwest which favored the Great Lakes over other
U.S. ports. However, the MORMACSKY experiment has not been duplicated. The high cost of U.S.-flag feeder carriage
involved in such transshipment would normally allow future transshipment only if foreign-flag vessels brought
the cargo to the Canadian transshipment point and resulted in the lowest landed cost.

BILL OFFERED TO CURB TINY MUSSEL THREATENING GREAT LAKES, RIVERS 




From Times Wire Services 




WASHINGTON 




Members of Congress from Great Lakes states Wednesday introduced legislation to 
curb or eradicate the zebra mussel, a tiny shellfish that has infested Lake 
Erie and threatens to cause damage in other lakes and rivers. 


"The experts seem to think that this can spread very rapidly, just as it has in 
Lake Erie," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the measure, which 
would authorize spending $4 million a year for five years for prevention 
programs and the same amount on eradication. 


The legislation would require freighters to dump their ballast water in the 
ocean at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast. 


The striped zebra mussel, usually no more than 1 1/2 inches long, is believed 
to have arrived in North America in 1986, when a freighter from eastern Europe 
flushed its ballast water into Lake St. Clair or in the St. Clair River near 
Detroit. The mussels have since spread down the length of the Detroit River and 
into Lake Erie, moving at about 160 miles a year. 


Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said that the mussels forced Monroe, Mich., to ration 
water for several days because they had clogged drinking water intake pipes. 


"Over 50 other major municipal intake pipes in Michigan, not to mention 
industry users, are at risk from this same type of fouling," Levin said. "They 
threaten the Great Lakes' $4-billion sports fish industry by robbing the fish 
and other aquatic species of essential food sources such as algae and 
plankton." 


Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) warned that the inedible shellfish can easily migrate 
into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems, which "could become 
literally mussel-bound." 


A female zebra mussel lays up to 40,000 microscopic eggs in a year. 


An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional Research Service 
found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat zebra mussels, but he warned 
that there may not be enough intact wetlands to provide habitat for more of the 
natural predators.

[Docket No. R&hyph;153] 






RIN 2133&hyph;AB13 





Cargo Preference_U.S.-Flag Vessels; Available U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels 






AGENCY:



 Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation. 









ACTION:



 Notice of proposed rulemaking.










SUMMARY:



 This proposed amendment to the cargo preference regulations of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) states that
the requirement for the carriage of preference cargoes on privately-owned ``available'' U.S.-flag commercial
vessels would be satisfied, during a one-season trial period, by U.S.-flag commercial vessels calling at a Canadian
transshipment terminal outside the St. Lawrence Seaway, to load bulk agricultural commodity cargoes subject to
the cargo preference laws that are transshipped from U.S. ports on the Great Lakes by U.S.-flag or foreign-flag vessels;
and determinations of ``fair and reasonable rates for United States commercial vessels'' would include through
bills of lading for such available U.S.-flag commercial vessels. This amendment would allow Great Lakes ports to
compete for agricultural commodity preference cargoes.









DATES:



 Comments on the one-season trial period for this rule must be received on or before May 31, 1994, while comments on a
permanent rule or a rule of greater duration than the one-season trial period must be received July 11, 1994.





















ADDRESSES:



 Send an original and two copies of comments to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, room 7300, 400 7th St., SW.,
Washington DC 20590.













FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



 John E. Graykowski, Deputy Maritime Administrator for Inland Waterways and Great Lakes, Maritime Administration,
Washington, DC, 20590, Telephone (202) 366&hyph;1718. 









SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 United States law requires that at least 50 percent of cargo ``impelled'' by Federal programs (preference cargoes),
and transported by sea, be carried on privately-owned United States-flag commercial vessels, to the extent that
such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates. See sections 901(b) (the ``Cargo Preference Act'') and 901b,
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (``the Act''), 46 App. U.S.C. 1241(b) and 1241f. The Secretary of Transportation
is desirous of administering that program so that all ports and port ranges may participate. As discussed below, to
achieve these objectives, MARAD is proposing to amend its cargo preference regulations to allow Great Lakes ports
to compete for agricultural commodity 

preference cargoes for a one-season trial period, corresponding to 

the Great Lakes shipping season when the St. Lawrence Seaway system is in use. 





For a number of reasons, United States-flag commercial vessels in foreign commerce do not serve the Great Lakes. Consequently,
cargoes subject to cargo preference are not loaded at Great Lakes ports, resulting in significantly less cargo for
these ports in comparison with ports on other United States coasts. MARAD proposes to permit cargoes to be counted
toward the preference requirements if they are loaded at Great Lakes ports for the trip along the St. Lawrence Seaway
and then transferred to United States-flag vessels for the ocean portion of their carriage. The registry (``flag'')
of the vessel loading the cargo on the Great Lakes and carrying it through the Seaway would not be relevant. This rule
would be in effect during a trial period corresponding to the current Great Lakes shipping season. 

MARAD has issued a regulation governing compliance with cargo preference requirements by shipper agencies, which
is published at 46 CFR 381.8. This proposed rule would add a new section 381.9 to MARAD's cargo preference regulations.
It would state that: (1) For a one-season trial period, the requirement for ``available'' U.S.-flag commercial vessels
under the Act would be satisfied by U.S.-flag commercial vessels calling at a Canadian transshipment terminal outside
the St. Lawrence Seaway to carry bulk agricultural commodity cargoes subject to the cargo preference laws, transshipped
from U.S. ports on the Great Lakes by U.S.-flag or foreign-flag vessels; and (2) determinations of ``fair and reasonable
rates for United States commercial vessels'' under section 901(b) would include through bills of lading for such
available U.S.-flag vessels. Such combination foreign/U.S.-flag voyages would not be allowed if, in the future,
all-U.S.-flag carriage, at fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag commercial vessel service, becomes available
to load bulk agricultural commodities at U.S. Great Lakes ports. 

Based on experience during the trial period, and after reviewing comments on this rulemaking, MARAD will consider
whether to make this rule permanent, or extend it for a period of time longer than the one-season trial period. 

The need for this rulemaking arises due to changing shipping conditions affecting U.S.-flag vessels operating in
the Great Lakes, resulting in the absence of all-U.S.-flag vessel availability for the carriage of cargo between
U.S. Great Lakes ports and foreign countries. 

We do not believe that this proposal is precluded by any rulings of the Comptroller General. Specifically, in 1960,
the Comptroller General examined a practice involving shipment of preference cargoes from U.S. Great Lakes ports
to Canadian St. Lawrence River ports on foreign-flag vessels for ``topping off'' U.S.-flag ocean-going vessels
which had partially loaded at U.S. Great Lakes ports. No. B&hyph;140872, 39 Comp. Gen. 758 (1960). The Comptroller
General's opinion found no basis to criticize a regulation of the Department of Agriculture holding that 50 percent
of the cargo



1



 moving between the U.S. Great Lakes ports and Canadian St. Lawrence River ports must move on U.S.-flag vessels. It
should be noted that at that time there was some all-U.S.-flag service to U.S. Great Lakes ports. 











1




The Comptroller General's 1960 decision predated the 75 percent requirement instituted by the Food Security Act
of 1985. 








Dramatic changes in shipping conditions have occurred since 1960, including the disappearance of any all-U.S.-flag
commercial ocean-going service to foreign countries from U.S. Great Lakes ports. The static configuration of the
St. Lawrence Seaway system and the evolving greater size of commercial vessels is one significant shipping change.
In 1960, the average U.S.-flag general cargo vessel had a deadweight tonnage of 10,976; while in 1993, the average
U.S.-flag general cargo vessel had a deadweight tonnage of 17,464.



2



 In addition, the average size of U.S.-flag vessels used for the carriage of bulk agricultural product cargoes has
increased greatly during the past ten years.

in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast
water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has concluded that the proposed regulations would have no negative impact on the environment. The
Coast Guard solicits comments on the potential environmental impact of the proposed regulations.

Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff







October 21, 1994.







Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) tendered
for filing First Revised Sheet No. 4, Original Sheet No. 4A, and Second Revised Sheet No. 6 to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second
Revised Volume No. 1. Great Lakes states these proposed tariff sheets were filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance
with the Commission's January 26, 1994, orders in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;595&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000.



Great Lakes states that the Commission's orders authorized Great Lakes to construct facilities to provide Part 284
blanket transportation service to Rochester Gas and Electronic Company and Sithe/Independence Power Partners,
L.P. Great Lakes explains that the Commission recognized that there would be an additional 12,000 Mcf of capacity
available per day. Great Lakes relates that it conducted an open season which resulted in Mercury Exploration Company
becoming the shipper for that capacity. Great Lakes asserts that the sheets reflect the separately stated incremental
rates set forth in the Commission orders for such services.



Great Lakes requests that the tariff sheets become effective November 1, 1994. Great Lakes relates that construction
was completed earlier than expected, and the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000 will be
able to be placed into service on November 1, 1994, rather than the originally estimated date of January 1, 1995. Great
Lakes states that this filing has been served on all of its customers and the Public Service Commissions of the states
of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.



Any party desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before October 28, 1 994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

NEW MEDFLY INFESTATION FOUND; MORE SPRAYING SET 




By RICHARD SIMON and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 




Even before the first drops of malathion fell over parts of the San Fernando 
Valley on Monday night to fight the county's worst Mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation, officials reported finding more of the crop-destroying pests, 
requiring aerial spraying of a new area of the San Gabriel Valley. 


In the latest infestation -- the county's fifth this year -- spraying was 
ordered for Thursday night over 12 square miles encompassing Rosemead and South 
El Monte, where two Medflies were found over the weekend. 


That brought to 131 the number of Medflies found in the county this year, 
according to officials. They have ordered aerial spraying of a total of 75 
square miles for all five infestations and released more than 100-million 
sterile flies to breed the insect out of existence. 


So far, the unprecedented number of infestations has caused no major problems 
for the state's billion-dollar agricultural industry because the vast majority 
of the state's produce is grown outside the county, a California Farm Bureau 
spokesman said. 


But officials said they are worried about other countries, especially Japan, 
placing California produce under quarantine. 


"It's getting real ticklish," Deputy County Agricultural Commissioner Bob 
Atkins said. "The Japanese are looking very warily at what we're doing." 


"The most serious threat to agriculture is the possibility of foreign 
quarantine," said David Keim, plant protection and quarantine officer for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 


Although a large part of the county is under quarantine -- prohibiting the 
removal of locally grown fruit and vegetables from infested areas -- crops from 
growing areas to the north can be transported through infested areas to the 
downtown Los Angeles produce market in covered trucks or at night when the pest 
is inactive. 


"We're very nervous," the Farm Bureau spokesman said. "Every time we have an 
infestation, it creates the opportunity for the pests to get out into some of 
the agricultural areas of California." 


Asked for comment on the latest find, Susan Trowbridge, a press spokeswoman for 
Gov. George Deukmejian, said, "We never like to see Medflies. We will do all 
that we can as quickly as we can to take care of the problem. The Department of 
Food and Agriculture is monitoring the situation and will take necessary action 
to eliminate the Medflies as soon as possible." 


Medflies lay their eggs in more than 260 varieties of fruits and vegetables, 
rendering the produce unsalable. The pest is established in Hawaii, parts of 
Central and South America, southern Europe and Australia. 


State and federal scientists blame the regions's five infestations on illegally 
smuggled "dirty fruit," -- citrus contaminated with Medfly eggs or larva. 


Scientists say the area's numerous airports, proximity to the Mexican border 
and large immigrant population provide easy entrance for the pest. 


"We feel that the fruit fly problem in L.A. is a people problem. People are the 
source of these infestations," said Roy Cunningham, of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture in Hawaii, one of the nation's leading Medfly entomologists. 


Scientists believe that four of the five infestations are independent finds and 
not the result of natural dispersement. During its lifetime, the Medfly only 
travels several hundred yards from it birthplace, and it is not possible for 
the insect to fly throughout Los Angeles on its own. 


"I suppose its outright smuggling," Keim said, pointing out that inspectors 
have confiscated hundreds of pounds of illegally imported moman, a popular 
fruit in Latin America that is in great demand in Latino neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles. 


Keim said that ports of entry into the United States are "well covered." He 
pointed out that dogs are stationed at airports to sniff for fruits and 
vegetables in the suitcases of arriving passengers. 


"When people come through the regular ports of entry, we feel we are doing a 
pretty good job of picking up fruits and vegetables," he said. 


State officials plan to begin offering a $10,000 reward, donated by the 
agriculture industry, for the conviction of a person "who sneaked in fruit and 
thereby caused an infestation," a state Food and Agriculture spokesman said. 


"This is becoming far too frequent," Los Angeles County Agricultural 
Commissioner Leon Spaugy said. "We have a problem. We have a seeming disregard 
for the quarantines. 


" . . . We always stress the importance of not taking home-grown fruit to Aunt 
May's or someone else's outside the quarantine area," he said. "But we still 
have a number of people who -- either deliberately or through ignorance -- are 
taking fruit outside the area. And there is always the distinct possibility 
that it will start an infestation." 


Battling the infestation costs between $1 million and $2 million in each area, 
he said. 


Two helicopters loaded with malathion lifted off from Van Nuys Airport at 9 
p.m. Monday to begin the valley spraying operation, which was expected to take 
up to six hours to complete. 


In the new area to be sprayed Thursday night, California Conservation Corps 
members will today begin distributing 100,000 flyers to residents advising of 
the spraying. 


The area to be sprayed is bounded by the Pomona Freeway, Garfield and Santa 
Anita avenues and Valley Boulevard. The boundaries could be expanded if a fly 
trapped Monday, just north of the proposed spray zone, is confirmed to be a 
Medfly, authorities said.

   TORONTO


CANADIAN grain exports to Russia have slowed to a trickle because of
Moscow's inability to pay foreign shipowners and a ban imposed by Ottawa on
many Russian-owned vessels to counter an infestation of leaf-eating moths.
Russia's shortage of hard currency has already caused Canadian authorities
to impound at least one fully-laden vessel, and appears to be discouraging
other owners from sending ships to Canadian ports.
The slowdown in shipments to Canada's biggest grain export market has also
caused a domestic transport crisis. About half the grain freighters plying
the Great Lakes are at present idle.
Estimates of June exports were cut yesterday. Total shipments through the
Great Lakes port of Thunder Bay are now projected at 0.5m tonnes, half the
volume expected a month ago.

SCIENTIST SAYS EARLY STATE MEDFLY ATTACK MAY HAVE LOST WAR 




By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Faced with an infestation that won't go away, a leading scientist says the 
government may have made a critical error in its battle against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly this summer by ordering aerial pesticide spraying 
before the true size of the pest population was known. 


Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Medfly expert in Hawaii and 
chairman of the scientific panel advising the current Medfly eradication 
program, said the rapidity with which malathion-bearing helicopters were 
launched may have, ironically, masked the true size of the infestation and 
provided a false sense of confidence that the problem had been solved. 


If the infestation in the Whittier area in October were as large as evidence 
now seems to indicate, the spray might have killed only 90% of the population. 
That still would have left enough of the pests alive to spread, Cunningham 
said. 


"We blinded ourselves with the bait spray," he said. "We must have had a 
sizable population at the start. We did not appreciate that. Maybe in hindsight 
it would have been better to wait and evaluate the situation" before going on 
the attack. 


Orange County has been doused twice with malathion in the last month. The first 
aerial spraying on Nov. 30 followed the discovery of a single pregnant Medfly 
in a guava tree in Brea. On Dec. 6, agricultural officials found three fertile 
Medflies in La Habra Heights, and on Dec. 12, they resprayed a 26-square-mile 
area that included parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 


A Medfly was also trapped on Dec. 8 in Westminster, about 10 miles south of the 
La Habra infestation. But officials decided not to spray Westminster now 
because the trapped fly, while fertile, was not pregnant. Instead, they tripled 
the number of traps to see if more flies appear. 


The experts believe there are several reasons that the pest has been spreading. 
These reasons include people carrying infested fruit out of the Medfly 
quarantine zone. But Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry, said much of 
the spreading infestation in the central Los Angeles area today emerged from 
the Medfly hot spot in the Whittier area, found on Sept. 26. 


That infestation zone was sprayed on Oct. 4, only eight days after the initial 
find. By that time 61 flies had been found. 


"We moved too fast," said Cunningham. He said the original population in 
Whittier must have been very large, but no one will ever know how large because 
of the speed with which treatment was begun. He admitted there is always a 
danger that the infestation will spread while waiting.

MEDFLY STRATEGIES MAY HAVE MASKED PROBLEM 




By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Faced with an infestation that won't go away, the government may have made a 
critical error in its battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly this summer by 
ordering aerial pesticide spraying before the true size of the pest population 
was known, a leading scientist says. 


Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Medfly expert in Hawaii and 
chairman of the scientific panel advising the current Medfly eradication 
program, said the rapidity with which malathion-bearing helicopters were 
launched may have, ironically, masked the true size of the infestation and

said. 


"We blinded ourselves with the bait spray," he said. "We must have had a 
sizable population at the start. We did not appreciate that. Maybe in hindsight 
it would have been better to wait and evaluate the situation" before going on 
the attack. 


The experts believe there are several reasons that the pest has been found in 
such diverse locations as Sylmar and Glendora. These reasons include people 
carrying infested fruit out of the Medfly quarantine zone. But Isi Siddiqui, 
assistant director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture's 
Division of Plant Industry, said much of the spreading infestation in the 
central Los Angeles area today emerged from the Medfly hot spot in the Whittier 
area, found on Sept. 26. 


That infestation zone was sprayed on Oct. 4, only eight days after the initial 
find. By that time 61 flies had been found. 


"We moved too fast," said Cunningham. He said the original population in 
Whittier must have been very large, but no one will ever know how large because 
of the speed with which treatment was begun. He admitted there is always a 
danger that the infestation will spread while waiting, but he said it might be 
better in the future "to take a little time to get a good handle on the 
situation." 


Cunningham said he now believes it might be important in the future to change 
the Medfly battle plan, known as the "protocol," to allow more time to gather 
intelligence before starting to fight the flies with spraying and by releasing 
millions of sterile flies. The theory behind releasing sterile flies is that 
they will breed with the fertile flies, preventing the flies from multiplying. 


Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy in part agreed with 
Cunningham that the protocol needs revision. But in his view, the particular 
mistake this time may have been moving in with sterile flies after only a 
single application of the bait spray. 


"If there is a lesson to be learned, perhaps we ought to evaluate the 
distribution (of flies) very carefully before we rush in with sterile flies," 
he said. "Perhaps we should go with multiple bait sprays before the steriles." 


Siddiqui said that, in Florida, the standard procedure for fighting Medfly 
infestations is to apply four dousings of malathion before bringing in sterile 
flies. The California protocol allows for that as well, but authorities said 
they had been able to knock out infestations in 1987 and 1988 in the Los 
Angeles area with only a single application and, as a result, believed that 
would work again. 


In all, Medfly experts admit the fly's behavior continues to surprise them. The 
lessons they thought they learned seven years ago, during the much-publicized 
Northern California infestation in 1981-82, have not prepared them for what has 
happened this time. 


The frustration of those fighting the crop-destroying pest could be seen Friday 
at a hearing of the state Senate Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources. 
"Something is out of kilter," said Chairman Ruben Ayala (D-Chino). 


Pressed for an explanation of why the infestation has spread so far, Siddiqui 
said, "It's a good question." He ticked off a number of possibilities -- 
infested fruit being mailed in, people carrying fruit out of quarantined areas, 
the arrival of immigrants bearing fruit from infested Central American nations, 
and others -- but finally admitted "there is no pattern" to this outbreak.

MORE MEDFLIES FOUND; SPRAY AREA DOUBLED 




By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 




More fertile Mediterranean fruit flies were reported Tuesday to have been 
detected in the San Gabriel Valley, prompting at last two state scientists to 
express concern that Los Angeles County faces a full-blown infestation of the 
notorious pests. 


The finding of three more of the crop-damaging flies forced agriculture 
officials, who already are battling infestations in five sectors of the county, 
to double the scale of a pesticide spraying operation planned for Thursday and 
to escalate a campaign to persuade the public to honor quarantine boundaries. 


For the first time Tuesday, two members of a five-member state scientific 
panel, which advises farm officials on how to battle the Medfly, broke ranks 
with county and state agriculture officials and their colleagues, saying the 
infestations in Los Angeles County might be linked and demanding a more 
aggressive attack. 


The infestations are "indicative of a larger problem that we have not been able 
to identify," said UC Davis entomologist Richard Rice, one of the two panelists 
calling for stronger action. "Something has gone wrong somewhere, and we need 
to find out why." 


Rice and James R. Carey, also a UC Davis entomologist, said that Los Angeles 
County needs to double the application of pesticides sprayed on infested 
neighborhoods and expand the ongoing program of trapping to better determine 
the extent of the infestation. 


The majority of the panelists and L.A. County officials charged with leading 
the fight, however, maintained a more placid view of the situation. 


The view of County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy and others is that the 
five outbreaks in the last four months are isolated incidents caused by the 
illegal smuggling of fruit. He and other experts said they remain convinced 
that one-time spraying of infested sectors and other tactics are sufficient. 


All participants in the debate are well aware of the Medfly disaster of 1981, 
in which a small infestation in Santa Clara exploded into a statewide outbreak, 
leading to international quarantines, the loss of $100 million to growers and, 
some have suggested, irreparable damage to the political career of then-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. 


Medflies lay their eggs in a wide variety of produce, making it unsaleable. 


While Los Angeles County's once-significant role as an agricultural region has 
diminished, it still serves as a vital hub for the state's most important 
industry. An estimated $1.75 billion in agricultural products that could be 
affected by a Medfly infestation passes through the county each year. 


"I'm not ready to accept that," Spaugy said when asked about the possibility 
that he faces a countywide infestation. If the infestations were part of a 
countywide outbreak, he said, hundreds of flies would show up in the 7,821 
traps hanging from back-yard fruit trees throughout the county. So far, 134 
Medflies have been trapped. 


Three of the trapped flies were discovered late Monday in the San Gabriel 
Valley; the find was announced Tuesday after the fertility of the pests was 
confirmed. 


As a result, the sector to be sprayed with the pesticide malathion Thursday 
night was doubled in size to 23 square miles to include parts of Alhambra, El 
Monte, San Marino, Temple City and all of Rosemead, San Gabriel and South El 
Monte. 


The new spray zone brings to 88 the number of square miles that will have been 
sprayed in Los Angeles County since August. In 1981, a total of 39 square miles 
were sprayed in Los Angeles County. About 230 square miles in the county are 
now under quarantine, which prohibits taking home-grown fruit out of an 
infested area. 


Los Angeles County expects to spend $8 million to $10 million this year "just 
on eradication of the Medfly alone," Spaugy said. The unprecedented number of 
infestations -- five in the county this year -- have affected neighborhoods 
around Elysian Park, the northeast San Fernando Valley, West Covina and 
Whittier. 


Most experts interviewed said that Los Angeles is vulnerable to Medfly 
infestations because of the large amount of cargo and high numbers of people 
traveling through its airports, harbors and train stations. They also pointed 
to the county's large population of immigrants who bring with them fruits from 
infested countries. But no one can say for sure why the problem is so bad this 
year. 


"Why all of a sudden?" asked Bob Atkins, the county's deputy agricultural 
commissioner. "Why don't we see it in different areas in California?" 


The two UC Davis entomologists said the pest may be gaining a foothold in the 
region. 


The numbers "say to me that there is serious problem and that they are at least 
temporarily established," Carey said. "My gut feeling is that if they were 
random infestations, flies would be popping up in other areas. But these are 
all in the L.A. Basin." 


Other regions of the state, such as San Diego, Kern County and the San Joaquin 
Valley, also have large immigrant populations, Carey said. 


He and Rice also disagreed with the suggestion by their colleagues that the 
flies are being spread by people. 


"I can't convince myself that we can't have that much contraband fruit all of 
sudden arriving at the same time," Rice said. 


The latest infestation in Rosemead and El Monte at least has persuaded most 
officials involved in the eradication effort that more needs to be known about 
the root causes. 


"We need to talk about what might be done to determine whether or not there is 
an ongoing, long-existing endemic population," said Derrell Chambers, one of 
the state scientists and director of a federal research facility in Guatemala. 


The expert panel, which is consulted before each aerial malathion spraying, 
will meet with state and county officials in January to devise a scientific 
trapping experiment. 


Also, state and county agriculture officials said they have bolstered 
inspection programs throughout the region, with roving squads of fruit fly 
police that are descending on quarantine areas to check that stores and street 
vendors are protecting clean fruit with plastic covers. 


Last weekend, agricultural officials posted guards at a grocery store in 
Koreatown for two days to stop the sale of fruit. The store, despite repeated 
warnings, continued selling fruit in a quarantine area without installing a 
front door, said Dee Sudduth, senior agricultural biologist for the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture. 


"We had the guards there to keep the customers out of the area," Sudduth said. 
"The customers will just ignore you and grab stuff and run. We had one guy who 
snagged a persimmon and made a dash to the cash register, and they stopped him 
and sent him back." Sudduth said that agricultural officials also destroyed 
1,600 pounds of apples and persimmons at the store. 


There is a $25,000 fine for anyone found guilty of causing a Medfly 
infestation. "But that necessitates building a case, which is difficult to do," 
Spaugy said. 


State officials planned as well to step up their public information program, 
including sending out a mass mailing in English and Spanish to hundreds of 
thousands of residents in infested neighborhoods, urging them to report any 
fruit leaving quarantine areas. "Your cooperation will save millions of tax 
dollars," the notice says. 


County officials hope to take advantage of a new federal law to plug up one of 
the possible "pathways" for the pest. The new law, sponsored by a former 
congressman from the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, allows postal 
authorities to inspect first-class mail coming from such places as Hawaii and 
Puerto Rico, where the Medfly is found. 


At Los Angeles International Airport, federal inspectors fill about "six large 
garbage cans" a day with confiscated fruit detected by specially trained dogs 
and X-ray machines. 


Inspectors question all travelers from foreign countries and Hawaii and conduct 
random baggage searches.

Ballast Water Management for Vessels Entering the Hudson River 






AGENCY:



 Coast Guard, DOT.









ACTION:



 Final rule. 










SUMMARY:



 The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to implement an amendment to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention
and Control Act of 1990 (the Act). The regulations require ballast water management practices for each vessel entering
the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating on waters beyond the Exclusive Economic
Zone. These rules will help to prevent the additional introduction of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species into
the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels operating on the Hudson River.









EFFECTIVE DATE:



 January 30, 1995.




 




ADDRESSES:



 Unless otherwise indicated, documents referred to in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the
office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100
Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 

between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477.









FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



 Lieutenant Jonathan C. Burton, Project Manager, Marine Environmental Protection Division (G&hyph;MEP&hyph;1),
(202) 267&hyph;6714. 






SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 

Drafting Information 





The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Jonathan C. Burton, Project Manager, Marine
Environmental Protection Division, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 





Regulatory History 





On June 21, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Ballast Water Management for
Vessels Entering the Hudson River'' in the 



Federal Register



 (59 FR 31959). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held. 







Background and Purpose 





Historical records suggest that over 100 non-native species have been introduced into the Great Lakes and its tributaries.
The primary medium for their introduction is believed to be ballast water from vessels. Many vessels take on water
in foreign harbors or in the near shore waters which are often rich in living organisms. When these vessels arrive to
take on cargo, they discharge ballast water and any organisms contained in the water enter the 

local ecosystem. While many of these species do not survive in this new environment, those that do quickly adapt, and
in some instances thrive, particularly where there are no natural predators. 

The Zebra Mussel provides a good example of the harmful effects of a newly introduced species. In 1988, this small bivalve
mollusk native to the Black, Azov, and Caspian Seas in the Ukraine and southern Russia, was discovered in the Western
Basin of Lake Erie. Scientists believe that it was introduced in 1986 by the discharge of freshwater ballast of a vessel
from Northern Europe. Hundreds of millions of Zebra Mussels can now be found on and in pipes, screens, conduits, boat
bottoms, floats, buoys, rocks, submerged objects, and native animals and plants. As a filter feeding organism, it
removes vast quantities of microscopic organisms from the water, the same organisms that fish larvae and young fish
rely upon for their food supply. It also completely covers rocks and other substances normally used by native fish
for laying eggs. Since its introduction into the Great Lakes the Zebra Mussel has reproduced and spread throughout
the Great Lakes and its tributaries and has been found as far south as New Orleans.

River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ, has been committed to the Coast Guard
by the Act. Standardizing the minimum requirements for these vessels is necessary to effectively prevent further
introductions of nonindigenous species. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt state and local regulations
that are inconsistent with the requirements of this final rule. These regulations were developed in consultation
with the Task Force which is charged with coordinating among, and providing technical assistance to, regional, State,
and local entities regarding environmentally sound approaches to prevention and control of aquatic nuisance species.






Environment 





No comments were received on the environmental implications of this rule. The Coast Guard considered the environmental
impact of this final rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An
Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available for inspection or copying where indicated
under 



ADDRESSES



. The exchange of ballast water in open ocean will benefit the Hudson River environment and the Great Lakes environment
by helping to prevent potential infestations of nonindigenous species through ballast water emptied into the Hudson
River north of the George Washington Bridge and transferred through the Hudson River and into the Great Lakes. Introduction
of nonindigenous nuisance species through the ballast water of vessels has caused millions of dollars of damage to
date in the Great Lakes area. 

Initial study has concluded that the amount of vessels' seawater-ballast to be discharged into the Hudson River will
constitute such a small volume that no change in the salinity or temperature levels will occur. Species contained
in water collected from the open ocean are unlikely to survive a fresh water environment. Any nuisance species contained
in the ballast water will not therefore, create a new infestation. 

While these regulations will help to prevent potential infestations of species introduced through the ballast water
of vessels, data from the Army Corps of Engineers shows that no vessel traveled north of the George Washington Bridge
in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast
water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has concluded that the regulations will have no negative impact on the environment.

GOVERNORS OF GREAT LAKES STATES SIGN OIL SPILL CLEANUP ACCORD 




By LARRY GREEN, Times Staff Writer 




CHICAGO 




In what they described as a direct reaction to last spring's Alaskan oil spill, 
governors of the eight states bordering the Great Lakes agreed Saturday to 
establish a region-wide plan for cleaning up spills of petroleum products and 
hazardous materials. 


"We are committed . . . to developing an effective plan to both prevent oil 
spills and to provide quick response in the event of such an accident," said 
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, chairman of the Council of Great Lakes 
Governors. 


The agreement was signed as the nation's governors gathered in Chicago for the 
meeting of the National Governors' Assn. 




Form Closed System 


The five Great Lakes hold 20% of the world's fresh water and supply drinking 
water to 30 million Midwesterners. They are a major economic and recreational 
resource and a major route for migratory birds. Unlike oceans, they form a 
closed system unable to flush out hazardous spills. And, unlike the Atlantic 
and Pacific coasts, they are not included in national oil and hazardous 
material spill strategy. 


Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Appelbaum, who met with the governors Saturday, 
said that his agency was already studying a worst-case spill plan for the Great 
Lakes but that the responsibility for any cleanup belongs to private industry. 


An estimated 81 million barrels of refined petroleum products and hazardous 
materials are shipped on the Great Lakes each year in tankers. Additional 
shipments are made on barges. 




Sees Another Threat 


"Stationary sources of potential spills may be a greater threat," said Michigan 
Gov. James J. Blanchard, citing heavy industry, chemical plants and storage 
tanks near the shoreline. 


In the agreement, the governors pledged to establish an emergency spill control 
plan for each state, to maintain a central catalogue of spill-fighting 
equipment and expertise and to try to set up at least one center specifically 
designed to respond to a spill. 


The agreement is the latest in a series of initiatives by Great Lakes 
governors. In 1986 they agreed to ban oil drilling in the lakes and last year 
they set up a fund to fight toxic pollution in the lakes.

   KINGSTON


Hundreds of thousands of infertile screw-worm - a type of fly which has been
devastating cattle and other livestock in the Caribbean - are to be released
from aircraft over Jamaica.
The project is being supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) in an effort to contain the spread of the pest through the region.
The flies being released are the sterile version of the New World
screw-worm, which is attacking cattle in Jamaica and has also been detected
in other parts of the Caribbean - mainly Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and Trinidad and Tobago.
About 86 per cent of the Caribbean region has been found to be infested with
the screw-worm, according to the FAO.
The project involves the continuous release of infertile insects which will
mate but produce no offspring, leading to the progressive reduction and
eventual total collapse of the screw-worm population, the FAO said.
The Caribbean project, to be funded by regional governments as well as the
FAO, is expected to cost about Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m). The Caribbean
islands are hoping for success similar to that achieved in Libya four years
ago, when the introduction of sterile screw-worms eradicated the fly in two
years before it could spread and devastate livestock throughout the
continent.
Sterile flies will be released over all but 10 per cent of Jamaica's 11,424
sq km. The flies are produced in a laboratory on the border between Mexico
and the United States and have been tested in parts of the US, Puerto Rico,
Curacao and the Virgin Islands.
In 1960, the cost of the screw-worm infestation in the United States was
estimated at Dollars 100m a year. Clearing Mexico and the southern United
States of the pest took more than 20 years and cost nearly Dollars 700m.
Regional scientists say that one problem in dealing with the New World
screw-worm is the ease with which it can be spread by animals as well as by
humans. A country can be infested by the presence of the fly in one animal
or human.
Although quarantine regulations reduce the chances of infestation by animals
crossing borders, no such arrangements have been made for humans crossing
from infested areas.
There have been hundreds of documented cases of human infestation by
screw-worm in South America, including some deaths. Caribbean governments
have been advised that a strengthening of quarantine regulations will be
necessary to prevent the spread of the fly, although scientists say it is
also likely that the pest could be spread by wind.

A GREAT deal of natural biological control of insect pests goes on in the
garden quite naturally and without any particular help from the gardener,
except the obvious one of avoiding the use of chemical or other treatments
that might be harmful to the beneficial organisms.
This is now well understood, and the great reduction in the usage of garden
chemicals is partly due to the desire to preserve 'friendly' creatures -
such as ladybird larvae and lacewing flies - that are valuable scavengers in
the garden.
What is not so well known is that some methods of biological control
actually involve deliberately introducing organisms to the garden or
greenhouse.
One of the oldest of these is the white fly parasite, Encarsia formosa, a
tiny wasp which lays its eggs in the white fly scales that are attached to
the leaves of infested plants, sometimes in great numbers. The encarsia eggs
hatch into larvae which devour the scales, so preventing more adult white
flies appearing from them.
This parasite is not a native of Britain and must be artificially introduced
to the greenhouse in which there are white fly infested plants.
This is usually done by hanging up leaves that bear white fly scales already
infested with encarsia and leaving them to develop into adult wasps, which
will then carry on the good work.
In winter, due to lack of warmth and also of white fly scales to keep larvae
fed, this parasite usually dies out and has to be reintroduced the following
year. Of course, a parasite of any kind is dependant on its prey for its own
survival and so can never eliminate a pest altogether but, hopefully, it can
restrict it to tolerable levels.
A second predator that has been used with considerable success to control
the greenhouse red spider mites is called Pytoseiulus persimilis. It is
itself a mite, though of a different kind - one might say one that lives on
meat rather than on vegetables.
Both the adult stage of this mite and the nymph devour adult nymphs and eggs
of the greenhouse red spider mite. Again, if they do it too successfully,
they will automatically destroy themselves since they have no other food
supply.
More recently, a third predator has been added to this list of organisms
that can be used to control pests. This is a minute nematode - what
gardeners often refer to as an eelworm. Some are quite large but this one,
which feeds on the grubs of the vine weevil, is too small to be seen with
the naked eye. Unlike the other two predators this one is native to Britain
but is not present everywhere and most likely will have to be introduced.
The method of introduction is quite different. The nematodes are despatched
in a moist, inert carrier and on arrival are mixed with water and applied as
a drench to the soil that is infested with vine weevil larvae. These
nematodes are as exclusive as encarsia and pytoseiulus in their feeding
habits and present no hazard to any other organism, including human beings
and their pets.
This parasite is marketed as Nemasys by Defender, a company that can supply
other predators and parasites. The address is P0 Box 131, Ashford, Kent TN25
5TQ. Defender is a branch of Biological Pest Control, which supplies growers
throughout the UK and Europe.
Both the adults and the grubs of the vine weevil damage vines and many other
plants. The weevil eats the edges of leaves, giving them an unsightly,
notched appearance, but the damage done by the larvae is much more serious,
though largely unseen. They work underground, gnawing away at roots, and
they attack many other plants beside grape vines.
This pest has been on the increase since the withdrawal of effective soil
insecticides and so the introduction of the parasitic nematode is a real
step forward. It needs a temperature of above 14'C to be fully active. It is
effective outdoors until the end of September and under glass for a much
longer period, even throughout the winter if there is adequate heating.
With most methods of biological control it is advisable to supplement the
treatment with chemical control in certain circumstances.
Thus, with white fly one could use a pyrethrum spray or aerosol to reduce
the number of white flies before introducing encarsia formosa, but there
should be an interval of about seven days before the parasite is introduced.
The adult vine weevils are not directly attacked by the parasitic nematode
but can be reduced in numbers with a spray of gamma HCH or pirimiphos
methyl.
An excellent leaflet on these matters has been prepared by ICI Garden
Products and should be available at most garden shops or direct from ICI,
