   The number of inmates in U.S. prisons jumped by
a record 7.3 percent during the first half of 1989 to a total of
673,565 inmates, the Bureau of Justice Statistics says.
   The six-month increase of 46,004 inmates was higher than any
full-year increase recorded during the 64 years that the government
has counted prisoners, the bureau said Sunday.
   The largest annual increase ever recorded was in 1981-82, when
the national prison population grew by 41,060 inmates, from 344,283
to 385,343, said Tom Hester of the bureau.
   The surge in prison population during the first half of 1989 was
brought about by increases of 7 percent in the number of men
imprisoned and 13 percent in the number of women, the bureau said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the increase was ``an
indication that more criminals, many convicted of drug-related
offenses, are being caught and punished.''
   ``The criminal justice system is working,'' Thornburgh said in a
statement. ``People who break the law do pay the price.''
   The figures dramatize the need for almost 1,800 new prison beds a
week, the bureau said. ``Congress needs to act swiftly on President
Bush's violent crime legislation, which provides for the
construction of more than 24,000 new federal prison beds,''
Thornburgh said.
   The national drug control strategy, announced by Bush last
Tuesday, echoed the crime legislation Bush called for in May in
seeking $1.2 billion in 1990 budget authorization for additional
federal prison space.
   Most of the increase from Dec. 31, 1988, to June 30, 1989,
occurred in the state prison systems, where the population grew by
41,214 or 7.1 percent, from 577,633 at the end of 1988 to 618,847 at
the end of June. During the same period, the federal prison
population expanded by 4,790, a 9.7 percent increase from 49,928 to
54,718.
   During the six-month period, nine jurisdictions reported
double-digit growth in their inmate populations: Rhode Island, 20.3
percent; South Dakota, 19.9 percent; Connecticut, 18.4 percent;
Utah, 13.2 percent; the District of Columbia, 12.1 percent; Idaho,
11.3 percent; Mississippi, 10.6 percent; Missouri, 10.4 percent; and
Kentucky, 10.2 percent.
   Two states experienced declines in prison populations _
Tennessee, down 2.3 percent, and North Dakota, down 2.1 percent. And
Texas had such a small increase, only 2 prisoners more, that the
change was listed as 0 percent.
   Since 1980, the number of state and federal prisoners serving
sentences of more than one year _ known as sentenced prisoners _
more than doubled, from 315,974, while four states recorded a
tripling of such inmates _ California, New Hampshire, Alaska and New
Jersey.
   An additional 25 states and the District of Columbia doubled
their prison populations.
   Overall, the number of sentenced prisoners as of June 30 was 260
per 100,000 population, with 18 of them in federal prisons and 242
in state institutions. On Dec. 31, 1980, there were 139 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 population, the bureau said.

<HL> REGIONS:
Multistate Lottery's Prospects
Grow, Even Absent Big States
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. 
So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of your potential customers are playing the multimillion-dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. 

   That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do. 
Starting early next year, Iowa and Missouri plan to join forces with several other states in a coast-to-coast, multistate lottery. 

   The idea is to promote the same lottery"America's Game" is one of the names being considered -- in states from Oregon to Rhode Island. 
The states would be linked by satellite every Saturday night for the weekly drawing. 

   The new game is likely to hurt ticket sales in participating states' existing lotteries. 
But organizers of the multistate game are betting that the public's usual response to lotteries will prevail. 
That is, a large population base will produce lots of ticket sales, which will build big jackpots, which will inspire even more sales, far outweighing any revenue loss in single-state games. 
As usual in the lottery business, the odds of winning will be infinitesimal. 

   THE BIG QUESTION is membership. 
Six states, with a combined population of 16 million, already are committed to the plan: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia. 
The District of Columbia says it's in, too. 
If past experience is any guide, that should make the multistate lottery one of the nation's richest games of chance. 

   It would be richer still if New York and Illinois, both early supporters of the multistate idea, weren't sitting on the sidelines. 
Illinois Gov. James Thompson is stringing out a decision whether to participate. 
New York's lottery director, John Quinn, says his state won't play unless Illinois does. (New York's legislature needs to approve the state's multistate membership; a bill to that effect apparently died last month when the assembly recessed.) 

   Signing up the two big states would triple the multistate lottery's projected population base to 45 million. 
The small states think this is wonderful, because residents of Iowa or West Virginia would have a shot -- albeit tiny -- at a huge grand prize in a homestate lottery. 
Ticket sales in those states would presumably soar. 

   THE RATIONALE BEHIND LOTTERIES, after all, is to raise money for state government programs and thus ease the bite on taxpayers. 
Oregon's lottery, just two years old, has already earned $70 million for state economic development programs ranging from new university buildings to commercial fishing piers. 
In Illinois, 42% of lottery income goes to elementary and secondary schools. 
Last year, that came to $553 million. 

   Indeed, Illinois, with its own popular lottery, has less incentive than the smaller states to join the multistate lottery. 
It was Illinois, after all, that produced the richest prize won by a single ticketholder in a North American lottery: $40 million in September 1984. 
The huge pot came after the lottery went four weeks without a winner, the grand prize rolling over and growing each week. 

   "During those four weeks, we had tremendous ticket sales," recalls Michael Jones, Illinois's lottery superintendent at the time and now a Chicago-based lottery consultant. 

   It's what lottery directors dream about: a game designed in such a way that every so often, no one wins the grand prize for two or three weeks in a row. 
The prize money builds, newspapers and television give the game big coverage, and people line up everywhere to buy tickets in a sort of gambler's feeding frenzy. 

   But Illinois's grand prize hasn't come close to that level since , leading the state's lottery strategists to wonder how to boost business. 
One way is to join the multistate game. 
Rebecca Paul, who resigned as Illinois's lottery director last week to head Florida's new lottery, thinks that's the wave of the future. 
In Canada, Australia, Switzerland and West Germany, multistate or multiprovince lotteries are the most widely played. 
"I think that's where we're headed three to five years from now," Ms. Paul says. 

   MR. JONES FORESEES a different format. 
"I see the large states getting together in a super lotto." 
He suggests a "triangle game" with Florida, New York and Illinois, or a Great Lakes regional lottery, with Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. 
There is a precedent: Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont already run a lottery called Tristate Megabucks. 

   Ms. Paul, whose Florida game will begin Jan. 15, doesn't like the idea of such fragmented lotteries. 
"I think it's bad for the industry to have competing multistate games," she says. 

   Multistate games aren't the only way to draw more players; states can also change the odds on an existing game. 
Illinois did that in April, introducing a new Wednesday night lotto drawing that makes it easier to win a cheap prize (last week it was one chance in 89 to win $12 on a $1 ticket), but tougher to win the grand prize (one chance in 15.4 million). 
The idea paid off late last month, when the jackpot reached $22 million, Illinois's highest in three years. 

   As for the multistate plan, Sharon Sharp, who took over yesterday as Illinois lottery director, says she hasn't made up her mind about Illinois membership. 
If the answer is yes, Chicago will be the site of the weekly multistate lottery drawing. 
If Illinois says no, the winning numbers will be picked in Des Moines, Iowa.

   Racial Groups Diverge
   In Timing of First Births
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are
widening, two University of Pennsylvania demographers find.
   Drawing on birth and other records published since 1979,
Renbao Chen and S. Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to
1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earlier
trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women
over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births
than over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to
catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,
Asians and others -- also tended to have their first children
at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.
   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other
nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth
than were white women of the same age. For example, in 1987 a
20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have
her first child in the following year as was a 20-year-old
white woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 1
1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her
white counterpart.
   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have far
lower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,
blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and other
involuntary factors. This situation started reversing in the
1950s, and the difference has grown greater as more white
women have forgone having children altogether. In 1987, for
instance, a white woman born in 1954 was better than three
times more likely to be childless than a 33-year-old
nonwhite.
                                                                                                       

   Farm Belt Holds Onto
   Its Oldest Americans
                                                                                                       

   THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the Farm
Belt, 1990 census figures show.
   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men and
women are found in the most populous states: New York,
California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
Michigan. In each of these, people 85 and over total well
into six figures.
   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,
however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the
85-and-older group accounts for 1.5% or more of the total
population. Iowa leads with 2.0%, closely followed by South
Dakota and Nebraska with 1.9%, North Dakota with 1.8% and
Kansas with 1.7%.
   In nine other states, including Arkansas, Missouri,
Minnesota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, the oldest old account for
1.6% or 1.5% of the total. The other states in this category
are East Coast: Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and
Maine. Alaska, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,
with only 0.2% of its population 85 or older.
   Much the same states rank at or near the top in the
percentage of total state population living in nursing homes.
The Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Montana and Rhode Island are the only states with
at least 1% of their populations living in nursing homes.
Census Bureau specialist Cynthia Taeuber says most nursing
home residents are 85 or older.
   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in these
states? Ms. Taeuber hypothesizes that in most of these states
younger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,
while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitably
constituting a larger share of the total. And with their
children moved away, many end up in nursing homes.
   Another census report says that the number of
centenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubled
between 1980 and 1990, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated
14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in 1980.) More
than 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 of
the total were white.
                                                                                                       

   Golf Has More Players,
   Who Play More Often
                                                                                                       

   MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing more
often, a recreation specialist reports.
   Rod Warnick, a University of Massachusetts professor who
tracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adult
golfers increased about 6% a year in the 1980s to 22.2
million, while the number of days played grew about 7%
annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of
"heavy" golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, grew
even faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while the
number of days these avid golfers played increased about 8%
annually to almost 300 million days.
   Mr. Warnick says the growth of leisure time, the
increasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the baby
boomers all contributed. He also finds that more women and
minorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as apt
to lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golf
clubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given to
equal treatment.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOBILE HOMES make up 7% of the nation's housing inventory,
the Census Bureau reports. This is the fastest-growing type
of housing, up 60% since 1980. . . . Athletes who play hard
to win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play for
fun, University of Florida researchers find. They say those
who take a game too much to heart are more likely to put
themselves in a risky situation in an effort to come out
ahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women
65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under a contract with the
government's National Institute on Aging. About two-thirds of
all disabled older people are female.

<HL> Justices Decide States Can Deny Benefits
To Women Leaving Jobs for Pregnancy

   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that federal law permits states to deny unemployment compensation to women who give up their jobs because of pregnancy. 

   The high court upheld a Missouri law that denies unemployment benefits to all employees who leave work for reasons that aren't caused by the job itself. 
Under Missouri law, for example, layoffs or illness caused by a job would be considered work-related; pregnancy isn't viewed as a job-related reason for leaving. 

   By an 8-0 vote, the high court ruled that a federal law passed in 1976 says pregnant women can't be singled out for less-favorable treatment than other workers who seek jobless benefits. 
The law doesn't say pregnant women must be treated better, the court said in an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor. 

   Estimates of the number of states with laws similar to Missouri's vary. 
The Supreme Court mentioned Oklahoma and Vermont, while the lawyer for the woman challenging the Missouri law listed Vermont, Minnesota, North Dakota and the District of Columbia. 

   The ruling involves different federal and state laws from last week's 6-3 decision that states may require employers to give disability leave and to guarantee job reinstatement to pregnant women. 

   Last week's ruling said that federal civil rights law didn't bar the states from requiring that pregnant women be given disability leave, while the decision yesterday involves the federal unemployment law and whether it requires states to provide jobless benefits to pregnant women who leave work. 
The court yesterday made no mention at all of the decision last week. 

   Last week, the justices went out of their way to say that the California law didn't really require preferential treatment for women; the law simply made women equal in the work place. 
In yesterday's ruling, however, the court said that interpreting federal law to require unemployment benefits for pregnant women would discriminate against other unemployed persons for whom benefits aren't required. 

   The lawsuit was filed by Linda Wimberly, a J.C. Penney Co. cashier who took a leave of absence to have a baby in 1980. 
Missouri law doesn't require reinstatement, and when she wanted to return to work one month after her baby was born, the company said there was no job available. 
Her unemployment claim was rejected by the state, and the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the denial of benefits. 

   The high court's ruling upheld the Reagan administration's interpretation of the federal law. 

   Justice Harry Blackmun didn't participate in the case and gave no explanation. 

   Water-Pollution Suits
   The justices ruled 9-0 that a company that is located in one state and pollutes interstate waters can be sued in the courts of another state affected by the pollution. 
But the lawsuit must be decided based on the laws of the state from which the pollution came, rather than based on the affected state's law, the court said in a 5-4 vote. 

   The opinion written by Justice Lewis Powell said that applying one state's pollution laws to a polluting company in another state would interfere with federal water-pollution standards and enforcement. 

   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Vermont and some of its residents in state court in Vermont. 
The suit alleged that an International Paper Co. mill on the New York side of Lake Champlain was discharging waste into the lake, polluting interstate waters. 

   The Supreme Court rejected the company's argument that only federal law should apply to the case, and rejected the state's claim that Vermont law should apply. 
As a result of the ruling, Vermont may continue the lawsuit, but New York law will govern the case. 

   Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens agreed that some state lawsuits are allowed under the federal law, but disagreed that New York law must be applied. 

   Annexing Voting Areas
   The justices ruled 6-3 that a city's refusal to annex a largely black neighborhood when it does annex a white neighborhood may violate the federal voting rights law. 
The court upheld a federal court's refusal to approve a proposed annexation by the city of Pleasant Grove, Ala. 
The Justice Department had also refused to approve the city's plan. 

   The voting rights law requires some cities and states to obtain the department's approval before making any changes that affect voting rights. 
The city argued that proposed annexations during the 1970s of a white area and an unoccupied area that the city intended for white housing didn't change voting rights of minorities because the city had an all-white population at the time. 

   But the Supreme Court, giving broad meaning to the law, said the annexations of white areas could be seen as an effort to minimize the likely impact of future black voters, which is "as impermissible a purpose as the dilution of present black voting strength." 

   Justices Powell, O'Connor and Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented.

<HEAD>Half of All Americans Live in 37 Metro Areas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two centuries after the United States was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119
million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.
   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater New York metro area while
the southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.
   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recent
years, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patterns
between 1980 and 1987.
   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the
1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
Midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in
much of the interior of the United States, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.
Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
July 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5
million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;
Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1
million; Dallas, 3.7 million;
   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9
million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,
2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;
Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;
   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9
million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,
1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;
Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;
   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;
Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;
Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,
R.I., 1.1 million; Charlotte, N.C., 1.1 million; Hartford, Conn.,
1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.

   They're nuts about white squirrels in
Marionville. Just ask the folks at the White Squirrel Furniture
Store, the White Squirrel Car Wash or the White Squirrel Hollow Bed
&amp; Breakfast.
   And watch where you're driving: A 21-year-old city ordinance
imposes a $500 fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of the
rare albino squirrels. Motorists must yield right of way to them.
   No one has ever been arrested for violating the law, but that
doesn't mean it's taken lightly.
   ``If I catch somebody killing a white squirrel, I will issue a
citation,'' said Police Chief Jesse Merritt, who wears a
squirrel-emblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform. ``It's no joke.''
   Some people even go so far as to trap the albinos' gray cousins
and banish them from the small southwest Missouri town to give the
white squirrels first crack at the nuts.
   Marionville, home to 2,000 people and nearly half that many white
squirrels, has a billboard welcoming visitors to the ``Home of the
White Squirrel.''
   Only one other community in the nation _ Olney, Ill. _ is known
to have a sizable concentration of the snow-white squirrels, but
Marionville's colony is much larger, says James Smart, a local
authority and booster of the animal.
   ``We've blown Olney off the map,'' he boasts. Olney has a measly
few dozen squirrels, he figures.
   Wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size of
Marionville's is rare.
   ``Normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a population
such as squirrels or birds or deer, but entire populations are not
something you come across all that frequently,'' said Eric
Kurzejeski, a state wildlife research biologist.
   Signs of Marionville's affection for the white squirrel, which
mates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin, are
everywhere.
   The Lions Club sells white squirrel T-shirts and pins to raise
money to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for the
squirrels. More than 500 dens have been put up, and volunteers have
planted hundreds of nut trees.
   ``We've had orders for T-shirts from Kalamazoo, Mich., to Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Memphis, Kentucky,'' says Smart, a Lions
member. ``Marionville is a small town, but people who grew up here
and moved away still remember their roots and want to help the white
squirrel.''
   White squirrels first appeared in Marionville around 1860, Smart
says. According to local legend, a couple of the critters escaped
from a traveling circus and began multiplying, or were the product
of a weird experiment by a local scientist.
   Smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up on
the deck of his home about 12 years ago. He set out to increase the
population by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woods
around his home and releasing them several miles away to provide
more room for the whites.
   ``We trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half,'' he said.
``It was just amazing what the whites did then.''
   Smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in
30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property.
   ``I have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it,'' he
said.
   Retirees Johnie and Ann Clark spend hours on their back porch
watching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at their
feeders. The couple had no white squirrels until Smart transplanted
some there a few years ago.
   ``They'll play just like a little kitten,'' Mrs. Clark said.
``There will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eat
and I'll say, `Don't leave, Johnie's bringing you something.' I
swear they can understand me.''
   Diana Wise, who runs the White Squirrel Hollow Bed &amp; Breakfast
with her husband, Clint, says people come for miles to see the
animals.
   ``A lot of people don't really believe we have white squirrels
because they stop at noon and don't see them,'' she said. ``The best
time to see them is 6:30 or 7 in the morning and around 7, 7:30 at
night when they're feeding. They don't like the heat and I think the
light hurts their pink eyes.''
   Smart used to hunt gray squirrels (``Young squirrel, fried, with
biscuits and gravy _ you can't beat it''), but not anymore.
   ``The squirrels are a hobby, a challenge for me now,'' he says.
``I guess I'm paying back for all the hunting I used to do.''

   As President Reagan follows Vice President
George Bush into Missouri, he is taking his campaign for the
Republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in 1980 and
resoundingly four years ago.
   Reagan was flying today to Cape Girardeau, a shipping center on
the Mississippi River, for a rally at Southeast Missouri State
University, and then on to St. Louis to address 1,000 guests at a
$250-a-plate fund-raising dinner.
   ``The general thrust of both of these speeches is support for
the Republican ticket, acknowledgement of the economic successes of
this administration, discussion of the differences between liberals
and conservatives,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Tuesday.
   ``The first rally speech may focus a little more on the economy
and the second one a little more on military strength,'' the
spokesman said. ``But they will both be traditional political
speeches, covering the themes that the president has discussed in
the past.''
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the Nov. 8 election.
   GOP candidates who will benefit from the Missouri events include
Gov. John Ashcroft, seeking a second term against Democratic State
Rep. Betty Hearnes of Charleston, the wife of former Gov. Warren
Hearnes; and Sen. John Danforth, opposed by State Sen. Jay Nixon of
Hillsboro as he seeks his third term.
   Both Ashcroft and Danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   Bush, speaking Tuesday in Jefferson City, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, Carter and Mondale, and who knows who else.''
   Reagan took Missouri's 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the
popular vote against then-President Carter in 1980 and swept the
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against Walter Mondale in
1984.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit Cape
Girardeau previously was William Howard Taft on Oct. 26, 1902.
Reagan will speak at the year-old Show Me Center.
   In St. Louis, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than 2 million, the president will speak at
the Omni Hotel St. Louis at an event for the Missouri GOP Victory
'88 fund.

   Americans elect a new president and vice president this year
along with a dozen state governors, 33 U.S. senators and all 435
members of the next U.S. House of Representatives.
   Election Day is Nov. 8. The Census Bureau estimated the nation's
voting-age population _ people aged 18 or over _ will be 182.6
million, about 8.1 million more than in 1984 when 92,654,861
actually voted for president.
   This year's election is for the four-year presidential and vice
presidential terms starting next Jan. 20, when Republican Ronald W.
Reagan will retire after eight years in the White House.
   Here's the 1988 election situation for top federal and state
offices:

   Vying for votes in the 50 states and the District of Columbia
are:
   _Republicans George Bush for president and Dan Quayle for vice
president. Bush, vice president under Reagan, and Quayle, a U.S.
senator from Indiana, were nominated at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans. The last incumbent vice president to be
elected president was Martin Van Buren, a Democrat, who won in 1836.
   _Democrats Michael Dukakis for president and Lloyd Bentsen for
vice president. Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, and Bentsen, a
U.S. senator from Texas, were nominated at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. The last sitting governor to be elected
president was Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York in 1932.
   Among various other presidential candidates on the ballots are
the New Alliance Party's Lenora B. Fulani of New York, a
psychologist, joined in most states by the Libertarian Party's
Ronald E. Paul, a former congressman from Texas, and in some states
by the Consumer Party's Eugene J. McCarthy, a former U.S. senator
from Minnesota.

Democrats and 23 Republicans.
   Of the 12 governors to be elected, nine will win four-year terms
and three _ in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont _ two-year
terms.
   By law, Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana, a Republican, serving a
second consecutive term, could not seek re-election.
   Two other governors, Theodore Schwinden of Montana, a Democrat,
and John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, chose to retire
from office rather than seek re-election.

   The 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives for the 101st
Congress is being elected this year. Members will serve during the
first half of the new president's administration.
   Under the Constitution, every state is entitled to one House
seat; beyond that, representatives are apportioned among the states
according to population, with figures determined on the basis of
every 10-year census.
   The term of office is two years, starting Jan. 3, 1989.
   To hold a majority, one party must win at least 218 seats.
Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress.
   Present occupants of the House's 435 seats include 255 Democrats
and 177 Republicans, with three seats vacant.
   Here are the vacancies, and those who had held the seats: New
Jersey's 3rd District, Democrat James J. Howard, who died March 25;
Tennessee's 2nd District, Republican John J. Duncan, who died June
21; and New York's 19th District, Democrat Mario Biaggi, who
resigned Aug. 5.
   Representatives must be elected; House vacancies cannot be
filled by appointment.
   In all, 27 House seats are open _ three are vacant, one
incumbent lost in a primary, 12 representatives are retiring at the
end of this term, seven congressmen are nominees for Senate seats,
three gave up their House seats and unsuccessfully sought
nomination for the Senate, and one congressman is a gubernatorial
nominee.
   The remaining 408 representatives campaigned for re-election.

<HEAD>The Electoral College</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Because the nation uses an Electoral College system, voters
don't directly elect the president and vice president. Instead,
Americans cast ballots for electors, apportioned among the states
and the District of Columbia.
   In this election, 538 electoral votes will be at stake in 50
states and the District of Columbia, with at least 270 electoral
votes needed to win. Electors will meet in the states and District
of Columbia on Dec. 17. Their votes will be counted Jan. 6 by a
joint session of Congress.
   Reagan won the 1984 presidential election with 54.45 million
popular votes and 525 electoral votes, beating Democrat Walter F.
Mondale who received 37.57 million popular votes and 13 electoral
votes. Reagan carried 49 states in 1984 while Mondale carried
Minnesota and the District of Columbia.
   Here's the distribution of electoral votes at stake this year:
   _47 for California.

   An increase in drug-related arrests and
stricter sentencing requirements have brought about a 7.4 percent
hike in the number of inmates in federal and state prisons, but
prison capacity hasn't kept up, according to the Justice Department.
   At the end of 1988, a record 627,402 men and women were
incarcerated nationwide, but the most optimistic estimate of prison
capacity said there was room for 566,898. While the prison
population was increasing by 7.4 percent, the prison capacity was
increasing by just 5.5 percent.
   ``The 1988 increase translates into a nationwide need for more
than 800 new prison bed spaces per week,'' said the report written
by Lawrence A. Greenfeld, corrections unit chief for the
department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   The FBI, meanwhile, announced that serious crimes nationwide
rose 3 percent between 1987 and 1988. The total number of violent
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies increased 5 percent,
paced by a 7 percent jump in aggravated assaults in the last year,
according to preliminary results of the 1988 Uniform Crime Report.
   The report said motor vehicle thefts increased 11 percent from
last year.
   The 1988 crime index increased 4 percent in the Northeast and
South but registered no change in the Midwest. The index _ the
total number of crimes reported to state and local authorities _
increased 3 percent in the West.
   The report released Sunday said the 42,967 additional prisoners
in 1988 were about 3,500 more than the number added during 1987.
There had been a 7.2 percent hike in 1987 over the previous year.
   The report attributed the increases both to the heightened
likelihood that a serious offender will receive a prison sentence
and a 113 percent increase in the number of adults arrested for
drug trafficking or manufacturing.
   And the Bureau of Prisons expects the increases to continue.
   ``Obviously, the increased efforts of law enforcement to combat
drug problems (will hike the population), as well as the new
sentencing guidelines under which inmates will be serving longer
sentences,'' said Greg Bogdan.
   The federal prison population, which stood at 49,928 at the end
of 1988, a 3.4 percent increase over the 48,300 at the end of 1987,
is expected to reach some 83,500 by 1995, Bogdan said.
   The report said that nationwide, state prisons were operating at
7 percent to 23 percent over capacity, while federal prisons were
estimated to be between 33 percent and 72 percent over capacity.
Bogdan said the federal prisons were operating at an average of 55
percent over capacity.
   During 1988, total state and federal prison capacities increased
by 28,000 to 31,000 beds, depending on how the various
jurisdictions rated capacities, the report found.
   The report, which calculated prison population based both on all
prisoners and on those sentenced to more than one year, called
``sentenced prisoners,'' found that since 1980, the District of
Columbia and the federal prison system have more than doubled the
number of sentenced prisoners.
   Alaska, California, New Hampshire and New Jersey have
experienced a threefold increase since 1980, when total prison
populations in those states were 29,725, to 1988 totals of 93,597.
   The states that have more than doubled the number of such
prisoners since 1980 were Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah.
   The incarceration rate, based on the number of people sentenced
to more than one year in prison, reached 244 per 100,000 residents
nationwide. In 1980, the rate was 139 per 100,000.
   The Western states had the highest increase in total prisoners,
11.5 percent, while the Northeast had a 9.2 percent increase, the
Midwest 8.6 percent, and the South 4.7 percent.
   The 10 states with the biggest percentage increase in total
prison population from 1987 to 1988 were Rhode Island, 33.5
percent; Colorado, 24.7 percent; New Hampshire, 17.5 percent,
Michigan, 16.1 percent; California, 13.7 percent; Arizona, 11.1
percent; Missouri, 10.8 percent; Kentucky, 10.6 percent; Nevada,
10.1 percent, and Minnesota, 9.9 percent.
   But the prison population actually declined in seven states, the
report found. The states with declines were South Dakota, down by
10 percent; Washington, down 5.1 percent; Maine, down 2.3 percent;
Tennessee and Alabama, down 1.7 percent; North Carolina, down 0.9
percent, and West Virginia, down 0.2 percent.
   Although men in prison still vastly outnumber the women
incarcerated, the number of women inmates increased at a faster
rate during 1988, 12.5 percent, than the men, 7.1 percent. The
number of women in state and federal prisons grew from 29,064 at
the end of 1987 to 32,691 at the end of 1988, while the number of
men in prison increased from 555,371 to 594,711.

Plan for a County's Survival:
First, Eliminate Some Towns
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
09/15/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
   IMAGINE A LOCAL ELECTION where you are given the choice of dissolving your hometown. 
Wiping it clean off the map. 
A lot of voters in St. Louis County, Mo., may face that decision next spring as part of an unusual experiment in government reorganization. 

   The audacious plan is being championed by St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary. 
For starters, he suggests completely redrawing the boundaries within St. Louis County, creating 21 municipalities where 90 exist now. 
Mr. McNary says streamlining the county's crazy-quilt geography, along with rejiggering the tax system, would bring efficiency to local government and improve the area's business climate. 

   It would also put a stop to a phenomenon that is making life miserable for Mr. McNary and a lot of other officials of counties in fast-growing metropolitan areas of the U.S. 
This is the push by communities to gobble up valuable, tax-producing land through annexation or outright incorporation. 

   WHEN A CITY or a town reaches beyond its boundaries and snaps up a shopping center or an affluent housing development on county land, it improves its own tax base. 
The county, meanwhile, loses a chunk of real estate that was generating revenue for its own treasury. 

   The trend is strictly one-way. 
Mr. McNary and other metropolitan county executives seem powerless to stem the land grabs. 
They foresee a situation not many years hence when communities will have skimmed off all the valuable real estate, leaving counties in possession of a handful of isolated, unattractive parcels. 

   What to do? 
Mr. McNary's plan at first glance looks like surrender. 
He proposes incorporating all of St. Louis County, wrapping every last chunk of county land into one or another community's boundaries. 
The county budget would be cut in half; it would turn over police and fire duties to the communities and worry only about regional matters, such as roads and economic development. 

   St. Louis County, 524 square miles and one million population, nestles between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and the western limits of the city of St. Louis. 
It is largely developed, with a mix of wealthy and low-income neighborhoods, factories and parkland. 
About 40% of the county's land is inside some municipality's boundaries. 
The rest of the area, most of it on the county's periphery at the farthest distance from downtown St. Louis, is unincorporated. 

   IT'S THE PROLIFERATION of cities and towns in the county that grates Mr. McNary's sense of government efficiency. 
The 90 municipalities range from a robust community of over 50,000 population to glorified neighborhoods with fewer than 100 residents. 
That's the second-highest number of cities and towns of any county in the U.S., the county says; only Allegheny County, Pa., which includes Pittsburgh and environs, has more. 

   Mr. McNary totes up the numbers. 
"There are 530 elected officials, 43 fire departments and 70 police departments. 
There's something like 700 different taxing rates. 
It's ludicrous for people to be paying for that kind of inefficiency." 

   Continued piecemeal zoning and incorporation will leave the county in dire straits, the executive says. 
"We'll have 130 or 150 municipalities, and any time a company wants to come in, there'll be a neighborhood zoning board to make them dance through the hoops. 
That's not conducive to economic vitality. 

   Mr. McNary and his planning staff have produced a blueprint that radically alters this patchwork pattern. 
It shows 21 communities, nearly all with populations in the 25,000 to 75,000 range. 
That's large enough to provide a broad range of city services but not so big that citizens can't be heard. 

   The new cities would absorb smaller units and get some county land on the side. 
For example, the revamped city of Normandy would digest all or part of 26 municipalities. 

   THE VOTING PROCEDURE is complex. 
A signature-gathering campaign has assured county reorganization a place on the ballot. 
The actual plan will be drafted by a 15-member Board of Freeholders, a peculiar institution created by Missouri's constitution to arbitrate conflict between the city and county of St. Louis. 
It could be Mr. McNary's blueprint, or one substantially different. 

   Oddly, the freeholder procedure for county reorganization also requires approval by city of St. Louis voters. 
Mr. McNary says city officials have pledged not to sabotage reorganization, despite a nasty disagreement over the location of a new professional football stadium that is taking on the character of a blood feud. 

   Selling reorganization, particularly to county residents and elected officials of towns destined to disappear, won't be easy. 
"The strategy is to preserve the large municipalities and give them some of the unincorporated land they've been trying to annex anyway," says Mr. McNary. 
And the small communities? 
"They're proud of their independence, but with the loss of (federal) revenue sharing, they're about to go under anyway." 

   The county executive is reconciled to howls of pain. 
"The very small municipalities will get 50% of the ink and make 50% of the noise on radio and television," he says. 
But their numbers at the ballot box aren't large. 
The 25 smallest communities make up only 1% of the county electorate. 
"We hope they'll be reasonable about finding a solution," Mr. McNary says, without much conviction.

   The Department of Transportation says the
government chose a ``reasonable'' route to transport damaged fuel
from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to Idaho, despite concerns
that the cargo crosses too many urban areas.
   The DOT said in a 47-page report this week that the Energy
Department made ``a reasonable choice when evaluated against the
multiple objective route selection criteria.''
   However, the report also said, ``During the course of planning
the shipping campaign, the Energy Department did not have
well-developed operational guidelines for route selection.''
   Population exposure was not a significant factor in picking the
route, the report said.
   The Energy Department is 3{ years into a program to haul 300,000
pounds of damaged, radioactive fuel by train from the crippled TMI
Unit 2 reactor in Middletown, Pa., to an Idaho laboratory 2,400
miles away.
   Along the way, the fuel passes through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming. At the lab, the
material is analyzed by EG&amp;G Idaho, an Energy Department contractor
hoping to learn more about the 1979 TMI incident, the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident.
   Twenty trips, each taking about five days, have been completed
by the Conrail and Union Pacific railroads. There are expected to
be two more, TMI spokeswoman Mary Wells said Thursday.
   The report noted that the Energy Department ``encountered
opposition to the route, which passes through several large cities
(Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Kansas City). Most
concerns were from the St. Louis area, and to a lesser extent,
Pittsburgh areas and by the states of Kansas and Illinois.''
   The fuel, along with metal debris, is contained in canisters
secured inside layered stainless steel and lead casks designed to
withstand accidents.
   Because of its confidence in the casks, the Energy Department
did not use population exposure as a major determining factor in
choosing the route, DOT said.
   ``Since the best quality track is usually found on lines
connecting and traversing large population centers, the Energy
Department is generally forced to choose between using higher
quality track and avoiding high population areas,'' the report said.
   The DOT study was prompted by a request from Sen. John Danforth,
D-Mo., for an independent assessment of the route.
   While it found the safety risks acceptable, DOT said the public,
``influenced by the nature of the material, apparently perceives a
risk higher than that based on technical considerations.''
   However, DOT also said that Energy Department poorly documented
its route selection decisions and lacked proper guidelines.
   The Energy Department said in a news release that ``this lack of
documentation does not indicate non-compliance with regulations or
breach of public safety.''
   The shipments are part of the overall $1 billion cleanup of the
TMI reactor.

Alaska Learns What It's Like
To Register a Population Loss

   ADD ALASKA to the short list of states losing population. 
The reason: a sharp increase in the number of residents moving out. 
In the early 1980s, a healthy influx of newcomers, plus the highest natural population increase of any state (about six babies are born in Alaska for every person that dies), kept population moving up briskly. 
Between 1980 and 1986, Alaska's population rose 32%, by far the fastest rate of increase of any state. 

   But as the state's oil-based economy softened, the traditional migration pattern reversed. 
Gregory Williams, Alaska's state demographer, estimates that in the 12 months ended in July 1987, up to 15,000 more people left Alaska than moved into the state. 
That was more than enough to offset the natural population increase of about 10,000 for the same period. 

   With Alaska's unemployment rate close to 10%, a lot of out-migrants have headed for California and the Pacific Northwest, where the job market is healthier. 
There is a plus side to this outflow: Sluicing out excess workers should bring the local labor supply into better balance and help stanch the state's population loss. 
"We're seeing signs that this (population drain) has begun to bottom out," says Mr. Williams. 

   Ten states either lost population or had no population gain in the 12 months ended in July 1986, the most recent estimates published by the Census Bureau. 
They are: Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming.

   PHILLY MEETS THE JOB SQUEEZE: First Pennsylvania Bank's quarterly survey of executives in Philadelphia-area companies picks up some of the same labor shortage complaints that New England executives have been making the past couple of years. 

   Nearly 70% of the metro Philadelphia companies questioned said they planned to add employees next year, from managers to production workers, and all but a few said finding these workers would be tough. 
Higher pay doesn't seem to help much. 
The companies are already paying an average $6.58 an hour for entry-level workers. 
Only 11% said they had anyone on the payroll making the $3.35 an hour minimum wage. 

   Despite the labor crunch, only 7% of the companies said they'd consider moving operations to an area with more abundant labor.

   LITTLE PHNOM PENH: Long Beach, Calif., is now reputed to have the largest concentration of ethnic Cambodians outside Southeast Asia. 
No one has yet done a full-fledged head count, but California's education department says there are 3,325 "English impaired" students in Long Beach schools whose first language is Khmer (the Cambodian national language), double the number of the next-highest school district. 

   Add to this figure Cambodian students fluent in English, factor in parents, toddlers and in-laws at home, plus other adults, and the Cambodian population in Long Beach could fall in the 25,000 to 40,000 range.

   NORTH DAKOTANS TRADITIONALLY VOTE in large numbers, but in the November 1986 congressional elections, they beat every state in both registration (an amazing 95% of the voting age population) and turnout at the polls (73%). 
A fiercely contested U.S. Senate race, in which Democrat Kent Conrad nosed out Republican incumbent Mark Andrews, helped fire the voters enthusiasm. 

   Idaho, Montana, Oregon and South Dakota all had turnouts of more than 60% of the voting-age populace in 1986, according to a new voting behavior analysis from the Census Bureau. 
The worst performer: Kentucky, where only one-third of potentially eligible voters cast ballots.

   ARIZONA PURCHASING MANAGERS see signs of prosperity mixed with looming inflation. 
Average delivery time on incoming shipments is now the longest since mid-1984. 
Inventory levels continue to grow, and new orders in August and September were unusually strong. 
Meanwhile, price increases in the last two months were at the fastest rate in more than three years. 
The indicators are from the Purchasing Management Association of Arizona's September survey.

Three-fourths of 143 corporate relocation administrators questioned said employees reassigned to the New York metropolitan area either resisted the move or refused to go. 
Other areas where Runzheimer says above-average cost-of-living is a significant barrier to relocation: Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco.

States Hoping to Hit Jackpot
With Big Combined Lottery

   THE BIGGEST get-rich-quick scheme in the history of the Republic, a multistate lottery, is in the works. 
Just imagine. 
Citizens of New York, Illinois, Oregon and other states competing with each other every week for a single jackpot running as high as $80 million. 
Millions of citizens will buy tickets in this, the closest thing yet to a national lottery, and participating states will reap millions of dollars for worthy causes. 
All of this, lottery promoters say, is the next best thing to a sure bet. 

   Names for the gambling extravaganza are already being tossed around: America's Game and The All-American Game are favorites. 
There is an organizing body, the Multistate Lotto Board, headed by Peter O'Connell, Rhode Island's lottery director. 
Mr. O'Connell says the game will be running by fall. 

   Two hurdles remain. 
Many states need approval of their legislatures to participate. 
And enough states must sign on to make the enterprise worthwhile. 
Odds that each will occur appear good. 

   The idea for a nationwide multistate lottery germinated in the Northeast. 
Small states there have been restless under the existing lottery system, which operates on two basic principles. 
One: The size of a lottery jackpot is determined by the number of people buying tickets. 
Two: As jackpots get bigger, more and more people shell out money to play. 

   THIS PUTS STATES with small populations at a disadvantage. 
Rhode Island's biggest-ever jackpot, $2.2 million, looks puny next to the grand prizes offered twice weekly in neighboring Massachusetts that routinely run $4 million or so. 

   Mr. O'Connell says Rhode Islanders regularly play the Massachusetts and Connecticut lotteries, siphoning off sales that would otherwise stay home. 
"People will chase a large jackpot," he says. 
When New York's lottery was nearing its record $41 million jackpot in August 1985, he adds, "people would get one person and fly him to New York to buy tickets. 
They were abandoning the Massachusetts and Rhode Island lotteries and sending money to New York. 
That tells you something." 

   What it tells small states, Mr. O'Connell thinks, is that they should band together to keep the money at home. 
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont fought the attraction of the Massachusetts lottery by joining forces. 
Tristate Megabucks, the nation's only regional lottery, has delivered. 
The three states, with fewer than three million people, ran up a jackpot of $9.6 million last June. 

   Canada is Exhibit B. 
The 10 Canadian provinces conduct a combined lottery draw every Wednesday and Saturday. 
The four-year-old nationwide lotto game, run by the provinces themselves, is offered in addition to each province's own lottery. 

   FEWER PEOPLE now play the lotteries in their own provinces, but this is more than offset by huge sales for the nationwide game. 
"If the provincial games in 1982 were at 100, then they're at 80 now, but the total lottery volume is 220," says Guy Simonis, president of British Columbia Lottery Corp. 
Since the provinces run both games, they are money ahead. 

   Revenue this year in the Canadian interprovincial lottery should approach $2 billion (Canadian). 
"This in a country with the population of California," Mr. Simonis notes. 

   Small states aren't the only multistate boosters. 
John Quinn, director of the New York lottery, says it's smart tactics for his state to join. 
If surrounding states that traditionally offer smaller lottery prizes than New York suddenly start offering a piece of the big-buck multistate jackpot, New Yorkers might start crossing state lines to play the multistate game. 
"I think we'd be losing some sales," Mr. Quinn says. 
But if New York's legislature gives the multistate concept a thumbs up, "there's no doubt in my mind our bottom line will improve." 

   HERE'S HOW the game will work: States will sell weekly multistate tickets in addition to their existing lottery games. 
The game will be a lotto format, players selecting six numbers from a predetermined field. 
Each state will administer its own multistate ticket sales. 
If no one has the exact numbers, the prize rolls over and continues to build. 
Organizers say they'll cap the jackpot at $80 million, with any extra being used to build the next grand prize. 

   The winning numbers will be drawn in Chicago, probably on Saturday night. 
States will contribute to the jackpot fund in proportion to the number of tickets they sell. 
If Oregon sells 5% of a week's multistate lottery tickets, it kicks in 5% of the jackpot total. 

   Michael Jones, a Chicago-based lottery consultant, says the key sections are mostly technical, such as how to ensure uniform payout rules and audit standards. 
Putting computer software and drawing equipment in place can be done quickly, he says. 

   The list of interested states has shifted in recent weeks. 
The hot prospects now are thought to include Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. 

   Pennsylvania, which claims to offer more lottery games than any state, is on the sidelines. 
"We might be adding one too many products," says lottery director Blair Gettig. 
"Right now, we don't see the advantage." 

   Mr. O'Connell of the lottery board doesn't mind the dissent. 
"I'd start with three states -- New York, Illinois and Rhode Island -- but we expect more," he says. 
"Once we're up and running, it's only a matter of time before they'll all be trying to join."

Born in captivity and then released in the wild, he started doing

   A young bald eagle that turned chicken
thief after he was released in the wild is back in the slammer.
   State ornithologist Jim D. Wilson has recommended a short stay
behind bars for the wayward eagle, but plans to give him a second
chance at freedom.
   The eagle, nicknamed ``E,'' was released at the Schell-Osage
Wildlife Area in west-central Missouri in July as part of a
Department of Conservation program to re-establish a breeding
population of eagles in the state.
   Seventy-four young bald eagles were raised in artificial nests
with only minimal human contact and released into the wilds of
Missouri under a 10-year program which just ended.
   ``E,'' which came from a wild nest in Wisconsin, began doing
un-eaglelike things after he or she - it's difficult to determine
the sex of an eagle - arrived in Missouri.
   Although most eagles shy away from humans, ``E'' didn't mind at
all that a Daviess County farm family was watching in amazement as
he repeatedly killed and ate their tame ducks.
   Wildlife officials thought the bird had only momentarily
deviated from its normal diet, consisting mainly of rodents. So
they recaptured the eagle and released it again about 75 miles away
at the Squaw Creek Wildlife Refuge in northwestern Missouri.
   However, ``E'' turned up in late August in southern Iowa, eating
dead baby pigs at another farm. The young eagle was captured again
and returned to Squaw Creek, only to be caught red-handed a few
days later eating a chicken in a farmer's chicken house in Atchison
County.
   This time ``E'' was rounded up and transferred to the Dickerson
Park Zoo in Springfield, which specializes in the care of injured
eagles and other birds of prey.
   Bald eagles winter around major lakes and rivers in Missouri by
the hundreds, and Wilson plans to release ``E'' near his cousins in
February in hopes he will learn proper eagle behavior.
   ``What apparently happened to this bird is it somehow found out
that farmyards were a place you could find some easy pickins,''
Wilson says.
   ``I'd like to give it one more try. I'll release it with another
flock of eagles at a wildlife area where it won't come in contact
with humans very easily and where there is an abundant natural food
supply.
   ``If it doesn't adapt to the wild, it will be a zoo bird. I
don't really want that; nobody does. There are plenty of zoo
eagles.''
   Of the 74 eagles the conservation department has released in the
state, only one other bird behaved in a similar fashion, Wilson
says. That eagle ended up getting killed by a truck in Kansas while
eating an animal killed in the road, which is also uncharacteristic
of eagles.
   Overall, the conservation department's efforts to get eagles to
nest again in Missouri are showing signs of paying off, Wilson
says. Three pairs nested successfully near the Mingo National
Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Missouri this year, and another
pair nested at an undisclosed location in central Missouri.
   The eagles are equipped with colored wing tags. More than 40 of
the eagles released at the Mingo and Schell-Osage wildlife areas
have been observed in surrounding states and as far away as Texas
and Colorado.
   It takes about five years before eagles are mature and ready to
nest.
   ``They are similar to salmon in that they should return to where
they were raised to raise their own young,'' Wilson says.
   Eagles began disappearing in the state as large numbers of
settlers moved in around the turn of the century.
   Ironically, habitat may be better for eagles in Missouri now
than ever before.
   ``For one thing, the eagle is now protected by law and people
know it so there's less disturbance of them,'' Wilson says. ``In
addition, eagles are water birds and like our abundant
reservoirs.''

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.

<TEXT>
   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
   California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the
435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.
   The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.
grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director Barbara
Bryant said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by New York City and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the Commerce
Department must decide by July 15 whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the
1990 census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of
the House census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.
   Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," Mrs. Bryant said. In the
past decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,
while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and the
Midwest by 1.3%.
   The reassignment of seats in the House reflects these
trends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the Northeast and
Midwest. In addition to California, states adding seats
include Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gains
three seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia
and Washington, which each gain one seat.
   Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;
and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the District of
Columbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,
Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
Senate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia and Wyoming.

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World
War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is
retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double
the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the
University of Miami.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographics
magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' Longino said in analyzing 1980 Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for
the study.
   Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and New Jersey had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in Connecticut and Washington, Longino found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was $8,414 in 1980.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, Longino noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the 1940s.
   Just over half (51.1 percent) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7
percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5
percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as Florida, Nevada and New
Jersey; in Connecticut, where many New York executives have
retired, and Hawaii.
   Hawaii has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, Longino noted.
   For the pension elite, Connecticut and Washington placed well,
as did Florida, Maryland, New Jersey. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla.; San
Diego and Palm Springs, Calif.; and along the east coast of Mobile
Bay, Ala.
   Longino is director of the Center for Social Research in Aging
at the University of Miami, and his work was partially funded by
the American Association of Retired Persons. American Demographics,
published by Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., reports on population matters.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

<HEAD>Danforth Seeks Halt Of Rail Shipments of TMI Wastes</HEAD>

   Energy Secretary John Herrington was asked
Wednesday to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant until a new study can be made of
the route by which they are transported.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., ranking minority member of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, made the request in
the wake of an incident involving a TMI train in the St. Louis area
earlier this month.
   Herrington took the senator's request under consideration, a
Danforth aide said.
   The Federal Railroad Administration confirmed on Wednesday it is
investigating a rail car switching incident on Feb. 9 just before a
TMI train passed through St. Louis. The agency is determining
whether there were violations of rail regulations, which could draw
civil penalties of up to $10,000.
   The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the
damaged TMI plant in Pennsylvania to a government laboratory in
Idaho.
   Bill Loftus, an FRA spokesman, said the possible violations
involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to the
TMI train in a railyard in East St. Louis, Ill.
   The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable
material, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous
cargo.
   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations
by the rail switching yard, the Union Pacific Railroad which
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that
was shipping the car.
   Federal rail regulations, Loftus said, require shippers to
properly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibit
switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a
train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled
freight.
   Herrington met on Wednesday with Danforth and several other
senators from states along the TMI rail route. The Missourian wants
the Energy Department to halt the waste shipments until the
Transportation Department can study the rail route used by the
Energy Department to move the materials to the laboratory in Idaho
Falls, Idaho.
   Since the shipments began in 1986, Missouri officials have
complained that the government's route takes the radioactive
materials through densely populated cities such as St. Louis.

<HEAD>Study: When It Comes To The Pentagon, Most Districts Give More Than
They Get</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon costs most congressional
districts more in taxes than they get back through military
spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because
of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the
effects of federal spending.
   ``These numbers should look quite different five or six years
from now,'' James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a study
that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on
the deal.
   ``The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but
I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go
into the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in part
as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military
budget,'' said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan State
Uniersity.
   Anderson, a senior fellow of Employment Research Associates of
Lansing, Mich., an independent, non-profit economic consulting firm
that conducted the study, said the findings run counter to
arguments often heard on Capitol Hill.
   ``For years, members of Congress would say that even if they
wanted to, they couldn't vote against military spending because it
meant money coming into their districts,'' Anderson said. ``But we
found that the Pentagon budget isn't a boon to most congressional
districts, it's a drain.''
   The study was based on fiscal year 1987, during which U.S.
military outlays came to $282 billion. An additional $7.1 billion
was spent on military categories of foreign aid.
   For the study, that $289.1 billion was apportioned among the
states and then divided among congressional districts by a formula
designed to take into account income levels as well as population.
   The North Central region of the country was the biggest loser,
with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category. In the
Northeast, there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers. The
South had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained. The West was
the closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts, heavily
concentrated in Southern California, gaining.
   The district with the biggest net gain from military spending,
more than $3 billion, was the 10th District of Virginia, home of
the Pentagon. The biggest net loss, $1.2 billion, was in the 7th
District of Texas, in Houston.
   Anderson said he included prime contracts, military salaries and
wages and retirement pay but not veterans' payments in calculating
defense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about 40
percent of federal taxes go for federal expenditures. He said this
is higher than some other estimates, which run between 26 and 28
percent, because he did not include trust funds dedicated to a
specific project in his total.
   The study said 104 districts registered a net loss of $500
million or more.
   Of these, 19 districts were in New York, 13 in Illinois, 11 in
Texas, eight each in Ohio and Michigan, seven each in Florida and
New Jersey, five in California, four in Pennsylvania, three each in
Missouri, North Carolina and Wisconsin, two in Massachusetts and
one each in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia.
   States registering an overall net gain were Alabama, $6.2
million; Alaska, $310.1 million; Arizona, $1 billion; California,
$2 billion; Colorado, $737.4 million; Connecticut, $115.5 million;
Georgia, $299 million; Hawaii, $1.3 billion; Maine $71.9 million.
   Also, Maryland, $973.9 million; Massachusetts, $1.16 billion;
Mississippi, $552.9 million; Missouri, $2 billion; New Mexico,
$1.47 billion; South Carolina, $1 billion; Utah, $664.3 million;
Virginia, $9.4 billion; and Washington $1 billion.
   The most dramatic change was in Texas, which went from a net
gain in a previous study in 1981 to a loss of $5.26 billion.
   Other losing states were Arkansas, $612.8 million; Delaware,
$459.9 million; Florida, $3 billion; Idaho, $220.7 million;
Illinois, $11.62 billion; Indiana, $2.82 billion; Iowa, $2.19
billion; Kansas, $671.2 million; Kentucky, $1.25 billion;
Louisiana, $1.57 billion; Michigan, $8.33 billion; Minnesota, $2.26
billion.
   Also, Montana, $502.7 million; Nebraska, $942.1 million; Nevada,
$97.9 million; New Hampshire, $395.4 million; New Jersey, $7.57
billion; New York, $13.6 billion; North Carolina, $1.9 billion.
   Also, North Dakota, $237.9 million; Ohio, $5.75 billion;
Oklahoma, $1.18 billion; Oregon, $2.18 billion; Pennsylvania, $7.64
billion; Rhode Island, $346.6 million.
   Also, South Dakota, $357.2 million; Tennessee, $2.2 billion;
Vermont, $369.6 million; West Virginia, $1.27 billion; Wisconsin,
$3.89 billion; and Wyoming, $409 million.

below-average spending and small classes.

Statistics based on the 1990-91 school year indicate that the
national pupil-teacher ratio for public elementary and
secondary schools was 17.2 to 1. The average expenditure per
pupil was $4,885.
   The estimated outlay per pupil was lowest in Utah, at
$2,727. Utah also had the highest pupil-teacher ratio, at 25
to 1. Eleven other states, including Alabama, California,
Colorado and Georgia, had both lower-than-average spending
per student and bigger-than-average class sizes.
   Small classes can mean higher costs. Spending per student
was greatest, at $8,161, in the District of Columbia, which
also had the second-lowest pupil-teacher ratio, 13.3 to 1.
Thirteen states, including all of the Middle Atlantic and New
England states, had smaller-than-average classes and
above-average outlays per student.
   But 15 states, including Illinois, North Carolina and
Texas, combine lower-than-average pupil-teacher ratios with
below-average spending per student. In some of these states,
including Arkansas and West Virginia, the low expenditures
may stem partly from their low cost of living, in contrast to
the Northeastern states.
   Among the remaining states, Minnesota and Ohio have
average class sizes and above-average costs per student,
while Michigan and Oregon have both large classes and high
costs.
                                                                                                       

   Households Bring
   Most Bacon Home
                                                                                                       

   SPENDING on food prepared and eaten at home grew faster in
recent years than outlays on food away from home, reversing
the pattern of most of the '80s.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that spending in
the at-home category averaged $2,485 a household in 1990, up
5.3% from 1988, while spending on food away from home rose
1.7% to $1,811.
   Many nutritionists recommend eating more vegetables and
grains and making animal flesh a side dish, but the nation's
diet still appears to center on meaty main dishes: The
biggest portion of at-home food spending, $668, went for
meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
   Fruits and vegetables were the second-leading category, at
$408; cereal and bakery goods third, at $368; and dairy
products fourth, at $295. Households also spent an average of
$84 on various combinations of these main categories, as
found in canned, frozen and prepared foods.
   Basic foods need embellishment, however. U.S. households
spent an average of $74 on condiments and seasonings, and $68
on fats and oils.
   Then there are the real nonessentials. Spending on sugar
and sweets, including candy, gum and jam, averaged $94 in
1990. Potato chips, nuts and other snacks accounted for $67.
Miscellaneous prepared foods, including baby food, accounted
for another $146.
   To wash everything down, households spent an average of
$213 on beverages, including coffee, tea, soda and powdered
drinks. (Milk and juices are counted in the dairy and
fruit/vegetable categories.)
   Altogether, spending on food and beverages accounted for
16% of consumer spending in 1990.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. Population Growth
   Picks Up After Census
                                                                                                       

   POPULATION growth has accelerated in the U.S.
   The nation's population rose 0.9% annually in the 1980s.
But recent Census Bureau estimates show growth accelerated to
a 1.1% annual rate between April 1, 1990, and July 1, 1991.
   Several states lost population in the 15 months following
the 1990 census, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
North Dakota, as well as the District of Columbia. But Iowa,
which lost population in the 1980s, grew at a 0.5% rate in
the latest period.
   Growth in some states has accelerated steadily. Nevada's
population rose an average of 3.3% a year in the early 1980s,
4.9% in the late 1980s and at an estimated 5.3% rate in the
1990-91 period. Growth has also risen steadily in the
Carolinas, Delaware, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Tennessee,
Washington and Wisconsin.
   Several Midwestern states whose populations fell in the
early 1980s are now seeing growth, including Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.
   On the other hand, growth has slowed in some states,
including Arizona, Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey.
Florida grew at a yearly pace of 2.1% in 1990-91, compared
with 2.9% in the early 1980s and 2.8% in the late 1980s. Even
so, it is currently the seventh fastest-growing state;
Arizona ranks 10th.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE FIRST employer-provided retirement plan in the U.S.
was set up by American Express in 1875, says the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It applied only to disabled elderly
employees with at least 20 years of service. In 1987, the two
main types of private pensions numbered more than 872,000
plans covering 78 million workers. . . . Of the 13 largest
medical specialties, only pediatrics has shown a significant
increase in share of office visits in recent years. The
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey shows that visits to
pediatricians accounted for 12.6% of office visits made to
physicians in 1989, up from 11.4% in 1985. . . . The share of
prescription-drug costs that consumers pay fell to 72% in
1989 from 78% in 1980 because of increased spending by public
programs (such as Medicaid) and other third parties (such as
employer-provided insurance), says the Employee Benefit
Research Institute.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, on a political trip
for his vice president George Bush, declared today that the
national economy is strong and ``what we have seen in the last
eight years is only the beginning.''
   ``We intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right
through the '90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the
federal government can never again spend and tax the American
people into another economic nightmare,'' Reagan said.
   The president's remarks were prepared for delivery at a
Republican rally at Southeast Missouri State University in this
Mississippi River shipping center.
   He was to speak later in the day to an expected crowd of 1,000
at a $250-a-plate GOP fund-raising dinner in St. Louis.
   In his Cape Girardeau speech, Reagan said children born today
``will know the brightest future the world has ever seen.''
   ``That bright future is also yours,'' he told his audience. ``It
is your birthright as Americans, and what we have seen in the last
eight years is only the beginning.''
   The national economy has been expanding for more than five years
following the steep recession that marked Reagan's first two years
in office.
   ``Ultimately, the choice before the American people is the
choice between two visions,'' he said. ``It is the choice between
the policies of liberalism or the policies of America's political
mainstream.''
   The president, a former Democrat, said that party's ``liberal
leadership ... has turned a once proud party of hope and
affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and
negativism.''
   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's
memory lane, it starts to look like a `Nightmare on Elm Street.' If
you want to remember how things really were just a few years back,
think of the year 1979,'' he said.
   ``In that one year, Iran, Nicaragua and Grenada were all lost.
That was the year 1979. Don't we have the right to ask the American
people: If the liberals return to power, what happens in 1989?''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in advance of the trip that
Reagan would be giving ``traditional political speeches'' trying to
win support for the Republican ticket of Bush and Dan Quayle.
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the Nov. 8 election.
   GOP candidates hoping to benefit from the Missouri events
include Gov. John Ashcroft, seeking a second term against
Democratic State Rep. Betty Hearnes of Charleston, who is the wife
of former Gov. Warren Hearnes, and Sen. John Danforth, opposed by
State Sen. Jay Nixon of Hillsboro as he seeks his third term.
   Both Ashcroft and Danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   Bush, speaking Tuesday in Jefferson City, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, Carter and Mondale, and who knows who else.''
   Reagan took Missouri's 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the
popular vote against then-President Carter in 1980 and swept the
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against Walter Mondale in
1984.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit Cape
Girardeau previously was William Howard Taft on Oct. 26, 1902.
   In St. Louis, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than 2 million, the president was to speak
at an event for the Missouri GOP Victory '88 fund.

   A federal judge Wednesday sided with three
states and ordered the Army of Corps of Engineers to maintain water
levels at a huge Missouri River reservoir in order to protect the
states' fishing industry.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy's ruling regarding Lake Oahe
prompted shippers to begin moving barges off the Missouri's
730-mile shipping channel to keep them from being marooned as the
river falls.
   The order will virtually halt navigation along the channel,
which runs from Sioux City, Iowa, to St. Louis, said Chet Worm,
chief of the corps' reservoir regulation branch in Omaha, Neb.
Officials warned that power shortages also could result.
   The ruling was in response to a request by North Dakota, South
Dakota and Montana.
   Those states' governors said the order could help end disputes
over management of the drought-hit Missouri, at 2,540 miles the
longest river in the United States. But spokesmen for Govs. Terry
Branstad of Iowa and Kay Orr of Nebraska, two states downstream,
criticized it.
   ``The news is very alarming,'' said Orr's legal counsel, Bud
Cuca.
   Downstream states rely on the river for water for drinking,
cooling power plants and sustaining fish and wildlife populations
of their own, officials said.
   Conmy ordered the Corps of Engineers to maintain the reservoir
at its current level until June 1, when the lake's walleyed pike
hatch will have ended. South Dakota officials contend the hatch
would have been destroyed had the corps been allowed to proceed
with plans to lower the level by 3 feet this month.
   Lake Oahe spans both Dakotas and has a storage capacity of 23.3
million acre-feet, or enough water to put 23.3 million acres under
1 foot of water.
   The governors of Montana and the Dakotas contend the corps is
sacrificing millions of dollars' worth of recreation and fishing
interests in their states to provide enough water for shipping.
   The corps filed notice it would appeal Conmy's order, U.S.
Attorney Steve Easton said. But South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson
said the three states have already won.
   Even an expedited appeal is likely to take a few weeks,
Mickelson said. Before it is decided, ``we will have accomplished
most of what we set out to do,'' he said.
   ``There is justice after all, and this running battle has come
to a temporary halt, at least,'' North Dakota Gov. George Sinner
added. ``The water will stop flowing away from us, and we will stop
being washed down the river.''
   Attorneys for the corps argued the agency had balanced a number
of disparate needs in deciding how to manage the flow of water from
six upper Missouri dams.
   Sinner, Mickelson and Montana Gov. Stan Stephens said they
intended no long-term harm to states along the lower Missouri.
   ``My intention is to ... get them to sit down with us and
recognize the contemporary needs of all the states,'' Mickelson
said.
   Governors of the Missouri Basin states plan to discuss the
dispute next Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, following a meeting by
the executive committee of the National Governors Association,
Branstad said.
   Charles Findlay, a Justice Department attorney representing the
corps, said it may have to reduce the Missouri's flow through
August due to Conmy's order, to avoid harming two rare birds that
nest near the river, the piping plover and the interior least tern.
   If that happens, electricity shortages could crop up downstream,
said Omaha Public Power District spokesman Mark Gautier.
   Barge owners worried Wednesday that they might not be able to
get their vessels off the river in time.
   ``We've got five barges up above Omaha right now,'' said Roger
Blaske, co-owner of Blaske Marine Inc. of Alton, Ill.
   Depending on how fast the river falls, the barges could be
stranded, Blaske said. ``I guess we'd just hang them up on a stump
somewhere and hope they're there next fall,'' he said.
   Missouri River marinas also could be put out of business as the
river drops an expected three feet as a result of the decision,
said John Ferrell, a corps spokesman in Omaha, Neb.
   But Sinner, Mickelson and other officials say upper basin states
have suffered virtually all the impact of a lingering drought
entering its third year in the upper Great Plains.
   ``It's the worst drought in this century, and there's going to
be losers,'' said former South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, the
lead attorney in the three states' lawsuit.
   ``The point we make is there shouldn't be any winners,'' Janklow
said. ``We should all suffer together.''

<LEADPARA>  Steelville, Mo., an Ozarks stream town that had been billing itself as the
canoe center of Missouri, has a new title: center of population for the United
States. The U.S. Census Bureau made the title official Tuesday.;   Larry
Taylor, a Census Bureau geographer, said the center of population is the point
at which an imaginary flat, weightless and rigid map of the United States
would balance if each of the 248,709,873 U.S. residents as of April 1 were of
identical weight. In July, USA Today stirred excitement in the area when it
pegged the new population center as a farm near the unincorporated area of
Keysville, south of Steelville. But Taylor said the newspaper's calculations
turned out to be about 10 miles off the mark. The population center has been
moving south and west since 1790.  </LEADPARA>

   America's Infant Mortality Problem: Parents

   Over the past 20 years, a succession of presidents and
Congresses have voiced alarm over America's level of infant
mortality, and have authorized programs and policies to bring
it down. But the American infant mortality problem endures --
and by some measures, seems to be worsening.
   To be sure, the proportion of babies dying before their
first birthday has been declining in the U.S. Yet in relative
terms, America's pace of progress has been so slow that many
countries have surpassed us. According to the Department of
Health and Human Services, the U.S. infant mortality rate is
higher than those of 23 other industrialized countries and is
twice as high as that of Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest initiative to revitalize progress against
infant mortality was unveiled last year by the Bush
administration. Known as the Healthy Start Program, it
proposes to halve infant mortality over the next five years
in selected localities by "wrapping pregnant women and babies
in a blanket of care" fashioned from the "coordination of
federal, state, local, and private programs."
   Unfortunately, there is little reason to suppose that this
latest effort will be any more successful than its
predecessors. For almost a generation, in fact, Washington's
infant mortality "strategy" has been a plan for battle in a
bygone world. By and large, our public health policies
presume that high infant mortality levels bespeak lack of
household income or medical services -- quantities a
government might supply. In modern America, however, material
poverty and inadequate health care are hardly the only
threats to infant survival -- and may not be the major ones.
   The economic data cannot explain why some poorer groups of
Americans have lower infant-mortality rates than some richer
groups. By the Census Bureau's most recent estimates, for
example, Asians and Pacific Islanders have a higher poverty
rate than U.S. whites, yet their infant mortality rate,
according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), is
substantially lower. By the same token, infant mortality
rates for Hispanic Americans and non-Hispanic whites are
reportedly just about the same, even though the poverty rate
for Hispanic children is more than twice as high.
   Nor can economic factors account for differences in infant
mortality rates between U.S. blacks and residents of Puerto
Rico. By a wide variety of measures, it is U.S. blacks who
are more affluent. Their educational attainment is higher;
their unemployment rates are markedly lower; their per-capita
income is more than 50% higher. But infant mortality in 1988
was two-fifths higher for blacks than for babies born in
Puerto Rico. Clearly, traditional notions of poverty do not
explain what is happening in America today.
   Inadequate medical care is another less than fully
satisfactory explanation for the problem. In Western
societies, the great majority of infant deaths occur within
days of birth; the lower the baby's birthweight, the greater
the risk. At any given high-risk birthweight, however,
perinatal survival chances in the 1980s were substantially
better in the U.S. than in Norway or Japan -- frontrunners in
the infant mortality race. This advantage showed up for
blacks as well as whites. Since medical intervention plays a
decisive role in the survival of low-birthweight babies,
these figures strongly suggest that U.S. infant health
services on the whole are very good and broadly available to
those in need.
   America's infant mortality problem has less to do with the
survival chances of any low-birthweight baby than with the
unusually large numbers of infants born into high-risk
categories. Among blacks, the incidence of low birthweight
(defined as 5.5 pounds or less at delivery) is not only
higher than that of virtually any other Western population
but also twice as high as that of U.S. whites. Yet the
incidence among U.S. whites is high as well -- nearly twice
that of Norway, for example. When one considers that infant
mortality rates are roughly 20 times higher for
low-birthweight babies than for those above 5.5 pounds, the
significance of America's disposition toward low birthweight
becomes deadly clear.
   Why does America produce so many low-birthweight babies?
The answer may have much to do with the behavior of
parents-to-be. Evidence suggests that the attitudes,
practices and life styles of many American parents --
including many who are neither poor nor poorly educated --
are exposing U.S. babies to unfamiliar and unnecessary
hazards.
   A 1989 CDC study underscores this point. According to the
CDC's survey of nearly 8,000 mothers, poorer white women had
the same incidence of low birthweight as more affluent ones.
On the other hand, white babies described as "unwanted or
mistimed" had a substantially greater risk of low birthweight
than those described as "wanted at conception."
   CDC data show that one of the maternal characteristics
most strongly associated with low birthweight is
out-of-wedlock childbearing. Regardless of a mother's race or
age, her child is more likely to be low birthweight if
illegitimate. And regardless of a mother's race or age,
infant mortality is higher for out-of-wedlock births. (CDC
data tend to ignore the important role fathers play in
infants' well-being.)
   It has long been argued that the correspondence between
illegitimacy and higher infant mortality reflects only the
social disadvantages characteristic of unwed mothers. But
illegitimacy has been going "mainstream": Of the more than
one million babies born out of wedlock each year, more than
half are to white mothers, and more are to mothers 25 or
older than to teen-agers. More than a quarter of the white
single mothers in their early 30s now have at least some
college education.
   Other data from the CDC are even more instructive.
According to an eight-state pilot study, infant mortality
rates were higher for unmarried mothers who were college
graduates than for married grade-school dropouts. This result
showed up for both whites and blacks.
   Why should this be? Part of the answer may be suggested by
new data from Missouri on risky behavior during pregnancy. In
this study of 60,000 births, there was a strong inverse
relation between a mother's years of schooling and her
propensity to smoke during pregnancy. Even so, unwed college
graduates, irrespective of race, were more likely to smoke
during pregnancy than the average married woman -- even
though that "average" woman had almost an even chance of
being a high school drop-out.
   Unwed mothers, of course, are not the only parents to
engage in practices prejudicial to infant health, nor are
nicotine and "tar" the only hazardous substances to which a
fetus can be exposed. Illegal drug use during pregnancy can
hurt a fetus, although data on the prevalence of such
practices are hard to come by. It is widely supposed that
such behavior is characteristic mainly of impoverished, inner
city, minority populations. But some recent data from Rhode
Island suggest otherwise.
   At two intervals in late 1989, the Rhode Island Department
of Health tested women in labor for illicit drugs: cocaine,
marijuana, opiates, amphetamines. The sample was
representative of the state's entire population. Overall, 7
1/2% of the mothers tested positive for one or more of these
drugs. Mothers who were black, young or poor were more likely
to test positive. But what is perhaps most alarming were the
rates reported for groups usually considered low risk. Fully
7% of the white mothers tested positive. Women 25 years of
age or older recorded a similar rate. And 6.6% of the mothers
not classed as "poverty status" tested positive.
   Such behavior by mothers-to-be is all too characteristic
of the infant mortality problem in modern America. And
unfortunately, the traditional tools of social policy are not
easily applied against dangerous parental behavior. Despite
ever greater schooling for the population at large, the
proportion of babies receiving no prenatal care, or care
delayed until the last trimester of pregnancy, is slightly
higher today than it was in the mid-1970s. Education can be
highly effective when lack of knowledge is a constraint; it
fares less well when the problem is a lack of motivation.
   Key elements in the social policy and public health
communities appear determined not to confront this problem --
or even to acknowledge its existence.
   One may read the Ford Foundation's "The Common Good," a
major 1989 study largely given over to recommendations on the
welfare and future of America's children, without once
encountering the notion of parental responsibility. The
Department of Health and Human Services' 700-page 1991 policy
document entitled "Healthy People 2000" manages to omit any
mention of the correlation between low birthweight and
illegitimacy. And in 1990, a testy editorial note in the
CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Review, a leading public
health periodical, scolded that "marital status confers
neither risks nor protection to the infant," even though the
CDC's own data contradicted the assertion.
   Medical advances and increased health expenditures promise
the continuation of progress against U.S. infant mortality.
Unless the problem of hazardous parental behavior is
controlled, however, the infant mortality rate is likely to
remain needlessly high. It may well be that our government
and legal system, which prize liberty, are not particularly
suited to enforce model behavior upon negligent
parents-to-be. But it is not too much to ask our leaders and
health specialists to speak plainly about what it is that
really ails our nation's babies.

Boise, Idaho, grew 23 percent, to 125,738. Salem, Ore., picked up 19 percent
to 107,786, and Huntsville, Ala., gained nearly 12 percent to 159,789.;    The

   Gobs of oil continued to wash ashore in
Washington and British Columbia two weeks after a spill from a
tugboat-tanker collision that one official said could scar the coast
for ``months if not years.''
   As experts assessed the ecological damage to the Pacific
Northwest, Shell Oil Co. estimated Thursday that a ruptured pipeline
in Missouri spilled 840,000 gallons of oil Dec. 24 near a tributary
of the Missouri River in one of the biggest inland spills in U.S.
history.
   Shell has recovered about 441,000 gallons, company spokesman Tony
Canino said.
   The state of Missouri is ``probably headed for legal action''
against Shell for not notifying officials immediately after
discovering the rupture, a spokesman for the state Department of
Natural Resources said.
   In northwest Washington, experts hiked along the shoreline of
Olympic National Park Thursday to assess damage to fragile
tidepools, kelp beds, rocky shores and wildlife from an estimated
231,000 gallons of bunker oil. The oil spilled after the Dec. 22
collision of a tugboat and a tanker in heavy seas two miles off
Grays Harbor on the central Washington coast.
   Olympic Chief Ranger Chuck Janda said a damage assessment should
be ready by Saturday.
   Evidence of the spill, which has washed up along 300 miles of
coast from Newport, Ore., to Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
will remain ``a long, long time _ months if not years,'' he said.
   Tides and heavy surf appear to be gradually shifting the oil
northward, Janda said.
   State wildlife officials say about 3,700 sea birds have died in
Washington, with no estimates immediately available from Oregon or
British Columbia. Janda said contaminated birds still were being
found.
   Volunteers had cleaned 890 birds and released 42 by late
Thursday, said Susan Ewing of the state Department of Wildlife.
Among the species hardest hit have been murres, auklets, scoters,
loons and grebes, officials said.
   Many beaches along the rugged coast are accessible only by
helicopter or on foot at low tide. Janda said cleanup crews are
using choppers to haul out 20,000 pounds of oil-soaked sand, kelp,
driftwood and other material daily. The cleanup could continue for
several weeks, he said.
   At Canada's Pacific Rim National Park, 100 miles to the north on
Vancouver Island, crews began preparing to remove blotches of oil
from 87 miles of beaches surrounding Barkley Sound. In some places,
the stench overpowered the smell of salt air.
   Sause Bros. Ocean Towing of Coos Bay, Ore., owner of the barge
and tug, said the cost of cleanup in Washington alone was $10,000 a
day. The cost is covered by insurance, it said.
   Shell's 840,000-gallon estimate on the size of the Missouri spill
was the first the company has given. It would be on the scale of a
spill a year ago from an Ashland Oil Co. storage tank on the
Monongahela River near Pittsburgh, which federal officials said then
was among the nation's worst.
   Published estimates of the Monongahela spill have ranged from
500,000 to 1 million gallons.
   The oil erupted from a 35-foot rupture in a buried pipeline near
the Gasconade River, about 140 miles west of St. Louis. Oil has
moved since into the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
   Beginning today, Shell is increasing cleanup efforts on the
Gasconade and Missouri rivers, which will take ``at least two more
weeks,'' Canino said.
   Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch Cos. recalled some of the 2,000 workers
to its St. Louis brewery Thursday to begin a test run. Busch stopped
brewing beer Tuesday after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the
plant's water supply.
   The spill hasn't threatened drinking water.

   RETAILERS TAKE NOTE. Southeastern Connecticut and New York's Long Island will continue to head the list of the nation's most affluent metropolitan areas at the beginning of the 1990s, says Sales &amp; Marketing Management magazine. 
The magazine's annual Survey of Buying Power says Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, Conn., will have an average household income in 1990 of $71,628, the highest of any U.S. metro area. 
That's a 41% increase over the Connecticut area's income level in 1985. 

   No. 2 on the magazine's list is Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., the two counties that comprise Long Island, with estimated 1990 average income of $67,595. 
Third is Lake County, Ill., near Chicago, at $66,111. 

   Now brace yourself. 
The fourth most-affluent community on the magazine's list is in North Dakota. 
Grand Forks, N.D., home of the University of North Dakota, a major Air Force base, and some of the nation's richest farming country, will have average household income in 1990 of $63,231, according to the survey. 
Washington, D.C., is the magazine's projected No. 5 at $62,273. 

   Grand Forks residents are perplexed to learn they're so well off. (The magazine survey puts the area's 1985 average income at $41,988.) 
Bob Bushfield, Grand Forks planning director, says the Pentagon pumps in lots of money to support strategic bombers and missiles, and he notes that local farmers, with well-diversified crops, have largely escaped the agricultural recession. 
But he adds, "If you were to come out here, you wouldn't think we're going to be No. 4, I'll tell you that." 

   Robert Korvach, a University of North Dakota economics professor, says the local economy is barely holding its own, with nothing in sight to justify a personal-income boom. 
"I have absolutely no faith in their methodology," he says of the income survey. 
The high rank for Grand Forks is "a statistical aberration." 

   Not so, replies Robert Katz, senior vice president for market statistics at Bill Communications Inc., New York, compiler of the metro income figures. 
He says the survey, which is widely quoted in the sales and marketing industries, uses Census, Internal Revenue Service, and state-government data to rank local areas. 

   Mr. Katz notes, for example, that a handful of wealthy people in a small population center such as Grand Forks can significantly push up the average income figure. 
Eliminate the wealth bias by using a median income figure -- the middle point among incomes of all households in the area -- and Grand Forks still doesn't look too shabby. 
Current median income there is $29,483, which puts the North Dakota town 31st among 317 U.S. metro areas. 

   "We have a lot of consistent evidence indicating that Grand Forks is quite a wealthy area and will continue to be one based on trends we've seen for the past five years," Mr. Katz says.

   GM'S MIDWEST PLANT CLOSINGS may not hurt local government credit ratings after all. 
Since last fall, when General Motors Corp. announced the phased shutdown of nine assembly lines in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has been calculating the impact of the closings on the creditworthiness of the affected states, counties and cities. 

   "The impact isn't as severe as we anticipated it might be," says Peter D'Erchia, an S&amp;P vice president. 
"At this point in our analysis, nobody is impacted severely enough to warrant a rating change." 
The relocation of certain jobs in the same area, and the fact that layoffs aren't coming all at once, make the closings somewhat easier for localities to swallow, he says. 

   A credit-rating downgrade translates into higher borrowing costs when a government raises money in the municipal bond market. 
In addition to the four states, S&amp;P has been looking at the bond ratings of Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Detroit, plus five other Michigan localities, in connection with the GM closings.

   WATCHING THE MOVING VANS is one way to get a feel for interstate migration. 
Chicago-based Allied Van Lines Inc. ranks state-by-state migration based on the company's 160,000 household moves nationwide. 
Last year, Allied counted 14 "magnet" states, its term for a state where 55% or more of the company's residential moves are inbound. 

   The top magnet areas in 1986 were Hawaii, Alaska, District of Columbia, Georgia, Arizona and Rhode Island. 
Nearly three-fourths of Allied's Hawaii business consisted of moves to the islands. 
Allied also counts states where there's a marked exodus. 
For the third year in a row, North Dakota had the highest percentage of Allied's outbound moves. 
Other states with a high share of outbound households were Iowa, Wyoming, Louisiana and West Virginia.

The University of Nevada, Reno, has the nation's only Basque studies program, a legacy of the Basque sheep-herding community that helped pioneer the state. 
Other uncommon languages taught at Western universities include Burmese at the University of Hawaii; Uzbek at the University of California at Los Angeles; Irish Gaelic at Stanford University, and Welsh at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. 
The language inventory is included in a catalog of foreign studies programs at Western colleges published by the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, Boulder, Colo.

      Benefits of Moving Firm
   To Suburbs Narrowing
   ARE YOU WEARY of your company's downtown office site? 
Do you long for space in one of those glitzy suburban office parks? 
How about another city altogether? 

   Metropolitan Consulting Group, New York, calculated the annual office costs for 10 major cities and their suburbs. 
The study's typical company has 300 workers in various pay scales, leases 60,000 square feet of space and serves a national market. 

   Rather than rely on commercial real-estate asking prices, the consultants analyzed several recent office deals in each location to pick up inducements offered by landlords. 
The figures also include taxes, utilities, and executive travel costs. 

   The suburbs are often better buys, says L. Clinton Hoch, Metropolitan's chairman, but the differentials are narrowing and soon may not offset the expense of moving. 
"If you're in downtown Atlanta, you can't justify moving out to the suburbs," he says.

   Study Shows Uncle Sam
   Favors New England
   STATES AND REGIONS are forever arguing whether the federal government plays geographic favorites when it comes to spreading around money. A new survey of government spending shows New England getting the biggest slice of the federal dollar pie and the Great Lakes states getting the smallest piece.
   The analysis, by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, covers the range of federal largesse: government worker salaries, payments to defense contractors, grants to local governments for projects such as highways and sewers, farm subsidies and individual benefits, including Social Security, welfare, food stamps and Medicaid.
   The commission says that, on average, for every $1 spent on these federal programs in the U.S. in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1986, $1.17 was spent in the six New England states. In the mid-Atlantic states, the average was $1.10, largely on the strength of the government establishment in Washington, D.C. The Far West brought in an average of $1.10, the Great Plains $1.04, and the Rocky Mountains $1.01.
   Meanwhile, the Great Lakes states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin got just 81 cents, compared with the $1 national average. The Southeast received 98 cents, and the Southwest got 92 cents.
   States Team Up to Win
   Big in Lottery Returns
   MULTISTATE lotteries are catching the attention of state governments. When states join forces in a single lottery game, jackpots tend to soar, ticket-sales skyrocket, and state revenues increase.
   Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont already run a game called Tristate Megabucks. And making its debut this Saturday is Lotto America, a lottery linking Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia -- which have a combined population of 16.5 million.
   Players in Pawtucket, R.I., and Portland, Ore., can buy a $1 Lotto America ticket and compete for the same weekly grand prize, which starts at $2 million and goes up fast if no one wins. Drawings will be every Saturday night in Des Moines, Iowa. Grand-prize odds are 18 million to one.
   Lotto America tried to sign up New York and Illinois, which would have produced even bigger jackpots. The two states flirted with joining, but both backed out when New York's legislature failed to give its permission.
   New York's lottery director, John Quinn, now says he's interested in setting up a rival multistate game with three other states: Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Their combined population of 49.2 million would produce the richest lottery jackpots in the U.S. by far.
   Commerce Department
   And Minnesota Team Up
   MINNESOTA statistical buffs will have a field day with a 119-page volume just published by the U.S. Commerce Department. The book, the first in a proposed series that would include every state, pulls together a wealth of economic, trade and census data about Minnesota. It sells for $12 at the U.S. Government Printing Office.
   The handbook is the first concrete payoff of the Minnesota Initiative -- an attempt to tailor some of the myriad services of the Commerce Department, such as weather forecasting, patents, tourism, export promotion, and economic statistics, to Minnesota's specific needs.
   To improve the accuracy of weather forecasting along the Minnesota-Canada border, another joint project will funnel weather observations from three small northern Minnesota airfields into the National Weather Service's meteorological data bank, starting this summer.
   The other projects include compiling a gross state product for Minnesota, building an international-trade computer model for a Minnesota industry, and creating a computer bulletin board that lists federal services.

   California leads the nation in farm income,
but when the states are rated in terms of dollars earned per acre,
none comes close to Rhode Island.
   A new analysis by the Agriculture Department for 1987 earnings
said California's net farm income was more than $5.58 billion.
Rhode Island was reported in 47th place at $46.4 million. Alaska
was at the bottom with $14.9 million.
   But the comprehensive Agricultural Income and Finance report,
which was issued this week by the department's Economic Research
Service, also ranked the 50 states according to average net farm
income per acre.
   Rhode Island was at the top, averaging $636 per acre in 1987.
California was seventh at $174 per acre. And Rhode Island's
per-acre average income was almost double second-place Connecticut,
which was reported at $352 per acre.
   Wyoming was ranked 50th with an average net income of $2 per
acre in 1987, the report said. Nationally, the average was a net
income of $46 per acre.
   California also led in net income per farm _ ranches included _
in 1987, averaging $73,790 per operation. Arizona was second at
$71,492 per farm, although the state placed 30th in total net
income last year. Rhode Island was third at $61,924 per farm.
Nationally, the average was $21,286 per farm.
   ``Especially high net farm income per operation or acre reflects
high-valued or relatively perishable crop usually produced near
large metropolitan areas,'' the report said. ``Conversely, low net
income per operation or acre typically occurs where farms are
isolated or produce farm products which require a great deal of
land.''
   Rhode Island had approximately 750 farms averaging 97 acres
each, the report said. In contrast, last-place Wyoming had about
8,800 farms averaging 1,700 acres.
   ``The leading commodities for Rhode Island were greenhouse,
dairy products, eggs and potatoes,'' the report said. ``Such
high-value, labor and capital intensive products tend to be typical
of more populate states with small farms.''
   Rhode Island's four leading commodities accounted for 65 percent
of the state's total 1987 farm marketings. The value of
California's four leading commodities _ dairy products, cattle,
greenhouse and grapes _ accounted for 41 percent of total farm
marketings, by comparison.
   ``The mix of land, labor and capital resources required for
California's leading commodities is indicative of larger farms
compared to those in Rhode Island,'' the report said.
   Here are the 1987 state rankings, in order, for net farm income
per acre, in dollars per acre in the first column; the second
column shows the average net income per farm in those states:

   Tobacco farmers have a bigger harvest this
year, but old-crop inventories are smaller, meaning there will be a
reduced total supply in the 1988-89 marketing year, the Agriculture
Department says.
   ``Stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 2.85
billion pounds, about 14 percent lower than a year earlier,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday in a new
outlook report. ``Although surpluses continue for some kinds and
grades, there are shortages for others.''
   Nationally, the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from
last year because of increased acreage and greater yields, due to
better weather for flue-cured and some other kinds of tobacco.
However, dry weather kept burley yields below normal, but those
still were up from last year's low levels.
   ``Prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small
increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured
tobacco,'' the report said. ``U.S. tobacco use may increase from
1987-88's 1.66 billion pounds because of greater use of
domestically grown tobacco in U.S. cigarettes and higher cigarette
production.''
   The report said U.S. cigarette output this year is expected to
increase from 689 billion ``pieces'' in 1987 because of rising
exports.
   However, cigarette consumption among Americans 18 years and
older is expected to continue a long-term decline, dropping around
1.5 percent this year from an average of 3,196 cigarettes in 1987,
which was the lowest since World War II. Cigarette use peaked at
4,345 pieces _ about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each _ in 1963.
   The cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and
non-smokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year
to year.
   Flue-cured sales began July 26, and by Sept. 15 growers had sold
nearly three-fifths of their anticipated 1988 marketings, the
report said. Even with the larger crop, market prices are near last
year's higher prices, averaging $1.545 a pound, less than half a
percent below the 1987 level.
   As of September, this year's flue-cured crop was estimated at
780 million pounds, up 13 percent from last year.
   This year's burley production is expected to be up 7 percent
from the small 1987 harvest and was estimated earlier this month at
449 million pounds.

<TEXT>
   Up to 40,000 anti-abortion demonstrators turned
out for a peaceful rally in downtown St. Louis on Sunday, police
said.
   Lt. Roy Miller said the demonstrators, who rallied at Kiener
Plaza after marching several blocks, gathered without incident and
no arrests were made.
   ``There were no physical confrontations,'' Miller said. ``Their
adversaries were giving a few catcalls and such but that's about
it.''
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally ever in St.
Louis. Miller said the crowd was estimated at 40,000, but several
police officers at the scene, as well as pro-choice supporters,
disagreed. They said only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were
on hand.
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court heard arguments in a Missouri abortion case which
could be used to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized the procedure in 1973.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in
the case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly funded hospitals and by forbidding the use of
public funds.
   Loretto Wagner of Missouri Citizens for Life said rally
organizers hoped to impress the Supreme Court with the number of
people who attended.
   ``This is a Missouri rally of proud Missourians hoping and
praying that the Missouri case will bring down the curtain on this
sad era in our country's history,'' she said.
   Among those addressing the crowd was Janet Ashcroft, the wife of
Republican Gov. John Ashcroft, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
Danforth said that if Roe vs. Wade was overturned, the power to
dictate abortion law would return to the state legislatures, and
ultimately to the voters.
   The rally was sponsored by Missouri Citizens for Life, along
with the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee, the Christian Action
Council and Clergy for Life.

   Population Drain Ends 

   For Midwestern States 

   IOWA IS MAKING a comeback. 
So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. 
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s. 

   The gains, to be sure, are rather small. 
Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the Census Bureau says. 
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since 1981. 

   Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin. 

   The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race. 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s. 
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 

   At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround. 
Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska. 

   Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue. 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing. 

   More Elderly Maintain 

   Their Independence 

   THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. 
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. 
A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970. 

   This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. 
That share has remained at about 24% since 1970. 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. 
In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970. 

   As people get even older, many become widowed. 
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to 40% in 1988 from 38% in 1970. 

   Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. 
Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970. 

   The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%. 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially. 

   Careers Count Most 

   For the Well-to-Do 

   MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family. 

   At least that's what a survey by Ernst &amp; Young and Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman indicates. 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group. 

   Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. 
Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000. 

   The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class. 
Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 

   Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive. 

   Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it. 
Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off. 

   Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. 
About 40% don't feel they're more able than others. 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only 25% give $2,500 or more to charity each year. 

   Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, 60% feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978. 
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from 33% in 1978. 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%. . . . 
Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 in 1987. 
Per capita personal income ranged from $11,116 in Mississippi to $23,059 in Connecticut. . . . 
There are 13.1 million students in college this fall, up 2% from 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates. 
About 54% are women, and 44% are part-time students.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of the
third day of the Republican National Convention:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE NOMINATION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush moved toward uncontested nomination at the
Republican National Convention, promising that he and newly minted
running mate Dan Quayle would work like a ``couple of pit bulls''
to whip the Democrats this fall.
   Campaign officials waited backstage for their cue to release
50,000 balloons from the Superdome ceiling in celebration.
``Bush-Quayle'' buttons sprouted on the lapels of delegates while
the vice president pronounced his 41-year-old political partner one
of the ``rising young stars'' of the GOP. But qualified, he quickly
added, to be ``one heartbeat away'' from the presidency.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BUSH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush planned to stay in his hotel suite and watch on television
when the Republican National Convention formally delivered him the
party's nomination. He had no opposition. Aides said Barbara Bush
would be in the Superdome, watching the roll call with Indiana Sen.
Dan Quayle, Bush's choice for the vice presidential nomination.
   Bush, seeking to match the warm family images of the Democratic
convention, said he would show off three generations of Bushes when
he accepts the Republican presidential nomination. ``I get my
strength from my family,'' he declared.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>QUAYLE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Quayle, soon to be the Republican vice presidential nominee,
began to tell his story to the nation's voters, but he was
immediately bombarded with questions about his wealth, his military
record and his private life.
   At the first news conference with running mate George Bush,
Quayle denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson in 1980: ``There's nothing to
it.' The Indiana senator angrily dismissed as ``a cheap shot'' any
suggestions that he joined the National Guard in 1969 in order to
avoid going to Vietnam. And Quayle also knocked down reports of a
personal fortune as great as $200 million, pledging to disclose all
his holdings fully.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SELECTION PROCESS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush made extensive notes on potential running mates on legal
pads and reviewed them closely last weekend before making his final
choice of Quayle, aides said. Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller,
also disclosed for the first time the complete list of 11 also-rans.
   They included Sen. Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John Danforth of
Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
Rep. Jack Kemp, and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>IMAGE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the convention say Bush should step out from
President Reagan's shadow and ``come out of the chutes raising
hell'' to capture the White House. Some delegates believe Bush must
sharpen his image to succeed, with the advice ranging from
declaring his independence from President Reagan to using fewer
hand gestures, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and standing straight.
Others prefer that Bush ignore the suggestions and be himself.
   Although Bush cited Quayle's ``strong appeal'' to women in
introducing his choice for a running mate, analysts of the
Republicans' gender gap problem say youthful good looks won't be
enough to attract women's votes. ``It appears like the Republicans
are attempting to woo the women's vote rather than win it,'' said
Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's Campaign Fund, the
largest women's political action committee.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BABY BOOM</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush strategists portray the selection of Quayle as his running
mate as a bold bid for the nation's younger generation, but
analysts warn that as a voting bloc, the baby boom could prove a
bust. The problem is that the nation's roughly 75 million baby
boomers make up too large a segment of the population to fit into
one ideological category, experts said. Generational links do not
necessarily mean shared politics. ``They're such large share of the
American population, they cross all income, occupational and
ideological lines,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>QUAYLE IMPACT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the initial surprise over the selection of Quayle as Bush's
running mate wore off, questions were raised about just what the
second-term senator brings to the Republican ticket.
   Bush and his aides argue that the 41-year-old Indiana senator,
as a member of the huge post-World War II generation, will be a
beacon toward the future for young American voters. They also say
he will attract votes in the Midwest, hit hard by farm woes. But
Quayle is unknown outside his native state, a blank slate for
voters that the GOP and the Democrats alike will rush to write on.
And that clearly worried Republican leaders.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FARM VOTE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A string of Republican luminaries from certain nominee Bush on
down ridiculed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' farm policies,
the day after ``a son of the Midwest'' was picked for the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket.
   Bush, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng took aim at a ``Belgian endive'' comment
that's dogged Dukakis since the early days of the campaign. Dukakis
got in trouble when he suggested that farmers could diversify their
crops, in part by growing Belgian endive. ``I don't think that
Belgian endive is the answer to American agriculture,'' Bush said.

   WASHINGTON -- The overall U.S. population became
significantly less white and Anglo-Saxon during the 1980s,
largely because of growth in the number of Hispanics and
Asians living in this country, according to the 1990 census.
   The proportion of U.S. residents identifying themselves as
white declined to 80.3% in 1990 from 83.1% in 1980. At the
same time, the proportion of Hispanics increased to 9% in
1990 from 6.4% in 1980. Roughly half of those who identified
themselves as Hispanic, the most rapidly growing minority
group, also identified themselves as white. Asians and
Pacific Islanders grew to 2.9% of the population from 1.5% 10
years ago.

   In addition, blacks became a slightly larger segment of
the U.S. population, increasing to 12.1% in 1990 from 11.7%
in 1980, and Native Americans grew to 0.8% from 0.6%.
Although still an overwhelming majority in the U.S., whites
have shrunk as a proportion of the population from 90% in
1960.
   Among Hispanics, the largest group remains people of
Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans. But the
census numbers suggest that a sizable migration of Central
and South Americans is under way. Between 1980 and 1990, the
number of people identifying themselves as "other Hispanic,"
a group largely from Central and South America, increased by
two-thirds. They now represent 2% of the population.
   People of Chinese descent remain the largest element in
the growing U.S. population of Asians and Pacific Islanders,
followed by those of Philippine and Japanese origins. In
addition, the census found significant growth among certain
groups from Asia -- especially the Hmong, who are from
mountainous regions of Laos, and people from Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Emigres from Southeast Asia and the
Asian subcontinent have been arriving in significant numbers,
but they don't yet represent a large portion of the overall
population.
   Minority groups remain unevenly distributed around the
U.S., with Asians and Hispanics concentrated in the West,
blacks and Cuban-Americans concentrated in the South, and
Puerto Ricans concentrated in the Northeast. More recent
arrivals, however, appear to be dispersed less predictably.
According to Jesus Garcia, a census statistician, growth in
the "other Hispanic" category was evenly divided among the
Northeast, the South and the West, though it was slower in
the Midwest.
   In addition, people of Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Rican
origin are more widely dispersed than in the past. The number
of people of Puerto Rican origin living in Nevada and
Georgia, for example, more than doubled in the last decade.
   "When a group gets larger, it simply cannot concentrate
the way it used to," said Marty Riche, director of policy
studies for the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau.
   Among Asians, those of Hmong descent were most numerous in
California, Minnesota and Wisconsin, while those of Pakistani
descent were found principally in New York, California and
Illinois.

<HEAD>Half Of US School Children Are Free Of Tooth Decay, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half of America's 43 million school-age
children have never experienced tooth decay, a dental problem that
affected almost all of America's youth just a generation ago,
according to a federal study released Tuesday.
   In a study that included the oral examination of about 40,000
youngsters coast-to-coast, the National Institute of Dental
Research found that dental cavities have declined by 36 percent
among children ages 5 to 17, and that 49.9 percent of these
children had no tooth decay at all.
   Officials said the sample population examined was selected to
represent the approximately 43 million school-aged children in the
nation.
   Dr. James P. Carlos, chief of the epidemiology at the NIDR, said
that dental decay, a problem that has plagued humankind throughout
history, has been steadily declining since the use of fluoride
became widespread and that the trend probably will continue.
   ``This disease, which is probably the most chronic disease of
childhood, is being decreased very fast,'' said Carlos. ``It is
declining 35 to 36 percent every seven years and now half of the
children in the country have never even experienced dental decay.''
   Carlos said the decline in tooth decay follows a pattern
consistent with the increased use of fluoride in the nation's
drinking water, in toothpastes, and in mouth washes.
   He said the increased use of a dental sealant also has affected
the decline in tooth decay. The sealant is a plastic material that
dentists paint on the chewing surfaces to protect teeth from decay.
   For the survey, specialists counted the amount of decay or
fillings noted on each of the 128 surfaces of a typical set of 28
teeth in the school children. A missing tooth was counted as five
surfaces. Wisdom teeth were not counted since few school children
have them.
   The result showed that the statistical mean of tooth surfaces
with decay was 3.07 per child. The mean in a survey taken in 1980
was 4.77, reflecting a 36 percent decline in tooth cavities.
   In 1980, the survey found that 36.6 percent of the children were
free of tooth decay. This compares to almost half, 49.9 percent,
found without decay in the recent survey.
   Carlos said no similar surveys were taken prior to the 1980
finding, but experts estimate that the only 28 percent of the
school children in the 1970s were without tooth decay, and that a
generation earlier virtually every child experienced some tooth
decay between age 5 and 17.
   He said in the 1940s, it was estimated that U.S. school children
averaged seven teeth each that were decayed, missing or filled.
   Now, instead of counting teeth, he said, the survey must count
surfaces affected in order to get a meaningful statistic.
   Carlos said school children in the Southwest, which includes
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado, showed the least amount of
tooth decay with a mean of 2.4 tooth surfaces affected per child.
That region showed a mean of 3.4 in 1980.
   The New England states _ Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island _ showed the highest
rate, with an mean of 3.6, compared to a mean of 6.1 in 1980.
   Other regional findings, with the mean number of tooth surfaces
per child affected and the same mean from the 1980 survey in
parenthesis, are:
   Northeast (New York, Pennsylania, New Jersey): 3.4 (5.4).
   Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Missouri,
Illionis, Indiana, Ohio): 2.9 (4.7).
   Southeast (Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana): 3.1 (4.6).
   Pacific (Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and California): 3.4
(5.1).
   Northwest (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah): 2.8 (4.4).
   Carlos said the reason for the regional difference ``has never
been satisfactorily explained and is one of the enduring mysteries
of dental epidemiology.''
   At one time, he said experts thought that the varying amounts of
fluoride in the drinking water of the national regions accounted
for the differences, but that has now been discounted because
fluoride is presence in about 60 percent of the water systems in
the nation.
   Dr. Preston A. Littleton Jr., deputy director of NIDR, said the
decline in childhood dental decay will make it possible for the
agency to concentrate more of its research efforts toward dental
problems experienced among adults and older Americans.
   ``The results give us the opportunity to redeploy efforts and
attempt to make similar gains among the older population,'' said
Littleton.

<HEAD>The 1990 Census: What Will it Find?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``So, tell me about yourself,'' the Census
Bureau is about to ask Americans, a bit like an eager young man in
a singles bar.
   Both suitor and statistician think they already know some of the
answers. But, inevitably, both will hear things they didn't expect.
   ``There were some surprises in 1980 and we also expect some
surprises in 1990,'' says William P. Butz, associate director of
the Census Bureau.
   ``There are things we think are happening but, come the '90
census, we'll find that some of that is wrong,'' Butz acknowledges.
   What surprises are likely?
   With Census Day set for April 1, and months of effort to follow
in compiling and analyzing the numbers, Butz says simply, ``I don't
know yet.''
   While the Census Bureau takes a national head count only once
every 10 years, it is constantly taking sample surveys and has a
pretty good idea of what's going on with the nation's
quarter-billion people.
   The 1990 census will find not only a bigger population than in
1980, but one that is different in many ways. Americans are older,
live in different places, have a larger ethnic component and have
changed socially and economically in the last decade.
   Anticipating what the April count will find, here's a look at
the Census Bureau's most recent estimates:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW MANY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. population was estimated at 249.6 million as of Jan. 1
and should be close to 250 million by April 1, up from 226.5
million in 1980.
   The first census, in 1790, counted 3.9 million people. That's
just slightly more than now live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanics now make a big dent in America's consciousness, having
increased to more than 20 million people as they flooded into the
country in recent years.
   Hispanics now account for 8.4 percent of the population, up from
6.4 percent in the 1980 census.
   That means Hispanics are growing faster than the general
population.
   ``Immigration accounted for about half of the overall gain,''
said Carmen DeNavas of the Census Bureau. ``Since 1982 the Central
and South American population here has grown 67 percent.''
   The location and characteristics of immigrants will be of
interest this time, Butz said.
   In 1980 the bureau was surprised at the lack of education among
Haitian immigrants, for example, and it located some unexpected
pockets of new arrivals.
   The nation's racial breakdown also is changing.
   In 1980, 85.9 percent of Americans were white, 11.7 percent were
black and 2.3 percent were Asian or members of other races.
Estimates for 1990 anticipate the white share will be down to 84.2
percent, with blacks up to 12.4 percent and Asians and others
rising to 3.4 percent.
   The 1980s appear to be the first decade in at least 100 years
when more blacks moved to the South than left it, and the census
hopes to learn more about that trend, Butz said.
   Getting an accurate county of minorities is an important effort
this time, since studies of the 1980 census concluded blacks were
missed more often than whites.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FAMILIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Families including a married couple account for just 56 percent
of all households, down from 61 percent in 1980 and 70 percent in
1970, reflecting the growth in single people and one-parent
families.
   Family size also has been declining as people have fewer
children. In 1980 there were 79 youths aged 18 and under for every
100 families. By 1989 that was down to 69.
   The 1990 count may find the decline in childbearing is easing,
however, as women who put off having families to complete schooling
and start careers decide to have children.
   ``We are seeing significant changes in the number of women in
their 30s having children. Women are postponing their first births
and opting for more education and more time in the labor force,''
says Amara Bachu, a Census Bureau statistician.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STEPCHILDREN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The growth of single-parent families stemming from divorce also
has allowed for more remarriages. Hence, the number of stepchildren
grew to 6.8 million by 1985, up 15 percent from 1980. It it
expected to prove even higher in 1990.
   Historically there have been far fewer children in one-parent
homes, with more of those children in homes headed by a widowed,
rather than divorced, parent, says Arlene Saluter of the Census
Bureau.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WIVES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wives' earnings were increasing at twice the rate of husbands'
in the 1980s. But wives still earn half of what their husbands
bring home.
   From 1980 to 1987, wives' earnings rose 23 percent, compared to
a 12 percent growth for their husbands. But wives still averaged
$13,250, compared to $29,150 for their husbands.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHERE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's center of population is continuing it's trek south
and west. The mythical point where the nation could balance if
everyone weighed the same crossed the Mississippi River in 1980,
winding up in Missouri.
   Since then the Sun Belt states have continued to lead the nation
in growth. In the 1980s, California added 4 million people, the
most of any state. Indeed, California, Texas and Florida accounted
for half the national growth in the decade.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW OLD</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation continues to age as the giant post-World War II baby
boom generation matures.
   The median age of the United States hit 30 in 1980, grew to 32.1
by 1987 and will be even higher when the 1990 count is complete.
Median means that half of all Americans are older than that age and
half younger.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CITIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In addition to moving to the South and the West, Americans have
been concentrating growth in metropolitan areas in the 1980s, in
contrast to the 1970s, when rural areas experienced a boom.
   The result has been city growth in the Sun Belt, with places
such as San Diego, Jacksonville, Fla., and San Jose, Calif., moving
up the list of biggest cities.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EDUCATION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are better educated than ever before, thanks largely
to the educational efforts of the baby boom generation.
   The 1990 census is expected to show 77.7 percent of men and 76.9
percent of women aged 25 and over have completed high school and
21.9 percent of men and 15.6 percent of women are college
graduates, American Demographics magazine says.
   By contrast, in 1980, 67.7 percent of men were high school grads
and 20.3 percent had finished college. For women, the 66.2 percent
had finished high school and 12.9 percent held college degrees.
   But those gains may not continue.
   ``Men aged 25 to 34 are now less likely to have completed
college than were the baby boomers ten years ago. The high cost of
education may be pushing young adults out of college and into the
workforce,'' say researchers Judith Waldrop and Thomas Exter.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOMELESS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 census will count people ``in shelters, on the streets
and in halfway houses,'' says the bureau's Peter Bounpane. With
estimates of the number of homeless ranging from 300,000 to 2
million, the bureau hopes to prodice a reasonably accurate estimate
of these people for the first time.

PERSISTENT DROUGHT PLAGUES MIDWEST FOR A SECOND YEAR 
</P>

Drought and drought-related pestilence are threatening large portions of 
America's desiccated heartland, now in its peak growing season but still 
thirsting for relief from the drought of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Areas deficient in rainfall this year never quite recovered from last summer's 
drought," said Ken Kunkel, director of the Midwestern Climate Center at the 
University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
This year's drought is unlikely to approach either the geographic or economic 
scales of last year's, which was one of the costliest natural disasters in 
American history, driving up food prices and driving down important economic 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1989 drought, building on last year's event, will affect tens of 
thousands of farmers and the economies of Midwestern states from Illinois to 
Kansas and from Missouri to North Dakota. Wide areas of the Southwest and West 
are also being affected by drought this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Here in northwestern Minnesota, swarming grasshoppers in numbers that have only 
been recorded in periods of severe drought are attacking fields of wheat, 
barley, sugar beets and oats. Soon they will move to the corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 60 years old, have been in this business 30 years and I've never seen them 
like this before," said University of Minnesota entomologist David Noetzel. 
"And the real tough part is still two weeks away for us." 
</P>
<P>
Noetzel has counted as many as 1,100 grasshoppers per square yard of ground, 
140 times what is considered normal. Farmers are routinely reporting 400 to 800 
grasshoppers per square yard, 50 to 100 times normal and the biggest 
infestations since the great Dust Bowl droughts a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the grasshoppers is already estimated at $20 million, Noetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, traditionally the nation's biggest producer of feed corn, fields are 
dry as the corn plants enter the critical grain producing phase of their life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"We are short in topsoil moisture over 93% of the state," Dale M. Cochran, 
Iowa's agriculture secretary, said at week's end. And 99% of the state's fields 
have virtually no subsoil moisture vital to sustain corn plants that normally 
reach a height of eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
In North Dakota, a major producer of spring wheat and sugar beets, Gov. George 
Sinner declared a drought disaster last week. North Dakota State University 
estimates this year's losses so far at $540 million, about half of what drought 
cost the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wells providing drinking water to more than 100 small towns in Missouri, Kansas 
and Iowa have dried up, reported Donald A. Wilhite, director of the University 
of Nebraska's Center for Agricultural Meteorology and Climatology. 
</P>
<P>
Drought in Colorado has not only made conditions ripe for wildfires but also is 
driving black bears from their rugged mountain homes into the populated 
foothills around Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dutch Elm Disease 
</P>
<P>
Botanists in the suburbs of Chicago have reported the worst outbreak of deadly 
Dutch elm disease in 15 years as infected beetles prey on drought-weakened elm 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
Even farmers in Nebraska who used irrigation to escape the full thrust of last 
summer's drought are being affected this year because, unlike 1988, they began 
the 1989 growing season with fields that had virtually no stored moisture. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year people in the state were saying, 'What drought?' " said Wilhite. 
"This year they had the driest March on record for much of Nebraska. In 
two-thirds of the state rainfall was only 50% of normal. April was about the 
same. In May about half the state had only 10% of its normal rain and much of 
the rest of the state had only 50% of normal rainfall. Those three months were 
just devastating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Crop Losses 
</P>
<P>
Drought losses to the winter wheat crop in Kansas this spring are now estimated 
at close to $1 billion and may be larger when the harvest is completed in the 
next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is already at work on disaster legislation to help farmers hurt both 
by drought and by floods that affected farms in the East, South and Southeast. 
Last year farmers received close to $3 billion in government drought aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insecticide Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Legislature -- aware that grasshoppers thrive in drought because 
it eliminates the moisture-fed diseases and fungus that control them -- this 
year approved a controversial law requiring farmers to control locusts. If they 
refuse, local governments have the power to spray insecticides and to add the 
cost of spraying to a farmer's annual tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was opposed by environmentalists who claimed spraying could 
harm wildlife and other beneficial insects, such as bees. Organic farmers, who 
use no chemicals on their crops, opposed it -- as did farmers who have agreed 
to take their land out of production for 10 years in exchange for a relatively 
small annual payment from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harsh Words' 
</P>
<P>
Clashes have erupted between farmers who want the bugs sprayed and those 
opposed to the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no violence, just a lot of harsh words," said Paul Anderson, a 
farmer in Warren, a member of the Marshall Township board and the township 
clerk. "It gets to be neighbor against neighbor. Usually it takes (a conflict 
over) water to create this kind of problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Most farmers want to spray," said Eldor Omdahl, 79, a retired farmer who has 
refused to spray. Omdahl donated 640 acres of his land in nearby Polk County to 
the Audubon Society for a bird and wildlife sanctuary, and spraying, he said, 
threatens the animals and birds. The remainder of his land is in the government 
reserve program and has no crops on it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of tension there. We don't know who will make the first move," 
said Omdahl, standing near his garden that has been largely eaten by 
grasshoppers. "They wanted my brother to spray and he ordered them off his 
land. It's a destructive situation. You have township officials administering 
the law and they are all biased farmers. . . . We didn't know anything about 
the law until the grasshoppers came. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cost issue with me," Omdahl added. "One of the reasons I put it in the 
(federal reserve) is for the money. But I like to protect wildlife. That's why 
I gave it to Audubon."

<TEXT>
   Hispanic and black women, women with low
incomes, those living with someone they are not married to, and
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions
than women in general, according to a private survey.
   Firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions
performed each year nor on who has them. Moreover, the survey by
The Alan Guttmacher Institute confirms that most abortions are
performed on white, middle-class women because they make up the
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age.
   However, the extensive survey by the New York-based, non-profit
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of
abortions relative to their raw numbers.
   For example, it found that nonwhite women make up 16.7 percent
of the childbearing-age population, but accounted for 31.4 percent
of the abortions.
   White women accounted for 68.6 percent of those seeking
abortions, but 83.3 percent of the childbearing-age population,
considered 15-to-44 for purposes of the survey.
   And it found that women with family incomes below $11,000
accounted for 33.1 percent of those receiving abortions although
they made up only 29.2 percent of all women of childbearing age.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates
there were 1,328,000 abortions in the United States in 1985, the
most recent year for which it has numbers. The Guttmacher Institute
estimates 1,588,550 that year.
   No one questions that the number has increased since the Supreme
Court legalized abortion in 1973. The court is hearing arguments
April 26 in a Missouri case that both sides agree could result in
the reversal, or weakening of that landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.
   The Guttmacher Institute surveyed 9,480 women who obtained
abortions at hospitals, clinics or doctors offices during 1987 in
an effort to find out who was obtaining the services.
   It selected 103 facilities in what was intended as a
statistically valid national sample base _ 21 hospitals and 82
clinics and physicians' offices _ and arranged for questionnaires
to be given to the 11,313 women who showed up for abortions during
a 12-day period.
   Although filling out and mailing in the questionnaire was
voluntary and done anonymously and privately by the woman, a large
number _ 9,480 _ returned completed questionnaires.
   Although no specific margin of error was given, the large sample
base lends credibility to the statistical profile of U.S. women
seeking abortions during that particular period in 1987.
   Unmarried women living with a man constituted 17.4 percent of
the abortion clients although they made up only 3.4 of all
childbearing-age women.
   Women attending school constituted 31.1 percent of those seeking
abortions, but 20.5 percent of all women of childbearing age.
   Most women cited more than one factor in their decision to have
an abortion. Among the reasons were concerns about how motherhood
would change their lives, financial problems, single parenthood,
the responsibility of parenthood, others knowing they were
pregnant, maturity and how many children they already had.

<TEXT>     Unless steps are taken to create more council districts in San Jose, the
gulf between residents and their council representatives will continue to
widen.;   Most of the debate about redistricting has centered on whether and
how to shape districts with majorities of racial and ethnic minority voters.
However, in a final report that fell by the wayside, the city's Redistricting
Review Panel recommended that the council study the creation of additional
districts.;   Although the very thought of creating districts reportedly
produced a chuckle among the council at a recent meeting, it is an idea whose
time has come.;   Since district-based representation began in 1980, the city
has grown by nearly 200,000 people, while the number of districts has remained
frozen at 10. After the next election, each council member will represent
nearly 80,000 people. (The exact number is unknown because of the presumed
census undercount.) Thus, the number of residents each member represents has
increased about 20,000.;   Far too many constituents;   Eighty thousand people
is an incredibly large number for an individual to represent. Many state
legislatures have much lower ratios. To be precise, 41 state lower houses
(analogous to the California Assembly) and 22 state senates have lower ratios
of representation than will the city of San Jose in 1992. These include
populous states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Missouri.;   San Jose
also compares poorly with many cities. Each council member in San Jose
represents more individuals than make up the entire population of many other
localities in Santa Clara County. Nationally, 18 cities with populations
between 400,000 and 1 million have an average representation ratio of 60,000
people per representative. Of these cities, only five (Honolulu, San Antonio,
Phoenix, San Diego, and Detroit) have larger ratios than San Jose, while the
remaining 13 have significantly lower ratios. These cities are Long Beach,
Pittsburgh, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Austin, Seattle, Denver,
Cleveland, Boston, Milwaukee, Jacksonville and Baltimore.;   Bigger isn't
better;   The present mega-districts are so large that most residents have
little or no idea what district they live in. Council districts span grossly
disparate neighborhoods and communities of interest.;   There is more to
consider than representation ratios and the workloads of council members.
Perhaps the most important reason to consider increasing the number of
districts is to avoid diluting the voting strength of racial and ethnic
groups. Veterans of the redistricting process know that the massive size and
population of the present districts make it nearly impossible to create
districts with majorities of Latinos and Asian-Americans. Indeed, the present
system tends to force the creation of districts that pit ethnic groups and
other communities of interest against one another.;   The Voting Rights Act
and wise political judgment both militate in favor of a more diverse council.
Aside from one Hispanic and one Asian-American council member who were
appointed to the seats of resigning members and who were later re-elected,
only two Asian or Latino council members have been elected in a city that now
has a minority population of non-Hispanic whites.;   Boost to minority groups;
  The addition of a few more districts, say two or four, would make the
council more representative, less burdened, and more reflective of the city's
ethnic diversity. Additional districts could make a majority Asian
American-Pacific Islander district a possibility -- without irregularly shaped
district lines that divide neighborhoods.;   Apart from incumbents' vested
interest in the present system, the only serious objection to a larger council
would be the additional cost to the city. This cost might be countered by
decreasing the budget of each council member, assuming that constituent
service loads would decrease. Generally speaking, however, the increased cost
would be negligible in comparison to the city's overall spending. In any
event, the investment in democracy is worth making.;   Increasing the number
of districts would involve a change in the charter, and thus approval by the
electorate. The council is about to consider placing on an upcoming ballot a
charter amendment to improve the redistricting process. The council should
take the opportunity also to improve the quality of representation by making
increased districts a part of any charter adjustment.;   Engines for change;  
But assuming that the council is not inclined to lead the city toward such an
amendment, what might supply the impetus for change?;   First, a petition
drive among those who stand to benefit most from better representation might
be successful. Specifically, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, as well as
other communities who feel poorly served by the system, ought to seize the
moment. Second, the mayor's office, which has advocated a more representative
government, ought to provide leadership.;   Given the vast amounts of
political inertia that hogtie participation in San Jose government, action is
unlikely. But the people of San Jose ought to weigh in their own minds whether
it is worth voting for one eighty-thousandth of a pol. (box)  </TEXT>

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE MAIL ROLLS IN: KFAC TO MISSOURI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The columns that draw the most mail never fail to surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the arrogances of columnists that we tend to believe that the 
things that agitate us the most are mirrored by those who read the column. And, 
of course, that often isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
It has been some months since I dealt with letters here, and during that span 
the three columns that drew the most mail were: the demise of KFAC, my 
homecoming visit to the University of Missouri and the narrative of a World War 
II experience that led me to an advertisement in the Nov. 22, 1941, New Yorker 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
What the KFAC mail told me is that someone is missing a bet by not starting a 
classical music station -- or converting an existing one -- in Orange County. 
The audience is large and remarkably faithful. As Elizabeth Thacker of Mission 
Viejo wrote: "KFAC's classical music programs enriched and saved my life. Over 
and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Mae Lambrinch of Huntington Beach noted, "Isn't it ironic that the 
ever-improving quality available in tapes and discs is mostly used for 
mind-shattering, all-sound-alike rock 'n' roll?" 
</P>
<P>
And Rachel May of Santa Ana wrote: "What can we do to get a good classical 
music station back on the air? I am willing to pay a modest amount of money, as 
I'm sure many classical music lovers might also. I would guess the demographics 
of classical music lovers would show them to be a smallish but potentially 
lucrative segment of the population for advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Are any Orange County entrepreneurs out there listening? 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri mail confirmed something I had only suspected: that all of Orange 
County didn't go to USC. Or claim to. 
</P>
<P>
A quite remarkable number of Missouri alums surfaced to share their own 
nostalgia trips with me. Typical was Charles Murry of Huntington Beach, who 
wrote that the ancient brick buildings of the Missouri campus "provide a tonic 
for the soul which the completely functional structures put up since World War 
II on all campuses cannot even approach." 
</P>
<P>
The column about the New Yorker advertisement that ran two weeks before the 
attack on Pearl Harbor and appeared to signal that attack to someone received 
the biggest response. 
</P>
<P>
A large ad and smaller ads inside the issue referred to a game board named "The 
Deadly Double" that was seemingly manufactured by a company that the 
intelligence community later found didn't exist. Eerily, two dice showed the 
numbers 12 and 7, neither of which is found on standard dice. 
</P>
<P>
National Public Radio interviewed me and used a rather sizable segment of the 
interview on the air (in which -- by adroit editing -- they managed to expunge 
every mention of The Times). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mail was fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Marine Corps Capt. Louis Bushnell of Santa Ana, for example, enclosed a 
copy of an ad that appeared a few days before the attack in the Honolulu 
Advertiser. (Bushnell was born and raised in that city.) 
</P>
<P>
It takes a considerable stretch of the imagination to read subversive messages 
into this ad of a silk importing company, but Naval Intelligence apparently 
gave it a great deal of attention before dismissing it. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Preston, a former advertising man who now lives in Huntington Beach, 
completed an intriguingly detailed analysis of questions raised by the New 
Yorker ad. For example, how were the seven teaser ads placed so precisely, how 
did the advertiser get island treatment for his one-column ad, why didn't Naval 
Intelligence follow up on the source of the artwork or typography, both of 
which carry distinctive stamps? That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
Preston sent the ad and his letter to nine "much-above-average thinkers" 
(including a mystery writer) and asked them to comment on the puzzle. He has 
promised to deliver the results to me. 
</P>
<P>
The most frustrating mail to report on are the long, thoughtful letters that 
are difficult to excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
I've had two such letters from Ray Bracy of Tustin, the most recent on the 
names of special-interest groups. He concluded: "The voters of Irvine . . . 
have told the world that they believe it is quite all right to have a group of 
second-class citizens. Now, if we can just get those subversives out of the 
schools. . . . You were accurate in calling it McCarthyism brought up to date. 
So where is our Joe Welsh?" 
</P>
<P>
And Sheldon Karlan of Buena Park wrote how in his view the growth of individual 
freedom "has become equated with (moral) decadence," supporting his thesis with 
half a dozen specific examples. 
</P>
<P>
Both letters merit longer treatment than I can give here and will be held as 
the possible subjects of future columns. 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there are the zingers. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hartman of Cypress wrote: "You must be the slob that sits around the TV 
laughing at such off-color shows as 'Married With Children.' You know, just a 
'wide variety of people doing a wide variety of things.' I'll still take a 
little Republican intolerance any day compared to the barnyard society you seem 
to espouse." 
</P>
<P>
And a correspondent who identifies himself only as "Jim" wrote: "Please stop 
trying to protect my civil rights! Myself and many respectable friends have 
functioned well because we know how to act in society. I don't need your 
crusading to tell me what I can and cannot do. You have absolutely no idea what 
the life style of the average gay is outside of Orange County. . . . I feel 
patronized in a way that a black person would when the white liberal admits he 
knows how it is to be black." 
</P>
<P>
Jim thoughtfully told me I could respond in my column, but I'm not sure what 
I'm being accused of here. Offhand, I don't know any white liberals who make 
such claims. We just have this funny feeling that everyone ought to have the 
same rights, including Jim. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the phone calls. I received one the other day from Irmalee 
Desenberg of Corona del Mar, who wants the world to know that good Samaritans 
aren't an extinct breed, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Irmalee and her husband, Bud, were headed for a reunion at Stanford University 
over the holidays when Irmalee went to sleep at the wheel and their car 
miraculously crossed four lanes of opposing traffic on Interstate 5 near 
Bakersfield and turned over. 
</P>
<P>
Even more miraculously, neither of the Desenbergs was badly hurt, but the 
experience was made much less shattering by a young man who stopped immediately 
after the accident and stayed with them throughout the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
He loaded all their possessions in his car, followed the ambulance to the 
hospital, stayed until they were pronounced OK and released, and then drove 
them to Stanford, although he was going only to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Frank Drolep, he works in the Ontario Fire Department, and he's 
unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to find him a good wife," Irmalee said. "It's the least I can do."

FT  10 MAR 92 / Presidential front-runners eager to convince today: Super
Tuesday test for Democrats and Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY all logic, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat, and Mr George
Bush, a Republican and the president, should be smiling tonight. They ought
to win most - in Mr Bush's case all  - the 11 Democratic primaries and
caucuses and eight Republican primaries that mark the heaviest day yet in
election year, now known universally as Super Tuesday.
But elections are not only about simple winners and losers. Especially in
the long primary season, expectations count a lot, which means that for both
front-runners anything less than a series of convincing victories will be
instantly, and perhaps correctly, interpreted as signs of continuing
vulnerability. Super Tuesday, therefore, carries risks as well as rewards.
Mr Bush's problem, unlikely to disappear today, is with the third of
Republican voters who decline to support him in primaries. He has campaigned
heavily in the last two weeks, dispensing presidential largesse almost
everywhere he has been, and is unlikely to lose a single state. His lead in
the delegate count is already overwhelming and he will take almost all the
421 more to be allocated today.
But he could still be embarrassed by Mr Pat Buchanan in the south, for
example in Louisiana, where another right-winger, former Ku Klux Klan man
David Duke, a local son, is also on the ballot; in Mississippi and even in
Texas, which the president calls home; and in the depressed New England
states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
Whatever happens, Mr Buchanan has promised to keep on waging his ideological
warfare, moving to Illinois and Michigan a week from today and, he says, all
the way to the last primary in early June in California, where Mr Bush is
not popular. Sooner or later Mr Buchanan will run out of steam and money but
his continued ability to goad Mr Bush does the president's image little
good. Perhaps for this reason, the president has decided for the moment to
remain in the White House.
On the Democratic side, the stakes for Mr Clinton are even higher today. His
tactically well-planned and well-financed campaign always banked on a big
Super Tuesday, with seven of the 11 state polls being held on his natural
border and southern turf.
He might also be the principal beneficiary of the end yesterday of the
campaign of Tom Harkin, the liberal Senator from Iowa. Mr Harkin yesterday
studiously avoided expressing a preference for any candidate. Organised
labour, Mr Harkin's bulwark, may find the centrist Mr Clinton more amenable
than Mr Paul Tsongas, who favours tax breaks and incentives for business,
and former California governor Jerry Brown, who attacks the political
establishment, of which labour remains a part.
But Mr Clinton still has not established himself as a candidate in whom the
Democratic electorate has great confidence. In part this is because of
questions about his character, raised first in allegations of marital
infidelity and draft evasion and now over his financial relationship as
governor with an Arkansas real estate developer. It also reflects the fact
that the Democratic race has become much nastier.
Mr Tsongas reflected over the weekend that he did not really like negative
political advertising but that has not stopped him attacking Mr Clinton, and
vice versa, and it certainly has not stopped Mr Brown going for both, but
especially Mr Clinton, indiscriminately.
Four years ago, Super Tuesday produced four separate Democratic winners.
This time, most of the 11 races appear to be between Mr Clinton and Mr
Tsongas, but the one which is a real litmus test for Mr Clinton's
credibility is Florida. He can afford losses in Massachusetts, Rhode Island
and Delaware and knows that in several other states Mr Tsongas has barely
campaigned, including Texas, which has most delegates at stake.
But Florida, an ethnic and economic potpourri of Californian dimensions, now
conforms to no stereotype and the Tsongas appeal to the better-educated
white and hispanic middle classes could offset the clear Clinton advantage
in money and organisation in the state. It is worth recalling that another
Greek from Massachusetts, Mr Michael Dukakis, achieved a critical primary
victory there in 1988.
A loss in Florida, or even a narrow victory, would not knock Mr Clinton off
the front-runner's perch, assuming he performs to expectations elsewhere.
But it would make him nervous, to put it mildly, about next week's
confrontations in the big northern industrialised states of Illinois and
Michigan as well as the one in New York on April 7.
For, although he already has a handy lead in the delegate count, the
Democrats are also electing a considerable number who will go the convention
in New York in July committed to no candidate. The prize of an assured first
ballot victory at the convention remains some way off.

REMOTE WOLF POINT RANCHES TRY TO SNARE VISITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE COHEN, Cohen is a free-lance writer living in Durango, Colo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WOLF POINT, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard as it may be to believe, Amtrak does stop here. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 3,074, Wolf Point is also the smallest city in the United 
States offering regularly scheduled, commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
But the rails are the lifeline in this expansive agricultural region known as 
Missouri River Country. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged in by the North Dakota border and Canada to the north, Wolf Point's 
wheat farmers and cattle ranchers might seem an unlikely presence on the 
tourism bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
But in these tough times for America's small farmers, promoting tourism as an 
adjunct to farming is one way Wolf Point and the surrounding communities are 
attempting to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is big out here -- the prairies, the cultivated fields, the sky. 
There are few trees in any direction to break the view. Parents routinely drive 
children 50 miles for a piano lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, long isolated by the sheer size of their properties, usually build a 
spare house or two to accommodate help. Today, with the farm economy down and 
farmers being paid by the government not to grow, these spare homes sit empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help With Chores 
</P>
<P>
Wolf Point isn't a tropical resort, but you can rent a furnished two-bedroom 
house for $150 a week. If you wish, you can help with ranch chores such as 
calving or branding. Or just read a book, take a walk or do nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
This is a part of Montana that few people visit. In Missouri River Country, you 
will be hobnobbing with working people, not polished tour guides, and you'll 
get a glimpse inside the skin of a community that is not exactly the hub of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of remoteness is ever present. You can gaze 100 miles across the 
rolling Missouri River breaks and study the approaching storm clouds. Thunder 
echoes and lightning crackles. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee at the General Sherman Motor Inn -- the town's largest motel -- is 35 
cents. Steak and eggs, with juice, toast and coffee, tops the menu at $4. 
</P>
<P>
So what does one do after breakfast in Wolf Point? 
</P>
<P>
If you are staying in John Rabenberg's $150-a-week furnished spare house, you 
might go flying with your host. He has a private landing strip on his ranch, 
and for a small fee takes passengers for rides. He also can supply motorbikes 
or horses. 
</P>
<P>
Rabenberg's place is only one of more than a dozen cattle, hay or wheat ranches 
in Wolf Point with an extra house for rent.

<HEAD>Thousands of Inmates Head Home on Thanksgiving Furloughs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's business as usual in state prison systems as thousands of
inmates around the nation go home for Thanksgiving. Only a few
states have no furlough provisions, and several are expanding or
adopting such programs.
   ``It's normal business,'' John Perry, spokesman for Vermont's
Department of Corrections, said of prison furloughs. In its inmate
population of 840, about 75 will go home for Thanksgiving.
   Up to 1,000 inmates in North Carolina, 500 in Alabama, 500 in New
York and 300 in Oregon are set to spend Thanksgiving outside prison
walls.
   The numbers are smaller in other systems, but the trend is toward
release despite the presidential-campaign controversy stirred by
President-elect George Bush and, last week, the canceling of
Thanksgiving furloughs for 21 Maryland inmates because of adverse
publicity.
   While some officials concede inmates can abuse such programs,
many insist furloughs are an effective way to relieve prison
overcrowding and prepare inmates for life outside prison. Most
states allow only minimum-security prisoners to leave on furlough,
and many exclude convicted sex offenders.
   During the presidential campaign, Bush repeatedly attacked his
Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, over his
state's furlough program. The Bush campaign often cited the case of
convicted murderer Willie Horton, who raped a woman in Maryland
while on a weekend furlough. The Massachusetts program was changed
in April to make first-degree murderers serving life sentences
ineligible for furloughs.
   Furloughs have ``proven to be productive on a national scale,''
said Tom Powers, who became warden of the North Dakota State
Penitentiary in September. He is allowing 15 prisoners to go home
for Thanksgiving in a new program he calls ``extremely
conservative.''
   The Kansas Department of Correction is developing regulations for
furloughs under a law passed this year.
   In the few states that have no such programs, including Nevada,
California, Illinois and Michigan, prisoners generally are not
allowed out even for family funerals unless they are in handcuffs or
leg irons.
   ``We have no furlough program for anybody to go out overnight.
What we have is emergency releases with inmates in restraints for
funerals, to go to a relative's deathbed or something like that, and
that's it,'' said Nevada Prison Director George Sumner.
   Leo Lalonde, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of
Corrections, said his state has a similar policy. ``We don't have
anything for Thanksgiving or even Christmas. Although we do have the
highest rate of suicide around Christmas.''
   Two states that grant furloughs, Missouri and Arkansas, shy away
from holidays.
   ``We feel like it puts the inmate in a situation where there is
more temptation,'' said David White, Arkansas Correction Department
spokesman.
   ``When the whole society is partying, it's awful hard not to
party yourself,'' said Dale Riley, a spokesman for the Missouri
Department of Corrections and Human Resources, which quit holiday
furloughs three years ago after three prisoners were arrested one
weekend for assault and disorderly conduct. ``We just felt it was
best not to have them out.''
   In North Carolina, prisoners can go home for up to 48 hours in
the custody of a relative, or can get a day off under a community
volunteer program in the custody of someone such as a minister.
   David Guth, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of
Correction, said he had no figures for Thanksgiving Day, but on Nov.
20, for example, 1,368 prisoners were on home or community release
out of a prison population of 17,916. Rapists and murders are not
automatically excluded, he said, but only those in minimum-security
facilities are eligible for furlough.
   ``Do we furlough people that are in for murder? Yes,'' said James
Flateau, spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services in
New York where 8,177 inmates got furloughs last year. ``Probably a
dozen people convicted of ... murder are furloughed each year.''
   In Alabama, passes are granted ``based on the trustworthiness of
the inmate,'' said Debbie Herbert, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Corrections.
   The furlough program in Louisiana, however, has been suspended
for study because a trusty working in the governor's mansion has
been accused of murder while on a weekend pass in August.
   In Maine, with a prison population of 577, there are 20 inmates
going home for Thanksgiving.
   In the 20 years the program has been in effect, one inmate ran a
roadblock and killed a policeman and another inmate committed a
crime, said Warden Martin Magnusson of the Maine State Prison.
   ``If you have 2,000 successes and you have one that isn't a
success, that's the one you hear about,'' Magnusson said.
   Maryland's Patuxent Institution, a rehabilitative
maximum-security prison, canceled Thanksgiving furloughs this week
for 21 inmates after criticism of furloughs granted to convicted
triple-murderer Robert Daly Angell.
   ``The inmates really protect the program,'' said Ed Ligtenberg,
associate warden at the South Dakota Penitentiary, where 18
minimum-security inmates are going home for Thanksgiving. ``It's
good for the inmates because it gradually reintegrates them to the
outside.''

<HEAD>Snowy Owls Gather at Logan International Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds
from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter
home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most
polluted harbors.
   The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and
an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at Logan
International Airport, said Bradford Blodget, of the state Division
of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``Massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire
country to see snowy owls,'' Blodget said. ``Probably the largest
concentration in the state is out at Logan.''
   In addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern
surroundings, the white birds are doing their part to clean up the
much-maligned Boston Harbor by feasting on the water rats populating
the grasslands between the runways and the water.
   More than 35 of the solitary, 20-inch-long, often brown-specked
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water
and runways during their last December-to-March visit.
   Norman Smith, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, banded 36
snowy owls at Logan for the first time last season. The birds, which
travel individually, start their trek south in November and continue
to migrate until January.
   So far this year, Smith has sighted three birds. The small number
could be part of a migratory pattern, or more birds could come as
the season progresses, he said.
   Smith is the state's snowy owl expert, but he concedes it is
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the
tundra in Greenland and northern Canada to the chaotic environment
of the airport.
   ``Nobody really knows why they migrate,'' Smith said. ``Some
people try to correlate it to the drop in the Lemming supply (which
the owls feed on), some try to correlate it to the weather.''
   Smith said he believes it's just a normal migratory pattern that
draws the snowy owls south to the airport, where the noisy planes
don't disturb the birds.
   ``For the most part they ignore them,'' he said. ``Owls have
sensitive hearing, but the jet noise doesn't seem to phase them at
all.''
   The owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would
in the barren expanses of home, with a few extra activities, Smith
said.
   ``They roost primarily on the ground. And they seem to be most
active just before sunset and very active at night,'' Smith said.
   Sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps, buses and structures
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield, and occasionally the
owls venture out to the harbor islands.
   ``In the evenings, I've actually seen them fly to downtown
Boston,'' Smith said, adding that the owls perch on roof tops and
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys.
   Although the noise from the planes doesn't bother the owls, Bob
D'Entremont, an airport employee since 1971 who has watched the
falcons, blue heron and geese that populate Logan, said the airport
is not always safe for the owls _ they often sit on the white lines
of the runways to blend in.
   ``We lose a couple a year. A couple get hit,'' said D'Entremont,
who said he has spotted snowy owls at Logan since 1975.
   Logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the United
States. The birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes
and fields. A large seasonal population can be found at Plum Island
off Newburyport.
   A Logan owl was once tracked to Rhode Island, and John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York reports five or six snowy owls a
year.

      States' Efforts Vary
   In Taxing Residents
   MOST PEOPLE would swear that their home state does a good job of extracting every possible tax dollar from its residents. 
In truth, however, some states are far more aggressive than others in going after tax revenue. 

   "Tax effort" measures how a state exploits its tax base relative to other states. 
"It's what you do with what you have," explains a state-tax expert. 

   Connecticut, for example, has the highest per capita income in the U.S., but it doesn't have a personal income tax. 
New Yorkers also have high income levels, on average, but the state tries to recapture a big chunk of those funds with a stiff income tax. 
Thus, New York has a higher tax effort than Connecticut when it comes to taxing personal income. 

   The Washington-based Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has ranked the states in terms of overall tax effort, using 1985 data. 
It looked at major revenue sources -- sales taxes, property taxes, license fees, user charges, mineral revenues, and personal and business income taxes -- in calculating the size of the burden each state imposes on its tax base. 

   The top 10 in tax effort: New York, District of Columbia, Alaska, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Iowa, Utah and Wyoming. 
New York's tax effort was 56% greater than the U.S. average. 

   Nevada and New Hampshire had the lowest tax-effort scores, 64% below the national norm. 
Other states with comparatively low tax efforts: Florida, Texas, Delaware, Tennessee, Missouri, Oklahoma and Colorado. 

   Study Disputes Union
   On Mexican Border Jobs
   ORGANIZED LABOR has long complained about the bustling manufacturing belt that's sprung up in Northern Mexico. 
Union officials argue that U.S. companies have exported thousands of jobs to factories in the Mexican border cities, taking advantage of that country's 90-cent-an-hour minimum wage. 

   Helping to spur this job migration across the Rio Grande has been a provision in the U.S. tariff code that allows duty-free movement of U.S. products and components into Mexico, as long as those items are integrated into products re-imported to the U.S. 

   Labor has been urging Congress to repeal the tariff provisions as a means of saving jobs in the U.S. Now comes an exhaustive report by the International Trade Commission that says scrapping the tariff breaks would cause scarcely a blip in the U.S. employment picture. 

   It's the huge differential between Mexican and U.S. wages resulting from successive peso devaluations, not favorable tariff consideration, that's currently driving the U.S.-Mexican border economy, the ITC says. 
The commission couldn't find a single U.S. company doing business on the border that said it would return to the U.S. if the tariff provisions were repealed. 

   Repeal of the tariff provisions would likely cost jobs in U.S. factories that have opened to supply components to the Mexican assembly plants, but the overall employment effect in the U.S. "would be small," the ITC says. 
The bulk of these new supplier companies are in Texas. 

   Any movement to repeal the provisions would require action by a trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Says a subcommittee staff member, after reviewing the ITC's findings: "The people who were scared to death about losing their program don't have anything to fear." 

   Retirees Shun Sun Belt
   And Most Other Moves
   PICTURES of retirees basking in Sun Belt retirement havens are everywhere in the winter months. 
So it's easy to assume that older Americans are migrating en masse to warmer climes. 
Wrong. 

   People aged 65 years and older actually show a marked tendency to stay put. 
Census Bureau figures show that fewer than 5% of this age group change their geographic location. 

   The result is that the Midwest, the Great Lakes region, and parts of the Northeast are actually getting "grayer" than most of the Sun Belt. 
Younger people are moving out of these states, seeking better opportunities, and older people are staying on. 
In 1986, 19 states had at least 12.5% of their population aged 65 or older. 
Only one, Florida, is a bona fide Sun Belt representative. 

   Florida is a stark exception to the graying of the Frost Belt. 
With a median age of 36, it has the oldest population of any state. 
In fact, for a glimpse of the U.S. population in roughly 30 years, look at Florida right now. 
Its share of elderly (18% of the population is 65 years plus) is roughly what the U.S. population will look like in the year 2020. 

   Six States Gain Bulk
   Of Legal Immigrants
   WHILE ILLEGAL aliens make the headlines, an unheralded but steady stream of lawful immigrants continues to pour into the U.S. 
In 1986, nearly 602,000 foreigners were granted legal immigrant status. 
That's the highest figure in more than 50 years and a total slightly less than the population of Washington, D.C. 

   Where did these people go? 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that nearly three-quarters of the new arrivals headed for six states: California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois. 

   As for where they came from, the just-released INS 1986 Statistical Yearbook has an intriguing breakdown. 
California took in 13,600 Vietnamese immigrants. 
Nearly 22,000 Cubans landed in Florida, as did 121 Romanians. 
Mississippi admitted 69 Filipinos and one Peruvian. 
And 68 Poles found a home in Idaho.

   About 9.7 million people were thrown in a jail
cell in the United States during the year that ended June 30, 1988,
the Justice Department said Sunday.
   During the same year, some 9.6 million people were released from
jail, and both numbers represented increases of 20 percent over
1983 figures, said the Office of Justice Statistics study.
   The average jail stay was three days, with 39 percent of inmates
spending one day or less behind bars, 23 percent spending two to
four days and 10 percent spending five to seven days, the study
said.
   About 3 percent served more than six months and 1 percent spent
more than a year behind bars.
   On June 30, 1988, the jail population totaled 343,569, or 144 of
every 100,000 Americans, the study said. That rate was 47 percent
higher than the 98 per 100,000 five years earlier.
   The study focused on local jails, defined as locally
administered confinement facilities holding people awaiting trial
or sentenced to terms usually of a year or less. About 51 percent
of the people in jail had not been convicted of any crime when they
were incarcerated, while 49 percent had been convicted, the same
level as in 1983, the study found.
   The census did not include facilities in Connecticut, Delaware,
Hawaii, Rhode Island and Vermont that combine jails with prisons,
which are state or federal institutions.
   The study did not indicate the main charges of the 9.7 million
brought into custody.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Jail populations in Southern states grew 61 percent between
1983 and 1988, to a total of 143,751 on June 30, 1988, while jail
populations in the West increased 58 percent to 91,559; the
Northeast jail population grew by 57 percent to 57,613 and the
Midwest grew by 28 percent to 50,646.
   _The states with the largest percentage increase between June
30, 1983, and the same day on 1988 were Nevada, up 149 percent;
Arizona, 104 percent; Florida and Texas, 93 percent; New Jersey 86
percent; Tennessee, 81 percent.
   _The only places where jail populations declined were Alaska,
down 27 percent, and Washington, D.C., which reclassified an
institution from a jail to a prison.
   _The highest rates of jail inmates per 100,000 state residents
were in Georgia, 276; Louisiana, 255; Florida, 229; California,
227; Tennessee, 222; and Nevada, 222.
   _The lowest rates per 100,000 state residents were in Iowa, 37;
North Dakota, 43; Maine, 56; Nebraska, 72; and New Hampshire and
South Dakota, both 73.
   _The female jail population rose 93 percent during the five-year
period to 30,411 on June 30, 1988. Women still represented only 9
percent of the total jail population, compared with 7 percent in
1983. The male population rose 51 percent to 313,158.
   _The percentage of juveniles in adult jails declined from 0.8
percent in 1983 to 0.5 percent in 1988, reflecting a 3 percent drop
for boys and a 4 percent drop for girls.
   _The racial breakdown of inmates was 43 percent non-Hispanic
whites, 41 percent non-Hispanic blacks, 15 percent Hispanics and 1
percent either American Indians, Alaska natives, Asians or Pacific
Islanders.
   _Of the 667 people who died in jail during the year ending June
30, 1988, a total of 284 (43 percent) were suicides, 274 (41
percent) were illnesses not including AIDS, 66 (10 percent) died of
AIDS, 10 (1 percent) were homicide victims and 33 (5 percent) died
of other causes including accidents.
   _Jail capacity increased 30 percent to 339,633 beds between 1983
to 1988, and the amount of rated capacity that was occupied totaled
101 percent in 1988, up from 85 percent five years earlier.
However, about 40,000 inmates, some 12 percent of the jail
population on June 30, 1988, were being held for other correctional
authorities, including some 26,500 held because of overcrowding
elsewhere.
