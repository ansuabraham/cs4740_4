   Fifth-grade teacher Susan Nardinger is
rallying the faithful in this river city to defend its short
reputation, which has been assaulted once again by river rats in
Lincoln City, Ore.
   Students in Nardinger's class touched off the battle two years
ago, when they petitioned the Guinness Book of World Records to
declare the 201-foot-long Roe River northeast of Great Falls the
world's shortest river.
   Guinness editors agreed, and the Roe displaced Lincoln City's D
River in the 1988 edition of the record book.
   But Lincoln City was not about to be sold short.
   They remeasured the D River and announced that it was 120 feet,
mysteriously smaller than the last measuring. And, Guinness editors
notified the Lincoln City Chamber of Commerce recently that the D
River would be back in the books by the 1991 edition _ unless a
shorter river is found.
   Well, that's just what students in Great Falls intend to do, and
they'll look no farther than the Roe.
   Nardinger said the Roe could claim a length of only 30 feet
because it has two forks, and the students submitted the longer of
the two for consideration of the record.
   ``I stand behind the kids 100 percent,'' she said Friday.
   She dismissed the D River as an ``ocean water backup,'' not a
river at all and suggested Guinness officials take a look for
themselves.
   Molly Peterson, one of the students who helped petition on
behalf the Roe, took a more philosophical approach. She said the
Roe is still the shortest river, but ``records are made to be
broken.''

   A 6-foot alligator out for an evening
stroll on a suburban sidewalk drew a neighborly reaction from Ruben
Hernandez. He tackled the meat-eating reptile, kept it safe for its
owner and refused to tattle.
   ``I grabbed the tail and put a foot on (the alligator's) back,''
he said. ``I started screaming to put the duct tape around the
alligator's mouth.''
   Hernandez, 32, said he took a few shots to the head wrestling
the 200-pound alligator when the beast whipped its powerful tail,
but he and his brother-in-law loaded the gator into their pickup
truck.
   When the sun came up Friday, Hernandez watched the huge reptile
lash at a chain holding it in the truck and questioned his bravado
of the previous night.
   ``I could have gotten hurt,'' he said.
   Hernandez said contacted the animal's owner and arranged to
return the beast. He refused to identify the owner, who officials
said lacked permits to keep the exotic animal.
   ``I can't imagine that anyone in possession of an alligator
legally would allow it to run loose in an area where it could come
in contact with people,'' said Eva Schultz, a warden for the
California Department of Fish and Game in Long Beach.
   She said it is illegal to keep an alligator without a special
permit, adding that those permits are rarely issued.

<HEAD>Oregon Town Refuses to Concede Shortest River Title to Montana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to the meddling of a group of
sharp-eyed Montana fifth graders, Oregon's ``D River'' has lost its
30-year title as the world's shortest river, but not without a
fight from miffed local officials.
   Editors of the Guinness Book of World Records agreed to give the
title to the Roe River in Great Falls, Mont., after students there
spent the past school year researching the river, which flows
through a state park.
   The students concluded the Roe is 201 feet, far shorter than the
440-foot D River near Lincoln City, and submitted their evidence to
the Guinness editors.
   ``On the basis of that, the Roe River was shorter,'' assistant
editor Cyd Smith said from the publisher's New York office.
   News of the change was not well-received in Lincoln City,
however, where the D River has held the title of shortest named
river for 30 years.
   ``Where a river begins and ends may be in the eye of the
beholder,'' Mayor Dell Isham said Wednesday.
   In fact, Lincoln City now insists the D is only 120 feet long,
give or take 5 feet. City officials are preparing documentation to
convince Guinness editors that they were right the first time and
that the D River should regain its rightful title in the book's
1990 edition. The deadline is past for next year's edition.
   Of course, the question being asked in Great Falls is: How can a
river shrink from 440 feet to 120 feet? At first it was funny, but
fewer people are laughing now that it's clear Lincoln City is
serious.
   ``It's fun to a point, but it has no end when people can come
back and keep shortening it until it's kind of ridiculous,'' said
Susie Nardinger, the Great Falls teacher who led her class in the
river study.
   The Roe River's acceptance into the records book is a matter of
pride to the community's 60,000 residents, she said.
   ``Our students went about it perfectly innocently,'' she said.
``The victory has been marred because Oregon came out with its
claims and, in a sense, stole the limelight at the peak of their
success.''
   Signs soon will grace the banks of the Roe to proclaim its
world-class status. About 625 miles away in Lincoln City, similar
signs remain along the D River and there are no plans to remove
them.
   Isham says the dispute is simply a matter of setting the record
straight. Lincoln City insists previous estimates of the river's
length inaccurately measured from a point in the river that
actually is part of Devil's Lake.
   That point looked like part of the river because a landfill had
closed in the banks of the lake, Isham said.
   A spokesman for Gov. Neil Goldschmidt says the states' governors
could get out their yardsticks and settle the issue once and for
all.
   ``If it's a good, honest fight, we'll be there,'' Gregg Kantor
said. ``But it'll always be the shortest river in our hearts.''

   Rural high school science students who
sent Mississippi bugs to the Soviet Union are anxiously awaiting a
return shipment of insects from the Moscow Zoo.
   Science teacher Doug Fleury said the work started after students
wanted to recognize Soviet scientific achievements and he began
corresponding with the Soviets for them. Samples of unicorn
beetles, about the size of hen eggs, and velvet ants, a type of
wingless wasp, were sent to Moscow in 1985.
   Now two kinds of giant walking sticks and a giant roach are en
route to this rural area of northeast Mississippi.
   Fleury is pleased.
   ``It's just not done _ a country school swapping bugs with a
major international zoo,'' he said recently.
   On May 2 and 3, Jumpertown High pupils, with former pupils at
Thrasher High School where the work began, will celebrate the
project.
   Brad Fugitt, 18, of Booneville, who graduated from Thrasher last
year, said he had been collecting insects for Fleury for five years
and some of his insects have been sent as far as Moscow.
   ``It kind of feels like an honor,'' he said.
   Fugitt is waiting for a response to a letter he wrote recently
to the Moscow Zoo to invite Russian scientists to participate in an
insect-collecting expedition in Mississippi in June or July.
   Fleury said he has two hopes for the bug exchanges: to send some
of the pupils to the Soviet Union with a shipment of live insects
and to bring someone from Moscow to northeast Mississippi.
   ``It's not unusual for zoo people to have a bigger view of the
world than just geographical boundaries,'' Fleury said. ``The
scientific discipline doesn't have geographical boundaries. It has
biological boundaries.''

   A 275-foot river will be listed in the
1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's
shortest river, thanks to the efforts of fifth-graders at Lincoln
Elementary School.
   Teacher Susie Nardinger and her students received a letter
recently from Guinness officials saying their documentation had
been accepted for the Roe River, northeast of Great Falls.
   The short stretch of water flows past a fish hatchery and is
named for fish eggs.
   The Roe will replace in Guinness the 440-foot-long D River at
Lincoln City, Ore.
   Students launched their efforts in October, and the class
learned how complicated a project can become during the ensuing six
months, Nardinger said.
   ``They learned that they had to work through channels,'' she
said.
   Before Guinness editors would even consider listing it, the Roe
had to be an official river in the eyes of U.S. government
officials.
   Much of the time was spent trying to gain an official blessing
for the river from the Domestic Names Committee of the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names. The committee approved the name of Roe River
on March 10.

   They've had to call out a team from
the U.S. Geological Survey to resolve the question of which river
is the world's shortest.
   A fifth-grade class at Lincoln elementary school in Great Falls,
Mont., recently had Montana's Roe River measured and declared the
world's shortest, replacing Lincoln City's D River in the Guinness
Book of World Records.
   The Roe River flows between 275 and 307 feet from a spring into
the Missouri River. The D River flows from Devil's Lake into the
Pacific Ocean.
   However, the record book's entry listing the D River as 440 feet
long was based on an outdated survey a century old; a variety of
state agencies in Oregon say the river could be as short as 100
feet long.
   The answer about which river wins the trophy for shortness is
expected soon.

   Mickey Mouse acted as host at a surprise
reunion in Disneyland of a former Soviet officer and a U.S. Army
officer who first met at the Elbe River during World War II.
   The Soviet visitor, Vladimir Kabaidze, 64, mentioned to his
American hosts that he had exchanged addresses in 1945 at Torgau,
Germany, with an American when they were both first lieutenants.
   Kabaidze, in the United States after being honored by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a model of Soviet labor, said he had
written his address on a Russian ruble and had gotten in return the
address of GI Frank Parent written on a German mark.
   The reunion Saturday of the two men was arranged by Kabaidze's
host, Barney Oldfield, according to Disneyland spokeswoman Barbara
Warren.
   Oldfield, a retired U.S. Army colonel now working for Litton
Industries, located Parent, 78, in Texas and flew him to California
for the Disneyland surprise.
   ``Mickey Mouse acted as intermediary,'' Ms. Warren said. ``After
greeting Mr. Kabaidze, he waltzed the Russian gentleman over to
where Mr. Parent was standing.
   ``He was pleasantly shocked when Mr. Parent handed him the ruble
note,'' she said.
   The date written on the ruble was April 30, 1945, Ms. Warren
said, exactly 43 years to the day of the reunion.

   The Third Annual Polar Bear Classic,
sponsored by the Great Lakes Surfing Association, ran into some
poor weather. It was too nice.
   The 35 participants in Saturday's event enjoyed clear blue skies
and unseasonably warm temperatures in the upper 60s. For Great
Lakes surfers, who rely on insulated suits, gloves and hoods, balmy
weather makes for poor surfing.
   Waves reached a respectable 4 to 6 feet Friday night, but
Saturday's nice weather generated so-called ankle snappers of just
1 to 2 feet.
   Jeff VanHoeven of Kalamazoo, 27, won the men's competition using
a push-off method. With one foot on his board and one on the lake
bottom, he timed a wave and kick-started.
   Dave Irwin of Bloomfield Hills used a similar technique to win
the long board competition.
   ``Michigan is surrounded by fresh water seas,'' said Irwin, the
association founder and a former Californian. ``You've just got to
search a little to find waves good enough to surf.''
   Other surfers, their competitive spark doused by the lackluster
waves, simply laid on their boards and engaged in friendly paddle
races.
   Higher waves come during storms, and the association's telephone
network goes into action when Great Lakes marine forecasts call for
rough weather.

   It might be just another Loch Ness
``Nessie'' or Lake Tahoe ``Tessie'' _ water beasts that catch the
imagination but somehow are never trapped themselves.
   But at least a couple of people near Wadsworth have reported
seeing an alligator in the Truckee River, and state game wardens
are taking the claim seriously enough to set baited traps for the
reptile.
   So far, however, the 'gator, described as 3-4 feet long and 3 or
4 years old, has given authorities the slip.
   Jim Curran, the state's regional fisheries supervisor, said the
reported alligator is too small to pose a threat and might not
survive the near-freezing winter waters anyway. The reptiles
normally live in tropical rivers and marshes.
   ``We figure this one must have been someone's pet,'' Curran
said. ``When it got too big, they dumped it in the river.''
   The first reported sighting came Oct. 14 when Jack Maughan said
he spotted the snub-nosed reptile in the river while taking his
daily walk along the bank. And Maughan's son, Bryan, says he saw
the animal Sunday.
   The story of the Wadsworth 'gator sightings isn't being ignored
by the town, located about 10 miles east of the Reno-Sparks area.
   Tom Peterson, the local fire chief and owner of the Wadsworth
Inn, has made T-shirts boasting the town is the state's 'gator
capital. And this weekend the fire department volunteers are
hosting an Indian taco feed featuring ``super-hot 'gator sauce.''
   Meanwhile, the story continues to grow.
   ``Yeah, it's 3 to 4 long, but at 11 o'clock, after a few beers,
that 'gator gets to be a 16-footer,'' claims Peterson.

   Veteran liars here saw a familiar fib
when they read a story this week about a liars club in Nebraska.
   A lie judged good enough to get the alleged author inducted into
a liars hall of fame in Nebraska in 1987 bears a striking
resemblance to a lie that won a Missouri man the title of World
Champion Liar in the Burlington Liar's Club 1979 contest.
   Robert Peterson Sr., of Dannebrog, Neb., claims one day in
February it was so cold that he saw a lawyer with his hands in his
own pockets.
   That tale got Peterson inducted into the National Liars Hall of
Fame in Dannebrog.
   But in 1979, C.A. Laurie of Eckland, Mo., was named World
Champion Liar by the Burlington Liar's Club for saying it was so
cold in Missouri one winter that he saw a politician standing on
the street corner with his hands in his own pockets.
   ``The lie we named a champion years ago was told with a
politician _ not a lawyer,'' said Don Reed, vice president and
20-year member of the Burlington Liar's Club.
   But Reed said he doesn't mind.
   ``I feel there should be nothing to stop anybody from telling a
tall tale,'' he said. ``We're dedicated to the perpetuation of the
American heritage of telling tall tales.''
   ``But we'll always be the granddaddy of them all,'' he added.
   The Burlington Liar's Club was founded in 1929 and chooses its
winner each New Year's Eve. Entries come from all over the country
and world. Last year, more than 200 lies were sent to the
Burlington club.
   At least, that's what they say.

<DATELINE>COLCA CANYON, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From a condor's perch on this gorge in
southern Peru you could look down on 10 of New York's World Trade
Center towers stacked end on end.
   The 60-mile-long Colca Canyon formed by the Colca River is the
deepest land gorge on Earth, according to the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   This mysterious land of desert-dry moonscapes, exotic
vegetation, active volcanoes and scattered pre-Columbian ruins is
just now emerging from obscurity.
   The canyon and surrounding Colca Valley are home to thousands of
Indians, descendants of pre-Inca tribesmen who settled here 3,000
years ago.
   ``The whole history of Peruvian man is summarized in this
startling landscape, which until only a few years ago was
incommunicado with the rest of Peru,'' wrote the Peruvian novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa in the foreword to the recently published
``Discovering The Colca Valley,'' one of the few books on the
region.
   Terraced fields painstakingly carved from the slopes still yield
corn and potatoes, the Indians' traditional staples. Ancient
irrigation canals keep the land productive.
   Some farms and hamlets rest precariously on canyon ledges,
giving the appearance of defying gravity or tempting fate.
   Most Indians still build their homes from adobe or rocks and
rely on the wool of their alpaca herds for clothing.
   They share these cloud-swept highlands with Andean condors and
scores of rare flora and fauna, such as giant cactuses and the
guanaco, an elusive cousin of the llama.
   From surrounding mountain ridges, the Colca plummets 14,339 feet
to the Colca River, according to Guinness. The World Trade Center
in New York is 1,350 feet high.
   The opposing lower wall descends 10,607 feet, nearly double the
depth of Arizona's Grand Canyon.
   Spanish conquistadors reached the Colca in the mid-1500s. They
built churches and towns atop Indian villages, and then left, said
Mauricio de Romana, one of the authors of ``Discovering The Colca
Valley.''
   Americans Robert Shippee and George Johnson led an expedition
into Colca and published an article in the January, 1934, issue of
National Geographic, calling it ``a lost valley of the Incas.''
   It was a brief interlude in the obscurity of the Colca, whose
wonders stayed forgotten until a gravel road was forged in the
mid-1970s, linking it with Arequipa, 115 miles south.
   Arequipa, Peru's second largest city, is 545 miles southeast of
Lima.
   ``To the surprise of Peruvians and foreigners alike, this
important setting, full of history and culture, appeared to the
world,'' Romana said in an interview.
   The road brought change to the Indians' traditional
self-sufficient lifestyle, tourists and spreading fame.
   The Guinness book recorded the Colca's depth for the first time
in the mid-1980s, Romana said.
   The road now carries travelers on a rugged five-hour journey in
the shadow of the Andes' majestic spine, across the barren and cold
altiplano and skirting volcanic cones.
   The canyon rim offers a bird's eye view of walls plunging
thousands of feet to the rushing Colca River and of condors gliding
on thermal winds over farms and villages.
   The most dramatic places are several days farther by foot and
mule and are seen by just a hearty handful of the 10,000 to 15,000
tourists who reach the Colca yearly, according to Romana.
   Anthony Holley, an Arequipa guide, said some visitors are
discouraged because they cannot easily reach the deepest zone.
   The arduous journey by road, a shortage of lodgings and
generally unsafe conditions signal some of the major problems
facing Peruvian tourism.
   In the last several years Peru has been hit by spreading social
and economic chaos, fueled by its worst recession of the century.
   Tourism officials say the country does not have the money to
invest substantially in tourism infrastructure or even protect what
already exists.
   But officials say the Colca so far seems to have been spared
from a recent upsurge in highway banditry and the bloody guerrilla
insurgency plaguing many other areas of the country.
   Romana, a director of the Colca Foundation, which seeks to
preserve the zone, said the arrival of the modern world has not yet
had a serious impact on the Colca or its people.

   Two Connecticut College sophomores set
a world record for Frisbee-tossing but finally succumbed to the
need for sleep and ended their marathon session after more than
four days.
   Jeremy Tubb and John Fischer beat the previous record of 110
hours, 40 minutes at 7:40 a.m. Tuesday, and ended their streak at
3:36 p.m. after 118 hours and 36 minutes, said Daniel MacAlpine, a
college spokesman.
   The two had planned to toss the disk until 5 p.m. Tuesday, but
were beginning to hallucinate because of lack of sleep, MacAlpine
said.
   Tubb of Oklahoma City and Fischer of Maplewood, N.J., played
catch on a green between two dormitory buildings during daytime
hours and moved inside a student center building between 9 p.m. and
6 a.m.
   They were entitled to a five-minute break every hour, but
accumulated their time to take a nap at 6 a.m. each morning.
   The old record was set by Jamie Knerr and Keith Ziery between
Aug. 23-27, 1981 in Allentown, Pa., according to the Guinness Book
of World Records.
   To beat the record they had to make a 45-foot toss at least
13,282 times within the time period. The rules permitted record
challengers to drop the flying disk, but no one could help them
retrieve it.
   Cyd Smith, assistant editor of the Guinness Book in New York
City, said new records must be logged by witnesses and exceed
previous marks by a half-hour or an hour.

   The exotic Orient Express, which normally runs
between Paris and Istanbul, will be taking a 12,400-mile, 23-day
sentimental journey from Paris to Hong Kong next fall, the longest
train ride in history.
   A Japanese television network announced Tuesday that it will
charter the venerable train for a jaunt into the record books, with
stops in Cologne, East Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk
and Beijing.
   The cost for each of the 90 passengers: about $15,000.
   Travelers completing the journey will receive a certificate from
the Guinness Book of World Records affirming their participation in
the world's longest train trip, according to spokesmen for the Fuji
Television Network.
   Guinness lists the nine-day journey from Lisbon to Khabarovsk in
the Soviet Union as the longest rail journey on record.
   Orient Express '88 is being sponsored by Fuji in honor of the
network's 30th anniversary. Publicists for Fuji said the 16-car
train will depart Paris on Sept. 2 and is scheduled to arrive in
Hong Kong on Sept. 25.
   That will mark the end of the line for the 45 couples aboard _
15 each from America, Europe and Asia _ but the train will keep
going by ship to Japan, where it will be used for a series of
excursions for two more months.
   Among the difficulties involved in the journey are the different
gauges of track in Europe, the Soviet Union and Japan.
   Before entering the Soviet Union, the undercarriage of the train
will have to be replaced to accommodate the wider-gauge Soviet
track. The undercarriage will have to be replaced again at the
Sino-Soviet border, since Chinese gauge is the same as European,
and once again in Japan, to accommodate the narrower-gauge track
there, the sponsors said.
   Passengers will be treated to opera and ballet performances,
river cruises and a hovercraft tour of Lake Baikal in the Soviet
Union.
   The cuisine will vary along with the landscape. The chefs will
be French from Paris to Moscow, Russian from Moscow to Zabaikalsk
and Chinese from there to Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 years after Stephen Brodie
supposedly took his famous dive off the Brooklyn Bridge and lived
to brag about it, a paraplegic dangled off the span in a wheelchair
for a shot at the record books.
   Ramond Masa, 40, carrying fireworks and samurai swords, lowered
himself on a rope Monday morning from the middle of the bridge and
dangled 75 feet above the East River for more than an hour.
   Police finally persuaded him to lower himself further so he
could be guided on to a police launch.
   The Cuban refugee, who came to the United States in 1969, called
himself ``America's No. 1 Stuntman,'' although it was his first
stunt. Masa claimed he had dangled from the 105-year-old landmark
for seven hours.
   ``I planned for three months to do something real crazy to get
into the Guinness record book,'' he said. Originally, he had
planned to don a Ninja costume, light six M-80 firecrackers and
hold two, 3-foot-long samurai swords and plunge off the bridge.
   But he changed his plans after the two nylon bags of equipment
made the 75-foot leap without him.
   Masa, who lost use of both legs after a shooting in 1977, said
his making the Guinness Book of World Records would inspire other
paraplegics. ``They think that because they're in wheelchairs their
life is ended,'' he said.
   Masa was booked on charges of disorderly conduct, illegal
possession of a knife and dealing with fireworks, said police
spokesman Sgt. John Clifford.
   Masa, who also uses the name El-Shah Muhammed El-Ratuli and has
a minor criminal record dating to 1977, was given a summons to
appear in court Sept. 19.
   He initially told reporters his name was ``Megaman.'' He handed
out red, white and blue business cards that proclaimed, ``Living on
the edge is my business _ American No. 1 Stuntmen.''
   He said he was dropped off in the center of the span about
midnight by his brother, whom he refused to identify by name.
   Dragging his wheelchair and bags containing the swords and
firecrackers behind him, Masa crawled to the edge of the span,
where he tied a nylon cord used by mountain climbers around his
waist, through the wheelchair and secured it to a 5-inch thick
piece of bridgework. He then pushed the wheelchair off the bridge
and shimmied down the rope after it.
   Masa said he was not afraid while dangling. He was noticed after
dawn by a tugboat.
   According to the legend, in July 1886, Brodie, a 23-year-old
shoeshine man, took the leap from the bridge.
   Reporters were on hand to see what appeared to be a man dive 135
feet and emerge unscathed from the river. However, skeptics believe
that Brodie, with the help of cohorts, threw a weighted dummy into
the river.
   Masa expressed no remorse over the rush-hour traffic jam his
stunt caused. ``This is New York. They (the commuters) like the
excitement on Monday morning.''

  [Text] The historic Farakka Day is being observed today. 
Eighteen years ago on May 16, 1976 the late leader of the 
suffering people, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, brought out 
a huge procession comprising several hundred thousand people to 
demand an equitable share of the Ganges River water. People 
from all walks of life in Bangladesh from Teknaf [southernmost 
tip of the country] to Tetulia [northernmost tip of the country] 
joined this long march, which was led by Maulana Bhasani. This 
long march started at 1000 from Dhaka on May 16. The 
processionists travelled (?456) miles and made an overnight halt 
at Chapainawabganj [District]. On the morning of May 17 when 
this procession marched toward the border at that time the whole 
path was converted into a huge sea of agitated people. The 
procession stopped at a spot [name indistinct] about three miles 
inside the border at 1600. On that day, the people of South Asia 
and the whole world witnessed through this massive procession 
the demand raised by the people of Bangladesh for a fair share 
of the waters of the Ganges River. The world was amazed to see 
this huge procession by the people of this country to realize 
their legitimate share of the water of an international river. 
The world had extended its support to this cause of the people 
of Bangladesh long before this procession took place. 
  The adverse effect created in Bangladesh due to the 
construction of the Farakka Barrage on the Ganges River is now 
discernible. The situation has further deteriorated. Vast 
tracts of land in Bangladesh are becoming deserts due to this 
withdrawal of the Ganges water at Farakka. The part of the 
Ganges River that flows into Bangladesh is known as the Padma. 
This Padma was once a mighty river, and the people living along 
its banks led a very affluent and prosperous life. The part of 
Bangladesh through which this river flows was once lush, green, 
and full of crops. At present, these coastal areas have been 
turned into deserts. The vast bed of the Padma River has now 
turned into a desert and has become sandy. Many parts of the 
Padma River have also become grazing ground for cattle. The 
river has become totally unnavigable in several areas. The level 
of underground water in the areas adjoining the Padma River has 
fallen tremendously due to the shortage of water in the river. 
This has led to the destruction of agricultural lands and 
trees. Scarcity of water in the river has also severely 
affected navigation and shipping transport. This has directly 
affected the life of about 30 million people living on the banks 
of the Padma River and has posed a threat to their livelihood. 
  This situation has created a negative impact on the economy 
of a least developed country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants 
to be relieved from this unbearable situation and demands its 
legitimate share of the water of the Ganges, which is an 
international river. Bangladesh is making efforts at the 
bilateral level for a peaceful settlement of the water sharing 
issue. In this regard, several meetings were held in India and 
Bangladesh at different levels. It is unfortunate that no remedy 
has been found yet for this problem. [Words indistinct] This 
Ganges River problem is a life and death problem for about 30 
million people in Bangladesh. 
  Since the present democratic government came to power, it 
has 
been holding direct talks with the Indian Government at 
different levels with a view to resolving this Ganges water 
sharing problem. So far the talks have not yielded any positive 
results. On the other hand, the talks have become long and 
drawn out. During her visit to India, Prime Minister Khaleda 
Zia held talks with the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, on 
the issue of resolving this Ganges water problem. India gave 
its assurance that it would take active measures to resolve this 
problem. After this, several rounds of talks were held between 
the officials of the two countries for working out a solution to 
the problem, but no progress has been made. Bangladesh has 
raised this issue regarding the sharing of the Ganges River 
water at the Commonwealth summit, the Nonaligned Movement, and 
in various international forums. It has also held talks with 
different countries of the world seeking their active 
cooperation in securing an equitable share of the Ganges River 
water. The world has extended its support to the demand raised 
by Bangladesh for an equitable share of the Ganges River water. 
Diplomatic efforts have also been made for a peaceful solution 
of the Ganges River water problem but no progress has been made 
in this regard. 
  Today is 16 May. It commemorates the historic Farakka Day. 
On this day, the people of Bangladesh demand an early solution 
to the water sharing problem -- which is their life and death 
question. This demand was also raised at the discussion 
meetings, seminars, symposia, and rallies held today in 
observance of the day. The Ganges water sharing issue is solely 
a humanitarian problem. It is not a political problem. It 
would be inhuman to consider this problem as a political issue. 
We hope that in the interest of good neighborly relations, 
India will take effective measures for an early solution to this 
problem.

   There's not much you can buy for a
penny these days. But with 1,000,131 of them, you can make your way
into the Guinness Book of World Records.
   This weekend, a local group trying to raise money for a $40,000
playground will try to lay down at least that many coins in a high
school gymnasium to set a world record in length for a line of
pennies.
   Volunteers plan to begin creating 58 lanes 3 feet wide and 44
feet long on the gym floor Friday night. When they are finished
sometime Saturday, they hope to have 1,540,500 pennies set down in
rows an inch apart, creating a line 13.66 miles long.
   The Guinness-recognized record is 1,000,130 one-cent coins put
down in a 12.29-mile line Nov. 15, 1985, by students at Blacktown
Girls' High School in New South Wales, Australia.
   ``We figured out that, in order to accomplish the whole thing in
a 12-hour period, we would have to lay down something like 30
pennies a second,'' volunteer coordinator Carolyn Smith said.
   Coordinators have lined up 30 people for each two-hour shift of
penny-laying. The group also has planned ahead how to get the
pennies picked up after the record attempt.
   ``We'll start vacuuming them up on Sunday morning,'' said
volunteer Martha Wolf.
   The group received donations for the effort from children,
businesses and service groups. One problem, however, was that the
three banks in Fort Madison only keep about $300 each in pennies at
one time.
   The banks arranged for 800,000 pennies to be shipped in by
armored car from Davenport, and paid $1,000 to have the pennies
wrapped and shipped, which took about three weeks.

   State officials aren't quite ready to
file for a patent, but they're definitely taking a ``pro-pie-tary''
interest in Key lime pie.
   Under a bill approved in committee Wednesday, the creamy
concoction would be designated the official state pie. Key lime
pie, legislators explain, is ``properly'' made only with limes from
the Florida Keys.
   State symbols are serious business in identity-conscious
Florida, which already has a state tree, beverage, shell, stone,
gem, animal, freshwater and saltwater fish, marine and saltwater
mammal, air fair, festival and litter control symbol.
   In 1987, lawmakers designated the American alligator as the
official state reptile.
   According to a committee staff analysis, ``by being officially
designated, the Key lime pie would be in greater demand, thereby
promoting this fruit unique to Florida.''
   The Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the House
Community Affairs Committee voted 5-0 for the bill, which must be
now be approved by the full House.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: River crossing in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The USDollars 500m (Pounds 267m) Jamuna Bridge project in Bangladesh has
been given the go-ahead by the World Bank after a further internal review of
the economic return of the project.
Tender documents are expected to relate to a bridge designed for road, but
with the potential to be adapted to road plus rail at a future date and at
minimum extra cost.
This evaluation was in broad agreement with the conclusion reached earlier
by the bank's consulting engineers, RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON together with
Dutch consultants NEDECO and BANGLADESH CONSULTANTS.
The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the Jamuna river in
Bangladesh. The river forms a 15km barrier, separating the western side,
with its fertile north-west zone, from the eastern side containing the
commercial centre, Dhaka and the country's primary port, Chittagong.
The only fixed crossing of the river to date in Bangladesh is the power line
interconnector supported on caissons 110 metres deep, believed to be the
deepest in existence and for which RPT were the engineers. The crossing will
comprise a bridge structure about 5km long, major river training works and
road embankments on the flood plain between the river training works and the
high banks.
Mobility of the river banks is such that the final location of the 2,700
metre long guide bunds, and hence the length of the bridge can only be
determined at the time of construction. Cost estimates, design and the
proposed contract documents have been set down to accommodate this somewhat
unusual situation.
The bridge is 4,800 metres long, bounded by the guide bunds of the river
training works. The substructure will be 80 metres long, 2.5 metres in
diameter raking steel piles in bents of two or four. These will support a
composite steel box girder and concrete slab superstructure in spans of 100
metres.
An alternative design including a segmental pre-stressed concrete box girder
of similar span will be included in the tender documents.

   They met on the bus and became friends on
the bus. So when it came to getting married Saturday, it seemed
only natural that Claude Methot and Jan Cole should board the Metro
to take their vows.
   The couple left a wake of smiles and horn-honking motorists as
their wedding bus cruised to a luncheon after the onboard ceremony.
The bus was decked out with crepe paper, paper bells and strings of
tin cans tied to the bumper. And, of course, a ``Just Married''
sign.
   ``Both of us are bus people,'' said Methot, 40, a paper company
employee who lives in Portland. Methot said he and his bride became
close friends a few months after they met while riding the bus to
work together.
   ``There are some very nice people on the bus, but I never
thought I'd meet anyone, and never thought I'd get married, on a
bus,'' said the 41-year-old bride, who works as a salesperson.
``It's one of the craziest things I've done in my life.''
   Metro General Manager Sarah deDoes said she was for the ceremony
from the start. ``Being a romantic myself, when they asked me, I
thought it was just great,'' she said.
   Asked about the couple's honeymoon plans, Methot said, ``It
won't be Greyhound, that's for sure. We're going to Bermuda in the
fall _ they have a good bus system there.''

   Hundreds of people turned out to labor
with shovels and bare hands for their moment of fame _ as builders
of the world's longest sand sculpture.
   After crews worked much of the day under a hot June sun, a
surveying company certified Friday that the sand castle measured
15,063 feet, giving the crew a good shot at getting into the next
Guinness Book of World Records.
   The centerpiece of the project, a 15-foot-high castle with the
logos of corporate sponsors, had been built earlier in the week by
two leading sand sculptors, Todd Vander-Pluym and Mark Altamar.
Then, volunteers made two long, long wings on the building Friday,
following guide lines painted on the beach and taking care to
sculpt the sand and not just pile it up.
   Festival chairman Mary Snipes-Phillips said the surveyors'
findings, along with videotape, photographs, and volunteers'
signatures, will be sent to the Guinness Book of World Records.
   The castle would appear to easily beat the 10,760-foot-long sand
millipede built along South Padre Beach, Texas, in March 1987,
which is listed in the 1989 Guinness book.
   Estimates of the number of folks manning the shovel brigades or
otherwise helping on the project ranged up to 2,000.
   ``It's tough, but I think we'll make it,'' said one volunteer,
Richard Lamb.
   The castle was called ``The Neverending Fantasy'' and included
sculptings of a jet plane, a ``Jungle Lagoon Golf Course,'' a shark
and a castle turret topped with a tiny cocktail umbrella.
   The project was part of the city's six-day Sun Fun Festival
which opened on Friday. By Saturday, much of the castle remained,
but the tide had already begun to wash away parts of it.

   Stefan Szwarnowski, the oldest person to
sail solo across the Atlantic Ocean, is heading out to sea again.
   The 76-year-old Polish native left this New Jersey seashore
community Friday to return home the same way he came, bound for
England aboard the 24-foot Tawny Pipit. He has no radio transmitter
and plans to navigate by sun and stars.
   At least one American friend has tried to talk him out of it and
offered to buy him a plane ticket home.
   ``It (would be) a difficult trip for a 21-year-old man,'' said
Jack Hamann, a marina owner.
   In August, Szwarnowski showed up near Townsends Inlet after a
12-week voyage. His feat will land him in this year's Guinness Book
of World Records as the oldest person to sail alone across the
Atlantic, according to a spokesman for the book.
   During that trip, light winds doubled the time he thought it
would take to make the crossing. His water supply ran low, and he
lost weight.
   Since his arrival, though, he has regained some weight, traveled
by train across the United States and made many friends, despite
his broken English.
   Szwarnowski said he expects to arrive in England in about six
weeks.
   And what if he doesn't arrive at all?
   ``If something happens, you're going,'' he said philosophically.
``If not, you're still going.''

<HEAD>15 Million Hindus Wash Away Sins At Giant Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALLAHABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 15 million Hindus _ holy men
from their Himalayan cave homes, naked recluses from forest dens and
ordinary pilgrims from across India _ began immersing themselves at
the confluence of two sacred rivers today.
   Today's bathing is the high point of the seven-week Kumbh Mela
festival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records is
the largest religious gathering on Earth.
   The ceremonial bathing began at 4 a.m. with the blowing of conch
shells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful, who believe a dip
in the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free them
from the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation.
   Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, creator of the world in the
Hindu religion and a member of the supreme trinity in the pantheon
of Hindu gods, awakens at 4 a.m. and therefore the day should start
at that hour.
   The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 12 years, according to the
lunar calendar, at the time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiter
in Taurus, the sun and moon in Capricorn, and a series of
complicated calculations of Hindu astrology.
   But today takes on added significance, for it is also the day of
the new moon, another good omen.
   Two people died in the early hours of the mass bathing. A
50-year-old man collapsed on the river bank after his bath and soon
died, and a woman drowned when her boat capsized, according to a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1954, about
800 pilgrims died in a stampede at the holy festival.
   ``Either these people are crazy or there must be something we
can't see or understand,'' said Nina Marshall, a 23-year-old student
from Berkeley, Calif. who was among dozens of Americans that came to
see the religious spectacle.
   ``It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims
trekking to the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers.
   For the faithful, the bathing is often a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.
   ``I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,''
said Sarju Mahato, a farmer from Bihar state, as he tended the
blisters on his two sons' feet. ``We saved money and came here.''
   The festival takes the name Kumbh Mela from a story in Hindu
mythology in which a god seized a pot of nectar that made gods
invincible in their war against the demons. ``Kumbh'' means pot, and
``mela'' means fair.
   A drop of nectar from the pot is thought to have fallen at
Allahabad where the Ganges and Jamuna rivers come together. A bath
at the exact spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring
salvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   The bathing at the Kumbh Mela began with processions of holy men,
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance
of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna
and the mythical Swaraswati.
   The Swaraswati cannot be seen, but Hindus believe it flows
beneath the Earth's surface where the two other rivers meet.
   There was color everywhere _ a profusion of saffron, scarlet,
white and gold robes.
   Some holy men wore only loincloths. Some had their foreheads
smeared with vermilion and sandalwood paste, and some wore garlands
of basil wreaths around their necks, wrists and arms.
   Some had shaven heads, others matted hair tied in knots atop
their heads.
   The ``nagas,'' or naked recluses, smeared their bodies with
ashes. They wore garlands of marigolds around their necks and blew
conch shells to drive away evil spirits.
   They danced holding spears, lances, staffs and small rocks
representing some of the Hindu faith's 32 million gods and goddesses.
   There were camels draped in brightly embroidered cloths, adorned
with feathers, beads and mirrors, with bells on their feet that
tinkled when they walked.
   Some pilgrims pulled chariots holding the holiest of the holy
men, who offered blessings to the others.
   The bathing followed the initiation of new nagas. Young men are
inducted into the naked order only once every 12 years during the
Kumbh Mela.
   On Sunday, 1,500 nagas-to-be shaved their heads, burned their
clothing and performed their last rites.
   ``From this moment they have renounced the material world and
since they will not depend on anyone anymore, they themselves
perform their last rites as if they are already dead from this
world,'' explained M.P. Ashnata, the fair's chief spokesman.

   The world's largest prefabricated power plant
began a slow journey Tuesday under tow up the Mississippi River, the
same body of water that it eventually will use to generate
electricity.
   Cables groaned when two tugboats in front pulled and two tugs in
back pushed the massive power plant, the Merrimac, off a dry dock at
a suburban New Orleans shipyard to begin its 208-mile journey
upriver.
   ``I feel real good. I've been working on this thing for 13 years.
We started literally from scratch,'' said Sidney Murray of
Catalyst-Old River Hydroelectric Ltd., one of the investors. ``It's
been exciting for everybody.''
   Murray videotaped the 12-story beige structure as it edged away
from its dock. About 75 spectators cheered from the dock.
   The power plant is 12 stories high, 456 feet long and weighs
about 25,000 tons. Company officials said that although the Merrimac
is smaller than some of the world's largest ships, it is believed to
be the largest structure to ever travel up the Mississippi River.
   The Merrimac is headed for a point 40 miles south of Vidalia,
where it will be fitted for operation in a channel where water will
run from the Mississippi River through the power plant turbines and
into the Atchafalaya River.
   Louisiana's first hydroelectric plant should be fully operational
by July 1, 1990, said Bill Fox of Ebasco, an engineering firm that
worked on the $500 million project.
   The Merrimac will creep upriver at 2 to 4 mph and should arrive
in northeast Louisiana over the weekend, he said.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' Fox said. ``It's been thought out
extremely well. Saving anything less than a hurricane, we ought to
be able to bring it in without any trouble.''
   The major obstacle is already anticipated _ the U.S. Highway 190
bridge at Baton Rouge. The bridge is too low for the tall structure,
so the plant must be partially submerged while it passes underneath.
   The Merrimac will probably be sunk 40 to 50 feet to leave a
clearance of at least five feet between the top of the plant and the
bottom of the bridge.
   The 10- to 20-hour process will be done by pumping water into
large hollow compartments that enable the structure to float. After
the plant clears the bridge, the water will be pumped out and the
Merrimac will resume its journey.
   Once in place near the Old River Control Structure, the Merrimac
will divert water from the Mississippi River through eight giant
turbines. The water will then flow through a two-mile-long channel
into the Atchafalaya River, a 17-foot drop.
   The plant is designed to generate 192 megawatts of electricity,
enough to light a city of 200,000 people.
   Owners of the power plant are the Merrimac Corp. of New York and
Dominion Capital Inc. of Virginia. The town of Vidalia shared
licensing for the project.

   A giant, 18-foot-long alligator is living
in Lake Okeechobee, boaters and fishermen claim, but a state
wildlife expert says he doubts it.
   ``It looks monstrous, bigger than our boat, and we have a
19-footer,'' Rebecca Dunn, who has been fishing on the lake with her
fishing-guide husband since 1966, said recently.
   ``We see it all the time,'' said Mrs. Dunn, who said she believes
the alligator is a female. ``She throws her food up in the air, way
up, then catches and eats it, mostly fish and birds.''
   Mrs. Dunn has named the alligator Hendrietta, for Hendry County,
one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee, which is about 100
miles northwest of Miami and at 700 square miles is Florida's
largest lake.
   Bass fisherman Sonny Pease said he saw the creature sunning
itself on shore with its tail curled around itself like Lady
Godiva's hair.
   Pease said that when he took his boat closer to the gator, he
kept repeating, ``Oh, my God, that alligator is long. Nobody's going
to believe this.''
   When he got within about 200 yards of the big reptile, it started
swimming toward his 18-foot boat.
   It ``was all of my boat's size,'' Pease recalled.
   An 18-foot alligator would break Florida's longest alligator
record by nearly 4 feet.
   However, wildlife biologist Mike Jennings of the state Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission in Gainesville said an 18-foot-long
alligator would be highly improbable.
   The longest gator caught since records were first kept in 1977
measured just over 14 feet and weighed 714 pounds, and was trapped
last month in the Apalachicola River southwest of Tallahassee.
Trappers estimated it was 100 years old.
   The heaviest gator, caught in April near Gainesville, weighed
1,043 pounds and was 13 feet long. It took a tow truck to lift it
and three scales to weigh it.
   ``That was a very healthy gator,'' Jennings said. ``I would've
questioned it, if I hadn't seen it myself.''
   The giant gator's real length may be determined after Sept. 1,
when Florida's monthlong alligator season starts.
   ``Every hunter who has a permit will be going for him,'' said
Pease's 22-year-old son, Keith.

   The strawberry shortcake was anything but
short Saturday as cooking school students put together a 216-foot
version of the summertime goodie.
   ``Rush! Speed! Speed!'' shouted Tammy Wood, a second-year
student at the New England Culinary Institute, as teams began
building what they hope will be officially recognized as the
world's largest strawberry shortcake.
   First down on the tables were the 31 sheet pans of shortcake cut
into 4-inch-wide strips. Next went about 7,200 strawberries, and
finally, 18 gallons of whipped cream.
   ``Step back, I need a picture of this,'' roared Richard Wobby,
the event's organizer, before the whipped cream went on. He also
brought the world its longest dish of maple sugar on snow in Barre
two years ago, a quarter-mile-long affair.
   As the students put the finishing touches on their cake, the
rain picked up, and the crowd lining the sidewalks rushed to the
center of State Street for one, or maybe more, of the 2,400 pieces.
   The largest strawberry shortcake, according to Wobby's research,
was 6 feet in diameter. By square footage, Saturday's
long-and-narrow version was considerably larger, Wobby said.
   There is currently no separate entry in the Guinness Book of
World Records for largest strawberry shortcake, but the students
are hoping to get recognition.
   ``It's a good gag,'' Wobby said. ``It's something we'll think
start thinking about and say, `That's impossible.' Then, all of a
sudden, the blood just turns on, and we find we have the motivation
to do it, and we do it.''

   A pet monkey named Bubba who escaped from a
basement window and eluded police for three hours finally made a
monkey out of everyone when he went home on his own, police said.
   The 2-foot-long spider monkey apparently escaped Thursday
afternoon by tearing through a screen window, said Albert
Droscoski, a Suffolk County police spokesman.
   The mischievous primate proceeded to shred the screens on
neighbors' windows, and chased some of the neighborhood children,
Droscoski said.
   When police arrived, Bubba mocked their efforts to capture him
by jumping on top of the police car. A police emergency services
unit tried to lasso him, but managed only to tree him in his own
back yard.
   After about three hours, Droscoski said, ``he made a monkey out
of everybody else. He decided to get back into the house through
the same basement window.''
   The monkey's owner was not at home at the time.

   A thousand smiling folks said good
morning to the nation and posed for a ``family portrait'' on Main
Street as a gesture of community spirit aimed at getting a new
prison to boost the town's economy.
   ``It shows they had pride in Canon City,'' said Don Packard,
mayor of the town of some 12,000 people. ``It was hot but I didn't
hear a complaint about the heat.''
   Packard and the portrait's organizers said they were pleased
with the turnout for the event, which was aimed at creating a sense
of community pride.
   The crowd waved and shouted ``Good Morning, America!'' for
photographers, and the high school band played.To wind things up, a
banner was unfurled carrying a message to the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, asking officials to consider Fremont County as a prison
site.
   ``Communities are out of the habit of doing things like this,''
Packard said. ``We are trying to build up the habit of going down
and participating in community events.''
   Organizers' next scheme to drum up enthusiasm about downtown
Canon City? An ``ugly pickup truck contest.''

Tired of New England winters, literature professor James Simmons chucked his 
job at Boston University in 1973 and started driving. About 13,000 miles and 
four months later, he turned off the freeway in San Diego and fell in love with 
the warm climate and postcard-perfect beaches. It took him another year to find 
out he could turn his passion for travel into a paying job. Now a free-lance 
writer specializing in adventure travel, he authors articles and books, 
including one on his favorite corners of the Earth and another about Americans 
as others see us. Simmons, a Pacific Beach resident, was interviewed by Times 
Staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Vince Compagnone.

 While I was teaching, I had been doing a lot of traveling on my own, but it 
was a real different kind of traveling from what I do now. I'd spend three 
months traveling through Asia by myself. It was pretty solitary, which was 
fine. But, once I started doing adventure travel with naturalists along, I was 
hooked. You get into a group of people with shared interests and it becomes a 
traveling seminar. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, I did the best trip I've ever done, a 30-day cruise to Antarctica 
which was real frontier at that time. There were about 80 of us on board, 
including six naturalists and Roger Tory Peterson, the No. 1 name in 
ornithology. We spent five days doing the first tourist exploration of South 
Georgia Island, which had been the center of the Antarctic whaling industry. 
That was all closed down, but everything was intact. You'd walk up to the dock, 
and all the whaling vessels were there with their big harpoon guns. There was 
the chart room, the dining room china, the galley. Sitting out in a mud bank 
was a well preserved, Norwegian three-masted whaling vessel from 1885. You'd go 
into the movie house, and the walls were all lined with posters advertising 
Randolph Scott Westerns from the '30s and a Gary Cooper film from 1943. 
</P>
<P>
We had some good weather, and we went south where the pack ice had split up. We 
went into areas where there were no docks and you had to go over the side of 
the ship in Zodiacs, which are small, 16-foot inflatable motorboats. Antarctica 
is so splendid. It has one of the great profusions of wildlife in the world. It 
has penguin rookeries where there are 2 million birds. There are no predators 
on land in Antarctica so you can walk right up and practically touch a penguin. 
It boggles the mind. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the most dangerous trip was the one down the Omo River in 
southwestern Ethiopia. We had a hippo attack on the boat. The Omo was the last 
pocket of territory to be explored by Westerners. I went in 1975 on the first 
commercial expedition, and the first natives we saw had never seen Westerners. 
It was Africa the way it was 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
We were 25 days on the river and covered about 300 miles. For the first half, 
we were at the bottom of a canyon at 4,000 feet, which had some splendid 
scenery and excellent white water. The second half was savannah country, and 
that's where the people were. The trip was wonderful but what made it dangerous 
is the difference between African river running and American river running. If 
you flip over in a raft at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, you know exactly 
what to do. You have your life jacket on, and you go into the rapids feet first 
and you come out. In Africa, when you come out in the calm water, you've got 
the crocodiles to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
We never had a boat flip, but you always knew if something happened, it'd be 
you and the crocodiles. They're big ones, 18 to 20 feet long, and we'd see six 
or eight of them at a time lying on the bank. We had these croc rocks so when 
the crocodiles came close to the boat we were supposed to shout obscenities and 
throw these croc rocks. That was a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the hippo attack, we were going through a place on the river 
called hippo alley where as many as 500 to 600 hippos have been counted passing 
through during the day. What hippos do in the heat of the day is walk on the 
bottom of the river. They come up every five minutes for air and then go back 
down. You have to be careful to stay in shallow water so you don't have hippos 
coming up underneath you. One of our boatmen got careless and wasn't in shallow 
water, and a hippo surfaced right along side of the boat. The hippo panicked. 
These enormous jaws opened and he bit down on the boat. He just missed a 
passenger by a foot. It was over in two seconds, and then the hippo was gone. 
We had to go ashore and fix the pontoon. We just all thought it was a great 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
In March, I spent my birthday on Pitcairn Island where the Bounty mutineers 
ended up in 1790. Pitcairn celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. We were 
the first cruise boat to stay overnight. It was interesting seeing Pitcairn 
through Pitcairn eyes. At the top of a hill was a house, so we asked them about 
that. That's our vacation house, they said. That's where we come when we want 
to get away from the sound of the sea. It's fascinating because everywhere you 
turn there's the ghost of the Bounty. In the town square there's an anchor from 
the Bounty. In one of the houses, there's was a canon from the Bounty. The 
Bible from the Bounty is in the church. One of the very earliest homes is built 
from the planks of the Bounty. Nearly half of the population has the last name 
of Fletcher Christian. You can see the cave where he hid out. It's a 
ghost-ridden island. That's why they landed there; it was uninhabited. It is 
way off the shipping lanes. I love end-of-the-world places.

   Hickory, dickory, dock. The mice are
eating the pot.
   The Shelby County Sheriff's Department says a gang of rodents has
infiltrated the agency's storage room and pilfered bags of marijuana
kept as evidence for upcoming trials.
   Authorities believe the perpetrators are mice seeking refuge from
the cold. It's not the first time this has happened, said Sheriff
Rick D. Isgrigg. ``But this year is the worst,'' he said.
   The rodents have chewed through several 29-ounce and 1-pound bags
of marijuana.
   ``They're playing havoc with the stuff,'' Isgrigg said Tuesday.
``From all indications, they must be rolling in it.''
   The mice have discriminating tastes, however. They've passed up a
bag of potato chips held as evidence in a grocery burglary, in this
area southeast of Indianapolis.
   Because the pests refuse to rat on each other, Isgrigg has placed
mounds of rodent-killer in the 20-by-25-foot property room.
   ``We have to nip this in the bud _ or nip it in the bag,'' the
sheriff said.

   Now that he's captured, if the legendary
``16-foot Wadsworth gator'' could talk he might tell these residents
east of Reno a couple of things.
   First, he's a South American caiman who's only 3 feet long and 10
pounds.
   Second, he likes cheeseburgers much better than the chicken bait
that's been set out for him as lures in the Truckee River where's
he's been vacationing for the past few weeks.
   Nevada Game Warden Steve Albert took custody Tuesday of the
caiman, a reptile cousin of the alligator. Albert said he would try
to find a new home for the caiman in a zoo or aquarium.
   The reptile was first spotted in the river Oct. 14 and was
probably dumped there by someone who tired of it as a pet, Albert
said.
   Since the first sighting, Wadsworth residents had believed that
the reptile was an alligator. The town's storytellers eventually
talked the legendary beast up to a 16-footer.
   The state Department of Wildlife became involved and set chicken
meat bait traps along the river, but to no avail.
   But last week, Robert Lester, 22, of Sparks and John Warner, 26,
of Reno captured the caiman while fishing for trout.
   Warner said he kept the caiman in his bathtub and fed it
cheeseburgers hoping to make him a pet, even though that's illegal
in Nevada.
   But Warner finally decided to give up the caiman and collect a
$500 reward a Reno businessman had put up for the ``Wadsworth
gator.''
   Eddie Floyd, a University of Florida alumnus, said he offered the
money because the alligator is the mascot of the university's sports
team.
   Floyd paid the reward Tuesday then immediately gave up custody of
the caiman to wildlife officials.
   ``I can't take it back to Florida because there are no Florida
Fightin' Caimans,'' Floyd lamented. ``But I'm glad it's OK just the
same.''

   Every time Don Anderson steps up to a game on
the North Georgia Fair midway, some needy or sick child can start
looking for a new stuffed animal.
   Anderson has gotten so good at the games, he wins a new toy just
about every time he toes the line at the ring toss or milk can game.
   Anderson has won an average of 50 stuffed animals each year at
the North Georgia Fair. This year, he won 78.
   Many of the green frogs, purple pandas and brown bears from this
year's fair are strewn around the Anderson home in Dalton.
   Most are awaiting auction at the Dalton Shrine Club, over which
Anderson presides. Proceeds from the auction are donated to the
Scottish Rite Children's Hospital in Atlanta. Other stuffed toys
will be donated directly to children at the hospital.
   The remaining stuffed animals will become Christmas presents for
needy families in the Dalton area.
   Anderson, the 40-year-old co-owner of a carpet outlet, got hooked
on playing midway games when he and his family visited Opryland in
Nashville, Tenn. Playing a game called Whack-A-Mole, he found he
could wield a cleaver and bash the mechanical ``moles'' with ease.
   ``I have quick reflexes,'' he said.
   He estimated he spent $150 to $160 playing the games this year.
   ``He'd rather do this than go on vacation,'' his wife said.

   The deadliest bus accident recorded in the Guinness Book of
World Records occurred in 1973 in Egypt, when a bus plunged into a
canal, killing 127 people.
   What is believed to be the worst bus accident in U.S. history
occurred on Sept. 17, 1963, when a bus collided with a train near
Salinas, Calif., killing 32 farm workers.
   Here is a list of some other recent domestic bus accidents:

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: THE EYES WILL HAVE IT IN BRAZIL'S LUSH PANTANAL 
</P>

Post News Service and an adventure traveler.

PORTO JOFRE, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the blackness that made the brilliant eyes so captivating. At the end of 
my flashlight beam, like glowing embers on a sea of black velvet, the 
fire-orange eyes of a thousand caimans reflected back at me. 
</P>
<P>
Under a starry sky, the field stretching out before me seemed to practically 
grow caimans -- enormous toothy reptiles that are often mistaken for 
alligators. Every sweep of the flashlight lit up scores of eyes, some not 20 
yards from the raised dirt road where I stood. 
</P>
<P>
The eerie sight of the caimans was just one of many unforgettable sights that 
greeted me at seemingly every turn in the 150,000-square-mile wetlands at the 
center of South America, an area called the Pantanal. 
</P>
<P>
Although lacking the fame of the Amazon, the Pantanal is home to at least 1,100 
species of butterflies, 400 species of fish, 650 species of birds and 80 
species of mammals. According to the World Wildlife Fund, only East Africa's 
savannas offer more in natural richness, both of flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Pantano means "swamp" in Portuguese, but in fact the Pantanal is not a swamp at 
all. Rather, it is the world's largest wetland -- a single, low-lying ecosystem 
formed by the dozens of rivers that flow into the mighty Paraguay River. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the season, the Pantanal is either flooded or drying out. During 
the dry season, from May to November, vast expanses of savannas are exposed. 
During the rainy season, from December to April, the rivers swell and deep mud 
and washed-out bridges often halt traffic on the Transpantaneira. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling across the Pantanal is like having pages of the National Geographic 
come to life around you. 
</P>
<P>
Exotic birds dart from spindly trees. Caimans plunge into waters that are milk 
chocolate in color. Giant anteaters lasso termites with their footlong tongues. 
Fishermen under broad straw hats sweep rivers in dugout canoes, catching 
20-pound catfish and filling baskets with piranha. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its fantastic beauty, the Pantanal has been a great unknown until 
recent years. Lack of roads kept the Pantanal's wildlife-rich inner delta, an 
area about the size of Britain in central-west Brazil, out of reach to all but 
the most zealous explorers. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1974 that an elevated dirt road -- the Transpantaneira -- was 
completed, linking the Pantanal's interior with its northern boundary at the 
town of Pocone. Still, it wasn't until just three years ago that tourists 
outnumbered scientists visiting the area. 
</P>
<P>
I flew to the nearest city -- Cuiaba -- in late June during the dry season, 
when wildlife in the Pantanal can best be seen. With a bottle of local rum, 
three cameras and a guide, Luiz Roberto, who could identify what seemed like a 
million animals, I set out for a weeklong adventure into the New World's 
largest breeding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour's drive past 10-home villages and miles of parched, rugged 
country, we arrived in dusty Pocone and loaded up on soft drinks -- ammo 
against 95-degree days. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Pocone, a carved sign hung over the road announcing the beginning 
of the Transpantaneira, and it might well have included the message: "Where 
city dwellers become nature lovers." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had we begun our journey into the heart of lightness than we slowed 
to cross one of the 123 wooden bridges on the Transpantaneira, which stretches 
90 miles from Pocone to Porto Jofre. 
</P>
<P>
From our Land Cruiser we peered into ponds on both sides of the bridge, and to 
my pleasant astonishment, we spied the first of hundreds of caimans we would 
see in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
By day, literally millions of Pantanal caimans take sun beside waterways and 
marshy pools. At dusk, they submerge to feast on piranha and an occasional land 
animal ambushed while drinking at water's edge. Whether seen by day or by 
night, the toothy reptiles, some up to 10 feet long, are an impressive sight. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes past the bridge we came upon a towering tree that wore its leaves 
like crowns on its highest branches. About two-thirds of the way up the tree, 
where the trunk finally flared off into branches, two jabiru storks -- white 
birds measuring a full four feet tall with scarlet collars, black hoods and 
six-foot wingspans -- had built a nest the width of a desk. 
</P>
<P>
On a nearby branch, a crested quero-quero -- a hawklike bird named after its 
sound -- "I want, I want" -- eyed the nest's eggs. Should the storks, who mate 
for life, abandon their nest even for a minute, it would spell certain death 
for their offspring, Luiz said. 
</P>
<P>
In the miles that followed, we came upon kingfishers, yellow-beaked toucans, 
roseate spoonbills, American wood storks, tiger herons, spectacled owls and 
more than a few macaws. 
</P>
<P>
Without even leaving the truck, we also spotted marsh deer, two giant anteaters 
and dozens of capybaras -- web-footed rodents the size of wart hogs with 
guinea-pig faces and bearlike coats. There were other animals, but simply to 
list them does not do justice to the pleasing emotions they evoke when seen in 
sweeping savannah unspoiled by man's often-destructive touch. 
</P>
<P>
We spent our first night at the Hotel Pixaim, a 10-room lodge with bath, good 
food and a friendly staff. Typical of the Pantanal's hotels, this one was clean 
and comfortable though lacking in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Built on stilts at a bend in the River Pixaim, the hotel rises above a marshy 
area popular with caimans. At night, amid the sounds of crickets, bullfrogs, 
owls and monkeys, I could sometimes hear the rustle of caimans beneath me. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, like most of my mornings in the Pantanal, began with Luiz and 
me racing out to a vantage point he knew to watch a breathtaking sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun broke, the siren of a million crickets would be joined by a 
cacophony of birdcalls. Monkeys entered the ruckus with howls that reached a 
crescendo. It was like a movie soundtrack played at full volume, quieting as 
sunlight swept the plain. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the day would be spent cruising the Transpantaneira or paddling 
around in a canoe, which took us down narrow waterways far from the road and 
into lowland rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Gliding quietly in a canoe allowed us to slip unnoticed beneath leaning trees 
bustling with howler monkeys and common iguanas. In front of the canoe, dorados 
and pacus -- fish often weighing 20 pounds or more -- heaved themselves out of 
the muddy water to announce their presence, while scores of birds, many with 
long, elegant wings, flew an arm's length above the river. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Luiz and I took a canoe out with an old Pantaneiro who could spot 
monkeys in trees before I could see them with my 200-millimeter lens. He 
pointed out a clearing where a jaguar had been, and once we paddled to within 
20 feet of a family of capybaras before the giant rodents ran off. 
</P>
<P>
Often I'd see what appeared to be the head of a snake poking out of the water, 
only to be told it was a snake bird -- a semi-aquatic bird whose head resembles 
a bushmaster when the bird comes up for air. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, with Luiz translating, we'd stop and chat with locals. One, a 
young biologist, was most anxious to criticize sport fishermen for depleting 
the rivers' stocks; most ignore fishing limits, he said, leaving the area with 
hundreds of animals caught in a single weekend.

On our last night in the Pantanal, Luiz and I drove back to Pocone, then headed 
east about 30 miles to the tiny village of Porto Cercado, where we climbed into 
a motorized canoe that would take us upriver to Cabanas do Pantanal, an 18-room 
lodge accessible only by boat. 
</P>
<P>
In the blackness of the moonless night, our canoe shot across piranha-filled 
water ringed by caiman. Our boatman flicked on a flashlight every so often 
during the 20-minute ride to warn other boatmen of our presence. 
</P>
<P>
On the shores, dusk had turned the ivy-covered trees into menacing silhouettes, 
and fireflies flitted off and on like grandma's white Christmas lights. It was 
Disneyland's "Pirates of the Caribbean" minus the pirates, at a wind-whipped 30 
knots. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel would have met Hemingway's approval. Its ceiling sagged, and the 
walls were boards of bright wood decorated with colorful maps of the Pantanal 
and photos of the area's wildlife, including jaguars, ocelots, anacondas and, 
of course, caimans. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the bar were jars containing cachaca -- clear and punchy Brazilian rum. 
Each jar also contained an oddity such as a root or piece of bark, stuff that 
when aged in cachaca is said to produce a concoction that will increase 
potency, produce arms of steel and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's bedrooms were nothing special, but there was a gorgeous lime-green 
tree frog clinging to my shower wall and, perched on a ledge near the ceiling, 
a small snake giving the frog a good look. 
</P>
<P>
That night, like most we spent in the Pantanal, we drank cachaca in a fire's 
glow and recounted the day's exotic sightings 
</P>
<P>
Monkeys playing . . . fish leaping . . . exotic birds in flight . . . scenes as 
memorable as the field of caimans that peered into my flashlight a few light 
years from civilization.

   Forming the world's longest conga line with almost
120,000 dancers was no problem Sunday for members of the crowd that
filled the streets of Little Havana for the Calle Ocho festival.
   ``It's very easy: Just face toward downtown, grab the shoulders
of the person in front of you _ and dance,'' Juan Carlos Sanchez,
organizer of the event.
   Anna Nicholas, a representative of the Guinness Book of World
Records, confirmed a record had been set at 119,986 dancers,
shattering the old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August
in Canada.
   ``There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we
just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said Nuvia Valdez, one of
about 1.5 million who turned out for the food and fun of what is
billed as the nation's largest Hispanic festival.
   The river of people along 23 blocks of Eighth Street _ Calle
Ocho in Spanish _ began to move when Gloria Estefan and the Miami
Sound Machine blared their hit ``Conga'' from loudspeakers.
   On the street, 96 volunteers with bullhorns attempted to direct
the traffic of dancing feet, while Ms. Estefan shouted to the
crowd: ``Is everybody ready? Let's conga!'' A special computer
program helped count the dancers, and 30 observation posts were set
up.
   Since the street was clogged, forming a single line was
difficult, and untold thousands of people formed in a bevy of
smaller lines in addition to the mega-line that made the Guinness
tally.
   ``I've never seen this many people in one place in my life,''
said Jean-Louis Levasseur, who was vacationing from New Brunswick,
Canada. ``There's more people on this one street than in all of the
Maritime Provinces.''

   Like many people who have ``a certain age,''
Maggie Grubb Lambeth gets a little offended when asked how old she
is.
   ``I'm not that old,'' said Mrs. Lambeth, who along with her
identical twin sister turned 105 on Friday.
   Mrs. Lambeth's sister, Allie Grubb Hill, doesn't mind talking
about her age, but then she's a few minutes younger.
   The sisters, who are listed as the world's oldest living
identical twins by the Guinness Book of World Records, celebrated at
their home in the Mountain Vista Health Park. The two women lived in
Davidson County all their lives, never more than two miles apart,
and moved to the rest home two years ago.
   ``It's the Lord that has kept us here this long,'' Mrs. Hill said.
   Between them, Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Lambeth had 20 children, 15 of
whom are living. They have 48 grandchildren, 90 great-grandchildren
and 31 great-great-grandchildren.
   Hazel Briles, 67, the second-youngest of Mrs. Lambeth's nine
children, said her mother kept her house spotless and her yard raked
until she was in her 90s.
   ``She just enjoyed doing things like that,'' Mrs. Briles said.
``She was a real active person. Most everybody in our family is real
active.''
   The two sisters rely on each other for companionship, and somehow
manage to keep each other going, Mrs. Briles said.
   ``They just don't make them like that anymore,'' she said.

   Fifteen gifts that blew off the roof of a van
on Interstate 80 on Christmas Eve have been returned to a couple by
a state roads worker who tracked them down through a department
store label.
   Michael and Julianne Wiegel of Lafayette, Colo., lost the
Christmas presents as they drove through Nebraska but did not
discover the gifts were missing until they arrived at the home of
relatives in Wisconsin.
   ``I was in tears,'' Mrs. Wiegel said. ``At that point, I figured
a Nebraska wheat farmer probably would find them in his field next
spring.''
   David Luusua, a maintenance worker for the Nebraska Roads
Department, found the packages that same day, strewn along the
shoulder of Interstate 80 about a mile west of the Platte River
bridge, between Omaha and Lincoln.
   Jerry Johnson, maintenance office supervisor, said the workers
called the State Patrol, but no one claimed the gifts over the next
week or so. Johnson then began some detective work.
   ``Some of the packages had skidded on the pavement and I noticed
the wrapping on one had torn,'' Johnson said. ``I saw a label on one
of the boxes from a department catalog store and it was addressed to
a lady in Lafayette, Colo.''
   Johnson said he called the woman and told her what he had found
and she identified them.
   ``I was really surprised,'' Mrs. Wiegel said.

   Tourists could thank their lucky stars for
Friday the 13th at the Betsy Ross House.
   Nearly 600 people received 13-star flags Friday at the home of
the woman who many believe designed the first American flag,
according to William Kingsley, executive director of the house a few
blocks from the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Kingsley said. ``We probably have five times
as many visitors as we did on a comparable day a year ago. The
weather is good and that helps.''
   Visitors received 12-inch-by-18-inch flags, which the house also
hands out each Flag Day.
   They included a tour bus from a New York high school for Hispanic
and Far Eastern immigrants, who received an extra flag for their
principal. Kingsley said the group's teacher had told the students
in Spanish to thank Kingsley in English.
   ``It was touching,'' he said.

   The stakes in world-champion
banana-split making got a bit higher _ er, longer _ thanks to the
determined residents of this central Pennsylvania town.
   Using 33,000 bananas, 2,500 gallons of ice cream and 150 gallons
of chocolate syrup, Selinsgrove made a 4.5-mile-long banana split
Saturday in a bid to regain a place in the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   ``It's something for the town to say, `When we work together,
anything is possible,''' said Kelly Stoops, a Selinsgrove teacher
who organized the event to raise money for a community development
organization.
   About 24,000 people standing and sitting in front of one-foot
sections of the 12.6 million-calorie dessert dug in at 4:30 p.m.
Each paid $2 for the privilege.
   ``It was getting pretty soupy after a while,'' said Robert Linn
of New Berlin, who was standing near the middle of the giant split,
made in three sections up Market Street through the center of this
town of 5,500 residents.
   Selinsgrove set the record for the world's longest banana spilt
in 1982 with a 1.5-mile concoction, winning a place in the 1983
Guinness Book.
   But in 1983, New York high school students created a banana
split a tenth of a mile longer.
   Selinsgrove on Saturday outdid Zeta Beta Tau Sorority at Bowling
Green University in Ohio, which created a 4-mile banana split in
1985, organizers said.
   A surveying company would verify the length of the banana split
and send the results to Guinness.
   Six hundred captains each produced 40-foot sections of the
dessert, made in a cardboard trough from empty carpet rolls.
   In addition to the ice cream, bananas and chocolate sauce,
organizers sprinkled on 600 pounds of chopped nuts, 150 gallons
each of strawberries and pineapples and 24,000 cherries.

   If all the quarters given away to
casino customers here last year were combined in one roll, the
package would stretch from Atlantic City to the outskirts of St.
Louis, more than 917 miles.
   Customers received more than $218.4 million, or 10.9 million
pounds, in complimentary quarters last year just for walking in the
doors of the city's 12 casinos, according to financial reports the
gaming halls filed with the state Casino Control Commission.
   That translates into more than 873.6 million quarters _ more
quarters than the U.S. Mint made in 1978, the year the first casino
opened here.
   ``No wonder we can't get change people,'' one casino official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, quipped, referring to the
industry's difficulty in finding enough workers to sell coins on
casino floors.

   They tasted, tossed, and generally
touted horseradish at an outdoor bash in this Southern Illinois
community to honor the tangy root.
   ``We grow one-half to two-thirds of the world's crop in this
area. We think that's something,'' said Craig Keller, president of
the Tri-County Vegetable Growers Association, which sponsored the
first International Horseradish Festival on Saturday to promote
Madison County as the horseradish capital of the world.
   Both horseradish connoisseurs and novices strolled past the food
booths and displays in a Collinsville park.
   ``I love horseradish,'' said Melvin Lytle, 67, of Edwardsville.
``It clears the sinuses. And they say it's an aphrodisiac.''
   ``Honey and horseradish makes a good cough medicine,'' added his
wife, Helen, 66.
   In addition to tasting recipes made with horseradish, some
people participated in the Horseradish Olympics _ which included a
root toss, where contestants tried to lob foot-long horseradish
roots farther than anyone else, and a hot dog eating contest. The
dogs, of course, were slathered with horseradish.

   If the Supreme Court wants to plunge back into
the abortion issue after the Webster dispute, three cases _ from
Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota _ now pending before the justices offer
immediate opportunities.
   Any of the three could lead the court to re-evaluate its 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision, which said women have a constitutional right to
seek and obtain abortions.
   The court already is assessing a woman's abortion rights in a
Missouri case called Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. No
decision was announced in the Webster case today, but the court said
its 1988-89 term will end on Monday.
   A decision could come then, or the justices could choose to
request new arguments during the next term.
   If one or more of the other three cases is granted review before
the end of the court's current term or early in the 1989-90 term
that begins next October, a decision likely would be announced
sometime in 1990.
   Of the three pending cases, the Illinois dispute might affect Roe
vs. Wade most directly. It would be extremely difficult for the
court to revive the Illinois laws without substantially dismantling
its 1973 decision.
   Th's accident, fishermen were free
today to harvest shellfish from parts of the upper Narragansett Bay.
Officials said almost all the oil had evaporated.
   In two other spills, cleanup crews made headway in mopping up oil.
   Iakovos Georgudis 43, was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanor
counts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of the
Clean Water Act and Federal Refuse Act. The captain also is under
investigation by a state grand jury.
   Each misdemeanor carries up to a year in prison and a $100,000
fine or double the actual damages, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln
Almond. The Coast Guard has estimated damages at $1.6 million, and
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said President Bush has promised full federal
reimbursement to the state.
   The Clean Water Act prohibits the negligent discharge of
pollutants; the Refuse Act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse
into navigable water without a permit.
   Almond said that Georgudis, a Greek resident, was arrested
because of concern that he might leave the United States. The United
States' extradition treaty with Greece does not cover pollution
crimes, he said.
   A federal magistrate set bail at $50,000 and ordered him to
surrender his passport. The magistrate also ordered that the captain
and his Greek tanker World Prodigy remain in Rhode Island waters.
   Almond said Georgudis was confined to the ship ``to insure the
integrity of the vesssel.''
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, witnesses at a Coast Guard inquiry
into a spill of about 300,000 gallons on the Delaware River said a
botched anchoring procedure led to the grounding of a tanker and the
spill of industrial heating oil. The hearing was recessed until July
5.
   The focus of the cleanup shifted today as changing winds directed
the oil from the Delaware side of the river toward New Jersey. By
this morning, 98 oil-covered birds had been brought to a rescue
center near Wilmington, Del.
   Coast Guard officials said the cleanup was going well partly
because rain and cooler weather helped congeal the oil, which had
begun to liquefy in the hot sun Tuesday. As of 8 p.m. Wednesday,
146,500 gallons of the estimated 306,000 gallons spilled had been
recovered, the Coast Guard said.
   In Texas, crews were nearly finished cleaning up a 250,000-gallon
oil spill that occurred Friday when a tanker and a barge collided in
the Houston Ship Channel, but the process has slowed a bit,
officials said.
   Only about 840 of the 252,000 gallons of oil that leaked remained
on the water this morning, but most of the slick was difficult to
reach, the Coast Guard said.
   Georgudis, who has admitted to Rhode Island's governor and Coast
Guard officials that he made a mistake in navigation, would not be
called to testify before a joint hearing by the Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety Board, said the chief investigator,
Coast Guard Capt. David Whitten.
   Whitten said Georgudis intends to invoke his Fifth Amendment
right to protect against self-incrimination.
   The World Prodigy's chief engineer, who does not face
prosecution, was expected to testify today. But Whitten said the
U.S. attorney's office had indicated that testimony by the chief
mate and helmsman could be delayed because of an unexplained snag in
obtaining immunity from prosecution.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said only that he was trying to
obtain approval for grants of immunity from Washington. He said he
did not know how long it would take.
   Georgudis' lawyer has said the captain would invoke the Fifth
Amendment if brought before the grand jury, which is investigating
possible violations of state pollution laws and a law requiring
harbor pilots aboard ships within Narragansett Bay.
   On Tuesday, helmsman Konstadinos Paraskevopulos invoked the Fifth
Amendment before the grand jury. But after being granted immunity,
he testified Wednesday. He declined to comment afterward.
   Georgudis also declined to comment.
   He said little during the hearing before U.S. Magistrate Jacob
Hagopian except to acknowledge that he spoke English and understood
the charges.
   Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf said the unloading of almost 8 million
gallons of oil remaining aboard the ship had been completed to five
barges, where the fuel would be purified.

<LEADPARA>  Prime Minister Khaleda Zia said Thursday that 100,000 people may have died in
the cyclone that pounded this low-lying country's densely populated coastal
areas Tuesday, leaving hunger, disease and homelessness in its wake.;    With
bodies washing ashore by the thousands and the government pleading for
international aid for millions of destitute survivors, the official death
toll, based on reports from the hardest-hit regions, crept toward 40,000.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But many of the victims were swept into the Bay of Bengal, and their bodies
will probably never be recovered.;    "It is a vast devastation, and the loss
of human lives could exceed 100,000," Zia said. "The information is
incomplete. We fear it could go up much more. I pray to Allah it's not true.";
   Relief workers and journalists who visited the stricken area in the
southeast, dominated by ragged islands and river deltas, said the tides were
bringing in thousands of bodies. Survivors searched for relatives among the
corpses piled on beaches.;    The impoverished government struggled to ferry
food, water and medicine to the survivors, but vast areas hit by the cyclone
were inaccessible. Helicopters dropped essentials to people huddled on the
rooftops of marooned buildings.;    Lutfar Rahman Khan, the minister of state
for relief and rehabilitation, said Thursday of the death toll, "I would not
be surprised if the total exceeds 100,000.";    The government has appealed
for international help to buy food, clothing, shelter and at least 20 large
helicopters to deliver the relief supplies, he said.;    About 10 million
people out of a population of 118 million have been uprooted by the storm,
which roared across the region with 145-mph winds.;    The most devastated
stretch of shoreline was around the town of Cox's Bazar and on nearby islands,
where 95 percent of the houses were destroyed.;    All along the southeast
coast, brackish water has ruined drinking supplies. Roads have been severely
damaged and phone communications are cut off.;    The sea has destroyed
thousands of acres of rice crops that were almost ready for harvest.;   
Experts said land flooded with salt water may be unworkable for two or three
years, with grave consequences for Bangladesh's struggling agricultural
economy.;    Shrimp farms, salt pans and fishing fleets, all major sources of
employment, have been blown apart. Damage to fledgling industries, including
an oil refinery, has not yet been assessed.;    In the port of Chittagong,
eight ships, at least one belonging to the small Bangladesh navy, have sunk,
blocking the only harbor that the country can use for berthing large vessels
bringing in relief supplies.;    Khan said Bangladesh "desperately" needed
foreign expertise in clearing the port.;    He said hospitals and schools were
destroyed, leaving no place to shelter and treat the homeless.;    More than
100,000 people have no cover at all, not even tents or lean-tos under which
they could sleep. Health hazards are considered potentially disastrous in this
hot, humid climate.;    Three C-130 cargo planes were expected to arrive in
the capital city of Dhaka with relief supplies from Saudi Arabia, one of the
largest donors of aid to predominantly Muslim Bangladesh.;    But Bangladesh
has only six functioning helicopters, most of them too small to ferry much
equipment to the neediest areas.;    Two light fixed-wing planes have dropped
some dry food and clothing -- 40,000 saris for women and 20,000 sarongs for
men -- in plastic bags from low altitudes.;    No planes can land on the
estuary islands, which are still knee- to chest-deep in water, officials say.;
   Relief workers will try today to use small boats to deliver food and water
to offshore islands.;    Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis have been
living on relatively new silt islands in the estuaries of rivers in defiance
of the law. They have fled there over the years in desperation, for land has
long ago run out in this extremely poor and densely populated nation.;    Many
Bangladeshis on the islands were tending the cattle or crops of landlords who
live safely on the mainland.; HOW TO HELP THE CYCLONE VICTIMS; Here is a list

<TEXT>
   A paraplegic in a wheelchair, carrying fireworks
and samurai swords, lowered himself on a rope Monday from the
Brooklyn Bridge and dangled 75 feet above the East River for more
than an hour.
   Ramond Masa, 40, of the Bronx, who called himself ``America's
No. 1 Stuntman,'' claimed he had dangled from the 105-year-old
landmark for seven hours.
   His stunt forced traffic on the bridge to be halted as the
morning rush hour began. About 30 officers from the police harbor
unit, emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to
the bridge, which connects lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, after a
tugboat operator spotted Masa.
   He was eventually persuaded to lower himself to the river, where
he was guided onto a police launch.
   Masa said he did it because ``I wanted to inspire these guys (in
wheelchairs) to get up from the hospital, and do something for
their communities and their families.''
   He refused medical attention at New York Infirmary-Beekman
Downtown Hospital and was taken to a police station, where he was
booked on charges of disorderly conduct, unlawful carrying of a
knife, and unlawful dealing with fireworks, according to police
spokesman Sgt. John Clifford.
   Masa, a large man with huge biceps and broad shoulders who also
uses the name El-Shah Muhammed El-Ratuli, was given a summons for a
Sept. 19 court date and released.
   The man, whose legs are paralyzed, initially told reporters his
name was ``Megaman.'' He handed out red, white and blue business
cards that proclaimed, ``Living on the edge is my business _
American No. 1 Stuntmen.''
   Masa said he lost the use of his legs when he was shot by a
sniper in 1977. He said his dangle off the Brooklyn Bridge was his
first experience as a stuntman.
   ``I planned for three months to do something real crazy to get
into the Guinness record book,'' he said. After a short vacation,
Masa said he plans to ``hang on the Statue of Liberty or the World
Trade Center. Maybe I'll take a shot at the Eiffel Tower in
France.''
   Masa said he was dropped off in the center of the span at about
midnight by his brother, whom he refused to identify.
   Dragging his wheelchair and two nylon bags containing the swords
and firecrackers behind him, Masa crawled to the edge of the span,
where he tied a nylon cord around his waist, through the wheelchair
and secured it to a five-inch thick piece of bridgework. Then, he
pushed the wheelchair off the bridge and shimmied down the rope
after it.
   He was noticed by a passing tugboat, which notified police about
dawn.
   ``He had looped it in some way that he could go down the rope
sitting in a wheelchair,'' said police Capt. William Plackenmeyer.
   Masa said he had planned to don a Ninja costume, light the six
super M-80's _ the equivalent of about 1{ sticks of dynamite _ and
hold the two samurai swords, each about three feet long, before he
jumped into the East River.
   He abandoned that plan after the two nylon bags containing his
gear fell into the river during the rescue effort.
   Masa expressed no remorse over the traffic jam. ``This is New
York. They (the commuters) like the excitement on Monday morning.''

   Divers retrieved 13 more bodies today
from a train that derailed on a bridge and tumbled into a lake,
raising the death toll to 103, government and navy officials said.
   The divers used gas torches to cut open a last passenger car
that could not be searched immediately after the accident on
Friday. There had been fears that as many as 50 passengers were
trapped in the car when it plunged into the water.
   But Vice Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas, chief of the Southern
Naval Command, said he believed most victims had been found.
   ``We have searched the entire lot,'' he said after returning
from the accident scene. ``It is most unlikely that we will find
any more bodies, though there may be odd ones stuck somewhere.''
   However, teams of navy divers kept looking for bodies in the
20-to 30-foot water as far as 400 yards from the sunken wreckage.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia today ordered a formal
inquiry into the derailment.
   He told a news conference after visiting the crash site that
families of victims would be compensated, the United News of India
reported.
   Nine cars of the 14-car Island Express derailed Friday on a
bridge over Lake Asthamudi near the town of Quilon in Kerala state,
about 1,200 miles south of New Delhi.
   Abdul Latif, additional district magistrate in Quilon, said most
victims died of drowning.
   At least 167 people remained hospitalized today, he said.
Officials had said after the train wrecked that 500 people were
injured, but most of the injured were treated for minor injuries
and released.
   Efforts to recover the bodies continued into the night under
floodlights, but had to be called off at 10 p.m. because of rain
and poor visibility. The search resumed this morning.
   Six of the brick-red cars were partly or fully submerged in the
water, and three hung from the bridge, which is about 15 feet above
the lake. The engine and the following luggage car crossed the
bridge safely, and the last four cars did not go off the trestle.
   Fishermen in long, narrow boats were the first to reach the
scene, and the rescue official said they saved more than 200 people
from drowning.
   The rescue official said 36 divers from the Naval Base at
Cochin, 70 miles northwest of the accident site, continued the
rescue effort.
   The railway administration still does not know how many people
were aboard the train bound from Bangalore in neighboring Karnataka
state to Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala and about 30 miles south
of Quilon.
   Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a
cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment, but Railways
Ministry officials said the cause had yet to be determined.
   Matthew John, a railway safety official, said two spans of the
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as
the train cars plunged into the water.
   Witnesses told Indian news agencies that the train engineer
jammed on the brakes just before the derailment. But Subramaniam
said, ``It wouldn't cause a disaster of this magnitude.''
   The Indian railway system, second largest in the world and
carrying 9 million passengers daily, has been plagued with
accidents.
   According to a report to Parliament in February, 227 people were
killed in 613 train accidents during 1987.
   The world's worst train accident occurred in India, according to
the Guinness Book of World Records. More than 800 people were
killed when a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the
eastern state of Bihar in June 1981, Guinness says.

   Dave Simon hopes his company's ``Belle
of Wisconsin'' will one day be listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the world's largest hunk of Cheddar cheese.
   Belle, measuring 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 20 feet long and
weighing 40,060 pounds, was unveiled this weekend in Little Chute
and Madison, where it was transported in a tailor-made Cheesemobile.
   The cheese, manufactured by Simon and his 35 employees at
Simon's Specialty Cheese, was the product of 7,000 cows. It two
days' worth of milk production from 60 dairy farms. It will be cut
into one-pound blocks and sold in about a year.
   Depending on how quickly it ages, the colossal cheese should
retail at about $150,000, according to the Wisconsin Cheese Makers
Association.
   ``We never had any problems. When we were taking it out of the
cooler, though, we only had one-sixteenth of an inch of clearance
on both sides as it came through the doors,''said Gary Romenesko,
sales manager at Simon's.
   Belle should set a new Guinness record, surpassing the
34,591-pound ``Golden Giant'' displayed at the 1964 World's Fair by
the Cheese Maker's Association.
   The cheese will tour the United States, stopping at grocery
stores, state fairs and special events along the way, according to
its creators.

   A 300-pound piano dangling 200 feet in
the air from a helicopter came down and went thud, crash, kapow,
bang.
   But there were no sour notes in those sounds as 300 friends of
the late John Cameron ``J.C.'' Young used $2,000 of the money left
to them in Young's will to have the musical instrument dropped from
the sky Saturday in his honor. A big party was scheduled afterward.
   The crazy event was just the sort of thing Young would have
liked, and in fact, he once helped arrange a piano drop while a
student at the University of Washington, according to his friends.
   Jerry Reed, who described himself as Young's drinking buddy from
Sausalito, laughed heartily at the sound of the crash.
   ``It's the kind of thing he loved,'' said Reed. ``I think he
would have thought it was wild. Life was a crazy experience for
him, and he had his foot to the floorboard.''
   Young, who owned several shops that sold foam furniture, died
under unexplained circumstances three years ago at age 44 when he
was found dead in his car at the bottom of a ravine.
   His will specified that $15,000 from his estate, valued at
$800,000, go to throw a party for his friends. Young owned several
shops that sold foam furniture.

   Although their wedding appeared
traditional, Bryan Hill and Sohn-Ho Sohn traveled an unlikely road
to marriage.
   The two former pen pals were married Saturday at St. Sebastian's
Congregation Church in this southeastern Wisconsin community.
   Hill, a Sturtevant native stationed at the U.S. Air Force base
in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said marriage was the last thing on his mind
when he began writing to Sohn in South Korea five years ago.
   ``Through the letters, I learned about her,'' Hill said. ``We
didn't start out intending to get married.''
   Hill said he began writing Sohn in 1983 to help her learn
English. Sohn is a cousin of Hill's best friend's wife.
   The couple did not meet until 1986 when they spent two weeks
together. Hill said the short encounter convinced him Sohn was the
one to marry.
   ``My friends call me the last of the great romantics,'' Hill
said.
   ``We started by explaining each other's countries and sending
maps,'' he said. ``She would send poems and I'd send back poems and
stories.''

Souvenir Shopping Along the Sepik River

<TEXT>
    Bushy-haired Papuan
art-and-artifact peddlers sprawl on the ground in shabby
ankle-length cotton dresses before the thatched Haus
Tambaran, or spirit house. Battered umbrellas shield them
from the blistering sun as they trade gossip, nurse babies
and guard their wares.
   Before them lie ritual masks in bright colors, story boards relating jungle tales through carved symbols, spears tipped with cassowary claws, clay pots from the Chambri Lakes, shell and boars'-tusk necklaces, and carved shields. 
At the base of the slope, the Sepik River sweeps by, with swamp debris floating on its surface. 

   Most of the action around here is at the food stalls, where fish, breadfruit, bananas and yams sizzle in coconut oil. 
Artifact peddlers don't mind a slow day. 
This morning, they paddled up or down the Sepik in dugout canoes from their marshy villages. 
At day's end, they will return the same way with unsold goods, confident that government buyers will purchase offerings for export if nobody else does. 

   Along the river's 700 miles, it seems as if all of Papua New Guinea survives by carving and painting objects that turn to art in museums and galleries. 
Tourists also buy the work for souvenirs to lug home and show off to their friends. 

   Some items might need two people to tote them to the airline checkout counter, too. 
That would be only after each item has been fumigated to eliminate the termites and bugs that abound in this land of towering mountains, broad rivers and dense jungle. 

   Art remains art even when creatures exist on it. 
But few art lovers like sharing their treasures with hungry mites, nits, mastigophorans, amoeba, rhizopods and even-stranger forms of life. 

   Visitors do love New Guinean art, though, with its primitive imagery, brilliant colors and its ties to a spirit world of warring headhunters. 
A striking mask with glaring shell eyes and a pig's tusk stuck through the ocher painted nose finds a buyer even though he wonders uneasily if the piece bears a tribal curse. 

   Every Sepik River village has its distinctive style. 
The wooden masks from Koroga are decorated with clay embedded with shells and pigs' teeth. 
Wood carvers of the Murik Lakes chisel weird figures, half-man and half-nightmare creatures of the spirit world. 
Yessan features cassowary bone daggers and, sometimes, daggers carved from human bone. (Tribal warfare still explodes from time to time, and casualties occur.) 

   On the upper Sepik, villagers favor insect designs on masks and figures, with the praying mantis a popular motif. 
At Wombun, wooden masks are long and angular, their glossy black wood forming a background for white, incised patterns. 

   The spirit houses in each village are also elaborately decorated, with carved beams, ornately worked facades and painted bark-cloth ceilings. 
Men laze in the deep shadows within these houses, socializing, sometimes carving more spirit figures to join the house's collection. 

   There is plenty of art to lure the visitor, but getting here, and then getting from place to place, is not simple. 
Standard transport is the dugout canoe -- hacked from a single log, powered by paddle when used privately, by outboard motor on the river taxis. 
In such a cab, a visitor rides with chin on knees between a warrior with only his crotch covered and a trussed pig going to market. 
When the craft hits what looks like a log on the brown river, the dugout veers to the left and the "log" sinks beneath the surface. 

   "Puk-puk," says the warrior as he grabs a spear from the bottom of the craft and holds its tip poised above the water. 
The visitor looks back to where the "puk-puk," or crocodile, left scarcely a ripple on the water. 

   Far easier for river transport is the Melanesian Explorer. 
This is a 129-foot, 270-gross-ton vessel that plies the river and coastal islands. 
Built as a Japanese ferry boat about 50 years ago, it has been converted into a passenger boat of sorts. 
With a Fijian skipper, a Trobriand Islander cook and a Papuan crew, it reaches remote ports and villages thanks to its 7.5-foot draft. 

   It isn't a luxury liner. 
But you can escape the mosquitoes in a cabin, a cabin in which the air conditioning works most of the time. 
The ship is also a convenient way of getting the tall shields, the intricately carved kanu bowsprits, the tribal masks and other booty to the airstrip at Madang. 
The Madang Resort Hotel's staff is happy to package art and artifacts for shipping home. 

   Everybody on the Sepik now knows the Melanesian Explorer. 
When it drops anchor off a village, the whole population rushes to the bank, ready to help visitors clamber from tenders onto the shore. 
Every carving and artifact in the area is likely to be laid on the ground before thatch huts, all for sale at prices a fraction of those outside the country. 

   Not long ago, locals hunted crocodiles for cash to supplement their subsistence living. 
Today, most river people find it more profitable and much easier to serve the art and artifacts market than to face crocs at night on an unforgiving river. 
So their art grows ever more commercial, shaped to please visitors rather than the spirits hanging around a Haus Tambaran.

<HEAD>First Commercial Reactor Vessel Loaded and Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHIPPINGPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge pressure vessel from the
world's first dismantled commercial nuclear reactor is awaiting
better weather to begin its 8,100-mile journey through the Panama
Canal to Washington state for burial.
   The 1,000-ton vessel and neutron-shield tank from Shippingport,
the nation's first commercial nuclear plant, were packed in concrete
and lifted onto the 200-foot seagoing barge Paul Bunyan in the Ohio
River last week.
   The 60-day journey to the U.S. Energy Department dump at Hanford,
Wash., will begin in several weeks when officials can count on
better weather along its route down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
and through the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean, department
spokesman Tom Bauman said Wednesday.
   ``We're going to make very sure it's very safe for sea before we
ship it,'' he said. ``There will be no danger whatsoever. In fact,
the radioactivity levels are less than 1 percent of the standards
allowed for this type of (radioactive) shipment.''
   The reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site at
Shippingport, 30 miles from Pittsburgh, on Dec. 14 in the most
dramatic, although not necesarily the most critical, phase of the
five-year decommissioning.
   It was lifted by a crane, placed on a specially constructed
flatbed transporter with 320 rubber tires and rolled to the river
bank and the barge, which has a 4,000-ton capacity.
   The Shippingport plant was dedicated by President Eisenhower in
1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 6.5 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity.
   It is the world's only commercial reactor to be dismantled.
Several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed.
   The government hopes to show that reactors that have outlived
their usefulness can be dismantled safely and affordably.
   Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so
the site can be returned to unrestricted use. No decision has been
made as to how to use the land.
   The decommissioning is expected to be completed by 1990 at a cost
of about $98 million.
   The cylindrical reactor _ 41 feet long, 30 feet high and 18 feet
in diameter _ is composed of a pressure vessel with 8-inch steel
walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1{ inches
thick.
   Spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete to stabilize
it and reduce radioactivity.

   Oil rigs disguised as dinosaurs and four
giant red lobsters were the winning entries in a national design
contest to decorate a rundown gasoline station built in the
mid-1950s.
   The jury initially dismissed the lobster motif as ``too
whimsical,'' but ``we kept coming back to it, over and over,'' said
former Mayor Pamela Plumb, one of the judges. ``It would become the
Eiffel Tower of Portland,'' an instant landmark and potential
meeting place, she said.
   ``They're not token lobsters or trite gestures. They're blown up
to a scale where they're truly heroic,'' said Deborah Andrews,
another judge.
   The 60-foot-long and 20-foot-tall lobsters, each resting on a
giant canopy, were designed by Philadelphia architects Willis
Pember and Andrew Blanda.
   That design and the dinosaur entry from Architect William
Collett of Cambridge, Mass., were the winners in the Gateway Gas
Design Competition devised by the C.N. Brown Co., owner of the
dilapidated station.
   The two first-place winners announced Wednesday received $2,000
each. Residents in Portand will have a chance to comment about the
winners and 157 other entries.
   C.N. Brown is not obligated to use any of the designs when it
renovates the station. The contest came about when city planners
balked at the company's bid to use a standard Mobil Oil Corp.
design to replace the existing structure.
   Collett's design pays homage to fossil fuels. The roof is
reminiscent of prehistoric animals and appears to mimic the action
of oil drilling rigs when blown by the wind.

   Bobby Stephenson and his friends needed
something special to compete in the world's largest barbecue
cookoff. So they built a 53-foot-tall, two-ton, steel replica of
the Eiffel Tower.
   The cooking booth is this year's focal point at a Mississippi
River bluff where 175 barbecue teams will spend today through
Saturday cooking 25 tons of pork.
   The party includes a ``Miss Piggie'' beauty contest, a
hog-calling competition and a parade.
   Stephenson said his 22-member group, The Not Ready for Swine
Time Porkers, started working on their blue-and-white tower in
January.
   A 22-foot-square base forms the cooking booth's roof and a
second story observation tower. Next to the booth is a 7-foot-long
steel cooker with three cooking surfaces and plenty of space for a
whole hog.
   ``It got to be a bit more involved that my team had expected it
was going to be,'' Stephenson said.
   This year's contestants come from 22 states and France, Ireland,
Great Britain, Canada and the Soviet republic of Estonia.
   The Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest
is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest
event of its kind anywhere. The listing was based on the 55,747
pounds of pork cooked last year.

   A sandwich shop claims a 1,538-foot-long
submarine sandwich it made this weekend was the the world's
largest, complete with cold cuts, cheese, lettuce, tomato, olives
and onion on an Italian roll.
   Red Cross volunteers and employees of Subway Sandwiches And
Salads worked about 6{ hours at Richland Mall to make the sandwich,
which was 1,538 feet, 2 inches long, much larger than the current
record of 1,008 feet listed in the Guinness Book of World Records,
said Diane Micik, mall spokeswoman.
   It was one of several events scheduled to raise money for
American Red Cross disaster relief services.
   Also Saturday, Ken Solis, 31, of Greendale, Wis., took 71
minutes, 54 seconds to run 10 miles in the mall parking lot while
skipping rope, Ms. Micik said. The previous record was 76 minutes,
32 seconds, she said.

   Sal Piro has seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show
1,100 times. Diane Witt has auburn hair 10 feet long when straight
_ tresses even Rapunzel would envy.
   They, and the world's fastest talker, were among the guests at
Tuesday's official reopening of the Guinness Book of Records'
spruced-up museum of ``amazing feats and astonishing facts'' in the
Empire State Building.
   Since 1977, 250,000 visitors a year have slaked their curiosity
at the museum, forking over an admission price of $3.50 for adults
and $2.50 for children, director Ken Volk said.
   At the reopening, boxer Thomas Hearns of Detroit was inducted
into Guinness for earning world titles in four weight classes.
   ``I'm a very proud man at this moment,'' he said. ``This is
something that my kids can look upon.''
   Around him, Guinness alumni toasted the renovation amid replicas
of the world's biggest produce (carrot, 15 pounds 7 ounces, I.G.
Scott, New Zealand, 1978) and videotapes of human feeding frenzies
(100 yards of spaghetti, 27.75 seconds), complete with sounds of
swallowing and belching.
   Calliope music wafted from the circus exhibit as Marilyn vos
Savant _ whose IQ of 228 made her the world's smartest person _
fielded reporters' highbrow questions about intellect, intuition
and upbringing.
   ``I really do enjoy the Guinness book,'' insisted Savant, who
attended on the arm of her husband, artificial heart inventor Dr.

   Fran Capo of Queens, fast talker extraordinaire, showed her
stuff with a rapid-fire Biblical passage. ``I save money on

   Bruce Block of Cincinnati, a record-holder for balancing 135
cigar boxes on his chin, gave a 5-second demonstration; and Albert
Lucas of Las Vegas tossed around four tennis rackets to show how he

   Tom Harrington of Peekskill, leader of the World Domino
Spectacular Team, staged a topple. But Gary Stewart of Reading,

   Manhattan's Piro, who has seen the Rocky Horror Picture show
1,100 times, said, ``I only go twice a week. Some people go to the

   In his spare time, Piro, a writer, goes to other movies, plays
chess and watches TV. He's seen the soap opera ``All My Children''
every day for five years.

   Fans of strange facts and weird records can get
the latest on the longest, the biggest and the fastest with today's
publication of the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of Records.
   The annual edition is published early each year to catch early
Christmas sales.
   The latest 312-page volume lists milestones in sports, business,
science, nature and the arts. But the items that lure trivia buffs
to the book often fall into the more subjective category of the
bizarre.
   For example, among this year's landmarks are the longest
distance traveled while sleepwalking _ 100 miles. The honor goes to
12-year-old Michael Dixon of Danville, Ill., who hopped a freight
train to Peru, Indiana. He was found barefoot in his pajamas
wandering near a railroad track.
   Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who fell from grace because of
drug abuse at the Olympics, is listed the world's fastest man with
his 100-meter run of his time of 9.83 seconds at the World
Championships in Rome on Aug. 30, 1987.
   World records at the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, came too late to be included, and will go into the 1990
edition ``subject to them not being beaten,'' said Guinness Book of
Records' sports compiler Stewart Newport.
   However, he said, Johnson's world-record breaking 100-meter win
in Seoul will be reduced to a footnote that reads: ``Ben Johnson
ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 24,
1988, but was subsequently disqualified on a positive drugs test
for steroids.''
   The book lists the rarest breed of dog as the American hairless
terrier. At the last count in March, 68 of the known 70 specimens
were owned by Willie and Edwin Scott of Trout, La.
   An even rarer species was ``Super Frosty,'' the world's largest
snowman, built over two weeks last spring by a team in Anchorage,
Alaska. The snow giant stood 63.56 feet.
   If musically inclined, Super Frosty would probably want to play
the world's largest _ and presumably loudest _ guitar at 14 feet, 3
inches tall and weighing 309 pounds. It was built by Joe Kovacic of
Ontario, Canada.
   Other bits of information include the oldest sheep, 28 years;
the longest conga dance line, 119,986 people; most hands shaken,
19,592 in eight hours; the best best man, 408 marriages; and the
tallest woman, 7 feet 7 inches.
   The Guinness Book of Records was first compiled in 1955 by twins
Ross and Norris McWhirter as a depository of fact to become the
final arbiter in all arguments. By 1988, worldwide sales had
reached nearly 60 million in 262 editions in 31 languages.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   River levels were stable or receding
Thursday and the Dhaka airport reopened so relief supplies can be
flown in, but distribution of aid to flood victims was slow and the
death toll continued climbing.
   The government said 609 people have died in floods that began
with the annual monsoon season in June, tapered off, then resumed
in devastating fashion Aug. 27. Daily tallies by Dhaka newspapers
total more than 1,300, which is considered more accurate.
   Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman said Thursday 510 people
drowned, died of snake bites or were killed when their houses
collapsed. The government health center reported 99 deaths from
diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water that flooded
three-quarters of the country's 55,000 square miles.
   Health center officials reported 135,537 known cases of diarrhea
nationwide, an increase of 15,715 in the previous 24 hours, but
that includes only areas in communication with the capital.
   Officials say about one-quarter of Bangladesh's 110 million
people are homeless.
   Many still are stranded on rooftops, in boats and on the rare
patches of high ground in Bangladesh, most of which is a vast river
delta. Water levels in flood areas range from a few inches to more
than 10 feet.
   Rahman insisted there was no shortage of water purification
tablets, but his assertion seemed questionable.
   More than two dozen people interviewed at random Thursday in
relief camps, flooded buildings and on rooftops in Dhaka said they
had no purification tablets and were drinking water that could be
dangerous.
   ``Most of us have fevers and headaches,'' said Lily, a
17-year-old seamstress camping out at the Fair Fashion company
factory with 10 co-workers. She said they paid 31 cents a day for
about five gallons of tap water.
   Lily and a co-worker, 20-year-old Shamima, said they had heard
of water purification tablets, but Lily said ``No one has given us
any and we don't have enough money to buy any.''
   A diplomat from a Western nation that has tried to buy water
purification tablets for relief distribution reported searching in
vain for sufficient quantities in Bangladesh and nearby countries.
Representatives of other aid donors made similar reports, all on
condition of anonymity.
   Pledges of disaster aid reached a total of at least $60 million
Thursday, according to figures for individual nations reported by
Rahman, the information minister.
   Included are $16.9 million in goods and cash from Japan, $3.6
million from the United States, and $6.5 million each from France
and the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent
societies. Much of the aid will take the form of food, blankets and
medicine.
   Britain said it will send $11.9 million in new aid. The Foreign
Office said in London on Thursday that the aid supplements $800,000
already pledged.
   Prospects for getting it to Bangladesh brightened with the
opening of Dhaka's airport to all aircraft. More than half the
10,000-foot runway was flooded this week, and only helicopters and
smaller commercial aircraft were landing.
   The World Food Program issued a statement in Rome saying the
greatest problem is moving the aid to where it is needed.
   ``Relief distribution is being carried out by boats, barges and
tugs and a very limited number of helicopters,'' the U.N. agency
said. ``The government of Bangladesh has appealed for more
logistical assistance.''
   Rahman told reporters neighboring countries agreed to study the
flood problem in an effort to control the annual deluges carried by
rivers that originate in India and Nepal.
   He said the problem was put on the agenda of the December
meeting of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation.
   The three mightiest rivers that run through the country to the
Bay of Bengal are the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna.
   Floods are a problem every monsoon season, but the inundation
this year is the worst for many years in Bangladesh, whose rivers
cover 10 percent of its territory even in normal times.
   Rapid deforestation in India and Nepal has contributed to the
problem because bare soil cannot retain as much water, according to
geographers, government officials and U.N. specialists.
   A report from the Bangladesh flood warning and forecast center
said the Ganges and Meghna continued receding slightly Thursday and
the Brahmaputra held its level, with all three still above flood
stage.

   They may play in Peoria, but a line of logo
clothes for a local high school won't make it in the rest of the
country.
   A Kansas City, Mo., businessman who purchased the rights to use
the name and insignia of Peoria High School has given up his idea
for a line of clothing.
   ``It was an attempt to create a fad and it didn't happen,'' said
Fred Wolferman. ``It was clearly a long shot.''
   Wolferman said he wanted to market the Peoria High clothing as
an alternative to a Beverly Hills High School line introduced last
year by Twentieth Century Fox and the Great Southern Clothing Co.
of Macon, Ga.
   ``I tried a little test ad in the New Yorker and I didn't get
any response,'' Wolferman said. ``I deduced there was minimal
interest.''
   The idea of a Peoria High line of clothes came from a comment
made by promoters of the Beverly Hills clothing.
   Wolferman said he was offended on behalf of Peoria and the
Midwest when a promoter said his clothes were ``the closest most
kids in Peoria will ever feel they're a part of the Beverly Hills
High School attitude.''

   Jumping a water scooter hasn't
landed anyone in the Guinness Book of World Records, but Bill
``Iceman'' Matthews has taken a leap that he hopes will put him in
the book.
   Matthews made his bid without a practice run.
   ``What's the point?'' he said. ``You've just got to get out
there and do it.''
   Matthews rode a water scooter Thursday over a 20{-foot ramp and
flew 60{ feet into the water, making his jump an official 81 feet.
   He had the jump filmed and plans to submit the tapes to the
Guinness Book. Cyd Smith, a Guinness editor, said no records exist
for water scooters.
   Matthews, who makes a living jumping motorcycles and all-terrain
vehicles over cars and boats, said the jump was the first of a
planned series.

   A barge rammed into a pleasure boat, sheared off
the top deck and sank it in the River Thames early Sunday, killing
at least 26 people, police said. At least 78 people survived.
   The barge's captain and second mate were arrested, but police
later said the two would not be detained. It was not clear whether
charges would be filed.
   Police Commander John Purnell, speaking at Scotland Yard, said
the there were 26 people known dead, including one woman found
upstream. Most of the dead were teen-agers or in their 20s, he said.
   Earlier, police said 29 bodies had been found and there were 87
survivors. There was no explanation given for the discrepancy.
   The detective heading the inquiry, Michael Purchase, said earlier
the toll could be as high as 60.
   ``It could be days or even weeks before the full extent of the
tragedy is known,'' Purnell said.
   Scotland Yard said the engine room and bilges had still to be
searched for bodies. It said salvage crews found no survivors.
   Police said 78 people got off the vessel alive but it was unclear
how many people boarded the luxury river cruiser when it sailed at 1
a.m. on a clear, warm night, planning to return at dawn.
   The uncertainty of the casualty toll arose from the absence of a
passenger list and conflicting estimates of the numbers of people
aboard. Scotland Yard said the boat, licensed for 149 passengers and
two crew, was carrying 120 to 150 people. Ken Dwan, owner of the
Marchioness' company, said there were no more than 110.
   Guests had been celebrating the 26th birthday party for London
banker Antonio Vasconcellos when it sank near Southwark Bridge, in
the heart of the capital, friends said. Vasconcellos was unaccounted
for, police said.
   Dwan said the collision between the 80-ton double-decker river
boat and a dredger 18 times heavier was like ``a tank rolling over''
a small car.
   An inspection by divers showed the vessel's top deck was sheared
off.
   The huge Thames Barrier, built across the river near its mouth to
control seasonal flooding, was lowered to hold back the tide and
ease the treacherous conditions under which rescuers worked.
   The five additional crew members of the 1,475-ton Bowbelle, a
sand-and-gravel dredging barge, were questioned as witnesses about
the collision, Scotland Yard said.
   Survivors said people were dancing, socializing and enjoying the
floating birthday party when the Bowbelle, one of the largest
registered vessels on the Thames, crashed into the rear of the
Marchioness, knocking it sideways, then hitting it again and running
straight over it.
   The Marchioness sank within two minutes in 25 feet of water and
came to rest near Southwark Bridge, in central London's financial
district, shortly before 2 a.m., police said.
   Survivors said the 85-foot-long Marchioness, built during World
War II, was privately chartered by a London modeling agency,
Synchro. Vasconcellos was the guest of honor. The connection between
the agency and Vasconcellos was not immediately clear.
   Many of those dancing on the top deck jumped or were thrown
overboard, shouting and screaming, and battled strong tides to reach
shore. Others, disco-dancing below deck, were trapped.
   Art student Mike Mosbacher, 22, said he dived out of an open
window on the top deck when he saw the barge coming.
   ``It hit us in the side, smashed into us and went straight over
us,'' he said. ``The people downstairs, there's no way they would
have got out.''
   Survivors were taken to three local hospitals. Doctors said the
most serious injury was a broken leg.
   ``Everyone had been quite relaxed,'' said Annette Russell, 26.
``People were chatting and dancing to the music. It all happened
terribly quickly. We were rammed from behind ... and as we tried to
get out of the situation, I think the tide took the boat over and it
turned and sank.''
   The government ordered an inquiry and the search continued. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher returned from vacation in Austria and
immediately boarded a river patrol boat to visit the scene. Queen
Elizabeth II, vacationing in Scotland, sent condolences.
   The 260-foot-long Bowbelle, operated by South Coast Shipping,
works in the Thames estuary and the North Sea, a spokesman for the
firm said. He would not comment on the tragedy.

   A 3-year-old boy playing along the bank
of a river in the western Amazon jungle was crushed and swallowed
whole by a 45-foot anaconda, newspapers reported Monday.
   They said the boy's father tried in vain to save him from the
jaws of the anaconda, a long, heavy South American snake of the boa
family.
   ``The boy, Daniel Menezes, had accompanied his father, Joao, to
the river to catch fish. With fish in hand, the father started
walking to his small wooden shack a few feet away when he heard
screams. He looked back and he saw his son's neck in the jaws of
the snake,'' said Jorcene Martinez, a reporter for O Estadao
newspaper.
   Martinez spoke to The Associated Press by phone from the jungle
city of Porto Velho, 2,045 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
   He quoted the father as saying the incident occurred Aug. 8
along the Jaru River.
   ``It took the family two weeks to travel the more than 185 miles
to Porto Velho, where they told us what had happened,'' Martinez
said.
   He said the father rushed to his home, grabbed an old rifle and
``ran back to the river in a desperate attempt to save his son. But
when he got to the river he saw the anaconda had already crushed
his son's bones and had started swallowing the body. There was
nothing left to do.''
   Menezes is an impoverished peasant who plants ``manioc root and
hunts and fishes to feed his family,'' Martinez said.
   The Jaru winds through thick jungle and is infested with
man-eating piranha, alligators and snakes, Martinez said.
   The anaconda, one of the world's biggest non-poisonous snakes,
kills by crushing its victims, then swallows them whole.

<HEAD>Company To Donate Medicine To Treat River Blindness In 11 Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck &amp; Co. announced Wednesday it is donating
a new drug for the treatment of river blindness in 11 African
countries and will provide the drug ``as long as it takes to
eradicate this disease.''
   Art Kaufman, a Merck company spokesman, said an independent
committee of experts has approved a treatment program using the
drug, called Mectizan, and treatment of at least 250,000 people in
West Africa will start next year.
   A program for mass treatment in the 11 countries was developed by
the Onchocerciasis Control Program, an organization in West Africa.
The committee of experts, organized at the request of Merck,
examined the plan and approved it this week, Kaufman said.
   Other countries may receive the drug later if treatment programs
are approved by the committee of experts, he said.
   ``We plan to donate this drug as long as it is needed, as long as
it takes to eradicate this disease,'' said Kaufman.
   Kaufman said Merck had spent millions to develop the drug, but he
could not provide a figure for how much the drug distribution will
cost the company.
   River blindness, the informal name for onchocerciasis, is endemic
in 35 countries and affects an estimated 18 million people.
   The disease is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread to
victims through the bite of the blackfly. The blackfly thrives along
the banks of fast-moving rivers, hence the disease is informally
called river blindness.
   Typically, the disease is spread when a fly bites a person
infected with river blindness and picks up microfilariae, the
immature form of the parasitic worm. The parasite matures to an
infective larvae inside the fly and is introduced into a new human
victim when the fly bites again.
   Inside the human victim, the larvae matures to an adult worm,
sometimes growing to well over two feet in length, and produces
millions of microfilariae, which restart the cycle when a black fly
bites.
   Infected humans suffer from itching, weight loss, the growth of
nodules and a variety of lesions that eventually can cause blindness.
   World Health Organization officials estimate that about 340,000
have been blinded by the disease and that there are about 85 million
people in 35 developing countries who are at risk. The disease
occurs in large parts of West Africa, the Middle East and in Central
and South America.
   The 11 countries that will receive the initial shipment of the
Merck drug are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. All are in
West Africa.
   Protection from river blindness requires an annual treatment with
the drug. The drug works by killing the microfilariae and preventing
the adult worm from secreting more, thus preventing the major
symptoms of the disease and its transmission to other humans.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 4 (XINHUA) -- With the rapid economic 
growth along the Chang Jiang River, China's longest, the ports 
along the river have attracted more and more foreign ships. 
  On May 7, 1983, a Panama-registered ship arrived at 
Zhangjiagang, a port in the lower reach of the Yangtze, as the 
first foreign ship ever entered the river since 1949 when the 
People's Republic was founded. Over the past 11 years, about 
50,000 ships from more than 50 countries and regions in the 
world have docked at the 13 ports along the Chang Jiang River. 
  Foreign ships with displacement of up to 10,000 tons can 
sail 
to the ports from Shanghai to Nanjing in the lower reach of the 
Chang Jiang River, and ones with displacement of up to 5,000 
tons can get to the ports up to Wuhan from Nanjing in the medium 
reach of the river. 
  In the first three months of this year, the ports along the 
lower and middle reaches of the Chang Jiang have served more 
than 3,000 foreign ships. 
  More than 50 ports along the Chang Jiang River in Jiangsu, 
Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces have set business relations 
with more than 50 countries and regions in the world. 
  The ports also opened up more than 30 international 
transport 
routes to foreign countries. 
  The export cargoes at Wuhan port, such as steel and 
fertilizers, can be shipped to more than 20 countries.

   Three-fourths of Bangladesh was under
water Wednesday, and some aid donors say it is time for long-term
solutions in an impoverished land that becomes a vast flood plain
every monsoon season.
   ``We have started thinking about the focus of our development
aid,'' a diplomat from one industrial nation said privately. ``It
doesn't really make sense to pour millions into this country every
year and see it washed away.''
   Floods began in June with the annual monsoon season. They have
claimed 416 lives by the government's count, which is considered
low, and 1,267 on the basis of unofficial tabulations by Dhaka
newspapers.
   The government said Wednesday night all major rivers remained
above flood stage but that water levels fell during the previous 24
hours in all rivers except two small tributaries near the Bay of
Bengal.
   But people still were marooned on rooftops and scarce patches of
high ground, and as many as one-quarter of the nation's 110 million
citizens were homeless.
   Wells and pumps have been submerged and people have begun
drinking flood water, causing a rise in diarrhea cases and fear of
epidemics.
   On Wednesday night, the health service reported 16,813 new cases
of diarrhea in the previous 24 hours, bringing known cases in the
past two weeks to 119,882. Eighty-three of those people have died
and are included in the official death count.
   Statistics come only from areas that can communicate with Dhaka,
however, so the figures probably are low.
   Officials say total damage and reconstration needs cannot be
assessed until the waters recede, but President Hussain Mohammed
Ershad said Tuesday the cost of rebuilding roads and railways alone
would be $156 million.
   Bangladeshi officials, donor nations and international
organizations all say the most pressing need is a regional plan to
stop flood waters that originate outside Bangladesh.
   Water rushes down from the Himalayas each monsoon season in
rivers that empty into the Bay of Bangal through the Bangladesh
delta.
   Ershad and other top Bangladeshi officials emphasize the need to
work with neighboring India and nearby Nepal and Bhutan for a
solution, but a senior U.N. official said he has pushed regional
planning in vain for nearly a decade.
   Until long-term steps are taken, major aid donors say they have
no choice but to help feed the people of Bangladesh, who are among
the world's poorest, and provide medical assistance.
   The United States, for example, is giving Bangladesh $131.5
million in aid this year, including $73 million for food. The rest
is for development assistance, but generally goes for such things
as health, family planning and agricultural research.
   Washington has pledged $3.6 million of flood relief but most
already was in the pipeline as part of the annual aid package.
   American flood relief consists of speeding up delivery of $2.5
million worth of wheat already in Bangladesh for distribution this
year, plus $1.1 million consisting of seed and constributions to
relief funds.
   The International Red Cross appealed for $6 million for the
flood victims. American Red Cross President Richard F. Schubert Jr.
said the funds would be used over the next two months to feed up to
1 million people, clothe up to 100,000 and provide medical relief
and housing for the neediest of families.
   World Vision, an international Christian relief and development
agency based in Monrovia, Calif., appealed for $500,000 for flood
relief aid for Bangladesh.
   Several Bangladeshi officials handling relief said Wednesday
they could not compute the total amount offered from abroad so far.
   A senior U.N. official, whose office helps coordinates foreign
aid, also was unable to provide a total. He said part of the
problem was that much of the aid comes from funds that already had
been allocated for Bangladesh but now is being applied directly to
flood victims.
   ``The figures are changing almost every hour,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``A number of embassies are
exploring what the scope might be and have not yet made a final
commitment.''
   A senior Western diplomat who follows aid donations closely
said, ``People talk about flood control, (but) the major problem
for Bangladesh is overpopulation.''
   Population density in Bangladesh is 2,000 per sqaure mile, the
world's highest after Hong Kong and Singapore.
   While Hong Kong and Singapore are little more than city-states,
however, Bangladesh is an agricultural nation of about 55,000
square miles, roughly the size of Wisconsin.
   Seventy-five percent of its people work in agriculture, working
the rice paddies and jute fields inundated by the floods.

   From the first dry hole to ``Big Bertha,'' the
world's most productive drill bit, the records, trivia and history
that give the ``oil bidness'' its unique, colorful character have
been chronicled by an industry trade journal.
   ``Drilling Magazine,'' updating a list it first ran five years
ago, is giving its 20,000 readers _ primarily well-site operators _
some targets to shoot for and records to brag about.
   ``It's sort of the oil industry's Guinness Book,'' says Editor
Mike Killalea, who compiled the facts appearing in the current
issue of the bi-monthly magazine. ``I'm very much interested in the
curiosity and the oddball. While penetration rates and footage
distances are incredible, they don't grip the imagination.''
   So besides records like the deepest, first and most productive
well, the magazine's list includes such items as how the term
``derrick'' got its name, where the first dry hole was drilled and
the strangest well blowout.
   The U.S. oil industry is generally given a birth year of 1859
with the discovery of crude in Venango County, Pa., on land owned
by the Watson &amp; Brewer Lumber Co. The well generally is known as
the Drake Discovery Well, so named for Edwin Drake, president of
Seneca Oil of New Haven, Conn., the well owner.
   But what's less well-known is the first dry hole, in neighboring
Warren County, Pa. It also carries the distinction of the world's
second oil well, started four days after the Drake Well. More
dubious, it's the first well in which oil tools got stuck.
   Magazine editors also have decided the strangest well blowout
occurred in April 1, 1984, in Texas' Palo Pinto County, when the
Mitchell Lease No. 1 well blew and was shut quickly as a safety
precaution. The next day, however, an explosion two miles away was
blamed on the shut well. Apparently pressure built up and traveled
along a layer of rock and salt 250 feet underground until surfacing
two miles away.
   The term ``derrick,'' by the way, is named after a famous
English hangman who skillfully practiced his trade around 1600. He
was so notorious that his name was applied to anything that was
hoisted or lifted. And in oil, a derrick is the structure that
lifts pipe in and out of the hole.
   New entries to the record book include:
   _The deepest water-depth oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico: a
13,600-foot hole in 3,560 feet of water 55 miles east of the
Mississippi River delta.
   _The deepest water-depth drilling in the world: 7,520 feet, Gulf
of Mexico, Nov. 5, 1987. The hole reached 17,430 feet before the
drillship was moved Feb. 16, 1988.
   _The most productive drill bit: ``Big Bertha,'' a 17{-inch bit
manufactured by Houston-based Hycalog, drilled 18,016 feet in 16
runs in five North Sea wells with no repair between wells. The bit,
used in 1987 and this year, made more holes in the North Sea than
any other single bit. And its mark of going through more than
30,000 cubic feet of rock could make it the most productive single
drill bit of all time.
   U.S. state deep-drilling marks on the books include a well of
20,335 feet in Alaska, set in 1979; 22,712 in California, reached
in 1987; Louisiana's 25,703 feet in 1980; 29,670 feet in Texas in
1982; and 31,441 feet in 1974 in Oklahoma, which used to be the
world's deepest and may be again.
   A 40,000-foot well being drilled in the Soviet Union, cited five
years ago as the world's deepest, since then has caved in,
according to unidentified sources quoted by Drilling Magazine.
   ``Glasnost or no glasnost, it's not the easiest thing to find
out,'' Killalea says. ``I ultimately did discover that the well
caved in a year and a half ago. So they don't have that claim (of
the world's deepest) any more.''
   Killalea says he called the Soviet Embassy in Washington for
confirmation and was told to send a letter.
   ``They were very nice and told me they would get back to me,''
he says. ``I'm waiting to hear from them.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With civilization encroaching on the Amazon rain
forest at the rate of 80,000 square miles a year, AP Special
Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan decided he'd better go see the
world's longest river before it's too late. Here's his journal of a
recent cruise 1,200 miles up the Amazon on a small passenger ship.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MV BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Aaaah-Yeeee-Haaaaa.'' Tarzan cries
upstage the incessant caw of birds, the chatter of monkeys and
peeping of frogs in the vine-tangled rain forest.
   In the morning mist on the Amazon River, dozens of dugout canoes
dart out from a thatched village hugging the muddy bank, where a
scrawny pig and a few frazzled chickens scurry beneath the banana
trees.
   The cries of the canoeists, paddling furiously toward us with
what seemed to be long-handled, gaily painted pingpong paddles,
brought out more boats from houses on stilts farther upstream and
in the side creeks.
   ``They come to greet us but also to keep their boats from being
smashed against those little wooden docks by our bow wave,'' says
Capt. Harry Biehl, looking down from the bridge wing of the
10,000-ton MV Berlin, a small West German passenger ship.
   Most of the 270 passengers desert morning bouillon on the Lido
deck to hug the rails with their cameras and shower down chocolate
bars, fruit from the dining room, soap from their cabins,
cigarettes and ball point pens in plastic bags on the Indian
families, from toothless grandmothers down to the tiniest infants,
bobbing about in the mini-armada that soon slid by in our churning
wake.
   Around the next bend, where a generator throbs and a TV antenna
rises improbably above the flame and rubber trees, the excited
yells of a small boy out on the landing empties out the clapboard
Casa de Sao Jeronimo mission, leaving the preacher waiting at the
altar on a steamy Sunday morning, as his parishoners took to their
boats.
   What next?
   First came the conquistadors, dropouts from Francisco Pizarro's
expedition against the Incas. Then the bandeirantes, the slave
traders, followed by the diamond hunters and the garimpeiros, the
gold prospectors. Next the rubber barons, who were crueler and
greedier than the slavers, then the loggers and ranchers, soon
joined by the industrialists and power dam builders, chewing up the
rain forest with their voracious machines at the rate of 80,000
square miles a year.
   And now tourists.
   The amazing Amazon, the widest, wettest and, so National
Geographic now affirms, the longest river in the world (4,007
miles, 51 longer than the Nile), boasts the longest snake, the most
venomous viper, the biggest rat, beetle and ant, along with
razor-toothed piranhas that can reduce a Brahman steer to raw bones
in minutes and electric eels delivering 640 volts, enough to drive
a Metro-North commuter train. This surging, swarming stream, veined
by 1,000 tributaries, that on its majestic march from the Andes to
the Atlantic carries one-fifth of the fresh water discharged into
the sea by all rivers of the world, now has seen it all.
   Tourists, yet. No wonder the crocodiles stared with jaws agape
from the seclusion of gigantic Victoria Regia lily pads, and the
pumas and jaguars fled into the forest fastness.
   The strange thing is that our mini-liner, small enough to
navigate the Amazon's side channels, avoiding the freighter and
barge traffic in the broad mainstream, was as much a novelty to the
natives unencumbered by cameras as they were to us.
   Smiling and wide-eyed, they swarmed about with blowguns,
javelins, bows and arrows to sell for only a few dollars or barter
for the clothes off your back. Mask makers, a declining skill,
offered replicas of the palm fiber Yagua headdress, framed with
shoulder-length blonde braids, that erroneously gave the Amazon its
name. Gaspar de Caravaj, a Dominican friar who accompanied the
conquistadores in 1541, mistook the local tribesmen in their
shoulder-length headdresses for women warriors. In his journal he
gave the name Amazon to the river, after the lady legionnaires of
Greek legend, writing of ``battling warrior women who fought as 10
Indian men.''
   The tourist incentive is to see it all before it is too late.
   ``The forest is all gone south of here. Who knows what will be
left by the end of the century?'' lamented Serafim Bastedo, a dock
crane operator at Belem, 90 miles from the mouth, the largest city
on the Amazon.
   Now a city of l.2 million, with 24-story high-rise apartments, a
huge manganese plant, open-pit iron mines, modern hospitals and a
six-lane highway to Brasilia 1,000 miles to the south, Belem is a
boom town of jarring contrasts.
   The luxurious Hilton Hotel is flanked by side streets of narrow
Portuguese houses, a door and two windows wide, out of the l7th
century. Its shopping district pulsates to a samba beat broadcast
at top volume from municipal loudspeakers.
   ``Brazilians can't live without noise,'' Serafim shouts over the
din.
   The yacht club shares the riverfront with a rickety fishing
fleet out of another century, jungle medicine stalls selling dried
snakeskins filled with herbs, bones and feathers, and a sprawling
outdoor market with hundreds of tarpaulin-covered restaurants
redolent of roasting cassava and pato no tucupi, duck stewed in a
tangy yellow soup. On the far shore lies Marajo Island, bigger than
Denmark, rangeland for 400,000 Brahman cattle.
   Belem's excellent Goeldi nature preserve keeps alive in a jungle
setting the Amazon's more bizarre residents: the 38-foot-long
anaconda, the deadly bushmaster, the endangered manatee, the
4-foot-long rat called the capybara, exotically plumed and beaked
parrots and toucans, long-tailed squirrel monkeys and lumbering,
leathery tapirs, the Brazilian mammal that looks like the love
child of Dumbo and Miss Piggie.
   A few miles upstream the street lights vanish and the rain
forest resumes.
   Two Brazilian pilots, sharing four-hour shifts, keep watch for
shifting sandbars, sudden current shifts where tributaries enter
and the writhing limbs of partially submerged trees toppled from
the eroding red clay banks as we negotiate the narrow
Breves-Macacos channel.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Why projects stay grounded - The
country's most important economic failing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, visited the bleak sandbanks
of the river Jamuna in central Bangladesh to lay the foundation stone of the
country's biggest-ever investment - a Dollars 700m bridge.
The bridge is sorely needed to link north-west Bangladesh with the rest of
the country. Today, lorries must queue all day to cross the river by a
three-hour ferry ride. Monsoons, floods and droughts disturb the traffic, as
does the constant shifting of the sands in the Jamuna's shallow bed.
Bangladesh is crying out for investment. From the Jamuna bridge to automatic
spindles in the textiles factories and tilling machines on the farms, the
country needs capital to help promote economic growth. Without faster
growth, it cannot hope to meet the needs of its swelling population.
The government and development organisations monitoring Bangladesh, led by
the World Bank, regard the lack of investment as the country's most
important economic failing.
Moreover, at least as far as public investment is concerned, the problem is
not a shortage of funds. It is a lack of experienced and well-motivated
politicians and bureaucrats able to implement the projects on the country's
books.
For private investors political uncertainty, bureaucratic foot-dragging and
the poverty of potential consumers all hold back business activities. Local
investors have been as slow to commit themselves as foreigners. However,
there are signs that a few large private projects now under consideration
could come to fruition and perhaps stimulate the drawing up of other
proposals.
Thanks to the skill of Mrs Zia's government in bringing public borrowing
well under control and curbing inflation to about 2 per cent a year, there
is plenty of scope for the government to expand the public investment
programme. World Bank officials believe that, far from crowding out private
investment, an increased flow of public investment would stimulate private
activity. The Jamuna bridge is a good example - it will permit farmers in
the rural north west to bring more of their crops for sale in central
Bangladesh, including Dhaka, while also giving Dhaka-based manufacturers
better access to distant markets.
Mr Zaifur Rahman, the finance minister, is committed to increasing the ratio
of investment to economic output to an estimated 14.5 per cent in the year
to June 1994 from 13 per cent in 1992-93. The eventual target is 18-20 per
cent.
Foreign aid donors would be ready to increase the amount of aid pledged to
Bangladesh above the Dollars 2.1bn promised for 1994-95, which is roughly
the same as in the past two years. However, with Dollars 5bn in unspent
funds in the pipeline, there is no reason to raise contributions.
One western diplomat involved in aid projects blames 'a weak government, low
quality ministers and civil servants' for the delays in public investment.
Among the serious losses Bangladesh suffered in its 1971 independence war
was the flight to Pakistan of many senior administrators who were of west
Pakistani origin. Nor did the new country's espousal of socialist economic
policies enable civil servants to acquire experience of running open
economies.
Mr Rahman says improved monitoring of schemes will accelerate the investment
flow, but diplomats of donor countries say they see little change as yet.
The controversy surrounding the Dollars 510m Karnaphuli fertiliser plant, a
joint venture between the government, foreign aid donors and Japanese
companies, has also cast a shadow over large-scale investments. First
conceived in 1980 and coming on stream later this year, the plant has been
dogged by arguments about the wisdom of using Bangladesh's scarce gas
resources for fertiliser production instead of fuel. Whatever the merits of
the dispute, its effect has been to call into question the government's
ability to implement mega-projects.
However, the donor countries' decision to back the Jamuna bridge scheme,
which has also been under consideration for over 10 years, shows they are
still willing to take risks in Bangladesh. Similarly, they are supporting a
wide-ranging flood action programme to reduce the impact of future floods
following those which devastated the country in the late 1980s.
By comparison, private sector investments in Bangladesh are mostly small.
Factories for garments, leather and handicrafts, rarely cost over Dollars
100,000. The returns can be spectacular - recent investments in the garments
industry have seen entrepreneurs recover their money in a year.
Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned business
consultant, says: 'Bangladesh generates these small high risk, high return
investments. But what we need is to create a more stable environment to
encourage more long-term local investment and eventually foreign investment
as well.'
A handful of larger investments are in the pipeline. Tootal, the British
subsidiary of Coats Viyella, which operates a spinning mill in Bangladesh,
is building a Dollars 25m extension to increase capacity threefold.
Bangladesh Tobacco, an affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, is considering
a Dollars 60m plan for modernising tobacco and cigarette production.
In the longer term, foreign companies are interested in investing in
telecommunications, transport and energy, if these state-dominated
industries are opened up to private investment as the government plans. In
oil and gas, Holland Sea Search of the Netherlands and Cairns Energy of the
UK are the first of seven international oil exploration groups to have
completed exploration and production agreements. Other potential investors
include Occidental Oil of the US and France's Total.
In electricity, International Energy Group of the US and RP Goenka group, an
Indian business group, have proposed plans for building and operating
privately-owned power stations - but detailed rules for the entry of private
companies have not yet been established. The government hopes to complete a
new energy policy, including rules for private sector participation, next
month.

<HEAD>Millions Take a Dip for Salvation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALLAHABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of barefoot Hindus from across
India jostled and pushed their way to take a dip at the confluence
of two sacred rivers Monday in hopes it would bring them eternal
salvation.
   An estimated 15 million people bathed at river banks in this
central Indian city during the day, many starting as early as 4
a.m., authorities said.
   Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, the creator of the Earth and one
of the ruling trinity of a pantheon of gods and goddesses, awakes at
that hour.
   The bathing is the high point of the seven-week Kumbh Mela
festival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records is
the largest religious gathering on Earth.
   ``The grand show was a grand success,'' said Ravindra Gupta, the
chief administrator of Allahabad. ``It was a difficult day for us
but it's over.''
   His relief came from the fact that the fair _ a logistical
nightmare at the best of times _ had ended without any major
problems.
   Stampedes and armed confrontations between different Hindu sects
have claimed hundreds of lives in previous fairs. In 1954, at least
800 people died in a stampede.
   Police said four people died Monday. Two were drowned when their
boat capsized in midstream and two others died of natural causes,
said Superintendent Vibhuti Narain Rai.
   Authorities make arrangements for the supply of 13,000 gallons of
milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of cheese to the pilgrims every
day. Allahabad city officials have also stockpiled 10,000 tons of
wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons of sugar.
   The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 12 years when a rare planetary
configuration occurs: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and moon in
Capricorn, and a series of complicated calculations of Hindu
astrology.
   Monday is considered the climax of the festival, which started
Jan. 14, because it is also the day of the new moon, another good
omen.
   The festival takes its name of Kumbh Mela from Hindu mythology
when the gods seized a pot of nectar that made them invincible in
their war against the demons.
   A drop of nectar from the gods' pot is thought to have fallen at
Allahabad where the Ganges and Jamuna rivers come together. A bath
at the spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring salvation
from the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   The pilgrims were a diverse lot. Holy men from Himalayan cave
homes and naked recluses from forest dens came to the river banks in
chariots and on camels draped with brightly embroidered cloths.
   Most trekked to the bathing spots but some came on horseback and
the more affluent in Mercedes salons.
   The bathing at the Kumbh Mela began with processions of holy men,
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance
of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna
and the mythical Swaraswati. The Swaraswati cannot be seen, but
Hindus believe it flows beneath the Earth's surface where the two
other rivers meet.
   The rivers turned muddy brown and foul smelling as more bathers
immersed themselves. Many used empty liquor bottles and pots to
carry the holy water home.
   ``Either these people are crazy or there must be something we
can't see or understand,'' said Nina Marshall, 23, of Berkeley,
Calif.
   ``It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims
walking to the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. She was
among dozens of Americans who had come to see the unique religious
spectacle.
   For the faithful, the bathing is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
   ``I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,''
said Sarju Mahato, a farmer from Bihar state, as he tended the
blisters on his two sons' feet. ``We saved money and came here.''
   Ganesh Dasgupta, a railroad worker from Calcutta, brought his
family of six and said with satisfaction: ``I have got what I
wanted. A bath here is equal to visiting all the pilgrim centers in
the country.''

Long gone are the days when hotels reserved entire floors for out-of-town 
fishermen tempted by the thousands of steelhead that could be seen splashing in 
the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has passed the time when a tourist guide could gush, as one did in 
1911, that "a fine stream flows into the ocean at the west end of the city, and 
from May to October the breakfast tables of Ventura need never go troutless." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, dams, diversions, mining and pollution have battered the 
once-bountiful river, from its convergence with Matilija Creek 16 miles north 
to the brackish lagoon at its mouth near the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Left in between are countless stretches of parched stone, bulldozer-scarred 
banks and no more than 100 of the legendary seagoing steelhead trout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Interest 
</P>
<P>
Yet a growing interest in the river is beginning to stem that tide of decay. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of an ambitious four-year study of the lower river and tidal 
estuary being conducted by UC Santa Barbara is expected to be completed this 
summer. Researchers hope that the report, which is the first attempt to analyze 
plants, soil and water quality in the area, will eventually persuade state 
officials to preserve the river's mouth as a wildlife refuge.

In addition, environmental groups are rallying to challenge a sand and gravel 
company's application to continue mining from 50,000 to 250,000 tons annually 
from the river bed about 1 1/2 miles upstream. Recently those groups expressed 
their concerns in a meeting with Ventura County planning officials, who will 
require Southern Pacific Milling Co. to undergo an environmental review later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the river were also buoyed last summer when the California Supreme 
Court rejected a proposed agreement between Ventura and the Casitas Municipal 
Water District to divert part of the stream as reserve for use in a drought. 
The court ruled that, even though officials had vowed to limit any ecological 
damage, the loss of water would probably decimate the few remaining trout. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Not 'Stagnant Pool' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing is to pass on to the public that this isn't 
just a stagnant puddle of water with no value," said Wayne R. Ferren Jr., 
curator of the UCSB Herbarium and coordinator of the university's study. "A lot 
of people don't realize that they have a gem in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for people accustomed to seeing rushing water in their rivers, the 
Ventura might seem more like a lump of coal. Low stream flow, exacerbated by 
three years of drought, makes walking long stretches of the river bed in tennis 
shoes a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The natural beauty is not enhanced by the industrial plants and oil fields that 
line its banks where the river parallels Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
High above, in the Ojai Valley, the Matilija Dam, a 152-foot-high concrete 
monolith built in 1948, holds back the flow that once made the stream the 
world's second-most-prolific trout habitat, behind the Santa Ynez River in 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remarkable Resiliency 
</P>
<P>
But for all that, the Ventura River has shown remarkable resiliency. Fed by 
four mountain creeks, it has still managed to sustain abundant plant and animal 
life. Idyllic nooks dot the stream's length. And its lower stretches are among 
only 25% of the state's coastal wetlands that have managed so far to survive 
20th-Century development. 
</P>
<P>
In the 200-acre area being studied by UCSB, more than 30 different types of 
vegetation have been identified, including salt marshes, black cottonwood 
forests, intertidal cobble zones and riparian scrub. At least 230 plant species 
have been noted, including the California walnut, pickle weed, salt grass and 
bulrush. About 200 bird species have been spotted, including snowy egrets, 
Virginia rails, merlins and ruddy turnstones. 
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers bathe the dunes near the ocean in splashes of lavender and yellow. 
Flocks of red-winged blackbirds stir up a ruckus in the tall reeds. Flowering 
green duckweed floats on the surface of small tidal pools near the river's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"If your measure of health is a river loaded with 10-pound fish, then obviously 
this river is not very healthy," said Mark Capelli, executive director of the 
1,700-member Friends of the Ventura River. "But there are a lot of other 
resources -- maybe a bit more subtle -- that show the river is still enormously 
vigorous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1990 Survey 
</P>
<P>
UCSB researchers intend to make those resources more overt. In June, they will 
deliver a report that state officials paid $4,000 for, cataloguing plant life 
in the surrounding Emma Wood State Beach wetlands. With other grants, they will 
publish a final survey in 1990 recommending various methods of restoring and 
maintaining the ecologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
The project, they hope, will lead to greater appreciation of the lower river 
and its estuary, as well as to the creation of nature trails, guide books and 
informational maps. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just nothing indicating to the public the value of the site," Ferren 
said. "And the more enlightened the public is about our resources, the more 
protection we'll have for them." 
</P>
<P>
The river, which for thousands of years had sustained the Chumash Indians, 
suffered a blow when oil was discovered at the west end of the city in 1916. 
For years, during the first heavy rain of the season, the oil companies used 
the waters to rinse their holding ponds of drilling-mud and brine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, through World War II, the Ventura River supported a substantial 
steelhead population, estimated to have been as high as 4,000 or 5,000 fish. A 
1911 newspaper story reported a hefty trout caught by one George Pacheco that 
measured 3 feet and weighed 14 pounds. Fishermen, who competed in annual 
contests sponsored by sporting goods stores, lined up by the hundreds for the 
season's opening day. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the Matilija Dam was built 40 years ago to reduce flood hazards 
and provide additional water for neighboring communities that the trout stock 
began to dwindle. The Casitas Dam, built in 1959 about 6 1/2 miles from the 
river's mouth, sounded the death knell. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more environmental hazards have been faced, including the Oak View 
Sanitation District's sewage facility, which discharges treated effluent about 
4 1/2 miles above the river's mouth; a now-defunct Shell Oil Co. chemical 
plant, which was found guilty of dumping ammonia in the river in 1972; and 
Southern Pacific Milling Co., which began its mining operation in the river bed 
and surrounding flood plain in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura River represents, one way or another, just about everything man 
can do to degrade a natural environment," said Charlie Price, president of 
Friends of the Ventura River and a former county fish and game commissioner. 
"It's been a steady, long-term deterioration."

<HEAD>Death Toll at 103 In Train Crash</HEAD>

   Divers working under 30 feet of water
used blowtorches Saturday to cut open a railway car and found 13
more victims of a train wreck in southern India, bringing the death
toll to 103, officials said.
   The massive rescue operation stretched into Saturday night as
divers searched for more bodies beneath the sunken coaches in Lake
Asthamudi in Kerala state.
   At least 103 bodies were recovered, and 167 people were
hospitalized, said Abdul Latif, a senior official in Quilon, a town
near the accident site. At least 1,000 police and navy personnel
were involved in the search.
   Nine cars of the crowded 14-car Island Express tumbled toward
the lake Friday after the train derailed crossing a bridge. Six
coaches were partly or fully submerged, and three hung into the
water from the bridge 15 feet above.
   It wasn't known how many people were on the train, which crashed
at about 1:15 p.m. At least 500 people were treated for injuries.
The train had a capacity of 1,700 people, but survivors said it was
extremely crowded.
   Vice Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas, chief of the Southern Naval
Command, told The Associated Press by telephone, ``It's a ghastly
disaster. Today, the relatives have managed to accept their
miserable fate, but yesterday it was terrible.''
   ``The scenes in hospitals are reminiscent of casualties from a
battlefield .... Bruises, wounds, cuts all over,'' he said.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia ordered a formal inquiry
into the accident. He announced that victims' families would be
given 100,000 rupees, or $7,142, in compensation.
   During a news conference in Quilon, he refused to comment on the
cause of the accident.
   Latif, a magistrate in Quilon district, said train engineer T.
Paul reported that the train developed mechanical trouble. Paul was
not hurt.
   Latif, reached by telephone, quoted Paul as saying that the
fast-moving train suddenly braked before the derailment.
   ``At this stage, we cannot be sure if it was human error or
mechanical failure,'' Latif said.
   Several survivors told Indian news agencies that they believed
the crew applied the brakes just before the train derailed.
   Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a
cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment.
   Matthew John, a railway safety official, said two spans of the
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as
the train cars plunged into the water.
   Most of the victims died from drowning, Latif said.
   The line of grieving relatives outside hospitals in Quilon
stretched for a mile, news agency reports said.
   The crash was Kerala's worst train accident, but both witnesses
and officials said fatalities could have been worse without quick
rescue work by fishermen and farmers.
   Paddling dozens of long, narrow fishing boats, they rushed to
the wreckage and pulled out more than 200 passengers before rescue
workers could make it though the jungle to the lake.
   The Indian railway system is the second largest in the world,
carrying more than 9 million passengers daily.But train accidents
are common and claim hundreds of lives annually. Last year, 227
people died in 613 train accidents in India.
   The world's worst train accident occurred in India, according to
the Guinness Book of Records. More than 800 people were killed when
a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the eastern state of
Bihar in June 1981, Guinness said.

   Women wailed alongside Dhaleswari
River that swirled over a sunken ship Wednesday, and Afazuddin Ahmed
fell to his knees on the sandy bank, sharing his grief with
thousands.
   Ahmed had rushed to this little river town when he heard that a
ferry with an estimated 250 people aboard _ including his family _
had sunk just off shore Tuesday.
   Survivors and witnesses said no more than 100 passengers survived
the tragedy. Only five bodies have been found, but authorities
believe many more are inside the vessel's submerged hull.
   Ahmed found his 4-year-old daughter wandering among the
grief-stricken crowd of survivors and relatives, but his 22-year-old
wife and three other young daughters were missing.
   The family was headed to visit his father-in-law, and Ahmed, who
had stayed behind to farm, would have joined them Thursday.
   ``Oh, Allah, what have I done to you that I should be punished
this way?'' the 30-year-old farmer cried, joining a cacophony of
sorrow and confusion. ``I must die, why should I live? What should I
live for?''
   An estimated 5,000 people, most of them relatives, crowded this
little village on the western bank of the river Wednesday while
searchers looked for survivors from Tuesday's sinking.
   The ferry, a single-deck motor launch called the Shasayal, sank
after colliding with a cargo vessel.
   The 74-feet wooden ship was under 21 feet of water as rescuers
awaited the arrival of a salvage ship from the southern port town of
Mongla. The ship is not expected before Thursday.
   Witnesses and passengers said the ferry had a sanctioned capacity
of only 168 people.
   ``Only those traveling on the upper deck of the ferry could
survive,'' said Mohammad Ali, a Dhaka businessman who swam ashore.
   ``It is unlikely that there is anyone alive inside the hull. More
bodies are likely to be found inside the hull,'' said Chowdhury
Mohammad Azad, director of Bangladesh's shipping department.
   Police and other government officials would not comment on the
death toll or the number missing. A police officer speaking on
condition of anonymity would only say five bodies were found.
   Ferries are a popular form of transportation in Bangladesh and
accidents are relatively common, but death tolls are difficult to
estimate. Government officials often refuse to confirm witness
accounts of dead or missing.
   Some villagers hurled stones at police and rescue officials,
accusing them of slowing the rescue operation to cover up the number
of casualties. The police quieted the crowd with mild baton charges.
   Abul Kalam was traveling to Dhaka from the village of Hasail,
where the ferry's journey started. He said his four children were
lost in the sinking.
   The family was returning to their Dhaka home after a week-long
visit to Kalam's father-in-law's house at Hasail, only seven miles
south of Dhaka.
   ``I am afraid I shall never get my children back. What shall I
tell to their mother?'' he said, bursting into tears.

   From the imprint of a kiss to ``Chill Out _
Stop the Violence,'' Americans are adding personal messages of
good-will to a 35-foot-tall greeting card for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Topped by intertwined American and Soviet flags, the card is
addressed to the Soviet leader and his people, and says in Russian:
``We the people of the United States of America wish to express our
gratitude for your contribution toward world peace. Happy New Year!''
   Displayed Tuesday at a shopping mall, the card was attached to a
roll of paper for Americans to sign and add personal notes.
   Craig Goodell, Fairfield, Iowa, an associate of Jim Lawlor, who
conceived the project, said he expects 50 of the 100-foot scrolls to
be sent to the Soviet Union along with the giant card.
   When Gorbachev gets the card he will see the hot-pink lipstick
impression left by Maggie Wright.
   With ``America'' written above her top lip, ``Russia'' below the
bottom lip and a heart around the whole greeting, the 22-year-old
Salt Lake City woman's message of peace and love was clear.
   ``That's what I'd do if I met him _ kiss him or hug him,'' Ms.
Wright said. ``I'm into what's going on there and here, and I want
to see them keep doing it. Anything will help.''

   To sculptor Frederick Nicholas Trenchard, the pile
of Dole banana boxes was ``Moving the Mountain,'' a
``full-dimensional quadrature'' that proves ``scarcity does not
exist.''
   To the folks running the Arts Festival of Atlanta, it was trash.
   So even though they paid Trenchard $3,000 for his work, festival
officials had it hauled away Tuesday in a city garbage truck.
   Actually, the truck hauled away what was left of the
``quadrature.'' Festival-goers had already kicked some of the boxes
all over the Piedmont Park hill where they sat.
   It was the first time in the festival's 36-year history that a
commissioned site sculpture was removed.
   ``We encourage risk-taking, and sometimes a sculpture will
fail,'' said Pat Gann, the festival's executive director. ``This is
worse.''
   Ms. Gann said the New Orleans artist had proposed an 11,000-pound
mound of rice, which was to be used to feed the hungry after the
festival ends Sunday. Instead, he erected a stack of cardboard boxes
filled with grass clippings and a few dozen bags of rice.
   ``It's their festival,'' the artist said. ``I'm not going to
argue with them.''

   Grocer Robert Brackle has gone to great
lengths to publicize this weekend's Germanfest celebration.
   He commissioned what he claims is the state's longest hot dog.
   Brackle won't disclose the exact length of the link _ that's the
subject of a guessing contest among his customers.
   All he'll say is it's longer than the 450-foot frank he ordered
as a publicity stunt in 1984.
   The whopping weiner will be measured Sept. 29, and whoever
guessed closest to the right length will get a $50 gift certificate.
Then the frank will be cut into normal lengths and sold.
   The sausage is a long way from making the record books. The
Guinness Book of World Records says the top dog is a 9.87-mile long
sausage produced in London in 1987.
