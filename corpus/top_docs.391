   PPG Industries Inc. said it agreed to buy Clorox Co.'s two paint subsidiaries for $130 million, doubling its consumer paint business. 

   The units are Olympic HomeCare Products and Lucite HomeCare Products, which have combined annual paint and stain sales of about $100 million. 

   The transaction is subject to government approval and other conditions. 

   The planned purchase gives PPG, a maker of glass, chemicals and coatings, broader distribution for its consumer paints, which analysts say have lagged its industrial and automotive coatings. 

   PPG's Pittsburgh Paints brand is distributed through independent dealers, while the Olympic and Lucite products will open up the home-center market for PPG. That's important because of stiff retail competition among paint makers, according to analysts. 

   For Clorox, an Oakland, Calif., household-products concern, the sale price is a discount, considering the two brands were purchased for about $173 million in separate transactions in 1981 and 1983. 
However, the acquisitions did include other units, such as a plastic molding business, which have been sold previously. 

   But analysts consider Clorox's performance in the paint business mediocre. 
"The two businesses were almost destined to fail," says James Wilbur, analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
One reason, he suggests, was Clorox's marketing approach that put too much emphasis on advertising brand names. 

   Mr. Wilbur says that consumers tend to buy whatever paint is offered in a local store rather than shop until they find a certain brand. 
"You can't use mass advertising to drag people in," he adds. 

   Clorox officials say they decided to get out of the paint business so they could focus on the company's household and grocery-products operations. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Clorox closed at $41.625, up $1, while PPG slipped 37.5 cents to $44.375.

   PPG Industries Inc. said Thursday it purchased
the Olympic HomeCare Products and Lucite HomeCare Products
subsidiaries from Clorox Co. for $130 million.
   PPG said the acquisition includes headquarters offices in
Bellvue, Wash., and plants in Ballard, Wash.; Batavia, Ill.;
Louisville, Ky.; and Langley, British Columbia. It said the units
have about 350 workers.
   PPG said combined annual sales of the paint and stains
subsidiaries of oakland, calif.-based Clorox exceed $100 million.
   Eugene B. Mosier, PPG group vice president for coatings and
resins, said the addition of the Olympic and Lucite product lines
``will contribute to the profitable growth of our architectural
coatings business.''
   PPG markets paints under the Pittsburgh Paints name in North
America and the PPG Corona brand name in Europe.
   Clorox Chairman Charles R. Weaver said in June his cmpany had
decided to sell the paints and stains businesses ``to focus
resources on its core business as a diversified manufacturer and
marketer of household grocery products.''

Clorox Puts Unit Up for Sale: Clorox Co. put its $106.8-million Olympic stain 
and Lucite paint business on the block, conceding that the subsidiary failed to 
live up to expectations. Clorox said it would solicit offers for its Olympic 
HomeCare Products subsidiary, which manufacturers and markets Olympic wood 
stains and Lucite interior and exterior house paint. Clorox bought Olympic in 
1981 for $123 million and added the Lucite brand in 1983 for $50 million. The 
products, although profitable, have performed poorly compared to the rest of 
Clorox's product line. This year, analysts expect the subsidiary's sales to 
drop to $100 million or less. One analyst said the division had only a 50% shot 
of turning a profit.

   Clorox Co. expects to report net income for the quarter and year ended June 30 fell from a year-earlier, reflecting a write-down from the anticipated sale of its Olympic paints division. 

   The household-product concern's net for the year-ago quarter totaled $36.5 million, or 67 cents a share. 
Fourth-quarter sales rose about 15% from $360.8 million a year earlier. 

   Net for the previous year was $130.9 million, or $2.39 a share. 
Sales grew 18% from $1.15 billion the previous year. 

   Results for the prior periods were restated to reflect exclusion of the Olympic division's results as well as the exercise of a note by Henkel KGaA, a West German household-product and chemical company owning about 27.3% of Clorox's 55.4 million common shares outstanding. 

   William F. Ausfahl, group vice president and chief financial officer, said that in fiscal 1989, Clorox shipped record volumes of several established product lines, including liquid bleach, cat litter and barbecue sauce. 
Improved performance also reflects the absence of some charges against equipment and foreign investments taken in last year's fourth quarter. 

   "So our continuing businesses are very healthy," he said. 
However, the company lavished its highest-ever level of spending on several new product introductions -- including its Clorox Detergent, still in test-markets in the West, Southwest and Southeast. 
The detergent has prompted a round of competitive products and promotions by giant Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and others. 
Thus, the anticipated date of the detergent's national introduction is still a closely guarded secret "for competitive reasons," Mr. Ausfahl added. 

   The planned sale of the Olympic paints division, a strategic move to concentrate on core household and food-service businesses is pending. 
The sale for an as-yet undetermined price will result in a write-down of unknown size, Mr. Ausfahl said. 

   This anticipated write-down -- which he declined to discuss -- depressed net to below last year's periods, "but we will still be profitable," he added. 

   Analysts have estimated that the paint division could fetch anywhere from $70 million to $120 million, but Clorox won't comment on such speculation. 
The company said it is still reviewing bids from several potential buyers.

   Clorox Co., Oakland, Calif., posted a $21.9 million loss from its discontinued paint unit, forcing a nearly 50% plunge in its fourth-quarter net income to $18.8 million, or 34 cents a share, from $36.6 million, or 67 cents a share, a year ago. 

   The household products company posted an 11% increase in operating profit to $40.8 million, or 74 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30. 
The write-downs stem from the planned sale of its Olympic stain and Lucite paint business. 

   For the year, Clorox posted a 10% gain in operating profit to $145.6 million, or $2.63 a share, from $130.9 million, or $2.39 a share, in fiscal 1988. 
A $21.4 million loss from the discontinued operations made net $124.1 million, or $2.24 a share. 

   For the previous year, a $1.6 million gain from discontinued operations made net $132.6 million, or $2.42 a share. 

   Results for the year-ago periods were restated to reflect both the discontinued paint operations, as well as the conversion of a note payable to Henkel Corp.

   Clorox Co., Oakland, Calif., said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as five million shares, or 9%, of its common outstanding. 

   The maker of bleach and other consumer products said the shares will be repurchased through periodic open-market and block transactions. 
Clorox had 55.4 million shares outstanding as of June 30. 

   C.R. Weaver, chairman and chief executive officer, said Clorox expects to have higher cash reserves after its planned sale of its Olympia HomeCare Products Co. unit and that "the repurchase of shares is an appropriate use" of some of those funds. 
He said the repurchased shares will be held in the company's treasury for future corporate purposes such as stock options, among other possibilities. 

   A spokesman said Clorox is negotiating with a potential buyer for the Olympia unit, which primarily makes paint and wood stains. 
He said Clorox believes it is "very close to a deal."

<TEXT>
ALIAS OLYMPIA by Eunice Lipton Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 12.95, 181 pages
FOR EVERY one art lover who knows her name, thousands can instantly
recognise the face and body of Victorine Meurent. She was the bold model
with the tight little frame and steady, daring gaze whose depiction in
Manet's Olympia and Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe revolutionised European nude
painting and outraged the 19th century art world. Contemporaries called
Meurent 'a female gorilla' and marched through the Salon with sticks and
umbrellas to attack her portrait. Now she is something of a feminist
heroine, the plucky naked girl who stares out of the canvas defying male
expectations of submission, the star of a sexy fete champetre who refuses
her part in the erotic script.
Who was the woman behind the image? Alias Olympia is subtitled 'a woman's
search for Manet's notorious model and her own desire', and began as Eunice
Lipton's attempt to find out. Lipton is a distinguished art historian, but
she soon discovered that history had buried Meurent as a typical model -
prostitute, alcoholic, loser - nicknamed 'the Shrimp'. Meurent is known to
have painted as well as modelled, but records, documents and interest in her
were negligible. There seemed no book to be written.
But Meurent became for Lipton an obsession, and scholarly research a
detective trail of blazing personal urgency. With wit and perception, Lipton
describes how she lived, breathed and dreamt Meurent, how lacklustre
archivists and Parisian alleys drove her to paranoia, how she came to see
the Parisian model born a hundred years before her as an alter ego who
shared her own problems with family, lovers, feminism and the art
establishment. Biography merges into autobiography, art history into a novel
as she creates her own idealised Meurent: a defiant lesbian artist who
whizzes about Paris, sells her paintings, drinks alone in bars, does her own
thing.
The result is a clever, unorthodox, enthralling book which combines
criticism and fiction in elegant symbiosis. Lipton's overarching theme is
the century-old treatment of women as objects in art and culture, and the
way this continues to condition how women see themselves. Here Meurent is
the breakthrough, 'resisting centuries of admonition to ingratiate herself',
consigned to (patriarchal) historical oblivion as punishment. Manet, who
after all created the radical image, gets no credit.
But you do not have to agree with Lipton to enjoy her story. Her format
allows a plethora of juicy digressions - sharp words on the pampered,
male-bonded lives of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, for example, snap into
an analysis of why Renoir and Manet and Monet endlessly depicted one other
painting, but never drew the women artists working. Lipton has inspired
hunches, admissions of uncertain assumptions or dead-end routes which a
narrower scholarly work would lose. Most dazzling is her confidence to turn
the tables on herself and unearth research that shows how pathetically an
ageing, down-and-out Meurent traded on the Manet connection: a final joke in
which Meurent refuses to play her author's game as trenchantly as she
declined to satisfy the 19th century viewer.
Alias Olympia joins a small, impressive genre of post-modern criticism -
Richard Holmes' Footsteps, Cecily Mackworth's offbeat account of Freud in
Lucy's Nose last year - where the academic search is the story, where loose
ends are not tied up and uncertainties are accepted and bring life to the
narrative. It is cultural history at once learned, provocative, original and
unstuffy.

<HEAD>Rock Star's Art Auction Tops $7 Million</HEAD>

   A sale of rock star Elton John's diverse
collection of art objects, furniture, stage clothes and memorabilia
topped $7 million at a Sotheby's auction Thursday.
   John's stuffed toys, fantasy objects and designer clothing
fetched $144,000 and his art collection sold for $1.3 million.
   The running total in the four-day sale reached $7.6 million, the
auction house said.
   Among items sold Thursday night was a replica of the state
throne of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, its wood frame covered in
gold leaf and enameled on the backrest with Egyptian hieroglyphics,
which fetched $15,800.
   More of John's furniture, ceramics, sculpture and miscellaneous
items, including amusement machines and walking sticks, were to be
auctioned Friday, the final sale day.
   The entertainer's stage costumes, memorabilia, furniture,
ornaments and jewelry were sold Tuesday and Wednesday.
   John, 41, has said he wants to make room in his mansion near
Windsor, west of London, to start new collections.
   Prices for about 300 lots of art, from Rembrandt etchings to art
nouveau posters and fashion designs, mostly went well above the
presale estimates, Sotheby's auction house said.
   The top price was $119,000 for a painting of a fish wearing a
rope of pearls by the Belgian surrealist, Rene Magritte. It was
bought by an anonymous customer from Brussels.
   Two pictures by northern England artist L. S. Lowry, who mostly
painted industrial scenes, sold for a total of nearly $150,000, or
$64,200 above estimate.
   A modern sculpture of a kneeling woman supporting a glass-top
table, by British artist Allen Jones, made $35,300.
   A 1934 costume design for a Paris theater by Erte, pseudonym of
Romain de Tirtoff, sold to a private collector for $27,000, a
record for the artist's work.
   Fantasy paintings by the living German artist Paul Wunderlich
also did well, one called ``Olympia with Leaf,'' based on Edouard
Manet's famous nude courtesan, ``Olympia,'' sold for $26,000.

   The Olympic Games don't open until next month, but
illustrator Bart Forbes has already won some artistic gold medals.
   The U.S. Postal Service chose designs submitted by Forbes for
both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympic commemoratives. The summer
stamp, which depicts a male gymnast, was issued Friday at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   In addition, Forbes, whose realistic depictions have graced the
covers of Time, Sports Illustrated and dozens of other magazines,
has been chosen by the Korean Olympic Committee as the official
artist of the summer games.
   Forbes, 49, was commissioned to finish 12 paintings before he
leaves for Seoul next month. He will paint about 20 more for a
museum that will commemorate the games.
   A golfer and sometime-tennis player, Forbes says he's not an
athlete, but his studio in a renovated century-old two-story
building in Dallas' arts district is trimmed with old baseballs,
hats and other sports paraphernalia.
   ``Sports is a subject matter I like to do,'' Forbes said,
calling the Olympics assignment a career highlight. ``It's fun.
It's exciting and timely.''
   Timely but not dated. Forbes believes well done art is timeless.
   ``I don't want to get caught doing finish-line illustrations,''
Forbes said of the typical sporting event depiction.
   ``The crux for any painter or illustrator is not being satisfied
with the first or most obvious solution,'' he said. The challenge,
he continued, is to portray the human spirit of the games, how
athletes respond to enormous pressure, for instance.
   ``Many of the athletes train four years for just one shot. It's
an incredible event. Sure, there are some who are just glad they
made it to the Olympics, but for so many they're there for only one
thing: a gold medal.''
   An art graduate of the University of North Carolina, Forbes
earned an advanced degree at the Art Center in Los Angeles. Unsure
of his ability to break into the New York design industry, Forbes
settled in Dallas for several years after school.
   Later, after spending five years in New York, Forbes returned
with his family to Dallas. He said he's lucky to be able to live
where he wants and work on a ``national scale.''
   Forbes paints with a simple realism he says is influenced by the
American artists Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer, among others.
   The KOC commission was something of a coincidence.
   When the United States Sports Academy in Mobile, Ala., honored
Forbes as its sports artist of the year in 1987, he shared the
graduate school's spotlight with Korean Olympic Committee president
Chong Ha Kim.
   A few weeks after that meeting, Kim told Forbes he'd been chosen
the committee's official artist and invited him to Seoul for a week
to make preparations.
   Forbes' first 12 paintings, based on that visit, will be part of
a calendar the KOC will sell during the Olympics, which begin
September 17.
   In all, Forbes will create an original work depicting each
Olympic event as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.

   PPG Paints a Bleaker Picture of the Future,
   Having Just Patted Itself on the Back for '90

   PITTSBURGH -- Plenty of companies claim to have found
strategies to bullet-proof themselves against recession,
among them PPG Industries, whose stock has soared 46% from
its October low.
   Not only did the maker of glass, chemicals and coatings
post record results for 1990 but Chairman Vincent A. Sarni
found occasion to take a bow in the just-issued annual
report, declaring that the company's "strategy was tested and
it proved to be sound."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, not quite that sound.
   PPG startled Wall Street with last week's disclosure that
it expects first-quarter profit to drop as much as 50%,
reflecting weak demand from its core automobile and
construction markets. So much for the company's recession
resistance.
   Although Mr. Sarni warned shareholders in the annual
report that 1991 might be a tough year, the stock tumbled
more than 2 points after the midweek announcement, before
recovering Friday to 50 1/4, up 1.
   Now, PPG is suddenly back to looking like a plain old
manufacturer that isn't invulnerable to the business cycle.
And on that basis, analysts say, the stock looks like a weak
performer going forward. It all goes to show that even if
"cyclical" stocks do outperform the market, as some people
expect, it's unwise for investors to blindly snap up the
shares of any company in a basic industry.
   Some analysts say the bad news for PPG may not be over
even if the ecomony recovers. Although increased car sales
and housing starts would certainly help, those industries
have been heading down for five years. Worse, there's an
overcapacity in glass and in some of PPG's chemicals.
   As a result, some analysts believe the company may not
benefit, as it usually has, as an "early-cycle stock," or a
stock that prospers when the economy is coming out of a
cyclical downturn. Some PPG analysts also say the company
needs new products to drive earnings; it made an effort with
a foray into medical electronics systems, but that has been a
bust.
   "At the end of the day," says James Wilbur, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., "the biggest challenge is
how can the company continue to grow when its core products
-- glass and paint -- are in slow-growth markets?"
   It's not that PPG hasn't been trying. In recent years, the
company has made considerble headway in diminishing its
dependence on longtime core businesses.
   The company has pushed aggressively overseas, with Europe
now accounting for 43% of earnings, up from zero in 1984. PPG
has expanded its replacement-glass and coatings business to
ease its dependence on new-car sales. It wrung out costs,
beefed up the specialty chemicals line, introduced
high-technology coatings and bought Olympic and Lucite
paints.
   The strategy seemed to be working as the company generated
1990 earnings of $475 million, or $4.43 a share, on sales of
more than $6 billion. Investors applauded, and in the 12
months through Feb. 28 the stock price jumped 33%, far
outstripping a 10% gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index.
   But PPG is still at the mercy of its longtime markets, as
the first quarter of this year illustrates. General Motors
remains its largest customer.
   "The notion that the company was less cyclical now hasn't
held true," says Charles LoCastro, an analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who acknowledges that he was taken aback
by the profit announcement. "I thought their earnings would
hold up much better."
   Mr. LoCastro has downgraded his position on the stock to
neutral from moderately attractive. He also has slashed his
earnings estimate for 1991 to $3.50 a share from $4.25.
   A weak business climate isn't the only factor in PPG's
quarterly profit drop. In a terse statement projecting the
earnings decline, PPG said that its first-quarter net will
include a one-time gain relating to a change in accounting.
The company further stated that the impact of this gain will
be reduced "by charges for the realignment of various
operations."
   The company won't elaborate and declined to comment for
this column. PPG, however, has indicated to analysts that the
write-off will essentially negate the accounting gain.
   One lesson that PPG has learned is that overseas markets
don't help, because those markets can slump, too. New-car
sales are showing double-digit declines in three of PPG's
largest European markets, Italy, France and Britain. And in
the U.S., no amount of diversification can compensate for a
12.8% falloff in January housing starts.
   Some people apparently saw PPG heading for trouble. Steve
Pesek, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Management &amp; Research
Co., says the firm sold 3.5 million shares of PPG common last
summer. "Their primary markets are still cyclical," he says.
"They can't repeal the economic cycle."

FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: A deliciously scandalous painter - Fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVER a painter had the luck of the gods, it was Henri Gervex. Son of a
Montmartre piano-maker, Gervex floated up through French society with the
effortlessness of Montgolfier's balloon. At his death in 1929 Gervex was
wealthy and fabulously well-connected. His daughter had married into the
aristocracy, and his paintings graced some of the grandest dining-rooms in
Europe.
Now, in a modest way, the Gervex balloon is once more on the way up, thanks
to an exhibition which has just opened in Bordeaux. (Next year, it travels
to Paris and Nice.) There has never been a retrospective of the great
arriviste, so tracking his canvasses to the homes of private collectors has
meant a good deal of sleuthing for the show's organisers. Not, however, that
Gervex is a totally unknown painter - above all, not in Bordeaux.
For half a century, 'Rolla', the large, frothy scene of the morning-after in
a cheap hotel, has been the most popular painting in the museum's collection
 -and star of the postcard sales, far surpassing Titian, Veronese and even
Delacroix's 'Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi'. There was a nasty moment
when it seemed that the newly created Musee d'Orsay might reclaim the
State's deposit, as it had every right to do. But Paris, mindful for once of
local sensibilities, stayed its hand.
Gervex was 26 in 1878 when he exhibited 'Rolla', unquestionably his
masterpiece, in the Salon. Already, he was well and truly launched after
winning a medal for the horribly squirming, but academically impeccable,
'Satyr playing with a Bacchante', which showed him to be every inch the
faithful pupil of the great Cabanel. But with 'Rolla', Gervex showed himself
to be now a true believer in Manet's gospel that artists must paint modern
life.
His nude, however, is no 'Olympia', the painting which over a decade before
had caused such a scandal. There was no risk of Gervex ever reneging on the
academic doctrine of ideal beauty of form in the matter of nudes. Throughout
his life, as we see in the upstairs rooms of the exhibition, paintings of
meltingly boneless nudes - usually redheads - were one of his stand-bys. In
old age, Gervex the dinosaur even reverted to Cabanalesque goddesses lolling
on the tops of waves.
It was with 'Rolla', however, that Gervex showed his uncanny gift for public
relations. It was banned as immoral, for reasons well explained by Hollis
Clayson in her interesting study of prostitution in French 19th-century
painting, 'Painted Vice' (Yale University Press). A prostitute in her
corset, like Manet's 'Nana', was tolerable; discarded corsets and
petticoats, with Monsieur Rolla's walking stick pointing at a provocative
angle, were quite another.
Undaunted, Gervex put it on exhibition in the Chaussee d'Antin; le tout
Paris was invited to see, and for weeks the street was filled with
carriages. Gervex was now a deliciously scandalous painter, in addition to
being a perfectly delightful human being. In the 1880s and '90s, Gervex was
irrepressible. The older generation of Impressionists loved him for his
raffishness.
Early success meant he could afford a famous mistress, Madame Valtesse de la
Bigne, whom we see in a large and glibly sub-Manet open-air portrait. He
thoughtfully introduced her to Zola, researching the background for his
immortal prostitute, Nana. Another little scandal, when he exhibited a
painting of a nude wearing a velvet mask, helped his reputation. Everyone
wanted to know whose wife she was, and a count sueing his sister for her
inheritance said she had been the sitter . . .
Gervex's industry was prodigious and he would never turn down a prestigious
commission, no matter how boring the subject. A brilliant stroke in 1889 was
to join up with the Belgian artist, Alfred Stevens, and paint a gigantic
'Panorama of the History of the Century', shown here in a modest copy from
Brussels.
Gervex had now shown himself as the republican patriot, honouring the
Revolution. People flocked to see it, and when a buyer did not come forward,
small pieces were given to each of the financial backers.
Clearly, here was the right artist to execute vast murals for public
commissions, such as still survive in the Hall of Weddings at the mairie of
the XIX arrondissement and the ceiling of the buffet of the Gare de Lyons.
Onwards and ever upwards, Gervex painted millionaire's salons and ceilings
for the Elysees Palace. In the Belle Epoque years, his undoubted talent for
painting electric light made him favoured choice for showing high society
dining in the Bois de Boulogne.
Portraits were bread and butter to Gervex, although he showed no very great
talent for them. Singer Sargent's bravura effects always eluded him. But
even as his commissions took him into the highest ranks of society - even
the Russian Royal Family, he still paid homage to early days. He was still,
a 'painter of modern life', follower - at however far a distance - of Degas
and Manet. Hence, we still find him painting scenes such as the wistful
cocotte, umbrella on the table, who anxiously awaits her companion for the
night in a smart restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne.
This is a hugely enjoyable exhibition, even though of a painter who rarely
rose above third-rate. Only now and then is he better than that, for
example, in oil sketches of his wife nursing their daughter or asleep on the
deck of the splendiferous yacht of the American tycoon, James Gordon Bennet.
The book accompanying the show will delight all who love the Belle Epoque,
and is rich above all in the contributions made by Gervex's great-grandson.
And do keep your eyes skinned; propped in a cellar, or hanging in some
drawingroom, you just might happen to see a nude in a black velvet mask or a
Nana look-alike dressing in a theatre loge . . . There are many Gervexes yet
to be unearthed; with a vengeance, the arriviste master is coming in from
the cold.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Second-hand images of the human body - Lynn MacRitchie
reviews the work of Marlene Dumas at the ICA gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chimera that artists, especially younger ones, no longer paint, or if
they do they certainly do not paint people, hovers over much current chatter
about the visual arts. It is, of course, so much nonsense. The human figure
is still the chosen subject of many young painters, although they may not
approach it in the traditional manner of, say, Lucien Freud, whose lifetime
contemplation of the model in the studio will be celebrated at the
Whitechapel Gallery this autumn.
A considerable group of young artists in the US such as Raymond Pettibon or
Mike Kelley (some of whom were represented at the excellent 'Irony &amp;
Ecstasy' show at the Salama Caro Gallery in London earlier this summer) are
using drawing and painting to explore the representation of the figure.
Their source material, however, is much more likely to be found in the
detritus of contemporary media images of the body, porn magazines, comic
books and advertisements, than in the life class.
In Europe, the leading exponent of this school of figuration is Marlene
Dumas, whose powerful and disturbing work can now be seen at the ICA.
Like many painters of the human form before her (Degas or Manet to name but
two), Dumas chooses to work from photographs. Unlike them, she works
exclusively from photographic images, either taken by herself with a
Polaroid camera or found in the pages of books, newspapers or magazines.
These make up a store of images from which she selects, exploring their
possibilities in series of oil paintings and watercolour drawings. 'It is
not the relationship between painting and photography that is the most
prominent question today,' she explains. 'The fact is that the photographic,
not photography as a specific medium but as a particular mode of signifying,
is affecting all the arts at the moment.'
Her subjects, even before she begins to work on them, have already been
through one process of transformation, leaving her free to remake them anew
in paint, or, as she expresses it, 'My people were all shot by a camera,
framed, before I painted them. They didn't know I'd do this to them . . .'
The earliest works in the show are portrait heads, of family, friends and
strangers, painted in light washes of intense colour. Titles are important.
'Evil is banal,' 1984, shows a young woman whose orange gold hair stands out
in Bonnard-like contrast against a pale pink cheek and purple shadowed
shoulder. A large nude of 1987 titled 'The Particularity of Nakedness' is
the only male example in a series of studies of a horizontal, naked figure,
and the only one to function as a portrait, whose subject, echoing, Manet's
'Olympia', returns the viewer's stare.
Others show a naked woman, lying prone across a table in 'Waiting for
Meaning' 1988, or, in 'Snowhite and the broken arm' representing the artist,
prone, helpless, polaroids scattered on the floor, camera clutched in her
useless hand, unable to shoot back at the greedy gaze of seven small boys.
The next series is scenes of children, photographed at school, in obedient
lines or groups. 'The Dance', 1992, shows four little girls, seen from the
back, hand in hand before an empty, threatening space. Little girls remain a
dominant theme in her later work, while 'The First Humans' 1991, portrays
four new born babies in studies the size of full length adult portraits. Her
latest works are based on photographs from porn magazines.
At Documenta 9 in Kassel last year, Dumas filled a tiny turret room with
monochrome watercolour sketches of young girls, a series based on the story
of Salome. After the wide installation filled spaces below, their intimacy
was a shock, like finding oneself suddenly naked in front of strangers, a
state which although inadvertent may provoke harm. That is the condition of
Dumas' subjects. Caught first by the camera, then by the painter, something
indeed has been 'done' to them. In the process of their double
objectification, they have been transformed. These babies are not innocent,
but redolent with the possibility of evil. These children line up smiling in
the playground and we see gas chambers. The stained sheet held out labelled
'Evidence of Virtue' signifies its opposite, innocence betrayed. The 'Peer
Group' child exposed naked by her playmates horrifies us with our own
thoughts of abuse.
All this is done with the simplest of means - naked bodies suggested by a
swift wash of watercolour in a manner which recalls the grace and economy of
Beuys, a use of oil paint in which sombre strokes of grey and blue are
pulled into meaning by vibrant details - the scarlet slippers in 'The
Window', 1991, or the shocking pink mouth of 'Girl with Lipstick', 1992.
Dumas' painterly exploration of these second-hand images of the body reminds
us that all human horrors have already been committed, recorded and wait
only to be repeated, by people just like ourselves. Only the porno
performers seem innocent, the watercolour sketches of their endless,
wearying display finally returning their bodies to the mystery of the
unknowable.

Contemporary Arts, The Mall, London, SW1Y 5AH.

   Clorox Co. said profit in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 rose 23% to $34.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $28.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 10% to $325.5 million from $295.9 million. 

   For its nine months, profit increased 31% to $95.9 million, or $1.78 a share, from $73.3 million, or $1.37 a share. 
Sales rose 11% to $871.5 million from $784.3 million. 
Per-share earnings for both periods were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split last June. 

   The Oakland, Calif.-based company attributed its improved performance to increased shipments of the company's household grocery brands, food service products, and internationally marketed brands. 

   The maker of food, household products and architectural paints and stains said it expects to report an "excellent" fiscal year. 
Clorox added it anticipates "good" operating results for its fourth quarter while it moves ahead with its introduction of Clorox Super Detergent.

THE PUSH AND PANT OF VIRTUE'S NORTHERN ENGLAND LANDSCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of walking through fields and small towns in Northern England last 
May, I finally began to understand why John Virtue's works look the way they 
do. After a while, the look of the landscape and the action of climbing and 
striding through it begin to merge, as if you couldn't visualize the view from 
a hill without recalling the pant and push to get there. 
</P>
<P>
On first glance, Virtue's large, shellac-stiffened black-and-white charcoal 
drawings appear to be regularly rising and falling abstract designs organized 
into grid formats. Closer inspection reveals a series of shadowy views of 
huddled villages, undulating hills, meandering fences, tipsy chimneys and 
shrouded Jane Eyre-ish houses. Puddles and lashings of black ink and drifts of 
white gouache envelop hill and dale in an elemental fury of wind, snow and 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Virtue once worked as a postman in his native Lancashire, which obliged him 
constantly to walk around his own village. A decade ago, organizing the sheaves 
of small drawings he made into grid formats provided him a way out of his early 
impasse as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
In recent compositions he adeptly varies rhythm and mood by increasing or 
decreasing the amount of blackness, the size of the individual scene and the 
massing of images -- albeit always within a distinctly minor key. 
</P>
<P>
The pieces that don't work are the tiny single drawings. They're too flatly 
naturalistic and too sweetly miniaturized. Most disappointingly, they lack the 
insistent rhythmic effects of Virtue's vast patchworks of dark and light. 
Conversely, "Landscape No. 88," which contains 180 images, is the densest and 
richest piece in the show. A fine-grained all-over pattern, like an overgrowth 
of bracken, separates the imagery from the viewer much as tangled tree limbs 
screen the courtiers who've slept through 100 years in Act III of the ballet 
"Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Were Virtue a different kind of artist, one might see a social program here: a 
fond commentary on small towns slumbering through late 20th-Century upheaval. 
But he seems more preoccupied by the history of possibilities within the world 
of art: ways of expressing fidelity to what the eye sees, emotional attachment, 
and the coolly rational workings of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
His work is related in various ways to the dense, small-scale landscape 
etchings of his 18th-Century countryman Samuel Palmer, the art of his 
20th-Century countrymen and fellow walkers Richard Long and Hamish Fulton, the 
organizational strategies of Minimalism and the nervous, highly personal 
"handwriting" that came into its own with Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
"Subversive Classicism Subverted" is the title for a miscellany of work by 
veteran Los Angeles painter Llyn Foulkes, Austrian artist Arnulf Rainer and 
Yasumasa Morimura, a young Japanese artist. 
</P>
<P>
Foulkes' line-up of small portraits of men is disfigured by Elephant Man 
swellings, dried blood and various collaged elements: cartoon eyes, a 
Dada-esque mask, a TV screen. They seem to be ordinary guys in drip-dry shirts 
who got mixed up in some nasty business -- got their faces bashed in, their 
brains rearranged -- by the same faceless enemy, the callousness of modern 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer, who first came to avant-garde prominence in the '50s and '60s, when he 
covered paintings by various artists with monochromatic coats of paint, is 
probably best known for drawings on photographs of his own face and body. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s he began using photographs of works by other artists. "Eight 
Paintings Over Works by F.X. Messerschmidt," from 1976-77, consists of large 
photographs of blandly classical sculptures of men's heads that Rainer defaced 
with a drizzle of black doodles. A darkly antic gesture, it suggests a primal 
rage against figures of perfection or authority, a need to make one's mark by 
cutting the other guy down to size. 
</P>
<P>
Morimura is the most genuinely "subversive" artist in the show. Although he 
belongs to the vast ranks of those who find sport in reworking paintings by 
icons of Western art, his elaborately rigged, posed and over-painted color 
photographs deal freshly and mischievously with cross-cultural and transsexual 
notions. 
</P>
<P>
In "Portrait (Fugato)," his largest set-piece, he inserts his own, 
incongruously blonde-wigged head and torso on Edouard Manet's nude prostitute, 
Olympia. Various subsidiary elements in the famous painting of that name are 
spruced up with Japanese textiles, flashy ornaments and anachronistic 
brushwork. Most obviously, the piece mocks the longstanding passion among 
Japanese for tasteful French art, which has reached a crescendo in recent 
big-ticket Impressionist auctions. "Olympia," on the other hand, cuts too close 
to the bone. Olympia's blatant stare and the pride of place devoted to the 
black servant call into question some ticklish issues for the Japanese: the 
still-lagging emancipation of women, the role of sex in a prudish society and a 
homogeneous society's unwitting acceptance of black stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The imagery also plays on specifically Japanese artistic traditions. Posing as 
a woman has time-honored roots in Kabuki theater, in which certain male actors 
(onnagata) specialize in women's roles. The chief figures portrayed in Ukiyo-e 
woodblock prints, too, were either idle, sensuous woman, elaborately dressed, 
or actors who played women's roles. By slipping into the role of the onnagata, 
Morimura becomes the perfect commentator, at once embracing and unmasking his 
culture.

<P>
Modern Classics: Alfred Stieglitz and Diane Arbus are the odd couple in G. Ray 
Hawkins' inaugural show at his gallery's new Santa Monica location. But both 
photographers are represented with what have come to be considered classic 
images. In Arbus' case, it shows how little time it takes to become a classic 
these days, and how quickly our eyes adapt to what was once widely thought 
downright peculiar if not repellent. 
</P>
<P>
The Stieglitz photogravures from the first decade of the 20th-Century are 
vintage prints originally published in Stieglitz's famous modern art magazine, 
Camera Work, and suffused with the foggy grays beloved of the "pictorial" 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar views of New York City are here: the uncluttered skyline of "Lower 
Manhattan," with a steamer puffing smoke against billowing clouds, a huge 
construction scaffolding looming over quaint mansard roofs and a streetcar in 
"Old and New New York." Other old friends include "The Steerage," the 
much-reproduced image of anxious-looking immigrants waiting to dock. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Arbus prints -- all but two printed by an assistant but signed by the 
artist -- date from 1962 to 1970, a year before she died. Her most identifiable 
subjects were the kind of people children are taught not to stare at on the 
street, people who don't look "normal" either physically or mentally, or both. 
And yet it is the fidgeting, shouting boy -- identified in the accompanying 
description as retarded -- who shows the only spark of life in a portrait of a 
zombie-like Brooklyn family out for a Sunday stroll. 
</P>
<P>
But this particular selection of photographs is largely composed of images more 
broadly about the rituals and relationships of contemporary middle-class life 
-- the way women chose to deck themselves out in makeup and teased hair, the 
cheesy plastic, fringe and tinsel-bedecked splendor of a Levittown living room 
at Christmas, or the way each member of a suburban family relaxed in a private, 
touch-me-not cocoon on their spacious lawn. With a distance of two decades, 
Arbus seems to be more about style as a projection of the undercurrents of a 
culture.

MURALIST ASKS CITY TO PAY FOR WHITEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Before they disappeared, they were four of the most engaging faces in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There was the middle-aged man in glasses -- solid, direct, slightly 
authoritarian as he looked you right in the eye. Opposite was his wife -- 
eyebrows arched over a gentle, worried smile. 
</P>
<P>
There was a younger man, dark and intense, staring across the street -- 
directly into the pretty, passive face of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, they brightened the gloomy Sunset Boulevard underpass in Echo 
Park with such a glow of personality that they landed on the cover of the book 
"L.A. Wall Art." 
</P>
<P>
The faces disappeared earlier this year when a contractor visited the underpass 
as part of an assignment to eradicate graffiti on city property. When the job 
was done, white paint covered the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The former gang member who painted the faces is locked in a tug of war with the 
city over who should be responsible when the government destroys a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, 29-year-old electrician Ruben Brucelyn, is not seeking compensation 
for loss of the mural -- merely to be reimbursed for his costs so he can 
repaint the work, which he created with private donations under the guidance of 
Los Angeles muralist Kent Twitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Brucelyn has presented the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance an invoice for 
$2,500 to cover paint and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding that it was probably a mistake to paint over the mural, city 
officials have so far ignored the request. The burden falls on muralists to 
remove graffiti from their works if they don't want the city involved, 
according to Curtis Bianchi, general superintendent in the Bureau of Street 
Maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti "must be taken care of very quickly or it's just like an explosion 
happens," Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the crew that painted over Brucelyn's mural was acting under a policy 
calling for the removal of graffiti from city property within 48 hours. The 
city retains a private contractor, Graffiti Prevention Systems, to patrol 
public structures. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute dates to Jan. 8, when a crew was sent to the Sunset bridge, which 
crosses heavily traveled Glendale Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that there are what I would consider to be unauthorized murals 
throughout the city," Bianchi said. "Many have been painted over." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Brucelyn's 1985 work was not unauthorized. He had received 
approval of the design from the city's Cultural Affairs Department and had 
personally kept it free of graffiti for three years. He said he had applied a 
protective coating and only needed to rub the graffiti off with solvent and 
touch up the paint underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Brucelyn said he arrived on the scene just as workers were burying the faces 
under swaths of white paint. He protested, but they continued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crushed, devastated," the artist said in a letter of complaint to 
Bianchi. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he asked for funds to repaint the faces. If necessary, he will file 
a formal claim against the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mural had more significance to Brucelyn and Echo Park than the commuter 
passing through the tunnel could have guessed. The faces were based on real 
people -- the younger man being Brucelyn himself. The others are those who 
helped him escape gang life. 
</P>
<P>
The older man in the mural was based on Harold Helms, pastor of Angelus Temple, 
the white domed church beside Echo Park Lake. He runs a Spanish-language 
ministry and outreach programs for gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to be a real bona fide tough gang kid," muralist Twitchell said of 
Brucelyn. "He met his wife who was a Christian, a smart, savvy young woman. He 
began going to church with her. It changed his life into a positive life." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell also had a role in the turnaround. The two met in 1984, when Brucelyn 
stopped on the Harbor Freeway to watch Twitchell work on the faces he was 
commissioned to paint on freeway walls for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell created the stencil-like forms for the young electrician's first 
murals, the Olympic runners on the stairway west of Echo Park Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Brucelyn took a detour from his art projects in 1988 to write and produce a 
play, "Smile Now, Cry Later," depicting the ravages of the gang culture. Last 
year, he rebuilt his house in Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
With all that going on, he admitted, he neglected the faces mural during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, Brucelyn said, the city should have warned him of its intentions 
before destroying his work. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi said the contractor had no way of finding Brucelyn because he did not 
apply for permits to paint on city property. "We don't know who the artist is. 
We have no permit. We have no record," Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such mishaps in the future, Bianchi said he will propose permit 
guidelines so that anyone who comes to City Hall with a mural proposal can be 
given a package listing the steps to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Twitchell has some advice for his protege. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd stay away from underpasses," Twitchell said. "You can't win the fight 
against destruction. A creator can't win a fight against a destroyer."

   NEW YORK -- Art dealers and auction houses are trying to
turn Latin American art into the next big-boom market,
capitalizing on the economic rebound in Latin America.
   Eighteen months ago, no painting by a Latin American
artist had sold for a million dollars. Now, five have cracked
the million-dollar barrier at auction in the U.S., including
three paintings sold just last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A 1942 Diego Rivera portrait of a Mexican woman burdened
with a huge basket of flowers brought a record $2.9 million
at Christie's International PLC's major Latin American
auction in New York, and record prices were paid for works by
more than a dozen other Latin American artists.
   The interest in Latin American art comes at a time when
the auction houses are eager to find a new "hot market" amid
the slump in Impressionist and other traditional art markets.
While the auction houses have been phenomenally successful in
selling collectibles lately, toys, rock n' roll memorabilia
and comic books only fetch so much.
   Latin Americans have been active buyers at auctions of
jewelry and European paintings and furniture, and it is only
logical to target them as a major buying force. Christopher
Davidge, managing director of Christie's, says the
London-based auction house is targeting the Latin American
market because "the industrialization of third world
countries throws up great personal wealth."
   But Latin Americans at last week's series of auction sales
in New York proved to be no Japanese. The powerful, brooding,
expressive paintings of Latin American artists such as
Rivera, Rufino Tamayo and Roberto Matta still have a narrow
market. And despite the record prices, the sales were a mixed
bag.
   At Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s evening sale of Latin
American art last week, 28% of the paintings didn't sell, but
several paintings sold for multiples of the prices that the
auction house expected. Fidelio Ponce de Leon's 1941 portrait
"Five Women," once owned by director Alfred Hitchcock, sold
for $104,500, about five times what Sotheby's had expected.
   Altogether, Sotheby's raised about $12 million at its
three Latin American sales in New York, a tidy sum
considering that sales from Sotheby's flagship department,
Impressionist paintings, totaled $33 million this fall.
   But the next evening at Christie's, buyers' appetite for
Latin American art slacked off. About 58% of the Latin
American art failed to sell, and few works sold for higher
than expected prices. There were even audible groans when
some works by name artists were marooned on the auction
block, including two sculptures by Fernando Botero and two
surrealist works by Matta; the Mattas were estimated by
Christie's relatively inexpensively at less than $100,000
each.
   A Botero sketch of oversized, fattened pears -- one of 20
Botero works that hit the auction block over the three-day
period -- received no bids whatsoever. The sketch was
estimated to sell for about $150,000.
   Despite the uneven market, collectors agree that
20th-century Latin American art, at its best, is comparable
to top-quality European and American works. At the top of the
Latin American art market are works painted by early
20th-century masters Diego Rivera, a muralist best known for
his paintings of Mexican workers, and Frida Kahlo, whose most
famous works are her intense and compelling self-portraits.
Later in the century, Roberto Matta and Wilfredo Lam, both
surrealist painters, dominated the Latin American paintings
field, along with Rufino Tamayo, a Mexican painter heavily
influenced by European cubists. Better-quality paintings by
these artists routinely fetch six figures.
   In contemporary art, the leading Latin American artists
include Claudio Bravo, whose "Self Portrait," a painting of
leather boots and blue jeans, sold for $495,000 last week at
Sotheby's, tripling his previous record. The Latin American
artist who is perhaps one of the best known in the U.S. is
Colombia's Botero. His gargantuan, fat-faced figures are in
many U.S. museum collections, and last week one of his works
fetched $1 million at auction.
   With the surge in the Mexican stock market and economic
recovery in some Latin American nations, the auction houses
are trying to make the paintings of top Mexican, Venezuelan,
Argentinian and Colombian artists status symbols for wealthy
Latin American collectors.
   Meanwhile, as Americans and Europeans discover the
economies and stock markets of Latin America, "the world is
discovering the artistic traditions of the region at a time
when people are looking for fresh art," says Robert D.
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
   Ironically, only last April, Sotheby's saw the Latin
American market as so moribund that the auction house
canceled its spring sale of Latin American paintings and
strongly considered shutting down its Latin American art
department.
   However, Sotheby's changed its mind after Christie's made
money at its spring Latin American sale. "Let's face it, the
dollar is what counts, and we rang up about $12 million,"
says Lisa Palmer, head of Christie's Latin American art
department.
   Sotheby's realized it had some apologizing to do. Diana D.
Brooks, president of the company's Sotheby's Inc. auction
unit, went on two separate business trips to Latin America
last month. In Mexico, her five-person entourage included the
former No. 2 person in the firm's Impressionist paintings
department. On her second visit, Mrs. Brooks went to Rio de
Janiero, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires in a visit that some in
the art world dubbed the "eat crow" trip.
   "The decision we made was not to whitewash it, but to tell
our clients we made a mistake," Mrs. Brooks says.
Fortunately, "the Latin American clients are very forgiving."
   In each city, Sotheby's threw elaborate parties for
clients. At the final reception, held a week ago in New York
on the eve of the Sotheby's major Latin American paintings
sale a week ago, 300 people were expected, and 1,200 showed
up; the auction house ran out of clean glasses halfway
through the evening.
   The auction houses are getting help in trying to generate
excitement about Latin American art. Madonna owns a few
paintings by Frida Kahlo, the Mexican artist who has recently
achieved near cult status in the art world; the rock star has
said in interviews that she has commissioned a screenplay in
which she would star as Kahlo.
   Moreover, the auction houses have timing on their side.
The approaching 500-year anniversary of Christopher
Columbus's voyage to America, plus the Olympics in Barcelona,
"are going to make 1992 very much a Latin year," said
Goldman's Mr. Hormats.
   But, now, amid the record prices, there's concern that
strength in the market for at least some Latin American
artists is a fad. "I'm not saying we're going to be `in'
forever," says Mary-Anne Martin, one of the leading dealers
in the field, who paid a record price for a Kahlo in 1990.
"But if there is any worth in these {artworks}, they'll
manage to survive the fad. There are some very good things in
this market, and people see real value there."

   A cat that apparently preferred France to
West Germany walked 620 miles to its old home here, the feline's
former owner says.
   Madeline Martinet said her cat, Gribouille, appeared on her
doorstep in this central French city this week, nearly two years
after he was reported missing from Reutlingen, a West German town
near Stuttgart.
   Gribouille was 2 months old when Mrs. Martinet gave him away in
July 1986 to her neighbor, who later moved to Reutlingen. The
former neighbor told Mrs. Martinet that the cat disappeared in
October 1986.
   ``My son and daughter-in-law found him sick and sleeping in
front of my front door'' on Sunday night, Mrs. Martinet said. ``My
son said, `Why, it's Gribouille.' Then the cat lifted its head and
cried.''
   A veterinarian said the cat had an eye infection, and prescribed
antibiotics. Despite the infection and malnutrition, the cat seems
to be recovering, Mrs. Martinet said.
   ``He has the same spots and a particular mew that he mews when I
speak to him,'' she said. ``It's definitely little Gribouille.''
   She said she told her former neighbor on Thursday that
Gribouille had been found.
   ``But this time, we are going to keep him,'' said Mrs. Martinet.
``I don't think he liked Germany.''

   Paint, pennants and props that were part
of the pomp of the 1984 Olympic Games now form the backdrop for
motorcycle races, courtesy of Summer Games buff Chris Agajanian.
   ``I love that Olympics stuff,'' said Agajanian, who owns Ascot
Park raceway in this Los Angeles suburb _ and $300,000 worth of
Olympics goods.
   There's bunting everywhere, shining in the still familiar
``clean aqua,'' ``hot magenta'' and ``rich chrome yellow'' hues
said by the planners of the 1984 Games to represent the Southern
California spirit.
   Brightly colored pennants hang on the walls between billboards
promoting spark plugs, chewing tobacco and bail bond agencies.
   The faded, scratched victory stands, which still have the
Olympic rings and star symbols visible, are planted in the race
track infield amid plastic pink flamingoes.
   Agajanian said that when he heard that a lot of the Olympic
furnishings were being auctioned, he started bidding.
   ``I ended up buying 5,000 seats from the swim stadium and some
of the ticket booths,'' he said recently. ``I got some tents. Some
flags. Some bunting. Some fencing. Some bullhorns.
   ``And I bought hundreds of gallons of Olympics paint. Used it
all over.''
   Agajanian has a collection of Olympic programs, ticket stubs,
parking passes, souvenir medallions and the like in a drawer in his
office.
   ``I've got more stuff in a warehouse,'' Agajanian said.
``Shirts. Uniforms. Even some of those blazers.
   ``But those colors? I'd never wear one of 'em.''

<HL> PPG to Acquire Grow Group Inc. At $16.625 a Share </HL>

   PPG Industries Inc., trying to bolster its paint business, said it agreed to buy Grow Group Inc. for $16.625 a share, or about $233 million. 

   PPG said the assumption of Grow Group debt would bring its total cost to about $300 million. 

   Grow Group said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. acted as its adviser in evaluating the offer. 
Drexel was retained by Grow Group in July, shortly after an investor group including Edward S. Buchanan, a Massachusetts banker, said it had acquired a 6.7% stake and was considering a tender offer. 

   Last Thursday, Grow Group announced that it was in talks with a possible buyer. 
After the announcement, its stock jumped $2.625 to close at $15.625. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Grow Group closed at $15.50, off 12.5 cents. 
The PPG announcement was made after the market closed. 

   Grow Group has 14 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including a Series C cumulative convertible preferred stock and 8.5% convertible debentures, both of which are expected to be redeemed before the merger. 
The Series C will be redeemed at $100 a share, and the convertible debentures, due in 2006, will be redeemed at $1,068 per $1,000 principal amount. 
The Series P nonredeemable cumulative preferred stock will remain outstanding. 

   Under the agreement approved by both boards, PPG has the option to buy about 2.8 million shares of Grow's authorized but unissued common at $16.625 a share. 
PPG also has the right to terminate the merger agreement during a due-diligence period ending Sept. 6. 

   The addition of Grow Group, a New York-based maker of trade paints and chemical coatings, should help expand PPG's own trade paint business. 

   Trade paints, used by consumers and contractors for homes and buildings, contribute only about $200 million of PPG's $5.2 billion in sales. 
But the company has been trying to expand its share of the market, which is $37 billion world-wide. 

   "Grow Group has strength in that business and we're looking for ways to improve our performance in that area," PPG said. 
About 70% of Grow Group's $380 million in sales is in the coatings and chemicals business, including trade paints. 
Grow Group also has a variety of consumer and professional products, including swimming pool chemicals, spray paints and varnishes. 

   John Frankola, an analyst with Parker Hunter Inc., said Grow Group will also provide PPG with a new distribution system. 
PPG changed its strategy for marketing its trade paints a few years ago by closing its retail Pittsburgh Paint stores. 
Since then, the company has been trying to establish new sources of distribution. 
"This could aid PPG in getting more trade paints into the market," he said.

   Clorox Co. said Henkel KGaA plans to increase its Clorox common stock holdings to as much as 30% from a current stake of 24.7%. 

   Dusseldorf, West Germany-based Henkel will acquire the shares through purchases on the open market, Clorox said, and won't increase its position beyond 30% "for the foreseeable future." 

   Clorox quoted the West German concern as saying Henkel views its holdings in the company as an investment, and has no plans to take an active role in Clorox management. 
Henkel will continue to have two representatives on Clorox's 15-member board. 

   A spokesman said Clorox views Henkel's increased stake as "a good development for the company and its shareholders." 
He cited a joint venture the two concerns operate in Spain and technology exchanges between the companies as evidence of the "close relationship" between them. 

   Clorox is a grocery products concern that also makes paints, stains and products for the food-service industry. 
Henkel produces household products and chemical specialties. 

   Henkel currently owns 23%, or an indicated 6,102,000, of Clorox's 26.7 million common shares outstanding. 
The West German concern also holds a subordinated note convertible into 600,000 common shares, or an about 1.7% additional stake. 

   Clorox said the 30% ceiling on Henkel's stake would include the equivalent shares represented by the note. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Clorox closed yesterday at $61.50, up $2.125.

FT  26 APR 94 / Arts: Impressionism - back to basics / At the Grand Palais,
William Packer finds the 1859 Paris Salon artists committed to realism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The closer one looks into the origins of anything the more ambiguous they
become, and the further back they go. Where should we look for the origins
of Impressionism? To the landscape and genre realism of the Dutch 17th
century? Certainly: and to the English 18th and early 19th centuries,
Gainsborough and Wilson, Constable and Turner? Indeed: and to late Titian?
Perhaps: and what about Rembrandt? Yes, if Courbet is to be considered in
such a context. And the Spanish connection, from Velasquez to Goya? Of
course, if Manet is to have anything to do with it.
But these are profound questions, that bespeak a whole ramification of
art-historical possibility. Whatever its implications, the splendid
exhibition at the Grand Palais addresses itself to a narrower period and
more immediate antecedents. This Origins of Impressionism is an exhibition
of French painting set in a French context, and one moreover that continues
ensemble the remarkable series by which the Reunion des musees nationaux,
these 15 years past, has been giving us definitive retrospective studies of
the Impressionist and post-Impressionist masters, one by one.
The starting point is the Salon of 1859 at which, of the future major
figures, only the young Pissarro was to be found. Ten years on and they were
all showing there, Monet and Manet, Renoir and Degas, almost as a matter of
course. The Salon indeed supplied the constant critical context for the art
of the period. The only pity is that more has not been made of it as an
actual presence: for the paintings taken to stand for it in 1859, which
include Bouguereau, Puvis de Chavannes, Corot, Delacroix, a
pre-Raphaelitesque Jules Breton and a magnificent large Daubigny riverscape,
are done with perfunctorily in the first two rooms.
Even so, the point is well made and two related myths usefully exploded:
that, though the Salon may have had its good years and its bad ('no
explosion: nothing of unknown genius' grumbled Baudelaire of 1859), it was
never entirely hostile to the young or controversial; and nor were the young
themselves averse to taking their chances of selection. And how close these
young painters were, in their several ways, to the more general
preoccupations of the day; and, as yet, how far from Impressionism. Here we
follow those interests through the 1860s, set out together in successive
galleries: history painting, with its admixture of symbolism; realism; the
nude; the portrait; the still-life; the landscape; the incidents of the
everyday.
The borders between these categories, of course, are never sealed nor even
clear, the cross-overs and mutual intrusions constant and instinctive. Degas
gives us a scene of medieval atrocity as conscientious in its detail as any
pre-Raphaelite, yet in the very pose of its nudes, it anticipates the figure
studies of his later years. The Manet of 'the Angels at the tomb of Christ'
is as dramatic in its presentation as a Caravaggio and, in the figure of
Christ himself, as confrontationally realist in its nudity as his own
'Olympia'.
This last, indeed, so provoked Courbet by her brazen, matter-of-fact
nakedness, that he replied with his own more suitably symbolic version of
the reclining and ecstatic woman, la Femme au perroquet. Manet replied in
his turn with his own 'Woman with a Parrot', though now a full-length
portrait of a young woman in a long white morning-gown, standing by her
pet's perch. All three are shown, altogether a most satisfying if
ill-tempered exchange of masterpieces.
The question of realism lies at the heart of it all. Yet in what does that
realism consist and to what degree should it be tempered? Is it the symbolic
realism of Degas' Spartan boys and girls of 1860, or is it the no less
symbolic but plein air realism of Bazille's young men at their bathing party
of 1869? Is the truth of modern life rather the boats and light dancing on
the water at la Grenouillere, of Renoir and Monet in 1869, or that of Degas'
darkly ambiguous interior, le Viol, of the same year? At the end of the
decade we find Courbet still committed to realism in its social aspect, with
his poor village woman in the snow, with her child and goat and bundle of
firewood. And there beside it is Monet's magpie sitting on the gate, and the
image simply of farm and field and hedgerow in the snow, all pink and blue
and violet shadow.
This is an exhibition full of wonderful, ravishing things. But set out as it
is, and quite rightly so, neither by chronology nor by artist but in
thematic groups, it raises a question it can hardly answer. Here was the
modern painting of the day, and young artists who knew each other and even
worked together, but were clearly doing different things. Realism and
symbolism, yes: and the formal portrait and the nude, and the landscape and
the genre scene: but Impressionism? Not quite yet: indeed, the more we look
into it, the more we wonder whether there was ever to be any such thing at
all.

FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: Balthus - the shock of the old / Art in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old people are not expected to shock, except by the sobering spectacle of
their own decay. As for an old, world-famous artist, he or she is almost by
definition one who no longer shocks the public. After two generations, the
public feels it knows that artist's work. And yet, our idea of the artist's
work will inevitably be largely ersatz, formed by the publishing industry's
choice of images for coffee-table books, posters, art calendars and
postcards.
Certain artists' work more easily becomes ersatz than others. Lowry is one,
Balthus is another. Balthus is now 85 and his paintings (at least, the most
'Balthusian' of them) have for decades been among the most recognisable of
any artist still living. As for the real thing, however, it is not easily
seen; Balthus is still owned largely by private collectors and not by
museums. How odd, even perverse, then, that the Musee des Beaux-Arts in
Lausanne, Switzerland, has made so little fuss about Balthus, the first
major retrospective since the Paris/New York shows of 1983-4.
The Lausanne museum is honouring Balthus, who has lived in the canton of
Vaud for the past 15 years. Originally, the exhibition was to have focused
on paintings associated with Switzerland, where the artist spent his
childhood and adolescence and the war years from 1940. But Balthus himself
was enthused by the idea, collectors responded generously, and the result is
a major exhibition which moreover looks marvellous. More than 50 paintings,
30 drawings and watercolours are spaciously hung in the lofty white
galleries.
They include a good number of the painter's best-known paintings from the
1930s to 1950s; 'The Street', 'Le Passage du Commerce Saint-Andre', 'The
Children', 'Therese', and 'Les Beaux Jours'. As well as the figure
paintings, there are a fascinating group of the landscapes which are the
less well-known side of Balthus's work.
'The Mountain' (1937) is an extraordinarily declamatory and even crude
painting of a party of young walkers revelling in the panoramic grandeur of
the Alps. They respond with exhilaration to the azure sky, the dizzy views.
But there is also seduction in the heat. One of the two girls is still fast
asleep on the velvet turf, wrapped in a personal solitude which is typically
Balthus.
After the war, landscapes in France and more recently Italy have become
places of timeless enchantment. Tiny figures endowed with the poise of
Gicaometti sculptures herd their cows or call in a white horse from the
orchard. They are lost in a pastoral world of Virgilian perfection. In his
youth, Balthus famously copied the frescoes of Piero della Francesco and
Masacio. His landscapes have the quality of missing fragments from the
background of a fresco.
The warders are on the alert to keep visitors far enough away from Balthus's
surfaces. Already in 'La Victime' of 1937, the paint is thick, mottled,
clotted. The technique of putting layer upon layer of pigment means that
from close up, 'Large landscape with Cows' painted at the Chateau de Chassy
in 1959 is almost like paint cohering to a pile rug. The image floats on the
surface. No reproduction of Balthus's work ever begins to convey this
extraordinary texture.
If the texture of the real thing is a surprise, so too may be the sombreness
of Balthus's palette, especially in the early years. Reproductions tend to
make his work look lighter. Here, the catalogue (not a complete one, by the
way, costing SFr50) is badly at fault. Balthus's colours have become
brighter over the decades, as his famous nudes have become more decorative
and the atmosphere less menacing.
'Young Girl with a Blue Towel' (1958) is an enchantingly pretty painting of
a stocky girl in a bathroom. She is delectably pink and almost herself seems
to radiate light in the brilliance of a summer morning. So far I have
described some of the surprises you may find in the retrospective. What of
the shock of Balthus?
The most recent work in the show, 'Cat and Mirror III', was finished this
summer and is exhibited for the first time. This golden-haired girl on a
couch has an anatomy which is stranger even than the oddest Balthus figures
 -which is saying quite a lot. However, far from being nude like most of her
predecessors, she is fully clad and even rather fashionable, in her luminous
lilac leggings. The couch on which she lies, observed by a tabby cat, is
loaded like a boat with gaudy patterned fabrics.
Were this the only painting by Balthus of a young girl which one had ever
seen, it would be quite mystifying as to why Balthus still has an exotic and
even evil reputation. And yet, it is almost exactly 60 years ago that he
achieved lasting notoriety with his first exhibition in the Galerie Pierre
in Paris. Five large paintings (each 6ft) portrayed situations which were
erotic, even sado-masochistic. The real shocker was 'The Guitar Lesson',
showing a woman teacher sexually assaulting the adolescent girl pupil, bent
across her lap in a clear travesty of a Pieta.
Balthus had found a subject which would never cease to unnerve and even
shock. That particular painting is absent from the show. Even so, there are
a host of young girls, some with long thin limbs like Gothic beauties, some
with rounded limbs and moon faces. For many people, Balthus will for ever be
a dubious artist. They reprehend him for being the classicist who paints a
thoroughly unclassical nude, and more basic still, for being a dirty old man
whose nudes of the '80s show him as still fixated on the Lolita figure.
So yes, Balthus can still be shocking. Indeed, such is the degree of
hysteria in Anglo-Saxon countries about adult exploitation of child
sexuality, it is questionable how many museum directors would feel
comfortable today about staging a retrospective of Balthus, 'Guitar Lesson'
and the rest. In Lausanne they see things differently. The exhibition is
fascinating and full of beautiful images; see it, if you can.

If you linger in Lausanne, close by at Martigny the Fondation Pierre
Gianadda is showing Edgar Degas (150 works; open daily, until November 21).
Henry Darger; The Adventures of the Vivian Girls at the Collection de l'art
brut is deranged, distasteful but curious. The collection itself, formed by
Jean Dubuffet, should be seen. The Fondation de l'Hermitage is showing
Claude Monet and His Friends: works loaned from the Musee Marmottan and
private collections (until September 26). Last month, the Museum of the
Olympics opened down by the lake. It is far more ghastly even than I
imagined, but has some interest as a sign of the times.
Balthus runs until 29 August. Sponsors; Nestle SA, Fondation Nestle pour

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Anti-abortionists linked to theft of 'The Scream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theft of Norway's most famous work of art took a bizarre twist this week
when two ex-communicated, anti-abortion activist priests from the country's
state Lutheran church hinted they may be connected to the crime.
Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' was stolen last Saturday from Norway's National
Gallery in Oslo. The painting had been moved to the first floor of the
gallery to allow easier access to a collection of Munch's emotionally
charged works during a special exhibition coinciding with the Lillehammer
Winter Olympics.
The theft, which took less than one minute and was filmed by video
surveillance cameras, has deeply embarrassed the government and caused a
public outcry in Norway over lax security of the country's art treasures.
On Thursday an anonymous fax linked to Borre Knudsen and Ludvig Nessa, the
two former priests, was sent to the Norwegian press. It showed a drawing of
a foetus with a woman, echoing 'The Scream', and asked the question: 'Which
is of greater value a child or a painting?'
Knudsen, interviewed on NRK national radio, said he would be willing to
steal 'The Scream' to promote his views. He suggested Munch's painting could
be recovered if the controversial anti-abortion film The Silent Scream was
shown on national television.
The investigation continues but many are sceptical about the activists'
connection to the theft and believe the pair may have sought to link
themselves to the theft in a ploy to gain media attention during the Winter
Olympics.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: A weird variety - Why the BT New Contemporaries show
is loaded with references
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public reaction to the work of young artists can provide a measure of
our response to the complex and difficult universe of modern art. Perhaps
because their work is by definition 'unknown', its display can give licence
to express an underlying anxiety about the contemporary art world, that
perplexing place where constant contradictions reduce even sophisticated and
erudite commentators to occasional bursts of bile and which nevertheless
these novitiates still choose to enter. Their work bears the burden of our
own anxiety, wary consumers, faced with a new and unknown product. For just
as the artists must make their offerings naked, without benefit of history,
so the viewers must make their judgments likewise, without the comforting
cloak of consensus.
With this in mind, a hostile response to the BT New Contemporaries
exhibition, which began a national tour in Manchester last week, is not in
itself surprising, but it raises questions about our expectations of
artists, and the myths about their genesis, which are worthy of
consideration. The show was chosen by professionals, two artists, Caroline
Russell and Willie Doherty, and the critic Stuart Morgan, and has a 'look',
a homogeneity which suggests not so much a similarity of original offerings
but the inevitable consensus reached in hammering out a final selection of
27 exhibitors from an open slide submission which attracted more than 1,000
entries. For all the works, however different in form, are couched in the
common language of these difficult times, a language in which no object or
offering is innocent, but comes loaded with references both to history and
the cultural stew of the present.
Thus 'The Hooded Pitohui (Shit Painting 2)' by Chris Ofili, combines his
remaking of Australian Aboriginal paintings with abstraction and the irony
of Piero Manzoni, as well as demonstrating considerable painterly panache.
Another gifted painter is Laura Daly, whose large abstracts feature
multicoloured dashes of paint arranged in vertical columns on single
coloured backgrounds, evoking Jackson Pollock and Ian Davenport, an old
master and a young pro, in a teasing mixture. The references of some of the
other works are more elusive. Objects, whether found or created, are used to
convey resonance, although their meaning may never be quite clear. The fat
white candle lying on the floor with a leather belt round its middle by
Andrew Bannister entitled 'Fuse' plays with sexuality as dynamite, while his
'Cell,' a wall panel made of white ceramic tiles with an inset photograph of
a room, empty but for a white draped bed, suggests isolation and menace.
As well as this reliance on the inherent mysteriousness of objects to lend
substance where content remains obscure, the exhibitors also demonstrate a
need for drama. Edwin David in 'Towards a Museum of Misreading' assembles a
shotgun, a plinth, a reproduction of Rossetti's 'Rape of Proserpine', a
quote from Freud, a chair, a pomegranate and a pile of broken glass to
suggest a museum incident of unknown significance. Edward Harper goes for it
more directly, arranging some green struts, floorboards and a silver salver
on the gallery floor to impersonate Manet's 'The Balcony.' Those spurious
philosophers of our time, the serial killers, also make a guest appearance.
'Handshake with Nilsen, Using Projector, Draws Olympia to the Phone' by
Thomas Sharpe combines a shaky drawing of the famous murderer of young men
with the image of 'Twin Peaks' star Sherilyn Fenn cut into flesh coloured
PVC dotted with plastic toy noses, an array of references bedazzling in its
lunatic range.
Why such weird variety? Why should a mass murderer be as inspiring as a
great painter? It is simple, really. Not for a century or so have visual
artists typically served apprenticeships in a master's studio, learning to
paint or sculpt while assisting in the manufacture of commissions. The
'apprenticeship' of an art student today is likely to be a more lonely
journey, often conducted in a makeshift 'space' staked out within the rooms
of an institution the nature and even name of which may have undergone
several changes during the student's time of attendance. With few immediate
fixed parameters, a young artist's boundaries, the things against which
skill and understanding must be tested, inevitably stretch both infinitely
outwards across the ocean of mass media culture which engulfs us all, and
deep within, with intuition alone guiding the choice of subject and
material.
The mixed media panels by Marcus Coates offer a touching image of the
complexity of allusion and aspiration which may result from a position at
once so knowledgeable and so vulnerable. He has taken details of two
paintings of women by Jan Van Eyck and blown them up photographically,
separating head-dress from head and head from body. The delicate features
thus unadorned gaze out from above his own naked torso, substituted for the
original sumptuously costumed body. His skill has allowed this young artist
to enter history, paraphrasing the masterpiece in the questioning technology
of our times.

<HEAD>Warhol's Red Marilyn Sells For $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Warhol's portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964
depiction of Marilyn Monroe, brought $4 million at auction
Wednesday, a record for a work by the artist.
   The previous high for a Warhol painting was $3.9 million, said
Gloria Harris, a spokeswoman for Christie's. That painting sold
last year, also of the late actress, depicted her face 20 times and
is called ``Marilyn Monroe (Twenty Times).''
   ``Red Marilyn'' had a presale estimate value of between $1.5
million and $2 million. The actual selling price was $4,070,000,
Harris said.
   Harris said the auction Wednesday at Christie's fetched $31.7
million for 60 works of art. The auction of contemporary art
continues Thursday.
   ``Colored Alphabet,'' an oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns
sold for $3.5 million, the second highest price bid on Wednesday
but not a new record for a Johns.
   Other artist records at the Christie's auction included:
   _$715,000 for an Ellsworth Kelly painting, ``Black Triangle With
White.''
   _$880,000 for a Robert Motherwell painting, ``Elegy to the
Spanish Republic No. 134.''
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   ``August Day,'' an oil on canvas painting by Franz Kline sold
for $2.7 million.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow brought $2.2 million.
   ``Things on the Wall'' by Roy Lichtenstein sold for $1,012,000.
   The auction Wednesday at Christie's is the second day of a
12-day selling spree at that auction house and its rival _
Sotheby's. The two houses are expected to sell 4,400 pieces of art
for more than $500 million.
   On Tuesday, record prices were set for 27 contemporary artists
at Sotheby's. Total receipts of $78.6 million there set a record
for a contemporary art auction.
   Another Pollock drip painting, ``Number 8, 1950,'' painting sold
for $11.5 million at the Sotheby's auction.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer, fetched
$6.2 million.
   Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which depicts a ruby-lipped Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963, sold for $750,000 _ more
than twice its presale estimate.
   On Saturday, a Sotheby's sale of 20th Century decorative arts
will include a two-story town house commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III.
   Christie's on May 10 and 11 will feature five Monets, seven
Picassos, 10 Renoir and four works by Degas.

Put in Play in Wake
Of $39.9 Million Sale

Christie's Predicts 'Le Pont'
Will Bring No. 2 Price
For Painting at Auction

<TEXT>
   The eye-popping sale of a Vincent van Gogh sunflower painting this month for $39.9 million has coaxed another major work by the Dutch artist onto the auction block. 

   The London-based auction house Christie's International PLC said it will auction off "Le Pont de Trinquetaille," an important painting of a bridge by van Gogh, on June 29 in London. 
A Christie's spokesman predicted that Le Pont will become "the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction." 
Christie's said the painting has been owned by the Kramarsky family of New York for more than 50 years. 

   Le Pont, once owned by van Gogh's sister-in-law, was shown at a major exhibition in Amsterdam in 1905 and eventually was bought by Siegfried Kramarsky in 1932 at a Paris sale. 

   Art specialists said the Kramarsky family's art collection is considered valuable but isn't well publicized. 
The collection was brought to the U.S. from Holland before World War II. 
Some of the works have been lent to museums. 
Le Pont has been on loan for the past three years to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 

   Christopher Burge, who runs Christie's in New York, is wary of predicting that this van Gogh work will engender the frenzied bidding of his sunflower painting, which is a more dazzling, brightly colored and better-known image. 
The sunflower painting was acquired by Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. of Tokyo. 

   The bridge painting, in muted grays and blues, "is an extremely subtle and quiet painting that requires contemplation," Mr. Burge said. 

   Nonetheless, Christie's expects this work easily to exceed the second-highest price ever paid for a work of art, $11 million, in December for a painting by Edouard Manet. 
And many art dealers believe that the price that this second van Gogh masterwork will fetch at auction will have a major influence on the art market in the near future. 

   "This will be a test of the previous price," New York art dealer Richard Feigen said. 
"If the price that this realizes reinforces the market level of the sunflowers, then you'll have a verification the other wasn't just a battle between two bidders." 
This, other dealers say, could unleash a lot of art onto the market. 

   Mr. Burge of Christie's said: "I think we made it clear to people that the van Gogh (sunflowers) was an isolated instance, and it doesn't make every other good impressionist painting worth $30 million to $40 million. 
But we've all been saying for some time that the art market will slow down, and you may see an element (in the near future) of profit-taking in the market, to use a horrid word."

   Artist Jackson Pollack's painting, ``The
Search,'' believed to be his last canvas, fetched $4.84 million _ a
record for a work of contemporary art _ in frenzied bidding at
Sotheby's Monday night, the auction house said.
   The auction, which included works put up for sale by various
owners as well as artist Andy Warhol's personal collection, brought
in $25,954,500, a record for an auction of contemporary art, said
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollack, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney and Richard
Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for over $1 million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' she said. ``People
are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings won't come up
again. People know this is their last shot.''
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' said Ms. Mitchell-Innes.
   The auction of Warhol's personal collection of contemporary art
brought in $5,115,000, with an untitled painting by Twombly
fetching $990,000, the highest bid for a Warhol-owned work.
   Pollack's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, was bought for $4.84 million by an anonyous
Japanese dealer, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. The work, which displays
the artist's drip technique as well as paint applied with a brush
and spattered, had a pre-sale estimate of $3 million to $4 million.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million for Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
in November 1986 and the same amount for Willem de Kooning's ``Pink
Lady'' in May 1987. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid at Monday night's auction was the $1.87
million an American dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a
black and white abstraction, Sotheby's said. Its pre-sale estimate
was $700,000 to $900,000.

SPRAY-PAINT VANDALS MAKE A BIGGER MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Local mural production may be flourishing these days, but mural vandalism via 
graffiti seems to be worse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest hurdle in terms of whether muralists have the incentive to 
keep painting murals," said muralist Kent Twitchell. "If (graffiti vandals) hit 
the one I'm working on now, it'll probably take that incentive right out of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell said that his Olympic freeway murals of artists Lita Albuquerque and 
Jim Morphesis at the 7th Street underpass of the Harbor Freeway, common targets 
for vandals, have been more frequently marred with graffiti recently. What's 
worse is that lately the vandals seem to have forsaken an attitude of "honor 
among thieves" and now scribble directly on the murals' faces, no longer only 
on the blank "negative spaces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell and other muralists believe that gang members defacing their works 
with slogans and symbols are responsible for most of recent rise in graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day five Crips came in here with spray paint and one said, 'I could 
fix that up real nice,' " said Roberto Delgado, referring to the mural he is 
painting at an East Los Angeles housing project. "We were taking bets that it 
would be all covered up. It wasn't, but over the course of time people are 
going to put stuff over it." 
</P>
<P>
Most muralists cover their works with a protective acrylic coating that 
prevents the graffiti from penetrating through, but the graffiti must still be 
cleaned off. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell, with about 20 murals to his credit, is probably the city's most 
prolific artist. He shares Delgado's pessimistic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more graffiti in the last two years since the efforts began to clean 
it up," said Twitchell, who has sued the man who painted over his popular 
"Freeway Lady" mural formerly overlooking the Hollywood Freeway near downtown. 
"Nothing that's being done now seems to be working." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such gloomy observations, efforts to address the problem continue. Some 
are community-based programs that put community members to work cleaning up 
graffiti everywhere. Other programs are more specifically geared toward mural 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Los Angeles Unified School District will offer a mural workshop 
co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Mural Conservancy and Art Educators of America 
which will include mural inspection and conservation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls Unlimited project, which has a 
$250,000 grant from the City of Los Angeles to wage graffiti clean-up efforts 
as well as to get to the root of the problem. By providing youths with such 
constructive outlets as mural painting, city officials hope the youths won't be 
tempted to join gangs or engage in delinquent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
James Anderson, a 22-year-old who is helping Roderick Sykes paint one of the 
Neighborhood Pride murals, believes that the program will work by example. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like telling the young kids that graffiti is not the thing. If you want 
to put something on a wall, why not put a flower or a human being sharing 
something with another human being? Unite together rather than painting gang 
words or symbols."ZAN DUBIN

ARTIST GIVING A FACE LIFT TO MURAL OF MEXICAN HERO; 
</P>
<P>
ART: WILLIE HERRON RACES TO RESTORE HIS IMAGE OF MIGUEL HIDALGO IN TIME FOR THE 
L.A. FESTIVAL.

Something eerie and peculiar happened after Willie Herron painted Mexican 
Revolutionary leader Miguel Hidalgo on the facade of an East Los Angeles 
pharmacy 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Evoking the mystical realism of writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Herron described 
how "odd" that he unwittingly positioned the face of the "Father of Mexican 
Independence" directly over a weak area on the aging farmacia wall. 
</P>
<P>
Odd, he explained, because 18 months later, the face of the priest -- 
decapitated by Spanish soldiers -- fell off the mural wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before I began working, they had freshly plastered the whole building, 
but I wasn't aware there was substructure damage where I painted Hidalgo's 
face," said Herron, noting that over the years the mural remained stripped of 
its powerful focal countenance -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Herron has been restoring "La Doliente de Hidalgo" (Hidalgo's 
Pain), a project he plans to complete Sept. 1, when the Los Angeles Festival 
opens. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be featured in its visual arts component after $3,000 for its 
restoration was contributed from the festival, $4,500 from "Neighborhood Pride: 
Great Walls Unlimited" (a mural program run by the Social and Public Arts 
Resource Center in Venice) and $3,000 from present owners of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"A huge part of the identity of Los Angeles, both as a community at large and 
within the art world, is the presense of these murals all over the city," 
festival director Peter Sellars said. "One of the most important artists in the 
whole mural movement is Willie." 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1976, the mural wraps around what is now a small market at City 
Terrace Drive and Miller Avenue in City Terrace. "It is a tribute to 'El Grito' 
(the scream), "the original cry for independence and liberty of the Mexican 
Indians against the rule of Spain," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
A mighty, white-haired Hidalgo, said to have shouted the freedom demand on 
Sept. 15, 1810, after clanging the bells of a village church, is depicted with 
his mouth agape, waving a flaming torch beside a crowd of rebellious followers 
echoing his call for action. A stylized Spanish soldier with bayonets for arms 
hovers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I used (David Alfaro) Siqueiros' mural of Hidalgo as a reference," said 
Herron, 38, who rose to prominence in the early 1970s with the "blood and guts 
and fists" style he uses to portray the barrio where he was raised and began 
drawing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Just three years out of high school, Herron was commissioned to paint the mural 
by Luis Duarte, who bought the pharmacy across the street from Herron's home. 
Duarte wanted to name the building after the Mexican priest. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'It will be called "Farmacia Hidalgo" and I'd like you to do a 
mural about Hidalgo and the struggle of Mexico against Spain,' " said Herron, 
who was paid $900 for the job. "After a couple of years, the mural faded very 
fast because $900 for a wall that size doesn't pay for the best kind of paint." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the work with a rainbow of durable acrylics isn't like painting by 
numbers. Some areas were so badly faded that restoration "verged on 
re-creation," he said, "because I had nothing to work with other than 
photographs that were taken right after the mural was completed." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti, the muralist's scourge, posed another challenge. Surprisingly, over 
the past 16 years, only 1% of the mural had been hit, said Herron, who has 
completed 14 other murals throughout Los Angeles, including one of 12 
commissioned in connection with the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The 160-foot-long artwork itself is still largely spray-paint free, but since 
the plastering and painting began, Herron said "local guys" have coated a 
three-foot-thick section of brick running along its base. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't mind. In 1988, the former co-founder of a '70s anti-Establishment 
performance collective named ASCO (Spanish for nausea) moved from the barrio to 
upscale Laguna Hills in Orange County. For most of 10 years, Herron had been 
working on graphic design in a commercial studio he co-owned, on interior 
murals for hotels and private homes and on paintings he's shown in Laguna Beach 
and San Diego galleries. 
</P>
<P>
But his feel for the grittier reality of his past, including the ability to 
cope in a community where he has sometimes had to dodge bullets between brush 
strokes, isn't lost. He plans to incorporate the graffiti into his mural rather 
than eradicate the urban iconography. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it's now been sort of resurrected or reawakened by its restoration, the 
mural has become a focal point in the community and (if) the local graffiti 
artists feel they need to put their 'John Hancock' on it so they can be noticed 
too, it's fine by me," Herron said. "Now I just have to figure out a creative 
way to make the two sort of marry each other."

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Celebration at the fairs - Business is booming at both
Grosvenor House and Olympia this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one is more surprised than the dealers. From Grosvenor House and Olympia
to the specialist Ceramics Fair at the Park Lane Hotel, the London art
market is humming. Last year, visitors to the Grosvenor House Art and
Antiques Fair idly inspected the odd item. But as the doors opened this
year, and those at the head of the queue purposefully strode in, it was
clear that business was about to be done.
It was clear, too, that the dealers were there to move their stock. Most
seem to have decided that they can no longer afford to use Grosvenor House
simply as a showcase. Gone are the Pounds 1m pictures, the Pounds 6m
sculpture, bravura displays of suites of powder blue and gilt Austrian
furniture. Truly exceptional works of art were relatively few, although
Angela von Wallwitz was rewarded by showing her spectacular Meissen wine
ewer in the form of a fantastical roaring beast. Modelled by JG Kirchner for
Augustus the Strong's Japanese Palace in Dresden around 1728 and over half a
metre high, this found a new home in the first two hours of the private
preview.
Most stands appealed to the middle of the market and recorded a high
turnover of less expensive items. Good 'brown' English furniture was, as
ever, the mainstay of the fair; Apter-Fredericks, for instance, sold half
his stand on preview day. The demand for jewels and precious objets d'art
appeared no less enthusiastic. By noon on the first day, New York-based A La
Vieille Russie had achieved sales exceeding the total of their business at
the 1993 fair and by the first weekend, silver dealers JH Bourdon-Smith had
sold 30 exhibits.
Much to the dismay of the Jeremiahs, the long-overdue abolition of dateline
restrictions this year did not alter the character of the fair. Instead it
treated us to Yves Mikaeloff's appropriately surreal display of the
petal-backed ebony armchairs that Sue and Marie created for a famous Paris
perfumery in 1923, and the traditional likes of the Phillip de Laszlo
portrait at the Christopher Wood Gallery. The most unexpected sight was the
bare buttocks and suspenders of an Allen Jones tucked in among the old and
modern masters at The Dover Street Gallery.
Far more dramatic was the transformation for the better of the appearance
and quality of experience at the fair. George Carter's elegant, understated
and unifying design gave the stands a more substantial feel (no more flimsy
partitions) and substantially higher ceilings. Even the air conditioning
seemed more efficient. The Grosvenor House Fair, which closes this Saturday
at 6pm, could not have hoped for a better Diamond Jubilee.
Over at Olympia, the Fine Art &amp; Antiques Fair could celebrate its 21st year
too. Long considered the poor relation of Grosvenor House, it has gone from
strength to strength, attracting ever more serious exhibits and visitors as
well as finding room for more off-beat collectables.
Here, too, furniture and silver enjoyed an exceptional year - some even
record sales. Silver dealers Marks Antiques, for example, sold a pair of
Paul Storr wine coolers for around Pounds 40,000, and two rare James I
goblets for the same sum. The fair drew a record 37,549 visitors - and
purchases out of the Metropolitan and Berlin Museums.
A similar tale was told at the International Ceramics Fair which got off to
a rip-roaring start on June 10. What was noticeable here, unlike Grosvenor
House, was that all the really good things seem to have sold, mostly on the
first day. English exhibits were far more interesting this year and the
quality of the French porcelain as good as ever. Crucially, prices were more
competitive too. It was the liveliest fixture in years.
Anyone doubting that it is still possible to find exceptional and relatively
inexpensive works of art on the market should make a pilgrimage to Agnew's
current show, Arte Sacra Antica (43 Old Bond Street, W1, until July 22). In
pride of place among this small but choice group of 14th and 15th century
panel paintings, illuminated manuscripts and maiolica hangs a 'lost'
crucifixion by Gentile da Fabriano, the leading Gothic painter in Italy. The
panel, its gold ground overpainted, had been sold at Phillips in 1991,
catalogued as workshop of Ugolino di Nerio, for Pounds 68,000.
The Crucifixion has been identified as the crowning panel of Gentile's
partially re-assembled 'Valle Romita' altarpiece of 1410-12 in the Brera
Gallery, Milan, where it was on display last year. Despairing of a sale, or
perhaps to force the Italians' hand, the painting is on offer in London at
Pounds 2.5m.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Connoisseurs come in from the cold - Speculators have
disappeared from the auction rooms as collectors return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The art and antiques trade continues to bump along in a repressed rather
than a depressed state. There is little action, but prices are certainly not
slipping down lower. The biggest quality fair of the year, Olympia in June,
did well, with a record attendance of over 37,500 and estimated sales in
excess of Pounds 21m. Dealers, major buyers at Olympia, are obviously now
optimistic enough to indulge, at last, in some re-stocking.
The first important event of the autumn season, the 20th Century British Art
Fair, was the most successful for four years, with over 1,000 works sold,
and there have been some strong auctions, most notably the country house
sales, where as usual buyers went berserk trying to secure a memento of the
Big House, however banal. Stokesay Court in Shropshire, promoted as a
Victorian time capsule, brought in Pounds 4.2m as against Sotheby's Pounds
2.5m estimate.
Routine sales in London in traditional areas, such as Old Masters, have
proved disappointing, but specialist auctions, such as Judge Bayne-Powell's
collection of miniatures, enjoyed strong collector bidding, with a 1645
miniature by Samuel Cooper selling for Pounds 89,500 as against a Pounds
25,000 top estimate.
It was a keen collector who paid the record price for a Dinky toy at
Christie's South Kensington, Pounds 12,650 for a 1930s delivery van bearing
the name of Bentall's. This is typical: speculators have completely
disappeared and traditional connoisseurs are sniffing the air again.
German art, especially the 20th century Expressionists, has ridden the
recession better than most. Christie's second annual auction in London in
this area brought in Pounds 7.7m and set artist records for Kirchner,
Corinth, Liebermann, and Jawlensky. But almost 30 per cent of the lots were
unsold, underlining the selectivity of buyers.
This weekend the pace picks up with the Kensington Antiques Fair, one of the
best established seasonal events, the draw at Kensington Town Hall while,
for the first time, the foyer of the Royal Festival Hall on South Bank acts
as home to the Contemporary Art Society Market. Every year anyone seriously
interested in contemporary art makes a point of visiting this show where
well-known artists (this year's crop includes Bridget Riley, Maggi Hambling,
Damien Hurst, Rachel Whiteread, and more) offer works priced between Pounds
100 and Pounds 2,000, with the CAS taking 30 per cent of the proceeds to
spend on buying art for galleries. On the first morning 150 items sold for
Pounds 80,000, but the work on the walls is constantly replaced.
Later this month, from November 16-22, the autumn Olympia starts. This fair
has quickly established itself as a popular event, with around 230 dealers,
many from the regions, taking space. Most exhibitors are offering a range of
antiques priced between Pounds 50 and Pounds 5,000, directed towards
Christmas shoppers.
The art market is acting as a faithful reflector of the economy - people are
becoming more prosperous, but are reluctant to spend. Earlier this year,
furniture sales benefited from the bonuses paid by certain City finance
houses, with young executives spending some of their windfalls on choice
Georgian and 19th century items, but 1994 has not been so prosperous in the
City. Until the house market improves substantially, the demand for general
decorative antiques will remain weak.
But at least the message is getting across that antiques make excellent
furnishings, of better craftsmanship than modern examples and likely to
hold, if not increase, in value. Sotheby's, which at one time was preparing
to stop selling low-priced items, is doing very well with its Colonnade
auctions, where few lots sell for more than Pounds 2,000. It brings new
young buyers into the auction rooms, the private buyers who have underpinned
the market in recent years.
Bonham's and Christie's, South Kensington, which specialise in this area,
showed the greatest expansion last season, and Phillips, the largest player
in this field with its network of regional auction rooms, also returned to
growth, with its busiest autumn in prospect for four years.
The problems at Lloyd's have made surprisingly little impact: there have
been fewer forced sales than anticipated, but those Lloyd's Names who
annually invested their bonuses in a painting or a Sheraton desk are notably
absent. Cork Street, home to many of London's leading dealers in modern and
contemporary art, was a traditional hunting ground for the culturally
inclined Names, and they have been much missed there.
But Cork Street has risen to the occasion by marketing itself more
energetically, and on November 26 and 27 there is the third annual Open
Weekend, with 19 galleries, from the mighty Waddingtons to the Atrium
Bookshop, open for business all day Saturday and Sunday, putting on a happy,
welcoming face.
One lesson the art and antiques trade has absorbed is that collectors are
not prepared to spend lavishly at the moment. Leading dealers are
concentrating on decorative works by popular artists, priced very
competitively. Old Bond Street dealer Frost &amp; Reed is preparing for
pre-Christmas buying with a December show offering a selection of works of
art all priced below Pounds 5,000.
Across the road, Agnew's has works by Whistler and Roussel, but prints
rather than paintings. The biggest London dealer, Richard Green, is
currently offering the ever popular Edward Seago while Colnaghi's has
temporarily abandoned Old Masters in favour of watercolours by Wefe Deliss.
Another established name, Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox is showing contemporary
portrait painters, including John Ward and John Sergeant, with an average
price of around Pounds 5,000.
Roy Miles has the leading contemporary Russian artist, Sergei Chepik, who
works in a traditional format, while Marlborough Graphics is offering new
etchings on the theme of nursery rhymes by Paula Rego.
Anyone wanting to see the cutting edge of contemporary art can visit the
Tate, where the short-listed artists for the Turner Prize are currently on
show, but in the main this is a time of retrenchment, of massaging back to
life nervous traditional buyers while hoping that enough of the new rich,
who are surely out there, will catch the collecting bug.
The art world has experienced so many false dawns of a market revival that
it has almost given up hope of a substantial upturn. It might have to settle
for a slowly appreciating trade, built on connoisseurs rather than
speculators, and less inclined to be seduced by a trend. It makes for a less
profitable business but a more firmly based one.

<HL> Fine Art Is Now on Exhibit in Many Ads --- But Critics Say Commercial Use Cheapens the Great Masterpieces </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ronald Alsop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   When Edouard Manet unveiled his "Luncheon on the Grass" in 1863, many Parisians were scandalized by the depiction of a nude woman picnicking with two fully dressed men. 

   Times change. 
Today, the painting is being used to sell grocery products and charge cards. 

   "Luncheon on the Grass" turned up in all its glory last year in magazine advertisements for both Rice-a-Roni Savory Classics and the American Express Card. 
"Before Savory Classics, people went to extremes to make meals interesting," quipped the Rice-a-Roni ad. 

   To some art connoisseurs, the ads were demeaning to Manet. 
But at least the French painter is in good company. 
Lately, advertisers have developed an appreciation for fine art: They are using works by Gauguin, Monet, Raphael and many other painters to promote everything from men's cologne to candy bars to bathroom toilets. 

   The burgeoning use of fine art in ads is hotly debated among museum officials, some of whom worry about cheapening the world's greatest masterpieces. 
The National Gallery of Art, in Washington, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts are among museums that refuse to deal with advertisers -- although that doesn't always prevent marketers from using their paintings. 
At the other extreme are museums that freely license art to ad agencies to help balance their budgets. 

   "Advertisers have become much more interested in our art works, and we study their requests on a case-by-case basis," says Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
"Unfortunately, some proposed uses are flip and disrespectful." 

   Museum executives most resent advertisers who alter paintings, usually by inserting their products into the picture. 
In a Hershey commercial, a van Gogh self-portrait and a ballerina in a Degas painting are shown holding candy bars. 
American Express Co. inserted a charge-card receipt into the hands of a woman in Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." 
And for an ad promoting a chunky variety of spaghetti sauce, Prince Co. commissioned a drawing of a chubby Mona Lisa. 

   "Seurat's 'Sunday Afternoon' and Grant Wood's 'American Gothic' have been corrupted in ads so often they've lost their integrity," says Cisley Celmer, an official at the Milwaukee Art Museum. 

   But the Art Institute of Chicago, which owns both works, doesn't object to the parodies. 
"I think the send-ups of our paintings are a riot," says Lyn DelliQuadri, the museum's director of graphics and reproductions. 
The money is nice, too. 
She says the Art Institute rents transparencies of its works to advertisers for fees of $250 to $1,000. 

   For advertisers, art is a way to create an image of quality or luxury for their products. 
Famous paintings lend a touch of class to a brand name, whether it's Doral Saturnia spa in Miami (which uses Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"), Fancy Feast cat food (Goya's "Don Manuel Osorio de Zuniga") or Sharp office copiers (Raphael's "Portrait of Maddalena Doni"). 

   "Even if you can't afford the best of everything, you can afford the best of one thing," proclaims an ad for Red Devil paint that features a Degas painting. 
In ads headlined "Evolution of the Species," Jaguar Cars Inc. places its autos in lush jungle landscapes evocative of Henri Rousseau. 

   "Putting a product with a masterpiece says more about its quality than any words can express," says Jim Tennant, a creative director at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, which created an ad for Porcher bathroom fixtures that featured a work by Henri Matisse. 

   Museum officials and art historians say advertisers' use of classic paintings is a sign that fine art has become a more central part of American culture. 
"The growing popularity of art-history courses in colleges and blockbuster art exhibitions has given the advertising world a new pool of sophisticated imagery on which to draw," says Robert Baldwin, an art historian at Connecticut College. 

   Last spring, the Lintas ad agency in London reacted swiftly to the $39.9 million sale of one of van Gogh's sunflower paintings. 
Within a few days, it commissioned an artist to copy the van Gogh work -- with a tub of Unilever's Flora margarine alongside the vase of sunflowers. 
The ad's tag line: "Very tasty if you've got the bread." 

   Advertisers these days also are trading increasingly on the cultural appeal of classical music and literature. 
A spot for Honda's Accord features a work by Chopin, and opera music is part of ads for wine, fancy perfumes and even laundry detergent. 

   Recently, TV viewers also have heard actress Elizabeth Taylor reciting passages from William Shakespeare and John Dryden in commercials for her Passion perfume. 
And print ads for the Sterling car include poetry by Robert Louis Stevenson, William Wordsworth and Andrew Marvell. 

   But advertisers are making even more use of the world's premier art -- though doing so isn't always easy. 
When marketers want to use a work by a living artist, they merely consult him for permission. 
For a deceased artist whose works aren't yet in the public domain -- generally, one who has been dead for less than 50 years -- advertisers usually must turn to the artist's heirs. 

   "We take into account the propriety of an ad and the amount of the fee to be paid, but rejections occur pretty frequently," says Theodore Feder, president of New York-based Artists Rights Society, which represents museums, artists and their heirs. 
One such rejection occurred when a company wanted to use a Jackson Pollock painting to illustrate the activity of a dental-care product. 

   An artist's heirs often raise objections if a work is put to a use they haven't approved. 
Recently, a dispute erupted over a magazine ad for Porcher toilets, sinks and bidets that includes a reproduction of Matisse's "Large Reclining Nude." 
Artists Rights Society, representing the estate of Matisse, who died in 1954, has complained about the use of the painting to Porcher and its ad agency, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding. 
Officials of the Baltimore Museum of Art, which owns the work, are also quite perturbed. 

   "It was a slur on Matisse," says Nancy Press, the Baltimore museum's coordinator of rights and reproductions. 
"I don't agree with the premise that you can use anything to sell anything. 
We walk a straight line when it comes to the integrity of art." 

   Foote Cone executives say they believed the work was in the public domain and free for the agency to use. 
"Even though it was a toilet, the painting was appropriate because it's a French toilet that's beautifully crafted," says Mr. Tennant, the creative director at Foote Cone. 
"The toilet's wonderful lines, shapes and colors were a natural parallel with Matisse's work." 
Mr. Tennant says the agency is negotiating a settlement with the Matisse estate. 

   Control of paintings in the public domain -- which include impressionist, post-impressionist and most other works that advertisers want to reproduce -- generally falls to the museums that hold them. 
Although the museums normally don't have any copyright claims to such works, they do control the color transparencies that provide much higher-quality reproduction than would a post card or photograph in an art book. 
Because good reproduction is so important in advertising, agencies typically won't use a certain painting unless they can get the transparencies. 

   Richard Tooke, supervisor of rights and reproductions at New York's Museum of Modern Art, won't release his transparencies to advertisers. 
"We're the keepers of works of art," he explains, "and feel it would be presumptuous of us to decide whether an artist would want his paintings commercialized." 

   Even so, Mr. Tooke concedes, some advertisers reproduce his museum's paintings, whether from post cards, books or other sources. 
For example, he says, a furniture-company ad features "The Sleeping Gypsy," by Rousseau, which hangs in the Museum of Modern Art. 
"But there's really nothing we can do about that legally," he says. 

   For their part, ad agency creative directors believe many museums are overly protective of their works. 
Advertisers contend that they are serving an educational purpose by exposing more people to fine art through their ads. 

   As for tampering with some paintings for comic effect, they believe that it's harmless and that many of the artists probably would have been amused, even flattered. 
Indeed, some famous artists dabbled in commercial work themselves. 
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec designed posters for cabarets in Paris and for makers of furniture, printing ink and bicycle chains. 
More recently, Andy Warhol created an ad for Absolut vodka. 

   "I don't believe classic images in art are sacred," says Laurie Solomon, associate creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the ad agency that stuck Hershey bars in famous paintings. 
"Paintings are part of the culture and are meant to be enjoyed."

<HEAD>Religious Group Ends Boycott of Clorox Products</HEAD>

   A religious group has ended a nine-month
boycott of Clorox Co. products, citing a marked reduction in the
company's sponsorship of ``sex, violence, profanity and
anti-Christian stereotyping'' on television.
   But the boycott ``was a success in both dropping the sales of
Clorox products and in encouraging Clorox to enforce their
advertising policy,'' said Billy Melvin, executive director of
National Association of Evangelicals and chairman of the group
known as Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV.
   Without disclosing whether the boycott cut into sales, Clorox
communications director Fred Reicher said, ``certainly we are
gratified the boycott has been lifted. The boycott made us aware
that implementation of our standards were flawed and we tightened
those.''
   CLeaR-TV describes itself as a coalition of 1,600 Christian
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people.
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a United Methodist preacher who
founded the group and serves as its executive director, said the
organization would continue a one-year boycott of products made by
the Mennen Co., also accused of sponsoring what the group sees as
objectionable television programming.
   When the boycotts were announced nine months ago, CLeaR-TV said
it had found the two manufacturers had placed advertisements on
offensive television programs from April 27 through May 24, a
``sweeps'' period during which the popularity of network
programming is gauged.
   Programs considered particularly offensive during that period _
both carrying advertising by the targeted companies _ included
NBC-TV's ``Miami Vice'' and ``Dream Street,'' Melvin had said.
   CLeaR-TV said it found a reduction of almost two-thirds in the
amount of sex, violence and profanity sponsored by Clorox last fall
as compared with last spring.
   The group said it had been approached by Clorox officials in
February noting that standards had been tightened and requesting
that the boycott be lifted.
   Clorox, whose products include bleach, Act laundry detergent,
Formula 409 cleaner and Lucite paint, ranked 66th among the leading
national advertising spenders at $148 million in 1988, according to
the trade publication Advertising Age.

LATINO ART EXHIBITION A COLORFUL MILESTONE; ARTIST CHIDES MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Latino art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a landmark 
event. The show, on national tour, is the largest art exhibition of U.S. 
Latinos ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition did not happen by accident," said Howard Fox, the museum's 
curator of contemporary art. "This exhibition is an idea whose time is here." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one prominent artist complains that the museum's attention to 
Latino art is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum has demonstrated a lack of genuine interest and support for the 
Hispanic artistic community," said Carlos Almaraz, whose work is part of the 
exhibit. He pointed out that the last major Latino art exhibition there was 15 
years ago, when the museum featured "Los Four" -- local Chicano painters 
Almaraz, Frank Romero, Gilbert Lujan and Roberto de la Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
So while a large crowd toasted the exhibition on opening night, Almaraz 
boycotted the gala. "Why go to the opening?" Almaraz asked. "To say what great 
things it (the museum) has done for Hispanics? No!" 
</P>
<P>
However, he commended Jane Livingston and John Beardsley, who organized the 
show for Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. The two, curators of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art in Washington, were "instrumental and supportive for the 
creation of this exhibition. They had the critical eyes to look at art and not 
at the politics." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, "Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary 
Painters and Sculptors," continues until April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The art in the exhibition is gripping. It is vivid. It is powerful and real. 
With exuberant colors, the paintings seem to scream from the walls. The exhibit 
covers the spectrum from the photorealist narrative to the abstract. Although 
its roots are in the past, it is unapologetically contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a richness in this exhibition that defies categorization. Every 
artist shown here is an artist of merit. This is a robust, diverse, impassioned 
exhibition," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exhibition of American and Latino art in a slightly different 
language," Beardsley said. "It is a language of forms and contents that 
portrays the Latino experience in the United States. Its strength consists in 
that it is both American and Latino art. 
</P>
<P>
"Something in the tension between the so-called dominant culture and the other 
contributes to the strength in the work," Beardsley said. "The hybridization in 
the language is one of the real strengths. Tension between cultures generates 
power in the artistic expression that emerges from it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing consensus that art does not have to be created by "the 
in-crowd" in New York City to be acceptable. Los Angeles artist Romero, whose 
painting "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard" is in the exhibit, says, 
"Corporate America is very insecure with images. I'm breaking into corporate 
collections with narrative pieces that tell a story, which makes the art 
controversial. In this way, the mainstream is coming to Hispanic art, and not 
the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of this exhibition, however, Fox said, "There is no way to 
identify a mainstream within the art world, any more than it is possible to 
identify a mainstream culture." 
</P>
<P>
Gronk, a Los Angeles Chicano artist who uses only one name, said, "Chicano art 
is part of the American culture, and it goes unrecognized in the United States. 
I'm out to break the stereotypes of what it is that we Latinos are supposed to 
be like. In its diversity, this exhibition communicates that visually. 
</P>
<P>
"A contemporary plastic artist is a visual philosopher for our time," added the 
artist, whose works are part of the exhibition. "This show is a success because 
it brought this point to the attention of a lot of people in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Another artist, Texas-born Carmen Lomas Garza, considers herself a curandera, a 
healer. "I want to depict in a fine art form all those aspects of my culture 
that are positive and important for others to see and gain an understanding of 
who I am as a Chicano artist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Through one of her paintings, the "Curandera," she attempts to convey a special 
message. "In South Texas, we'd all go to medical doctors to get prescriptions 
for drugs. But we'd go to the curandera for the final cleansing. It is a 
spiritual cleansing. A healing. 
</P>
<P>
"Artistically, I have tried to heal myself and other Chicanos and Latinos from 
the damage that was done to us in the form of discrimination and oppression," 
she said. "I continue the tradition of making home altars honoring the Day of 
the Dead. I paint scenes depicting family customs. My art work shows the 
dignity of my humanness." 
</P>
<P>
The 145 paintings, sculptures and assemblages in the exhibition portray 
survival, anxiety and hope; confusion, identity, anger and love. These are all 
expressions of deep-seated feelings, convictions, struggles and emotions that 
reflect Latino life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Diversity is also present in the materials and techniques employed by these 
artists. Among the artists, John Valadez, a Chicano muralist and a colorful 
urban painter, displays "La Butterfly," a realistic reflection of Chicano 
street scenes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez's oil paintings draw from landscape imagery of her native 
Colombia. Felix Lopez and Luis Tapia, both from the Southwest, make brightly 
colored religious wood carvings known traditionally as santos. Gregorio Marzan 
of Puerto Rico constructs mixed-media animal figures in vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Jimenez of El Paso works on painted animal sculptures and human figures on 
painted fiberglass. Californian Manuel Neri's sculptures involve the human 
figure with rough surfaces. Robert Graham, who was born in Mexico City and is 
best known for his 1984 Olympic bronze statues, stands out as the most 
realistic sculptor of this group. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that strikes the attention of a viewer at the entrance to the 
show is Lujan's elaborately decorated 1950 Chevy. Lujan two-door sedan features 
a "flaming jalapeno paint job" in the front and a Chicano couple along the 
side. "Our Family Car," Lujan said, is symbolic of "the social dynamics, an 
entire culture built around cars." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artists believe that this tour will be looked upon as a turning 
point of art in the United States. In the future, Gronk said, "labels, such as 
Hispanic, will fall on the wayside. People will see that this is American art."

   NEW YORK -- Works by name artists sold for 25% off at
Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s major fall sale of contemporary art
last night.
   More than three-quarters of the paintings and sculpture
found buyers, making this sale the most successful major sale
of the two-week auction season, which ends today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But about half the works sold at a fraction of the presale
price estimates, including works by Ellsworth Kelly, Brice
Marden and Philip Guston. Sotheby's expected the total sale
to fetch about $32 million to $40 million. Instead, $24.4
million of art sold in the lengthy sale. Of the 82 paintings
and sculpture brought to the auction block, 20 failed to
sell.
   Eli Broad, head of insurer and financial services firm
Broad Inc., purchased a Roy Lichtenstein for $935,000. The
piece, "Non Objective One," an homage to artist Piet
Mondrian, was expected to sell for $1.2 million to $1.6
million. Mr. Broad said he believed the painting would have
brought $3 million at the height of the art market boom about
two years ago.
   German collectors were active at the sale, said Diana D.
Brooks, president of Sotheby's North and South American
auction operations. Bidding was aggressive for minimalist
sculptures and for works by Georg Baselitz, a leading German
expressionist painter.
   Mrs. Brooks said the firm was "extremely pleased" with the
results. Now, "we have a good sense of what price levels
artists should be estimated at in the future."
   "Jubillee," a Jasper Johns collage featuring the names of
colors stenciled on fabric painted shades of gray, met
expectations by bringing in $5 million. Considered by some
art dealers to be the most important work for sale this
auction season, it had a presale estimate of $4 million to $5
million.
   The painting featured by Sotheby's catalog was Robert
Rauschenberg's "Small Red Painting," a "combine" painting of
a red umbrella plastered with paint, postcards, comic strips
and topped by a lightbulb. It was expected to fetch $1.8
million to $2.2 million, but failed to sell at auction and
was sold privately for $1.3 million to art dealer William
Acquavella.
   A familiar face back on the auction block was Andy
Warhol's "Red Jackie." Hammered down at Sotheby's just two
years ago for $825,000, it was back on the block by order of
a creditor. This time, it sold for $352,000, including a 10%
premium paid to Sotheby's, against a presale price estimate
of $300,000 to $350,000.

<LEADPARA>  Q I have a home with finished aluminum soffits, fascias, gutters and window
trim. I would like to paint these a different color. Is this possible? And, if
so, will I be repainting every four years and lose out on the benefits of
aluminum trim?;    A Not to worry. PPG Industries has a latex paint
specifically formulated for repainting prefinished aluminum siding and trim.
It's called Metal Siding Refinish, and comes in a variety of colors to match
current popular siding colors. If the surface is prepared correctly and the
paint properly applied, it will last for about 10 years. This compares
favorably with many older types of prefinished aluminum siding which required
painting after about 10 years. The product can also be used on unfinished
aluminum after applying a primer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q I would like to install a strip oak tongue-and-groove floor on top of an
above-grade concrete slab. However, I've heard horror stories of costly wood
floors buckling from moisture. How can I avoid problems caused by moisture
that might accumulate in the area under the slab?;    A A hardwood floor can
be installed on a concrete slab at or above grade. The Oak Flooring Institute
recommends against below-grade installations.;    Moisture is the chief
culprit in hardwood floor buckling, so test the slab for dryness. Tape one
square foot of clear polyethylene sheet to the slab, sealing its edges with
plastic tape. If after 24 hours, no clouding or moisture droplets have formed
under it, the slab is dry enough to install a wood floor.;    To prevent
moisture from reaching the underside of the hardwood floor, place a vapor
barrier of either building felt or polyethylene plastic over the slab prior to
installation.;    Q The outside of my home is covered with wood-grain aluminum
siding. In a few areas, the bottom edges of the siding have developed a white
chalklike substance. What is it, can I prevent it from spreading and how do I
remove it?;    A The chalky substance is a layer of dead paint pigments along
the bottom edges of the siding. It is not aluminum corrosion. Over time, the
siding's paint weathers, developing a dead pigment layer on the surface.
Particles of dead paint are washed off by rain and accumulate along the
siding's bottom edges.;    Wash the siding periodically with a solution of
1/3-cup detergent, 2/3-cup triphosphate (such as Soilax), 1 quart Clorox and 3
quarts of warm water.;    Since the baked-on paint systems used on aluminum
siding are somewhat similar to automotive finishes, dull finishes exposed to
severe weathering can be protected with an automotive wax.  </TEXT>

   A 19th-century painting set in ancient Rome of a
young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $153,450 _
nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $8.
   ``It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but
that isn't unique in art,'' said Sotheby's Simon Taylor after the
sale Tuesday of ``Diadumene'' by Sir Edward Poynter.
   The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for
once-neglected Victorian works. It had estimated the painting would
fetch up to $232,500.
   Poynter, in 1885, had painted the young woman nude but he added
diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the Royal Academy of
Arts and provoked letters from shocked viewers.
   One letter to the press, signed ``British Matron,'' said the
writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition.
Another letter said the painting would produce a ``burning sense of
shame'' in any ``modest woman on the arm of father, brother or
lover.''
   Poynter was known for such paintings but his most famous work,
reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day, was ``Faithful unto
Death.'' It depicted a Roman sentry staying at his post during the
destruction of Pompeii by the Vesuvius volcano.
   The seller and buyer of ``Diadumene'' were not identified.
   The painting had been auctioned in 1956 at a sale of the contents
of Ashley Manor, owned by Lady Agnes Chichester Dixon-Hartland.
   Top price at Tuesday's auction of 19th century European art was
$2.3 million _ more than double the estimate _ paid anonymously for
``Grandfather's Birthday,'' a family fireside scene by Austrian
artist Ferdinand Georg Waldmueller. It was a record for his work.

   Christie's auction house held its first-ever sale
of Spanish paintings on Friday, and a lighthearted ``picture within
a picture'' fetched the highest individual price of $233,000.
   The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total
of $2.1 million, with prices ``well beyond expectations,'' said a
Christie's statement.
   The most expensive work, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta's ``En El
Estudio'' (In the Studio), ``reverses the role of portraiture,''
Christie's said.
   It depicts one of the artist's favorite models dressed in a
sweeping, salmon-colored gown, standing in front of her own
unfinished portrait and drawing a caricature of the artist on the
canvas.
   The painting's price of $233,000 was $56,000 more than its
highest estimate, Christie's said. The auction house did not provide
the year of the painting. The artist lived from 1841 to 1920.
   The highest price paid for a religious painting was $214,000 for
a sumptuous depiction of a candlelight ceremony honoring a saint,
titled ``Celebrating Santa Maria Della Rosa.''
   The artist, Jose Benlliure y Gil, lived from 1855 to 1914.

   More than 750 objects never intended for a museum gallery are
being displayed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis as part of
the ``Graphic Design in America'' show that opened Nov. 5 and will
travel to New York, Phoenix and London after its debut.
   The magazines, newspapers and maps; banners, buttons and flags;
film and television clips; posters, signs and symbols; and trinkets
from Andrew Jackson's presidential campaign, the 1939 World's Fair
and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were designed to make a quick
impact before being discarded.
   ``Graphic design deals with information that's not meant to be
preserved forever, except if it's in books,'' said Walker design
curator Mildred Friedman, who organized the show.
   ``There hadn't been a big museum show of graphic design before
this, and now that I've done it, I understand why. So much is gone.
It disappears like the winds.''
   Once traffic signs, billboards, advertisements, posters, postage
stamps, record jackets, film and television titles have served
their purpose, they are dumped in the trash. Nevertheless, graphic
design is the world's most pervasive art form, shaping the visual
environment of the world.
   ``Graphic Design in America'' is divided into three thematic
sections _ design in the urban environment, including everything
from maps and trademarks to the World's Fair and Olympics;
mass-media design, ranging from newspapers and magazines to books
and film graphics; and design for government and commerce.
   The show, which includes design developments since 1829 in items
on loan from nearly 100 individuals and institutions, will remain
on view in Minneapolis through Jan. 21.
   Here is a list of other shows at some museums and galleries in

Jerald Silva's masterfully painted watercolor nudes are caught somewhere 
between Ingres' psychological portraits and strictly formal figure studies 
toying with light, form and technique. Confusion arises because the female 
figures are so often bland individuals at the mercy of the artist's technical 
display. Yet occasionally they survive the assault with dogged inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
This intensity enlivens the somewhat languid action in paintings like "Woman 
Rising," where a seated nude, gazing determinedly straight ahead, is pictured 
about to push off from a red chair directly at the viewer. Behind her on a 
steam-fogged picture window are wet, drippy finger marks that catch her 
willpower and radiate like an expressionistic halo. 
</P>
<P>
Silva's dexterity with the figure and his ability to make watercolor steam drip 
is wonderful. Loose, but accurate he can make color imitate just about any 
light effect. Yet it's only when he stops fiddling with all the gee-whiz 
effects and settles in to say something that the paintings really come to life. 
His steamy "Olympia" is a wonderful visual pun on sexuality. Most moving is a 
cunning and unsympathetic self-portrait. (Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, 
to Oct. 21.) SUVAN GEER

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Magnificent Titian, and other titans - Patricia
Morison is enchanted by a masterful exhibition of Venice's Golden Age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had
died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote,
'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice,
even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have
reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance
as supreme painter of Venice. And so began truly The Century of Titian, the
title of the magnificent exhibition which can be seen in Paris and nowhere
else.
It would be rash to prophesy that decades must elapse before there is
another comparable exhibition of Venice's Golden Age. Nonetheless, it is
certain that this exhibition had remarkable leverage in securing loans,
thanks to the prestige of its organiser, Michel Laclotte. For this last
exhibition before his retirement, the director of the Louvre has been
calling in the favours, winkling out important paintings which have not been
lent for over a generation, and in some cases have barely been seen this
century.
Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's
golden age, among them some of the best-loved paintings of the Italian
Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her
Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it
is his show alone.
The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983-4 produced not one
Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle. In contrast, Paris
offers an entire room hung with 17 Giorgiones, among them the mysterious
'Sunset Landscape' from London and the exquisite Laura, bare-breasted in a
fur-lined coat - a courtesan, a Virtue, or even, as some would have it, a
marriage portrait. As for the bitterly lamenting old woman, 'La Vecchia,' it
seems odd that anyone could think this is Giorgione's portrait of his
mother. However, the enormous catalogue (FFr390, Pounds 47.15) reveals that
this is the opinion of the Italian scholar, A. Ballarin, on whose views of
Giorgione and Titian the exhibition is more or less closely based.
But then, Giorgione is an endlessly mysterious artist. Hanging such a room
amounts to throwing down the gauntlet a dozen times - assuming that certain
paintings such as the San Diego 'Portrait of a Man,' with its immensely
delicate sfumato effect, are certainly by him. But whoever one plumps for,
there is no gainsaying the extraordinarily powerful effect of a wall of five
portraits of beautiful, narcissistic, moody young men, among them the famous
Gattemalata from the Uffizi and the hand-on-heart youth from the National
Gallery in Budapest.
The rooms which follow trace the influence of Giorgione, above all on
Sebastiano del Piombo and on young Titian. The hornets of controversy buzz
loudest of all at the point where the famous 'Concert Champetre' from the
Louvre is said to be by Titian, and the 'Susannah and Daniel' from Glasgow.
The unique pleasure of any such exhibition is to see wonderful paintings
hanging together, commenting on each other. The 'Concert' and the 'Susanna'
look less like Titian, to my eye, for being shown alongside the newly
cleaned sacra conversazione from Mamiano di Traversatolo. Here is the artist
of the Frari Assumption, totally confident in his harmonious grouping of
monumental figures, and gifted above all with the surpassing use of colour.
Separate sections on middle and late Titian include such rarities as a
portrait of Laura Dianti, Alfonso d'Este's mistress, and 'St Margaret,'
stepping out of the dragon's jaws while behind her is the view of a burning
city as brilliantly impressionistic as anything from late Titian's brush.
Interspersed are copious selections of other artists of the Veneto who fell
under (or in Lotto's case, rejected), the spell of Giorgione and Titian.
The Louvre has lent much, including the 'Man with a Glove'. Its 'Venus of
the Pardo' can be seen with the two triumphantly erotic mythologies from the
Prado, 'Danae' and 'Venus with Cupid and and Organist'. In all there are 150
paintings, and two rooms of 120 exceptionally fine prints and drawings.
Le Siecle de Titien is attracting some 4,000 visitors daily so you should
expect a queue. However, the show is spaciously hung which means that the
crowd soon thins out. Wastage is helped by the fact that there are
disgracefully few seats. This may be a mundane point, but it is nonetheless
a serious one.
Increasingly, doubts are expressed about the wisdom of exposing works of art
to the risks of travel. In the last analysis, then, the justification for
blockbuster exhibitions has to be the joy they give the public. So why, one
might ask, are curators the world over so indifferent to their visitors'
comfort? Le Siecle de Titian is, I am afraid, a classic example.
The labels are so small that opera glasses are a good idea. And if possible,
plan to visit more than once - not that there is a season ticket option,
which also seems ungenerous. At the least, husband your strength, for the
final room of the exhibition deserves not to be skimped. Hung against a
nasty royal blue background, are the unsettling works of four great painters
in their old age. Of Veronese there is the tender, quiet-toned 'St Pantaleon
curing a Child' and 'Christ in the Garden of Olives'. Counter-Reformation
spirituality speaks with a more troubling voice in the nocturnal scenes by
Tintoretto and Bassano. Among the masterpieces of Titian's final two decades
are 'Venus and Adonis' from the Metropolitan, the newly restored 'Venus
Bandaging the Eyes of Cupid,' the Detroit 'Ecce Homo,' and 'St Jerome' from
the Escorial.
Above all, there is 'The Flaying of Marsyas,' the painting which in a decade
of travel around the world has awakened a deep response in art lovers, few
of whom would ever see it at home in Kromeric in the Czech Republic. Surely,
then, it should have been possible to provide a perch?
Prestigious block-buster shows look set to continue despite the opposition
of hard-line conservationists. Indeed, their arguments look mean-spirited in
the face of an exhibition like this, which offers such a deep and rich
encounter with one of the most exciting periods in western art. And yet, at
the same time, it also underlines the need for curators to take a less
Olympian attitude to their eager but footsore public.
Exhibition ends 14 June; open daily (except Tuesdays), 10-8, Thursdays
10-10. Sponsored by ICI France.

<HEAD>Picasso Painting Brings Record Price For 20th Century Art</HEAD>

   A private Latin American collector paid nearly
$25 million at auction for an early Pablo Picasso painting of a
mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th
century work of art.
   ``Maternity,'' from the artist's blue period, sold Monday at
Christie's for twice its estimate, making it the third-highest price
ever paid for a work of art, behind Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
and ``Sunflowers.''
   The 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 post-Impressionist and
modern works on sale from the collection of William Goetz, a
Hollywood motion picture executive, and his wife Edith, the daughter
of film mogul, Louis B. Mayer.
   The 28 lots, all of which sold, fetched $85,024,500 _ a record
for a single owner's sale at auction.
   ``This may well be the sale of the century,'' said Christie's
president Christopher J. Burge, who presided over the auction.
   ``Tonight's auction was ripe for success _ unsurpassingly
beautiful works of art, a fiercely competitive market, and a
renowned provenance,'' he said.
   Earlier, Burge had predicted that the sale would fetch about $50
million.
   The Goetzes built their collection _ generally considered one of
the best of its kind _ during the 1940s and 1950s. Until this
summer, their paintings hung in their Holmby Hills mansion in
California, where the couple once entertained lavishly. He died in
1969; she died in June at the age of 82.
   After intense bidding, ``Maternity'' sold to an unidentified
Latin American collector, whose winning bid was placed by telephone.
The painting was expected to sell for $10 million.
   It depicts a blue-robed mother in a high-backed chair, with a
scissors and sewing basket at her feet. The child, standing next to
her, has a ball in his hands.
   The auction house described the painting as a ``majestic, tender
but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love.''
   ``It's a great, very rare picture,'' Burge said. ``It was a
unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture'' of
Picasso's, who painted it when he was 20, he added.
   When Burge brought the hammer down on the $24.75 million bid, the
crowd broke into applause.
   ``Irises'' sold for $53.9 million in November 1987. A few months
earlier, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million.
   The second-highest priced work sold at Monday's auction was
Claude Monet's ``The Beach at Trouville,'' an 1870 oil on canvas,
which went for $10.78 million.
   The third-highest priced piece was Edgar Degas' ``Little Dancer
At 14 Years,'' a statue that sold for $10,175,000, a new record for
the artist. The statue depicts a dancer in polychromed bronze; she
wears a muslin skirt and her hair is tied with a satin ribbon.
   Eight artist's records were set during the auction; they were for
Picasso, Degas, Pierre Bonnard, Henri Fantin-Latour, Marie
Laurencin, Alfred Sisley, Chaim Soutine and Edouard Vuillard.
   All prices include a 10 percent commission paid by the buyer to
the auction house.

<HL> Los Angeles's Latest Cultural Innovation;
Showing and Selling Art in Restaurants

   Bruce Corwin, president of Metropolitan Theaters Corp., and his wife, Toni, were lunching on walnut and chicken salad at Trumps, a trendy restaurant here, when Mr. Corwin looked up at the wall behind his wife and saw a piece of art he instantly liked. 

   "Wouldn't that be a great birthday present for you?" 
Mr. Corwin asked his wife. 
She agreed. 
But since the turquoise cement-and-glass relief already had been sold to another diner, the Corwins were directed to the studio of artist Laddie John Dill, where they paid $7,000 for another abstract work they liked even better. 

   Like Trumps, many chic restaurants around Los Angeles are becoming quasi-art galleries, both showing and selling paintings and sculptures. 
And artists, though they express some reservations about the practice, are embracing it. 

   The trend reflects surging interest in art in a city where gallery-hopping is difficult, because galleries are scattered over vast distances. 
It also reflects Angelenos' enthusiasm for dining out. 

   "People here don't have time to go to both restaurants and galleries," says Melisa Nicola, an owner of L.A. Nicola restaurant. 
"So they wind up going where their stomachs take them, and they buy art from restaurants." 
And since many of the restaurants that pioneered the changing art shows are among the city's most successful dining spots, they are being emulated by many new restaurants. 

   Typically, artists loan their works to restaurants through an art dealer in exchange for public exposure and possible sales. 
Restaurants, in turn, receive a steady stream of changing art shows for their walls, and some receive commissions on sales. 
Most exhibitions run two to four weeks and are ushered in by crowded opening parties that promote both the artist and the restaurant. 

   "It's an everybody-wins situation," says Marcia Weisman, a trustee of the city's Museum of Contemporary Art and a collector who bought a work at Trumps. 

   Indeed, artists are approaching restaurants with a zeal formerly reserved for galleries. 
Janet Karatz, the art consultant for Trumps, says she receives 30 packets of slides a week from artists hoping for shows at the restaurant. 

   Such interest among artists means that some restaurant art curators can afford to be almost as choosy in their selection processes as are gallery owners. 
Bruce Marder, owner of the West Beach Cafe, one of the first restaurants to host art shows, says he turns down a lot of young artists. 
"Basically, we try to deal with artists who already have gallery shows and are well represented," he says. 

   But some artists see drawbacks in restaurant shows. 
Mr. Dill, an established Los Angeles artist who has shown his work at two restaurants in addition to a major gallery, says restaurant viewers aren't the most alert group. 
"It's a passive way to look at art," Mr. Dill says. 
"It shouldn't replace the commitment to go out and see (art in) galleries." 

   The art in restaurants isn't always well displayed or lighted, artists say. 
Roy Fowler, a painter who usually shows his work at the Anne Plumb Gallery in New York, had his first restaurant show at the West Beach Cafe last summer. 
The opening drew more than 100 guests. 
"It was a lot of fun, and it was good exposure," Mr. Fowler says. 
"The only problem was that the maitre d' turned down the dimmer switch and it was dark." 

   Some restaurateurs who have acquired art for permanent display take a dim view of restaurant shows. 
"Great art is in great homes, great private collections or great galleries," says Peter Morton, the owner of celebrity-filled Mortons restaurant. 
"No great artist is going to get involved in a great show in a restaurant." 
Mortons owns works by established artists like Francis Bacon and David Hockney, but the art isn't for sale. 

   Michael McCarty, the owner of Michael's, another top-tier restaurant, has an $850,000 collection of art for permanent display, including works by Jasper Johns and Frank Stella. 
"Having someone come and change the art every couple of days is fine and dandy, but it's not the same statement," he says. 
"My collection requires a lot of money and taste and time." 

   Still, some restaurants, like the West Beach Cafe, have gained a reputation for showing, and offering for sale, the works of prominent artists like David Salle and Cindy Sherman. 

   Many restaurant owners, seeking not to offend their diners, limit the kinds of works in their shows. 
"If it's too dark and too crazy, I wouldn't use it," says Michel Richard, owner of Citrus, a popular restaurant that opened in January. 
Noel Decker, a managing director of Wave Restaurant &amp; Bar, says of his art selection: "No violence. 
No nudes. 
Just tasteful. 
We try to keep it light." 

   Some diners appear easily unnerved. 
Wave displayed a painting by artist Joe Davis that depicted a large man in jeans and a tank top swinging a mallet. 
"Customers said it was too physical for the restaurant, so it went back to the gallery," says Mr. Decker. 
At Restaurant Muse, a large painting by Kraig Cavanaugh of a hefty nude woman, titled "Object of Desire," has drawn criticism such as, "Oh, my goodness! 
How disgusting!" says Jane Poole, Muse's assistant manager. 

   But the West Beach Cafe, an artists' hangout, doesn't restrict itself to works that are tame or primarily decorative. 
"We've shown things that people thought were an assault to the dining experience," says Fred Hoffman, an art curator for the cafe and an owner of the HoffmanBormanGallery. 
For example, the cafe showed a painting by Georganne Deen depicting a decapitation. 

   Cigarette smoke, grease and even flying food put some of the art at risk. 
Michael's Mr. McCarty says "a big fat cat" recently knocked over a $35,000 wooden screen sculpture by artist Billy Al Bengston, causing "pretty serious" damage. 
Another diner with a cigarette came too close to a painting by Max Cole, leaving a charcoal stain. 
Most paintings, though, are under glass and rarely get damaged. 

   Many diners who buy art say their purchases are serendipitous. 
Jane Hurd, chief executive officer of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, was having lunch at L.A. Nicola when she saw a wooden sculpture. 
"I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I came back later and bought it," Ms. Hurd says; she won't disclose the price. 

   And Lynette Duensing, a video engineer, dined on a seafood salad with friends at the same restaurant before attending a crowded art opening in the adjoining Martini Lounge. 
Ms. Duensing liked a clay sculpture on a linen background by artist Gail Taylor, priced at $700, so she bought it on the spot. 
"It reminded me of South American art, and I have a big interest in that, " she says. 

   The two-week show also worked out well for Ms. Taylor, who sold eight pieces. 
"I'm trying to get another show in another restaurant this summer," she says. 
"The average person doesn't go to galleries, and I want to be a working artist."

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paint manufacturers learn the
oldest lesson of all - A sector shake-up has shown that the customer must
still come first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
New technology is not enough. Without a network of customers to sell to,
innovators are doomed to licensing.
So said Mr Alex Ramig, one of the US's most respected industrial chemists,
when discussing ICI's pollution-reducing car paint Aquabase in 1991.
Yesterday, his words proved prophetic - although Mr Ramig, who was picked up
by ICI when it bought the US paint giant Glidden in 1986 and now heads
paints research, was part of making them so.
ICI has withdrawn from a joint venture to provide paints for European car
makers, leaving Du Pont, its US partner, to go it alone with an Aquabase
licence. Du Pont already has a network of customers in the US on which to
base a marketing strategy.
ICI quit after a four-year programme to adapt Aquabase - which uses water
instead of organic solvents - for the vehicle repair market. It already has
a customer network of thousands of vehicle repair shops worldwide and thinks
it will do better. The move marks the latest stage of a 12-year
reorganisation of world industrial paint markets.
Industrial paints are high technology products, and big business. Modern
anti-corrosion guarantees rely on a vehicle's paint, and paint used during
manufacture in Europe alone is worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 969m) a
year. Vehicle repair worldwide generates annual sales of about Pounds 2bn.
As manufacturers of vehicles, televisions sets, video recorders, and
consumer durables 'went global' in the 1980s, their suppliers - paintmakers
included - were forced to follow suit. The result was a rash of mergers and
acquisitions as giants such as ICI and Courtaulds of the UK, PPG and Du Pont
of the US, BASF and Herberts of Germany and Akzo of the Netherlands, bought
their way into national paint markets around the world.
A vigorous shakeout is now under way. Research and development has to be
continuous and is expensive; each company is concentrating on markets where
it has the best prospects, shedding businesses which cannot justify their
consumption of working capital.
Even the acquisitive Netherlands chemical company Akzo - which last year
bought Sweden's Casco Nobel, which in turn had swallowed Beckers to dominate
Scandinavian markets - is trying to sell its European manufacturing
automotive coatings business to PPG, the world market leader.
Mr Austin O'Malley, who heads PPG's European paints operations, said
yesterday the deal was now only waiting for the approval of the Netherlands
and Belgian governments. Go-ahead will trigger big PPG investment in Akzo's
former plant and laboratories.
Courtaulds, best known for the International Paint brand of marine coatings,
has turned itself into a transportation sector specialist. It bought ICI's
aircraft painting business in 1992. It is also a leader in powder coatings -
which use no solvents, so are the most environmentally friendly of all.
ICI decided to go for powder markets, too. In 1992 it tried to merge its
powder business with Ferro, the US leader, but withdrew after doubts over
management structure and capital needs. It then sold the business to Ferro.
The lesson - that technology alone does not make a market - is shown in an
ICI success story. Glidden developed an environmentally friendly, inert,
tasteless, water-based lacquer for spraying the insides of aluminium drinks
cans, which separates the contents from the metal of the can and ensures
that the drink tastes the same worldwide.
Thanks to Glidden's long standing as a supplier to the canning industry, and
ICI's similar position in the rest of the world, ICI now has 44 per cent of
the US market and 32 per cent in Europe.

completion

<TEXT>
Competition in the European market for painting cars during manufacture  -
worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 975m) a year - is likely to intensify
following the German and Dutch authorities' approval last week of the sale
of Akzo's share in the business to PPG, the US industrial coatings
specialist.
The takeover, now in the final stages of European Union approval, will
reduce numbers of principal competitors to three - PPG; Herberts, the
industrial coatings subsidiary of Hoechst, the German chemicals group; and
BASF, another big German chemicals company.
This rationalisation will allow each group to step up the fight for market
share.
Although Herberts and BASF dominate their national market, PPG is believed
to have at least 35 per cent of total European sales, while industry sources
estimate Herberts' European share at around 25 per cent and BASF's as
approaching 20 per cent.
Akzo claimed a 9 per cent share. ICI withdrew from the market last month
when it abandoned IDAC, a six-year joint venture with Du Pont based near
Cologne. Du Pont will continue alone, with what was claimed as an 11 per
cent share at the time of the break-up.
Mr Austin O'Malley, managing director of PPG's European business, said
yesterday he was expecting vigorous competition as PPG hurried to integrate
Akzo technology, products, research and development.
PPG's tactic will be to offer manufacturers the chance to completely
outsource the painting process at a lower cost than buying materials and
technical support at competitive prices and doing the job themselves, as
now.
PPG's acquisition of Akzo's business - coupled with an earlier alliance with
Bollig and Kempe, a German spray painting specialist - will give it a full
range of all the products and technologies involved.

<HEAD>Medieval Painting Stolen from Prague Gallery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16th century painting by Lucas
Cranach the Elder worth $200,000 was stolen from Prague's National
Gallery, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said ``An Enamored Old Man,''
painted by the German master in 1531, disappeared on Wednesday.
   Czechoslovak radio and television announced the theft in news
bulletins, describing the missing picture. Customs authorities also
were alerted, the daily said.
   The Gallery's 13,500 paintings in several locations in Prague
include Rubens' ``Gathering of the Olympic Gods'' and Titian's
``Lady at her Toilet.'' They make up what is considered one of the
finest collections of medieval art in central Europe.
   Czechoslovakia has become a popular target for international
crime after the revolution last year that lifted travel
restrictions and eased police controls.
   ``Problems with guarding valuable works of art in the National
Gallery have apparently not yet been solved,`` the daily said.

<HEAD>Johns' Painting Sets New High For A Contemporary Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   For the second day in a row, a record price was
paid for a Jasper Johns painting: $17.05 million for the oil titled,
``False Start,'' Sotheby's announced.
   The sale of the canvas painting, painted in 1959 shortly after
Johns' first one-man show at Leo Castelli Gallery in 1958, occurred
during a record-setting auction of contemporary art Thursday, said
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America.
   It was the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a
contemporary artist, Ms. Brooks said.
   ``It was always a jewel,'' she said of the painting, which
features splashes of color and the angled stencils of the words of
various colors.
   The painting, which had been owned by private collectors, was
part of a $66.3 million sale that set a record for a contemporary
art auction, she said. She declined to name the winning bidder.
   More than 3,000 people crowded into a main hall and two other
sales rooms to participate in the bidding, she said.
   Ms. Brooks said it was ``one of the most amazing auctions'' she
had seen.
   ``The breadth of this market is something we had expected was
there, but it was confirmed tonight by the prices that were paid,''
Ms. Brooks said.
   Besides the contemporary art sale, a separate auction was
conducted for paintings from the collection of Victor W. Ganz, who
died in 1987.
   A dozen paintings from the collection, started in 1947, were sold
for $48.5 million. About $16 million of the amount was included in
the total for the night for contemporary art, bringing the total
night's sales to $98.5 million, said Sotheby's spokeswoman Diana
Levitt.
   Also at Thursday's sale, a record $3.96 million for an Andy
Warhol painting was paid for a silkscreen canvas titled, ``Marilyn
Monroe (Twenty Times),'' Ms. Levitt said. The painting shows the
face of the actress 20 times.
   Records were also set for 15 other artists, Ms. Levitt said.
   On Wednesday, a Swedish art collector paid $7.04 million for a
painting by Johns of an all-white American flag, Christie's said.
   Hans Thulin, chairman of a Swedish real estate conglomerate, put
down the winning bid for the painting, ``White Flag.''
   The sale price of ``White Flag,'' which was estimated to be worth
$5 million to $8 million, stood for one day as the most ever paid
for a work of contemporary art and the most ever paid for a work by
a living artist, according to Christie's.
   Johns' ``Diver,'' which sold for $4.18 million in May, held the
previous records.
