were still moving under a dark cloud Monday.;    "Think of it," running back

<TEXT>     The 49ers came to their Santa Clara training facility for a morning
meeting, to receive checkout physicals, to clean out their lockers and to try
to come to terms with their 15-13 loss to the New York Giants in Sunday's NFC
championship game.;    "We're not ashamed of our season," Coach George Seifert
said. "But I think we're all very frustrated that we came up short of what was
originally the goal.";    The goal of making history, of being the first team
to win three consecutive Super Bowls, died when Giants place-kicker Matt Bahr
kicked the winning field goal on the game's final play.;    "It's a sad
feeling," said tackle Steve Wallace. "In four seconds it all came to an end.";
   Defensive end Larry Roberts said, "We fell just short of a goal that may
never be tested again.";    The loss brought to the surface questions that had
been brewing all season, questions that the 49ers had hoped to postpone for at
least another week.;    One main question: How will the running game be
repaired? No one had an answer, but the inability to run the ball was
painfully obvious in the loss to the Giants, when the Niners rushed for just
39 yards.;    "Guys like Lawrence Taylor were just laying their ears back and
coming at us," Wallace said. "Teams knew they didn't have to shut down our
run.";    Running back Roger Craig left the building without speaking to
reporters, but his erratic season, which ended with a crucial fourth-quarter
fumble, created speculation about his future role with the team.;    "He'll be
back," receiver Jerry Rice said. "I'll make sure of that.";    Seifert would
only say, "Roger Craig is our starter at this time. When we go to camp, I
would foresee it being a very competitive situation.";    In upcoming weeks,
the Niners must make decisions on what positions they want to strengthen
through the possible signing of Plan B free agents and the draft. They also
must decide the current players they want to protect from Plan B free agency.;
   Seifert said it was too early to make personnel decisions.;    "I imagine
there will be changes on the team, which there is every year," he said.;   
Some players were already guessing that they would be part of that change.
Running back Spencer Tillman, who was in the last year of his contract and who
wasn't protected last season, said that he was sure he "won't be protected."
Linebacker Jim Fahnhorst, who spent most of the season on injured reserve,
also said he expected to be left unprotected.;    But Seifert said that he did
not plan sweeping changes for his team, which finished with an NFL-best 14-2
regular-season record.;    "It's been said that now we're supposed to stop and
rebuild and do this whole thing all over again," Seifert said. "A lot of
people are saying that the dynasty's over. I don't necessarily believe that's
the case. We can still be a good football team. We still have a number of very
good football players on the team.";    And the loss to the Giants might make
the 49ers that much hungrier.;    "We'll cope with losing," Rice said before
he drove away. "We'll make this an incentive.";  49ERS' PLAYOFF LOSSES;

<P>
Joe Montana and his teammates staked their bids for greatness Sunday as the 
quarterback led the San Francisco 49ers to a 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos 
in Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw five touchdown passes, a Super Bowl record. He now has a career 
total of 11, another record. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers became the first National Football League team to win back-to-back 
championships in 10 years, since the Pittsburgh Steelers did it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the greatest quarterback ever to play this game," said 49er 
Coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also tied the Steelers with their fourth Super Bowl victory. Like the 
Steelers, the 49ers have never lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos tied the Minnesota Vikings with their fourth Super Bowl loss. Like 
the Vikings, the Broncos have never won. 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw touchdown passes of 20, 38 and 28 yards to Jerry Rice; a 7-yarder 
to Brent Jones, and one for 35 to John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 33, completed 78.3% of his passes in his three postseason games. He 
threw 11 touchdown passes and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In the three first halves, when the games were marginally more competitive, 
Montana was even better: 79.3% with nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game was a mismatch. The Broncos came in 12-point underdogs, the 
largest spread in 20 years, and promptly fell behind, 7-0, when Montana drove 
the 49ers 66 yards on their first possession, finishing the drive with a 
20-yard pass to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos closed to 7-3 on David Treadwell's 42-yard field goal, then forced 
a San Francisco punt and took over in good field position, at their 49. 
</P>
<P>
However, halfback Bobby Humphrey fumbled and the 49ers' Kevin Fagan recovered. 
Montana drove the 49ers in again, throwing a 7-yard scoring pass to his tight 
end, Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then drove the 49ers 69 yards for a 20-3 lead. Then, with 1:38 left in 
the second quarter, he took them 59 yards to score again, requiring 64 seconds 
to run five plays, the last a 38-yard pass to Rice behind Bronco safety Dennis 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's John Elway threw interceptions on the first two Bronco possessions of 
the second half. The 49ers converted both into touchdowns and led, 41-3. 
</P>
<P>
Elway went 10 for 26, was sacked four times and held to 8 yards in his four 
rushes. Coach Dan Reeves let backup Gary Kubiak finish the last 9:28. 
</P>
<P>
Records fell throughout the second half. The 49ers' 55 points eclipsed the 
record 46, set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Rice's three touchdowns 
and Roger Craig's two gave each a career total of four in Super Bowls, tying 
them with the Steelers' Franco Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert became the second rookie coach to win a Super Bowl, joining Baltimore's 
Don McCafferty. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have won Super Bowls in 1982, '85, '89 and '90. The National 
Conference has won the last six Super Bowls, since the AFC Raiders' victory in 
1984.

Responses to Monday's issue -- how should the 49ers go about stopping the

much about the Giants' passing game. I think they should have a four-man line,
and they should also blitz one of their linebackers at various times from
different angles. That way they'll rattle Hostetler and possibly force him
into some mistakes."; Michael Garcia; San Jose;    "If the Niners score early

<LEADPARA>  ABOUT THE SERIES: This long-running matchup is the most bitter for the 49ers.
As division and conference rivals dating to 1950, the 49ers and Los Angeles
Rams have met twice each season except for 1989, when they played three times
-- the third game being the NFC Championship Game, a comfortable 30-3 victory
by the 49ers at Candlestick Park.;   While the 49ers might hold the advantage
in postseason games against the Rams -- there has been only that one -- Los
Angeles clearly has the regular-season lock on this series, maintaining a
48-32 edge. There have been two ties, one on each team's home field.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   TURNING POINT: Now here's what makes this thing so interesting: Since 1981,
the teams have split the annual series six times, with victories coming at the
opponent's ballpark. These days, that just about kills any notion about a
home-field advantage for a 49ers-Rams contest.;   Before then, however, the
Rams made a habit of nailing the 49ers, sweeping them 15 times from 1950 to
1981. Longtime 49ers' fans will recall these as the down days when the local
team was, well, lousy.;   But thanks in part to the Rams, the tide turned in
1981, the year the 49ers bounced back from a 1-2 start to win 12 of their last
13 games and their first Super Bowl title, on a 26-21 victory over the
Cincinnati Bengals. The 49ers swept the Rams that season, but it took that
second victory, in Anaheim naturally -- a 33-31 comeback capped by a late Joe
Montana-led scoring drive and a Ray Wersching field goal -- to firmly
establish respectability in the minds of players and fans.; WHAT THEY SAY: Joe
Montana: "Our biggest rival has to be the Rams, because they beat us for years
when I first got here. . . . Well, everybody did. But they did it a little
more consistently than anybody else.";   Wide receiver Jerry Rice: "When two
teams really dislike each other -- like the Rams, they're right down the road
from us -- that's what really makes a good rivalry."; 49ERS VS. RAMS; (box)
FIRST GAME OF SERIES: In 1950, the Rams defeated the 49ers twice: 35-14 on
Oct. 1 and 28-21 on Nov. 5.;   (box) SERIES RECORD: The Rams lead 48-32-2 in
regular-season games.;   (box) THE LAST TIME THESE TEAMS MET: They split games
last season: The Rams won at Candlestick 28-17 on Nov. 25, and the 49ers won
at Anaheim Stadium 26-10 on Dec. 17.;   (box) THE NEXT TIME THESE TEAMS MEET:
Sept. 22 at Candlestick Park.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; CLUB; NEW-YORK; COACH; PROFILE; CHART  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells is a Jersey guy and proud of it.;    He
played high school football in Oradell, N.J., cheered for the Giants when he
was growing up and now lives in Upper Saddle River. He drives through the
Jersey swamplands to work every day, often stopping at a diner to talk with
Jersey guys about Jersey's finest team, the one he has in the Super Bowl for
the second time in five years.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PARCELLS DESERVES A PARCEL OF CREDIT
UNDER HIM, GIANTS ARE A WINNING PACKAGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV: A Viewer's Guide  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I walk into this joint the other day," Parcells said last week, "and it
killed me. There are all of these guys sitting in there -- you know the way
they are. They see me, and from everywhere all I hear is, 'Hey Bill, goin'
beat them Beahs?' They're yelling it at me from the trucks, from behind the
counters, from everywhere.";    Sweet victory;  The Giants beat the Bears and
then the 49ers. The victory over the 49ers was quintessential Parcells, won
without a touchdown and with help from a bunch of skill-position players who
resemble fireflies when compared with the fireworks of the 49ers' offense.;   
"You saw a helluva game," Parcells said afterward. "It might not have been as
wide open as some people would like, but I'm sure Woody Hayes and Bear Bryant
would have enjoyed it.";    Parcells, like those fellows, is blunt. He often
tells reporters, "Fellas, it's not that complicated.";    This attitude
probably has cost him a few coach-of-the-year votes along the way. Parcells is
perceived as the caretaker of an always-solid, rarely exciting team, a guy who
displays his rapport when he head-butts players in gratitude.;    Since taking
over the team in 1983, his record is 84-52-1 -- fifth best among active
coaches -- including 7-3 in playoff games.;    He went 3-12 his first season
but hasn't won fewer than nine games in a full season since. This season's
Giants are 15-3, and they head into the Super Bowl with only three offensive
and five defensive starters from their 39-20 victory over the Denver Broncos
in Super Bowl XXI.;    Putting trust in players; Parcells won in the playoffs
this season and during the 1986 season by placing his trust in several players
who might not get picked up if they were cut tomorrow.;    You have heard of
the Buffalo Bills' no-huddle offense? The Giants should bill theirs the
no-offense huddle.;    Their quarterback is career backup Jeff Hostetler.
Their only true running threat is Ottis Anderson, 33, who was considered
washed up three years ago. Their receivers are Mark Ingram and Stephen Baker,
neither of whom ranked in the top 20 in the NFC in catches or yards, and their
tight end, Mark Bavaro, is considering retirement.;    And although the
Giants' defense is loaded with talent, remember that starting cornerback
Everson Walls was let go by Dallas and that a rookie, Mike Fox, starts at
defensive end.;    Against the Bears, Parcells used his extra week of
preparation to switch from his beloved 3-4 defense to a 4-3 that held the
Bears to 27 yards rushing, their lowest total in 23 years. Against the 49ers,
he and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick employed an extra defensive back
on first downs to try to discourage the 49ers from passing, then went back to
a 3-4 so the Giants could blitz from any and all angles in an attempt to
rattle Joe Montana.;    Parcells also cut the fleet Hostetler loose on
bootlegs and play-action rollouts that nullified the 49ers' rush, gave his
receivers extra time and capitalized on Hostetler's uncanny accuracy on the
run.;    Then there's Parcells' ability to motivate. The Giants looked to be
struggling late in the season, losing three of their last six games, beating
only 6-10 Minnesota, 5-11 Phoenix and 1-15 New England.;    Parcells lit into
his players in a team meeting that spawned a players-only meeting. The players
-- particularly cornerback Mark Collins -- didn't appreciate it.;    But they
responded. And Parcells is never one to get in the way of his players' freedom
of speech, as long as he has the freedom to respond.;    "I don't care what
they have to say," Parcells said, "as long as they realize that I might have
something to say, too.";    He was expected to have a lot to say this week as
reporters gathered around to hear how he beat the fearsome 49ers without
scoring a touchdown, with a gimpy backup quarterback, with a tread-worn
running back and an assortment of other handicaps that don't seem to faze this
Jersey guy.;    Remember his line: "Fellas, it's not that complicated.";

Joe Montana put the cap on a record-breaking regular season as the San 
Francisco 49ers beat the Bears, 26-0, and set their sights on the first Super 
Bowl of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extremely exciting 10 years, no question about it," rookie Coach 
George Seifert said after the 49ers (14-2) wrapped up their second-best record 
ever. No other NFL team won more than 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very fortunate to have been part of it," Seifert said. "The trick now 
is to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice and set an NFL season 
record for highest quarterback rating as the 49ers won their fifth consecutive 
game and the Bears dropped their sixth straight. Mike Cofer kicked four field 
goals and won the NFL scoring title with 136 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we feel good about what we did today," Montana said, shrugging off 
talk of personal achievements. "It took a while to get things going, but our 
defense just played a heck of a game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, whose better record was 15-1 in 1984 en route to their second of 
three Super Bowl championships, will have a week off before playing host to an 
NFC playoff game against either Philadelphia or the NFC Central champion. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka vowed the Bears would bounce back after "hitting 
bottom" with 10 losses in their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line we lost our confidence," Ditka said. "I don't really 
believe we're that bad a football team, although I guess you have to believe 
that after today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad day and it's been a sad season, but they come and go. We've had a 
lot of great seasons. . . . If all of a sudden football passed us by in '89, 
and I don't think it did, then I'd say we change the system. But we just 
haven't executed very well." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago missed the playoffs for the first time since 1983.

NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: IT'S THE NINERS AND NINE NOBODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers seem to be in a league of their own as they enter the 
NFL playoffs -- so much so that perhaps an appropriate title for this 
spectacular is the 49ers and the Nine Dwarfs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, attempting to become the first team in a decade to repeat as Super 
Bowl champions, posted a 14-2 regular-season record. They were two games better 
than any other team in the league and beat four of the other nine playoff 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, one of six division champions with a bye today when the two 
wild-card games will be played, are on much more of a roll than they were a 
year ago, when they started 6-5, won four straight and then lost their 
regular-season finale to the Rams, 38-16. That loss knocked the New York Giants 
out of the playoffs, leading Giant quarterback Phil Simms to complain that he 
watched the 49ers "lay down like dogs" against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the 49ers routed the Chicago Bears, 26-0, in their finale, even 
though they already had clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"In some respects, that was a very decisive win. But, as coaches, we look at 
certain things that we can do better," said 49er Coach George Seifert. "And 
we'll have to do them better in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers do as well as they did in the regular season, that would be good 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
They even seem to have history on their side. The NFL has a record of ending a 
decade with a team winning back-to-back titles. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Eagles did it in 1948-49, the Baltimore Colts did it in 
1958-59 and the Pittsburgh Steelers did it in 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who are considered by many to be the team of the decade, can join 
Pittsburgh as the only four-time Super Bowl champion. 
</P>
<P>
They also can become known as one of the best post-World War II teams, joining 
the 1946-55 Cleveland Browns, who won four titles in the old All-America 
Conference and three NFL titles; the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s, who won 
five titles and the first two Super Bowls, and the Steelers of the 1970s, who 
won four Super Bowls in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
That's why all the focus is on the 49ers, who will play either the Philadelphia 
Eagles or the Minnesota Vikings in their first playoff game. If they win, 
they'd face either the Vikings, Giants or Rams in the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
Of those four teams, the Rams seem to have the best shot of upsetting the 
49ers. They handed the 49ers one of their two losses this season and could have 
swept them if they hadn't blown two 17-point leads in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Rams will be getting to the NFC title game. They will first 
have to win at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, then at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is likely to be nasty in both places, and the Rams aren't noted for 
playing well in cold weather. They barely beat the New England Patriots, 24-20, 
in Foxboro, Mass., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers beat the Giants and Eagles during the regular season, and the Vikings 
would have to face San Francisco on the road at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers beat the Vikings, 34-9, in the playoffs last season. The Vikings, 
whose home is the Metrodome in Minneapolis, have become such a dome team that 
they're 1-8 in their last nine outdoor games. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings upset the 49ers two seasons ago in the playoffs, 36-24, at 
Candlestick when the 49ers were 13-2. But quarterback Joe Montana was rusty and 
ineffective in that game after being injured at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's had trouble with his ribs this season, Montana finished the 
season by hitting 10 of 21 passes against the Bears before coming out early in 
the third quarter. It wasn't vintage Montana, but it was good enough to enable 
him to set the record for quarterback rating, with 112.4. Milt Plum of the 
Cleveland Browns had the old mark of 110.4 in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Montana also finished the season by completing 70.2 percent of his passes, the 
third-best mark in NFL history. Ken Anderson completed 70.55 of his passes in 
1982, the nine-game strike season, and Sammy Baugh completed 70.3 in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers hadn't pulled Montana so soon in the Bear game, he might have 
broken that record. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't find out until there were three minutes left in the game," Seifert 
said. "Had we known earlier in the third period, we might have put him back in. 
But the plan was to do basically what we did." 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, a team will qualify for the Super Bowl only because that's the way 
the system works. The Denver Broncos were the only team to win more than nine 
regular-season games. They finished 11-5 and are favored to go to the Super 
Bowl for the third time in the last four seasons. But they lost at home to the 
Eagles and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Elway didn't have one of his better seasons, but Denver 
prospered when defensive coordinator Wade Phillips rebuilt the defense into a 
unit that ranked No. 2 in the AFC, No. 1 against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos lost two of their last three games, and it may not be considered 
stunning if they lose in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The team that might have the best chance of beating them is the Cleveland 
Browns, who defeated the Vikings and Houston Oilers in the final two weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of running back Kevin Mack, who was in jail on a drug charge 
earlier in the season, has added a dimension to the Browns' sputtering offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, who scored the winning touchdown against the Oilers with 39 seconds left 
Saturday night, said, "I guess when all the trouble started, it was hard to see 
ahead to the good times coming back again. But a lot of people believed in me, 
and now I'm back." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, the Buffalo Bills and Oilers were given good shots 
of making the Super Bowl, but both teams are on the defensive after struggling 
down the stretch. The Bills lost three of their last four, and the Oilers lost 
their last two. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Coach Marv Levy said, 'We've been in first place for 32 straight games 
(two seasons). Sometimes it's hard to please people." 
</P>
<P>
That's mainly because they were only 9-7, and because the players don't seem to 
like quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers also finished 9-7, and Houston Coach Jerry Glanville said, "We don't 
have to apologize for being one of the three (actually four) teams that have 
made the playoffs the last three years (along with the Browns, Vikings and 
49ers). There are 18 teams that wish they were in, but they're not." 
</P>
<P>
One team not apologizing is the Pittsburgh Steelers, the hottest team in the 
AFC. They won their last three games, although the games were against teams 
with losing records -- the New York Jets, Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

YOUNG'S MONTANA-LIKE HEROICS GIVE 49ERS A WIN OVER VIKINGS;

NFC: BACKUP QUARTERBACK'S TOUCHDOWN PASS PLAY WITH 29 SECONDS LEFT IS THE

<P>
Steve Young, understudy to Joe Montana, used a Montana script to rally the San 
Francisco 49ers to a 20-17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who relieved Montana in the second half, teamed with John Taylor on a 
34-yard touchdown pass play with 29 seconds left to enable the 49ers to finish 
the regular season 14-2, the best record in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Montana has led countless comebacks. Last week, Young had the chance, but the 
49ers lost, 13-10, to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Coach Jerry Burns wasn't surprised by Young's heroics Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It epitomizes the whole season. We had our chance to win the game and we 
couldn't stop them," Burns said. "I just had a premonition they'd go right down 
and score and we wouldn't stop them. The secondary play was sick. The pass 
rush. The whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"They know how to win and this team doesn't. Anytime you win you can feed off 
that success. You know that, in the past, you've come back and won games. This 
team hasn't done it." 
</P>
<P>
NFC Central champions last season, the Vikings (6-10) finished in last place 
for the first time since 1984. They ended the season with a four-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to be scratching to find anything positive," Burns said. "When 
I saw that guy shoot that gun at the end, that was the most positive thing I 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
While Burns' most frustrating season finally ended, the 49ers will now begin 
concentrating on the playoffs in an effort to become the first NFL team to win 
three consecutive Super Bowls and five overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a decent day and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to catch 100 balls," 
said 49er receiver Jerry Rice, who caught nine passes for 118 yards and became 
the fourth player ever to reach the 100-reception mark in a season. "I think 
that's something to be proud of, but I'm just looking forward to the first 
playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' 18th consecutive road victory extended their own league record. 
However, they won't enjoy the "road-field advantage" in the playoffs, having 
clinched home-field throughout the playoffs two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert said the victory wasn't insignificant. 
"Coming into the playoffs, winning the game instead of losing, allows us to 
have pride in ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, which won 15 games in 1984 and 14 in 1989 and went on to win the 
Super Bowl those years, used victories over Minnesota to springboard to its 
last three championships. The Vikings' last three seasons have ended with 
losses to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
As he had planned to do before the game, Seifert started Montana and used Young 
for the entire second half. Montana completed 10 of 20 passes for 88 yards and 
had one pass intercepted as the 49ers trailed, 10-0, and had a scoreless first 
half for the first time since Dec. 17, 1989 against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Young sparked the 49ers with his passing and scrambling. He was 15 of 24 for 
205 yards passing and added 59 yards in six rushes. 
</P>
<P>
On the winning drive, Young completed six of seven passes for 88 yards and also 
had a two-yard dive on fourth-and-one. Ken Stills was the closest Minnesota 
player to Taylor when he caught Young's pass at the 16 and went untouched into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a play that takes a while to develop," Young said. "I told the guys in 
the huddle that we needed a little extra tick to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Young's 14-yard touchdown pass to Rice with 8:37 left -- which he set up with 
scrambles of 14 and 19 yards -- gave the 49ers a 13-10 lead. Minnesota came 
back to go up, 17-13, on Alfred Anderson's one-yard run with 3:14 left before 
Young did a splendid impression of a Montana rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, who sacked Montana and Young six times, with Ken Clarke getting 
three of the sacks, used an aggressive defense and Herschel Walker's 
versatility to take their 10-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Fuad Reveiz's 34-yard field goal, Walker capped a 79-yard drive with a 
nine-yard touchdown run. Walker had four carries for 30 yards, caught an 
18-yard pass and threw a 12-yard halfback option pass to D.J. Dozier during the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer's field goals of 29 and 35 yards made it 10-6 early in the fourth 
quarter.

<HEADLINE>  49ERS FIND LAST PLACE TO BE A STRANGE PLACE
THE MIGHTY TAKE WORST FALL SINCE '82  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Falcons 39, 49ers 34  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams won, improving their record to 3-3.;   Sunday,
the Atlanta Falcons -- as the 49ers are so painfully aware -- also won,
improving to 3-3.;   But Sunday, the 49ers lost, falling to 2-4 for the first
time since 1982, and falling into last place in the NFC West.;   It is the
first time since 1979 that the 49ers had sole possession of last place this
late in the season. In 1979, the 49ers finished 2-14.;   "We can't worry about
that right now, what place we're in," linebacker Bill Romanowski said. "Right
now, everybody's got to look at themselves and say, 'What the heck can I do to
improve this team and make this team win?' ";   But the ugly truth of the
matter is that the only NFC teams with worse records than the 49ers are Green
Bay and Tampa Bay (each 1-5). The 49ers have the same record as the lowly New
England Patriots.;   "The season isn't halfway over," guard Guy McIntyre said.
"This is the NFL. One day you're down, and the next day you're on the top of
the world.";   The 49ers have a long way to go to get to the top of the world.
They have four more divisional games to play -- two against first-place New
Orleans and one each against Atlanta and the Rams.;   Sunday's game against
the Falcons was a critical one, as both teams were aware.;   "We said before
the game that whichever team won the game had a real shot at the playoffs,"
Falcons Coach Jerry Glanville said.;   If ever there was a "must-win" game for
the 49ers, this was it.;   "We needed the win," safety Todd Bowles said. "It's
a shock losing ball games. It hurts a lot. We'll see what we're made of now."  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  HIT ON MONTANA SIGNALS THE END FOR NINERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NFC Championship: Giants 15, 49ers 13
Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A bone on the outside of Montana's right hand -- his passing hand -- was
fractured. His sternum was badly bruised.;    "If the 49ers had won today, Joe
would not have been able to play in next week's game," said Michael
Dillingham, the team physician, in a prepared statement.;    So that was it.
Even though the 49ers were leading 13-9, even though Steve Young is a fine
quarterback, even though the 49ers' defense continued to keep the Giants out
of the end zone, as Montana lay huddled on the ground at the 20-yard line, the
life seemed to drain from the team.;    The 49ers eventually lost 15-13 on
Matt Bahr's last-second field goal.;    "For any team to have a chance to (win
three Super Bowls) you have to have a player like Joe Montana," said tackle
Steve Wallace.;    The Giants figured that without Montana the 49ers were in
trouble. So they came after him.;    "We wanted to hit him as often as we
could," Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. "We wanted to give him
something to think about.";    The hit Montana took in the fourth quarter was
the Giants' third sack of the game. But he was under constant pressure.;   
"They didn't do anything they hadn't done before," said 49ers offensive-line
coach Bobb McKittrick. "It was just different forms of blitzes.";    In the
second quarter, Montana was hit by Marshall, who went past left tackle Bubba
Paris. In the third quarter, Taylor and Erik Howard combined for a sack.;   
"We put a lot of pounding on him, and you could tell he was getting
frustrated," Taylor said.;    The Giants were even more motivated after 49ers
nose tackle Jim Burt leveled New York quarterback Jeff Hostetler, who left the
game for three plays.;    Taylor said he told Burt after the play: " 'If
that's the way you want to play it, OK. Somebody else is going to lose a
quarterback.' We did it, but it wasn't a cheap shot.";    Within minutes,
Taylor's threat was realized. On the 49ers' next possession, on third-and-10
from their 23, the line pushed inside, allowing Montana to roll to his right.
Marshall was cut down by Tom Rathman.;    Montana looked for an open receiver,
but Taylor was coming at him and forced him to step back. By that time,
Marshall had gotten up off the ground and charged past Paris, gaining
momentum.;    "After he was cut, I didn't think about him," Paris said. "I was
looking for the next person. Then he runs past.";    Wallace said: "Joe was
naked out there.";    Marshall grabbed Montana, and they both fell to the
ground. The ball flew out of Montana's hand and rolled 6 yards upfield, where
Wallace fell on it.;    "I'm not out to hurt anybody," Marshall said. "I felt
bad that he got hurt.";    Everyone knew instantly how hard Montana had been
hit.;    "I heard it from 40 yards away," Giants cornerback Everson Walls
said. "It was like one of those NFL Films sound effects, but this was real."; 
  Young was the first to reach Montana.;    "I just wanted to make sure he was
OK," Young said. "It looked worse than normal.";    It was reminiscent of a
January day four years earlier, when Montana was slammed to the ground by
Burt, then playing for the Giants. As it was then, it was clear that this
injury was serious.;    After several minutes, with doctors and trainers and
Ronnie Lott, huddled around him, Montana -- who had completed 18 of 26 passes
for 190 yards and a touchdown -- was helped to the bench, walking shakily.;   
He stayed there the remainder of the game.;    Afterward, the 49ers' locker
room was quiet. In the training room, Montana lay on his back on the training
table, his arm raised in the air.;    The official injury report from
Dillingham was that Montana had a bruised sternum and that the fifth
metacarpal -- the bone below Montana's little finger -- of his right hand was
fractured. Montana will be X-rayed again today and treatment for the injury
will be determined either today or Tuesday. Dillingham said that an operation
on Montana's hand was a possibility.;    When the locker room was almost
empty, Montana -- flanked by security guards -- made his way out the door.;   
"I have no idea," Montana said, when asked how his hand, which was in a cast,
was broken. In a statement to 49ers public relations officials, Montana said
he was having trouble breathing because of his bruised sternum.;    Montana
walked up the ramp from the locker room, back onto the Candlestick field,
where his wife, Jennifer, waited with a car.;    Montana got in the passenger
seat and was driven away, through the garbage blowing across the field in
empty Candlestick Park.; RIVALRY EXTENDS TO NEW DECADE; A look at the

BRONCOS' TIMING-NOT THEIR TALENT -- IS PRETTY LOUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for the Denver Broncos even as 
they celebrated their third American Football Conference championship in four 
years after dispatching the Cleveland Browns Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They were proud of making it back to the Super Bowl, and rightfully so. Two 
consecutive Super Bowl blowouts, the second against the Washington Redskins in 
1988, had forced them to look hard in the mirror and change their ways. Almost 
everything about them, from coaching staff to style of defense, had been 
overhauled. It was not easy. The Broncos went 8-8 in the 1988 season and failed 
to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But now, just a year later, they were back in the Super Bowl. And in their 
locker room Sunday the talk was that this year would be different, no Orange 
Crushed headlines the day after the Super Bowl. They were painfully earnest 
about all this and had worked hard to recover their pride. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they spoke, however, the San Francisco 49ers were stamping out the Rams 
with such ferocity that women and children cowered from coast to coast. The 
score in the National Football Conference championship game was 30-3, and the 
Rams were on their knees begging for their lives at the end, or so went the 
inside scoop. 
</P>
<P>
The poor Broncos. Their timing is just plain poor. Had they made their return 
to the Super Bowl a year ago, when the 49ers were more vulnerable, they 
probably would not have taken another mega-beating. The Cincinnati Bengals, if 
you recall, were in the game all the way before a last-minute 49ers touchdown 
beat them. These Broncos are as capable as those Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's edition of the 49ers is many lengths superior. They lost only 
two games, as opposed to five a year ago. Their underrated defense has been 
particularly nettlesome. And, of course, Joe Montana is having a remarkable 
season: his best; one against which all great quarterbacking seasons may be 
compared. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos just do not compare. It is true they have a more balanced offense 
and more physical defense than both of their Super losers, but they still are 
overmatched against these 49ers. Fact is, the 11 1/2-point betting line is too 
little. Not that that is an insult. No team in the parity-puffed, watered-down 
National Football League could stay within two touchdowns of the 49ers right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
So it comes down to this: The Broncos, after all their soul-searching and 
reconstruction, are facing yet another paddling. Those who believe in justice 
had best avert their eyes. The Broncos' lot in life, it appears, is to be the 
well-paid, genial foil, the team that achieves much but, in the end, serves 
primarily as a pillow other teams kick and stomp as final proof of their 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that one thing in the Broncos' favor is their motivation. 
Not in years has a Super Bowl qualifier stimulated such disrespect. The Broncos 
will play for the legitimacy of their name, and teams in such position play 
hard and, often, well. So maybe they have a chance if Montana falls off a train 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' window of opportunity is, simply, a peephole. It is important to 
understand the powerful sweep against which they are bucking. If not for one 
poor game in January, 1988, the 49ers would be on the verge of their third 
consecutive Super Bowl championship and their fourth in six years. It could be 
time to bring out the D-word: Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons ago, the 49ers finished the regular season with a 14-2 record that 
included 41-0 and 48-0 shatterings of the Rams and Chicago Bears in the last 
three weeks. But, inexplicably, they did not show up against the Minnesota 
Vikings in the playoffs, giving a four-loss Redskins team the chance to batter 
the Broncos. The Redskins won fair and square but they were not the best team 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers rebounded to win the Super Bowl last year after a tumultuous regular 
season during which they lost five of their first 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the pieces fit perfectly. Montana is healthy now, and the nucleus of 
players has been together four or five years. The latter makes a big 
difference; the 49ers' combination of talent, teamwork and experience is just 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Cleveland's receivers get open so easily against Denver in the AFC 
championship, one could not help imagining what damage the 49ers' Jerry Rice, 
John Taylor and Roger Craig could inflict if set loose in those open fields. 
Perhaps the only defense that could stop such a passing game is the 49ers' 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that would be worth watching. Let's say we pool our resources -- if every 
fan who watched the game contributed a dollar, we would have $120 million -- 
and buy the Super Bowl and give it to the 49ers. (Final: 34-14.) We would be 
spared another Bronco-bashing, and, instead, we could hold Super Scrimmage I. 
Jerry Rice against Ronnie Lott. That would be super.

<HEADLINE>  LOSS TURNED 49ERS' STOMACHS, HEADS
NEVER AGAIN, SAY VIKINGS' VICTIMS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to end of article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     As a whole, the 49ers franchise has sworn never to underestimate an
opponent as the Niners did in their 36-24 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in the
divisional playoffs after the 1987 regular season. That's why they're taking
the Washington Redskins, their NFC divisional playoff opponent Saturday in
Candlestick Park, so seriously.;    "As far as a dark spot on our playoffs and
team greatness and all that stuff, we'll always remember that," said Carter,
the Niners' starting nose tackle then and now. "I was part of that, and when I
think about that game, it makes me sick. That was humiliating, embarrassing
and something I'll remember the rest of my life.";    There's one main reason
the Niners haven't forgotten the game, and it's not because the loss was
decisive or because it occurred early in the playoffs. After all, there was
the 49-3 divisional playoff loss to the New York Giants in the same round in
the 1986 playoffs. It's an ice pick in the Niners' pride because . . . well,
let Lott explain:;    "That team, probably of all the teams, had the most
momentum going into any playoff situation that I've been a part of," Lott
said. ". . . I think everyone just has one of those  memories that you think
about, that you can't take any situation for granted, and that you have to be
mentally and  physically prepared for an all-out war. The days off, you have
to dream about it. You have to dream about making plays from this day on. A
lot of it is going to rely on skills, but a lot of playoff games are decided .
. . because you want it more than the other guy.";    To the Niners, that's
what hurts about the '87 loss. They had shown over the course of the season
that they were the league's best in virtually every aspect. They had posted a
league-best 13-2 record. They led the league in yards gained (5,987) and
fewest allowed (4,095). They scored the most points (459) and allowed the
fewest (253). They had the league's most proficient passer (Joe Montana, with
a 102.1 quarterback rating) and the league's top scorer (Rice with 123
points).;    "Everything seemed perfect," said center Jesse Sapolu, who in '87
became the starting left guard after Guy McIntyre suffered a foot injury in
the sixth game. "To get beat like that just shows you it doesn't mean one iota
what you do in the regular season.";    What they didn't have against
Minnesota, Lott said, was the heart and desire that have been synonymous with
their subsequent 38-10 regular-season record, 6-0 playoff mark and two
consecutive Super Bowl titles.;    "I think the thing I remember most about
that game was that it seemed like everybody was moving in slow motion," Lott
said. "We didn't fight. We didn't fight like it was the last game of the year.
. . . In that situation, I don't think we even had that.";    And against a
Minnesota team that had routed New Orleans 44-10 in the wild-card game, that's
exactly what they needed. Without it, the Vikings' Anthony Carter beat them
for 278 all-purpose yards and Wade Wilson completed 20 of 34 passes for 298
yards and two touchdowns.;    "I think we worked too hard and never completely
recovered during the extra week," former 49ers coach Walsh said. "We thought
we needed to work on some things, but looking back, we should've eased up
rather than worked harder.";    The game still might have been salvaged had
Walsh made better halftime adjustments, Cross said.;    "That was one of the
few circumstances in which we were out-coached and out-prepared," Cross said
Thursday afternoon. "Things started to happen. They played our wide receivers
very physically and basically took our wide receivers out of the game. We
weren't going to different lengths to compensate for that.";    Walsh could
not be reached Thursday night to respond to that comment, but Vikings
cornerback Carl Lee said he could tell the 49ers sensed early on that they
weren't prepared.;    "I think reality set in as the game went on that they
had not prepared," Lee said Wednesday.;    Rice, for one, has learned his
lesson.;    "Back then, I felt like a rookie," said Rice, who was in his third
NFL season. "I didn't really know how to police myself. I would go out every
day and give it 100 percent. But now I know how to police myself. If the
ball's not coming my way, I might come off the line of scrimmage hard for the
first 5 yards, and then I'm going to ease up and just try to save some of that
for the ballgame.";    If fatigue was the primary factor, Niners Coach George
Seifert has taken every precaution to make certain it isn't Saturday. One-day
vacations were handed out to practically anyone who wanted one last week. In
Rice's case, he was given two days last week to spend in the sauna or on the
massage table.;    There is a difference, however, between relaxing physically
and relaxing mentally, which Lee believes the Niners might also have done in
the '87 playoffs.;    "They were like us and a lot of other teams, in that
when you're already being talked about as being in the Super Bowl, it's very
possible to be complacent. They knew they were the top team, and they knew no
one could beat them.";    That's what concerns Cross. This season's team, he
said, has talked -- or been asked -- about winning a third consecutive Super
Bowl since the end of last season.;    "You're looking at a team now that is
talking similar to the '87 team," Cross said. "They're talking about going to
the Super Bowl. That's usually something better left unsaid.";    There's also

deeply it affected them. Here are some of their comments.; (box) Nose tackle

It was just sickening. You just felt this emptiness inside."; (box) Former

the coach tap him on the shoulder at training camp and tell him he's gone.";

screwed up, we would be talking about four-peat."; (box) Nose tackle Michael

REBOUND FROM TOUGH LOSS; In the three seasons since the 49ers' loss to the
Minnesota Vikings in the second round of the NFC playoffs, they've had a
tremendous run of success. The impact of that loss might be seen by comparing
those three seasons with the 1985 through '87 seasons:; Category

LOTT LEADS HIT PARADE, MAKING 200 POUNDS FEEL LIKE A TON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As New York lost to San Francisco last week, the play that symbolized three 
combative hours in Candlestick Park was probably the hit of the year. 
</P>
<P>
It was the hit that Giant tight end Mark Bavaro absorbed from 49er free safety 
Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't save the game, a low-scoring affair that ended 7-3. The save came 
later -- when Lott made his other big play of a defensive night, a diving, 
one-handed deflection in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But it did raise a good question: How can this guy hit football players 
seemingly harder than anyone else does? 
</P>
<P>
He isn't the biggest 49er. Standing an even 6 feet, Lott, a former USC 
All-American, weighs an even 200 pounds. He is a lightweight next to the man he 
clobbered. 
</P>
<P>
A six-year NFL veteran from Notre Dame, Bavaro goes 6-4 and 245. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lott, timing the hit perfectly, knocked him groggy. 
</P>
<P>
Lott's key is that he is a student of the mechanics of hitting. Muhammad Ali 
would be proud of him. So would any clean liver. 
</P>
<P>
Lott never goes for the knees. And unlike football's other heavy hitters, he 
doesn't attack shoulder-first. 
</P>
<P>
He is a body-to-body hitter. In a classic NFL moment, Giant quarterback Phil 
Simms, hurried by the 49er pass rush, had overthrown the target -- forcing 
Bavaro to stretch far out for the ball -- when Lott smashed him with the entire 
front of his body from the forehead down. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exotic piece of offensive defense. 
</P>
<P>
One unusual thing about pro football is that it seems to attract a good many 
casual fans. 
</P>
<P>
The TV crowd for any big NFL game obviously includes many thousands of passive, 
indifferent, or slightly interested fans -- those who doubt that football is a 
particularly great sport, though they will watch it, idly, on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
That is the only way to explain the audience-survey numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For the Giant-49er game last week, the Nielsen rating was 27. By comparison, 
the World Series last fall averaged 20.8. The NBA finals last spring averaged 
12.4. 
</P>
<P>
The strange truth is that the Neilsen rating for the Super Bowl's pregame show 
is larger than the numbers for championship games in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
In college basketball last spring, the title game hit 20. 
</P>
<P>
Leading into the Super Bowl last winter, the pregame show hit 21.6. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that many football spectators -- specifically, many of those who 
watched the 49ers and Giants last week -- are comparatively undiscerning fans. 
</P>
<P>
They are basketball fans or rock fans or, possibly, fast-car fans who, for a 
night, were drawn to an NFL event because it seemed to be the nation's biggest 
sports event since the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And that accounts for the dichotomy of the national reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Most football fans called it a good defensive game. 
</P>
<P>
Most casual fans called it boring. 
</P>
<P>
Casual fans criticized the 49er defensive team because it never sacked Simms. 
</P>
<P>
Football fans realized that Lott's big hit, for example, was set up by the 49er 
rush on Simms. They realized that for better or worse, football is offense and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
In one of linebacker Lawrence Taylor's big years, the Giant defense will get 
another chance against another brilliant offensive team Saturday when 
quarterback Jim Kelly arrives at the Meadowlands with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo and New York are each 11-2, a tick behind the 49ers. And as the AFC's 
only 11-2 club, the Bills, in the opinion of many, are Super Bowl-bound. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and other NFC clubs have won six consecutive Super Bowl games and 
eight of the last nine. Do the Bills really want to get there? 
</P>
<P>
Won't the AFC's 1990 champion become its seventh consecutive Super Bowl 
casualty? 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the NFC that's been beating the AFC," Buffalo General Manager Bill 
Polian said. "As the regular-season results have told us for years, the 
conferences are about even. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important to understand is that the Super Bowl is a game of matchups. 
And it just happens that most of the teams that won AFC championships in the 
1980s didn't match up well with NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, the 49ers were a super Super Bowl team in the '80s. They've won four 
of the last nine. They'd have beaten anybody. The reason they win so often is 
that their big-play guys are more consistent than anyone else's." 
</P>
<P>
How would the Bills match up with the 49ers or Giants in Super Bowl XXV? 
</P>
<P>
"We have the defense and the quarterback," Polian said. "Defense gets you into 
the playoffs, and quarterbacking takes you the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Of the AFC champions of recent years, only the Cincinnati Bengals have made a 
game of it against the NFC, losing Super Bowl XXIII to the 49ers in the last 
minute, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
In a rematch Sunday, the 49ers caught the Bengals again, 20-17, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Cincinnati is the only AFC team that has matched up well with an (NFC 
champion) lately," the Buffalo executive said. "As you saw again (Sunday), they 
have what it takes to battle Montana all the way -- a big offensive line, good 
play-action passing, an active defense and speed in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"Denver is an example of a team that could win AFC (titles) but didn't match up 
with NFC (champion). They're agile and well conditioned, but built to excel in 
Denver's rarefied air, and sometimes they've been too small." 
</P>
<P>
Will Buffalo beat the Giants Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarterback can do more things on his own than their quarterback," Polian 
said. "But everything depends on how we handle their power." 
</P>
<P>
Quote Department: 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar, Cleveland quarterback commenting on one aspect of the Browns' 
slump: "(Coach) Jim Shofner is the fifth play-caller I've had in six years." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Adderley, Green Bay's Hall of Fame cornerback, on Hall of Famer Dick 
(Night Train) Lane, as quoted by Rick Korch in Pro Football Weekly: "Night 
Train was the best defensive back to ever play the game. I tried to pattern my 
game after him. I've never seen a defensive back hit the way he hit -- I mean, 
take them down, whether it be Jim Taylor or Jim Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Doleman, Minnesota defensive lineman: "I don't like these bye weeks. I 
like getting right back in there and playing."

<HEAD>San Francisco, Cincinnati Going to Super Bowl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati Bengals will meet the San Francisco 49ers in a
Super Bowl rematch for the National Football League title in Miami,
after winning decisive conference championships on Sunday.
   The Bengals, who lost the Super Bowl in 1982 to the 49ers,
defeated Buffalo 21-10 to win the American Football Conference. The
49ers beat the Chicago Bears 28-3 for the National Football
Conference title.
   In Chicago, playing in 30-mph winds and wind-chill factors of
almost 20 degrees below zero, quarterback Joe Montana and receiver
Jerry Rice combined for two touchdown passes and Montana threw a
third to John Frank for the victory.
   It was the first road playoff victory for the 49ers since 1970,
and it dispelled the notion that the Californians would be numbed in
the kind of weather that has been so good to the Bears in playoffs
past.
   In Cincinnati, with the Bengals' star rookie running back Ickey
Woods prancing into the end zone twice and running for 102 yards on
29 carries, the Bengals won their second AFC championship with the
victory over the Bills.
   The Super Bowl will be held on Jan. 22 in Miami.

<LEADPARA>  The New York Giants are preparing for Super Bowl XXV because, in part, they
pounded the 49ers' offense into submission in the NFC championship game Sunday

<HEADLINE>  BILLS' OFFENSE MUCH BETTER THAN 49ERS', GIANTS
SAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Sunday's Game
N.Y. Giants vs. Buffalo in Tampa, Fla., 3:18 p.m. PST. TV: CH7 CH11 CH13
Radio: KCBS (740).  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "They're not the best offense in the league," linebacker Pepper Johnson
said in an interview session at Tampa Stadium. "Against San Francisco, we were
in fourth gear. Now we have to put it in fifth gear for the Super Bowl. We
can't come in here and get embarrassed.";    The AFC champion Buffalo Bills
have done that to the last two defenses they faced, defeating Miami 44-34 in
one AFC playoff game and thumping the Los Angeles Raiders 51-3 for the
conference title.;    They've done it with a combination of Thurman Thomas'
running and Jim Kelly's passing and All-Pro center Kent Hull's blocking, which
may be why the Bills deserve to be held in higher esteem than the 49ers. The
Bills averaged 130 yards rushing and 199.8 yards passing during the regular
season to score 428 points. The Niners scored 75 fewer points with an offense
that averaged 107.4 yards on the ground and 261.1 yards passing.;    Giants
Coach Bill Parcells didn't mention the 49ers directly, but he agreed with
Johnson that the balanced offense of the Bills, ranked sixth in the NFL,
presented a much tougher challenge than the Niners' second-ranked attack.;   
"Offensively, they're probably as good as anybody we've played all year -- in
fact, better," Parcells said of the Bills, putting statistical rankings
aside.;    Whether it's the prospect of facing the Bills or the chance to slap
the Niners -- even Bills linebacker Bruce Smith took a shot, saying he'd
rather have played the 49ers because "everybody's a 49ers' fan and it makes me
sick" -- the Giants' defense downplayed its part in Sunday's 15-13 NFC
championship win.;    For instance, defensive back Everson Walls said his
confidence in the Giants' ability to handle the 49ers was such that he didn't
expect his mistake on the game's only touchdown, a 61-yard scoring pass play
to John Taylor, to cost his team the conference title.;    And judging by
their remarks, the Giants weren't concerned that the Niners' would unleash
more offense Sunday than in the teams' previous meeting Dec. 3, which the
49ers won 7-3.;    Defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, Johnson said, had
told the defensive unit point-blank that he expected it to be even stingier
with the Niners in the rematch.;    "In five years, I never heard Coach
Belichick say we could beat anybody," Johnson said. "He always gives the other
team credit. But against San Francisco, he said we had a much better defense"
than San Francisco had offense.;    It's not as if Johnson regards the Niners'
offense as the runner-up to the Bills', either. Asked about his team's
confidence after having handled "the NFL's best offense," Johnson didn't
realize the reference was to the 49ers. Instead, he flashed back to the
regular season, saying:;    "You mean Washington's?"  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  It's a half-full, half-empty kind of thing for the 49ers.;   "I don't know if
we're tied for second place or if we're tied for last," 49ers Vice President
John McVay said.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  49ERS FALL IN SHADOW OF SAINTS
NEW ORLEANS (5-0) IS CAUSING CONCERN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Actually both. In the four-team NFC West, which has today off, three teams
-- the 49ers, Los Angeles Rams and Atlanta Falcons -- are 2-3.;   The surprise
is the New Orleans Saints, who have taken command by jumping out to a 5-0
record. They are one of just three undefeated teams in the NFL.;   "We feel
really good about it," Saints inside linebacker Sam Mills said, "but it's
early right now.";   That's what the 49ers say. They have played only one
division rival and have two games with New Orleans in the second half.;  
"There are a lot of things to play out in the division," McVay said. ". . .
But to say, 'No, I'm not (concerned),' would be insane.";   Slowest start
since '82; The 49ers are off to their slowest start since 1982 -- the most
recent season in which they didn't make the playoffs -- and even then they
were just one game out of the division lead after five games. You have to go
to 1979, when the 49ers started 0-7, to find them this far out of the division
lead so early.;   The NFC West isn't the 49ers' only cause for concern. If the
playoffs were held today, two wild-card teams would come from the NFC East,
where Dallas, Philadelphia and Phoenix are 3-2, behind undefeated Washington.
Either Detroit or Chicago, both 4-1 and tied for the NFC Central lead, would
claim the other wild-card spot.;   Of course, the Saints -- who had never been
2-0 before, let alone 5-0 -- could revert to their former selves and collapse.
Stranger things have happened. In 1986, the New York Jets were 10-1 -- the
best in the NFL -- but lost their final five games, finished second in the AFC
East and settled for a wild-card spot. In 1987, the San Diego Chargers were
8-1 -- the best record in the NFL -- but finished 8-7 and out of the
playoffs.;   49ers rebounded in '88; And in 1988, the 49ers were 6-5 before
they pulled themselves together and went on to win the Super Bowl. The Saints,
then 8-3 and first in the NFC West, didn't make the playoffs.;   But climbing
back to the penthouse from the cellar isn't exactly second nature to the
49ers.;   "This ballclub perhaps may have a problem dealing with whatever
adversity it faces because we haven't been on the losing end of things in a
long time," running back Spencer Tillman said. "But the fact of the matter is
we've got to adjust. . . . History has shown that teams that make it to the
big show don't have an exorbitant number of losses.";   While the 49ers might
be unaccustomed to their current position, none seems surprised by the Saints'
history-making start.;   "Those guys have been improving each year," receiver
Jerry Rice said. "I knew eventually they would come on strong.";   Saints on
same page; So did safety Dave Waymer, who spent his first 10 seasons with the
Saints before joining the 49ers last season. "They've finally got the offense
and defense working on the same page," he said.;   The Saints are No. 1 in the
NFL in defense and defense against the run. They've given up just 266 rushing
yards. New Orleans' offense is 11th in the 28-team league.;   "One of the
major ingredients of their success is that they've been injury-free," McVay
said.;   The banged-up 49ers are ranked 10th in defense but third in offense.;
  For now, the 49ers must try to ignore the division race and focus on
winning. But the games against New Orleans on Nov. 10 at the Superdome and
Dec. 1 at Candlestick loom large. Can the Saints sustain their pace until
then?;   "I hope not," Waymer said.  </TEXT>

49ERS FAVORED TO WIN ANOTHER SUPER BOWL, BUT AGAINST WHOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP FOOTBALL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The confusion and contingencies are over and the NFL playoff lineup is set with 
San Francisco the favorite to win yet another Super Bowl. The NFC is looking as 
dominant as ever, and teams like the Saints, Lions and Chiefs are poised for a 
rush into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which everything was the same and everything was different. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff favorites are familiar: The 49ers, Giants, Browns, Broncos, Rams, 
Bills and Eagles have all been there before. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a sense, the season belonged to teams like the Saints, who missed the 
playoffs but spoiled two other teams' parties, and coming teams like the 
Packers, Lions and Chiefs, all of whom can build on late-season momentum. 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme are the Falcons, Jets and perhaps even the Bears, who have 
to start from scratch. So do the Cowboys, who look like something worse than an 
expansion team after going 1-15. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, we have laid the foundation for the future," said Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer of Kansas City after turning a 4-11 team to 8-7-1. The 
Lions used Barry Sanders' dazzling legs to win their final five games and New 
Orleans unearthed little-known quarterback John Fourcade to win its final 
three. 
</P>
<P>
As for the playoffs, starting next Sunday with the wild-card games, two 11-5 
teams will meet in the NFC game when the Rams visit Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC game will involve two teams from the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's 29-21 victory over Cincinnati on Monday night not only gave the 
Vikings (10-6) the NFC Central title put knocked out the defending AFC champs 
and put Pittsburgh in the playoffs for the first time in five years. The 
Steelers will be at Houston on Sunday. Both were 9-7 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The divisional playoffs will take place the following week. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, 14-2, will be host to either the Eagles or the Vikings. The New York 
Giants, 12-4, will be at home to either the Rams or the Central winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, Denver, 11-5, will play host to the wild-card winner and Buffalo 
(9-7) will be at Cleveland, which beat Houston 24-20 Saturday night to finish 
9-6-1 and win the Central for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers will be the favorites to become the first team since Pittsburgh a 
decade ago to win two straight Super Bowls, although their path won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
They went 3-1 against the Rams, Giants and Eagles this year, splitting with Los 
Angeles and beating the Giants and Eagles. But none of those games was easy -- 
they trailed the Eagles by 11 points in the fourth quarter and needed a 
fortuitous offside penalty to beat New York after letting the Giants rally from 
a 24-7 deficit to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it would be hard to argue against any team from the NFC, 
which already has a streak of five straight Super Bowl victories and has won 
seven of nine in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, Rams, Giants and Eagles were 14-2 in games against AFC teams and the 
Eagles and Giants both beat the AFC's best, Denver, at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Saints' 41-6 win Sunday over the Colts, who could have made the 
playoffs with a victory, underscores NFC superiority. In fact, 9-7 New Orleans, 
4-0 against AFC teams, and 10-6 Washington, non-playoff teams in the NFC, would 
be strong challengers in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans may have found the answer at quarterback in Fourcade, who joined 
the Saints as a strike replacement two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old journeyman, who has played for seven teams in Canada, the USFL, 
the Arena Football League and the NFL, threw for eight touchdowns in wins over 
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Indianapolis -- the first two playoff teams, the last 
a contender. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers and Lions also made dramatic improvement in the NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, rushed for a team-record 1,470 
yards, just 10 short of the league-leading total of 1,480 by Christian Okoye of 
the Chiefs. Even more, he gave the Lions a visibility they haven't had for a 
decade, and their 7-9 record, forged on five closing wins, gives them hope for 
the future, particularly since they have strong young defensive players like 
Jerry Ball, Chris Spielman and Bennie Blades. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers went from 4-12 to 10-6 as quarterback Don Majkowski emerged as a 
two-minute quarterback to rival Joe Montana; Tim Harris became the northland's 
version of Lawrence Taylor, and Sterling Sharpe looked like the next Jerry 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"I defy anyone to tell us that they thought this is where we'd be," said Coach 
Lindy Infante, not withstanding his team's soft schedule and four one-point 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are Schottenheimer's Chiefs, led by rookie linebacker Derrick 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
They would have made the playoffs had they not been upset at home in Week 15 by 
San Diego, which won its last two to finish 6-10. The Chargers also could be -- 
well, charging -- particularly if Bobby Beathard replaces the fired Steve 
Ortmayer at general manager and makes the quick fixes he's known for. 
</P>
<P>
One problem for both: a good young quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom, there are a lot of problems, although a good young quarterback 
is one thing Dallas doesn't need -- Troy Aikman showed enough to indicate he'll 
be worth the $11 million the Cowboys paid. 
</P>
<P>
But in taking Steve Walsh, who may be traded, in the supplemental draft, they 
blew the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, and the rest of the team consists 
either of aging stars like Everson Walls and Too Tall Jones or castoffs. The 
passel of draft picks they got for Herschel Walker will help. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, 3-13, will get the first pick that Dallas doesn't have and should use 
it on Alabama linebacker Keith McCants if McCants decides to bypass his senior 
year and the league lets him in. No less a personage than Taylor calls him "the 
Lawrence Taylor of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
But the pick will be made with a new coach -- perhaps Duke's Steve Spurrier, 
perhaps an assistant like San Francisco's Mike Holmgren, Denver's Wade 
Phillips, Cincinnati's Bruce Coslet or Minnesota's Floyd Peters. A long-shot -- 
McCants' college coach, Bill Curry, who recently turned down a long-term 
extension of his contract,. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bears? 
</P>
<P>
After five straight NFC Central titles, they went from 4-0 to 6-10, losing 
their final six games as injuries and age destroyed one of the decade's top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka will stay on for one more year and he probably needs a quarterback, 
for starters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we're that bad a team," he said after Sunday's 26-0 loss in 
San Francisco. "Although after today, I guess you have to believe that."

<DESCRIPT>  PLAYOFF; PLANNING; END; PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; SAN-FRANCISCO  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The ride was oh, so tantalizing, but the end was bittersweet.;   An eight-year
streak of consecutive postseason appearances for the 49ers came to a cruel
close Monday night, but not by their hands. The uncooperative Los Angeles
Raiders' failure to beat the slumping Saints in New Orleans eliminated the 9-6
49ers from the playoffs for the first time since 1982.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  IT'S OVER FOR THE 49ERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 16  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Saints' overwhelming 27-0 victory -- their first in five games --
clinched at least a wild-card playoff berth for them but also knocked the 9-6
Philadelphia Eagles out of the playoffs.;   Had the 49ers sneaked in this
season, they would have tied a record set by the Dallas Cowboys, who made the
playoffs nine consecutive seasons. But an injury-influenced 4-6 start made the
49ers' climb toward that feat a difficult, and ultimately unsuccessful one.;  
Raiders contempt, it seems, breeds 49ers unfamiliarity.;   Other than players
acquired through trades or free agency, no 49er other than quarterback Joe
Montana has known a season that didn't include a playoff game.;   "It's a
strange feeling right now, definitely," linebacker Mike Walter said by
telephone as he watched the final minutes of the Saints-Raiders game at home.
"But really, we have no one to blame but ourselves.";   For Walter, this will
be the first time in his nine-year NFL career that he will not play in a
postseason game. He came to the 49ers after spending his rookie year in 1983
with the Cowboys, who claimed a wild-card berth that season.;   Since then,
he's played in four NFC championship games and picked up three Super Bowl
championship rings. But this season will end at 16 games, bringing about an
early vacation and plenty of time to reflect on what might have been.;   "It's
no one's fault but our own," Walter said. "We didn't do what we had to do
early in the season, and we waited too long to turn it around. There was a
time, when we were 4-6, that we knew we had to win five in a row to even have
a chance, and we did that. But the things we needed to happen didn't.";   That
would be the following: The Falcons, Lions and Cowboys had to lose Sunday. But
they combined for a victory sweep, locking up three critical playoff berths
and leaving the final NFC spot for the 49ers, Eagles and Saints to fight
over.;   The 49ers desperately needed a Raiders victory Monday night, to drop
the Saints to 9-6.;   "It just didn't happen," fullback Harry Sydney said by
telephone from his Sunnyvale home. The game was ticking down to its bitter
finale, and Sydney was watching his playoff hopes go down with the Raiders'
defeat.;   "I just walked in the house, but from what I understand the Raiders
didn't play worth a damn," he said. "But it shouldn't have ever come down to
this.";   Led by third-string quarterback Steve Bono, the 49ers put together a
valiant streak of five consecutive victories to keep themselves in playoff
contention . . .;   "Yeah, after we messed up," Sydney said. "We should have
done that earlier in the season. It's unfortunate, but it's part of the
business.";   The 49ers coaches, at the team's headquarters busy drawing up
their game plan for Monday night's finale against the Chicago Bears at
Candlestick Park, huddled around a communal television during the early part
of the game, running backs Coach Ray Sherman said.;   "But after a while, we
all started to drift off to watch on our own," he said. "I know I did. It was
hard to watch. It just wasn't in the cards for us this year. It makes you
think back to earlier in the season, about those couple of games we should
have won but didn't.;   "I think the thing now is to focus on winning this
last one so that everyone finishes on a high note, and we have something we
can hold onto going into next season."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  When Ray Handley and George Seifert shared an office as assistant coaches at
Stanford a dozen years ago, little did they dream they'd share unique places
in NFL history.;   But Handley went into Monday night's game between his
Giants and Seifert's 49ers trying to do what only Seifert has done before him
-- take over a Super Bowl winner and bring it another championship.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HANDLEY INHERITS CHALLENGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Giants 16, 49ers 14  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Handley became coach of the Giants when Bill Parcells resigned on May 15, 3
1/2 months after he coached them to their second Super Bowl title. Handley had
never been a head coach above the high school level -- his last opening game
was 24 years ago, when his Sparks High School team from Nevada lost to
Herling, Calif.;   "I think the score was 8-6," he says.;   Now, in his first
head coaching job since then, the Giants met the 49ers in what has become a
classic NFL rivalry. The 49ers beat the Giants 7-3 last year in the
highest-rated regular-season NFL game in history, then New York won 15-13 in
the NFC championship game. Monday, the Giants won 16-14.;   Seifert was in a
similar position two years ago, when he took over the 49ers after Bill Walsh
stepped down. Now, both Walsh and Parcells are working for NBC as television
becomes a retirement home for NFL coaching stars.;   Like Seifert, Handley can
go nowhere but down. Seifert simply tread water when he led the 49ers to their
second straight NFL title, the first team to repeat in a decade.;   "The only
pressure on me is to be ready," Handley says. "If I'm ready, it's the most I
can do.";   To do that, the 46-year-old former running backs coach and
offensive coordinator spent Sunday playing the game in his mind. It was visual
chess for a man who has been banned from Nevada casinos as a card counter.;  
A year ago, Handley hardly thought he'd be in this position.;   He was ready
for a career change -- law. He was accepted at George Washington University
Law School when Parcells promoted him to offensive coordinator, a post that
put him in position to get the top spot.;   But Handley has already shown he's
his own man when he named Jeff Hostetler, who led the Giants to the Super
Bowl, to be his starting quarterback over Phil Simms. Simms was the 10-year
starter who missed the playoffs with a foot injury. Most people around the
Giants think Parcells would have chosen Simms.;   That's not an easy decision,
says Seifert.;   "You always think in terms of continuity," Seifert says.
"It's the organization that wins, not just the coach. When I took over we had
an excellent organization that gave the coach excellent support. So do the
Giants."  </TEXT>

Non-transferable, prepaid certificates would be presented in the Super Bowl
city only, within three days of the Super Bowl, and scalping there would be
monitored by the NFL and scalped tickets voided.";    David Villescaz,;
Woodland;    "I believe that the best way, being that the Niners have gone to
the Super Bowl four times already, would be to eliminate the people who have
gone to the Super Bowls already, whose names have been drawn already, at least
the ones who have gone twice, and that would leave a better chance for some of
the fans who haven't gone."; -- Hector Flores; San Jose;    "I think the
season-ticket holder gets first crack, period. Then a percentage goes to each

<P>
Of the many things it takes to win a National Football League championship, one 
of the most important is superior coaching. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed as obvious this winter as it has for most of the 1980s, in which 
two teams have won 5 of the last 8 Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
They are the San Francisco 49ers, coached by Bill Walsh, and the Washington 
Redskins, coached by Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Although no champion has been able to win in successive years in a decade of 
parity, the 49ers and Redskins have both made the Super Bowl 3 times since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
No other team in that spell has been there more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a decade in which either Walsh or Gibbs usually had his players 
peaking at just the right time to sweep the 3-game playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's 1981 team made the first sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gibbs' 1982 team won it. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Walsh's 1984 team. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gibbs' 1987 team. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's Super Bowl here, Walsh's 1988 National Conference champions made it 
3 for the '80s, coming from behind in the fourth quarter to beat the Cincinnati 
Bengals with a 92-yard drive, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
For the NFL, it was a season in which the Buffalo Bills peaked on Nov. 14, when 
they won their 11th straight, after which they finished 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals also peaked at mid-season. Their pass offense didn't do much after 
Thanksgiving, although, by then, Boomer Esiason had the momentum to earn 
all-pro. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were 6-5 on Nov. 21. They improved after that, peaking in January for 
the third time in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain it Monday, Walsh said: "We lighten up the workload later in 
the season. Some frustrated teams start to work harder -- too hard." 
</P>
<P>
But that can't be more than a partial answer. The real answer has to be Walsh's 
secret. And Gibbs'. 
</P>
<P>
The only visible thing is the result. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth straight Super Bowl triumph for the National Conference, but 
the first in years that wasn't a blowout. Is the AFC beginning to send up 
tougher champions? 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem so. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers just couldn't get started this time. 
</P>
<P>
They drove repeatedly through the Cincinnati defense but mixed in so many 
misplays with their big plays that they scored only a field goal in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, thankful for the reprieve, took the second-half kickoff and made a 
game of it. 
</P>
<P>
So will Super Bowl XXIII be remembered for the 49ers' mediocre performance in 
the first 3 quarters or for the brilliance of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger 
Craig and their sidemen in the fourth quarter? 
</P>
<P>
The history of these games suggests that only the glitter is remembered. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most memorable of all NFL title matches was won by the Baltimore 
Colts over the New York Giants in 1958 in sudden-death overtime, 23-17. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the era of television, it was the game that led the NFL to national 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
And it was as full of misplays as Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
What's remembered, however, is the glitter of John Unitas, who guided the Colts 
to victory with two key drives -- first in the fourth quarter, then in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
What's remembered are comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between Walsh and, at the moment, other coaches, seems to be the 
skill that he has developed as a talent scout. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, General Manager Bobby Beathard is in charge of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
On other NFL clubs, the chief of personnel is sometimes a draft specialist, 
sometimes a coach, sometimes a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
But few get Walsh's results. In part this is because, as both coach and chief 
scout, he is uniquely in position to bring in just the players who best fit his 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't all the best in college," Jerry Rice said. "But Bill saw something 
in all of us that he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me in like a son, and developed me into the player I am." 
</P>
<P>
Rice was a first draft choice of the 49ers, as was Pro Bowl safety Ronnie Lott. 
But most of Walsh's starters were second- or third-round choices. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was a third. Roger Craig was a second. Fullback Tom Rathman was a 
third, as was John Taylor, the wide receiver who scored the winning touchdown 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A second-round choice has to be passed over by 28 personnel departments in the 
first round, and, usually, by a few in the second. A third-round choice is 
passed over at least 56 times. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, in other words, have proven that high choices can be overrated as a 
championship precondition. 
</P>
<P>
It can be a cop-out to say, as many have said, "We've won so much that we've 
been drafting too low to keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
Championship players can be found in the second and third rounds, and lower, 
for those who have the skill to find them.

<LEADPARA>  It might be one of the greatest contradictions in professional football. Teams
scratch and claw to win their division, which can mean an extra week off
before their first playoff game.;    But it's a perk that many coaches
consider fraught with potential disaster.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GOOD BYE, OR GOODBYE?
SOMETIMES AN EXTRA WEEK OFF HELPS CAUSE AN
EARLY EXIT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NFL Playoffs
Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For a team that is limping into the playoffs, there might be nothing better
than a bye. But for a healthy team, there might be nothing worse.;    With the
49ers nursing an array of injuries, Coach George Seifert regards their
two-week break entering this season's playoffs as an unequivocal blessing. But
the time spent getting healthy also can knock a team out of sync and dull its
competitive edge.;    "The single benefit to a football player and a football
team is the rest, if you're injured," said Steve Ortmayer, the special-teams
coach and football operations director of the 1980 Raiders, the only wild-card
team to win a Super Bowl. "If you don't need to heal, there's no particular
advantage in having the extra week. It breaks your routine, and anything that
breaks that routine is bad, especially in anything as regimented as football.
Any break from the routine is a distraction.";    Perhaps no one is more aware
of the ticking bomb posed by an extra week than former 49ers Coach Bill Walsh,
a man who relished the chance to tune a team for postseason battle. In 1987,
the Niners rolled into the playoffs on a six-game winning streak that included
a season-ending 48-0 demolition of the Los Angeles Rams. Two weeks later, they
were knocked out of the playoffs, 36-24, by the Minnesota Vikings.;    "The
bye week is an absolute advantage," Walsh said. "There are a lot of benefits
-- if handled correctly. If mishandled, as we may have done in '87, it can
cause all sorts of problems.";    In the 49ers' case, Walsh worked the team
hard, hoping to hone it to razor sharpness.;    "I think we worked too hard
and never completely recovered," Walsh said. "Leading up to our previous Super
Bowls, we had worked hard and it did have a positive effect. But we learned in
'87 that right after the season might be the time to ease up rather than work
harder. You're not going to improve measurably at that point in the season."; 
  There may be no way of improving, but there's plenty of time for a team to
dwell on how it might, and introspection can quickly lead to self-doubts.;   
Pats didn't miss bye;  New England Patriots General Manager Pat Sullivan
credited the Patriots' '85 run to Super Bowl XX to the absence of a bye. And
he blamed their subsequent humiliation in that game -- a 46-10 loss to the
Chicago Bears -- to the scrutiny an extra week allows. For the wild-card
Patriots, the two-week Super Bowl lag was their first that season.;    "The
media spends that first week looking at your team, and players read all that.
The focus is much more intense," Sullivan said. "I think, that by getting
right at it and playing, the focus is on your opponent and not yourself.";   
There's also the risk of relaxing that first week without the pressure of an
upcoming game.;    "I would much rather have it like you do all season long,
playing every weekend," said former Coach Hank Stram, who led the Kansas City
Chiefs to appearances in Super Bowls I and IV. "If you're not careful, you
crawl back into the rocking chair and get into a comfort zone. The continuity
is better.";    No time to kick back;  Kicking back the first week can be
particularly enticing if a team spent the final weeks of the season battling
for a division title. A title automatically meant a bye from the 1978 season
through the 1989 season. But with the addition of a third wild-card team in
each conference this season, only two of the three division winners in each
conference received a bye.;    "A lot of it depends on how much pressure you
were going through to get to the playoffs," Sullivan said. "There's that risk
of being so happy to get there that the goal to go further slips.";    So
what's a coach to do? Work the team hard and risk sending his players into
that first game drained? Or let his players relax, and risk having their
competitive fire go out?;    The challenge is finding a happy medium.;    "I
think you just keep them busy enough in short bursts," Walsh said. "You don't
have to keep them on the practice field, but you can have meetings. Then it's
up to the athletes.";    But the coaches aren't the only ones tempted to use
the extra time to become suddenly much better. Players are also capable of
burning themselves out, which is why Buffalo Bills Coach Marv Levy gave his
players Monday and Tuesday off last week and stressed that they not do
anything relating to football or training.;    "We told them not to come in at
all," Levy told Buffalo reporters.;    Shula would take one;  Asked to choose
between a bye week or finishing second during the regular season, Miami
Dolphins Coach Don Shula would still prefer having a successful season.;   
"I'd love to have a bye week right now," Shula said last week, before the
Dolphins beat Kansas City 17-16 Saturday, "because that would mean we won in
Buffalo.";    Stram might have never admitted something like that. The
overriding responsibility of a coach, as he saw it, was to convince his
players that whatever their playoff schedule is at the end of the season, it's
exactly what they needed.;    To Stram, playing on the first weekend of the
playoffs was ideal. But a bye wouldn't have been bad, either.;    "You have to
have it set in your own mind that whatever the schedule demands, it's the best
possible situation," he said. "You have to use it as a positive motivation for
your players.;    "You would say, 'We're very fortunate to have a week off,
because . . . ' If it was a negative, you turned it into a positive somehow.";
 IS A FIRST-ROUND BYE AN ADVANTAGE?;    Earning a first-round bye in the NFL
playoffs has not always guaranteed a team's success in its first game, despite
having two weeks instead of one to prepare.;    TWO TEAMS THAT HAD THE BYE AND
WISHED THEY DIDN'T;    (box) 1987 49ERS: Ended season on a six-game winning
streak, lost to Minnesota in divisional playoff 36-24.;    (box) 1986 BEARS:
Ended season on seven-game winning streak, lost to Washington in divisional
playoff 21-17.;    TWO TEAMS THAT DIDN'T HAVE A BYE AND DIDN'T MIND;    (box)
1980 RAIDERS: Finished second in AFC West but defeated Houston in first round
27-7, Cleveland in divisional playoff 14-12, San Diego in the AFC championship
34-27, and Philadelphia in Super Bowl XV 27-10.;    (box) 1985 PATRIOTS:
Finished tied for second in AFC East but defeated New York Jets in first round
26-14, Raiders in divisional playoff 27-20 and Miami in AFC championship
31-14, before losing to Chicago in Super Bowl XX 46-10.;    TWO TEAMS THAT
EARNED THE BYE AND BENEFITED BY IT;    (box) 1985 BEARS: After finishing the
regular season 15-1, the Bears bolted from the two-week layoff to clobber the
New York Giants in the divisional playoff 21-0, the Los Angeles Rams in the
NFC championship 24-0, and New England in the Super Bowl.;    (box) 1979
STEELERS: After losing twice in the final five weeks of the season, the
Steelers came out to defeat their three playoff opponents by an aggregate
score of 92-46 and take their second consecutive Super Bowl.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers, those Nanooks of the north (California), cut through 
frost-biting winds and teeth-chattering reputations to put an end to a few 
myths and the Chicago Bears on Sunday, winning the National Football Conference 
title with a chilling, if not thrilling, 28-3 win at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
The team that won the title here did it in the face of 29-m.p.h. winds and 
temperatures that dipped to a wind-chill factor of minus-26 degrees, freezing 
the sweat on players' faces. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first quarter, my feet were frozen," 49er defensive end Larry 
Roberts said. "I couldn't feel my feet." 
</P>
<P>
And it figured. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers came east with images as wine tasters of football, admirers of fine 
food and finesse offense. They lugged some 1,500 pounds of cold-weather 
equipment to Chicago -- rubber-soled shoes, anti-cold creams, bun warmers. 
</P>
<P>
They came east with history's deck stacked against them. The 49ers hadn't won a 
road playoff game in 18 years. No NFC team had won a title on the road since 
the 1979 season. 
</P>
<P>
But figuring perhaps they were the better team, the 49ers came anyway, and 
warmed themselves by hurdling through the Chicago defense, trouncing the Bears 
on their field, in what was supposed to be Bear weather. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're so tough," 49er cornerback Tim McKyer was saying afterward, "why 
did all that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
What happens next is the 49ers, in a rematch of the 1982 Super Bowl, will face 
the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl Jan. 22 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami climate will be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the 49ers' feet were most certainly cold Sunday, it didn't mean 
they jumped into the game with cold feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring thermometers and numbing limbs, the 49ers stuck to their game plan, 
the first 25 plays of which were scripted the night before, as always. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of running on a frozen field, which is the conventional wisdom, San 
Francisco came at the Bears with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. It was wisdom of 
another kind. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy took the Bears by surprise, and even a few 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me," Roberts said. "I didn't expect us to move the ball on offense. 
I thought it would be a 7-6 game, or 10-9 like last time. But we moved the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Move it they did, scoring with 3:18 left in the first quarter when Montana 
fired in the right flat for Rice, who broke free as Bear corner Mike Richardson 
collided with safety Todd Krumm. Rice raced 61 yards untouched for the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe told me the ball might not be right where I wanted it to be, and I would 
have to make a play on it," Rice said. "And I did." 
</P>
<P>
If Montana was having trouble with the wind, it wasn't apparent. He teamed with 
Rice again in the second quarter, reading a Chicago blitz and dumping the ball 
to Rice over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Montana called this a "hot read," meaning he was to read the blitz and look for 
the tight end, John Frank. Frank wasn't open, but Rice had broken free of 
cornerback Vestee Jackson, made the catch in open field and then cruised for 
the touchdown, a 27-yard play. It helped put the 49ers up, 14-0, with 7:25 left 
in the half, a lead that seemed commanding given the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Working in almost unbearable conditions, Montana seemed undaunted by the winds 
or Bear defense. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon, who wore gloves but lacked any touch, 
Montana threw with a bare hand and uncanny accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have been his greatest game, under the conditions," 49er Coach Bill 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Montana almost shrugged off the conditions and claimed he actually 
had a "good feel of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
By the half, he had completed 9 of 15 passes for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
McMahon struggled. Through the first 30 minutes, he threw for 94 yards, and his 
one interception, by 49er safety Jeff Fuller, set up San Francisco's second 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Montana is a man of few words and little emotion, but the victory obviously was 
one of the biggest of his storied career. It was a crowning finish to a season 
in which Montana had outlasted a quarterback controversy with Steve Young and 
lingering questions about whether he was fit. Walsh had even sent Montana to 
the bench on occasion this year, citing injuries and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel I was ever hurt," Montana said. "Bill felt I was, and he has the 
right to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
All that seemed so far away from Soldier Field and Sunday's victory, but it 
seemed important to remember there was a time this season when the 49ers were 
6-5 and Montana's career was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We all had something to prove," Montana said, not wishing to make this a 
personal vindication. "I never gave up. My wife kept me in line and kept my 
spirits up." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's performance -- 17-of-27 passing for 288 yards and 3 touchdowns -- 
will be remembered far longer than the one turned in by his offensive line, 
which kept Montana frost-free most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The vaunted Bears' pass rush disappeared into the cone of silence formed around 
Montana, who was provided enough time to pick the Bears apart. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bears blitzed -- and they did often -- the 49ers' line picked up the 
rusher, exposing Chicago's cornerbacks to one-on-one coverage against Rice. 
</P>
<P>
It was a defensive strategy unappreciated by the Bears' Jackson, who claimed he 
didn't have the footing to stay with Rice. Does anyone ever? 
</P>
<P>
The Bears' defense was left reeling. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Mike 
Singletary, the Bears' menace of the midway, was seemingly lost in the cold 
backdrop.

"There was no one around the guy," Singletary complained about the pass rush. 
"It makes it very tough. We're supposed to play like professionals on every 
down, and it doesn't make any difference how good of game someone else has, our 
game should be just as good. . . . If I sound frustrated, I am frustrated. If I 
sound mad, I am mad." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco pushed and picked and pestered the Bears' defense to no end, 
taking over after the third-quarter kickoff and marching 78 yards on 13 plays 
for a touchdown that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who finished with 5 catches for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns, set up the 
score with a 12-yard reception down to the Bear 5-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, Montana went for the jugular, floating a lob pass for Rice in 
the end zone's right corner. Rice made an outstretched stab at the ball, but it 
was ruled he didn't have control when he and the ball hit the ground 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief instant-replay stink, Montana calmly set up again and hit Frank 
for the touchdown, putting the 49ers up, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco used up 5:27 on the drive, though it seemed an eternity for 
McMahon and the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Those 49ers who had chased McMahon before claimed he wasn't the same 
quarterback Sunday, lacking the mobility to get him out of trouble. McMahon 
made an appearance in last week's victory over Philadelphia, but had 
essentially been out since Oct. 30 with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to stare at their receivers," 49er safety Fuller said. "It's worked 
for them in the past, partially because he was a better runner then and could 
get out of the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Michael Carter noticed the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he was uncomfortable out there," he said of McMahon. "He always had 
someone chasing him and he could never set up to pass." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak, who completed 6 of 12 passes for 55 yards, replaced McMahon in 
the fourth quarter, the game having long been decided. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers got their fourth touchdown when Tom Rathman rushed in from 4 yards 
out with 6:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
All the Bears had to show for the day was a Kevin Butler field goal and some 
frozen memories. 
</P>
<P>
Rathman, who tried to make light of the weather afterward, claiming he had been 
well-prepared at Nebraska, soon confessed to the Big Lie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was freezing out there, to tell you the truth," Rathman said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, frostbite never hurts as much when you win. 
</P>

San Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. said afterward he wasn't sure whether 
his coach, Bill Walsh, would retire after the season. "I don't know," DeBartolo 
said. "He might. It's up to him." He added that even if Walsh retired, he would 
remain with the organization in some capacity. "Bill's got a year on his 
contract and I'd like him to fulfill it," DeBartolo said. "But he can coach as 
long as he likes."

FIRST 4 CATCHES ACCOUNT FOR 120 YARDS, 2 TDS  </HEADLINE>

contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "We are playing our best football right now, and I think we exemplified
that out there tonight," Rice said.;   Rice -- who was conspicuously absent
from both the Associated Press All-Pro first and second teams, which were
announced Monday -- also passed the 9,000 yards receiving mark. He is 11th on
the NFL's all-time list. Charley Taylor, who is 10th, had 9,110 yards. Steve
Largent tops the list with 13,089 yards. The two other active players on the
list are James Lofton (13,035 yards) and Art Monk (10,984 yards).;   Rice --
making his 87th consecutive start Monday night -- has caught a pass in 95
consecutive games, a steak dating to the 14th game of the 1985 season.; THE
BALLOTS ARE IN: The fifth annual poll of 49ers beat writers ran Sunday in the
Peninsula Times Tribune.;   The writers selected Steve Bono as the team's most
valuable player, over John Taylor. Bono also won the biggest surprise.;   Rice
and John Taylor collected their share of awards. Rice was named most
competitive. Taylor was voted best athlete and Mr. Uncooperative, and the two
receivers tied for Fastest 49er.;   Cornerback Merton Hanks was voted rookie
of the year. Other opinions voiced: Tom Rathman, the funniest; Spencer
Tillman, the most intelligent, most likely to succeed, and Mr. Nice Guy;
Johnnie Jackson, the biggest disappointment; Ted Washington, the worst
interview and the most boring; Steve Wallace, the best interview; Jim Burt,
the slowest 49er; and Harry Sydney replaced Ronnie Lott as the hardest
hitter.; MINI-BEARS AT CANDLESTICK: The curse of the 'Stick is alive and well
for the Bears. The last time they won at Candlestick was in 1985, when they
beat the 49ers 26-10.;   Since then, Bears are 0-3 at Candlestick. But Monday,
the Bears at least managed to break their scoreless streak during Bay Area
visits. In 1987, the Bears were blown out 41-0 in San Francisco, and in 1989
they lost 26-0.; FIRST-HALF PASSERS: The last time the 49ers were on Monday
night football -- against the Los Angeles Rams -- Bono went crazy in the first
half, passing for 274 yards (14 of 26 pass attempts) and one touchdown.
Monday, Young -- making his first start since Nov. 3 -- outdid Bono,
completing 16 of 22 passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns.; ADD YOUNG:
Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, was at the game, watching his embattled
client. Steinberg remarked on what an unlikely season Young has endured,
finally replacing Joe Montana only to be overshadowed by Bono later in the
season.;   "We've gone through every situation imaginable with Joe (Montana),
but we never expected the Steve Bono factor," Steinberg said.; HOLMGREN PLAYS
IT COY: Next to former Giants Coach Bill Parcells, 49ers offensive coordinator
Mike Holmgren gets the most mention when potential head-coaching replacements
are discussed around the league. He's said to be on the short list in at least
four places, including San Diego, where Dan Henning lost his Chargers job
Monday.;   Asked if he would be back with the 49ers next season, Holmgren
said, "I'll be back tomorrow."; ETC.: Tight end Brent Jones was asked who he
thinks will be in Super Bowl XXVI. "I don't see anyone challenging Washington
and Buffalo," he said. "But I would have liked to have seen us try." . . . Don
Griffin's 99-yard fumble return for a touchdown was the second-longest in NFL
history behind Jack Tatum's 104-yarder vs. Green Bay in 1972. . . . Rice
finished the season with 1,081 receiving yards and Taylor had 1,011, making
them the fourth pair of receivers to go over 1,000 yards receiving for a
single team. Houston, Washington and Miami also had two receivers combine for
over 2,000 receiving yards. Between them, Rice and Taylor were responsible for
23 of the 49ers' 50 touchdowns this season.  </TEXT>

GAME OF PASSION, WITHOUT MEANING;

<P>
RAMS: THE 49ERS ARE UNBEATEN AND CAN CLINCH NFC WEST TITLE WITH VICTORY. THEIR 
TRADITIONAL RIVAL IS 3-7 AND PLAYING THAT WAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Throw out that nasty 3-7 record, which the Rams surely will volunteer to do, 
and this could be a decent football game. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're at it, throw out those four Super Bowl rings, and Joe Montana 
hasn't done anything but film a few thousand commercials. 
</P>
<P>
It's temporary selective amnesia time in the Bay Area. The San Francisco 49ers 
want to forget that they are 10-0 and about to play a dreadful football team. 
The Rams simply want to forget that in 1990 they are a dreadful football team. 
</P>
<P>
This is still one of the most passionate rivalries in the NFL, and so what if 
the Rams' chances of victory are about as relevant to the playoff race as Coach 
John Robinson's choice of game garb? These teams have waited months for this. 
Relevance is nothing compared to sheer intra-state dislike. 
</P>
<P>
"You never forget the times you lost against these guys," said Ram defensive 
end Doug Reed, who has lost his share, among them the Rams' 30-3 NFC 
championship game defeat last year, to the 49ers. "They're arrogant, their fans 
are probably the nastiest fans in the world. And we're down right now but we're 
not out." 
</P>
<P>
Four Super Bowl titles, the last two in succession, could give a team reason to 
be a little cocky. The 49ers are 24-1 since losing to the Rams at Candlestick 
Park early last season and are barreling down their schedule with a realistic 
shot at a perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
As San Francisco inside linebacker Matt Millen said: "I have yet to run across 
a 10-0 team that wasn't playing well." He could probably have added: "Or a 3-7 
team that wasn't playing poorly." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams, who -- if you throw out the championship game -- have beaten the 
49ers the last two times at Candlestick, aren't quite in the mood to be 
reminded of such things. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it's going to be a physical football game, no matter what," Reed 
said. "And when we go down, we're going to go down hard and there's going to be 
a lot of people sore." 
</P>
<P>
While the Rams are whipping themselves up to find meaning in this meaningless 
season, the 49ers are just trying to stay on balance. Already the nation's 
attention is focused on next week, when the New York Giants, also 10-0, come to 
San Francisco for a Monday night super team summit. 
</P>
<P>
So is it hard to feel as intense about a game with the suddenly sad-sack Rams 
when the 49ers are used to squaring off with their Southern California rivals 
for division titles? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but at the same time, when Los Angeles comes up here to play this 
ballgame, it will be as if it's for the world's championship, I'm sure," 49er 
Coach George Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they've been such tough games year in and year out. Los Angeles 
wants to beat us, probably in the absolute worst way, and we don't want to 
become embarrassed. So really, the fact of the playoffs or division 
championship or anything, it really almost is a side issue right now." 
</P>
<P>
It really almost has to be a side issue, because the Rams have been 
mathematically eliminated from the division race and because the 49ers have 
logically eliminated about everybody else. A victory by San Francisco would 
clinch the NFC West title. 
</P>
<P>
But Seifert does have reason to be concerned, if only because of the 49ers' 
four losses in their last 38 games, two have been to the Rams. So when they 
lose, it's a good bet it's to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the 49ers probably rank first over my time as the best team in the 
league in terms of number of wins," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "We rank 
fifth. (In) number of times getting into the playoffs, we rank second. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're a good team. And over the period of years, we are. If you took those 
seven years going into this year, we're one of the better teams. We play them 
twice, and we play them good." 
</P>
<P>
But competing with the 49ers is something totally different from beating them, 
as they have proved time and again this season. The 49ers haven't blown the 
league away, just played well enough to go 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
And as always, the man who leads them is Montana, who seems to enjoy strafing 
the Rams. In the 21 games Montana has played against the Rams, he has thrown 
for 5,178 yards (246.6 a game) and 34 touchdowns while completing 65.3% of his 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed more passes, played more games and thrown more passes for more 
yards and more touchdowns against the Rams than any other quarterback, by far. 
And you thought you were just imagining it. 
</P>
<P>
Montana also happens to lead the NFC in pass yardage this season, and already 
has thrown for more than 3,000 yards for the seventh time in his career. 
Against the Rams' next-to-last pass defense, Montana's next-to-first pass 
offense should find some openings. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also are playing pretty mean defense, ranking No. 7 overall and No. 1 
against the rush. But they have been vulnerable against the pass, having 
allowed 274.8 yards a game. Blitzing linebacker Charles Haley is their 
point-man, and he leads the NFC with 12 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, through most of the year the 49ers play close games," Robinson said. 
"The 49ers play a lot of games where the other guy is in it until the end. A 
year ago, it was the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The season's all over and they kill Minnesota and they kill us and then Denver 
(in the playoffs), and you think, 'Wow! They kill everybody.' That's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson is 5-10 against the 49ers. 49er Coach George Seifert is 
27-2 overall, 2-1 against Robinson's Rams. . . . Ram quarterback Jim Everett 
has played seven games against San Francisco and never has passed for more than 
250 yards. . . . The Rams have been outscored in the fourth quarter this 
season, 81-37.

49ERS MAKING ANOTHER RUN AT RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH IGNITED ITS GROUND GAME LAST WEEK, TRIES TO AVENGE 
ITS ONLY DEFEAT TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Having rediscovered their running game, their zest for late-season charges and 
their ability to rely on Joe Montana in clutch situations, the San Francisco 
49ers get a chance on prime-time television to rediscover a way to beat the 
Rams, the team that wrecked their try for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the 49ers come to their home-away-from-home, Anaheim Stadium (where 
Montana is 8-0 in games he has started), with a 12-1 record and the vivid 
recollections of their 28-17 loss to the Rams at Candlestick Park three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Lott, their Pro Bowl safety and emotional bonfire, injured his knees two 
weeks ago and could require surgery that would put him out for the season. But 
the 49ers' machine just rolls on, popping new bodies into the void and eager to 
banish all thoughts of 1990's only blemish. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for really the first time all season, the 49ers cranked out a 
powerful running attack in their overtime defeat of the Cincinnati Bengals, 
piling up more than 200 yards and re-energizing the battered body of tailback 
Roger Craig, who gained 97 of his own. Of course, they won it in the end on a 
couple of Montana-led late-game drives, but what's the news in that? 
</P>
<P>
Before last week, the 49er offense was strictly airborne, a method that crashed 
and burned when the Rams played a four-safety "big nickel" defense most of the 
game, switched their coverages relentlessly to confuse Montana, clogged up the 
passing lanes and dared the 49ers to run. 
</P>
<P>
After last week, the 49ers are running, and the Rams know that they'll have to 
do something vastly different this week in order to keep the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the (Cincinnati) ballgame, and that's what the 49ers do extremely 
well," said Fritz Shurmer, the Rams' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"They win. They find a way to win the ballgame, whether it's last week running 
the ball 40 times for over 200 yards or it's with Joe with the ball in his 
hands on the last drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing that makes them great. Or if they've got to win one, 7-3, 
like they did (against the New York Giants), win it with their defense. That's 
what this team is. This team is a great football team that has a great capacity 
to be able to do whatever they need to do to win the football game. And if 
they've got to run 40 times to do it, they do it. And if they've got to throw 
it 50 times, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
The last time these two teams met in Anaheim, it took perhaps Montana's finest 
single-game performance ever to beat the Rams. Trailing, 24-10, going into the 
final quarter, Montana put 20 points on the board in that quarter, and passed 
for 458 yards overall to lead the 49ers to a stunning 30-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was just the latest chapter in Montana and the 49ers' tradition of 
walloping their Orange County hosts. Montana, in his eight games at Anaheim, 
has averaged 321.5 yards of passing and thrown for a total of 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why that happens," Craig said. "But we can't go off the history 
of saying we win down there all the time so it's going to be a cakewalk for us. 
No, the Rams will be fired up. And they have more incentive now to play us than 
the first time they played us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams limp into this game out of the playoff picture for the first time in 
three seasons. So, at 5-8, they are clutching at one final goal for 1990: 
</P>
<P>
Mess up the 49ers' season as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the league doesn't quite seem to be up to knocking off the two-time 
defending Super Bowl champions, who are vying with the Chicago Bears and the 
Giants for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, but another Rams' 
victory almost certainly would do away with that air of 49er invincibility. If 
the Rams can sweep the 49ers, why can't a team with a winning record? 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be great, it'd be great for us," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said. 
"Knowing that we beat them twice (with another victory tonight). I think that's 
what it's all about at this point. Beating them and playing a hell of a 
football game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, by the way, not only are quite comfortable in Anaheim Stadium, but 
everywhere: they have won 16 consecutive road games dating to 1988, and it's 18 
in a row if you count their two neutral site Super Bowl victories in that span. 
</P>
<P>
So don't ask Ram Coach John Robinson why the 49ers play so well in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no explanation for it," Robinson said. "I just don't know. That 
question has been asked, (but) I have no idea. The 49ers have played well in a 
lot of stadiums, what, 18 in a row, some number that's way out there. Fabulous. 
They don't lose on the road." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Robinson can explain is the most underestimated part of the 49ers' 
team: Their defense. In their last meeting, the Rams piled up 350 yards against 
the 49ers, whose best defensive player, linebacker Charles Haley, was banged 
up. Haley is injury-free now and leading the NFC with 14 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have the seventh-rated defense overall and are the No. 2 defense 
against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have a great defensive team," Robinson said. "I can't imagine why 
people don't talk about what they've done. I guess people don't understand . . 
. what they've done defensively because they tend not to be individuals, they 
tend to be a group. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so much better than any other defense that I've dealt with over a 
period of time. There's been periods when other defenses have risen and such, 
but this is a consistently outstanding defense. And in big games, they play 
marvelous football. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the time . . . you look back at their defensive record, in the 
games that were really big, they were phenomenal. Sometimes the other team 
scored, but it was usually in the last quarter when they were ahead by along 
ways. It's a very impressive group." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Lott? Last week, with Lott out, veteran Dave Waymer moved over to 
free safety and Johnny Jackson started at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he's missed some games," Robinson said. "I think it's a major blow to 
them, but they're used to it. They've never lost a game with him out, so I 
think they'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert says he isn't a bit surprised that his 
former boss, Bill Walsh, is the subject of speculation about a number of 
coaching jobs. "I don't believe any of us are surprised by any of it," Seifert 
said. "He's one of the great coaches ever to coach in this game and probably 
did as fine a job as has been done as far as putting together a team and 
building it into the type of organization, along with Eddie (DeBartolo), our 
owner, as has been done over the years." . . . The Rams are 17-17 overall on 
Monday nights; the 49ers are 15-12. . . . The Rams' 5-8 record is their worst 
through 13 game since 1981, when they also started 5-8. To find a worse Ram 
record through 13 games, you have to go all the way back to 1965, when they 
started 3-10.

49ERS MAKE SUPER BOWL WORTHWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It has the look of a blowout. And the truth is, it will be a major surprise if 
it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
So is there any point in watching the Super Bowl this year? 
</P>
<P>
There is -- if you're into football in the same sense that music fans, say, 
would jump at the opportunity to catch Bruce Springsteen or the Beatles or 
Frank Sinatra or Count Basie's big band one last time at their absolute peak. 
</P>
<P>
To watch the San Francisco 49ers this winter is to see one of the best football 
teams of all time, playing at levels of efficiency, dedication and excitement 
rarely reached. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that separates the 49ers from others in football isn't their 
exceptional talent, as such -- their individual or collective talent. The thing 
that makes them different is the consistent way their talent performs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have been an aesthetic wonder. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, their quarterback, Joe Montana, who personifies everything 
the 49ers are. He is quite possibly the best ever, but that's arguable. What 
isn't really arguable is that no other quarterback ever reached and remained at 
the peak that Montana has been at this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that in a 28-team league, the 27 other teams continue to be 
gripped in a parity experience that makes them all seem pretty much alike. 
</P>
<P>
With Montana at his present level, the NFL has divided into what has the look 
of two leagues: the 49ers and all the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Overconfidence is the one thing that could theoretically beat the 49ers in 
their engagement with the Denver Broncos Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
That would be something to consider if they hadn't changed coaches between 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't going to bother them now. 
</P>
<P>
As coached by George Seifert, the 49ers appear to have been driven all season 
by an obsession to show last year's leader, Bill Walsh, they can win without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
And in Super Bowl XXIV, that may inspire them once more. 
</P>
<P>
There is no bitterness or disrespect in the unusual motivation that has kept 
the 49ers going. Some players in former years had some minor differences with 
Walsh -- as gifted, high-strung athletes often have with those in authority -- 
but they don't think of Walsh as a bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, they think of him as a great coach, a silver-haired father 
figure who took them to three Super Bowl championships in eight winters. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Daddy's gone. He can do nothing more, in person, for his big family. 
But the kids have grown up, and, now, they're determined to show the old man 
they don't need him anymore, that they can do it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
That's a powerful motivational weapon. And in a sport one part emotional, one 
part mental and one part physical, the right motivation is often the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Merely wanting to win the Super Bowl isn't enough, though. Every champion wants 
to repeat, but no one has since the Pittsburgh Steelers won in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In a parity era, what's needed is a sufficient reason to do it, and their old 
coach has given it to them. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10 years with the 49ers, Walsh brought in Montana and all the other 
talent, recruited the coaching staff, supervised the structuring of the 
defense, and designed and installed the offense they're still using. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the many who couldn't repeat in the 1980s, he probably couldn't have 
coached a Super Bowl winner himself this year. But by dropping out -- in 
Montana's prime -- Walsh has done the children one last, big favor. 
</P>
<P>
The way they're talking in Denver, they expect quarterback John Elway to win 
this time, ending the Broncos' Super Bowl losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The game's magic number is four: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the 49ers win, their four successes will match Pittsburgh's in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Denver's four losses would match Minnesota's, also in the '70s, when the 
AFC was the dominant conference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A defeat would end Denver's four-game winning streak against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are the only team San Francisco failed to beat in Walsh's 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 regular season, however, NFC playoff teams were a combined 16-4 
against the AFC, which, overall, lost the interconference series, 28-24. 
Illustrating the NFC's present power, a non-playoff NFC team, New Orleans, has 
won 12 in a row against AFC opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Broncos earned the championship of what has become the inferior 
conference, although their coach, Dan Reeves, doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We have played consistently well for 18 games," Reeves said. "So I think we 
have a chance to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Elway does give them a chance. Along with Montana, Houston's Warren Moon and 
Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham, Elway is one of the four great athletes now 
playing quarterback in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But his only reliable running back, Bobby Humphrey, a small but determined 
rookie, cracked two ribs last Sunday -- in a collision that didn't look that 
serious -- and figures to either be out or ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks and kickers can play with cracked ribs. Running backs? No way; not 
well. Not for long. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver people should cool their optimism and get ready to lose. They've had 
a big season. Their manhood doesn't depend on winning the Super Bowl. This is a 
year for them to be content with what Reeves and Elway have already 
accomplished.

<LEADPARA>  Road success had become almost second-nature to the 49ers, who entered Monday
night's season opener against the New York Giants riding an 18-game
regular-season road winning streak, dating to the 1988 season.;   But all that
ended when Matt Bahr's 35-yard field goal with five seconds remaining gave the
Giants a 16-14 victory.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GIANTS' WIN ENDS THE 49ERS' STRING OF SUCCESS ON
ROAD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Giants 16, 49ers 14; 49ers Notebook  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     By that point, the 49ers had recorded 22 consecutive victories away from
Candlestick Park, counting the 1988 NFC championship game, Super Bowl XXIII,
the 1989 New England game played at Stanford because of the earthquake and
Super Bowl XXIV.;   They had won 29 of their last 31 regular-season road games
-- 30 of 32, counting postseason victories -- dating to 1987. The loss also
ended a 16-game string of victories on artificial turf, dating to 1987 and a
seven-game streak of success in Monday night contests.; MEETING IN THE TUNNEL:
After the 49ers-Giants matchup at Candlestick last December, quarterbacks
Steve Young and Jeff Hostetler talked on the field about the frustrations of
being a backup.;   Monday night at Giants Stadium, there was another meeting
of opposing quarterbacks. But this time it was Joe Montana and Phil Simms, who
stopped and spoke in the tunnel between the locker rooms. One can only
speculate on the topic of conversation this time.; VISITOR: Former 49ers and
Giants player Jim Burt showed where his loyalties lie, standing on the 49ers
sideline with his son.;   Burt, who lives in nearby Allendale, N.J., retired
during training camp after two years with the 49ers and eight with the
Giants.;   Burt also spent Monday afternoon at the 49ers hotel, huddling part
of the time with Allan Webb, the 49ers' director of pro personnel.;   But if
the 49ers suffered an injury to one of their defensive linemen, it would not
be surprising to see Burt put on a 49ers uniform again. In 1990, retired
defensive lineman Pete Kugler visited the 49ers on the sideline during an
exhibition game in Denver. He came out of retirement a few days later.; BACK
IN ACTION: It was a 1-yard run with 6 minutes, 46 seconds remaining in the
first quarter. No big deal.;   But it was a very big deal for running back
Spencer Tillman. It was his first carry from scrimmage in a 49ers uniform,
which he has worn for two seasons. A fixture on special teams, Tillman last
carried the ball from scrimmage in 1988 when he was with Houston.; SLOPPY: The
49ers had a 5-0 record in the preseason, but they clearly didn't work out all
the kinks. They were penalized nine times for 66 yards, six penalties coming
in the first half. The Giants were flagged six times for 45 yards.; ETC.:
Former Stanford receiver Ed McCaffrey, drafted by the Giants in the third
round last spring, made his NFL debut but had no receptions. . . . Todd Bowles
was the 49ers' starting free safety, though Johnnie Jackson played in the
nickel package. . . . The 49ers had only four first downs in the first half. .
. . Ralf Mojsiejenko, who didn't exactly overwhelm the 49ers in exhibition
play, started strong with four punts for a 42.5-yard average in the first
half. But he didn't fare well in the second half and finished with a 37.8
average on six punts. . . . Simms' father died of a heart attack last week at
age 63.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>San Francisco Routs Broncos in Super Bowl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver
Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super Bowl victory ever.
   The 49ers' win in the 24th Super Bowl made them the first repeat
NFL champion in a decade and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a
pinnacle of Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries.
   San Francisco won the National Football League championship game
in 1989, 1985 and 1982. The Broncos, on the other hand, lost the
last four Super Bowl games they have played.
   San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana made five touchdown
passes, three to Jerry Rice, breaking a Super Bowl record for
touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13
straight pass completions.
   He also set five Super Bowl career records, including his third
Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and San Francisco's point
total was the most ever. Montana left the game with nearly 11
minutes to play.
   In four Super Bowls, he has thrown 11 touchdowns and no
interceptions.
   For Denver quarterback John Elway, it was a day of futility,
ending with his third Super Bowl defeat. He missed eight of his
first 10 passes and was intercepted twice and fumbled once.
   By halftime the score was 27-3. With their third loss in four
years, the Broncos have now been outscored 136-40.
   San Francisco was boringly perfect, doing more than even the
experts who made them favorites by nearly two touchdowns after a
14-2 season and a waltz through the playoffs.

49ERS GIVE BENGALS A COUPLE MORE KICKS TO WIN IN OVERTIME;

20-17 VICTORY.

<P>
It keeps happening to the Cincinnati Bengals, but they're not getting used to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's passes to Jerry Rice set up Mike Cofer's game-tying field goal 
with 57 seconds left in regulation and Cofer's kick in overtime that gave the 
San Francisco 49ers a 20-17 victory over the Bengals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' last four games against the 49ers have wound up last-minute 
losses, including the Super Bowl two years ago, when Montana starred in a 
decisive 92-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat that team," Cincinnati safety David Fulcher said. "It goes the same 
way again. We beat them and then we give it up. We've got to do something to 
stop people from doing what they do to us late in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (12-1) were trailing, 17-14, when they got the ball with 4:11 left in 
regulation. Montana passed to Rice for a 29-yard gain on the first play and 
drove them to Cofer's game-tying 23-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won the toss and took possession at their 19 at the start of 
overtime. Montana connected with Rice with passes of 14 and 17 yards to cross 
midfield, and converted a third-and-six situation with a seven-yard pass to 
Rice to help set up Cofer's game-winning 23-yard field goal two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"We play our best football when everything's on the line," said Rice, who had 
eight catches for 101 yards. "Once we got the ball, I knew we were going to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals (7-6), who seemingly took control of the AFC Central Division by 
beating Pittsburgh twice in the last three weeks, fell back into a three-way 
tie for the lead with the Steelers and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche wasn't in a mood to talk, cutting short his post-game press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have lost their last seven against the 49ers, including their 20-16 
Super Bowl defeat two years ago on Montana's pass to John Taylor with 34 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last time they met in the regular season, the Bengals failed to 
run out the clock, leaving Montana time for one play -- a scoring pass to Rice 
to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
These last-minute losses may be getting old to Wyche, but Montana, his former 
pupil, enjoyed the repeat ending. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the world of Sam," Montana said. "It's like beating your best friend. 
You know how he feels, but in a lot of cases there's nobody you like beating 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Ickey Woods' one-yard touchdown run put Cincinnati ahead, 17-14, with 12:26 
left, and the Bengals forced the 49ers to punt on their next possession. 
However, Boomer Esiason and the Cincinnati offense couldn't score again, giving 
Montana one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed 19 of 26 passes for 185 yards. On the tying and winning 
drives, he took advantage of the absence of safety Rickey Dixon, who suffered a 
broken leg in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco also revived its ground game, with Roger Craig gaining 97 yards 
in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 49ers' 17th consecutive victory on the road, extending their NFL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Esiason threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Craig Taylor on the Bengals' first 
possession, but they couldn't find the end zone again until Woods' score. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rathman's one-yard touchdown run got the 49ers even, 7-7, but the Bengals 
regained the lead on Jim Breech's 38-yard field goal in the third quarter after 
Esiason's 20-yard scoring pass to James Brooks was nullified by an illegal 
motion penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers regained the lead, 14-10, on Harry Sydney's three-yard touchdown run 
late in the third quarter.

<LEADPARA>  NEVER let it be said this column will not acknowledge that some other major
league sport could be moderately important this time of year. Therefore, since
this is an off-week in the NFC West, we feature a smattering of baseball
references.; THE LEADOFF: There have been plenty of "subway or freeway series"
in baseball, but when was the last time you heard of one in the NFL?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FEVER PITCH ABATES A WEEK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.;
NFL Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     OK, OK, so it's a trick question. Truth is, it hasn't happened. Hasn't even
been close. The regions where this could occur -- New York, Los Angeles and
the Bay Area, way back when -- have consistently failed to get their teams in
successful sync.;   Here in the Bay Area, when there used to be two
championship-caliber football teams (now there are none), the 49ers and
Raiders never could get it together. Consider that:;   (check) When the
Oakland Raiders won Super Bowls XI, XV, the 49ers finished 8-6 and 6-10,
respectively. When the Oakland Raiders played in Super Bowl II, the 49ers
finished 7-7.;   (check) When the (blech) Los Angeles Raiders won Super Bowl
XVIII, the Rams finished 9-7.;   Over the hill, when the New York Jets won the
Super Bowl after the 1968 season, the Giants finished 7-7. When the Giants won
Super Bowls XXV and XXI, the Jets finished 6-10 and 10-6, respectively.;
TODAY'S 'FOOTBALL IS BETTER' FACT: The Redskins have notched three shutouts in
their three home games this season. That's one more shutout than the Baltimore
Orioles have compiled in 80 home dates.; IN BIG D, IT'S GO SAINTS: Yes, it's
hard to believe, isn't it? Those pesky New Orleans Saints continue to win and
lead the NFC West by three games. Suffice it to say, the 49ers aren't pulling
for the Saints, but the Dallas Cowboys sure are.;   If New Orleans makes it to
the NFC title game, that 1992 No. 2 pick Dallas got from New Orleans in the
Steve Walsh deal (along with the Saints' 1991 No. 1 pick) becomes a No. 1
pick. The Cowboys would then have three first-round picks in the '92 draft --
theirs, the Saints' and Minnesota's (from the Herschel Walker deal).;
OVERHEARD: This, from right-wing Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka, on how to
sack Iraq's Saddam Hussein: "If you let the liberals of the world control it,
we wouldn't go into Alabama. But if you do what's right, we might have to go
back in there and slap him around." Peace, Mike.; EXTRA POINTS: The Raiders
are 3-2 despite the fact that they haven't scored more than 17 points in any
of their five games. . . . Raiders running back Marcus Allen figures to be
ready for the Oct. 20 game against the Rams. . . . Longtime NFL rivals Dallas
and Green Bay meet today, but it's only the first time in Milwaukee, at County
Stadium. . . . Interim Colts Coach Rick Venturi doesn't figure to keep his job
long. Word is Indy General Manager Jimmy Irsay has contacted Raiders
quarterback coach Mike White and told him that the Colts' job is his after the
season if he wants it. White, a one-time Cal coach, coached Colts quarterback
Jeff George at the University of Illinois. Early rumors of 49ers offensive
coordinator Mike Holmgren's getting a similar call persist, however. . . . The
Jets have the NFL's No. 3-ranked defense against the run, but they're 25th
against the pass.  </TEXT>

<P>
Just to remind people that 16 games is a long season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here come the Saints, Packers and Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
There go the Bucs and, to a lesser extent, the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
While the Giants, 49ers, Bears, Dolphins and Bills continue to sail along at 
the top of the NFL with a combined record of 42-3, the jockeying for secondary 
playoff positions is changing every week. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the action Sunday was on the West Coast, where the Packers handed the 
Raiders their first home loss of the Art Shell regime. The Raiders, who had won 
10 straight at the Coliseum under Shell, now are 6-3 and officially out of the 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
And the 4-5 Packers are back in the NFC wild-card race, along with the 4-5 
Saints, who have unleashed Craig (Ironhead) Heyward and the defense in two 
straight wins by a total of 56-14. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward, who had 35 yards in 11 carries in his first seven games, gained 277 
yards in 39 carries the past two weeks, including 155 yards in Sunday's 35-7 
destruction of the sliding Bucs. Tampa Bay, which started 4-2, now has lost 
four straight and has been outscored 102-23 in the last three. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Chargers, who improved to 5-5 with a 19-7 win over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is only 1 1/2 games behind the Raiders and a half-game behind the 
Chiefs in the AFC West and the difference is quarterbacking. 
</P>
<P>
Steve DeBerg of the Chiefs and Jay Schroeder of the Raiders have had 
predictable off-days the past two weeks, while the Chargers' Billy Joe Tolliver 
hasn't thrown an interception in four games (121 attempts), after throwing 
eight in the first six games. Kansas City hasn't scored an offensive touchdown 
in 10 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But the key is defense for the Chargers, who are 5-5 after a 2-5 start. In 
their first five games, they allowed 322 yards per game and were minus-four in 
turnover ratio; in their last five, they've allowed 199.8 yards and are plus-15 
in turnovers, as Burt Grossman, Lee Williams, Leslie O'Neal have all 
demonstrated Pro Bowl capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"They're as good up front as any team we've played this year," John Elway of 
Denver (3-6), another team going south fast, said of the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
23-Second Drill -- Against Green Bay last week, Joe Montana drove the 49ers to 
a touchdown in 27 seconds just before the half. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, he drove the 'Niners to within field-goal range in 23 seconds, 
throwing a 27-yard pass to Jerry Rice on the sideline with no timeouts left to 
set up Mike Cofer's last-second kick. 
</P>
<P>
One reason? 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers set Rice alone on the left side against single coverage while they 
had three receivers right. One of them was backup quarterback Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Physical -- The AFC is supposed to be the less physical conference. 
</P>
<P>
But the NFL's four leading sack teams are all from the AFC -- the Dolphins and 
Chiefs with 35 each; the Chargers and Raiders with 32.

<LEADPARA>  HERE is my theory: The spy in the eucalyptus tree last week in Santa Clara was
actually Ben Johnson, the disgraced Canadian sprinter.;    Yes, that's
correct. You see, I figure that Johnson was scouting the 49ers, trying to
decide whether he should make his next comeback race against (A) Carl Lewis,
the world's fastest human; or (B) Michael Carter, the world's fastest
300-pound wrecking ball.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NINERS' EFFORT GOOD BUT NEEDS TO BE BETTER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Memo to Ben: Better stick with Carl. You probably can beat Michael Carter
over 100 yards, but there's always the chance he might trip and fall on top of
you. And that could be a paramedical experience.;    Fortunately, such a
tragedy was averted Saturday, when Carter found himself -- don't ask how --
intercepting a pass against the Washington Redskins.;    Wait. It gets better.
The 49ers nose tackle then found  himself -- don't ask how -- trundling 61
yards to the goal line, as enormous Redskins linemen chased after him. If
parimutuel elephant racing is ever legalized, this was an exciting preview.;  
 Carter, though, won this race handily. After which he collapsed of
exhaustion.;    "When I got to the end zone, I couldn't even move or stand
up," Carter said.;    "I think Michael is still breathing hard," said Joe
Montana half an hour after the game.;    Carter's run served as a sweet
exclamation point on a 28-10 playoff victory by the 49ers that, for them,
appeared quite routine. But by this morning, all those one-liners about
Carter's run will be old news. The game tapes will be analyzed. And they will
yield the following sober conclusion:;    The 49ers must play better than they
did against Washington to win another Super Bowl. Or else.;    For your
information, this is not another of my implausible idiot theories. It is, you
should know, the trenchant opinion of 49ers linebacker Matt Millen, among
others.;    "On a scale of 1 to 10, defensively, I would rate our performance
at about a 6 today," said Millen as he sat on his locker stool. "Well, maybe
I'd give us a 10 at keeping them out of the end zone in the second half. But
it was a 6 overall in terms of giving up yardage.";    But what about the
Niners' offense? The two touchdown passes by Montana? Those were bright
moments, weren't they?;    "I think we played well in the first half," said
tight end Brent Jones. "But you can't just get up on people and sit on the
lead. You've got to put people away the way we did last year.";    "I don't
think we've played our best game yet," agreed center Jesse Sapolu. "Those
sacks we gave up before the first half ticked me off. It could have been
avoided.";    If the 49ers seem overly hard on themselves, it's only  because
they are comparing themselves to Niners of Yore. They are battling their own
legend, which can be tough.;    In their stunning blitzes through the last two
postseasons, the 49ers have won their four conference playoff games (excluding
the Super Bowl title games) by an average margin of 26 points. Measured
against that, Saturday's mere 18-point victory was a disappointment.;    And
not just artistically. As they have throughout this season, the Niners raised
as many questions in victory as other teams raise in defeat.;    For example,
despite the final result, the Redskins outgained the 49ers in offensive
yardage. In fact, the Redskins' total-yardage (441) and first-down (25) totals
were records for opposing teams against the Niners in a playoff game.;    Even
more comically, Washington quarterback Mark Rypien threw for more yards (361)
than Montana (274). And the Niners' running backs averaged just 1.9 yards per
carry.;    So. Does this mean the Niners have authentic problems? The answer
is, no more than they've had the rest of this season. And all they've got is a
15-2 record to show for it.;    The Niners played a good game Saturday, but
not a coordinated one. The offense played a close-to-perfect first half and a
not-so-perfect second half. The defense did just the reverse. But in the
situations where greatness was needed, greatness appeared.;    On defense, the
Niners tightened the screws on the Redskins' men-in-motion bells-and-whistles
offense well enough to stop them three times inside the 20-yard line. Rypien
also helped by living up to his reputation as a streaky lump of neurons. Under
 pressure, he threw two end-zone interceptions. The second one practically was
a fair catch for defender Darryl Pollard.;    On offense, Montana's two
touchdown throws were as exquisite as ever. His scoring pass to Jerry Rice was
like one of those gravity-defying rifle bullets in a Yosemite Sam cartoon. It
left Montana's gun, took a quick left turn around Bugs Bunny and two Redskins
defensive backs, then made another quick right turn directly into the hands of
Rice.;    "It looked just like Thursday at practice," quipped Millen.;    But
the 49ers haven't played their best game?;    "No, not even close," he said.; 
  An effort like Saturday's will be plenty enough to beat the Bears or Giants
next week. Both teams also feature quarterbacks who don't exactly throw the
fear of Johnny Unitas into you. (Think about it. Have you ever heard anyone
utter the phrase, 'That was a classic Jeff Hostetler two-minute drill'?);   
The Super Bowl, though, will be a different story. Against the Buffalo Bills
or Los Angeles Raiders in the Super Bowl, the Niners' defense may run into a
quarterback that does not throw fair catches. Saturday was good. The next two
weeks have to be better.; 49ERS WIN BIG -- AS USUAL; If this is January, the
49ers must be rolling to victory. Saturday's 18-point win should come as no
surprise to those familiar with the Niners' pattern in previous successful
postseasons. Here is their average victory margin in postseason games in each
of their Super Bowl seasons:; ...; Season Games Avg. margin; 1981    3

<HEADLINE>  THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR
49ERS, SEAHAWKS TRY TO KEEP PLAYOFF HOPES ALIVE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 15  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sounds as though the 49ers need a little boost to get to the playoffs. And
while we're on this subject . . .;   "We've got to win this game, the next
game, and the next game," Seattle quarterback Dave Krieg said.;   So do the
Seahawks.;   Thus the late-season scramble for wild-card playoff berths
continues at 1 p.m. today for the 49ers (7-6) and Seahawks (6-7). For one of
these clubs, the Kingdome will be remembered as the site of the last stand of
1991.;   Both must win their remaining games to stay in the hunt, though the
49ers are in somewhat better position to sneak in than Seattle.;   "We have an
outside chance, mathematically, of getting into the playoffs," said Seahawks
Coach Chuck Knox, whose job might depend on that. Seattle is in a precarious
fourth place in the AFC West and last in a six-team scramble for three AFC
wild-card spots.;   Looking for help;   A demoralizing 19-6 division loss last
week to the Kansas City Chiefs -- in which the Seattle offense failed to score
a touchdown -- might have given the Seahawks some control over their destiny.
Now they need a sweep, and a slump elsewhere in the AFC.;   "Last Sunday was a
playoff-game situation for us, and we didn't get it done," said Knox, whose
once-daunted offense is ranked 20th in the NFL, despite Krieg's tidy 69.7
completion percentage.;   Like the Seahawks, who lost some early season
heartbreakers, the 49ers wish they had hit playoff form sooner.;   "You know,
it's just a shame that it had to get to this point," 49ers linebacker Mike
Walter said. "We had some games earlier in the season that maybe we should
have won. Games like that one at Atlanta (a 39-34 loss), or the Vikings game
(a 17-14 loss).;   "Those are the ones that are killing us now. When you think
that, here we are, we've won three straight games and we're only 7-6, it makes
you wish we'd have put this together earlier in the season.";   But back then,
the 49ers were suffering through growing pains associated with the loss of
inspirational veterans Ronnie Lott (via Plan B, to the Los Angeles Raiders)
and Joe Montana (season-ending elbow surgery).;   Other differences;   The
49ers looked like a different team back in the exhibition season, too, when
they went 5-0. And one of those victories came in Seattle, when newly
designated starting quarterback Steve Young and wide receiver Jerry Rice
blistered the Seahawks for 446 yards in a 28-16 victory.;   Since that time,
Young has been lost for five weeks to a knee injury and Rice seems to have
recovered from a slightly torn knee ligament that bothered him much of the
season. The 49ers have won three consecutive games under third-string
quarterback Steve Bono.;   Meanwhile, Seattle hopes it can start up its
stalled "Ground Chuck" running game, led by the ho-hum 4.0-yard per carry
average of fullback John L. Williams.;   "We have to find a way to do
something," said the pass-happy Krieg, who has thrown more than 50 completions
apiece to Williams and wide receiver Brian Blades. "If we can't run the ball,
we have to find a way to put the ball into the end zone and get yardage and do
things like that.";   For as these playoff-hungry teams can attest, time's
a'wastin'.;   "You can't win three in a row until you win one in a row," Krieg
said. "That's what we're going to try to do this Sunday, because everybody has
a chance.;   "The 49ers have a chance. So it's going to be one of those kinds
of football games."  </TEXT>

<P>
A year after suffering his most painful pull outside of a dentist's office, 
quarterback Joe Montana was removed from the starting lineup again Sunday, sent 
to the bench with 8 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Same place, same playoff opponent, same stakes. But hardly the same ol' Joe. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the 32-year-old Montana left as conquering hero, having played a 
game with the hunger of a man who hadn't thrown a playoff touchdown pass in 4 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montana hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
But those ghosts, along with others, were finally purged from the souls of the 
San Francisco 49ers, who snapped a 3-year, first-game playoff losing streak 
with a 34-9 win over the Minnesota Vikings to advance to next week's NFC title 
game against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who would throw his first postseason scoring pass since Super Bowl 
XIX, played brilliantly early and made it stand up. Montana finished with 
scoring passes of 2, 4 and 11 yards -- all to receiver Jerry Rice, all in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
A more complete reversal of last season's loss to the Vikings is difficult to 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
It was here at Candlestick Park that Montana was breaded and deep fried in a 
playoff loss a season ago, a humbling performance that led to his second-half 
benching and the dawning of a new-age quarterback controversy with Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, before a crowd of 61,848, Montana left the game only after his work was 
done, his good name and a game's outcome having long been satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not that the 49ers were sensitive about their little run of bad luck 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The past 3 years have been glorious years," Coach Bill Walsh said, responding 
to a pointed question afterward. "I don't know where you're from. We've been to 
the playoffs every year. We haven't won the Super Bowl in 4 years. People will 
look at the negative side about that. But what other team has done more than we 
have? We have no apologies for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Especially not after Sunday, when the 49ers reversed virtually every trend from 
last season's Vikings loss. 
</P>
<P>
None was more important than the elimination of Anthony Carter from the 
Vikings' game plan. Last time, Carter cut through the 49er secondary for a 
playoff-record 227 yards with 10 catches. Sunday, Carter did not have ball 
thrown his direction in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first catch with 13:21 left in the third quarter and finished with 
3 catches for 45 yards. Viking quarterback Wade Wilson threw Carter's way just 
5 times all day. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tim McKyer, who admitted he and the boys did a pretty nice 
double-coverage blanket job on Carter, still couldn't believe the Vikings 
didn't take a chance on their home-run king. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their game plan was," McKyer said. "But I know if I was the 
coach, I would throw him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, for example, don't seem to mind how many people are covering Rice. 
Great receivers make great catches, they figure. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, of course, has been through this before with his coaching staff and 
wasn't pleased with his snubbing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Viking Coach Jerry Burns said the 49ers' heavy pass rush and double coverage 
took Carter out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything differently," Burns snapped later. "They just did it a 
hell of a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Carter basically said that Burns took him out of the game. And for Carter, 
those lonely pass routes were tough pills to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Double coverage? 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what I saw," he said. "I saw a lot of zone. They just didn't call 
my number." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Viking coaches can reach Carter at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was true, though, the 49ers' defensive front put an excessive amount of heat 
on Wilson, who sometimes had trouble getting the ball out of his own hand, let 
alone to his receivers. Wilson was sacked 6 times on the day for minus-47 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we didn't sack him today, we wanted to be in his face and get a hand 
up," 49er defensive end Larry Roberts said. "By keeping a lot of pressure on 
Wilson and playing AC (Carter) up tight, we knew we pretty much had them where 
we wanted them." 
</P>
<P>
And that, of course, was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, San Francisco's offensive line protected Montana well, much 
better than last season when the Vikings sacked him 4 times. Sunday, Montana 
was sacked once. 
</P>
<P>
Against the likes of Keith Millard and Chris Doleman and the rest of 
Minnesota's No. 1-ranked defense, that was big news. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line had a great day," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Millard, twice called for offsides, grew more frustrated as 
the day wore on. After Roger Craig's 4-yard run put the 49ers up, 28-9, with 
13:41 left, Millard sauntered over and took a shot at Montana's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, certainly not foolish enough to exchange blows, instead wagged his 
finger at Millard as he ran off the field. Millard, of course, wagged back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just the heat-of-the-moment-type thing," Montana said. "I was just 
congratulating my offensive line and got an elbow across my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Millard's face was stained only with egg. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, whose mobility this season has been hampered by various injuries, 
seemed strong and sharp Sunday, especially in the first half, when he completed 
11 of 14 passes for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Things might have been worse had the Vikings not squandered a nice 6-minute, 
12-play drive on their opening drive, settling for a 47-yard Chuck Nelson field 
goal. Minnesota's only lead of the day, 3-0, would last just minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Montana drove the 49ers 48 yards late in the quarter before finding Rice open 
for a 2-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Nine seconds later, 49er safety Ronnie Lott intercepted a Wilson pass intended 
for Darrin Nelson, returning it 5 yards to the Minnesota 30. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-yard reverse run by Rice took it down to the 9, setting up a 4-yard 
touchdown pass play, Montana to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, after the 49ers had driven 59 yards down to the 11, Montana 
faked right and looked left to Rice, who froze Viking corner Reggie Rutland 
with an inside move. Rice went outside. Touchdown and 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings only made a game of it twice. On their first possession of the 
third quarter, they finally discovered Carter hit him twice on pass plays of 21 
and 14 yards to set up a 5-yard scoring pass from Wilson to Hassan Jones. 
Nelson missed the extra point, cutting the lead to 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
The play that turned the game came with 2:26 left in the third quarter. 
Rutland, anticipating a Montana pass to Rice in the left flat, cut in front of 
the receiver at his own 40 and seemed in perfect position to make the 
interception and take it 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We both had the ball in our hands," Rutland said, describing the play. "We 
came down with it." 
</P>
<P>
The ball, in fact, went past Rutland's fingertips into the hands of Rice, who 
turned it into a 28-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's game, Rutland took a similar gamble and returned a Montana 
interception 45 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
As Rutland would say, there were many things different about this game. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have went either way," Rutland said. "In another situation, it might 
have been different. I'd play it the same way each time. I'd just come down 
with it each time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 21-16 game, Rice's catch set up the touchdown that put the 49ers 
up, 28-9. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig removed all comeback doubts when he turned a simple pitch into an 
80-yard touchdown run with 9:04 left. It was the longest run of Craig's career 
and the longest day in recent Viking memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, that run was by design," Walsh said of Craig's run. "It 
broke like we had hoped. But after the first 5 yards, it was all Roger." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who had been mostly frustrated until his big run, finished with 135 
yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Young replaced Montana with 7:46 remaining. Redemption was sweet, Montana would 
say. And complete.

NFL MONDAY REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LEAGUE MAY LUCK OUT IN THE LONG RUN

To put the NFL's Black Sunday in perspective: 
</P>
<P>
* Would it have been a surprise if someone predicted at the start of the season 
that the Giants would lose in Philadelphia, the Bears would lose in Minnesota 
and the Rams would beat the 49ers at Candlestick, where they had won three of 
the last five? 
</P>
<P>
* If the Giants and 49ers had lost in Week 3, next Monday night's meeting 
between two 10-1 teams would have been almost as big as if the teams were both 
11-0. 
</P>
<P>
* How much do those losses really matter to the Bears, Giants and 49ers when 
they all need little more than one more victory in five weeks to clinch their 
divisions? 
</P>
<P>
"They're still chasing us," the Giants' Bill Parcells said after his 10-0 team 
crashed and burned, 31-13, at the hands of the Eagles, who have now won five of 
their last six over New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the truck hit me I just stood there and watched," Mike Ditka said after 
his Bears were crushed 41-13 in Minnesota. "I wasn't worried about getting up. 
That's part of life." 
</P>
<P>
The day gave credence to the theory of that it's not being hot that puts you in 
the playoffs, it's being hot at the right time. The Eagles now have won five 
straight and the Vikings four straight after awful starts. Philadelphia should 
be the first NFC wild-card and Minnesota now has a good shot. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means in the long run is that the NFL may luck out, getting teams 
into its expanded playoffs that deserve to be there. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFC, you can pencil in the 49ers, Bears, Giants and Eagles (No. 1 wild 
card), then select from the Redskins, Packers, Vikings and perhaps the Saints 
for the other spot. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, mark in Buffalo, Miami, Kansas City and the Raiders plus the winner 
of the Central Division where Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are tied at 6-5 with 
Houston half a game behind going into tonight's game with Buffalo. The last 
wild-card team most likely will also come from the Central. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs' victory over the Raiders on Sunday gives them the ultimate 
tie-breaker (two wins in head-to-head meetings) should they tie for the 
division title. The AFC East should come down to the Dec. 23 Miami-Buffalo game 
in Buffalo (the Dolphins won the first meeting).

TELEVISION: MADDEN, WALSH TALK NOW, THEN LATER ON GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a pro football fan, it's pretty hard to beat today's fare. Not one 
but two championship games. 
</P>
<P>
You're going to be hearing analysis before, during and after both games, and 
the main men are Bill Walsh and John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, the NBC newcomer, knows a lot about the San Francisco 49ers, but 
circumstances dictate that he works the AFC game between the Cleveland Browns 
and the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has Madden, a former AFC coach, on the NFC game between the Rams and the 
49ers at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Both commentators were interviewed last week. First, Madden's views. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can the Rams beat the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of 
the year. If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and 
they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that. But 
I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little 
overconfident and maybe a little complacent? 
</P>
<P>
A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the Giants had won, they 
could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much 
respect for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
I've been working on my All-Madden team and have talked with some of the 49ers, 
and when I ask what team, besides the 49ers, is the best, every guy says the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should the Rams try to put a lot of pressure on Joe Montana? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did 
(Philadelphia's Randall) Cunningham. I don't think sacks, either way, are going 
to be a big thing in this game. What the Rams have to do more than anything 
else is tackle the receivers as soon as they catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
What they can't do is let Jerry Rice break away for a 70-yard touchdown after 
he catches a short pass, like he did against the Vikings. They can't let John 
Taylor break away like he did against them in that Monday night game. The Rams 
look like they're tackling better since that game. 
</P>
<P>
You're not going to shut out Rice and Taylor. But when they do catch the ball, 
you've got to tackle them, put the clamps on 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You grew up with John Robinson in Daly City, Calif. He has been your 
lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching 
the Oakland Raiders. Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being 
a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully. It's just that I know John as 
well as anybody. He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running 
backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached 
in this league. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now 
has, passing is the way to go. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, not 
when you have guys like Jim Everett and Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard. 
They've even been working Ron Brown into the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the 
best is going to win this game. The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
What the 49ers have to do is help Montana get into his rhythm. If he does that, 
the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had 
to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, 
the Giants and 49ers. And they've already done half of that. 
</P>
<P>
And now from Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The last two times Denver and Cleveland met for the AFC championship, the 
Broncos won both times, first on a 15-play, 98-yard drive and then when the 
Browns' Earnest Byner fumbled on the three-yard line. Might the Browns be a 
little gun-shy? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about 
making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let 
it fly. It's up to (Coach) Bud Carson to keep the team loose, and it's up to 
(owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in 
this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active. 
Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the receivers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup. 
Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out 
of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group. 
</P>
<P>
We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game. He knows his 
people so well. He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also 
quick, and more dependable. Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best 
routes. He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, 
Young is the guy Elway likes to go to. They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, 
but he's good going downfield. And Steve Sewell, like Metcalf for the Browns, 
is good coming out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the 
NFC. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, Cincinnati came close to the 49ers last year (the Bengals lost, 
20-16), so that shows anything can happen. But there is no question the NFC is 
the stronger, more physical conference.

<LEADPARA>  History will be made Sunday in Tampa, Fla., but it won't be by the 49ers.;   
Their dream of winning an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title
died Sunday at a breezy, sun-dappled Candlestick Park with an achingly close
15-13 loss to the New York Giants in the NFC championship game.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A GIANT LETDOWN
GIANTS' KICKING AND DEFENSE KNOCK NINERS
OFF THRONE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NFC Championship: Giants 15, 49ers 13  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The 49ers and Giants provided a distraction from the Persian Gulf War for
several hours, but the result probably left the 49ers fans feeling more
downtrodden than before they arrived. Add the sight of Joe Montana being
helped off the field with a broken right hand and a bruised sternum after a
fourth-quarter sack by Leonard Marshall, and it was anything but a nice day at
the park.;    Dreams of a pseudo Bay Area Super Bowl already had ended earlier
in the day with the Buffalo Bills' 51-3 thrashing of the Los Angeles (nee
Oakland) Raiders for the AFC title.;    Instead, history will be made with the
Giants and Bills meeting in the first all-New York State Super Bowl. The Bills
will be seeking their first Super Bowl title, the Giants their second.;   
Those marks, however, are considerably lower on NFL history's wall than the
49ers' target. Four teams -- the 49ers, Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins and
Pittsburgh Steelers -- have won two Super Bowls in a row. No team has won
three in a row. Still.;    "It's one that hurts now, but is obviously going to
hurt more in the next few days," said 49ers Coach George Seifert.;    The
dream died in weather too pleasant for a funeral, but the crowd of 65,750
reacted as if that were the occasion. The second-largest crowd to see a 49ers
game stood grim-faced and silent while watching the Giants cavort on the
field. Long after Matt Bahr's fifth field goal sailed through the uprights as
the final second ticked off the scoreboard clock, the crowd stayed put.;   
There was silence inside the 49ers' locker room, too. No tears, no anguished
cries, no shouts of anger. Several 49ers refused to be interviewed. Those who
did spoke softly or in whispers.;    "I've never heard this locker room so
quiet," said linebacker Mike Walter, an eight-year veteran who had
participated in three of the 49ers' four Super Bowl victories. "You could hear
the CBS people whispering, getting their shots ready. That was the only noise
in here, period.";    At first, anyway. Seifert tried to rouse his players,
reminding them that only a great team could have finished the regular season
14-2 and advanced to the NFC championship game.;    Running back Roger Craig
also spoke, apologizing for his fumble at the Giants' 41 with 2 minutes, 36
seconds left and the 49ers clinging to a 13-12 lead.;    "I had two hands on
it," Craig said. "It's hard to say what happened. All I know is I hit the
hole, and the next thing the ball was out.";    There actually was no hole.
Craig ran into the back of right guard Harris Barton before the ball fell from
Craig's grasp and linebacker Lawrence Taylor recovered it at the 43.;   
Quarterback Jeff Hostetler, playing on a hyperextended left knee, eluded a
heavy rush by scrambling right for the dozenth time and hit tight end Mark
Bavaro for a 19-yard gain, putting the Giants close to field-goal range at the
49ers' 38. Defensive end Kevin Fagan dropped running back Ottis Anderson for a
4-yard loss on the next play, but Hostetler struck again on second down,
rolling right and hitting wide receiver Stephen Baker.;    The 13-yard
completion put the Giants at the 49ers' 29, which would translate into a
46-yard field-goal attempt. Bahr had already converted field goals from 28,
42, 46 and 38 yards and missed from 37.;    The Giants gained 4 more yards
before Bahr's winning field goal, from 42 yards, put the Giants into their
first Super Bowl since 1987.;    Not that Bahr did it alone. The Giants' pass
rushers, notably Taylor, Gary Reasons and Leonard Marshall, were in Montana's
face from the first play of the game. Their offensive line punched holes in
the 49ers' No. 1-ranked rushing defense for 152 yards in 36 carries. Their
receivers, led by Mark Ingram and Bavaro with five catches apiece, broke free
to make 15 receptions for 176 yards.;    The 49ers, meanwhile, were living by
the talent of a handful of superstars, much as they have all season. The
game's only touchdown was produced by what will be remembered as the John
Taylor Drive.;    It was the 49ers' first drive of the third quarter, which
Taylor opened by catching 55-yard punt by Sean Landeta at the 49ers' 8,
veering to the left sideline and racing 31 yards before stepping out of
bounds. On first down at the New York 39, Taylor leaped at the Giants' 40 to
catch a pass from Montana, slipped away from cornerback Everson Walls and
pranced down the left sideline into the end zone. With 10:28 left in the third
quarter, the 49ers had broken a 6-6 halftime deadlock and led 13-6.;    For a
moment, it looked as if Walls, who was a Dallas Cowboy covering Dwight Clark
when Clark made the end-zone catch that sent the 49ers to their first Super
Bowl, had again been fitted with goat's horns.;    "That's history," Walls
said. "That's always going to be there, but now I have something to negate it
with.";    The end, perhaps, was appropriate. The 49ers' weak points have been
apparent all season -- no running game, a weak secondary, a suspect offensive
line -- and they clearly had a game plan intended to hide them. But it was
Giants Coach Bill Parcells who had the biggest impact, calling for a fake punt
that Reasons turned into a 30-yard run, setting up Bahr's fourth field goal.; 
  The 49ers' tricks produced, aside from Taylor's individual brilliance, two
first-half field goals by Mike Cofer.;    "George did say there will be some
shots taken at us, some second-guessing, some arm-chair quarterbacks," Walter
said. "A lot was expected of us. A lot was expected from ourselves. It's fine
line from being there and not. This time we didn't do it."  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  The NFL/Final Weekend  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  TV/RADIO: ch. 7, 11/KGO (810).; 49ERS UPDATE: The 49ers were eliminated from
the playoffs last Monday, when New Orleans clinched the final NFC playoff
spot. . . . This is the first season since 1982 that the 49ers have not been
in the playoffs. . . . With a win tonight, the 49ers would have nine
consecutive seasons with at least 10 victories. . . . Steve Young will make
his first start since Nov. 3, the day he injured ligaments in his left knee.
He will wear a brace on his knee and claims he will try not to run as much.
Young is 4-5 as a starter this season. Steve Bono will be back on the
sideline, calling signals and wearing a cast on his left leg. . . . Though
Charles Haley is still bothered by a hamstring injury, he should start. . . .
Running back Keith Henderson, who missed last week, will probably miss this
final game of the season, too. . . . Receiver John Taylor needs 56 receiving
yards to achieve a 1,000-yard season for the second time in his career. Jerry
Rice is over 1,000 yards for the sixth straight season. . . . The 49ers are
ranked fourth in overall offense in the league (11th rushing and fourth
passing) and fifth in defense (sixth against the run and eighth against the
pass).; BEARS UPDATE: The Bears must win in order to clinch the NFC Central
title, because of Detroit's win Sunday over Buffalo. A Chicago victory will
mean a bye next weekend in the playoffs. A defeat means that Chicago will be a
wild card and must host the Dallas Cowboys next week. . . . The Bears haven't
won at Candlestick since 1985. The last time they visited the Bay Area, on
Christmas Eve 1989, the 49ers shut them out 26-0. . . . Running backs Neal
Anderson and Brad Muster have been injured, but both are expected to start. .
. . Quarterback Jim Harbaugh has broken team records for pass attempts and
completions this season. If he has a big night and throws for 264 yards, he
will break the Bears' season record for yardage. . . . Richard Dent has 10 1/2
sacks. . . . The Bears are ranked 14th in offense (ninth rushing and 17th
passing) but third in defense (seventh against the run and third against the
pass).; KEY INJURIES: 49ers -- QB Bono (left knee) is out; RB Henderson (right
ankle) is questionable; LB Haley (left hamstring), G Guy McIntyre (left ribs),
RB Tom Rathman (left ribs, left ankle), LB Bill Romanowski (flu) are all
probable. Bears -- G Mark Bortz (leg) is doubtful; S Markus Paul (ankle) and
TE Jim Thornton (ankle) are questionable; RB Anderson (hamstring) and FB
Muster (hip, hamstring) are probable.  </TEXT>

AS SEASON SORTS OUT WINNERS AND LOSERS, 49ERS STILL NFL'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 games, the 28-team NFL field has sorted itself out so neatly that all 
six division races have a clear leader; strengths and weaknesses are 
well-defined; and the teams with enough youth and depth to withstand key 
injuries have come to the fore. The playoff contenders are leaving the 
backstretch, and as New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells said, "Now is when 
you've got to start thinking about the stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for NFL writers, too. Here is one man's analysis of each division and 
the wild-card situation: 
</P>
<P>
* NFC East -- The Giants should win it. Think of their 31-10 loss to the Los 
Angeles Rams as something comparable to a necessary correction in the stock 
market. It's a 16-game season, and the Giants were due for an off game after 
several weeks of peak performance. Parcells is pushing the right buttons, and 
the Philadelphia Eagles are two games back and playing poorly on offense. The 
true measure of the Giants will come in Weeks 12-14 when they play at San 
Francisco, home against the Eagles and at Denver. The Rams? They will have a 
tough time winning a divisional playoff game in January at Giants Stadium -- if 
they get that far. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC Central -- The Minnesota Vikings' pass rush is on a record-setting pace 
with 50 sacks, just 22 short of the NFL record set in 1984 by the Chicago 
Bears. But they still are muddling around on offense, trying to figure out how 
to use Herschel Walker, and their lone divisional loss was to the Bears. Only 
one of the Vikings' six remaining opponents has a losing record, so the Bears 
still have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC West -- The 49ers easily are the class of the league and have the best 
chance of any team to repeat as Super Bowl champs since the 1978-79 Pittsburgh 
Steelers. They're determined to prove they can win without former Coach Bill 
Walsh. His successor, George Seifert, has filled those big shoes, if not the 
big ego, admirably. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC wild-card situation -- The Bears-Vikings loser in the NFC Central should 
gain one wild-card berth. The Eagles, Rams and New Orlans Saints will battle 
for the other spot. The Rams have the most talent, but if the Saints complete a 
sweep of the season series with the Rams at home in Week 12, they will be in a 
strong position. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC East -- Buffalo has a rugged schedule, but the Bills' defense and 
quarterback Jim Kelly are up to it. Week 15 may provide a Super Bowl preview 
when the Bills visit the 49ers. The Dolphins have a soft schedule, but Miami is 
the only team with a winning record that has given up more points than it has 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC Central -- Bud Carson's Cleveland Browns have the No. 1 defense against 
scoring in the NFL, and they have fashioned an adequate running game with the 
emergence of rookie running back Eric Metcalf. They are capable of winning the 
division, but it might go down to the final game of the season at Houston. The 
Cincinnati Bengals will struggle to finish above .500. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC West -- The Broncos all but clinched it with a win over the Kansas City 
Chiefs for a three-game lead. They will be tough if they earn the home field 
advantage throughout the playoffs, especially since former Los Angeles Raiders 
Coach Mike Shanahan is working with quarterback John Elway again. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC wild-card situation -- The second-place finisher between the Browns and 
Oilers in the AFC Central will get one spot. The Dolphins have the inside track 
for the other but may stumble in two games with the Chiefs. If that happens, 
the Bengals or Raiders could sneak in. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC playoffs -- No one will stop the 49ers, but the Giants have the best 
chance if they can keep Ottis Anderson and the running game going strong enough 
to set up Phil Simms' passing in the playoffs. The Vikings have the talent but 
seem to lack the chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC playoffs -- The Bills are the best all-round AFC team, but the 
sentimental choice, the Browns, will pull off a couple of playoff upsets to 
reach New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
* Super Bowl -- The preseason choice here hasn't changed: 49ers. 
</P>

Reports from newspapers in Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta that the New York Jets 
have contacted Duke Coach Steve Spurrier as a potential replacement for Coach 
Joe Walton don't necessarily mean the Jets are ready to make a move. After the 
1987 season, they explored the idea of hiring Carl Peterson, who since has 
become the Chiefs' president and general manager, but decided against making a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it will be surprising if the Jets don't recognize the 
need for change this time around and if they don't also research the top NFL 
assistants, as well as college coaches. Of course, it would help if they had a 
football man in charge of the search. 
</P>
<P>
No one should question the courage of Jets QB Ken O'Brien because he failed to 
go headfirst into Dolphins safety Louis Oliver at the goal line in one of the 
key plays of a 31-23 loss. If things were going well for the Jets and O'Brien, 
he certainly would have reacted differently. His instinct to avoid the hit 
showed not a lack of toughness, but rather that O'Brien has taken such a 
pounding in a 2-8 season that he is like a fighter bobbing and weaving and 
trying to survive with his back against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the "next Lawrence Taylor" is over now that rookie outside 
linebacker Derrick Thomas has arrived with the Chiefs. He's stronger against 
the run than the Bills' Cornelius Bennett and a more consistent pass rusher. 
"He's in that class of player," Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry said of Thomas. 
"They threw him in the fire from the first day. He had to learn or look bad, 
and he doesn't like to look bad." 
</P>
<P>
Eagles QB Randall Cunningham, whose receivers dropped 11 passes in a 10-3 loss 
to the Washington Redskins, heard boos from the Philadelphia crowd, which is no 
surprise. "The fans are used to seeing a high-powered offense," Cunningham 
said. Hinting he would like to be turned loose to throw more, he added, "I 
can't boo." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys cornerback Everson Walls, a former Pro Bowl player, said Coach Jimmy 
Johnson's plan to give more playing time to Issiac Holt is the first step 
toward getting rid of Walls. Walls was responsible for giving up a 
fourth-quarter TD pass in a 24-20 loss to Phoenix, and Johnson shouted at him 
for talking to his friends on the Cardinals after the game. Said Walls: "He 
embarrassed me. Only college coaches and Mike Ditka do that ... I guess they'll 
Plan B me." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Lions Coach Wayne Fontes on his 2-8 team's 31-22 upset of the Green Bay 
Packers, who held a 31-8 advantage in first downs and out-gained the Lions 432 
yards to 128: "We lost to ... uh ... won against a good football team. I almost 
slipped there. I've gotten used to that word."

<LEADPARA>  THE 49ers are looking for help. Today. Tomorrow. Soon. This is what team
President Carmen Policy admitted in so many words after Sunday's miserably
sloppy 17-14 defeat. Yes, Policy said, the 49ers have an open mind about
making a trade or two.;   Good executive decision.  </LEADPARA>

section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "We've had people on the phones all week," said Policy, the highest-ranking
49ers official on the premises Sunday. Team owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who was
busy elsewhere, did not attend.;   Therefore, when the last 49ers tackle had
missed and the last 49ers mental error had sent the last foul odor wafting
toward the canvas Metrodome roof, Policy had the duty of leading the team's
front-office delegation from the upstairs press box to the visitors' locker
room.;   The parade was a silent one, down a sterile gray concrete stairwell.;
  "It's no fun when the season starts this way," Policy said softly.;   No
fun, and no good, and no way to make people stop wondering if the 49ers are in
trouble.;   They are out of the blocks 1-2 for the first time since 1982 --
which also was the last time they missed the playoffs. In fairness, we must
note that in 1981 the 49ers also began the season with a 1-2 record, then went
on to win their first Super Bowl.;   But which way will this season go? That
depends on what the 49ers do in the next few weeks -- not just on the field,
but off the field. If you will recall, the 1981 team received a huge boost
when a trade for sack specialist Fred Dean was made in midseason. The same
thing needs to happen again, 10 years later.;   It is time to make a trade.
Not a panicky trade, but a smart one, and a significant one. For a quality
defensive back, or a superior offensive back. Otherwise, you can forget about
another Super Bowl. The 49ers, as they stand right now, are good enough to
reach the playoffs. But not good enough to reach the Super Bowl, as Sunday's
game exposed to the entire league.;   There have been games in the past when
49ers losses seemed like flukes. This one seemed like the real deal, with the
Vikings driving 98 yards down the field at one point and 78 yards another
time. That's not a fluke. The 49ers must make a deal.;   The most obvious
position to begin with is defensive back. Injuries have left the 49ers with a
starter like Kevin Lewis, who has been cut from NFL rosters three times, twice
by the 49ers themselves. Lewis may be a fine human being and a diligent
worker. But how can you expect someone like him to shut down an All-Pro
receiver like the Vikings' Anthony Carter?;   The answer: You can't. Carter
roamed the Metrodome like an Amway salesman on a detergent high, going door to
door and making big scores along the way. The 49ers' strong pass rush usually
hurries the opposing quarterback and gives the defensive backs some room for
error. That didn't happen Sunday.;   "There were some blown coverages and
problems tackling downfield," said Coach George Seifert, without specifically
pointing the finger at Lewis but speaking pointedly. "Maybe we were zigging
when we should have been zagging.";   So what's the answer? Veteran free agent
Mark Lee -- acquired a week ago after he was cut by Green Bay -- sure doesn't
seem to be the definitive answer. That leaves a trade. And when asked, Policy
did not deny that defensive backs are on the team's wish list.;   "There just
isn't much out there," he said. "And the teams want too much for the people
who are available.";   Something else to keep in mind: Even with the
defensive-back situation, the 49ers still allowed just 17 points Sunday. So
the offense may need help, too. The most frequently mentioned name is Denver
halfback Bobby Humphrey. With the 49ers' running corps not exactly ripping
apart the opposition (quarterback Steve Young had the longest run from
scrimmage again Sunday: 11 yards), a guy like Humphrey sounds like a pretty
good acquisition.;   But again, the word is that the Broncos want too much in
return: a defensive end like Kevin Fagan or Pierce Holt, plus a high draft
choice.;   Too much? Today, it's easy to believe that. But if the 49ers don't
win their next two games, against the Rams and Raiders, you can bet it will be
much harder to believe.;   A fact: Both 49ers touchdowns Sunday were scored by
Jerry Rice, and both were classic all-pro receptions -- one with a man hanging
all over him, the other on a cutback sprint to the end zone that took your
breath away.;   Only certain players can do those sorts of things, and right
now the 49ers need one of those certain players at running back, too. It is
fruitless to argue about whether Roger Craig should still be on the team,
whether the 49ers were banana brains for allowing him to escape on the Plan B
airlift. It is fruitless, because Craig is gone, and he isn't coming back.;  
It is not fruitless, though, to wonder whether Humphrey could be Craig's best
replacement. He could. In the interest of equal time, though, you should know
that there are plenty of voices in the 49ers' locker room who believe no trade
is necessary, either offensively or defensively.;   Dave Waymer, the
experienced safety, noted: "This team was 6-5 once and won the Super Bowl. I
don't think people should push the panic button . . . We've got to go to the
party with the girl we brought to the dance, so we've got to dance with these
girls.";   Maybe.;   Guy McIntyre, the savvy guard, said, "I think we have
adequate talent on this team; it's a matter of finding a groove and finding a
way not to make mistakes. You can bring in all the new people you want, but if
they make mistakes, too, what difference is there? Besides, I don't know if we
can bring anyone in here that's going to make a difference.";   Maybe. But do
the 49ers really want to spend the rest of the season wondering if he's right?  </TEXT>
