   Director Ingmar Bergman is turning 70,
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking
in a run of theater successes.
   Recuperating from a hip operation, Bergman is quietly
celebrating his July 14 birthday at his retreat at Faro, a rugged
island of beaches and pine trees in the Baltic Sea, with some of
his eight children and his fifth wife, Ingrid.
   Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely
touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his
1982 triumph ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards.
   But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions
scheduled in Sweden until 1991.
   In April he scored a critical and box office sensation with his
stage production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night.'' His autobiography, ``Lanterna Magica,'' was a Swedish
bestseller when it was published last year.
   His Swedish-language production of ``Hamlet,'' put in a modern
setting, was panned by some critics here, but was a sensation in
Florence, Italy, and won a critics prize last year in London. It
played in New York in May.
   ``Hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances,''
Bergman said in a radio interview. ``It is the best I can do, which
means that I have reached quite far with it,''
   His next directing project will be Shakespeare's ``A Winter's
Tale,'' at Stockholm's 200-year-old Royal Dramatic Theater.
   Bergman was not always the cultural hero in Sweden that he is
today. His volcanic temper didn't help.
   ``He used to refer to anyone who didn't throw furniture around
as `inhibited,'' says Gunnel Lindblom, one of his leading ladies.
   In 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known
for his sharp reviews.
   ``And it was worth it,'' Bergman said.
   Today he says the critics don't bother him as much.
   ``I don't even get angry,'' he said in the radio interview. ``Of
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very
hurt. But not after 45 years.''
   Now, he says, ``everybody is very kind to me. ... I suppose it
is because I have become old and harmless.''
   His many love affairs, often with women starring in his films,
drew more attention in Sweden than his art. But his latest marriage
_ his fifth _ has lasted since the early 1970's.
   In his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession.
   ``There were very many years of my life when I was so occupied
with what I was doing that I forgot wives and children. Now since I
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my
children,'' he said.
   Bergman was Sweden's youngest theater director at 26 when he was
put in charge of the provincial Helsingborg City Theater in
southern Sweden. The theatrical tradition, he says, has always been
the real influence on his art.
   He is best known for directing more than 50 films, most of which
he wrote himself. He won three Oscars for best foreign films: ``The
Virgin Spring'' in 1960, ``Through a Glass Darkly'' in 1962 and
``Fanny and Alexander.''
   To mark the birthday, the Swedish Film Institute published a
special English-language edition of its magazine, Chaplin, paying
homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who
launched the careers of such international stars as Liv Ulmann,
Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow.
   ``Bergman is probably the greatest film artist, all things
considered, since the invention of the motion-picture camera,''
wrote Woody Allen, one of a dozen international directors
contributing to the 90-page tribute.
   Sir Richard Attenborough, the British director, said Bergman
``extended the medium (of film) in a manner unequalled by any of
his contemporaries.''
   For some four decades Bergman divided his time between theater
and film, likening the two forums to ``my wife and my mistress.''
After ``Fanny and Alexander'' he said he was giving up his
``mistress'' and devoting himself to the stage. Since then he
produced only one Swedish television film in 1984, ``After the
Repetition.''
   ``Fanny and Alexander'' was a multi-levelled story of a
well-to-do family at the turn of the century, which appeared to
have traces of Bergman's own childhood with his clergyman father.
   The film marked Bergman's return to Sweden after six years in
self-imposed exile in West Germany. In 1976 he was hauled away by
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations. He was
cleared, but left the country in disgust.
   He is now back at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he saw his
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963
to 1966.

   Director Ingmar Bergman is turning 70,
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking
in a run of theater successes.
   Bergman is quietly celebrating his July 14 birthday at his
retreat at Faro, a rugged island of beaches and pine trees in the
Baltic Sea, with some of his eight children and his fifth wife,
Ingrid.
   Associates describe his health as good, although he suffers from
a painful hip. But Gote Eriksson, planning director of the Royal
Dramatic Theater, said Bergman was ``in good form'' at the premier
of his latest play in April, and postponed a hip operation which
had been scheuled for May.
   Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely
touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his
1982 triumph ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards.
   But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions

   After quarrels with the tax collector,
Sweden's favorite theatrical sons have come home.
   Max von Sydow is back on the Swedish stage after a 14-year
absence. Director Ingmar Bergman, who lived in self-imposed exile
for several years, also is rehearsing a new play.
   Both Bergman, whose brooding, introspective films in the 1950s
and '60s gave Swedish film an international reputation, and von
Sydow, Sweden's most durable actor, left the country because of tax
problems.
   Von Sydow, who lives in Paris but comes back every year for
summer vacation, never thought of himself as an expatriate and has
returned twice to make films.
   ``I'm still totally Swedish,'' he said. ``I still have my roots
here.''
   Swedish taxes, among the highest in the world, are driving young
artists away, he said in an interview. The average Swede pays half
his salary in taxes, and marginal tax on top incomes can run as
high as 78 percent.
   ``A lot of talent is not used in this country because of this.
If you don't get anything financially out of it, why work here?''
said von Sydow, 58.
   Among his 40 foreign film roles are the Jesuit priest in ``The
Exorcist,'' the assassin in ``Three Days of the Condor,'' and the
artist@husband in Woody Allen's ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' He
launched his career abroad in 1965 as Jesus in ``The Greatest Story
Ever Told.''
   Von Sydow left Sweden in a huff in 1973 after paying what he
said was an unfairly large tax bill. He was assessed $20,050 for
allegedly underpaying his taxes. His lawyers took the case to the
European Human Rights Commission in 1985, claiming that the lack of
an appeal mechanism against the tax authorities was an infringement
of his rights. Last year, the Swedish government settled out of
court, repaying him $33,333 compensation and $20,000 for costs.
   Von Sydow said he is trying to put the tax affair behind him
without bitterness.
   ``I'm trying not to be poisoned by paranoia,'' he said. ``Today
I feel freer than when I left, because this problem is solved and
because I know that if I want to I could work abroad all the time.''
   His ties to his country are stronger than others have shown.
Once Hollywood made stars of Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, they
were gone from Sweden for good.
   Von Sydow is playing at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he
began his acting career 40 years ago and where he met Bergman, with
whom he did 11 films.
   He said one reason for returning to the stage was fascination
with the character he was offered in ``Master Olof,'' an 1871 drama
by August Strindberg, Sweden's greatest literary figure.
   He plays a roguish revolutionary during the 16th-century Swedish
Reformation. It's a supporting role, but von Sydow said he doesn't
care. ``It's the best part in the play,'' he said.
   He said he also was drawn by the double anniversary of the royal
theater's 200th year and the 80th year since it moved to its gilded
waterfront building, now a city landmark.
   Working in the Swedish language again ``is wonderful, it's
exciting,'' he said. ``It's still very difficult for me to act in
English, and it always will be. ... It takes a longer time to
really make the lines your own.''
   Last year von Sydow, who does three projects a year, finished
``Pelle the Conqueror,'' his first Swedish-language film in five
years.
   The title role of Pelle, a peasant farmhand, could have been
tailored for the tall, blond Swede with a farmer's weatherbeaten
look and huge hands. The role won him the prestigious Swedish
Golden Bug Award as best actor in 1987 and two Danish acting
prizes, one by critics and one by the film academy. The film will
be entered in the Cannes Film Festival.
   ``It's such a rich character,'' he said. ``He is so vulnerable
and so miserable; he is full of expectations, he is terribly
disappointed, he is very happy, he is furious. ... It's probably
the best part I've ever had.''
   Von Sydow also is directing his first movie, a Danish-language
film called ``Along the Roadside.''
   Bergman, 69, is directing his fifth play since returning from
West Germany, where he lived for about five years until he came
back in 1982 to film the acclaimed ``Fanny and Alexander.''
   In 1976, tax inspectors barged into a rehearsal and took the
famed director away for questioning on suspicion of tax evasion. He
was cleared of all charges, but he wrote in his 1987 autobiography
that the incident drove him into a depression that turned to rage
against his country.
   At the same time, he was uncomfortable away from Sweden.
   ``I felt like an invalid who had lost an arm and a leg,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   ``I longed for the old language, the friends and the
companionship.''
   Bergman's staging of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' reunites him with Bibi Andersson whom he discovered in a
soap advertisement in 1952 and launched as an international actress.
   Andersson, 53, left acting for several years to work in peace
causes, but came back to the stage in 1986.

   Ingmar Bergman's staging of ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' is a smash with audiences and critics
more than three decades after the play premiered on the same
Stockholm stage.
   The revival of Eugene O'Neill's classic at the National Dramatic
Theater earned what one critic called the best review he ever
wrote. The play opened April 17 and is sold out through August.
   This triumph for Bergman, who turns 70 on July 14, comes at a
time the director describes as the twilight of his career. He has
said he has made his last film.
   But his schedule is unusual for a man claiming to approach
retirement. His modernized Swedish-language version of Hamlet won
plaudits in London. The play goes to New York in June.
   He also is preparing Shakespeare's ``A Winter's Tale,'' and an
opera to open here in 1991. In November, he published a
best-selling autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   But seldom in his 50-year career has the applause of his home
critics been louder than for the O'Neill play.
   ``This is sensational. World theater, if anything,'' wrote
Ingmar Bjorksten, drama critic of the Svenska Dagbladet, in what he
called his most enthusiastic review ever.
   Bergman's handling of the play was ``full of human knowledge''
and marked by a ``sympathy and warmth unusual for him.''
   ``Brilliant,'' headlined Aftonbladet, which published three
glowing reviews. It called Bergman ``a brilliant editor'' for
cutting an hour from the original script ``with nothing of
O'Neill's essentials removed.''
   The play stars Bibi Andersson, whom Bergman launched on an
international career in the 1950s and with whom he had a two-year
affair 30 years ago.
   ``I have never experienced such box office pressure for a play
like this. People are writing and calling from all over the
country, even Denmark and Norway,'' theater director Lars Lofgren
told The Associated Press.
   The Dramatic Theater, which celebrates its centennial this year,
was given the rights to stage the world premiere of O'Neill's
unpublished plays after his death in 1953.
   Tom Olsson, the theater's librarian and an O'Neill scholar, said
that according to the playwright's widow Carlotta, O'Neill was
pleased with the theater's handling of his early plays and their
success on the Swedish stage.
   ``Long Day's Journey'' premiered on Feb. 10, 1956, and the play
was such a hit that it entered theatrical legend here. It won the
1957 Pulitzer Prize for drama.
   Bergman was absent from the revival's opening night 32 years
later. He said later he was looking after his flu-stricken wife,
Ingrid, and did not want to draw attention from the actors.
   His associates said Bergman also was suffering from a painful
hip which plagued him through the rehearsals and was scheduled for
an operation shortly after the premiere.
   But he received a special ovation when the ensemble bowed to an
empty seat in the first row after their ninth curtain call.
   Bergman's movies, which he began making in the 1950s, won world
acclaim for their brooding explorations of troubled relationships.
   Outraged by an charge of tax evasion which was later dropped,
Bergman lived in self-imposed exile in West Germany for seven
years, before returning home in 1982 to direct the film ``Fanny and
Alexander.''
   Bergman's 70th birthday is likely to be the subject of national
celebrations. Chaplin magazine, published by the Swedish Film
Institute, published a 90-page English-language special edition in
April with tributes from leading movie directors.
   ``Probably the greatest film artist, all things considered,
since the invention of the motion picture camera,'' said Woody
Allen.

   As a child, Ingmar Bergman's parents
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed. To amuse himself, he
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and
pretended he was at the movies.
   Now 71, the famed director has written a screenplay about his
father, Erik Bergman, an insecure and depression-prone pastor, and
his mother, Karin, a woman of iron self-discipline who cringed at
any show of love.
   In ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman casts back his memory and his
imagination to the first 10 years of his parent's turbulent
relationship and marriage.
   The play is a six-hour chronicle in four acts, to be shown as a
four-part television series and a two-part movie. Production begins
late next year, and the scheduled premiere will be on Swedish
television Channel One in 1992.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood, my nerves and my genes,'' Bergman said.
   Bergman gave up film direction after his 1982 ``Fanny and
Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards. Since then, he has been
busy producing stage plays at the Royal Dramatic Theater in
Stockholm, which once rejected him for a job when he was an
aspiring 21-year-old production assistant.
   For ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman vacated the director's chair to
Danish filmmaker Bille August, whose ``Pelle the Conqueror'' won
the 1989 Academy Award for best foreign film. Bergman said that
after he saw ``Pelle'' six times, the choice of the 40-year-old
Dane was obvious.
   August called the screenplay ``one of the best love stories I
have ever read. It is a great drama and an honor to take part in
delivering.''
   As evidenced in his confession-like autobiography, ``The Magic
Lantern,'' Bergman has been grappling with confusion for many years
over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
Bergman's 50 films. In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The 1973 film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and
a servant girl. Bergman has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the
dreams and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he
said. It took him five months last year to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an
affluent home. The characters have fictional names, which allows
Bergman to play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in 1909 to the
year of Bergman's birth in 1918.
   In his memoirs, Bergman wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and
were produced on command, but never rashly.''
   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,
punishment, forgiveness and grace _ concrete factors in
relationships between children, parents and God.''
   He described his father, a Lutheran minister, as ``nervous,
irritable and depressive. ... He was always fretting and given to
violent outbursts of temper.''
   His mother ``was always tense, slept badly and used strong
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety.
Like Father, she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy.''
   The book barely touches on his parent's feelings for each other,
but a stormy picture emerges when it does.
   As a child, he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and
scuffle. ``We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate
love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother
was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to
take his own life.''
   Divorce in those days was almost unthinkable, especially for a
respected pastor, and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple.
   Yet the reconciliation was mostly for show. ``What was outwardly
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery
and exhausting conflicts,'' he wrote.

over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
Bergman's 50 films. In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The 1973 film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and a
servant girl. Bergman has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the dreams
and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he said. It
took him five months last year to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an affluent
home. The characters have fictional names, which allows Bergman to
play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in 1909 to the
year of Bergman's birth in 1918.
   In his memoirs, Bergman wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and
were produced on command, but never rashly.''
   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,
punishment, forgiveness and grace _ concrete factors in
relationships between children, parents and God.''
   He described his father, a Lutheran minister, as ``nervous,
irritable and depressive. ... He was always fretting and given to
violent outbursts of temper.''
   His mother ``was always tense, slept badly and used strong
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety.
Like Father, she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy.''
   The book barely touches on his parent's feelings for each other,
but a stormy picture emerges when it does.
   As a child, he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and
scuffle. ``We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate
love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother
was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to
take his own life.''
   Divorce in those days was almost unthinkable, especially for a
respected pastor, and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple.
   Yet the reconciliation was mostly for show. ``What was outwardly
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery
and exhausting conflicts,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Sounds of Silince: Sweden Goes Three Minutes Without Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pavarotti stayed off the stage, movies
stopped in midreel, concert halls were hushed and radio programs
fell silent.
   Cultural life in Sweden came to a halt for three minutes at 8:15
p.m. Thursday when actors, musicians, dancers, and even librarians
protested what they called the low level of government support.
   Artists in most countries might be envious of the Swedes.
Stockholm, capital of a country of 8.4 million people, has as many
theaters as London. Artists can get state grants, but they say it
isn't enough to live on.
   State-supported theaters have launched the careers of director
Ingmar Bergman and actors such as Ingrid Bergman, Max von Sydow and
Ingrid Tulin.
   The nation which awards the Nobel prize for literature sells 2.5
million theater tickets a year, nearly one for every third person.
   In an article published Friday, actress Bibi Andersson protested
that the cultural assistance were too low, projects were too
vulnerable to cuts, and grants were too snagged in bureaucratic
tangles.
   ``Why do actors have to get swallowed up in bureaucracy? Why do
fiery spirits grow tired?'' she wrote in the Aftonbladet daily.
   ``What we wanted was to make culture an election issue,'' she
said, referring to the Sept. 18 national elections. ``It's a
question of priorities.''
   ``The strike was a success for the artists. They got a lot of
attention and managed to get their message across,'' said Martin
Lindbloom, spokesman of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
   In the west coast city of Goteborg, touring opera tenor Luciano
Pavarotti delayed the start of his performance by three minutes in
support of the strike. His audience stood in silence during that
time.
   One channel of the state-run television broke into its regular
program for live reports showing movie theaters with darkened
screens, silent stages and a candlelight vigil in Goteborg by 400
people. Two radio channels were quiet, while the third played Simon
and Garfunkel's ``Sounds of Silence.''
   At Stockholm's National Dramatic Theater, the staging of Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' gave the protest a
unique twist.
   At precisely 8:15 p.m., the young artist Edmund delivered his
line, ``I'm broke.'' Action froze on stage for three minutes, then
Edmund's father resumed the play with the reply: ``You're always
broke, and you always will be.''
   Official figures cited by Lindbloom say national support for the
arts is nearly as high in Sweden as in France, and more than
anywhere else in Europe.
   Direct yearly support amounts to $400 million, and municipal
subsidies to local cutural establishment is about $937 million,
Lindbloom said.
   Together with indirect help, such as building new museums or
libraries, Sweden spends about 1.5 percent of its gross national
product on the arts, he told the Associated Press.
   Although nothing has been trimmed from the national budget,
local authorities slash cultural projects first whenever they run
into trouble, complained Ingmar Bjorksten, the cultural affairs
correspondent for Svenska Dagbladet.
   Unemployment among artists is five times the national average of
just under 2 percent, Bjorksten wrote.
   ``The only way for culture to get more money is to make a
fuss,'' said Svante Weyner, head of Radio Sweden's cultural
division. Last year the radio cut the budget for a popular program
of radio plays. The budget was restored only after Ingmar Bergman
intervened.

<AUTHOR> Cynthia Grenier </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   Seventy seems to be the age these days when famous directors at last feel free enough in spirit to present themselves naked to the world, showing all their warts in tight close-up. 

   Earlier this summer we had Elia Kazan baring his soul in some 700 pages; now it is the turn of Sweden's Ingmar Bergman, who in "The Magic Lantern" (Viking, $19.95) manages in a scant 308 pages to document abundantly just how monstrous a monstre sacre he is. 
Like Mr. Kazan, the little Ingmar was an unhappy child who grew into a veritable adolescent nerd. 
He adored his mother, but she often sent him away with "cool ironic words," leaving him weeping with rage and disappointment. 
He discovered that illness immediately attracted her attention, and embarked on a lifetime of stomach disorders and nearly unremitting nervous maladies. 
The onset of the production of every new film or play always sent him off to a clinic for a few weeks. 

   Life with mother proved singularly trying for Ingmar. 
When he was 55, his mother phoned him at his theater to tell him that his father was in the hospital, about to be operated on for a malignant tumor. 
"She wanted me to go see him." 
Ingmar explained that he had neither the time nor the desire to do so, that his father was a person to whom he was indifferent, and that his presence could only frighten and embarrass his father on what was sure to be his deathbed. 
"Mother was angry." 
She persisted. 
"I was upset and refused to be emotionally blackmailed. 
This eternal blackmail." 
His mother began crying; Ingmar hung up on her. 

   Mr. Bergman's relations with his many wives, many more children, siblings and women friends are described briefly and chillingly. 
He does record that his then-19-year-old son, Ingmar Jr., after the death of his mother in an automobile accident, looked at him "with a cold contempt that silenced me." 
Harriet Anderson, star of so many Bergman films, (and the cause of the breakup with Ingmar Jr.'s mother during the making of "Summer With Monika") is about the only person to receive kind or generous words in the book. 
For a really icy chill, consider Mr. Bergman's description of Greta Garbo past her prime: "Her mouth was ugly, a pale slit surrounded by transverse wrinkles. 
It was strange and disturbing. 
All that beauty and in the middle of the beauty a shrill discord. 
No plastic surgeon or makeup man could conjure away that mouth and what it told me." 

   The man is cruel. 

   Reading this autobiography may prove an unnerving experience to those for whom "Wild Strawberries," "Smiles of a Summer Night" and "The Seventh Seal" affectionately are seminal film memories of youth. 
Mr. Bergman shows us their creator as a man eaten alive by his demons: cold, selfish, petty, mean. 
Mr. Bergman does tell us he knew he had persuasive powers, "that I could make people do what I wanted them to do, that I had some kind of surface charm which I could switch on and off at will." 

   Indeed, in reading these memoirs I had to remind myself constantly that when I spent many hours in his company about 20 years ago, I found him one of the most charming individuals I had ever met. 
At the time, Mr. Bergman said that he could not bear dealing with his own male peers. 
Only men much younger or much older were acceptable to him. 
If he discovered they were disadvantaged in some way, say, by being homosexual or Jewish, this discovery seemed to relax him socially. 
So too with women he appeared to enjoy this edge of advantage. 
Women also fascinated him almost as a species. 
He would become utterly absorbed getting to know a woman. 
His interest and curiosity had no bounds. 
Perhaps at 70, however, Mr. Bergman feels the need to charm is over. 
There is certainly no charm at all in this book. 

   Mr. Bergman seems to be saying: Here I am, a thoroughly hateful individual. 
Take me as I am -- if you can. 
He lays out evidence in abundance, even to telling how at age 15 in Weimar, Germany, he took part in a Nazi rally. 
"I shouted like everyone else, held out my arm like everyone else, howled like everyone else and loved it like everyone else." 
The speaker at the rally was Adolf Hitler. 
"I loved {Hitler}," says Mr. Bergman. 
"For many years, I was on Hitler's side, delighted by his successes and saddened by his defeats." 
His brother was one of the founders and organizers of the Swedish National-Socialist Party, and several times his father voted for the party's candidates. 
It was only well after the war that the now-adult Bergman finally accepted that the concentration camps were not "prearranged propaganda lies." 

   Still, at 70, Mr. Bergman faces into the dark night, "neither able nor willing to imagine another life, some kind of life beyond the frontier -- the perspective is appalling." 
He ends his autobiography with an entry purportedly from his mother's diary, a few days after his birth. 
"I pray to God with no confidence. 
One will probably have to manage alone as best one can."

1957 BERGMAN CLASSIC RELATES INNER JOURNEY

Dreaming is emblematic of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries." This masterful 
Swedish director at first submerges us in his old hero's nightmare, and later, 
the film finds its own dimension where reality is often enveloped by fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes set the tone and course for this 1957 movie, screening tonight 
at UC Irvine. Hallucinatory is one way to describe the beginning, as we're 
introduced to Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), a 78-year-old doctor known for his 
toughness. He's lying in bed, having a dream that eventually becomes a 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Isak is wandering down a street. Everything seems calm, but then Bergman 
lays out a series of metaphors -- timepieces without hands; a rushing, 
out-of-control hearse drawn by black horses; a pervading isolation that comes 
from the deserted town square. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearse crashes, a coffin falls out. The corpse, suddenly alive, 
reaches out to Isak, who sees that it's he who is dead. He wakes up with 
thoughts of his mortality and decides to drive instead of fly to a distant 
university where he will be given an honorary degree. 
</P>
<P>
Isak takes along his lovely daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin) and picks up three 
young hitchhikers (Bibi Andersson, Bjorn Bjelvenstam and Folke Sundquist) after 
they stop at his boyhood home. All three, especially the girl among them, are 
spirited, and their presence revitalizes Isak. 
</P>
<P>
Isak and his companions are now traveling in the real world, but Isak can't 
escape the earlier dream. The foreshadowing becomes overshadowing as Bergman 
thrusts Isak into several dreamlike reveries, juxtaposing the present with his 
uneasy past. The trip becomes an odyssey of self-revelation, regret and 
grudging acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Seventh Seal," which was released a year before, "Wild Strawberries" 
initially baffled many critics, who found the symbolism too personal and 
arcane. It did poorly in limited release in America but soon became a favorite 
of the art houses. Bergman's early films, like those of Fellini, were the first 
international cult movies. 
</P>
<P>
The critics' complaints seem odd now. Bergman's vision is unique, but there's a 
universal sweep to Isak's self-absorption and the way the director describes it 
that speaks to everyone who has considered the path of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
This is, to be sure, a film of great melancholy and introspection without a 
happy or heroic resolution. At times, all the pondering freezes the action, 
requiring our patience and attention. "Wild Strawberries," a true classic, is 
as far away from an easy Hollywood movie as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
It has much to offer, from Bergman's exploration of the narrative form to the 
script's reliance on the subconscious for inspiration. On a scholarly level, 
the film displays Bergman's career-long preoccupations with death, spiritual 
truth and rejuvenation. They've become his signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" will be screened tonight at 7 and 9 at UC 
Irvine's Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium as part of the UCI Film Society 
Directors' Personal Portraits series. Tickets: $2 to $4. (714) 856-6379.

THE BEST INTENTIONS (12) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill
THE RAPTURE (18) MGMs West End
THE INNER CIRCLE (15) Odeon Haymarket
CASABLANCA (U) Empire
It is Cannes Film festival delivery fortnight. A week after the film that by
wide consent should have won the 1992 Golden Palm, Robert Altman's The
Player, we welcome to Britain the film that did win the Golden Palm, Bille
August's The Best Intentions.
In the auteurist shorthand used and abused today, we say 'Altman's' and
'August's' films. But The Player owed much of its crackle to Michael
Tolkin's script from his own novel. (For more about Mr T read on in this
column.) And The Best Intentions boasts a script by Ingmar Bergman based on
the lives of his own parents. Who is to call it an August film rather than a
Bergman film?
It is certainly a long film. Three hours, and even that a digest of the
six-hour serial version simultaneously prepared for TV. If pressed against a
wall by a man with a gun, I would say that in some respects The Best
Intentions is not a film at all: more a roman fleuve in pictures about the
love between a rich girl with a possessive family, played by Pernilla August
 -the director's wife, who won the Cannes best actress prize - and a young
pastor with a blond moustache and a live-in guilt complex (Samuel Frohler).
Yet 20 minutes into this story, we scarcely care what aesthetic category we
put it into. Film or mini-series, family album or novel-with-pictures, it
surges majestically through the century's early years as Bergman recreates
the bitter-sweet romance of his mother Anna and father Henrik. Henrik is a
cold-eyed Lutheran priest, Anna a walking nervous breakdown. Between them,
in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye, they create the conditions
of elegiac dementia in which young Ingmar could be born.
This is a prequel to Fanny And Alexander. Some of the same gusty relatives
tack and billow across the screen, as turbulent variations are played on the
theme of family life. Anna's folk are wealth-encrusted Swedish bourgeoisie,
from raspy old Papa (Max Von Sydow) who watches the distant trains from his
mound of rugs by the window, to melting-eyed Mama, a pudgy former beauty who
hides reserves of malice in the folds of her outward kindness. Meanwhile
Henrik's Mama is a dotty old peasant woman living in the wilds and his
departed father has been replaced by an invisible, implacable,
incomprehensible God.
The defects of the parents are visited on the children and children's
children. As Henrik and Anna quarrel in their snowbound parish, which looks
as if it is a sermon's throw from the North Pole, their little son (Ingmar's
older brother) is nearly murdered by the surly ragamuffin they adopt out of
Christian kindness. He is a cousin to all those haunted, stark-eyed urchins
who have prowled through Bergman's films from The Seventh Seal to The
Silence.
Wonderfully elliptical even at its sprawling length, the film never
'explains' unhappiness or inhumanity. It merely exposes it vividly,
impassively, surgically on the snow-white sheet of the story's scenic
operating table.
Bergman the writer has lost none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone
and then beyond to the marrow. Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force;
reconciliations a melting poignancy; silences a terrifying ambiguity. If The
Best Intentions is less than the best of Bergman as a film - less than Hour
Of The Wolf or Persona or Fanny And Alexander - it is because August is more
skilled at shaping performances than shaping screen pictures. Bergman would
have let the madness of human hope and despair spill out into the lighting
and camerawork. August merely records that madness in the performances, but
the performances at best, especially from Mrs August, are richness enough.
If God is a supporting villain in The Best Intentions, he is the
arch-villain in Michael Tolkin's The Rapture. The writer of The Player wrote
and directed this electrifying fable about the evils of Christian
fundamentalism. Made on a mini-budget, it is part satire, part melodrama,
part visionary B-movie. One can imagine the moguls licking their lips. 'She
was only a switchboard operator,' the advertising copyline might run, 'but
she found a hot line to Heaven.'
The film's crazed primitivism is its strength. Mimi Rogers, who is fast
turning into today's Barbara Stanwyck, plays the telephone employee who
gives up her life as a daytime drudge and night-time debauchee - attending
swinger orgies with her suavely greying boyfriend Patrick Bauchau - when God
calls her 'collect'.
Will she pay for the call? Yes indeed. A bright light, a vision, a death;
then the poignant pleadings of her little daughter. Soon Miss R is out in
the desert waiting for God to snatch up her and the little one in a
pre-Judgment Day 'rapture.' But God moves in mysterious ways, especially
when He is the God of America's born-again fundamentalists. Even when
Gabriel's horn sounds in the film's astonishing finale, mystical
triumphalism is nowhere in sight. And the horsemen of the apocalypse pound
unfeeling through the mires of human grief and disenchantment.
If I spell out more of the plot, your own astonishment will be ruined. The
Rapture has a few first-time film-maker's faults: the over-urgent piling on
of saleable ingredients (sex, drugs, sudden death), too many
plonk-the-camera-down dialogue scenes. But it also has a first-time
film-maker's miraculous innocence. Scenes that a veteran would claim you
'could not do' are carried off here with a sublime insouciance.
The message of the film is that miracles do not happen: or not the useful,
daily miracles we pray for as distinct from the global magic act we all
await on Judgment Day. But this film is a miracle of its kind: a story that
pierces the veil between here and the beyond with a rough magic far more
powerful than the whimsical mysticism we have grown used to with Ghost and
company.
The Inner Circle is set in a city where everyone speaks English with a
strenuous Russian accent. It is Moscow in the 1940s, where according to
writer-director Andrei Konchalovsky (Maria's Lovers, Runaway Train) a young
man in the likeness of Tom Hulce served as film projectionist to a man with
a walrus moustache and Oriental eye make-up called Joseph Stalin (Alexandre
Zbruev).
While our hero falls under the tyrant's evil spell, his wife (Lolita
Davidovich) busies herself swinging between liberal goodheartedness - she
pays forbidden visits to a sickly-sentimental Jewish orphan (Bess Meyer) -
and cynical despair. In the latter mode, she lends her body to Bob Hoskins,
alias KGB chief Beria. They make love in his private train compartment as
the rolling-stock of history rattles towards Stalin's final days.
The first film ever shot in the corridors of the KGB, let alone Beria's
train compartment, The Inner Circle is also the umpteenth film to turn
truth-based political tragedy into dial-a-cliche melodrama. Overacted by
almost everyone in sight and scripted for stark risibility - 'F---off' says
Stalin to a VIP petitioner early on and the dialogue does not improve - it
comes to life only when raiding history direct. The climactic scenes of
people literally trampled to death in the crowds jostling towards Uncle
Joe's coffin shows the grim punishment that awaits a nation that misjudges
its leader during his life and turns misjudgment into deification after his
death.
Casablanca is 50 years old and has also undergone deification. But no
misjudgment here: the film is still a classic. Re-opening in a new 35-mm
print, it reanimates Bogart, Bergman and company and sets them dancing
through Rick's Cafe Americain as the dialogue crackles, the romance revs and
Dooley Wilson at the piano keeps telling us we must remember this. Who on
earth could forget?

<TEXT>
   Director Ingmar Bergman has said it took him 50
years to find someone to play his kind of Hamlet.
   The man he chose to portray Shakespeare's melancholy Dane was a
lanky, lean and wild-haired actor named Peter Stormare who, until
he was 22, had never seen a play.
   ``I grew up in the middle of nowhere,'' the 34-year-old Stormare
said recently, describing the small Swedish village of Arbro where
he was raised. ``It was football or drinking wine and beer or going
around in cars. You were not allowed to say `No, I'm staying home
this Saturday night to read a poem or try to write a novelette or
do a painting.' I did have that inside me.''
   It took a while, but Stormare is now a leading member of the
Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden, a world-class theater troupe that
is best known to Americans as the company which staged the world
premiere of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in
1956.
   Stormare's Hamlet, directed by Bergman, will be seen in the
United States June 8-16 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music before the
Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden moves on to a tour of Japan and
the Soviet Union.
   Stormare looks more like a rock said. ``He was the only stagehand I
met who wanted an explanation or a motivation for bringing a chair
on stage.''
   When he wasn't moving the scenery about, Stormare took acting
lessons from Wigren.
   ``We started with a four-line poem that's very well known in
Sweden,'' Stormare remembers. ``I struggled with that poem for half
a year, trying to understand it. It's a wonderful little poem but I
hate it now.''
   Finally, Stormare was accepted by the drama school which usually
only admits 12 students out of the more than 1,000 that apply each
year.
   ``If you want to become a good actor in Sweden, you go there,''
Stormare says. He stayed for three years, taking classes for 10
months of the year.
   ``I was like a kid at a fair,'' Stormare recalls. ``The school
had everything for its students. Even guitars. We often spent the
nights playing the guitar.''
   When he graduated, Stormare joined the Royal Dramatic Theater.
Critics and audiences first noticed him in a production of ``Class
Enemy'' by British playwright Nigel Williams. Bergman also saw his
galvanizing portrayal of a young London street punk.
   The 69-year-old director cast him in a small role in the film
``Fanny and Alexander.'' Stormare later appeared in Bergman's stage
productions of ``King Lear'' and ``Miss Julie.'' Their latest
project together has been a critically praised revival of ``Long
Day's Journey into Night'' in which Stormare plays the troubled son
Edmund.
   ``Bergman is possessed by storytelling,'' says Stormare,
explaining why the man is such a great director. ``It's a kind of
simplicity. In a way, he uses plays and films to tell his own
story. His heart is in everyone. That's what makes him so
international.''

   In her native country, Greta Garbo was
remembered with pride today as an actress whose charisma made her
``the world's best known Swedish emigrant.''
   ``I do not know what it was that made everybody turn around and
keep looking at her when we entered a restaurant,'' Garbo's
longtime friend Mimi Pollack said on Swedish national radio.
   Ms. Pollack and Garbo were fellow students at Stockholm's Royal
Theater School in the early 1920s. Ms. Pollack said they had not
been in touch since Garbo fell ill this winter.
   Swedish film professor Leif Furhammar said he remembered her as
a someone ``who walks down the stairs in such a way that you cannot
take your eyes off her.''
   Torsten Jungstedt, a Swedish film critic, told the Swedish
national news agency TT that Garbo's ``face was perfect for film.
It was a close shot face with an enormous amount of life in it.''
   ``Photographers said it had a light of its own,'' he said.
   Garbo died Sunday in a New York hospital. She was 84.
   She grew up in Soder, a workers' district in southern Stockholm.
Director Mauritz Stiller discovered her at the Royal Theater
School. Stiller and Pollack persuaded her to change her name from
Greta Gustafsson to Greta Garbo.
   Garbo was the first of several Swedes who made international
film careers, including director Ingmar Bergman, and actors Ingrid
Bergman, Max von Sydow, Bibi Andersson, Anita Ekberg, and most
recently Lena Olin.
   Stiller had gone with Garbo to Hollywood in 1925 and tried to
bring her back to Sweden when he returned two years later. But she
stayed on and later became an American citizen, returning to Sweden
to visit only occasionally.

<HEAD>Talent Agent Paul Kohner Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood agent Paul Kohner, who represented
such diverse talents as Charles Bronson, Ingmar Bergman and John
Huston, has died of heart failure. He was 85.
   Kohner died Wednesday at University of California, Los Angeles,
Medical Center, said John Strauss, a longtime associate. His wife,
former Mexican film star Lupita Tovar, and family members were at
his bedside.
   Until a recent illness, Kohner headed the Paul Kohner agency,
which celebrates its 50th anniversary in May.
   Throughout his career, Kohner represented hundreds of stars,
espcecially Europeans, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich,
Maurice Chevalier, Liv Ullman, Max von Sydow and Klaus Maria
Brandauer.
   In addition to his native Czechoslovakian, Kohner spoke Italian,
German, Spanish, French and English. He frequently traveled abroad.
   Over the past 20 years, Kohner was instrumental in bringing all
of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's films to the United States,
Strauss said.
   During World War II Kohner helped organize the European Film
Fund, later the European Relief Fund, which provided emigre artists
with financial assistance and help in obtaining visas to come to
the United States.
   Kohner was born in Teplitz Schoenau, in what is now
Czechoslovakia.
   While working as a reporter for his father's film industry trade
newspapers in 1920, Kohner interviewed then-head of Universal
Pictures Carl Laemmle and came away with the promise of a job in
New York.
   He came to the United States the same year and worked in various
departments at Universal, including publicity, promotion,
distribution and production. Eventually he produced
foreign-language films for the studio, both in the United States
and in Europe.
   Among the more important English films he produced were ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' starring Lon Chaney; ``A House
Divided,'' directed by William Wyler; ``The Chinese Parrot,''
starring Conrad Veidt; and ``Love Me and the World is Mine,''
starring Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry.
   He is survived by his wife; daughter Susan Kohner Weitz; son
Paul J. ``Pancho'' Kohner; four grandchildren and a brother, Walter.
   Funeral services will be Sunday at Hillside Memorial Park.

   The blond giant stood tentatively on the stage
of the Place des Artes theater, seemingly amazed at the standing
ovation accorded him by the packed audience.
   Max Von Sydow had come to the Montreal World Film Festival for a
tribute to his 30-year career that has brought distinction to
movies on both sides of the Atlantic. The program included clips
from two widely divergent films: Ingmar Bergman's ``The Virgin
Spring'' (1959) and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986).
   A dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the
Danish-made ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which drew the Motion Picture
Academy's best foreign-language film Oscar of 1988 as well as a
nomination as best actor for Von Sydow. He received a second
standing ovation when he left the stage.
   ``It's very strange,'' he admitted afterward. ``I don't know how
you feel, but I feel like I'm 25 inside. I don't feel that I have
any kind of `lifetime achievement.'''
   Film critics would argue with that. If he had appeared only in
the Bergman films, Von Sydow would have earned a place in movie
history. But he also has contributed a series of noteworthy
performances in a wide variety of films, from the profound (Jesus
Christ in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'') to the eerie (``The
Exorcist'') to the frivolous (Ming the Merciless in ``Flash
Gordon'').
   Like most successful actors, Von Sydow's career was the result
of a series of happy accidents. He was born 60 years ago in Lund,
Sweden, the son of a university professor and his wife. Max
happened to see some plays in nearby Malmo, prompting him to enroll
in dramatic classes at high school. After his two-year military
service, he enrolled in the Royal Academy, training ground for such
famous Swedes as Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman.
   Von Sydow played repertory at the Malmo Municipal Theater, where
Bergman had been hired as chief director. When Bergman filmed ``The
Seventh Seal,'' he chose the young actor as a returning Crusader.
The pair collaborated on 11 films.
   George Stevens was impressed with Von Sydow's strong, mystical
persona and cast him in the mammoth, unrealized ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told.'' ``Hawaii'' with Julie Andrews was also a
disappointment, but the two films established Von Sydow as an
international star. He has been working all over the world ever
since.
   Before leaving Montreal for a new film in Australia, Von Sydow
paused for an interview with The Associated Press:
   Q. You have now directed your first film, ``Katinka.'' How did
you like being on the other side of the camera?
   A. ``It was a great experience, very exciting. I had never had
any plans to become a director, but this was something very
special. It dealt with a novel I had found a long time ago; I fell
in love with it immediately and saw it as a film with me playing a
part in it.
   ``I tried to convince my director friends, but nobody caught on
to it. Then someone approached me to direct the film, and I
couldn't turn it down. I was too old to play one of the parts,
unfortunately. Time does these things to you. It was a great
experience, exhausting, but I learned a lot.''
   Q. At the tribute you mentioned that the first 20 years as an
actor were a kind of therapy for you. What did you mean?
   A. ``I have a feeling that many actors choose acting because
there's something they long for but cannot reach, that there's
something they cannot express in their private lives, that there's
a threshold they cannot pass.
   ``I was a very shy boy when I was a kid. I had difficulty to
communicate with people I didn't know. When I started acting in an
amateur group in high school, although I wasn't aware of it at the
time, I suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful. I was
allowed to express all kinds of strange things that I never dared
to express before. Now I could do it with the character as a
shield, as a defense, and as an excuse.
   ``I think that for many years I used my profession as some kind
of a mental therapy. I worked all the time, and I needed it. I was
restless, and I was very crazy if I was not allowed to work.
Through the years I have backed off. Life has helped me, and my
friends and my wife and my family. Today I don't need that therapy
anymore.''
   Q. The acting life has sent you all over the world. Did you
expect that when you started out?
   A. ``No, that happened later. It has its advantages and its
drawbacks. But that can be very exciting. I'm grateful because I've
seen so much of the world that I wouldn't have seen otherwise. But
sometimes you get a little too much of hotel rooms and suitcases
and packing and unpacking. I think I'll try to take it a little
easier in the future.
   ``I'm planning to do more theater, at least one production a
year, limited engagement.''
   Q. Where is home nowadays?
   A. ``My home is in Paris. Funny thing is that I haven't spent
much time there because I've been working elsewhere. We have an
apartment which I like very much. It's a wonderful old palace in
the old quarter of Paris. It's where Beaumarchais wrote `The
Marriage of Figaro.' It has been remodeled, and we have the attic
of the house.
   ``We also have a summer place in Sweden, and summer in Sweden is
very important. I guess I am more of a country boy than a city boy,
even though I grew up in a small town.''
   Q. Your world travels have caused separations from your family,
right?
   A. ``Not always, but for long periods. My wife comes along when
I go to places she thinks she will enjoy. It's not easy. But I have
a good wife, and we like each other very much. We have managed to
stay together.''

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman's Production of `Hamlet' Travels to Brooklyn</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing is quite what it should be in the world
created by director Ingmar Bergman for his startling, violent and
often mesmerizing production of ``Hamlet'' which arrived this week
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for an eight-performance run.
   In Bergman's unnerving creation for the Royal Dramatic Theater
of Sweden, Denmark becomes an environment of decay, sexual excess,
psychotic behavior and ultimately needless slaughter carried out to
ear-bursting pop music and the whir of minicams and tape recorders.
   Elsinore has been transformed into a castle of lost souls where
a drunken king and queen have sex in public while the court titters
and applauds, Polonius preaches like a stuffy British barrister,
Ophelia becomes a disheveled flower child gone mad, the Gravedigger
turns into an existential comic waiting for Godot and Fortinbras
storms the stage as a black-bereted guerrilla leader.
   At the center of Bergman's chaos stands a tall, dark, brooding
Hamlet who would not look out of place in one of New York's tonier
rock clubs. Dressed entirely in black and wearing sunglasses, the
actor slouches on stage. As played by a fascinating and forceful
actor named Peter Stormare, this Hamlet arrives with a Marlon
Brando swagger and a Norman Bates psychosis.
   Stormare, an intense, hawk-like presence, brings a wild energy
to the 3{-hour production. The actor is not an introspective Hamlet
calmly reasoning out what should be done. This prince rails against
the world and what has happened to the kingdom since his uncle
murdered his father and married his mother.
   When this Hamlet acts, he gets carried away. When he kills
Polonius, he stabs him in the eye and then scrawls the word `blood'
on the wall. When he tells Ophelia to ``get thee to a nunnery,'' he
nearly rapes her in the process.
   There is one radical change in the text, involving the transfer
of one famous speech from one scene to another. When Hamlet is
talking quietly to the player king about how to act out his
father's death, the young prince, overcome with grief, suddenly
breaks down and delivers ``To be or not to be?'' It's an
interesting concept, particularly since the actor portraying the
player king, Per Myrberg, also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father.
   Bergman's production contains some startling imagery, much of it
designed by Goran Wassberg. His setting is simple _ a bare, black
stage, an arc of lights hanging above it and a circle, outlined in
red, placed on the floor at center stage.
   Wassberg's costumes are equally eye-catching, many of them in
shades of red and from different periods of fashion. The contrast
between the old and new underlines the uncertainty that plagues
this royal court.
   Pernilla Ostergren is a touching Ophelia, a child-woman who
remains on stage for much of evening, a forlorn witness to most of
the debauchery. Borje Ahlstedt is a randy, boozy Claudius while
Gunnel Lindblom as Gertrude matches him in every debauchery. Rarely
have these two royal misfits been so ably put on stage.
   The production is performed in Swedish, and the language
difference eventually poses a problem. For audiences familiar with
the English text, Bergman's interpretation of the story should be
readily accessible. But others with no knowledge of the play will
be lost. What's also missing from the production, at least for an
English-speaking audience, is the readily recognizable poetry.
   Still, there are Bergman's startling images of a world gone out
of control. The foreign language may cloud the text, but the
director's particular point of view shines through with a clarity
that makes this ``Hamlet'' a compelling and often haunting evening
of theater.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Ibsen and Bergman - a marriage made in heaven / The
first European theatre festival in Dusseldorf is proving a heady experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Mitterrand paid for it, Giorgio Strehler opened it, and Ingmar
Bergman was the catch of week one. At the first European Theatre Festival
launched last week in Dusseldorf, radical chic has never been more
sparkling. Bergman and Ibsen; Strehler and Goldoni; Brecht directed by his
son in law; a revolutionary Catalan Figaro; from London the RNT's Angels in
America: stars stud the stage, tickets are gold dust, visitors fill smoky
bars for midnight post-mortems. The mood recalls Edinburgh, the variety
Vienna and the quality Salzburg: on the first few days' tasting this new
festival, whose venue will change each year, looks set to become Europe's
most heady and prestigious theatre binge.
Bergman doing Ibsen is a marriage made in heaven, and the Royal Theatre
Stockholm's Peer Gynt offers a rare chance to see film-maker as stage
director. Peer Gynt, its series of frozen scenes in Peer's life unravelled
like magic boxes, is a natural vehicle for cinematic theatricality; in to it
Bergman, always an autobiographical artist, injects a personal vision which
transforms this often wooden piece into an emotional coup de force. A
century on, Bergman's art is rooted in scenes close to Ibsen: moral
integrity; a sense of sin powerfully visualised; individual expression
within claustrophobic relationships; the meeting of dream and reality.
Bergman's set is a sinister red room, centre stage, enclosed within the
larger frame of Peer's home. High, thick wooden walls carved with flowers,
dim gaslights, a grandfather clock, a sturdy crib, hem it in on three sides.
Actions, memories, are compressed into this chamber of the imagination; like
dreams, each seen has its own visual logic. The wedding guests, in flame-red
folk-dress buttoned up to neck and wrists, weighed down with gold brocade
and buckles, hijack the room for a hellish, anti-erotic tap dance full of
jerkily suppressed lunges for freedom. The trolls, green tarts in flounces,
frills and dreadlocks, drag Peer on a rhino to an orgy in a madhouse. They
hang over the roof of the room swinging erect green tails and snorting
lewdly. Sex screams out, Peer hurtles about trying to conceal a huge rubber
penis emerging between his legs.
Later, laser beams focus on top-hatted men in black encircling Peer; their
accusations echo as distortions from loudspeakers across a vast auditorium
and against a chorus of church bells: a choking vision of guilt.
Loneliness, repression and sin are the motifs. Solveig's family, Amish-style
puritans, march in line like geese, fall to their knees chant prayers, a
young child spies on Peer from a doorway. Based on Bergman's own upbringing,
they are as chilling an emblem of cruel rectitude as the father in his film
Fanny and Alexander. Lena Andre's Solveig, symbol of love, unwinds with
conviction and subtlety from torment into a mix of nervousness/grace,
fear/determination.
As Peer, Borje Andersson is Everyman: chubby, dazed, endlessly flexible
face; round, hapless body; a dreamer whose desires are now pathetic, now
comic, now horrifying. He sticks out his tongue at us, drops his trousers at
the whiff of a woman; he is also the desperate loner; seeking warmth,
meaning, justification. A magnificent, inexhaustible performance.
The European Theatre Festival to November 27 at the Dusseldorf,
Schauspielhaus. Festival information 0211 36 87 136.

<HEAD>Esteemed Swedish Actor Turns To London Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish screen star Max Von Sydow, whose new film
``Pelle the Conqueror'' won the grand prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, is turning to the English stage in a career move he
described as ``a great surprise.''
   ``It's very exciting,'' the tall, lanky Von Sydow said of his
upcoming role as Prospero in Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' The
play opens Oct. 6 at London's Old Vic theater for a limited run
through Nov. 26.
   The production, directed by Jonathan Miller, will mark Von
Sydow's first English-language appearance on the London stage. He
previously appeared in Britain in 1974 in a Swedish staging of
Henrik Ibsen's ``The Wild Duck.''
   That production was directed by Ingmar Bergman, with whom Von
Sydow has had a long and illustrious career on stage and in such
films as ``The Seventh Seal,'' ``Wild Strawberries,'' ``Through a
Glass Darkly'' and ``The Passion of Anna.''
   On Broadway, Von Sydow has starred in two flops: ``The Night of
the Tribades,'' with Eileen Atkins and Bibi Andersson, and ``Duet
for One,'' with Anne Bancroft.
   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' Von Sydow, 58, said of
director Miller's choice that he play Prospero, a part more often
associated with English actors in their twilight years.
   Miller, in a separate interview, explained his casting.
   ``I wanted to break out of the noble aria approach English
performers often take to the part,'' said Miller, who is in his
first year as the artistic director of London's venerable Old Vic.
   ``I've never seen Max on stage, but I know he is a great,
accomplished actor. I've seen all his films.''
   Prospero furthers what has been an unusually busy year for Von
Sydow. He is presently appearing at the National Theater of
Stockholm in August Strindberg's 1872 ``Master Olof.''
   In Bille August's prize-winning Danish film, ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' Von Sydow heads up a family of immigrant farmworkers
at the turn of the century, giving a performance for which he's won
critical praise. The film won La Palme D'Or, the top prize, at the
41st annual Cannes Film Festival which ended on May 23.
   Von Sydow was also represented at Cannes with his directorial
debut, ``Katinka,'' adapted from a novel by the Danish author
Herman Bang about a three-way love affair.
   He said he had originally hoped to act in a movie version of the
book when he first read the novel 25 years ago.
   Now, since he was too old for the male leads, he decided to
direct the movie instead: ``Coincidence put the possibility in my
hands.''
   Of his English-language films, Von Sydow said he looked back
fondly on ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' Woody Allen's 1986 movie in
which he played Barbara Hershey's tortured, irascible companion.
   ``Most of the scripts one gets are so bad it was wonderful to
receive one with intelligent dialogue,'' said the actor, who felt
challenged by Allen's requirements.
   ``He (Allen) demands 200 percent of a naturalistic style. He
does not allow any literary phrasings or pronunciation,'' Von Sydow
said.
   This version of ``The Tempest'' will mark the fourth major
production of the play to be seen in England this year; both the
star and his director said they would not be seeing the others.
   ``It's very disturbing to be influenced,'' said Von Sydow, who
last played Shakespeare's conjurer-poet in a Swedish production 35
years ago when, he said, he was ``much too young.''
   Miller said, ``I don't go very much to the theater. It's too
much of a busman's holiday.''

VON SYDOW'S SCENES OF DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY MILLS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This movie is not entertainment," Max Von Sydow says, casting his eye over the 
bloody costumes of dozens of Japanese people lying in a church courtyard. "It's 
much more of a political statement." 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who received a best actor Oscar nomination last year for "Pelle the 
Conqueror," is talking about NBC's "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes," about the 
aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing. It airs at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the 45th 
anniversary of the day the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The pacifist in me made me interested in this project," he says, explaining 
his decision to portray a German Catholic priest working in Hiroshima on Aug. 
6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that we're sometimes reminded of important events in 
history. When Pope John Paul II visited Hiroshima recently, he says, 'We have 
to look to the past to learn for the future."' 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who first came to worldwide notice 35 years ago through the films of 
fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, explains he's not just talking about bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiroshima has become a metaphor not just for nuclear war but for war and 
destruction and violence toward civilians," he says. "It's not just the idea we 
should not use nuclear arms. We should not start another war because it's 
madness." 
</P>
<P>
The scene today in Valencia, which is standing in for Hiroshima, occurs the day 
after the bomb fell. With two wind machines at work blowing smoke and dust in 
the actors' faces, the scene is eerily reminiscent of photographs taken of the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black cassock, Von Sydow busily attends the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb on Hiroshima, which flattened 90% of the city, resulted in nearly 
130,000 casualties. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later prompted 
the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender, bringing an end to World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other movies that have examined America's decision to bomb Japan, the 
focus of "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes" follows the survivors. In the ensemble 
film, Von Sydow shares billing with Judd Nelson (an American POW interned in a 
Hiroshima jail), Pat Morita (a Hiroshima postman), Tamlyn Tomito (a 
Japanese-American whose husband is in the Japanese Army) and Kim Miyori (a 
mother of a missing child). 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow is reluctant to address the moral issues surrounding Hiroshima. "We 
don't know what would have happened if America hadn't dropped the bombs," he 
said. "It's easy to say that no bombs should have been dropped. But this was a 
war situation, and dropping them was an attempt to end the war." 
</P>
<P>
Although Von Sydow, 61, was too young to have fought in World War II, he did 
see its effects first-hand. In 1945 he was a high school student in Sweden, a 
country that remained neutral during the war. "That spring," he recalls, "the 
concentration camps were opened, and members of the Red Cross went in and 
brought a large number of prisoners to southern Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"I belonged to a folk dance group that visited these poor, miserable people and 
performed for them. We were asked to learn a number of national anthems, and we 
sang them. It was an extremely emotional experience. Many of these people were 
in terrible shape. They looked like walking skeletons, but they were beaming 
with joy as we entertained them." 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by such a reception, Von Sydow ignored his parents' plan for him to 
enter college and instead pursued an acting career. "I was in such a hurry to 
be an actor," he remembers. "Now I'm sometimes mad at myself that I didn't stop 
and study for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he attended Stockholm's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, began a stage 
career and then had the good fortune to meet Bergman. His work in the 
director's "The Seventh Seal," "The Magician" and "The Virgin Spring" brought 
him to the attention of Hollywood. In 1965, Von Sydow came to America to play 
Christ in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he has come back periodically 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the title role in "The Exorcist" and a small part in "Hannah and Her 
Sisters," as Barbara Hershey's intellectual lover, most of Von Sydow's work in 
Hollywood films has been villainous. "It's because I'm foreign," he explains in 
his ever-so-lightly accented English, Rand foreigners are very often villains." 
Since the success of "Pelle the Conqueror," an Oscar-winner in 1989 for best 
foreign film, Von Sydow thinks he has a new image in the United States. "Now 
I'm getting less villain offers and more normal people offers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his Hollywood career prospers, Von Sydow, who has lived in Rome and 
Paris for more than a decade, intends to move back to Sweden to pursue stage 
work. "If they want me, I'll do one limited theater engagement there every year 
and films the rest of the time," he says. "It's a daydream, but I hope it will 
work."

Jennie Livingston
Star City, Arkansas, and Rustwater, Kansas, are both small towns near the
middle of America. But look closely - is there a big difference? Exactly.
One is in Jim Thompson country, the other is in Sinclair Lewis country.
Star City is the small town as rural spittoon. In the irresistibly grimy,
downbeat thriller One False Move - scripted by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom
Epperson but surely ghost-dictated by that master of elevated pulp J.
Thompson - the town plays host to fugitive gangsters, dimwitted lawmen and a
climactic carnage that Aeschylus would be proud of.
Up the road a little - go north and bend left - is Rust-water in wheatbelt
Kansas. For displaced urban crime read agriculture under stress. There is a
drought here and the farms are dying; and if one pastoral crisis is not
enough, here comes another. Revivalist preacher Jonas Nightengale (Steve
Martin), comedy-cloned by screenwriter Janus Cercone from Sinclair Lewis's
Elmer Gantry, passes through town with his all-singing, all-praying tent
show. He gives the rain-starved farmers hope; he raiseth the lame and sick
(the language is catching); he thumps his Bible; and he is a frightful,
pearly-teethed fraud made winning by the charismatic Mr Martin.
When films venture outside Los Angeles they usually end up in Cutesville,
USA. See ET, Back To The Future and Co. To Hollywood any place without smog,
faxes and power breakfasts must seem strange and innocent. But One False
Move, by a mile the better of the week's rural twosome, makes a rich dark
joke of this (faux)-navete. At the centre: a young Southern sheriff (Bill
Paxton) intent on proving his mettle to two visiting lawmen (one white, one
black) from Los Angeles. All the Angelenos want to do is to round up a pair
of cocaine-dealing killers (also one black, one white) who massacred a
roomful of people back in LA and then fled with their guns, their drugs and
their girl (Cynthia Williams). Will they come to ground in the girl's home
town of Star City, Ark.?
Not yet. First the movie, directed with sizzling grace by ex-actor Carl
Franklin, travels all over the south-western states as the getaway trio make
for Houston (to sell their drugs) before being harried by police pursuit
into doubling back north for Arkansas. Back here the film's other character
grouping has been in mocking parallel action. For two black/white crooks
with a brown-skinned girl read two black/white city cops with a redneck
sheriff.
The racial patch-quilting, though teasingly displayed, is never deployed for
facile tension. Indeed Southern values are almost respected for their loony
matter-of-factness. Paxton's pinbrained lawman is a creation so ridiculous
it is sublime. He boasts, he bumbles, he preens. And he obliviously throws
out the word 'nigger' while his black colleague pretends polite deafness.
Even the sheriff's wife shakes her head at his intellect, while
simultaneously advertising her own. ('He watches TV, I read non-fiction'.)
And when her man goes off to do what a man's gotta do, the film moves into a
High Noon climax re-staged - brilliantly - as nihilist farce.
One False Move is a rural tragicomedy with the deadly grace of a sidewinder.
Leap Of Faith is more like a stoned python. It folds itself round its
subject's neck, makes some promising hissing noises - and then falls asleep
on the job. We love the sight of Martin dancing into town with his big-band
show of dubious miracles: orchestrated by Debra Winger at the backstage
computer, feeding audience information into Martin's on-stage earpiece. 'Man
in white shirt, hard of hearing', 'Woman in pink with arthritis'. Then the
slapping-on of hands, the customer's fainting fall, the lordy-lordy
paroxysms of ersatz joy.
Unfortunately, something else in the movie soon reveals itself as ersatz. It
is the subplot. Make that two subplots: for while Winger romances the
improbably saintly town sheriff Liam Neeson - so handsome, so gentle, so
liberal (no redneckery in this burg) - Martin makes a play for diner
waitress Lolita Davidovitch. She has a crippled, chess-playing little
brother (Lukas Haas of Witness) who will surely, if Cliff Eidelman's music
has not done the job by then, end by melting his and our hearts.
Can a real miracle happen? Yes indeed. For lo, the cinema exit doors finally
open before we have all passed out with terminal queasiness. Director
Richard Pearce (Heartland, No Mercy) delivers the razzle-dazzle in the
revivalist set pieces, with Martin exploding all over stage. But no
star-director team can keep their anti-twaddle guns firing in the face of
both the appointed target - high-sleaze evangelism - and a whole lot of
late, unscheduled fire from Hollywood inspirationalism.
* You cannot escape small-town life even, or especially, in Sweden. Sven
Nykvist's The Ox is about pastoral bigotry and brutalism. A terrible fate
befalls Helge Roos (Stellan Skarsgard) when he kills a neighbour's ox to
feed himself and his family during Sweden's 1860s famine. Flogged and
life-sentenced to hard labour, he is then betrayed by his starving wife for
the sake of their starving child. Nor, gentle reader, does the horror stop
there . . .
This truth-based tragedy of errors makes Thomas Hardy seem like Louisa May
Alcott. It also makes for spellbinding cinema. Writer-director Nykvist is
best-known as a cameraman to the great and famous, having lensed 22 Ingmar
Bergmans, three (serious) Woody Allens and a Tarkovsky.
After a training like that, manic depression or emergent movie mastery can
be the only outcome. Nykvist here makes images that burn the eye. The early
winter scenes are inspired crayon-and-charcoal sketches, all ashy clouds,
ember-yellow sunsets and crispy, silhouetted blacks. They are followed by
the desaturated, mold-grey prison scenes, resembling a mortuarist's photo
album. And even when the film bounces back briefly to May-time, the colours
are caustic, garish, mocking.
Assembling his cast from the Ingmar Bergman Who's Who of Acting - Liv
Ullman, Max Von Sydow, Erland Josephson and Fanny And Alexander's Ewa
Frohling as the wife - Nykvist kneads the faces with light and shadow as a
baker kneads dough. There is no flicker of false emotion as he shapes the
story into a picture of provincial life both cruelly plausible and
sumptuously satirical. Von Sydow's dithery priest and Ullman's lady of the
manor, specialising in milky-eyed looks and arm's-length kindness, show the
tattered raiment of charity in times of social despair. And Stellan
Skarsgard, an actor whose flayed looks and sleep-robbed eyes haunt the mind,
finds Dostoevskian depth in the hapless ox-killer. In sum: a triumph.
Is there anything else? Yes, but if you have a bus to catch I can run
through them quickly. Best Of The Best 2 is the sequel to a film no one
seems to have seen. Reportedly it starred Eric Roberts (Julia's brother) and
Chris Penn (Sean's brother), now re-teamed for 90 minutes of cheerful drivel
as two kickboxers trying to kick an evil wall of muscle called Brakus (Ralph
Moeller). Place: Las Vegas. Toupee'd Wayne Newton, looking mature enough to
be Isaac's brother, steals the show as the sleazy emcee.
You can always see the three-year-old drag documentary Paris Is Burning at
the ICA. Director Jennie Livingston shows us round New York's 'vogueing'
couples, as the entire black and Hispanic poulations of Brooklyn and Harlem
seem to have spent 1990 coming out and loudly refusing to go back in again.
Bold, if rather old, stuff.

   BORLANGE, Sweden -- Drinking alone at the Saga Nightclub,
Charlotte Eriksson drifts back to her days as a living
legend.
   "As soon as American guys heard I was Swedish, you could
read their minds," says the 19-year-old drama student, who
spent three of her teen-age years in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"They expected me to leap right into their bed. That, or leap
out the window and kill myself."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tapping her foot to the music, Ms. Eriksson scans the bar
for possible dance partners. "Sometimes," she sighs, going
back to her beer, "I wish Sweden was as thrilling as its
reputation."
   In the beginning, Odin and Frigg begat Thor -- and
Scandinavia begat myths that have multiplied ever since. With
the Norse gods came Vikings: fierce men in bear furs, prone
to rape and pillage. Gradually, the Nordic image thawed,
spawning new emblems. Norway has fiords. The Danish have
pastries. Sweden has suicide and sin.
   "I imagined beautiful blondes climbing all over me as soon
as I got off the airplane," says Michael Rosenblum, a New
York television producer now working in Stockholm. "What a
joke] A lot of them aren't even blond."
   Staring glumly at the cold crayfish on his dinner plate,
he adds: "You can see why they kill themselves. This is the
most boring, depressing place I've ever been."
   Swedes themselves are uneasy with their image, which they
blame on the movies. People see Max von Sydow playing chess
with Death in "The Seventh Seal." They recall the soft-core
porn film "I Am Curious Yellow." They remember Greta Garbo
and Ingrid Bergman. They think Swedes are like their movie
stars. Well, yes and no.
   Separating fact and fiction takes some doing. It is true,
for instance, that most native Swedes are blond. Swedes in
large numbers also are good-looking, though obviously that is
subjective. (Many Swedish men find Norwegian women more
appealing.) And Swedes, generally speaking, have very
permissive attitudes toward birth control, premarital sex and
unmarried couples living together.
   "Blondes don't have more fun," says Nina Yderberg a
Stockholm medical student, who is tall, blond and stunning.
She recently got so bored with her love life that she wrote a
magazine piece maintaining that "Swedish men are such bad
lovers, I'd rather sleep with women." The article, which
includes unflattering samples of male pillow talk, has
brought the 25-year-old a lot of attention, none of it
amorous. "I haven't even kissed a man in months," she says.
   Sex isn't the only thing that Swedes complain is
overrated. Young people in particular gripe that their
bureaucratic social-welfare society is over-engineered -- a
sort of Volvo writ large: safe, staid, the ultimate family
vehicle. And many speak enviously of the excitements to be
had abroad, where people are less formal and the night life
more exciting.
   "This country is cold and gray, and I'm not just talking
about the weather," says sex therapist Malena Ivrsson, who is
married to a Yugoslav. Adds writer and social critic Jan
Myrdal: "We're almost irrationally rational. It's hard to get
an emotional response from a Swede."
   Television host Robert Aschberg agrees. He recently
invited nudists and anti-nudists to appear together on his
show. The nudists disrobed and, to spice the debate, he asked
the anti-nudists to do as much themselves. They did. Mr.
Aschberg thought the program would cause a stir. It didn't.
   "Nine people stark-naked on TV, and no one cared," he
says. "Not one angry letter or phone call. Nothing."
   In summer, Swedish women routinely go topless at beach and
pool, as do women elsewhere in Europe. But contrary to some
visitors' expectations, strip clubs and sex shops in
Stockholm are rare and discreet -- no competition for
Amsterdam or Copenhagen, tame compared to New York.
Prostitutes are almost demure. Eva, a 24-year-old making the
rounds of a park near Stockholm's Opera, tries to lure a
foreign visitor by representing herself as "a Swedish sex
machine." But dressed in denims, a windbreaker and Reeboks,
she looks more like a gym teacher than a Toulouse-Lautrec
lady of the evening.
   "Swedish men don't want you looking like a prostitute,"
she explains. "Anyway, I'd freeze in hot pants and halter
top." Asked to describe her clients, she responds, "Your
basic Swedish meatballs. Polite, efficient, no passion --
same as out of bed."
   Swedish levelheadedness extends to, and flows from, social
policy. Sweden was the first country to introduce sex
education in schools. Contraception is freely available to
teen-agers, without parental consent. And teen-agers often
bring friends home to bed, even when parents are on the
premises.
   "Most parents feel this is better than having their
children freeze in cars or parks," says Katarina Lindahl, who
heads Sweden's National Association for Sexual Information.
   The permissiveness doesn't seem to encourage promiscuity.
A 1988 survey asked Swedes 16 to 23 years of age to name the
most important thing in relationships. Only 1% cited "good
sexual relations." In part because of contraception, rates of
teen-age pregnancy are comparatively low, and falling. A
survey of Swedish women 20 to 30 found that they had, on
average, five sex partners in their entire lives.
   But the news hasn't made it abroad. During a recent trip
to London, 19-year-old Lotta Strand was asked by a British
man to record a message for his answering machine. He thought
her Swedish accent would "sound sexy," she says.
   Ms. Strand, who lives in Stockholm, refused. And she has a
new way of warding off unwanted advances from foreign men. "I
tell them I'm from Iceland," she says. "Saying you're Swedish
is suicide."
   An apt image, some would suggest. Sweden, particularly in
winter, seems a stage set for suicide. The country has long,
dark, snowy winters that keep people indoors, often with a
bottle of aquavit to keep them company.
   Swedes, reserved around strangers, can indeed seem gloomy.
"Our national character is best described as Lutheran
melancholia," says Lars Hellsten, a teacher of literature and
philosophy. "The real question," he adds, with a smile, "is
why don't all Swedes kill themselves?"
   Actually, not a remarkable number do. In 1987, Sweden's
suicide rate was 18.4 per 100,000 people, which is about par
for industrialized countries. The U.S. rate was a relatively
low 12.7. Hungarians do themselves in at twice the rate of
Swedes.
   Historians say that Sweden's undeserved reputation began
with a speech by President Eisenhower at the 1960 Republican
National Convention in which he referred to a socialist
country in the north where "suicide has gone up almost
unbelievably." He was trying to discredit Sweden's welfare
state, and the suicide myth has survived ever since, with
evident help from Ingmar Bergman, the writer and director of
depressing movies.
   So what is the true Swedish vice?
   "We don't have one, that's the problem," says Anders
Sjogren, a business consultant and part-time therapist.
"We're so busy being reliable and boring that we don't have
time for sin."
   Speaking for himself, Mr. Sjogren thinks he knows of an
antidote to ennui. "I hear California girls are really
something," he says. "Maybe I'll go there someday, learn to
surf, meet a blonde."

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: An apology for a film festival / Finding two survivors
and a stretcher case at Cannes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY THE other night Cannes had something worth shouting about.
'Magnifique]' cried a thousand festivalgoers as they watched. 'Sensational]'
'Sacre bleu]' 'The best thing we have seen so far' (Translate into the
languages of your choice).
The cause of passion was a firework display. As bouquets of light burst over
the bay, we all wondered why it had taken twenty-odd tons of gunpowder to
prise open emotional responses left untouched by the films. This spectacle
was a film in part. But what a film: laser-projected images of fire and war
and clinching couples - Gable and Leigh, Garbo and Boyer, even Krushchev and
Castro - thrown onto a giant floating screen as the real fireworks exploded
all around.
They say that human beings are united by adversity. But Cannes,
pre-fireworks, had been the grimmest get-together in Cote d'Azur memory.
Normally goodhearted festivalgoers avoided each other's eyes lest colleagues
had even worse tales of aesthetic debacle to tell than they. 'Did you see
the Icelandic film about despair in the fishing industry?' (Asdid
Thorodssen'd Island). 'No, but I bet it wasn't as bad as that talkative
Canadian movie about the gay murderer who drones on about why he killed his
lover with a kitchen knife' (Jean Baudin's Being At Home With Claude).
'Well, at least it wasn't an ice pick. Do you know, I just saw the 23rd film
in which . . '
Enough. From a festival resembling an unpleasant accident, let me pick out
two unscathed survivors and one partial stretcher-case that smiled for the
cameras. From Sweden Bille August's Best Intentions has a script by - oh how
we need him now - Ingmar Bergman. The film surges majestically through the
century's early years as Bergman recreates the romance and marriage of his
own parents. He is a cold-eyed Lutheran pastor, she a walking nervous
breakdown. Between them, in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye,
they create the conditions of elegiac dementia into which young Ingmar could
be born.
This is a prequel to Fanny And Alexander. It is also a flexi-movie in the
same vein. A 4-hour TV serial co-exists with the three-hour film seen at
Cannes; and indeed our only reservation is that we feel we could buy this
story by the yard. (Why not five hours - seven - ten?) But Bergman has lost
none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone and beyond to the marrow.
Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force; reconciliations a melting poignancy.
As for director Bille August, he was the last non-American to win a Cannes
Golden Palm with Pelle The Conqueror and he may be the first non-American to
end Hollywood's three-year run in 1992.
The other alive-and-kicking festival item, shown non-competitively in the
Directors Fortnight, was Stacey Cochrane's My New Gun: a blissful black
comedy about a young New Jersey suburbanite (Diane Lane) whose life is
transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband
(Stephen Collins).
Direct and indirect results: two woundings, one near-fatal case of food
poisonning, the discovery of a lost Country and Western singer in hiding
(Tess Harper), an adulterous romance and a friends' wedding that almost
models itself on one of those famous bloodbath nuptials beloved of Dynasty.
The film is sly, wise and very very funny. So at best, with its
spot-the-star cast and trigger-happy satirical zest, is Bob Roberts. Tim
Robbins, deified by Cannes as the star of Robert Altman's anti-Hollywood
spoof The Player (current Golden Palm favourite), wrote, directed and gave
himself the lead role in this Awful Warning romp about a pop singer turned
neo-fascist senatorial candidate.
Gore Vidal turns up as a waspish political veteran and Giancarlo Esposito as
a radical black journalist; plus Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Alan Rickman
and more stars than you can find walking the Croisette. If you were watching
for political subtlety, you would leave after five minutes. Robbins's
targets are made of straw and he peppers them with a blunderbuss. But the
film boasts a snazzy storytelling style - all Steadicam bustle and spitfire
close-ups - and makes deft use of newsreel mock-ups in the style of Citizen
Kane.
Elsewhere, films are going down with all hands at Cannes 1992. Even the ones
that begin with a blaze of ambition - like Vincent Ward's globe-hopping
Eskimo-makes-good tale Map Of The Human Heart or Fernando Solanas's sardonic
history of post-Columbian America The Voyage - are soon sinking towards
oblivion. And as films clock up 2-, 3-, 4-hour running times, panic is
caused in the scheduling department. Some critics have turned up for 8 pm
screenings only to be told that the film began at 7. Not surprisingly, they
adjourn to the nearest bar to fill up with four-star Fernet Branca.
Is there a moral in the artistic decrepitude of this festival? Yes. I
suspect we are seeing the convergence of two catastrophic tendencies to
create a Chaos Theory of late-century cinema. To the East as I speak, Europe
is breaking up as a once-rich consortium of individual cultures. It is
becoming a wasteland for co-production carpetbaggers. (Look and quail at
Cannes samples like The Last Butterfly, a Nazi melodrama with Tom Courtenay
adrift in ill-dubbed Czechoslovakia). And to the West, America is hurling at
us its short-attention Video Age no-brainers. Woe upon a festival that has
to open with Basic Instinct and close with the new Tom Cruise vehicle.
No wonder Britain, secure in a middle ground, has contributed two of the
three current favourites for Golden Palm. If you have shirts, prepare to
shred them now. Put one third on Robert Altman's The Player; one third on
Howards End; and one third on Terence Davies's touching self-portrait in
celluloid The Long Day Closes. Screened last night, this proved a hit with
everyone except the French. But then who sets store by the French these
days? They were responsible for mounting this apology for a film festival.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Pelle the Conqueror''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Scandanavians are unsurpassed at filming epic dramas against
the harsh beauty of northern landscapes. Ingmar Bergman has proved
the master of such films. Other contributions have included Jan
Troell's ``The Emigrants'' and ``The New Land'' (about Swedish
farmers in Minnesota), Bo Wilderberg's ``Elvira Madigan'' and last
year's Academy Award winner, ``Babette's Feast.''
   Now ``Pelle the Conqueror'' joins that select group. Written and
directed with rare skill by Danish filmmaker Bille August, it is an
impressive achievement, austere yet reachable, sorrowful but
elevating for the soul. The film displays Max Von Sydow at the peak
of his talent. It's hard to imagine any of the world's actors
performing the role with such conviction.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' (a confusing title suggesting Arnold
Schwarzenwegger in loincloth) is based on the first volume of the
famed saga by Martin Andersen Nexo. The story is told through the
eyes of Pelle (Pelle Hvenegaard), a subteen Swedish boy who
accompanies his widower father, Lasse (Max Von Sydow), on a perilous
adventure early in the century, seeking a new life in the Danish
farm country.
   Their arrival portends the grimness of their future. The farm
owners hire able-bodied immigrants, dismissing Lasse as too old and
his son as too young. Finally the brutal manager of the Stone Farm
agrees to take on the pair.
   Pelle finds his new home both thrilling and forbidding. Like most
outsiders, he is reviled and beaten by his schoolmates. But he is
intrigued by drama all around him: the free spirit who challenges
the foreman and pays for it; the womanizing landowner who is
periodically tainted by the mother of his out-of-wedlock child; the
long-suffering landowner's wife who bestows kindness on Pelle and
savage retribution on her husband.
   The boy also watches with growing sorrow his father's frustration
with his mean existence. Every hope that Lasse uncovers turns to
dust. When he finds a woman who could make a home for him and the
boy, her husband, believed lost at sea, returns. Despairing of his
luck and ashamed of his cowardice, he turns to drink.
   This brief resume might sound depressing, but ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' isn't. August's script is laden with surprises, some
funny, some thrilling, and his camera captures the raw grandeur of
the Danish countryside.
   Von Sydow has never performed more impressively. His Lasse is
downtrodden yet somehow noble, a man befuddled by his inability to
make a better life for himself and his son. Young Hvenegaard, who
never acted before, is miraculous; his bright face mirrors the
wondrous things he sees.
   Released in this country by Mirimax Films, ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' is subtitled in English. There is no rating. Running
time: 138 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Lena Olin was a tomboy. She didn't want to be
pretty. She cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses. She
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties.
   She changed once she turned 13 - no one who's seen ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies, A Love Story'' would
question that. But watch those films, the way she uncorks a wine
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between Olin and other
women and you'll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than
a bowler hat.
   And she hasn't stopped looking for new ways to bring that
quality into her professional life. As a Swedish actress, she's
been compared to Garbo, but when Olin speaks of tackling classic
roles it's not only ``Camille'' that's on her mind.
   ``One of my first stage parts was in a comedy called `Able
Drugger,' an English comedy,'' Olin, dressed in jeans and a simple,
white blouse, recalled in a recent interview. ``I played a man and
I enjoyed that. I very much would like to play a man. I'd like to
do `Hamlet.'''
   Hamlet is a tragic male, incapable of making up his mind. But
Olin might be too tough as the Danish prince. Her characters -
Sabina in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and Masha in
``Enemies, A Love Story'' - are erotic cynics: intelligent,
complex, highly sexual, painfully self-aware.
   There's something otherwordly about them; they're objects of
desire yet very much alone. They make their own rules. Fair play no
longer matters; they've been hurt too often.
   Sabina is an avant-garde artist living in Czechoslovakia during
the 1968 uprising, a free spirit in an oppressed country, the
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem
pornographic. Masha, for which Olin received an Academy Award
nomination for best supporting actress, is an embittered Holocaust
survivor, a force of life but an even stronger force of death.
   In ``Havana,'' her new film, Olin plays Roberta Duran, a Swede
trapped in a ``Casablanca''-like love triangle, torn between
American playboy-gambler Robert Redford and Cuban revolutionary
Raul Julia. Roberta - or Bobbi as she's called - is somewhat softer
than Masha or Sabina. She's more passive, easier to manipulate and,
for Olin, an easier person to like.
   ``Sabina's so bored with life, so fed up with life,'' Olin said.
``And Masha's so distraught. She was hard to live with. I like to
be able to close the door to the studio, but it's very difficult
with some characters. I also felt very vulnerable when I did Bobbi.
I wanted to be good when I did Bobbi, and I kept that with me.
   ``Masha was very hard to come back to every night, to sleep with
every night. You touch areas in yourself that I don't think are
very healthy to touch.''
   Olin, 35, was born in Stockholm. Her parents were actors, her
father, Stij Olin, appearing in Ingmar Bergman's classic ``The
Seventh Seal.'' But they divorced when she was little and for all
her all spirit, she remembered herself as self-conscious and
insecure, more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside
world.
   ``I was a weird child and I still see things differently,'' she
recalled in a soft voice, smiling shyly. ``I always remember very

there are boxes and papers, and someone will say, `Excuse the boxes

was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow, a yearning to be in
touch with all sides of herself, a rebellion against the rules that
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere
role-playing.
   ``If I ever had a daughter I'd bring her up the same way,
encourage her to do what I did,'' said Olin, a single mother whose
son, August, is named after Strindberg.
   ``I think it's important for everyone to stay open, not to be
afraid, and if you push that way, I think that makes a difference
for an actor. The great thing about Marlon Brando, he's very macho
and all of that, but there's a huge woman in there as well.''

   Lena Olin was a tomboy. She didn't want to be
pretty. She cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses. She
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties.
   She changed once she turned 13 - no one who's seen ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies, A Love Story'' would
question that. But watch those films, the way she uncorks a wine
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between Olin and other
women and you'll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than
a bowler hat.
   And she hasn't stopped looking for new ways to bring that
quality into her professional life. As a Swedish actress, she's
been compared to Garbo, but when Olin speaks of tackling classic
roles it's not only ``Camille'' that's on her mind.
   ``One of my first stage parts was in a comedy called `Able
Drugger,' an English comedy,'' Olin, dressed in jeans and a simple,
white blouse, recalled in a recent interview. ``I played a man and
I enjoyed that. I very much would like to play a man. I'd like to
do `Hamlet.'''
   Hamlet is a tragic male, incapable of making up his mind. But
Olin might be too tough as the Danish prince. Her characters -
Sabina in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and Masha in
``Enemies, A Love Story'' - are erotic cynics: intelligent,
complex, highly sexual, painfully self-aware.
   There's something otherwordly about them; they're objects of
desire yet very much alone. They make their own rules. Fair play no
longer matters; they've been hurt too often.
   Sabina is an avant-garde artist living in Czechoslovakia during
the 1968 uprising, a free spirit in an oppressed country, the
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem
pornographic. Masha, for which Olin received an Academy Award
nomination for best supporting actress, is an embittered Holocaust
survivor, a force of life but an even stronger force of death.
   In ``Havana,'' her new film, Olin plays Roberta Duran, a Swede
trapped in a ``Casablanca''-like love triangle, torn between
American playboy-gambler Robert Redford and Cuban revolutionary
Raul Julia. Roberta - or Bobbi as she's called -is somewhat softer
than Masha or Sabina. She's more passive, easier to manipulate and,
for Olin, an easier person to like.
   ``Sabina's so bored with life, so fed up with life,'' Olin said.
``And Masha's so distraught. She was hard to live with. I like to
be able to close the door to the studio, but it's very difficult
with some characters. I also felt very vulnerable when I did Bobbi.
I wanted to be good when I did Bobbi, and I kept that with me.
   ``Masha was very hard to come back to every night, to sleep with
every night. You touch areas in yourself that I don't think are
very healthy to touch.''
   Olin, 35, was born in Stockholm. Her parents were actors, her
father, Stij Olin, appearing in Ingmar Bergman's classic ``The
Seventh Seal.'' But they divorced when she was little and for all
her all spirit, she remembered herself as self-conscious and
insecure, more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside
world.
   ``I was a weird child and I still see things differently,'' she
recalled in a soft voice, smiling shyly. ``I always remember very
strange things. I have a capacity to walk in an apartment where
there are boxes and papers, and someone will say, `Excuse the boxes
and papers.' And I'll say, `Oh, I didn't see that.' I think I
concentrate on other things, small things that can be revealing.''
   Acting was the perfect way to express herself, and at age 20
Olin entered the Royal Dramatic Theater School, joining Bergman's

   When it comes to Shakespeare, ``Hamlet'' is still
very much the thing.
   In recent months, Britain's two large government-subsidized
theaters have tackled the Prince of Denmark, and two other London
plays are now on using Hamlet as a central character.
   It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and Hamlet's
celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese (``si
hai shi huo''), Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'') or English
(``To be or not to be'').
   In Paris, Patrice Chereau's production recently swept the Moliere
Awards, the French equivalent of Broadway's Tony. Britain has
averaged eight major ``Hamlet'' productions every year for the past
three years. New York's Public Theater presented it in 1986 with
Kevin Kline as the prince.
   Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress
Sarah Bernhardt a century ago, Dame Judith Andersonand more recently
Diane Venora at the Public in 1982.
   Laurence Olivier called it ``the best play ever written,'' and
his 1948 film portrayal was the only Shakespeare work ever to win
Academy Awards for best film and best actor.
   Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great
18th-century actor David Garrick hated the graveyard scene. ``I
swore,'' he said, ``that I would not leave the stage 'till I had
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.''
   The Victorians left out Hamlet's lapses into vernacular, along
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect
prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot
involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole,
much-applauded play by British dramatist Tom Stoppard about two
characters who find they do not exist outside the play.
   In 1987, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed production
with his Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm had a week-long run in
Britain, and in September Russian director Yuri Lyubimov will stage
``Hamlet'' with a British company at the Leicester Haymarket Theater.
   Drawn from Scandinavian legend, ``Hamlet'' is about a prince who
comes home from university to discover that his father has been
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the
queen he has widowed.
   Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of Denmark, Hamlet
plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched
poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by
dying in a sword fight.
   At its most basic, Hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be
reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over
the ages have seen Hamlet as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist,
militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of
action.
   This troubles some actors including Jonathan Pryce, who derides
what he calls the ``Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the
play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to
everything and everyone, ``Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in
particular.
   ``Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks
Lynne Truss in The Listener magazine. ``The answer seems to be that,
on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any
interpretation seems to be valid.''
   In recent years Londoners have been treated to Roger Rees' dry,
intensely cerebral Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company; Peter
Stormare's manic, military Hamlet for Ingmar Bergman; and now Daniel
Day-Lewis' highly emotional and impetuous Hamlet at the National.
   Richard Eyre's production continues the National's tradition of
doing a ``Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's
tenure. Day-Lewis, best known for the films ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``A Room With
a View,'' has inherited a part played in 1963 by Peter O'Toole and
in 1976 by Albert Finney.
   Also on show are Iris Murdoch's ``The Black Prince,'' adapted
from her 1973 novel, and the revival of Anton Chekhov's 1887
``Ivanov,'' with Alan Bates as a penniless landowner who sees
himself as a failed Hamlet figure.
   Murdoch, 69, first encountered Hamlet as a school text when she
was 15. She ``an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of
Bradley Pearson, the sardonic tax inspector of ``The Black Prince''
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of Hamlet.
   ``I became absolutely entranced by it and by Shakespeare
generally,'' she recalled in an interview. ``He's very good on
politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.''
   From Garrick and Henry Irving through John Barrymore, Olivier and
John Gielgud to today's acting generation, Hamlet remains the hurdle
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And
they rarely agree on whether Hamlet is an easy role or a difficult
one.
   ``It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which
adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues Michael
Pennington, who played the role in 1980 at Stratford.
   But Mark Rylance, who plays ``Hamlet'' in the Royal Shakespeare
Company's current Stratford production, disagrees.
   ``I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role,
it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. ``The
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot
of people cop out of that.''
   Eyre, 46, first directed ``Hamlet'' in an acclaimed London
production in 1980, then returned to the play intrigued by its
elasticity.
   ``I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing
up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over
the novel and films, too,'' he said.
   ``It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with,
a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off,
Hamlet is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince.
   ``This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of
Realpolitik.''

   A story written by filmmaker Ingmar
Bergman about the turbulent marriage of his parents will be filmed
by Denmark's Bille August next year, the two Oscar-winning directors
announced Friday.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood system, in my nerves and in my genes,'' Bergman, 71,
told reporters.
   The filming of ``Good Intentions'' starts in the autumn of 1990,
with a world premiere in Sweden for the four-part television series
planned for Christmas 1992, officials said. A cinema version also
will be distributed.
   Bergman described his parents, Karin and Erik, as ``predestined
for catastrophy in life because of too high demands from within
themselves, toward each other and from society.''
   Bergman nursed the idea of ``Good Intentions'' during the 1982
filming of the partially biographical ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which
won four Oscars. Since then, he has retired from directing films,
though he still produces plays.
   August's international breakthrough came with ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' which won a 1989 Oscar for best foreign film. It also
won the Golden Palm award last year at the Cannes Film Festival.

   The tenors said it will be the first time they have performed
together. The proceeds will go to charity organizations.
   The trio said they would sing various songs and opera arias

   Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson are
getting together to make a scoundrels-and-scruples television movie.
   The movie, tentatively titled ``Rip,'' will be filmed in Austin
next month. It was written and will be produced by the Texas team of
Bud Shrake and writer Gary Cartwright.
   According to Shrake, ``Rip'' is about a modern Texas ranger ``who
has a high moral code and is forced to solve a crime with a
scoundrel. It's kind of like `48 Hrs.'''
   Kristofferson will play the ranger, nicknamed Rip, while Nelson
is to portray the scoundrel.
   Nelson and Kristofferson also appeared together in Shrake's 1984
film, ``Songwriter,'' and were reunited later in CBS's television
movie version of ``Stagecoach.''
   CBS has scheduled the film for broadcast in February.

Sammy Davis Jr. on his show.
   ``I'm very special. I'm gifted. I was sent here to do this,''
Hall says in the Sept. 18 issue of US magazine. ``Now that sounds
weird, but the bottom line is I sat back and laughed because I
planned this since I was 12.''
   But having your dreams fulfilled isn't all fun and games, Hall
says.
   ``I have this strange paranoia,'' said Hall. ``I guess I don't
want people to get mad at me. I feel very black and very alone, and
I don't want to ruffle the feathers of the white establishment with

   On the bright side, he did get Sammy Davis Jr. as a guest on his

   Actress Gena Rowlands donned blue jeans and

other role she has held.
   Rowlands plays a rancher-matriarch in the film ``Montana'' who is
fighting to keep her family's cattle ranch out of a coal company's
hands. While the role of Bess Guthrie is a new one for her, she said
Guthrie _ like other characters she has played _ is a strong woman.
   ``I like to play strong women,'' Rowlands said. ``I'm interested
in how women endure what they have to endure.''
   She and Richard Crenna are starring in the movie being filmed now
near Bozeman. The script was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Larry McMurtry. It movie will be shown on Ted Turner's
television network.
   Rowlands said she also took the role because she liked the script
and wanted to spend some time in Montana, which she first visited as
a teen-ager during a trip to Glacier National Park.

   Alex Valhos, a 6-year-old cancer patient, is
getting support from someone who knows what he is going through _
baseball star Dave Dravecky.
   Valhos is at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where he
will undergo an 18-day series of tests and conditioning followed by
a bone marrow transplant.
   ``Welcome to Seattle!'' the child said when he arrived at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Thursday night.
   Dravecky, the San Francisco Giants pitcher who is also a cancer
victim, helped raise some $100,000 for Alex during his own dramatic
comeback to major league baseball several weeks ago.
   A week later, Dravecky broke his arm pitching a game in Montreal.
The injury was related to surgery last year to remove a malignant
tumor from his left arm.
   More than 7,000 people have undergone preliminary tests for
compatibility with Alex, who suffers from T-cell leukemia. But it
appears his 2-year-old brother, Gregory, may be the best hope for a
bone marrow donor, although he is not a perfect match.
   The cancer research center is named for Northwest native Fred
Hutchinson, a pitcher for Detroit from 1939 to 1953 who died of
cancer in 1964.

Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman lost a court battle in Stockholm Tuesday 
for symbolic damages of one crown -- 15 cents -- from the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet, which he claimed had violated the copyright of his memoirs. 
Bergman and his publishers, Nordstedts, took the national daily to court two 
weeks ago, alleging that it had published an article based on unedited material 
from his biography "Laterna Magica" before it was published in 1987.ALEENE

   After years of TV addiction, Italians are finding
their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of
theatergoing.
   Internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in
favor of the stage, and spectators are responding by forming ticket
lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows.
   Marcello Mastroianni has tackled Russian drama. Swedish film star
Ingrid Thulin _ the sensuous woman in Ingmar Bergman's classic 1957
film ``Wild Strawberries'' _ plays a domineering mother in a tragedy
by the Spanish playwright Federico Garcia Lorca.
   Actress Monica Vitti is being peppered with offers to bring her
hilarious performance as a brash reporter in Ben Hecht's ``The Front
Page'' back to the United States.
   ``After more than a decade-long love affair with television,
Italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and
tragedy,'' says University of Rome sociology Professor Alberto
Abruzzese.
   ``They want to be moved by real-life sounds and be tickled by the
comedians they saw on the screen.''
   Last year, movie attendance in Italy dropped by 18 percent. While
movie houses have been closing throughout the country, new theaters
have opened in Naples, Florence and smaller cities to bring the
total to 1,700 nationwide.
   Thulin, one of Bergman's favorite actresses, has returned to the
stage after a 20-year absence in Lorca's ``The House of Bernarda
Alba'' which is presently on tour in Italy.
   Bergman himself will come to Italy this year to direct an Italian
version of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Mastroianni's performance in Nikita Michailov's ``Mechanical
Pianola'' produced a nightly traffic jam in Rome's central Piazza
Argentina. They play is adapted from a short story by Chekhov.
Mastroianni told interviewers he hadn't felt so thrilled since he
won an Oscar nomination for his role in ``Dark Eyes'' three years
ago.
   Comedian Ugo Tognazzi riled a few government ministers and
triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high
places during his stage version of Moliere's classic ``The Miser.''
   Italians spent $118 million on theater tickets in 1987 _ a 23
percent increase from 1986, and 1988 figures point to another 20
percent jump. During that period, the average price of an orchestra
seat increased only about 16 percent, from $18 to $21.
   Government statistics show that one out of five Italians attended
some sort of theater performance in 1988.
   Just as in Roman times the government organized theater events
for its people, today's network of 14 state-subsidized theaters,
offer stage variety that ranges from translations of Broadway hits
to Greek tragedy to Italian classics.
   Post avant-garde performances and experimental groups at 500
private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the $42
million which the Italian government annually allocates to encourage
the theater industry.
   Italy's ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics
of Greek theater _ tragedy, comedy and satire. In medieval times,
religious themes were popular.
   During the Renaissance a new form based on classic theater was
shaped by Machiavelli and others. It gave way to the commedia
dell'arte which dominated Italy and most of Europe until the end of
the 1700s.
   Luigi Pirandello, master of Italy's 20th-century theater, focused
on the condition of the modern man.
   While the classics are still popular, they have competition from
Broadway-style productions.
   Vitti, who starred in an all-woman version of Neil Simon's ``Odd
Couple'' last year, has been touring Italy in ``Front Page.''
   ``The success has been incredible,'' she said. ``Spectators have
stood on line all night in Turin and Lucca. Police have had to
intervene to stop punchups over tickets, and we're still going
strong after four months on tour.''
   Vitti has received offers to bring the show to New York, Los
Angeles and Buenos Aires, but her fear of flying makes her hesitate.
   A scuffle erupted New Year's Eve in Milan over the presentation
of ``Trojan Women'' in ancient Greek. Fifty spectators fought over
the remaining four tickets on sale at a theater.
   Other serious dramas, including works by Shakespeare and
Pirandello, are playing to sold-out crowds. Andrea Jonasson, the
Swedish wife of Italy's best-known theater director Giorgio
Strehler, alternated lines in Italian and German in Pirandello's
Berlin-based drama on lost identity, ``As You Desire Me.''

At the Newport Theatre Arts Center, "A Little Night Music" has a pretty face: 
Gil Morales' sets are airy and romantic, and Dan McWest's costumes, fetching 
but not overly bright, complement the environment nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The acting too was colorful at Saturday night's performance. But the cast, 
directed by D. Jay Bradley, often struggled with Stephen Sondheim's score, a 
relatively challenging collection of songs in three-quarter time. 
</P>
<P>
"A Little Night Music," inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film "Smiles of a Summer 
Night," offers a humorous take on love and lust. 
</P>
<P>
Just about all its characters have to grapple with annoying libidos while 
attempting to nurture feelings of a more "pure" nature. 
</P>
<P>
Everything comes to a head during a weekend in the country. Middle-aged 
Fredrick (Jim Rule) is married to lovely, naive Anne (CeCe Moore) but longs for 
the experienced Desiree (Mary Tuck), an old flame. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken the vainglorious Count Malcolm (Jeff Paul) as a lover. He, in 
turn, has a witty, vindictive wife (scene-swiping Diane Botnick). 
</P>
<P>
As Fredrick, Rule may not look like much of a romantic figure, but he does lend 
the role a weary dignity that is close to heroic, and he brings a decent 
singing voice to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck's Desiree is appropriately vivacious and her handling of "Send in the 
Clowns," while not the showstopper it can be, is gently felt. 
</P>
<P>
Paul scores points with his pompous portrayal, while Botnick gives the show its 
giddiest moments. 
</P>
<P>
'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC'

   The nation's leading theater
re-opened, thanks to a $1.5 million donation from the Swedish
government, with a performance by a Swedish troupe directed by the
daughter of filmmaker Ingmar Bergman.
   The Ruben Dario Theater, named for the country's most famous poet
and inaugurated in 1969, had been closed for two years because of
problems with its sound and air-conditioning systems.
   Admision was free to Sunday's opening night show, which featured
the collective Backa Theater, directed by Eva Bergman. In addition
to the theater group, the program included a concert of Scandinavian
music.
   The evening's program was part of Swedish-Nicaraguan Cultural
Week, in which Scandanavian artists have been performing in
provincial cities and the capital.
   The audience Sunday included Vice President Sergio Ramirez and
Interior Minister Tomas Borge.

The whimsical and poignant 1985 Back to the Future (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.) finds 
small-town youth Michael J. Fox accidentally sent back in time 30 years, where, 
to his chagrin, he discovers his mother is crazy about him rather than his own 
father. 
</P>
<P>
The Witches of Eastwick (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) was a popular success even 
though it turned the John Updike novel upside down and inside out. Jack 
Nicholson is a joy as a devil of a fellow who materializes in a staid New 
England community in which three single women (Cher, Susan Sarandon and 
Michelle Pfeiffer) pine for some male company. 
</P>
<P>
Call Me (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is an ambitious but flawed 1988 
lady-in-distress thriller about a young Manhattan photographer/reporter 
(Patricia Charbonneau), plagued by both an obscene phone caller and a drug 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Newton-John makes her dramatic debut on TV in the contemporary fairy 
tale A Mom for Christmas (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
In Leo McCarey's durably sentimental The Bells of St. Mary's (Channel 11 
Tuesday at8 p.m.), an authentic Yuletide treat, priest Bing Crosby skirmishes 
with Ingrid Bergman's doughty mother superior, who is determined to build a new 
parish school. Warning: It's been colorized. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Fletch Lives (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is the ultimate comedy of 
condescension, a movie with a hero whose every other line of dialogue is a 
snide wisecrack, directed at a fool. Starring Chevy Chase, who created Fletch 
in the 1985 movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from personal experience, writer Bo Goldman contributed a script to the 
1982 Shoot the Moon (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) that made it one of the 
year's best, an exceedingly painful and persuasive account of the breakup of a 
marriage. Directed by Alan Parker and starring Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1982 Diner (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.), Barry Levinson rescues our 
memories of the late '50s and early '60s from the high gloss that TV has put on 
those years and lets them stand tender and real. The film's title comes from a 
Baltimore hangout where recent high school grads Steve Guttenberg, Mickey 
Rourke, Kevin Bacon and Daniel Stern are beginning to feel an edge of 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas in Connecticut (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a warm wartime 
romantic comedy that holds up quite well. Barbara Stanwyck plays a newspaper 
cooking columnist who takes a soldier (Dennis Morgan) home for Christmas dinner 
on orders of her boss (Charles Coburn) -- the only hitch is that she can't 
cook. 
</P>
<P>
Fanny and Alexander (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.), Ingmar Bergman's great 
1983 farewell to the screen, may begin at a glorious Christmas gathering, but 
this turn-of-the-century test-of-the-spirit saga centers on two children, a 
brother and sister, whose happy existence is swiftly terminated when their 
widowed mother re-marries.

<HEAD>Luck Combines With Hard Work for Prize-Winning Danish Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES FERRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bille August claims he is not
superstitious. But the Danish director admits that while filming the
award-winning ``Pelle the Conquerer'' he was persecuted by good luck.
   During six months of shooting, storms appeared on cue and
freakish weather added just the right touch of ice to the Baltic Sea
for a critical scene.
   ``Pelle'' is up for an Oscar as best foreign film, and Swedish
star Max von Sydow is nominated for best actor in the 61st annual
Academy Awards, to be announced March 29.
   Though the movie captured the Golden Palm at Cannes for best film
and won an American Golden Globe, August is ambivalent about such
honors.
   ``I respect the value of awards, but it feels odd to be competing
with other filmmakers. I'd rather just be a colleague,' he said.
   Before the Oscar nominations, August generated Hollywood's
interest with last year's ``Twist and Shout,'' a film about Danish
teen-agers in the 1960s. Offers for new pictures came in, but he
said he didn't care for the manuscripts or the conditions.
   Then he read ``The House of the Spirits,'' by Isabel Allende, a
San Francisco-based author. The book traces 70 years of history in
her native Chile.
   Other studios were chasing Allende to sell the movie rights but
she held them off, unconvinced that her story of hatred, fears and
loves could be transformed into a movie.
   August said he practically forced her to watch ``Pelle,'' which
he had just put in the can.
   ``She was reserved after the screening and would make no
decision, so I took my film and went home, disappointed,'' he said
in an interview. The next day Allende called him and said he was the
only director she wanted to film her book. The Warner Bros. project
will be filmed in Argentina in English.
   ``It is very exciting for me,'' August said. ``American studios
have the capacity for larger projects and nearly an endless pool of
good screen actors, whereas in Scandinavia the number of good screen
actors is limited.
   ``In the United States there are good technicians, economic
resources and distribution is unbelievably effective.''
   August never looks beyond his current project. ``I am monogamous
to the project I'm working on and don't flirt with future ideas,''
he said. ``Now I am being true to `The House of the Spirits.'''
   Good fortune seemed to pursue the shooting of ``Pelle the
Conquerer,'' Martin Andersen Nexoe's 1906 novel about Swedish
immigrants in Denmark, shot on the Baltic island of Bornholm.
   When a 60-year-old fisherman heard that the opening scene _ ships
sailing through dense fog _ was scheduled for Oct. 8, his birthday,
he reassured the director that as far back as he could recall there
had always been a storm on that date. As if on order, the storm that
hit Bornholm that day was preceeded by thick fog.
   Three days before the crew was to film Pelle escaping from his
tormentors by hopping across a cluster of ice floes, the Baltic was
totally free of ice. Temperatures suddenly plunged and froze the sea
into solid ice. Then an on-shore wind the evening before shooting
activated a warm current that created the perfect floes on which the
boy made his escape.
   August says the harder you work, the luckier you get. ``It is the
director's job to anticipate problems with the crew, weather, to
figure out how actors will react on that day,'' he said. ``Only when
every detail is in place can you begin to experiment.''
   The title role was played by Pelle Hvenegaard, who was chosen
from among 3,000 boys. Although he is Danish, his lines at the start
of the movie are in a southern Swedish dialect which he learned from
a tutor.
   Non-Scandinavian audiences will miss the transition from Swedish
to Danish, but August believes it doesn't matter. ``Pelle has
universal, international qualities, emotions that can be understood
by all,'' he said.
   ``But I think it's a mistake to make `international films,' to
polish them down until they are neutered. A film needs identity. The
best I've seen have this element,'' he said.
   Working with von Sydow, a veteran of 40 foreign films who played
in some of Ingmar Bergman's best pictures, was one of the greatest
experiences of his directing career, August said.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Quirks of fate supplement the prize line-up - Cannes
Film Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At my prep school they used to show a feature film on the last night of
term. No matter what it was - Citizen Kane or Carry On Up The Khyber - the
same air of punch-drunk euphoria reigned. The assembled schoolboys knew that
their bags were packed and that there were 12 hours to freedom.
It was the same at the end of the 45th Cannes Film Festival. We had written
our final exam papers and attended every competition sitting; soon we would
hear about the prizes. Now all we had to do was to watch Tom Cruise in the
non-competitive closing movie Far And Away. This exuberant load of tosh, the
first film shot in 65-millimetre since Ryan's Daughter, has Cruise as a
young Irish peasant who streetfights his way from Connemara to Oklahoma, via
Boston, in the 1890s while falling in love with Nicole Kidman (aka Cruise's
offscreen girlfriend).
The Cannes audience loved the film. They cheered when Cruise first kisses
Kidman in front of a snow-patterned window with tinkly Christmas harp music
from John (ET) Williams. They cheered the climactic Oklahoma land race and
ensuing punch-up between hero and villain for Miss Kidman's hand. Most of
all they cheered the fact that Cannes had nothing left to throw at them. Now
more than ever was it rich to leave.
The final days brought some piquant addenda, but they were provided less by
Hollywood than by North America's shoestring divisions. The expected
mega-treats disappointed. David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a
catchpenny prequel to the TV series; Sidney Lumet's A Stranger Among Us is a
daft cop thriller with Melanie Griffith going undercover among New York's
Hasidic Jews, and Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is a Steinbeck adaptation
notable only for John Malkovich's touching Lenny.
I enjoyed far more two lesser-budget films drawn from their makers' own
lives. In the Directors Fortnight actor John Turturro presented his
writing-directing debut Mac. This low-budget tale of a self-made
Italian-American housebuilder (Turturro) and his battle for honest values in
a corrupt world is a touch loudhailed: like an Arthur Miller script directed
by Federico Fellini. But at best it is also powerfully funny, with Turturro
a marvel in the lead role based on his own father.
From Canada came Jean-Claude Lauzon's Leolo. The 12-year-old hero is the
film-maker himself, growing up in a ramshackle family flat in 1960s Montreal
where puberty, poverty and an army of potty relatives surge around him.
Especially eye-catching are Grandpa, who is dispatched to a mental asylum
during the brief intervals when Leolo is not trying to kill him, and
musclebound Big Brother who trains himself to look like A. Schwarzenegger
but still gets sand kicked in his face by any passer-by. Like Mac the film
is loud, episodic and all' Italiana. It is also witty, infectious and
winningly candid about sexual self-discovery.
The last days of Cannes are devoted in part to catching up with missed films
that colleagues tell you are masterpieces. This is never a gratifying
pastime. Either the colleague is right, in which case you are late with the
scoop. Or the colleague is wrong, in which case you want to brain him.
Braining has been a la mode at Cannes in 1992. Top of the films I could have
spent my life without seeing is Victor Erice's The Sun In The Quince Tree,
even though it shared the Prix du Jury and won the International Critics
Prize. This 2 1/2 -hour Spanish docudrama about a painter painting, yes, a
sunlit quince tree manages the remarkable feat of seeming both artless and
pretentious. In a grainy mixture of film and video, it drones on trying to
achieve its quasi-religious minimalism. But we never feel cinematically the
sensual magic of the artistic process, proclaimed in words by the real-life
painter Antonio Lopez. Nor do we know why there are so many extracurricular
shots of railway lines or TV sets glowing in night apartments or Mrs Lopez
pottering around the house.
So we come to the 45th Cannes Film Festival prizes. Jury president Gerard
Depardieu walked onto the stage, with that hunched-shouldered rolling gait
we know from a hundred French movies, like a bear searching for honey. And
soon we knew which honey-pot he was going for. The Palme d'Or winner was
Bille August's Best Intentions, praised on this page last week and cheered
again at Cannes last night. The majestic Ingmar Bergman-scripted period
epic, based on the lives of Ingmar's own parents, also won Best Actress for
Pernilla August, the director's wife, who played Bergman's mother.
If you can cope with that dynastic tangle, how about the evening's other
coincidences and convolutions? America's The Player, as well as winning Best
Director for Robert Altman, won Best Actor for Tim Robbins, seen here most
recently squiring his first film as director - the amiable political satire
Bob Roberts - through the festival. And John Turturro, last year's Cannes
Best Actor for Barton Fink, also brought his directing debut to Cannes, the
aforementioned Mac, and ran off with the prestigious Camera d'Or award for
Best First Feature.
One other Cannes quirk of fate. Bille August was the first non-American to
win the Palme d'Or for four years. The last non-American to win the prize
was - Bille August. That was for Pelle The Conqueror in 1988. What a tangled
web the film festival world weaves. This writer is now awarding himself a
personal Palme d'Or for getting through it all - the confusions,
coincidences and critical rigours - and is departing into well-fed anonymity
in central France.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WOODY WOOING A NEW MUSE WITH 'CRIMES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tombstone-style ad Woody Allen has decreed for his new film "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" is startling in its lack of startle. No pulsating quotes, no 
searing ad line, no pretty faces, no drawn gun, no bared bosom; just the title 
in large letters adrift in a sea of white space, with the cast and crew in much 
smaller type and Allen's name nestled inconspicuously among the other players. 
</P>
<P>
A drawn gun and several bared bosoms are implicit although not revealed in the 
film's contents, and ad lines of incendiary power would be possible ("When Love 
Dies . . . The Hard Way," and so on). 
</P>
<P>
The ad may (or may not) be a distributor's nightmare. Despite his critical 
reputation, Allen has never been a consistently big box-office attraction. The 
ad can also be variously interpreted as one man's modesty and his earnest 
rebellion against customary hype, or it can be viewed as a kind of inverted 
arrogance that says Allen's work does not require the hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the ad will probably work as well as and conceivably better 
than another kind of ad would have. Word of mouth sells or kills most films, 
and Allen has a hard-core following which amplifies word of mouth when Allen is 
on form. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact is that "Crimes and Misdemeanors" reaffirms Allen's status as the 
most persistently personal, original and provocative of all U.S. film makers. 
It is one of his best films.

As has been said about Ken Russell and a few other obstreperously 
individualistic creators, Allen's less successful films are more interesting 
than most directors' smooth triumphs. "Interiors," "September" and "Another 
Woman" may have fizzled at the box office, but in their examination of 
characters and relationships and in their capturing of moods and environments 
they can't accurately be called failures. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors," as Michael Wilmington pointed out in an eloquent 
review last week, Allen has done what many of his fainter-hearted admirers have 
beseeched him to do, which is leaven the serious stuff with a few good jokes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sizable cargo of laughs in "Crimes and Misdemeanors," some of them 
Allen's sardonic one-liners as a failed documentary-maker, scorned husband and 
rejected lover. More of them derive from the character Allen created for Alan 
Alda to play (dazzlingly well) as a lecherous, overbearing, egocentric producer 
of television comedy. Alda will call to mind, at least in the industry, all or 
part of several real life models. 
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy about the humor, which leavens the whole piece, is that it 
exists within Allen's darkest film yet. 
</P>
<P>
His pessimism has seemed real enough in several of the films. The characters he 
has played have often as not lost the girl. Like Chaplin's Tramp, the 
collective Woody has gone on alone, with a wry joke instead of a strut. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointments Allen rendered on Mia Farrow in "Purple Rose of Cairo," 
masked only slightly by his technically ingenious homage to the movies as our 
principal source of solace, were bitterly cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's pessimism lifted measurably in "Hannah and Her Sisters," which glowed 
with an uncommon family warmth. Yet much of the warmth began, or flowed from, 
an acceptance of the world as it is and a setting-aside of the infidelities, 
the estrangements, the disappointments and betrayals of the past. Ripeness, and 
forgiveness, were all. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors" -- the echoing parallel to the Ingmar Bergman 
title "Cries and Whispers" is intriguingly close -- Allen seems to take the 
idea of ripeness, of a philosophical acceptance of reality, even further than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The film maker Allen plays is making a documentary on a German-Jewish 
philosopher. With his thick accent, the philosopher can be taken as a parody of 
an academic type. He is also a comment on the film maker's unworldliness. On 
the evidence, PBS would be hesitant to show the documentary at midnight, even 
if they could get it for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But the philosopher is saying desperately coherent things, depicting the 
universe as cold, indifferent and mechanistic, warmed only by such efforts as 
human beings make to create warmth within it. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary is left unfinished because the philosopher has evidently found 
the efforts to warm the universe unavailing. The documentary sequence is played 
off against Allen's growing infatuation with the production assistant played by 
Mia Farrow. It is not unlike a magician's use of indirection, making you 
realize only later what was really going on. 
</P>
<P>
As reviews have noted, "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is the most melodramatic of 
Allen's films: Martin Landau, in another superb performance, conspiring with 
his brother Jerry Ohrbach in the murder of a discarded mistress who is making 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In this movie Allen is wrestling with a lot of major stuff, love and the death 
of love, guilt and punishment (if any), and, embracing all else, the question 
of the existence and nature of God. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to think of another film maker who could give us a Seder table 
argument about an all-seeing God (insisted upon by Allen's devout father) 
against a cynical worldly pragmatism voiced by an atheistic aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Ingmar Bergman has often dealt with faith and the death of faith, the pains of 
spiritual aridity, but never a laugh in a carload, though affecting in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's film is first and last an entertainment with all the appurtenances 
thereof -- humor, suspense, drama, conflict. It also offers reverberations that 
won't die down, and speculations about living in a world with and without the 
consoling, chiding idea of God. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has come a long way from humor for its own sake to humor as the carrier 
of some very somber thoughts.

<HEAD>Diverse Collection of Nominees for Oscar's Best Actor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boy who turns into a man. An autistic
genius. A Swedish peasant. A hard-bitten FBI agent. A dedicated math
teacher.
   Has there ever seem such a diverse collection of nominees for
best actor? Each performance seems unique, creating a difficult
choice for Academy voters.
   Gene Hackman has been in Oscar contention before. He was
nominated for supporting performances in ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967)
and ``I Never Sang for My Father'' (1970), and won the big prize as
the relentless Popeye Doyle in ``The French Connection'' (1971).
   Hackman, 58, is one of those actors who seems to get better with
age. He gets kidded about his lack of selectivity _ last year he
appeared in five films within three months _ but invariably he draws
praise from critics and his fellow actors. His one memorable film of
1988 was ``Mississippi Burning,'' for which he was nominated.
   As the Southern sheriff turned FBI agent, Hackman once more
brought depth to what could have been a surface role. ``I always
manage to find a way in films to be a bit introspective,'' he said
in a recent magazine interview. ``It helps me as an actor, makes me
feel as if I'm doing something important.''
   Max Von Sydow's nomination as the downtrodden farmhand in ``Pelle
the Conqueror'' was a rarity: He won the recognition speaking a
foreign language. Only one Oscar has ever been awarded to a
performer in a subtitled film: Sophia Loren for ``Two Women.''
   Although he has been acclaimed as a star of Ingmar Bergman films
and international movies, Von Sydow, 66, has had no Academy
recognition until now.
   ``I am not American and I am not English,'' he says, ``so my
choice of parts in English-language films is limited.''
   Von Sydow was delighted with his ``Pelle'' role because it
allowed him to use his own childhood dialect; like the character
Lasse, he grew up in a small Swedish town. He liked the role because
it offered ``such a great variety of emotion. In every new scene
there is a new situation and a new attitude from the man.''
   Although Robin Williams had a breakthrough nomination last year
with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' comedy has traditionally been held
in low regard by Academy voters. Now Tom Hanks is trying to break
that tradition as a nominee for ``Big.'' He made a comedic gem out
of the role of 13-year-old Josh Baskin who overnight is granted his
wish to become a grownup.
   For Hanks, 32-year-old graduate of sitcom (``Bosom Buddy''), the
role required no method-actor searching for identity. ``I just
imagined what it would be like to be a 13-year-old,'' he says simply.
   ``The kid is on the immature side,'' Hanks adds, ``and I must say
I was much the same when I was his age. It wasn't until I was 14
that I started growing up and becoming highly intelligent and
debonair.''
   Two of the other nominees for best actor faced more difficult
transformations. Edward James Olmos, the slim, laconic Lt. Martin
Castillo of TV's ``Miami Vice,'' shaved his mustache, thinned his
hair and added 40 pounds to portray East Los Angeles teacher Jaime
Escalante in ``Stand and Deliver.'' The Bolivia-born Escalante
attracted wide attention by inspiring his students to such high
academic achievements that they were suspected of cheating.
   ``What motivates Escalante is the sheer love of teaching,''
observes Olmos, 42. ``When he see the light in a student's eyes,
it's a natural high, like adrenalin. He needs it, like a performer
who needs applause.''
   Olmos himself has been attracting applause since his appearance
as the macho narrator of Luis Valdez' play and the 1971 movie,
``Zoot Suit.'' His role as Lt. Castillo won him the Emmy.
   Dustin Hoffman exerted his customary thoroughness in preparing
for his role as Raymond Babbit, the autistic man with a genius for
numbers in ``Rain Man.'' After reading the initial script, he
puzzled over the paradox of a man whose autism crippled him for
normal living, but who nevertheless could perform superhuman feats
of calculation.
   For a year, Hoffman visited with autistic savants and their
families and talked with medical experts about the phenomenon. Out
of his research came the portrayal of a man who seemingly could not
converse with anyone, yet was capable of surprising flashes of
wisdom.
   Hoffman, 51, had plenty of time to prepare as ``Rain Man''
underwent changes of directors and scripts. In the first days under
director Barry Levinson, the actor remained unsatisfied. But the
pair finally reached agreement.
   ``It's like in baseball,'' he says, ``you hit a home run and then
you start popping up. What you're trying to do is just connect, meet
the ball. In the movies, you're trying to make contact. But not
until it's over do you find out where it went.''

   The presidential campaign is over, but the spat
over the ``L'' word continues between composer-conductor Leonard
Bernstein and conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr.
   The tiff began when Bernstein, in an Oct. 30 opinion essay in The
New York Times, decried efforts to besmirch the word ``liberalism.''
   Buckley retaliated in a Nov. 2 column that recalled a meeting
Bernstein held at his New York apartment in 1970, at which leaders
of the Black Panthers chatted with the cultural elite. That
get-together was lampooned in Tom Wolfe's book ``Radical Chic, or
Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.''
   ``Lenny does not realize that one of the reasons the `L' word is
discredited is that it was handled by such as Leonard Bernstein,''
Buckley wrote.
   In the latest exchange between the two, Bernstein wrote an open
letter to the columnist that ran in Wednesday's Daily News, which
syndicates Buckley. ``Your column,'' Bernstein told Buckley, ``is
beneath your dignity.''
   ``Liberal is a word soiled by the greedy, reactionary,
back-looking impulse toward tyranny,'' Bernstein said.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell didn't figure to be
picking up a tab for Larry Flynt. But that's what a judge has
ordered him to do in the latest rebuff of his lawsuit against the
Hustler magazine publisher.
   First, the Lynchburg evangelist failed to prove he had been
libeled by a Hustler ad parody that portrayed him as an incestuous
drunkard; then, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a $200,000 award
he received for ``intentional emotional distress.''
   Now, in a closed court session last week, U.S. District Judge
James Turk ruled that Falwell must pay $20,258.55 in costs assessed
from the lawsuit.
   Turk said Falwell waited too long to object to the costs assessed
for witness fees and deposition and trial transcripts, which include
Flynt's. Turk also said in the ruling, filed Monday, that even if
Falwell had filed his objection on time it would have had no merit.

   Everyone may be equal under the law, but it
doesn't hurt if you're the son of a famous actress who was once
married to a U.S. Senator. Ask actor Michael Wilding.
   President Reagan on Wednesday signed a bill to grant Wilding a
resident visa despite a drug conviction 14 years ago in Wales. The
bill was sponsored by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who said he came to
know and respect Wilding when he was married to the actor's mother,
actress Elizabeth Taylor.
   The bill would exempt Wilding, the 34-year-old son of Miss Taylor
and the late British actor also named Michael Wilding, from a law
prohibiting people with drug violations from being granted residence
status.
   Wilding lives in New York City and is in the cast of the
television soap opera ``The Guiding Light.'' He was convicted in
Wales in 1974, three years after renouncing his U.S. citizenship, of
possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana plants.

   Exiled Soviet psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin,
who accused the government of sending sane people to mental
institutions, has received the Humanization of Medicine prize for
his work for patients' rights.
   The winner of the award, a gold plaque and $20,000, is selected
every two years by Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
   Koryagin, who now lives in a suburb of Zurich, received the award
Wednesday during a conference at the Vatican on the ``Longevity and
Quality of Life.''
   The award citation said Koryagin was honored because of his
struggle ``against bureaucratic indifference and the enslavement of
psychiatry for political purposes.'' It also noted his ``tireless
support for the physical and mental well being of his patients, who
were often treated inhumanly.''
   Koryagin was sent to a labor camp in 1981 after accusing
authorities of sending sane people to mental institutions. He
arrived in Switzerland in April 1987, two months after he was
released from prison.

Over in Stockholm, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman is suing a tabloid for 
symbolic damages of one crown (15 cents), saying it broke the copyright to his 
memoirs. The film director and his publishers took the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet to court this week, charging that it published an article based on 
unedited material from his biography, "Laterna Magica," before it was published 
in 1987. Aftonbladet's editor, Thorbjorn Larsson, denied the charge, saying the 
article was based on interviews, books and television programs.ALEENE MacMINN

   The most delectable movie of the holiday season
is a simple little confection from John Hughes about a 10-year-old
who's left behind by accident when his parents and multitude of
siblings head off for a Christmas vacation in Paris.
   ``Home Alone'' is endearing, engaging and a lot of fun, once you
suspend disbelief and buy into Hughes' idiotic premise. And one
main reason for the film's success is Macaulay Culkin, the talented
young actor who plays Kevin, the boy who finds paradise in being at
home by himself and who gets to defend the castle against all
intruders.
   Child-centered movies are popular with the younger set because
they appeal to a sense of adventure, wonderment and just plain
getting away from grown-ups. They also find an audience in those
adults who are still fortunate enough to have a streak of whimsy in
their lives.
   Some young actors put in such grand performances that the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored them with Oscar
nominations. Only one, Tatum O'Neal ever won, as supporting actress
in ``Paper Moon'' in 1973. She was 10.
   Nominees have included: Jackie Cooper, actor (``Skippy''), 1931;
Jodie Foster, supporting actress (``Taxi Driver''), 1976; Quinn
Cummings, supporting actress (``Goodbye Girl''), 1977; Justin
Henry, supporting actor (``Kramer vs. Kramer''), 1979.
   Many child-centered movies have made it to video. Here's an
alphabetical list of some of what's available:
   - ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' (1938): Good Mark Twain fun.
   - ``The Bad News Bears'' (1976): A bunch of foul-mouthed Little
Leaguers. The best of the series. The sequels are bad news.
   - ``The Bicycle Thief'' (1949): Classic Italian drama about a
man whose livelihood is threatened when a thief steals his bicycle,
and the relationship he has with his son.
   - ``Black Beauty'' (1946): A little girl searches for her black
colt. Will definitely bring a tear or two.
   - ``The Black Stallion'' (1979): Wonderful movie treatment of
children's story about boy stranded on an island with a wild, black
horse.
   - ``Bugsy Malone'' (1976): Look Ma, no grown-ups. Entire cast of
kids, starring Jodie Foster, in 1920s send-up.
   - ``Captains Courageous'' (1937): A spoiled rich kid learns
about friendship and life. Stars Spencer Tracey, Lionel Barrymore
and Freddie Bartholomew.
   - ``A Christmas Story'' (1983): Jean Shepard's marvelous memory
of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red
Ryder air rifle.
   - ``Cinema Paradiso'' (1989): Oscar winner for best foreign
film. Concerns the friendship between a little boy and a film
projectionist in a small Italian city.
   - ``David Copperfield'' (1935): Find a children's movie in the
1930s and you find Freddie Bartholomew. He's a marvel in this grand
adaptation of Dickens' grand novel. All-star cast includes W.C.
Fields, Edna May Oliver and Basil Rathbone.
   - ``Empire of the Sun'' (1987): A Steven Spielberg epic that
loses its poignancy to Spielberg glitz. Based on J.G. Ballard's
autobiographical tale of his boyhood experience in a Japanese
prison camp during World War II.
   - ``E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial'' (1982): Another Spielberg
yarn. This time, a young boy takes an alien under his wing.
   - ``Fanny and Alexander'' (1983): The adventures of two children
in Sweden at the turn of the century. Ingmar Bergman at his best.
   - ``The Fallen Idol'' (1948): A young boy becomes disillusioned
with the family butler (Ralph Richardson).
   - ``The 400 Blows'' (1959): Francois Truffaut's powerful and sad
story of a boy's glimpse of reality.
   - ``The Goonies'' (1985): Some soon-to-be-evicted kids search
for hidden teasure and get a spooky adventure in the process.
   - ``Great Expectations'' (1946): An excellent film version of
the Dicken classic about an orphan and his mysterious benefactor.
Stars John Mills, Alec Guinness and Valerie Hobson.
   - ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989): What happens when
Murphy's Law meets Daddy the Inventor. Great family fun.
   - ``Hope and Glory'' (1987): Filmmaker John Boorman's childhood
experiences in London during the blitz.
   - ``The Journey of Natty Gann'' (1985): A street kid rides the
rails.
   - ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979): Robert Benton's Oscar-winning
movie about child custody.
   - ``Mary Poppins'' (1964):
``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'' And don't forget the
dancing penguins.
   - ``Miracle on 34th Street'' (1947): Do you believe in Santa
Claus? A delightful tale, starring Natalie Wood.
   - ``My Life as a Dog'' (1987): A charming import from Sweden
about a boy's first love.
   - ``National Velvet'' (1944): Elizabeth Taylor, young and
innocent, quiet, pretty and intense. With Mickey Rooney and a fine
horse.
   - ``Paper Moon'' (1973): A con man and his con kid in a
delightful story, starring Tatum O'Neal and Ryan O'Neal.
   - ``Pelle the Conquereor'' (1988): Hard times in Denmark,
starring Max von Sydow and Pelle Hvenegaard.
   - ``Poltergeist'' (1982): What happens when your little girl
watches too much television.
   - ``The Prince and the Pauper'' (1937): Mark Twain's classic
about mistaken identity. Stars Billy and Bobby Mauch as young
prince of England and a street urchin, and Errol Flynn. Remake in
1978 stars Charlton Heston, George C. Scott and Mark Lester. Both
are worthy.
   - ``Prancer'' (1989): A little girl believes she has discovered
one of Santa's reindeer and fights to protect it.
   - ``The Red Balloon'' (1966): Only 34 minutes of film, but an
engaging and warm parable.
   - ``Salaam Bombay'' (1988): Powerful glimpse of street children
in India.
   - ``Savannah Smiles'' (1982): A 6-year-old runaway teaches a few
hoods a thing or two.
   - ``Sounder'' (1972): A sharecropper and his family. Poignant
and well acted by Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield and Kevin Hooks.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``Tom Brown's School Days'' (1950): Life at a boy's school in
Victorian England.
   - ``Treasure Island'' (1934, 1950, 1990): All three versions of
Robert Louis Stevenson's story about a boy's experience with
pirates have merit and good casts. Take your pick among Jackie
Cooper, Bobby Driscoll and Christian Bale as the kid.
   - ``Uncle Buck'' (1989): U.B. is in a class all his own. So are
the antics of his neices and nephew. Great fun from John Hughes,
starring John Candy.
   - ``Whistle Down the Wind'' (1961): Three children find a
murderer and think he's Jesus Christ. A lovely look at innocence
and trust.
   - ``Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971): What
happens to bad, selfish brats and one nice little kid when they all
visit a candy baron's factory.
   - ``Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Judy and Co. What more can we say?
Oh, yeah - and Toto, too.
   - ``The World of Henry Orient'' (1964): Peter Sellers as
lecherous pianist idolized by two adolescent girls.
   - ``The Yearling'' (1946): A boy and his fawn.
   - ``Young Sherlock Holmes'' (1985): Spielberg ran out of tricks
for this one. Somewhat disappointing, but engaging performances by
Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox as Holmes and Watson as youngsters.

<HEAD>Same Film Cancellation Theory Doesn't Always Work</HEAD>

   When two actors in the same movie are
nominated for Academy Awards, the common belief is that they will
cancel each other out.
   But it doesn't always happen. Sometimes, one wins.
   F. Murray Abraham won as best actor for ``Amadeus'' in 1984,
although Tom Hulce was nominated for the same film.
   In recent years, there have been other winners and losers for
the same movie: Shirley MacLaine (Debra Winger) _ best actress,
``Terms of Endearment,'' 1983; Jessica Lange (Teri Garr) _
supporting actress, ``Tootsie,'' 1982; Timothy Hutton (Judd Hirsch)
_ supporting actor, ``Ordinary People,'' 1980; Meryl Streep (Jane
Alexander) _ supporting actress, ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' 1979; Peter
Finch (William Holden) _ actor, ``Network,'' 1976.
   The phenomenon will be tested again this year. Lena Olin and
Anjelica Huston are both nominated for supporting actress for their
roles in ``Enemies, a Love Story.''
   The two actresses offer an interesting contrast, one a member of
an American acting dynasty, the other a product of the European
theater. Huston made history in 1986, when she became a
third-generation Oscar winner as supporting actress in ``Prizzi's
Honor.'' She had been directed by her father, John Huston, himself
an Academy Award winner as writer-director of ``The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre'' in 1948. His father, Walter, was named best
supporting actor for the same film.
   In ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' Huston plays an Auschwitz survivor
who comes to New York to confront her husband, Ron Silver. She has
described her character as ``magnificent, extremely intelligent and
honest, compassionate and yet not self-sacrificing. I loved being
able to make that statement.''
   ``She's after the truth all the time, she can't compromise, and
that's what I like about her,'' comments Lena Olin about her role.
She is another of the three wives of Silver in the Paul Mazursky
film.
   Olin was born in Stockholm and became a protegee of Ingmar
Bergman, for whom she acted in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.'' She first drew attention from American audiences
as the free-living photographer in ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being.''
   Like Huston, Dianne Wiest is an Oscar winner; hers came two
years ago as supporting actress for her role in ``Hannah and Her
Sisters.'' She has been a member of the Woody Allen stock company,
having also appeared in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' ``Radio
Days'' and ``September.'' Her second nomination comes for her
anguished single mother in ``Parenthood.''
   An Army brat, Wiest lived all over the world and began acting at
the University of Maryland. She spent four years at Washington's
Arena Stage Theater, then appeared in many New York plays,
including ``Othello'' as James Earl Jones' Desdemona.
   Julia Roberts is the youngest of the supporting actress
nominees. The doomed daughter of Sally Field in ``Steel
Magnolias,'' she was the only performer in the all-star cast to be
recognized by the Academy. Born in Smyrna, Ga., she studied acting
in New York and first drew attention in movies as a waitress in
``Mystic Pizza.''
   Brenda Fricker joined the nominees for her role as the steadfast
mother of cerebral palsy victim Daniel Day-Lewis in ``My Left
Foot.'' Previously unknown to American audiences, she is well known
as an actress in the London theater and the popular BBC series,
``Casualty.''
   Fricker was born and educated in Dublin, where ``My Left Foot''
takes place. She worked for the Irish Times newspaper before
turning to acting.

   The lights go out in St. Bartholomew's Church on Park
Avenue. Instead of the rector mounting the pulpit, however,
blaring kettle drums puncture the silence. Suddenly, on a
stage set up in front of the altar, men in camouflage
fatigues appear and begin blasting away with automatic
weapons. It is the start of Stephen Rayne's unconventional
but intensely vibrant production of "Macbeth." Set in
modern-day Africa and by a group of black actors from the
Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes in Britain, the
production was part of the recently concluded New York
International Festival of the Arts.
   Two years ago Martin Segal, a New York cultural mover and
shaker, put together the first International Festival. It was
a mammoth undertaking, perhaps too mammoth. The second
festival was leaner and, judging from the eight theater
events I saw from Europe, Asia and the U.S., it was
infinitely better.

   Consider the two pieces by the Polish avant-garde giant
Tadeusz Kantor, presented by his company, Cricot 2, at the
LaMama Theater. Kantor died in December, just as he was
completing "Today Is My Birthday." Cicot 2 brought it to the
festival, along with the Kantor classic "Dead Class," which I
saw. It is a haunting series of tableaux featuring people in
black outfits with white faces sitting at a row of desks as
if in a schoolroom. They are the dead, reliving and
attempting to come to terms with their past lives.
   Also from Eastern Europe was the State Theater of
Lithuania, directed by Eimuntas Nekrosius. One of his most
celebrated productions is a highly idiosyncratic "Uncle
Vanya." It has been called a "hallucination" rather than a
straight rendering of Chekhov's text. The servants, for
example, slide across the floor on felt shoe covers as if
they are ice skating, and the surly professor who brings
grief to all the lives around him walks with a cane and a
perpetual tilt-like a human Tower of Pisa.
   From Japan came "Dionysus," director Tadashi Suzuki's
version of Euripides' "The Bacchae." In the play, Pentheus
(Takahisa Nishikibe) defies the cult of Dionysus, but
eventually is enticed to observe its orgiastic revels and is
killed by the priests of Dionysus. In Mr. Suzuki's version
the high emotion of the story has been filtered through the
calm, stylized, measured movements of Japanese Noh and
Kabuki. Both visually and aurally, "Dionysus" is a
breathtaking example of ritualistic theater: The costumes,
the lighting, the controlled movements of the actors are
mesmerizing.
   The highlight of the festival's European offerings was
Ingmar Bergman's three productions from the Royal Dramatic
Theater of Sweden. Strindberg's "Miss Julie," Ibsen's "A
Doll's House" and O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
I saw the first two and both proved to be a revelation.
Without updating the plays, or resorting to other directorial
gimmicks, Mr. Bergman demonstrated that these
late-19th-century classics still reverberate with the
mysteries, the tensions, the misunderstandings of male-female
relationships.
   The female characters particularly were finely etched.
Lena Olin ("The Unbearable Lightness of Being") was a
sensual, willful, frightened Miss Julie, a count's daughter
who on Midsummer Eve becomes entangled in a fateful liaison
with her father's valet (Peter Stormare). Pernilla Ostergren
portrayed Nora in "A Doll's House" with the full dimension of
her impulsive enthusiasm at the start of the play, and with a
rich, profoundly sad maturity in the final scene when she
confronts her husband (Per Mattsson). The settings for both
plays, designed by Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss, were
semiabstract while at the same time presenting recognizable
locales.
   Among the American offerings for the festival was an
updated version of "Forbidden Broadway," the perennial spoof
of the Great White Way. As is usually the case, some skits
proved sharper and funnier than others. But all the recent
musicals -- "Will Rogers," "The Secret Garden" and "Miss
Saigon" -- came in for telling parodies. Seeing "Forbidden
Broadway" in the context of the festival underscored just how
narrow the range of Broadway offerings has become.
   A production mounted especially for the festival was
"Immigrant Voices." Audiences sailed aboard a boat past the
Statue of Liberty to Ellis Island. In the magnificently
restored building at which more than 16 million immigrants
were processed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a
dozen actors, including Geraldine Fitzgerald, Barnard Hughes,
Helen Stenborg and Ally Sheedy, read excerpts from letters
and diaries of immigrants. They reflected both the unbridled
joy of those coming here and the heart-breaking
disappointment of those who were turned away -- an apt symbol
for an international festival.

   Rolling Stone bass guitarist Bill Wyman will marry
19-year-old model Mandy Smith in June, his press agent said.
   The relationship caused a scandal in the British tabloid press
six years ago when Wyman, 52, first started dating the 13-year-old
schoolgirl. The couple later split up but have gotten back together.
   ``They are both naturally delighted,'' said the bassist's press
agent Nick Massey.
   Massey said he received the news of the marriage plans from
Wyman, who is in the United States recording for the Rolling Stones.
   The couple plan a June wedding, but have not yet decided where,

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Eudora Welty
will celebrate her 80th birthday nearly two weeks early, but the
Mississippi Symphony Orchestra already has a gift.
   The symphony on Sunday will play ``Happy Birthday'' and a
concerto written especially for her. Her birthday is April 13.
   The idea for the special tribute ``Concerto for Orchestra:
Images From Welty'' came from the symphony's conductor, Colman
Pearce.
   When he came to Jackson from Dublin, Ireland, 18 months ago,
Pearce said he ``wanted to know who were the distinguished artists
here. I made it my business to read her (Welty's) works, among
others.''
   In October 1987, initial steps were taken to commission the
work, he said. Composer Jim Sclater of Jackson was commissioned to
write the concerto.
   ``I also wanted someone who was living in Mississippi to do
this,'' Pearce explained. ``I found in Jim Sclater someone who was
attuned to it.''
   Welty, who was born in Jackson, said she has not heard the
concerto but is looking forward to the concert.
   ``You can imagine how excited and delighted I am,'' she said.
``I think it's a marvelous thing, and I'm deeply honored and
thrilled by the whole thing. Who could help but be?''

   Civil rights activist Dick
Gregory has moved his weight-reduction institute from one
beachfront resort hotel to another after plans to buy the first
fell through.
   The former comedian, who specializes in a dieting and exercise
program for severely obese people, announced last November that had
moved his institute from Newark, N.J., to the 117-room Beachmark
Inn in this Florida Panhandle city, saying he had purchased the
building for $10 million.
   But Beachmark owner Clay Ridgeway said Wednesday that Gregory
had only leased the hotel for four months with an option to buy for
$7 million. The option was exercised in January, but Gregory failed
to meet a March 1 deadline and extension for closing, Ridgeway said.
   ``Dick Gregory was good to deal with me and he put a lot of
money into this hotel while he was here,'' Ridgeway said. ``I have
no hard feelings for him. It was just a deal he couldn't do.''
   A spokeswoman for Dick Gregory's Health and Nutrition Institute
said Thursday that he was unavailable for comment.

   Ingmar Bergman's production of a
Japanese play hasn't gone before the critics yet, but it already
has been invited to go on the road.
   The famed director opens ``The Marquise de Sade,'' by Japanese
playwright Yukio Mishima, on April 8 at the Royal Dramatic Theater,
after he scrapped plans to stage Shakespeare's ``A Winter's Tale.''
   The play, with an all-female cast, has received invitations so
far from Tokyo and Denmark, theater spokesman Leif Ostman said
Thursday.
   ``Bergman is such a giant in the world that of course they are
pulling at his sleeve,'' Ostman said.
   At 70, Bergman has retired from filmmaking. Last April he
produced Eugene O'Neill's ``A Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' at
the Dramatic Theater, the same stage where it had its world
premiere 32 years earlier.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS MAKE IMPRESSIVE DEBUTS AT EUROFEST

New films by such masters as Ermanno Olmi and Jacques Rivette plus impressive 
directorial debuts from Max Von Sydow and composer Michel Legrand highlight the 
sixth American Film Institute's European Community Festival, which runs Friday 
through June 29 at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills. As before, the overall 
quality level is higher than that of the AFI's FilmFest, and at a time when 
markedly fewer foreign films are released, the EuroFest may be your one chance 
to see even the best of these offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the festival at 6:45 p.m. is Olmi's "The Legend of the Holy Drinker," a 
droll, gentle fable of beguiling beauty and religious mysticism starring Rutger 
Hauer. He plays an alcoholic vagrant with a tragic secret who receives an 
unexpected blessing, yet each time he attempts to repay it he encounters 
unexpected obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
If there's no good reason beyond the obvious commercial one for this film to be 
in English -- the setting is Paris, and Hauer plays a one-time coal miner from 
Silesia -- at least the dialogue is easy and colloquial. Hauer has a low-key 
power, Paris never looked so enticingly sleazy and romantic and "The Legend of 
the Holy Drinker," adapted from the Joseph Roth novel, is a winner -- a literal 
one having won the Italian Oscar equivalent of Best Film, Direction and 
Cinematography. (It screens again on Saturday at 12 noon). 
</P>
<P>
Rivette's "The Gang of Four" (Saturday at 3, Sunday at 2) is his usual fiercely 
demanding interplay of art and life as a group of young acting students become 
caught up in the mystery and danger engulfing a former colleague and housemate. 
"The Gang of Four" on the one hand recalls Rivette's "Paris nous appartient" in 
its evocation of paranoia and "L'Amour fou" on the other, with the students 
finding themselves playing roles in life as well as on the stage. As long (160 
minutes) and grueling as it is, "The Gang of Four" is worth the effort, and 
Rivette's young actresses lighten the journey with their loveliness, talent and 
individuality. The caring, detailed delineation of these young people coping 
with everyday life while ardently pursuing their dreams evokes both humor and 
compassion. Cast as the girls' exacting teacher is the exquisite Bulle Ogier, 
one of Rivette's favorite actresses. 
</P>
<P>
With the pure enchantment of "Katinka" (Saturday at 7), Max Von Sydow proves to 
be as skilled a director as he is an actor. This irresistible period piece, 
adapted from a novel by Herman Bang and set in rural turn-of-the-century 
Norway, is a beautifully told story of the love that develops between a young 
stationmaster's wife (Tammi Ost) and the handsome new manager of the largest 
estate in the area (Kurt Ravn). The past comes vividly alive in Von Sydow's 
loving observation of both daily life and hearty holiday celebrations. There's 
something of Renoir and, not surprisingly, much of Ingmar Bergman in this film, 
and for all the emotions Ost and Ravn stir in us over their predicament, they 
above all earn our respect for their old-fashioned sense of honor and 
responsibility, especially in regard to Ost's good-natured husband (Ole 
Ernest). 
</P>
<P>
Spanish film maker Antonio del Real's leisurely "The River That Was" (Sunday at 
6 p.m.) follows a group of loggers, headed by Alfredo Landa (star of "The Holy 
Innocents") as they guide thousands of logs down the River Tajo from Paralejos 
de las Truchas to Aranjuez. The time is 1946, and this will be the last such 
journey before trucks are to start transporting the logs. A war-weary Irishman 
of partial Spanish descent (a reflective Tony Peck) joins the loggers, whom he 
discovers to be a hearty, honorable band of free spirits at odds with a 
corrupt, fascist society. At times the film, for all its pastoral beauty, feels 
overly long and tedious, yet there's no denying that its slow pace matches the 
tempo of a way of life it depicts with such concern. 
</P>
<P>
Also screening is "The Tall Guy" (Friday at 9:10), which stars Jeff Goldblum as 
an American actor in London and which was unavailable for preview, and two 
disappointments, "Paperback Woman" (Saturday at 9, Sunday at noon) and "The 
Woman Who Dreamed" (Sunday at 8:30). More about EuroFest films, including the 
Michel Legrand film, in next week's Special Screenings. For further

<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For a decade now, Woody Allen has maintained a schizoid quality
in his films. With ``Broadway Danny Rose,'' ``The Purple Rose of
Cairo'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' he has presented the
familiar Woody Allen, the heroically neurotic chronicler of the
absurdities of urban living.
   ``Interiors,'' ``September'' and ``Another Woman,'' which Allen
wrote and directed but in which he did not appear, reflected darker
images derived from his idol, Ingmar Bergman.
   Now the twain meet in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Like all of
Allen's movies, it is idiosyncratic, highly original and
thought-provoking. But it is unexpectedly cynical.
   Two parallel but rarely converging plots deal with different
segments of Manhattan society. One is show biz. Allen is a failed
documentary maker whose devotion to esoteric subjects precludes his
success. His despairing wife, Jenny Gleason, wangles him a real
job: profiling her brother, Alan Alda, a high-powered television
producer. Allen is repelled by the crassly commercial Alda but
intrigued by his aide, Mia Farrow.
   The other plot begins with a testimonial dinner extolling the
good works of Martin Landau, a rich ophthalmologist and benefactor
with a loving wife, Claire Bloom, and family. But for two years,
Landau has had a fatal attraction to Anjelica Huston.
   When his mistress grows impatient with unkept promises, Landau
fears his comfortable world will collapse. He finds a solution
through his black-sheep brother with Mob connections, Jerry Orbach.
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' climaxes at a wedding, where most of
the cast converge. There is an epilogue in which Landau returns to
his normal, untroubled life.
   Despite the murky message, the film can be enjoyed on more than
one level. Allen's dialogue is lucid and insightful, and his
skewering of television's idiocies hits the target.
   Actors always seem to do their best work for Allen. Landau's
portrait of a good man susceptible to evil is brilliant. Alda
captures all the shrewdness and pomposity of the television breed.
Sam Waterston helps bridge the two plots as a rabbi going blind.
   The Orion release was produced by Robert Greenhut and
photographed by Bergman's favorite Sven Nykvist. Rating: PG-13 for
adult subject matter. Running time: 104 minutes.

<HEAD>A `Long Day's Journey Into Night' That Plays Better On Television</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somehow, they don't seem made for each other.
   Imagine: Eugene O'Neill, America's greatest and windiest
playwright, and television, the medium that shrank the country's
attention span.
   But director Jonathan Miller's rapid-fire revival of O'Neill's
``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' works better on the tube than it
did in the theater.
   The production, tonight's offering from ``American Playhouse''
on PBS, was seen on Broadway two years ago. It stars Jack Lemmon as
the tyrannical James Tyrone and Bethel Leslie as his drug-addled
wife Mary. Their sons are played by Peter Gallagher, who appeared
in the television movie ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' and Kevin
Spacey, before he turned into one of TV's more memorable villains
on ``Wiseguy.''
   Miller created quite a fuss in New York with his revved-up
version of what is considered O'Neill's greatest and most
autobiographical play. By overlapping dialogue and a little
cutting, Miller slashed the running time from four hours to three.
   ``The real topic of the play is a series of tellings and
listenings, of tellings and half-listenings, of tellings and
failing to listen,'' Miller said in an interview with the British
theater magazine Plays and Players.
   Everyone talks in ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which takes
place over one long summer night in 1912, and the conversations are
acrimonious, self-serving and ultimately heart-breaking.
   James Tyrone is a vainglorious husband and father. Mary is a
defeated woman, taking refuge in morphine. Her older son, Jamey, a
half-hearted actor, finds his solace in liquor, while the younger
boy, Edmund, a would-be writer modeled after O'Neill himself, finds
his career threated by tuberculosis. They blame each other, never
themselves.
   In the theater, the simultaneous conversations turned to mush.
On television, close-ups keep the audience in touch.
   Lemmon and Miss Leslie are more successful on the small screen,
too, revealing depths that were missing from their theater
performances. Lemmon captures the preening, self-centered qualities
that destroy Tyrone's wife and turn his sons against him. If the
ultimate tragedy eludes him, he gives the character a degree of
credibility.
   Miss Leslie is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage,
unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by
life. That desperation comes across in the television version and
even acquires a delicate, other- worldly character.
   Spacey and Gallagher were the strongest actors on stage and
their strengths still are evident here. Spacey is particularly
moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do
nothing about it.
   This year is the centennial of O'Neill's birth and ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' will be very much a part of worldwide
festivities. A revival directed by Ingmar Bergman just opened in
Stockholm to rave reviews.
   Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst will star in a revival this
summer on Broadway directed by Jose Quintero.
   The Broadway production and cast will alternate performances
with ``Ah, Wilderness!,'' O'Neill's only comedy.
   ``Ah, Wilderness!'' represents a sunny, innocent family life
that O'Neill wished for but never found. ``Long Day's Journey'' was
the other side of his psyche. Miller's television production
explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace.

If Plymouth's Stephen Sondheim is less appealing than Leicester's, the fact
is that A Little Night Music is in itself a less enticing proposition than
Merrily We Roll Along. It came some nine years earlier in the Sondheim
oeuvre, and the idea of setting Ingmar Bergman's romantic film-comedy Smiles
of a Summer Night to waltz-time got a brittle realisation, one that needs
all the stage help it can get.
Roger Redfarn's Plymouth production has its merits. There are pretty sets by
Martyn Bainbridge: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock-rococo
fresco, shadowy trees outside Grandmamma's chateau (far too many bright
stars, though, for a midnight-sun night). Reduced to two pianos and a cello,
all commendably expert, the score sounds brittler than ever - pastiche
operetta, even G&amp;S, with ingenious rhymes over mildly queasy
waltz-harmonies. One misses the original string ensemble. The one surefire
number, 'Send in the Clowns', comes near the end; there is nothing so
memorably apt and infectious as 'Old Friends', midstream in Merrily We Roll
Along.
The real trouble, however, lies with the adaptation (by Hugh Wheeler and
Sondheim). In Bergman's comedy, quite naturalistic and slightly cruel, a
weary, unglamorous lawyer, with a still-virgin bride of 11 months, competed
with an icily formidable Count for the favours of a famous actress (the
irreplaceable Eva Dahlbeck). In the musical the Count is only a blustering
dunderhead and the equally icy Countess a lachrymose Wronged Wife; the
lawyer becomes a mature romantic hero - attractively played here by Gary
Raymond, sung at variable pitch.
Rula Lenska puts a credible face on the actress, and Richard Lyndon and
Deborah Grant do their best for the sadly declasse aristos, but the tense
class-divisions go for nothing, leaving the story lamed. Worse, for Broadway
the ultra-dignified Grandmamma - once a famous courtesan - was turned into a
raunchy old dame, a coarse Lady Bracknell. Though Hermione Gingold just
about got away with it, this gross cartoon lies well outside Eileen Page's
more delicate range.
Kate Arneil's lusty maid is fetching, and Dermot McLaughlin makes something
of his under-written role as the lawyer's greenstick son (piety sabotaged by
rampant adolescence). The child-bride is Lisa Hollander, who sings and
smiles charmingly, and delivers each new line as if it had nothing to do
with her last one.
Plymouth Theatre Royal. Runs until 2 May.
