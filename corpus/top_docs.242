<HEAD>Alamo Management Battle Pits Hispanics Against `Daughters of Texas

   More than 150 years ago, legend has it, Alamo
commander William B. Travis drew a line across the grounds of the
old Spanish mission. He asked his men to step over it and defend
the Alamo against thousands of Mexican troops.
   Today, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, who have cared
for the Alamo for 84 years, are emulating Travis' legendary gesture
as they battle with legislators and Hispanic leaders who want to
wrestle control of the Alamo away from the 6,000-member group.
   Travis lost his battle to Santa Anna in March 1836, but Texas
troops rallied with the cry ``Remember the Alamo!'' and later
defeated Mexican troops to regain the Alamo and win Texas'
independence from Mexico.
   Now, critics of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas say the
mission would be better run by a state agency accountable to the
public, particularly in light of an audit that showed the
Daughters' Alamo chapter with a budget surplus of nearly $2 million.
   ``We aren't hiding anything. Our books are open and we are
complying with the open records and open meetings laws,'' said
Marjorie Hardy, a chapter chairwoman. Tourism officials estimate
chapter members usher close to 10 million visitors a year through
the mission in the heart of downtown.
   Shifting control to the state, Ms. Hardy said, would cost
taxpayers because state workers would be paid for duties that
volunteers now perform. As for the surplus, Ms. Hardy said it was
being saved to build a larger theater in the complex.
   ``We are very proud of what we have done with the Alamo, but we
are not bragging about ourselves. Maybe we should,'' Ms. Hardy said.
   Daughters of the Republic of Texas are descendants of people who
lived in Texas between 1836 and 1845, when it was an independent
republic before becoming part of the United States. The Daughters
received a state charter in 1905 to operate the Alamo.
   The complex includes a chapel with artifacts and flags, a
souvenir shop and research library, a small building where
documentaries are shown and enclosed grounds with several cannons
on display. Admission is free, and operating expenses are covered
by souvenir sales profits. No state money is used.
   Recently, the Daughters asked Attorney General Jim Mattox to
clarify their legal status; he ruled that the group must comply
with the state open records law because it manages a state-owned
site.
   Meanwhile, state Rep. Ron Wilson filed a bill that would
transfer control of the Alamo from the Daughters to the Texas Parks
&amp; Wildlife Department, which operates numerous state parks and
museums.
   ``It's a historical structure, probably the most historical
structure in the state, and for the state not to have control or
management of it is a little absurd,'' he said. A House committee
is slated to have a hearing on the bill later this month.
   Adding fuel to the Alamo controversy is Jose Garcia de Lara,
president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   Garcia, who says he is a descendant of Bernardo Gutierrez de
Lara, author of the Republic of Texas declaration of independence,
maintains the Alamo is a symbol of oppression for Hispanics.
   He said the League and the Daughters should work together to see
that Hispanic heroes of the Alamo _ Mexicans who fought alongside
the other Alamo defenders _ are granted the same respect as Travis,
James Bowie and Davy Crockett.
   ``The DRT has a perception that they own the Alamo and because
of that they have managed it and handled it in a way that has
excluded Hispanics from participating in historical activities,''
de Lara said.
   Adela Navarro, 85-year-old descendant of Republic of Texas
statesman Jose Antonio Navarro, also favors state control of the
Alamo, though she herself is a member of a Daughters chapter.
   ``These old girls play dirty politics. The Alamo doesn't belong
to them ...,'' Ms. Navarro said. ``They think they are superior and
they are not.''
   But supporters of the Daughters, including Mayor Henry Cisneros
and state Rep. Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, say the group has
done an admirable job of restoring the Alamo and telling the
history of Texas accurately.
   ``They are blood descendants of the heroes of the Alamo,''
Cisneros said. ``No one else will treat either the building or the
history of the period with the care and reverence they bring to the
task.''
   Garcia, who had asked the Daughters to open their records,
agrees they take care of the Alamo as no one else could and adds,
``the state is not in a position to be assuming new burdens.''
   Pauline Wilson, president of the Daughters' Alamo chapter, said
hard work went into making the Alamo the tourist attraction it is
today.
   ``The older members brought in their husbands, their kids, even
their maids to clean the place out,'' she said. ``Where were all
these people when we were having such a hard time with it?''

<MEMO>  Destination: Texas  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I definitely got hostile reactions," says Jeff Long, whose "Duel of
Eagles: The Mexican and U.S. Fight for the Alamo," was published last year.;  
 "For about two months I had crank calls at all hours, including a couple of
death threats," says Long. "Finally I had to hide behind the telephone
answering machine.";    Among Long's assertions:;    (check) Famed knife
fighter Jim Bowie wanted to surrender to Mexican General Santa Anna long
before the battle began.;    (check) Despite 26-year-old Col. William Barrett
Travis' "weird fanaticism" at times, the commander of Texas troops actually
tried to surrender just before the assault.;    (check) Both Bowie and Travis
might have committed suicide when the Mexicans breached the Alamo's defenses.;
   Such statements still stir bonfires of Lone Star pride. Many Texans are
touchiest of all over the question of how Davy Crockett died.;    Long
dismisses the idea that the former bear-fighter-turned-congressman went down
clubbing Mexican foes over the head with his Brown Bess musket -- or on the
end of a lance, as John Wayne had it in the 1960 film, "The Alamo.";   
Instead, writes Long, "David Crockett made a choice. The Go Ahead man quit. He
did more than quit. He lied. He dodged. He denied his role in the fighting.
With his life in the balance, Crockett proceeded to do what he did best:
talk.";    This story of Crockett vainly pleading for his life has been told
before. A number of Mexican eyewitnesses wrote of Crockett being brought
before Santa Anna, who they said contemptuously turned away and ordered
Crockett's execution on the spot.;    Many serious scholars of the Alamo
accept this account, which was widely reported at the time. But it never fails
to provoke an angry reaction, especially among those steeped in Hollywood
versions, beginning with the 1955 Walt Disney TV series, "Davy Crockett, King
of the Wild Frontier.";    "All these men who were at the Alamo have been
blown up over the years as such heroes of Texas history that a lot of people
don't appreciate this type of book," says Betty Burr, president general of the
Daughters of the Republic of Texas.;    The organization has operated the
Alamo, which belongs to the state, since 1905. Under the Daughters'
stewardship, according to Southern Methodist University historian David J.
Weber, the Alamo "has become a religious shrine. It's really kind of
comparable to visiting Rome.";    Controversy over the defenders' final hours
is not new. In 1975 a new English translation of a Mexican official's diary
account of Crockett's execution set off a media storm.;    The fury had not
abated by 1986, when an article about Crockett by University of New Mexico
historian Paul Andrew Hutton appeared in Texas Monthly magazine.;    "I
thought the article was hopeless, slavish hero worship," Hutton tells National
Geographic. Nevertheless, he received "some wonderful hate mail" because of
his version of Crockett's death by execution.;    Anonymous callers are not
the only people in Texas who disagree with Long's acerbic treatment of the
Alamo's defenders, however. Historian Archie P. McDonald of Stephen F. Austin
State University believes the book has a clear pro-Mexican bias throughout.;  
 "I have to be careful saying things like this, because I will be taken for
just another Texas chauvinist," says McDonald, author of a 1976 biography of
Travis. "But I don't think the sources substantiate, for example, the kind of
character assassination of Travis that comes through.";    There is no dispute
over how Evans met his death. It was witnessed by one of the women whom Santa
Anna spared.;    Evans was one of the odd collection of soldiers, speculators
and adventurers who found themselves at the old Spanish mission in the frigid
predawn hours of March 6, 1836. He died late in the 90-minute battle. A
Mexican bullet ended his desperate, unsuccessful attempt to blow up the powder
magazine and wipe out invaders and defenders alike.;    After executing a
small group of prisoners, probably including Crockett, Santa Anna had all the
Texans' bodies burned.;    Lingering questions about their final hours may lie
in some forgotten Mexican military archives. Or they may rest irretrievably
with the charred remains of the Texans, which have never been found.;  IF

   The Alamo may have been at peace since 1836,
but descendants of those who fought there have a new battle brewing
over control of $1.7 million banked from souvenir sales at the
shrine.
   The Daughters of the Republic of Texas have always had charge of
the Alamo and its bank account. But the League of United Latin
American Citizens, angered over what it calls a misrepresentation
of history by the Daughters, says they should turn any surplus over
to the state.
   ``In my opinion, all they want to do is get their hands on the
money,'' Ella Stumpf, 84, one of the Daughters, said this week.
   The Alamo is a self-financing facility: No state tax money is
invested and the Daughters must generate funds from the souvenir
shop to pay for a staff of 65 and an annual budget in excess of $1
million.
   The mission, visited by 3 million people a year, occupies four
acres of state land in downtown San Antonio. The Daughters serve at
the pleasure of the Legislature, which alone has authority to end
their custodial role.
   ``I don't think too many people knew they had $1.7 million in
the bank off sales from their souvenir shop. I don't think anyone
had ever asked,'' said state Rep. Orlando Garcia, whose inquiry
into the Alamo ledgers started the current flap.
   Garcia said unless the Daughters ``have a great purpose for
these funds'' the money could become available to the state.
   When the attorney general ruled that the Alamo finances fell
under the Texas Open Records Act, the Daughters sent a copy of
their latest audited budget to Garcia.
   ``We'd never had to face this before. ... We're happy to do
whatever the proper authorities want us to do. We don't have
anything to hide,'' said Peggy Dibrell, a member of the Daughters'
Alamo Committee.
   Attached to the audit was a note explaining the intended plans
for the surplus funds: a new film and activity center, two new
educational films and a permanent operating ``hedge'' against a
sudden drop-off in tourism.
   Jose Garcia de Lara, president of the Latin American citizens
league, was quick to call for a full accounting of the finances,
with any surplus funds be considered for other state programs.
   ``Quite frankly, we aren't very adamant about taking over the
Alamo. Our main issue is we want accountability by whomever is
running it to the peoples of the state and to the history of our
citizenry,'' he said.
   ``The Daughters have created their history by perpetuating myth
and by omission: These thousands of bad Mexicans killed our few
good Anglos and this has made the chapel a symbol of oppression.''
   About 180 Texans, including Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, died at
the Alamo fort-chapel when it was attacked by an army of thousands
of Mexicans during the Texas Revolution in 1836.
   But Garcia, the legislator, said there is no historical or
cultural component to his inquiry.
   ``I don't have time to get annoyed by what did or didn't happen
in 1836,'' he said. ``What is at issue is access to records about
finances that should be public. My name could be Davy Crockett the
Fifth and I'd be asking the same questions.''

   As world leaders at the seven-nation
economic debated the world's future, their spouses toured this
historic city for a glimpse of Texas' past.
   First Lady Barbara Bush led the summit wives on a 20-minute tour
of Mission San Jose, one of five old Spanish missions still
standing in San Antonio. The fort-like stone mission was built in
1720 by a Franciscan priest for teaching Christianity and European
culture to the Indians.
   Mrs. Bush's guests included France's Danielle Mitterrand,
Canada's Mila Mulroney, Italy's Livia Andreotti and Japan's Sachiyo
Kaifu.
   Britain's Denis Thatcher, the only male summit spouse, skipped
the tour.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors,
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   After touring the mission, the women went to a private luncheon
at the home Joci and Joe Straus, Jr., longtime friends of the
Bushes, followed by a tour of the Alamo and the renovated Majestic
Theater.
   At one time, San Antonio was a contender as the economic summit
site, but it lost out to Houston, President Bush's adopted hometown.
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and men led by Col. William Travis who were fighting
for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo's
defenders, who were besieged for 14 days before the Mexicans
attacked. All 189 of Travis' men were killed.
   The incident gave birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the
Alamo!'' used by other Texans who fought for freedom.
   After visiting San Antonio, the spouses were returning to
Houston, where they planned to tour the Texas Medical Center on
Wednesday, the final day of the summit.
   On Monday, the spouses were guests of Betty and Hugh Liedtkes,
close friends of the Bushes, for a dinner in the upscale Memorial
neighborhood in Houston.
   Liedtke is a wealthy oil man who knew Bush when the president
was in the oil business in Texas before entering politics.
   The menu included quail, gazpacho soup, shrimp creole remoulade,
poached snapper and asparagus. Dessert was called Strawberries
Summit.
   Bush and Liedtke met years ago in West Texas while both were in
the oil business, and they helped form Zapata Petroleum.
Eventually, the company's investors spilt, although Liedtke and
Bush remained friends.
   Liedtke is the former chief of Houston-based Pennzoil Co., the
oil company that won an $10.3 billion judgment in 1985 from Texaco
Inc. over Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil Co. Pennzoil later settled
for $3 billion.
   Liedtke is still chairman of Pennzoil's board.

   As the summit leaders focus on global issues,
their spouses have a full schedule of sightseeing and socializing,
starting with a private dinner at friends of President Bush's
Monday night.
   The seven leaders of the industrialized world planned a working
dinner Monday at Bayou Bend, a mansion-turned-museum, while they
spouses were guests of Betty and Hugh Liedtkes.
   The Liedtkes, close friends of both Bush and his wife, Barbara,
invited the spouses to their home for dinner in the upscale
Memorial neighborhood. Liedtke is a wealthy oil man who knew Bush
when the president was in the oil business in Texas before entering
politics.
   On Tuesday, the spouses planned to fly to San Antonio to tour
the Alamo, the Mission San Jose and the renovated Majestic Theatre.
San Antonio also was in the running to host the economic summit,
but the city lost out to Houston, Bush's adopted hometown. .
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and a group of men led by Col. William Travis who were
fighting for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo
forces, although historical records do not provide an exact number.
The Mexican soldiers laid siege on the Alamo for 14 days before
attacking.
   All of Travis' men _ 189 _ were killed, and the tragic fight
gave birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the Alamo!'' for other
Texans fighting for freedom.
   After visiting San Antonio, the spouses were to return to
Houston. They also planned to tour the Texas Medical Center on
Wednesday, the final day of the summit.
   Besides Mrs. Bush, the spouses include France's Danielle

spouse.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   The wives of several other local leaders also planned to attend
Monday night's dinner at the Liedtke home. The menu included quail,
gazpacho soup, shrimp creole remoulade, poached snapper and
asparagus. Dessert was called strawberries summit.
   After dinner, the group was to be entertained by a string trio
and a singing duo. The trio's members are all teen-agers.

   At age 65, native Texan George A.
McAlister is a big, friendly, drawling former coach, educator and
inventor turned businessman, rancher, historian, author and dreamer.
   His dream was to make a film based on the battle of the Alamo.
That dream is coming true.
   With blazing cannons and bloody sabres, the heroes of the Alamo
relive on a giant new screen this week the fateful 13-day siege
that inspired Texas to win its independence from Mexico in 1836. A
black-tie premiere of the docudrama is set for Saturday.
   Entitled ``Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' the 45-minute film
is an account of the battle based largely on the research and books
of McAlister, and it has stirred some controversy.
   Academy Award-winning filmmaker Kieth Merrill directed the
movie, part of a $7.2 million project that includes a new IMAX
theater with its 84{-foot wide, six-story high screen. The 426-seat
theater is housed in the new Rivercenter Mall, which overlooks the
Alamo grounds.
   The IMAX system is designed to give viewers visually stunning
images as well as a sense of participation in the on-screen
activity.
   ``The Price of Freedom'' was filmed last summer at Alamo Village
near Brackettville, where John Wayne built the set for his epic
1960 film, ``The Alamo.''
   Saturday's premiere benefits the research library operated by
the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and includes a reception and
dinner-dance and remarks by Dallas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   Gov. Bill Clements will be on hand the next day for formal
dedication ceremonies, which coincide with the 152nd anniversary of
the fall of the Alamo to Mexican Gen. Santa Anna.
   ``There are two great symbols of freedom in America,'' McAlister
said. ``First is the Statue of Liberty. But it is just that _ a
symbol of freedom. Then there is this old stone mission, the Alamo,
a shrine to the price of freedom.
   ``And there is a difference between a symbol of freedom and a
price of freedom.''
   A veteran of World War II and the Korean conflict, McAlister
pointed out gently that a lot of people are willing to live for a
cause but only a very few are willing to die for one.
   ``The defenders of the Alamo were willing to die for freedom,''
he said. ``And more than 3 million people from all over the world
came to the Alamo last year to pay homage to those 189 brave men
who gave their lives that Texas might be free.''
   McAlister once stood outside the Alamo for days asking visitors
if they would pay to see an authentic movie of the historic battle
and if they were familiar with IMAX theaters.
   He liked the answers. And the premiere this weekend showcases
the results of that private poll.
   While stressing the importance of authenticity, McAlister points
out quickly that much of what occurred at the Alamo is subject to
speculation and individual interpretation.
   ``There are no chronicles of the Alamo and what happened
there,'' he said.
   Still, McAlister spent 12 years researching his books. His
travels took him to Goliad, San Jacinto, Washington-on-the-Brazos
and other battle sites and to Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina
and Alabama to visit the hometowns of the most famous defenders of
the Alamo: Col. William B. Travis, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and
James Bonham.
   McAlister also describes the Alamo contribution of the Tejanos,
the nine Mexicans who supported the Texas cause.
   He and his colleagues say they have made their movie as
historically accurate as possible without sacrificing dramatic and
entertainment value.
   ``If we were going to make a movie for several generations, I
did not want it to be fiction,'' McAlister said.
   The movie has no stars but uses 450 members of war-enactment
societies across the country who are dedicated to historical
accuracy, costume and customs.
   McAlister was surprised and dismayed when San Antonio City
Councilman Walter Martinez and a group of residents accused the
producers of distorting historical facts.
   After viewing a rough cut of the movie, Martinez complained that
the film demeaned Hispanics by making them look like bad guys, and
presented a list of objections to Texas Cavalcade Corp., the
production group headed by McAlister.
   Kathy Pena-Sosa, a spokeswoman for Texas Cavalcade, said some
objectionable scenes were deleted in the final editing from 73
minutes to 45 minutes, but professed to be puzzled by the criticism.
   ``In a community that's 54 percent Hispanic,'' she said, ``we're
not going to make a movie that's offensive to Hispanics.''
   Born and raised in East Texas, McAlister got his first exposure
to Texas history in a two-room, two-teacher schoolhouse in a tiny
hamlet near Commerce.
   He interrupted his collegiate studies at East Texas State in
1942 to enlist in the Marines, but returned after the war to get a
master's degree in math. His minor was history.
   During an academic career that was interrupted when he was
recalled to active duty in Korea in 1950, McAlister was a dean at
Howard County Junior College in Big Spring, as well as chairman of
the math department, coach of the track team and an amateur
inventor.
   In 1955, with $150, he founded a company called GAMCO to create
and build teaching aids for math students, including a classroom
computer and an electronic teaching machine. The sale of GAMCO in
1966 made him a millionaire.
   It also freed him to pursue his ranching and writing interests
and to devote more time to historical research.
   His first novel, ``Nothing is Forever,'' was based on the early
life of Travis. That book evolved into a second novel, ``A Time to
Love ... A Time to Die.''
   This led in turn to ``Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' a
non-fiction book which McAlister describes as ``history as I view
it and my personal research reveals it.''
   For McAlister, ``The Price of Freedom'' is more than a movie or
a business venture.
   Said he: ``I would like to leave a legacy on the screen that
retells the story of this sacrifice for freedom ... that
demonstrates to a new generation that freedom isn't free ... that
liberty rests finally on those willing to die for it.''

   Your June 10 article calling Alamo, Texas, the "famous
namesake of a lost cause" must have raised the hair on the
nape of every Texan and student of Texas history. Of course,
you were referring to the Battle of the Alamo, which took
place in San Antonio in March 1836. But as to the "lost
cause," I haven't a clue as to what you were talking about.
The Texas Revolution, of which the siege of the Alamo was an
integral part, was far from a lost cause.
   The delay inflicted upon the Mexican army by the tenacious
defenders of the Alamo gave Sam Houston time to gather his
ragtag Texan irregulars and make a stand a month later at the
Battle of San Jacinto, near what is now Houston. There they
routed Santa Anna's army and won independence for the
Republic of Texas.

<TEXT>
   If the Alamo had been part of a lost cause, there would
not only be no Texas, but probably no Wyoming, New Mexico,
Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada or California, since these
states came into being as a direct result of the Texas
Revolution and the subsequent U.S. and Mexican War nine years
later.

   First lady Barbara Bush met with young cancer
patients today while the wives of the other summit leaders toured
different parts of the renowned Texas Medical Center.
   The women visited the medical center this morning before their
husbands issued their final communique on the three-day summit at
the George R. Brown Convention Center.
   Mrs. Bush went to the pediatric division of the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center where she talked with children attending summer
classes at the hospital.
   One of the patients, 15-year-old Denis Lokter, came from the
Soviet Union to get treatment.
   ``We had a wonderful visit from your president,'' Mrs. Bush told
the youth referring Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent trip
to the United States.
   The children gave her a book filled with drawings of dinosaurs
they had made on a computer. They also presented her with a package
of Christmas cards designed by children at the hospital.
   ``I think she was really good,'' said Patrick Chapman, who
turned 7 today.
   ``She called me a nickname _ Fang _ because I don't have a tooth
here,'' he said referring to his missing front tooth.
   Mrs. Bush was joined by France's Danielle Mitterrand, Canada's
Mila Mulroney, Italy's Livia Andreotti, and Japan's Sachiyo Kaifu.
They went to different hospitals at the 600-acre medical center
complex that includes 14 hospitals and two medical schools and four
nursing schools.
   England's Denis Thatcher, the only male spouse, did not visit a
hospital.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Bush took the four women to San Antonio to
visit an 18th century mission and the Alamo, while Thatcher visited
his son, Mark, in Dallas.
   ``Nobody can come to Texas without seeing the Alamo,'' Mrs. Bush
told the crowd of several hundred people who braved the heat and
lined up along police barricades to cheer the first ladies.
   ``I wanted to show off a different part of Texas. I wanted them
to see a side of Texas that you might not see any place else, not
only in Texas but in this country,'' she said.
   ``You've really turned out for us and given us a wonderful
day.'' she said.
   At the Alamo, San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell gave the women
proclamations saying they were all ``alcaldes,'' or mayors, of the
original San Antonio.
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and a group of men led by Col. William Travis who were
fighting for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo
forces, although historical records do not provide an exact number.
The Mexican soldiers laid siege on the Alamo for 14 days before
attacking.
   All 189 of Travis' men were killed, and the tragic fight gave
birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the Alamo!''
   Earlier, the women were greeted by about 900 children at the
Majestic Theater, a palatial theater built in 1929 and restored and
reopened last August.
   The children, from the city's parks and recreation program, were
told about their prestigious visitors only at the last minute. They
cheered and waved miniature Texas flags as the women entered the
ornate theater.
   The spouses also visited the Mission San Jose where they heard
traditional mariachi music.
   The mission, established in 1720 by a Franciscan priest, is one
of five old Spanish missions still standing in San Antonio.

<TEXT>
   A picturesque river winds through historic
downtown. Adventurous sorts explore ancient Spanish missions - and
spicy Mexican food. Margaritas and mariachi music abound.
   It's all part of the appeal of San Antonio, a place of history
and romance, where diversions are many.
   From its quaint restaurants and pubs along the popular River
Walk to the museums of the nearby Alamo, this city of a million
people - the nation's ninth-largest - fascinates all ages. And the
friendly, relaxed mood is instantly pleasing.
   ``Charming, that's the word we hear a lot,'' says Frances
Schultschik of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``There are a
lot of things for people to do, with the history and the charm.''
   By far the most popular destination is the Alamo, site of a 1836
battle in which 189 Texas patriots died at the hands of the Mexican
army of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
   Established in 1718, the Alamo, or Mission San Antonio de
Valero, was one of a chain of Spanish missions built by Franciscan
friars trying to introduce Christianity to the Indians. The Texans
later used the Alamo as a fort in the war for independence from
Mexico.
   Missions San Jose, Concepcion, San Juan Capistrano and Espada
also dot the city as part of the San Antonio Missions National
Historical Park. Each of the missions has an active parish church.
They are popular spots for traditional San Antonio weddings.
   La Villita is another must-see attraction for history-lovers.
This downtown village is nestled along the San Antonio River and
houses shops and art galleries in its old buildings.
   The Menger Hotel, built in the 19th century next to the Alamo,
has gone through several restorations to preserve its historic
atmosphere. The hotel's bar, where Theodore Roosevelt recruited his
``Rough Riders,'' is filled with folklore.
   Across downtown, a literal taste of San Antonio awaits at Market
Square, patterned after a traditional Mexican market. The famous Mi
Tierra and La Margarita restaurants serve up sizzling fajitas,
savory enchiladas and other favorite Mexican foods and beverages.
Jovial mariachi musicians provide the entertainment.
   Just as popular are the market's assortment of gift shops and
its dozens of trinket-selling vendors in the huge El Mercado.
   The ultimate San Antonio event takes place each spring when the
entire city lets loose for ``Fiesta.'' Dozens of festivals, parades
and other special events take over the city during the wild
three-week party.
   Festivals also are part of San Antonio's charm the rest of the
year.
   The Texas Folk Life Festival on the grounds of the Institute of
Texan Cultures in early August celebrates the diverse ethnic
heritage of the state with food, music and dancing.
   A festival of lights illuminates the River Walk at Christmas. A
10-day St. Patrick's Day celebration - featuring the river dyed
green - takes place in March. Various other art and music festivals
occur throughout the year.
   ``The city is known for its fiestas - just about any time of
year you can come down here and be a part of some event that's
going on,'' Ms. Schultschik says.
   For visitors who like amusement parks or animals, San Antonio
has at least two major attractions.
   At Sea World of Texas, killer whales, dolphins and sea lions
perform shows, and sharks, penguins and other sea creatures are
exhibited in natural settings.
   The internationally known San Antonio Zoo has 3,612 animals,
representing 674 species. Its African antelope collection is one of
the largest and most varied in the world. It's the only zoo
exhibiting an endangered whooping crane.
   In 1992, the city will greet its newest attraction, a musical
theme park called ``Fiesta Texas.'' Park developers, who also
created Opryland in Nashville, say Fiesta Texas will feature the
music and culture of Texas and the Southwest.

<TEXT>
   Davy Crockett probably wasn't born on a
mountaintop in Tennessee. And nobody really thinks he shot a bear
when he was only 3.
   But that doesn't take anything away from the legend, at least
for the 180 Crockett descendants gathering in Texas this week.
   ``Those kinds of things are interesting to read about, but they
don't necessarily reflect the real David Crockett,'' said Leonard
Stasney, one of the Crockett descendants holding their fifth
biennial reunion at this town, 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth.
Davy's widow settled in Granbury after his death at the battle of
the Alamo in San Antonio in 1836.
   ``The myth was bigger than the man,'' said descendant Sandra
Weaver of Granbury, who wore a cloth Crockett doll with a real coon
tail on the cap, the whole thing pinned to her shoulder like a huge
corsage.
   Ms. Weaver and Crockett kin traded tales about their famous
ancestor Tuesday at the clan picnic, swapped gossip and argued over
the best place to get a genuine coonskin cap.
   They debated how often a fighter could fire the muskets of
Davy's day and whether Crockett was killed in action or, as some
historians say, executed by the Mexicans after surrendering the
Alamo.
   ``Davy Crockett went down swinging a rifle _ he wasn't no
coward,'' insisted Charles Edward Crockett Sr. of Falls City, Ore.
   ``It just doesn't matter,'' Ms. Weaver said. ``All the men who
died at the Alamo were heroes.''
   For the descendants gathered at Granbury's Plantation Inn, it's
the search for a ``real'' Davy Crockett that matters most.
   And according to them, that's not the Davy Crockett a generation
of Americans knew from the Disney TV series that made the
buckskin-clad actor Fess Parker an instant celebrity and prompted
millions of youngsters to buy coonskin caps.
   The show became one of the biggest overnight hits in television
history. Ninety million people watched the TV Davy swing his rifle
as Santa Anna's troops attacked the Alamo, according to Disney
productions. ``The Ballad of Davy Crockett,'' the theme song of the
series, sold 18 million copies in 1955, Billboard said.
   Joy Bland, the new president of the descendants' group,
dismisses all that as Hollywood glamour.
   ``They don't stick to the real facts. I never could sit through
the whole program. It was awful,'' said Ms. Bland, of Paris, Tenn.
``The clothing was too modern; the story line was unrealistic.''
   Only one descendant donned a coonskin cap for the reunion, and
he was in period costume to demonstrate the rifles and muskets of
Crockett's era.
   About 200 people belong to the non-profit corporation
Descendants of David Crockett, based in Tennessee. Members must be
blood relations to Crockett. Associate memberships are extended to
cousins, historians and others who revere the pioneer.
   ``It's kind of exciting to talk to all the people that you are
related to that you don't really know,'' Stasney said. ``It's just
exciting to know that we can share the little bits and pieces of
information and learn a little more about who we are.''
   Some said it's simply a relief to tell people they're Crockett
descendants and be believed.
   Toni Daigle of Whitecastle, La., said she takes pictures and
documents to her children's school to convince classmates they
really are related to the famous frontiersman.
   ``It's hard,'' Ms. Daigle said, ``because some other kids come
up and say, ``Oh yeah _ I'm kin to Abraham Lincoln, too.''

<TEXT>
   Hispanic and black leaders are urging
Austin school officials to name a new high school after someone
other than Alamo hero James Bowie, arguing that Bowie was a slave
trader.
   Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP's Austin chapter, said
Bowie isn't the kind of person whose name should be on a school.
   ``The plain and simple truth, according to some of the most
noted Texas historians ... is that Jim Bowie smuggled slaves into
North America, sold them at vastly inflated prices, owned then,
sold fictitious land grants for Texas land, fraudulently sold land
owned by his in-laws and committed many other heinous and nefarious
acts,'' Bledsoe said.
   Black and Hispanic leaders have suggested naming the school
after a Hispanic. No Austin high school has a Hispanic namesake.
   The Daughters of the Republic of Texas and 420 other people
recommended that the school be named for Bowie. In a March vote,
the Austin Independent School District Board of Trustees approved
Bowie's name for the school with two board members dissenting. For
the matter to be reheard, a board member who voted in favor of
Bowie's name must move for reconsideration. No such motion was made
at the panel's latest meeting Monday.
   A Kentucky native, Bowie was an adventurer who by age 18 had
earned a reputation for riding alligators and wrestling bears. In
1828, he moved to Texas and settled in San Antonio. After first
sharing command at the Alamo with William B. Travis, Bowie fell ill
and died on March 6, 1836, when Mexican soldiers captured the
mission. A county and a city in Texas are named for him.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and others sent a letter complaining of the name choice to the
school board April 11.

   Educators here have drawn the line against
naming a school for the Alamo hero William Barret Travis. The
problem: skeletons in his closet.
   It turns out the man who drew the famous line in the dirt during
the defense of the chapel-fort in 1836 abandoned his wife and child
and owned slaves.
   Bryan school trustees voted Monday night to name the school
instead after black educator Mary Branch, the first woman college
president in Texas.
   Countless schools and streets in Texas are named for Travis. In
fact, the school named for Branch will replace Bryan's Travis
Elementary School, which will close next year. Bryan is a town of
59,000 about 60 miles from Houston.
   During the siege of the Alamo, Travis wrote an appeal for help.
Legend also has it that when the defenders were surrounded by
Mexican troops, he drew a line and asked those willing to die for
freedom to cross it with him.
   Trustee Wendy Costa pointed out that Travis had abandoned his
family. Noting also that Bryan's population is 22 percent black, she
asked, ``How can we even consider naming a school after someone who
was so strongly in favor of slavery?''
   Bob Calvert of the Texas State Historical Society described
Travis as a ``ne'er-do-well who in two weeks' time happened to do
something wonderful.''
   ``All of my life I've been told that William Barret Travis is the
greatest Texas hero,'' said Trustee Travis Bryan Jr. ``No power on
earth can convince me he's not, not even Wendy Costa.''
   ``The name of William Barret Travis must be sustained. I'm going
to vote for him, even if everybody votes against me,'' Bryan said.
   The vote was 4-3 in favor of Ms. Branch.

The idea was to kidnap John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Texas filming 'The Alamo.' One day at lunch I made the suggestion 
to a bunch of the Mexican extras working in the picture as Santa Anna's troops. 
I didn't tell them I was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Look. Texas belonged to Mexico. It was literally stolen from us. What 
I'm going to propose to you is dangerous, so if you want to forget it, OK. . . 
.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I can get live ammunition. . . .' At this point, everyone became very tense. 
I told them: 'We get this tall guy -- what's his name? Win? Wino? We kidnap him 
and contact Washington. We'll give him back if the United States will give us 
Texas back.' 
</P>
<P>
"One colonel said he had a family to think of. Another said the U.S. Army was 
only two hours away and, 'They'll wipe us out.' I said, 'Yes. But we'll die as 
heroes.' The next day I had lunch alone." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was Ruben Dario Padilla Colon y Magallanes, a longtime San Diegan 
reminiscing about a kaleidoscopic and sometimes fascinating life on both sides 
of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
An interview related to Padilla's 80th birthday evoked memories of those deeds 
that have entertained him, from his career in the film industry to wearing 
pistol and badge as police chief of Texcoco, to working in tourism and politics 
and publicity in San Diego and Baja California Norte, and more. 
</P>
<P>
In his milieu, "everyone," it seems, 
</P>
<P>
knows Padilla, and he knows "everyone." He is one of those binationals common 
along the border, but nothing is common about him. Padilla is a gregarious, 
knowledgeable, humorous character, quick with a joke, a fact or a connection, a 
man known to be able to get the job done or send you to someone who can. He can 
even get you out of jail with a phone call, two at the most (Tijuana or 
Mexicali only). 
</P>
<P>
In "The Alamo," Padilla portrays Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, leading his 
soldiers at San Antonio against defenders holed up in the old mission called 
The Alamo. It was filmed in 1959 near Brackettville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many lines," Padilla said, "but Santa Anna is referred to all 
the way through, so he's a major character." 
</P>
<P>
And of course he had to ride a white horse, as was Santa Anna's custom. Former 
Texas Gov. Price Daniels provided his horse, White Cloud. Ruben Padilla had 
never ridden. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Santa Anna was to appear at the head of his troops, Michael 
Wayne, the actor's son, told Padilla, who was wearing an authentic 1836 Mexican 
army uniform: "You'd better mount." 
</P>
<P>
"Mount what?" Padilla asked. "I've never ridden before." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better tell Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla said, "You tell him." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Padilla learned to manage on horseback, although once during a 
charge he fell. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard was, 'Cut, cut, cut,' " Padilla said. "And I never heard so much 
cussing (from John Wayne) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, originally a researcher for the film and assistant to the producer, 
was selected for the role in a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cameo part, so they needed someone famous or an unknown. Marlon Brando 
turned it down. Then they got a young fellow locally." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Widmark and Laurence Harvey, also in the film, objected because of 
the candidate's youth. Someone mentioned that Padilla had acting experience. 
Padilla continued: 
</P>
<P>
"John Wayne said, 'He doesn't look like Santa Anna.' I told him, 'You don't 
look like Jim Bowie, either.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another cameo role was filled by the famed bullfighter, Carlos Arruza, who 
portrays a Mexican lieutenant delivering a message to Bowie, Travis, Crockett 
and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Pedro Vargas refused the role. So Padilla, for many years one of 
Arruza's best friends, arranged for the matador to handle it. "Arruza got 
$20,000 for the part." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Padilla's life has centered around movie making and bullfighting. 
Friends in one field often led him to the other in a glamorous and pleasant 
ricochet. The pattern for this life may have been cut by Padilla's father, 
Dario, a Mexican importer-exporter who was a friend of the first great Mexican 
bullfighter, Rodolfo Gaona.

<P>
However, for Ruben Padilla, born in Guadalajara on Feb. 16, 1910, the first 
personal step was his fast friendship with another star matador, Silverio 
Perez, whom he met in the early 1940s at Mexicali, where Silverio -- 
immortalized in song and politics as well as in the taurine world -- was 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla lived across the border in Calexico, where the family had moved in 1923 
after spending four years in San Francisco to avoid the terrors and confusions 
of the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hotel Caesar in Tijuana after a bullfight in the early 1940s, Padilla 
introduced Perez and other matadors to producer-director Budd Boetticher. 
</P>
<P>
"Budd had a script, "Torero," which became "The Bullfighter and the Lady," 
Padilla said. 'Wayne had just finished 'Sands of Iwo Jima' and had quite a bit 
of money. Budd contacted him about financing the movie, and Wayne was 
interested. He called me at Calexico (to arrange for bullfighters). He was very 
concerned about how much the matadors would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Yes, Mr. Wayne?' " And in that slow resonant voice, Wayne told 
Padilla: "My friends call me Duke." And that started a friendship that ended 
only with Wayne's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla arranged for the matadors. And so Wayne financed "The Bullfighter and 
the Lady" with a $450,000 budget ("A lot of money then," Padilla said). Padilla 
portrayed the impresario in a cast that included Robert Stack, Gilbert Roland, 
Katy Jurado and Virginia Grey. It was filmed in Mexico City. Naturally, there 
was an occasional party. 
</P>
<P>
"Stack liked the sauce made from maguey worms until we told him what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla portrayed Pedro in Boetticher's film "Wings of the Hawk," starring Van 
Heflin; was adviser for the bullfight sequence in "Mexican Hayride" with Abbott 
and Costello; was assistant to the producer in "The War Wagon," filmed in 
Mexico with Kirk Douglas; was in Boetticher's documentary, "Arruza," narrated 
by Anthony Quinn, whom Padilla met at Hotel Caesar, naturally, "in the early 
1940s," and enjoyed his most important role as the detective in the 
Mexican-Italian movie "Bus Ride." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla enjoyed a brief taurine career as bullring judge at Mexicali and 
Tijuana, twice having matadors arrested for allowing picadors to abuse bulls. 
And, in the 1950s, at San Diego's Balboa Stadium, he staged what was probably 
the first bloodless bullfight in California. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he helped a young American woman obtain her start in the 
entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the early 1940s," Padilla said. "The manager of the Hotel de Anza in 
Calexico called me. He said he had a problem with a guest, a young girl who 
hadn't paid her bill in three weeks. 'She says she has a contact.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I went to her room. Her name was Yolanda Warren. She was a beautiful girl, 
a brunette, about 16 or 17. I read the contract. It was for a nightclub that 
didn't exist. But she had to go to Mexico City to make a success of herself. I 
took her to eat. I advised her against going. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But Warren, from Washington state, was determined to make her mark in the 
Mexican capital. Padilla contacted Silverio Perez, who was fighting in Mexicali 
on the following Sunday. One of the matador's assistants could drive Warren to 
Mexico City as he returned. 
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday she called me from El Paso. The assistant wanted to place her in a 
brothel. I gave her some phone numbers in Mexico City and wired her some 
money." 
</P>
<P>
On her own, she obtained a job dancing at a cheap cabaret in Mexico City. Her 
style was Tahitian. One night an important politician, out slumming, was 
attracted to her. He tore some big bills in half and sent one set of the halves 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
"She spurned him. There was a big scene, big headlines in the papers. The 
cabaret became famous, and she did too." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, using a name that complemented her sensuous movements, she became the 
most famous dancer in Latin America and Asia: Tongolele. (Now living in Mexico 
City as Yolanda Montes, Tongolele made a guest appearance last fall at a 
benefit for ailing bandleader Perez Prado. Her old movies are on Channel 12.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the matador Silverio was unable to help Padilla in the Tongolele 
episode, he arranged for his friend's only experience in law enforcement. It 
was in the winter of 1967-68, during one of Silverio's three terms as mayor of 
Texcoco, the small and historic town that had been home to Netzahualcoyotl, the 
cultured Chichimeca king and poet crowned there in 1428. 
</P>
<P>
"Silverio appointed me police chief to bring tourism from Mexico City," Padilla 
said. "Fortunately, I had a great assistant chief. One night there was a 
shooting at a dance. A couple of brothers killed a couple of other men. I 
suggested sending out a posse. The assistant chief suggested taking it easy. He 
said the killers weren't professionals, that they had family in Texcoco, that 
we should play it cool. 
</P>
<P>
"In a month they were spotted in a local market. I didn't go for them. I all of 
a sudden had a cold." 
</P>
<P>
The assistant chief arrested the pair without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
For a six-year term starting in 1953, when Baja California Norte became a 
state, Padilla was the first state tourism director. In that capacity, he often 
arranged front-row bullfight seats for Quinn, Orson Welles and other Hollywood 
personalities. Simultaneously, Padilla was secretary general of the 
"middle-class" sector for Mexico's ruling political party. 
</P>
<P>
Now he lives in Mission Hills, an easy walk to the shops and restaurants in the 
vicinity of Goldfinch and Washington streets, directs U.S. publicity for the 
Tijuana bullfights and keeps in touch with his family, including brother Oscar, 
well known in local politics and in the insurance business; son Ruben Jr., also 
an insurance executive; son Marco Antonio, a U.S. Customs inspector; and two 
granddaughters and three grandsons, including Ruben, a magician. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who retained his Mexican citizenship, critically observes activities 
major and minor on both sides of the border. For instance, on the Tijuana 
traffic circles called gloriettas: 
</P>
<P>
"Approach them according to your machismo and the weight of your vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
On the future of Tijuana: 
</P>
<P>
"There is really a new Tijuana now. Tourists should feel no qualms about 
visiting. . . . The main problem is lack of water." 
</P>
<P>
And he denigrates use of the words "Hispanic" and "Chicano" to describe 
Mexicans or Mexican-Americans -- Hispanic because it belongs rightly to 
Spaniards only, he says, the other because it is recently coined and of 
uncertain origin. He is a Mexican, he will tell you, descended from Spaniards 
and Indians.

   In your Jan. 20 article "Mexico Guards Its Precious Oil
Business," there are serious discrepancies, i.e., "Yankee
interlopers, who, after all, took oil-rich Texas from Mexico
in 1848."
   Texas took itself from Mexico on April 21, 1836, defeating
Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in the 20-minute Battle of
San Jacinto, as every third-grader in Texas could tell you --
or could have in 1927, anyway.

   A $3.5 million offer for a knife believed to have
belonged to James Bowie during the battle of the Alamo was
withdrawn because the dagger's owner refused to have it tested for
authenticity.
   Spirit of the Alamo, a non-profit fund-raising group, dropped
the offer, president John Stokes said Saturday.
   Bartley Dean Moore of Riverside, Calif., said family lore has it
that a young Mexican soldier found the knife after the mission fell
in 1836. In 1890, the soldier gave the knife to Moore's grandfather
in Texas to settle a $5 debt, the story goes.
   Museum curators and other experts discounted the claim.
   The fund-raising group, formed last year, had agreed to pay $3.5
million if the knife proved genuine, but wanted tests to determine
its age and metal content.
   All 187 American defenders, including Bowie and Davy Crockett,
were killed in the 13-day siege of the Alamo. Legend credits Bowie
with inventing what is now known as the bowie knife.

The idea was to kidnap John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Texas filming 'The Alamo.' One day at lunch I made the suggestion 
to a bunch of the Mexican extras working in the picture as Santa Anna's troops. 
I didn't tell them I was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Look. Texas belonged to Mexico. It was literally stolen from us. What 
I'm going to propose to you is dangerous, so if you want to forget it, OK. . . 
.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I can get live ammunition. . . .' At this point, everyone became very tense. 
I told them: 'We get this tall guy -- what's his name? Win? Wino? We kidnap him 
and contact Washington. We'll give him back if the United States will give us 
Texas back.' 
</P>
<P>
"One colonel said he had a family to think of. Another said the U.S. Army was 
only two hours away and, 'They'll wipe us out.' I said, 'Yes. But we'll die as 
heroes.' The next day I had lunch alone." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was Ruben Dario Padilla Colon y Magallanes, a longtime San Diegan 
reminiscing about a kaleidoscopic and sometimes fascinating life on both sides 
of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
An interview related to Padilla's 80th birthday evoked memories of those deeds 
that have entertained him, from his career in the film industry to wearing 
pistol and badge as police chief of Texcoco, to working in tourism and politics 
and publicity in San Diego and Baja California Norte, and more. 
</P>
<P>
In his milieu, it seems that everyone knows Padilla and he knows everyone. He 
is one of those binationals common along the border, but nothing is common 
about him. Padilla is a gregarious, knowledgeable, humorous character, quick 
with a joke, a fact or a connection, a man known to be able to get the job done 
or send you to someone who can. He can even get you out of jail with a phone 
call, two at the most (Tijuana or Mexicali only). 
</P>
<P>
In "The Alamo," Padilla portrays Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, leading his 
soldiers at San Antonio against defenders holed up in the old mission called 
The Alamo. It was filmed in 1959 near Brackettville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many lines," Padilla said, "but Santa Anna is referred to all 
the way through, so he's a major character." 
</P>
<P>
And of course he had to ride a white horse, as was Santa Anna's custom. Former 
Texas Gov. Price Daniels provided his horse, White Cloud. Padilla had never 
ridden. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Santa Anna was to appear at the head of his troops, Michael 
Wayne, the actor's son, told Padilla, who was wearing an authentic 1836 Mexican 
army uniform: "You'd better mount." 
</P>
<P>
"Mount what?" Padilla asked. "I've never ridden before." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better tell Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla said, "You tell him." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Padilla learned to manage on horseback, although once during a 
charge he fell. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard was, 'Cut, cut, cut,' " Padilla said. "And I never heard so much 
cussing (from John Wayne) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Padilla's life has revolved around filmmaking and bullfighting. Friends 
in one field often led him to the other in a glamorous and pleasant ricochet. 
The pattern for this life may have been cut by Padilla's father, Dario, a 
Mexican importer-exporter who was a friend of the first great Mexican 
bullfighter, Rodolfo Gaona. 
</P>
<P>
However, for Ruben Padilla, born in Guadalajara on Feb. 16, 1910, the first 
personal step was his fast friendship with another star matador, Silverio 
Perez, whom he met in the early 1940s at Mexicali, where Silverio -- 
immortalized in song and politics as well as in the taurine world -- was 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla lived across the border in Calexico, where the family had moved in 1923 
after spending four years in San Francisco to avoid the terrors and confusions 
of the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hotel Caesar in Tijuana after a bullfight in the early 1940s, Padilla 
introduced Perez and other matadors to producer-director Budd Boetticher. 
</P>
<P>
"Budd had a script, "Torero," which became "The Bullfighter and the Lady," 
Padilla said. 'Wayne had just finished 'Sands of Iwo Jima' and had quite a bit 
of money. Budd contacted him about financing the movie, and Wayne was 
interested. He called me at Calexico (to arrange for bullfighters). He was very 
concerned about how much the matadors would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>

Padilla: "My friends call me Duke." And that started a friendship that ended 
only with Wayne's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla arranged for the matadors. And so Wayne financed "The Bullfighter and 
the Lady" with a $450,000 budget ("A lot of money then," Padilla said). Padilla 
portrayed the impresario in a cast that included Robert Stack, Gilbert Roland, 
Katy Jurado and Virginia Grey. It was filmed in Mexico City. Naturally, there 
was an occasional party. 
</P>
<P>
"Stack liked the sauce made from maguey worms until we told him what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla portrayed Pedro in Boetticher's film "Wings of the Hawk," starring Van 
Heflin; was adviser for the bullfight sequence in "Mexican Hayride" with Abbott 
and Costello; was assistant to the producer in "The War Wagon," filmed in 
Mexico with Kirk Douglas; was in Boetticher's documentary "Arruza," narrated by 
Anthony Quinn, whom Padilla met at Hotel Caesar, naturally, "in the early 
1940s," and enjoyed his most important role as the detective in the 
Mexican-Italian movie "Bus Ride." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla enjoyed a brief taurine career as bullring judge at Mexicali and 
Tijuana, twice having matadors arrested for allowing picadors to abuse bulls. 
And, in the 1950s, at San Diego's Balboa Stadium, he staged what was probably 
the first bloodless bullfight in California.

<HEAD>Workers Find Graffiti Possibly Left By Alamo Defender</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Workers at the Alamo discovered graffiti that
may have been left by an Alamo defender in 1836 on a door of the
mission.
   ``We found original mission plaster,'' Alamo Curator Steve Beck
said. ``There is graffiti in which the dates 1894 and 1897 are
written in pencil, and the name Mills is inscribed into the surface.
The name is about 4 inches long and 1{ inches tall.''
   The name may have been carved by William Mills of Tennessee, who
was among the 189 men known to have died March 6, 1836, defending
the Alamo in the struggle for Texas independence.
   ``We don't have any solid proof it was William Mills, but it's a
good possibility,'' Beck said.
   Beck and stone mason Baltazar Espinosa discovered the graffiti as
they worked on the north side of the Shrine of Texas Liberty as part
of an ongoing preservation project. The door dates to the early
1700s, Beck said.

   Oil prices slide. 
Real estate goes bust. 
Banks collapse. 
The Dallas Cowboys notch their first losing season in two decades. 

   Texans have seen plenty of woes in recent years. 
Now, to top it all off, even the value of their printed paper is plunging. 
And not just any paper, but Texas's proudest heritage, including certain copies of its own 1836 Declaration of Independence from Mexico, which sold for up to $30,000. 

   A number of them have turned out to be phonies. 
Someone -- no one knows who -- has been "diddling around with the stuff of Texas history," says an angry Don Carleton, director of the Barker Texas History Center at the University of Texas. 

   And they've been doing so for the past 15 years, according to Austin-based publisher and rare-book dealer W. Thomas Taylor, who alerted Texas booksellers to the problem earlier this month. 
Mr. Taylor himself unwittingly sold several of the phony documents. 

   The duped also include such patriotic Texas bigwigs as Gov. William Clements, as well as numerous libraries and universities, including the Barker Center. 
It owns a fake copy of a particularly sacred Texas text, Col. William Barrett Travis's "Victory or Death" letter, penned just as the Mexican forces closed in on the Alamo. 

   All of the forgeries purport to be general-distribution circulars printed in the 1830s and '40s, during the Republic of Texas era. 
But the typefaces used, says Mr. Taylor, weren't invented until decades later. 
Aside from that big gaffe, the fastidious forgers dotted some i's that went undotted in the originals. 
Mr. Taylor figures a total of about 100 false documents are in circulation, and embarassed booksellers around the state are apologetically returning their customers' money. 

   But not all Texas tycoons were taken in. 
A while back, H. Ross Perot was offered a Travis circular. 
Experts at Yale University, which has a verified Travis letter, were skeptical, and Mr. Perot passed. 

   Still, that hasn't stopped others from offering him a supposed original U.S. Declaration of Independence and the sword General Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington. 
Says Mr. Perot: "There are days when I think people must believe I'm the biggest patsy around."

   Today is Thursday, Feb. 23, the 54th day of 1989. There are 311
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Feb. 23, 1945, during World War II, U.S. Marines on Iwo Jima
raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi in a scene captured on
film by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal.
   On this date:
   In 1685, composer George Frideric Handel was born in Germany.
   In 1822, Boston was granted a charter to incorporate as a city.
   In 1836, the siege of the Alamo began in San Antonio, Texas.
   In 1847, U.S. troops under Gen. Zachary Taylor defeated Mexican
Gen. Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista in Mexico.
   In 1848, John Quincy Adams, sixth president of the United States,
died of a stroke at age 80.
   In 1861, President-elect Abraham Lincoln arrived secretly in
Washington to take office, an assassination plot having been foiled
in Baltimore.
   In 1870, Mississippi was readmitted to the union.
   In 1905, the Rotary Club was founded.
   In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge signed a bill creating the
Federal Radio Commission, forerunner of the Federal Communications
Commission.
   In 1942, a Japanese submarine fired on an oil refinery in
Ellwood, Calif.
   In 1954, the first mass inoculation of children against polio
using the Salk vaccine began in Pittsburgh.
   In 1978, William H. Webster was sworn in to a 10-year term as
director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Webster left the
post to become director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987.
   Ten years ago: The Labor Department reported that consumer prices
rose by a seasonally adjusted nine-tenths of 1 percent the previous
month, with much of the rise attributed to higher prices for food,
medical care and gasoline.
   Five years ago: In Fall River, Mass., the prosecution began
presenting its case in the trial of four men charged with the gang
rape of a young woman at Big Dan's, a bar in nearby New Bedford. A
separate trial was also being held for two other defendants.
   One year ago: President Reagan named William L. Ball III to be
his new Navy Secretary, succeeding James H. Webb Jr., who had
resigned over budget cutbacks.
   Today's birthdays: Author-journalist William L. Shirer is 85.
Actor Peter Fonda is 50.
   Thought for today: ``It is the individual who is not interested
in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and
provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such
individuals that all human failures spring.'' _ Alfred Adler,
Austrian psychoanalyst (1870-1937).

<HEAD>JAMES MICHENER: His Secret Is Routine</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK KEEVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Routine is James Michener's secret. But the
results are hardly routine.
   Despite quintuple bypass heart surgery, a new left hip,
extensive dental work and an attack of permanent vertigo, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist still produces massive tomes at the
age of 83, 10 books altogether in the last four years.
   His fans, in awe of his output, wonder how he does it. With the
September publication of his latest work, they'll find out.
   In a lengthy prologue to ``The Eagle and the Raven,'' Michener
says the work may appear to be ``an almost indecent display of
frenzied industry but it was carried out slowly, carefully, each
morning at the typewriter, each afternoon filled with exciting
research and reflection.''
   Light exercise and diet, a nap and classical music are part of
each day for this prolific writer, who says he could not possibly
remain idle.
   ``I have had a burst of energy I could never have anticipated,
not only to write more books but particularly to leave a picture of
a professional writer at work,'' Michener said.
   Michener divides his time among Austin, where he teaches writing
at the University of Texas; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Brunswick,
Maine.
   Deborah Brothers, co-owner of State House Press of Austin, which
is publishing the book, said the prologue answers many questions
reader ask about Michener's life.
   ``Curiously, during this spurt of energy I have never thought of
myself as either compulsive or driven _ nor was I,'' Michener said.
``Through decades of writing I have acquired certain patterns of
behavior and workmanship which had enabled me to write long books.
   ``I merely adhere to those solid rules. I rise each day at 7:30,
wash my face in cold water but do not shave, eat a frugal breakfast
of bran sprinkled with banana, raisins and skim milk, no sugar, and
go directly to my desk, where the day's work has been laid out the
night before.
   ``With delight and a feeling of well-being, I leap into whatever
task awaits and remain at it until half after noon, when I have a
light lunch after which I take a nap. I never type in the afternoon
but do meet classes at the university.
   ``At dusk each day, regardless of the weather, I take a mile
walk at a rather brisk clip. Supper, the evening news, a nine
o'clock movie if a good one is available on television, a half-hour
of cleaning my desk at 11 and off to bed.''
   Also, he said, ``Each day without fail, I find time to listen to
classical music on my new compact disc player,'' including Chopin,
Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, Brahms, Bartok, Stravinsky and operatic
arias.
   ``I never play the music while I work at original composition
but often listen to it when doing routine work like checking
pagination, reading stacks of accumulated mail or filing research
material. The long walks, the sensible diet and the music keep me
healthy and able to complete the work,'' Michener said.
   One nagging question remains. ``Was I . . . apprehensive of
work-ending death? And . . . did I labor so diligently because of
my age and the approach of a time when I could work no more?
   ``I think not. I write at 83 for the same reasons that impelled
me to write at 43: I was born with a passionate desire to
communicate, to organize experience, to tell tales that dramatize
the adventures which listeners might have had,'' Michener said.
   ``The job of a storyteller is to tell stories, and I have
concentrated on that obligation.''
   The storytelling in ``The Eagle and the Raven'' comes in a
modified, expanded version of a lengthy chapter pulled from
``Texas,'' published in 1986.
   It follows the lives of generals Santa Anna of Mexico and Sam
Houston of Texas. Their brief encounter in 1836 at the Battle of
San Jacinto, which enabled Texas to win its independence from
Mexico, is considered by many historians to be one of the decisive
battles of the world.

<LEADPARA>  NOT surprisingly, between the Persian Gulf War and the sluggish economy, many
families are vacationing closer to home this year instead of taking a trip
abroad. But the fact is, lots of Americans look forward to a little foreign
spice in their holidays. The big question: Can they find it on this side of
the Atlantic and the Pacific?;    Glad you asked. We've come up with 10 U.S.,
Canadian and Mexican destinations that have a distinctly exotic flavor. So
close, and yet so far -- that's the idea.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  INTERNATIONAL APPEAL WITHOUT CROSSING AN

<MEMO>  Destination: North America
Scripps Howard News Service contributed to this story.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To qualify for the list, each of the 10 places had to possess broad appeal
as a vacation site. Each had to be different from almost anywhere else in the
United States and Canada.;    In addition, if flying worries you, all these
destinations can be reached by car, except Southeastern Alaska, which is
served by ferry and cruise ships. For a vacation with international flair but
no transoceanic flights, consider:;     Quebec City;  The local folks speak
French, which gives Quebec City a distinctly foreign flavor. The food is very
much French-influenced, right down to the ubiquitous loaves of French bread.
And, happily, it looks like a French city. It was France's first settlement in
North America.;    It is a walled city, which strongly reinforces the
impression you are in Europe, and the restored 17th- and 18th-century stone
buildings in the old section duplicate the architecture of a French provincial
town. Cobblestone squares, narrow streets, the castle-like Chateau Frontenac
hotel and a profusion of sidewalk cafes complete the picture.;    Information:
Quebec Government Office of Tourism, (800) 443-7000.;     San Antonio; 
Founded by Spanish missionaries arriving from Mexico, San Antonio retains many
of the features of Spanish colonial architecture -- red-tiled roofs, adobe
walls and shady courtyards -- found in 17th- and 18th-century towns south of
the border. The famed Alamo was a Spanish mission, and four other old missions
in the city are preserved as San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.;  
 San Antonio's Spanish colonial heritage is authentic, but the city also has
created a Mexican fantasyland called the Paseo del Rio, a beautiful promenade
along the San Antonio River. Stone stairways, arched bridges, banana trees,
outdoor cafes, sidewalk musicians and a profusion of twinkling lights are the
romantic setting for a nightly Mexican-flavored fiesta.;    Information: San
Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau, 317 Alamo St., San Antonio, Texas

awesome scenery and rugged outdoor challenges that are a big part of the
appeal of the Alps. But only Colorado has all of this and Aspen, a chic
mountain village that is as fashionable as any Alpine retreat -- in summer as
well as winter.;    Sure, you can visit Aspen on a modest budget, but there's
probably no other North American resort where you also can splurge as
indulgently on luxury hotels, fine cuisine and expensive souvenirs. In
appearance, Aspen is as tastefully attractive in Old West garb as the more
formal grand resorts of the Alps. And the mountain vistas are as spectacular.
In summer, the resort plays host to a major festival of classical music.;

resemble Europe's frozen northland. But similarities are strong in summer,
too. Minneapolis is a modern city with avant-garde flair while St. Paul is
more Old World in style. Together, they reflect the old and new of the cities
of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Both are sparkling clean, and the
sidewalks seem filled with tall, lanky, blond people.;    But what really
gives the Twin Cities a Scandinavian look is their river setting amid pine
forests and lakes. Though far from the ocean, they are nevertheless waterside
cities. Within Minneapolis itself are several large lakes, which residents
make good use of in the summer for swimming and boating.;     Information:

it to the Caribbean, then Miami and the Florida Keys might do nicely instead.
Miami's beaches are good, the city's vegetation is lush and -- for better or
worse -- the summer climate is as sultry as it is on any Caribbean island.;   
The city's large Cuban population has given Miami a Latin flavor, which is
reflected in interesting dishes on many menus. Spanish is spoken widely, both
by Cuban residents and hordes of South Americans who flock to the city for the
bright lights and good times. Venture down into the Keys, and you find
excellent Caribbean-style resorts such as Hawk's Cay on Duck Key at Mile
Marker 61.;     Information: Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, 701
Brickell Ave., Suite 2700, Miami, Fla. 33131, (305) 539-3000.;     Victoria,
B.C.;  Victoria draws tourists by the ferry-loads, in large part because it
manages to live up to most preconceptions of what a proper English town should
look like. It is wonderfully quaint, which it manages to achieve by hanging
pots of blooming flowers off every imaginable pillar and post.;    Much of the
architecture is Tudor or Victorian, and the city is filled with the sort of
broad green parks and well-tended gardens that make London so appealing. The
waterfront bustles, which adds a proper British seagoing element to the
ambiance. Dominating the harbor is another castle-like hotel, the monumental
Empress, which each afternoon serves high tea to those fortunate to find a
free table.;     Information: Tourism British Columbia, Parliament Building,
Victoria, B.C. V8V 1X4, Canada; (800) 663-6000.;     Los Cabos;  Not much more
than empty beaches and barren desert a few years ago, the Mexican government
is planning for a resort more controlled than Cancun.;    Visitors will find
two sides to Los Cabos: San Jose del Cabo, a charming, more-authentically
Mexican town, and Cabo San Lucas with its nightlife.;    This is the ends of
the Earth, literally. Los Cabos is at the tip of land's end on the
1,000-mile-long Baja California peninsula, where the Pacific Ocean meets the
Sea of Cortez.;    Big plans for resorts and golf courses are on drawing
boards with target dates of 2000 or before. If you go now, you'll see
something more original.;    If you want peace and quiet, there's a lagoon and
estuary with more than 200 species of birds next to the Stouffer Presidente
Hotel. If you want noise, check out the hottest nightspot in town, the Cabo
Wabo Cantina, owned by the rock group Van Halen.;     Information: Mexican

(213) 203-9335.;     Nova Scotia;  The Scottish were among several
nationalities who settled the rugged, wind-swept peninsula jutting into the
Atlantic. For them, the dramatic seascapes, now dotted with fishing villages,
and the highlands and forests reminded them of home. As in Scotland, much of
Nova Scotia remains remote and wild.;     Information: Nova Scotia Tourism and

Southeastern Alaska;  In truth, some of our North American substitutes are
only shadows of the real thing. But the Inside Passage to Alaska is fully as
spectacular -- if not more so -- than a cruise of Norway's legendary fiords.

snow-capped mountains, rocky ridges and dense forests broken by occasional
villages.;     Information: Alaska Division of Tourism, P.O. Box E, Juneau,
Alaska 99811; (907) 465-2010.;     New Orleans;  New Orleans is a mix of many
influences. In the city's famed French Quarter, street names are in French
while several of the most historic buildings are Spanish in origin. They give
New Orleans a European look, but the city's steamy summer weather is
definitely tropical. While touring the French Quarter's narrow, balcony-shaded
streets, picture yourself, perhaps, in a raffish Mediterranean port where the
pace is slow and good times are appreciated. If you are looking for fun, New
Orleans welcomes visitors nightly with a friendly open-air party on Bourbon
Street.;    -- Information: Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention

<HL> Utility Holds Talks On Buying System In San Antonio </HL>
<AUTHOR> Dianna Solis (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<IN> UTI TNM NUK </IN>
<TEXT>
   Central &amp; South West Corp., a utility holding company, said it has held "exploratory talks" with the city of San Antonio, Texas, regarding purchasing the municipal electric system. 

   "Our discussion was only preliminary and philosophical and no negotiation regarding price or terms occurred" with San Antonio, the nation's 10th-largest city, said Merle Borchelt, chairman and chief executive officer of the Dallas-based holding company. 

   Central &amp; South West, which serves 1.5 million customers in four states, has indicated repeatedly that it is interested in acquiring a fifth utility. 
Its dominant unit, Central Power &amp; Light Co., owns a 25.2% stake in the $5.3 billion South Texas nuclear project. 
City Public Service of San Antonio owns a 28% stake in the same nuclear plant. 

   If a merger were to take place, the combined stake of 53.2% would give the Central &amp; South West unit the majority interest in the nuclear project and make the parent company the largest electricity provider in Texas. 

   The city of Austin holds a 16% stake in the South Texas Project, 90 miles south of Houston. 
Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co., a utility unit of Houston Industries Inc., is the managing partner with a 30.8% stake in the two-unit nuclear project. 
The three other partners have been in yet unresolved litigation with Houston Lighting &amp; Power for several years over cost overruns and alleged mismanagement of the project. 

   In 1987, Central &amp; South West had net income of $372 million, or $3.92 a share, on revenue of $2.4 billion. 
Mr. Borchelt said the possible purchase of City Public Service of San Antonio would require extensive negotiations and approvals by regulatory agencies. 
San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros met with Mr. Borchelt this week regarding the possible purchase, a Central &amp; South West spokesman said. 

   Mr. Cisneros couldn't be reached for comment on the terse announcement made late last night by the Dallas company. 
A City Public Service spokeswoman shed no light on the talks. 

   San Antonio, a city of about one million people, is best known for its military past and present. 
Its economy remains fueled by both facts. 
Helping to fill city coffers are its military complexes and tourism, much of the latter centered on the Alamo mission, where the U.S. was defeated by Mexico when Texas was still part of that nation. 
The city, 150 miles north of the Mexican border, also has a fledgling biotechnology industry. 

   City Public Service serves about 500,000 customers in Bexar County, where San Antonio is, and seven adjoining counties. 
Bexar, the nation's 10th fastest-growing county, has considerable electric needs. 
The city's peak demand this summer was 2,663 megawatts while it currently has an electrical capacity of 3,200,000 kilowatts.

   Davy Crockett is more than the ``king
of the wild frontier'' to his descendants, who are meeting at a
state park that bears his name.
   ``David was quite a man in his time,'' said Joy Bland of Paris,
Tenn., a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of the Tennessee
pioneer. ``We think he made quite a contribution to our state in
many ways.''
   More than 100 people who have traced their roots to Crockett
began gathering at David Crockett State Park near here Thursday.
The reunion coincides with David Crockett Days, an annual festival.
   ``We want to keep the knowledge of him alive,'' Ms. Bland said.
``I learn something different every reunion.''
   To be a full member of the four-year-old Descendants of David
Crockett organization, people must trace their lineage to one of
Crockett's six children, two stepchildren or two wives. Those who
are simply interested in Crockett can join as associate members.
   The man who historians say called himself David, not Davy,
Crockett was born in northeast Tennessee on Aug. 17, 1786. He
represented the region as a state lawmaker and then was a
congressman in 1827-31 and 1833-35. He died in Texas defending the
Alamo in 1836.
   Ms. Bland said Crockett's record of public service often becomes
lost in the folklore surrounding him, but the frontiersman is
partly to blame.
   ``He liked to hunt, and he liked to talk about it,'' Ms. Bland
said. ``He only shot big bears.''
   Walt Disney Studios recently announced plans for a new
television series about Crockett. In the '50s, the orignal Disney
series starring Fess Parker had every kid in America wanting to
dress in coonskin.
   ``I really hope they will try to teach the public something
about the man that he was,'' said Ms. Bland. ``If children have
heroes today, it ought to be someone like him.''

   The largest house on Long Island
has been sold for $22 million, or a bargain $170,000 for each of
its 130 rooms, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Developer Gary Melius sold the Otto Kahn Mansion two weeks ago
to an unidentified Japanese businessman, according to Newsday.
   Melius confirmed the sale but told Newsday he had signed a
non-disclosure clause. The newspaper said it learned the selling
price from a source close to the deal.
   Melius, who bought the house in 1984 for $1.5 million and spent
millions more restoring it, said he was selling it at the request
of his wife, dropping plans to turn it into condos, a tennis club
or health spa.
   ``It was too much money and too much time,'' he said. ``It was
consuming us.''
   The mansion, built on 443 acres overlooking Cold Spring Harbor,
was dubbed Oheka by its first owner, Otto Herman Kahn. It was
second largest house in the nation at the time of construction.
   The home was sold in 1938 to the New York City Sanitation
Department as a weekend retreat for employees. It was a government
training center during World War II and later was a private
military academy.
   Melius' original asking price was $52 million with complete
renovations. He estimated that there was still $8 million to $15
million worth of restoration work still to be done.

<HEAD>Huge Pole, Flag Raising Ruckus</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON-ON-THE-BRAZOS, Texas (AP) _ A question of crass
versus class has Texans feuding over whether to hoist a flag and
pole 13 stories high at the spot where the state's forefathers
declared independence from Mexico in 1836.
   The 325-foot flagpole would fly a Texas flag one-eighth the size
of a football field over a local park. The flagpole, which
purportedly would be the world's largest, would be about 245 feet
shorter than the San Jacinto Monument near Houston, The Dallas
Morning News reported.
   Edward Smith, a banker from nearby Brenham, wants to donate the
flag and pole. ``Anyone that finds the Texas flag crass and
tasteless sure isn't much of a Texan,'' Smith said at last week's
public hearing on the flagpole proposal.
   Historical purists say the pole and flag would destroy the
dignity of ``the Philadelphia of Texas'' and create a carnival
atmosphere at the park.
   ``Somehow the giant pole strikes me as more appropriate for Six
Flags or AstroWorld,'' Texas A&amp;M University professor Don Ivey said
in a reference to theme parks at the spirited hearing.
   Gus Sanders, a businessman from nearby Chappell Hill, also said
he was opposed to the giant banner and pole.
   ``You Texans,'' said the Louisiana native, ``certainly don't
need to raise your flag any higher.''
   But some residents of this hamlet of Washington, which surrounds
the scenic park that runs to the banks of the Brazos River, say the
flagpole is a banner idea.
   In the hearing conducted by the Parks and Wildlife Department,
Mrs. Arthur Bushrer said the flagpole would be a boon to the
tourist industry and added she was not bothered by claims it would
reinforce the image of Texans being ``insufferable braggarts.''
   ``Everything about Texas is big,'' she said. ```Big as Texas'
used to be something we were proud of. We had big hats, big cars,
big people. We were big in heart and big in pride.''
   Hal Moorman, president of Washington-on-the-Brazos State Park
Association, argued that because of the state's fiscal situation,
the donated flag may not be replaced when it wears out.
   Parks and Wildlife Department staff will make a recommendation
to the agency's nine commissioners, who are expected to deliver a
decision May 12.
   Smith refuses to reveal the cost of the pole and flag, but park
officials estimated they cost at least $100,000.
   The record tallest flagpole _ 299 feet, 7 inches _ was raised in
San Francisco during an international exposition in 1915, according
to the ``Guinness Book of World Records.''
   If the flag isn't raised at the park, Aggie professor Ivey has
another suggestion.
   ``Place it,'' he said referring to the arch football rival
several hundred miles to the north, ``on an island in Lake Texoma
where it would be visible from the University of Oklahoma.''

<TEXT>     I really dig those styles they wear. . . .;   Yes, this is a land of rich
diversity, from the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan all the way to the
towering mounds of garbage piled up next to the towering skyscrapers of
Manhattan, and you owe it to yourself, as an American, to see it all. Why go
to Europe, with its high prices and strange food and incomprehensible lingoes,
when, with just a little effort, you can find these things right here?;  
Alabama; Often called "The Pancreas of Dixie," Alabama offers a tremendous
amount of culture as well as turnips. The State Flower is the camellia; the
State Dog is named "Booger" and you should not wake him up. Montgomery, Ala.,
was the first capital of the confederacy and in 1861 was the site of the
inauguration of legendary Civil War coach Paul "Bear" Bryant. Many other
fascinating historic and cultural events have also occurred in this dynamic
state. Ask around.;   Alaska; Despite being close to Alabama in the
encyclopedia, Alaska is actually located in Canada. This is only one of the
astounding facts about this dynamic state, which is so big that if you were to
walk across it at the rate of 25 miles per day, you would get moose poop all
over your shoes. You find moose poop everywhere in Alaska. You can buy
souvenirs made from it. We once bought (this is true) some moose-poop swizzle
sticks in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, where our hotel had a huge stuffed
bear in the lobby striking a pose that said: "Welcome to Alaska! I am going to
rip your face off!" Alaska also contains large quantities of nature in the
form of tundra ("tundra" is the Eskimo word for "nothing") and glaciers, which
are enormous pieces of ice that have somehow developed the ability to creep
around, which is a pretty scary concept and we just hope they don't learn to
walk erect. The Official State Motto of Alaska is: "Brrrrrrr!" The Official
State Bird is covered with oil.;   California; The nation's most populous
state, California truly lives up to its dynamic nickname, "The Nation's Most
Populous State," with enough uniformed parking valets in Los Angeles alone to
conquer Eastern Europe. Southern California also boasts more than 57 billion
convenient miles of freeway and many fascinating places to visit, although we
frankly have no idea which exit you take to get to them. But you should
definitely try to find Universal Studios, where you can get a
"behind-the-scenes" look at an actual working amusement park, including a
terrifying ride where, in the climactic finale, you are attacked by a
realistic 14-ton animated replica of Zsa Zsa Gabor.;   Visitors to Northern
California will definitely want to visit Wine Country, where they can snork
down a couple dozen free samples and then go experience the dry heaves amid
the awesome towering grandeur of the giant redwoods, which are the oldest
living things on Earth that are not members of the Grateful Dead. And of
course no trip to Northern California would be complete without a visit to San
Francisco, whose romantic charm inspired the immortal Tony Bennett song "Don't
Mess With My Toot Toot." Be sure to join several tons of carbohydrate-bloated
tourists for a ride on a quaint cable car, lurching up and down quaint "hills"
that are actually 800-foot vertical drops, as the cable-car driver dings the
quaint little bell, sending out the cheerful message "ding-a-ding-ding," which
is code for: "Look out, my cable is badly frayed.";   California's State
Blender Setting is puree.;   Colorado; Besides being dynamic, Colorado is
best-known for the breathtaking beauty of the Rocky Mountains, which are still
visible in some areas peeking out from under a dense protective layer of
condominium units. It's no wonder that each year millions of skiers come to
experience the state's superb emergency medical facilities. Colorado is also
rich in minerals, but so what? is our feeling. The capital and largest city is
Denver, which needless to say boasts museums, symphonies, etc. You have
probably noticed that virtually all cities, including some real armpits, like
to boast that they have museums and symphonies, which are of course the last
things that you really want at the end of a hard day of traveling. What you
want is a motel room that doesn't have hairs on the sheets. The Colorado State
Garnish is parsley.;   Florida; This happens to be our place of residence, and
we are not just "tooting our own horn" when we say that no other state offers
as many dynamic opportunities to encounter gigantic insects. We have
cockroaches here that, instead of scuttling under a counter when you flick on
the kitchen light, will pick up your entire refrigerator and lumber from the
room. Also in the nature department we have the Everglades, an extremely
fascinating natural swamp that inevitably causes the first-time visitor to
exclaim: "Huh." The major state industries are tourism, bingo, obtaining
senior-citizen discounts and not having automobile insurance. The state
capital is Epcot Center. The largest city is Miami (official tourism slogan:
"Maybe You Won't Get Shot"), a richly diverse cosmopolitan metropolis where
people from many different cultures live and work together while continuing to
observe the traffic laws of their individual countries of origin. The Florida
State Seal depicts a mosquito carrying a machine gun.;   Maryland; Maryland is
a fast-growing state boasting a dynamic economy based on giving speeding
tickets to people attempting to drive through. One of Maryland's major
attractions is the Chesapeake Bay, a crab-intensive body of water that gets
its name from the Indian word "Cesapiq," which means "Chesapeake." Maryland
also contains Baltimore, site of the historic Fort McHenry, where in 1812
Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner" to express the joy he felt
after watching the Orioles defeat the Yankees in a critical American League
East game. Maryland also boasts the nation's first umbrella factory. Sometimes
Maryland gets positively obnoxious boasting about this. You'll go to a bar
where states hang out, and there will be Maryland, after about six shots of
Wild Turkey, shouting, "Oh, YEAH? Well, you wanna know who had the FIRST
UMBRELLA FACTORY? Huh? LISTEN TO ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!" The Official
State Sport of Maryland -- we swear we are not making this one up, and we urge
you to look it up if you don't believe us -- is jousting.;   Nevada; Let's get
one thing straight: There is more to Nevada than Las Vegas. There is also the
part that you have to drive through to get to Las Vegas. Fortunately you can
do this at upwards of 130 miles per hour, because there is no speed limit in
Nevada. Even murder is legal, but it rarely happens because people get
distracted. A guy will be on his way to kill somebody, and he'll pass a slot
machine, and he'll figure, what the heck, so he'll put in a quarter, and
pretty soon he's broke and has to pawn his gun to get more quarters. The
result is that Nevada has a very dynamic economy, with gambling being the No.
1 industry, followed closely by blood donorship. Las Vegas is also a cultural
center, featuring extravagant theatrical productions in which world-class
performers express the artistic concept: "Get a load of these hooters." And
definitely do not miss the Liberace Museum, which presents a fascinating
piano-oriented view of history. One plaque reads: "With Abraham Lincoln as
president, the Civil War was raging when the Steinway Co. of New York created
this fine piano made of solid rosewood." We can just imagine the scene at the
Steinway Co. that fateful day: The board of directors is seated around the
conference table, grim-faced, and the chairman says: "Gentlemen, Abraham
Lincoln is president, and the Civil War is raging! We must make a fine piano
of solid rosewood!";   Nevada is also a mecca for lovers of fine concrete, who
will want to visit the Hoover Dam, which was completed in 1936 and resulted in
the formation of the Grand Canyon. There is a guided tour of the dam, which
your children will surely want to take 17 or 18 consecutive times while you go
back to Vegas and shoot some craps.;   Texas; Texas used to be the largest
state, but because of Alaska, it no longer is. Texans are still very touchy
about this, so you should be sensitive when you discuss it with them. "What a
large state this is, despite being nowhere near as large as Alaska!" is a
sensitive remark you might want to make. Although today Texas is modern and of
course dynamic, it is proud of its cowboy tradition, which can still be seen
in the form of men wearing comical hats. One of the most important historical
attractions is the Alamo, the famous San Antonio mission where, in 1836, a
small, brave band of Texans formed the nation's first car-rental franchise,
which can still be seen today. Visitors are also welcome to the Lyndon B.
Johnson Library, but they avoid it anyway. Texas also contains many scenic
hills and rivers, although nothing like what you see in Alaska (which is much
larger than Texas). The Official State Symptom is irregularity.;   Washington,
D.C.; As an American, you owe it to yourself to visit the nation's capital,
because this is your city, where your government spends trillions of your
dollars on dynamic programs such as National Intestinal Blockage Month,
administered by your government workers in buildings that you can't go into
because you don't have a pass. But you can visit many inspirational tourist
sites, including the Richard M. Nixon Monument (currently missing) and the
Tomb of the Unknown Internal Revenue Service Employee Who Is Supposed To
Answer The Taxpayer Assistance Hot Line. You may also visit the White House
any time, day or night, simply by pounding on the front gate and shouting
vague, irrational threats. Another popular Washington stop is the Supreme
Court, where the justices frequently ask the spectators to help them decide a
tough case by registering their opinions on the Applause-O-Meter. And be sure
to visit your congressperson's office, where you are welcome to take some
souvenir furniture. Your congressperson probably won't notice. Your
congressperson is probably in Paris.;   Next: Air Travel (Or: Why Birds Never
Look Truly Relaxed).  </TEXT>

   John Tower made an extraordinary public

   In an appearance at the National Press Club, Tower also said he
regards his weekend oath to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as
``sacred...and I can assure you I will abide by it.''
   Tower fielded questions about his confirmation ordeal as Vice
President Dan Quayle conceded the Bush admininistration is currently
short of the votes needed to ratify the appointment, and as Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell announced his opposition.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush was continuing to lobby senators personally in search of
additional votes.
   Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, Tower, twice
divorced and now single, said, ``As a matter of fact, I have broken
wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.''
   Tower's second wife, Lilla, alleged ``marital misconduct'' in
court filings in the couple's divorce case.
   Tower's appearance marked the latest turn in the struggle by the
Bush administration _ as well as the former Texas senator _ to
salvage the nomination against solid Democratic opposition in the
Senate.
   Tower has been struggling against concerns about his drinking
habits, allegations of womanizing and questions over possible
conflicts of interest stemming from his employment as a defense
industry consultant.
   In his remarks, Tower also turned aside a question of whether his
appointment was a political payoff for having headed a commission
that gave Bush a clean bill of health in the Iran-Contra scandal of
the Reagan administration. He said congressional investigators also
found nothing to implicate Bush, and said, ``I wonder what kind of
payoff they're going to get.''
   Tower showed flashes of humor and grit by turn at the press club
rostrum.
   Asked how he felt about his predicament, he said ``a little bit
like the fellow who was immersed in tar and feathers and was being
ridden out of town on a rail. He said, really gentlemen if it were
not for the honor I'd rather hitchhike.''
   Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn from
nomination, he replied by quoting from the last letter written by
Lt. Col. William Barrett Travis, whom he identified as the leader of
the Texans who fought and died at the Alamo: ``I shall never
surrender or retreat.''
   Tower paused briefly and said, ``I am a little sorry I brought up
the Alamo analogy. It just occurred to me what happened at the Alamo
just 10 days after Travis wrote that letter.'' Texas defenders were
wiped out by Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's forces.
   Asked what had angered him most about his confirmation fight, he
said there were no clearly defined standards against which he was
being judged. He noted that several senators have said that the
secretary of defense, as the commander of U.S. military forces
behind only the president, must adhere to a higher standard. ``I
accept that...but my question is how much,'' he said.
   He then asked whether it is ``acceptable for members late in the
evening who had a few drinks in hideaways...to come onto the floor
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear
deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and
paid vacations ``from special interests who have a vested interest
in the legislative process.''
   There was no letup in the political storm surrounding the
nomination, as Fitzwater charged Democrats with turning the
appointment into a partisan struggle.
   The spokesman claimed some senators are ``starting to have second
thoughts about the words they used'' to describe Tower.
   Quayle claimed progress for the administration lobbying campaign,
as well.
   ``We don't have 50 votes yet. But we're moving in that direction,
and I'll be the 51st,'' he said, referring to his ability to cast a
tie-breaking vote in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 55-45
advantage.
   Key Republicans said they would meet later in the day to decide
whether to seek a delay in the beginning of the debate on the
nomination, which has drawn widespread opposition from Democrats.
   Tower has been battling questions about his drinking habits,
allegations of womanizing and concerns about his acceptance of
thousands of dollars in defense consultants' fees, and Mitchell
addressed those issues in his speech ion the Senate.
   The Maine Democrat said he was troubled by Tower's work as a
defense consultant. ``He received payment while it was widely
assumed that he might be a nominee for defense secretary if
President Bush were elected,'' the Democratic leader said.
   Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct,
Mitchell said ``it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of
senators that are at issue here.''
   ``Public officials have a right to a private life,'' he said.
``They do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which
could interfere with the discharge of their public duties.''
   ``A single lapse in judgment _ or perhaps even a few _ should not
disqualify an individual from public service,'' Mitchell continued.
   ``But when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many
incidents spanning many years, and when there is insufficient
evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken, then there
are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses
the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the
secretary of defense.''
   Mitchell's position was widely anticipated, particularly since
all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have
opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it.
   But at the same time, the Democratic leader said he hoped the
Tower struggle would not have ``an adverse impact on relations''
between the Democratic majority in the Senate and the administration.
   ``I do not believe any senator's decision should be based upon
partisan considerations,'' he said. ``This is a personal decision
for each senator to make...''
   Quayle made his comments during a photo session with Guatemalan
President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Asked if Tower's nomination could still be salvaged, he said, ``I
think so. I hope so.''
   He said he was not worried about Pentagon operations, saying,
``The Pentagon is ongoing right now'' under acting Secretary William
H. Taft IV.
   ``There will not be any interruption until we get a new secretary
of defense,'' Quayle said.
   The White House vowed to fight on in Tower's behalf, and
Fitzwater said Bush would be meeting with ``one or two senators'' on
the question today.
   ``We're still hopeful. We're still going to keep working it ...
We'll just keep up the good fight and see how it goes,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The debate over Tower has become increasingly partisan in recent
days. Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, after a meeting with Bush
at the White House on Tuesday night, said the opposition ``is an
affront to the president of the United States who was elected last
November to make these nominations.''

<HL> Law: Bank Mergers May Be Complicated By Issue of Liability in Alamo Case </HL>
<AUTHOR> Wayne E. Green (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> BNK TNM </IN>
<G> JUS </G>
<TEXT>
   Some acquisition-minded banks could get a major new worry if the government wins a little-noticed federal court battle it's waging with a tiny bank in South Texas. 

   They could be held responsible for criminal acts they didn't commit and may not have known about. 

   In bank mergers, an acquiring institution often assumes the civil liabilities of a bank it absorbs -- everything from debts to lawsuits to creditor claims. 
But in a Justice Department case involving a bank's alleged failure to report drug-related currency deposits, the government is arguing that liability for criminal violations also must be assumed by an acquiring bank, in this instance Alamo Bank of Texas. 

   "This is a case of first impression," says Charles Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney in Houston who is prosecuting the case. 
"It's an important legal issue for the banking industry and for financial law enforcement." 

   Indeed, attorneys say that if the department's position is upheld, it would seriously complicate the bank merger process. 
Ferreting out contingent criminal liabilities isn't always easy, some note, because criminal investigations are usually private. 
And unless the contingent liability is somehow provided for in a merger agreement, it could leave a bank open to expensive litigation and potentially large fines. 

   "It could be mind boggling," asserts Thomas G. Sharpe Jr., a Brownsville, Texas, attorney and general counsel of Alamo Bank of Texas. 

   At the core of the government's case is the alleged failure of Central National Bank of Pharr, Texas, to report sizable currency transactions in 1983 and 1984, as required by federal law. 
The Justice Department says those transactions included deposits totaling $2.6 million that were made by several drug dealers it was investigating and later prosecuted. 

   The Pharr bank was acquired in April 1987 by Alamo Bank in Alamo, Texas, a town of about 4,300 people in the Rio Grande Valley near the Texas-Mexico border, only a few miles from Pharr. 
Alamo says it knew about the reporting failures, but didn't have anything to do with them and was under the impression that the government wasn't going to press charges against Central National. 

   But last December, a federal grand jury indicted not only Central National on charges of failing to report the transactions, but also Alamo. 
It said Alamo, with assets of about $75 million, is responsible as a "successor in interest" to the Pharr bank. 
Alamo eventually pleaded no contest to charges that the currency transactions weren't reported. 
In Brownsville last week, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela fined Alamo $750,000, which the bank says is more than its annual profit. 
It suspended $500,000 of the fine and put the bank on three years probation. 

   The case turns largely on how the language of Texas and federal statutes governing bank mergers should be interpreted. 
Both provide that where a national and state bank are merged, the consolidated entity assumes "all" liabilities of the merged banks. 
Such laws generally have been viewed as a way to prevent banks from using sham mergers to evade creditor claims. 

   As Alamo sees it, these are civil statutes that say nothing about criminal liability and weren't intended to cover it. 
And banking attorneys say they're unaware of cases in which such laws have been extended to reach criminal violations. 

   "I just don't think it's been done before," says Bruce LaBoon, a banking lawyer in the Houston firm of Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill &amp; LaBoon. 
He notes that criminal laws generally require a showing that a defendant has disregarded or intentionally violated the law. 
And that's difficult to demonstrate if you're trying to hold a bank responsibile for violations it didn't commit, he says. 

   But the Justice Department says that when banking laws require banks to assume "all" liabilities they mean just that -- all liabilities, including criminal. 
"The language of these statutes is direct and unequivocal," the government argues in papers filed with the Brownsville court. 
And Mr. Lewis says the issue is crucial because Texas is "awash in drug money" and bank mergers are increasing. 

   Alamo says it will ask the federal appeals court in New Orleans to resolve the question. 
"I think the implications reach way beyond our little bank here," says Allen Shields, president of Alamo Bank.

   Q. Senator, you've taken a beating in the press. Embarrassing
stories have been written about your personal life. What are your
feelings about this?
   A. Well, I can't say _ well, I guess I should say I feel a little
bit like the fellow that was _ had been immersed in tar and feathers
and was being ridden out of town on a rail.
   And, he said, ``Really, gentlemen, if it weren't for the honor,
I'd rather hitchhike.'' (Laughter.)
   Obviously, it has not been comfortable.
   I think that there has been too much of an eagerness on the part
of some aspects of the media to rush into print or on the airwaves
with unsustained allegations.
   And, there's an old saying, of course, that the answer never
catches up with the charge.
   The charge might be a four-column head above the fold on the
front page, and the answer, when it comes, refuting the charge or
rebutting it or disproving it might come back on page 23, somewhere
in the patent medicine ads.
   So, it's not a comfortable situation.
   And, I think my own impression is that I wish there could be more
balance.
   If I had to look at any single medium and say that that's an
example of balance, I would have to recant some earlier things that
I have said about that organization and say that I think that really
the standard for balance and fairness has been exhibited by the
Washington Post.
   Q. Under what set of circumstances would you withdraw your name
for consideration by the Senate?
   A. William Barret Travis, who was the commandant of the Alamo _
(laughter) _ incidentally, tomorrow is Texas Independence Day _
(laughter) _ and I will be glad to read Travis' last letter from the
Alamo to anyone who would like to assemble with me tomorrow and
listen to it.
   But Travis, in that last letter from the Alamo, said, ``I shall
never surrender or retreat.'' (Applause.)
   Wait a minute.
   I'm _ (laughter) _ I'm a little sorry I brought up the Alamo
analogy because _ (laughter) _ because it just occurred to me what
happened at the Alamo _ (laughter) _ just 10 days after Travis wrote
that letter. (Laughter.)
   But the ultimate outcome was a happy one, because Sam Houston was
able to withdraw his army to the side to sort of there pounce upon
the superior army of Santa Ana and defeat it in one of the great
decisive battles of the world. (Laughter, applause.)

   Lola Perpich has taken an unusually high

campaign, appearing in 30-second ads saying everything is rosy
under the Perpich administration.
   The current ad shows a vase of white roses, with hands from an

   The ad closes with a shot of Lola Perpich suggesting that
Minnesota's high quality of life and well-managed government has

a small picture of the governor in the corner.
   The ``Roses'' ads are part of a double-barrelled attack against

   In previous races for the Texas Railroad
Commission, John Sharp has beaten opponents Sam Ervin and Jack
Daniel.
   Now in his bid for state comptroller, Democrat Sharp is being
challenged by Republican Warren G. Harding Jr. That was the name of
a former Texas treasurer as well as the late president.
   Sharp says he is worried about his latest campaign against yet
another election-year rival with a celebrated name.
   ``Whenever a famous name is taken for granted, they win,'' Sharp
told a news conference.
   The Ervin in Sharp's race was not the famous Watergate senator
and Daniel had no connection to the Tennessee whiskey.
   Among the other names on the ballot in Texas this year.
   Gene Kelly is trying to win a seat on the Texas Supreme Court.
Sam Houston Clinton is seeking re-election to the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals.
   Voters in San Antonio could elect Bart Simpson - a young

   There's something missing from the
carved marble figure of Jim Bowie on the 60-foot shrine to Texas
heroes that stands in front of the Alamo.
   It's the tip of his nose.
   The disfigured face of Bowie, among the best known of the 189
defenders of the Alamo, was discovered Monday when members of a
wreath-bearing procession took part in an event known as the
Pilgrimage to the Alamo.
   Repairs are expected to begin in two weeks, after a grandstand
is removed from Alamo Plaza, officials say.
   The solution? Glue.
   Although vandalism is considered a possibility, officials also
say the marble might have flaked off.
   ``After 50 years, if that's the only damage, that's not too
bad,'' said Alamo Curator Emeritus Charles J. Long said.
   Long, a sculptor and curator of the Pompeo Coppini-Waldine Tauch
Studios, where the Cenotaph was made, discovered the damage Feb.
12, while walking by the Alamo on his way to eat lunch at a nearby
restaurant.
   ``I saw his nose was missing as I walked by, and I looked around
and found pieces of it on the ground,'' Long said.
   Long informed officials of the San Antonio Parks and Recreation
Department and current Alamo Curator Steve Beck, but the damage did
not become public knowledge until Monday.
   ``The tip of the nose is in good shape. It just needs to be
glued back on,'' Long said. Long said the tip can be glued with
ordinary epoxy cement. Marble dust will be mixed with the cement to
fill in gaps.

   There once was a time when people could sit
in the bar of the old Hotel Del Prado and enjoy looking at Diego
Rivera's mural, ``Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park.''
   The once elegant hotel is now an earthquake-damaged hulk waiting
to be demolished, and the mural is in its own museum pavilion
across the street.
   The delicate transfer of the mural has been completed. It
escaped damage in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake that killed
thousands and devastated large parts of the city.
   The famous mural is open to the public again, like a window
opened on Mexico's rich history. It shows figures from the Mexican
political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the
park.
   An explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the
decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the
extent of the damage there became clear.
   ``It should be linked to the Alameda, for having been painted on
that theme and for the place itself,'' the plaque from the National
Fine Arts Institute says.
   The Alameda, the downtown park across the street and down a
block from the mural's old home, also was expanded through
earthquake reconstruction programs. A ``Solidarity Garden''
recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of
the cleared, adjoining block that once held a department store and
the Hotel Regis.
   The mural's pavilion is built on the site of the hotel's parking
garage, which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake.
   The Fine Arts Institute said that no room could be found in any
of its buildings close to the Alameda, ``because of the colossal
dimensions of the work. ... That's why it was decided to take
advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate
building.''
   In place of the old hotel's comfortable cocktail lounge, viewers
now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or
just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room.
Diagrams, with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure, tell
who 73 of the people shown in the mural are.
   Among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face,
a self-portrait _ something Rivera often put in his works.
   In the foreground is Spanish conqueror Hernando Cortes. On a
park bench an elderly man dreams of President Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna, giving American Gen. William Scott the keys to Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada and other lands that once
belonged to Mexico.
   Farther back, a former military man, now poor, dreams of the
emperors Maximilian and Carlota. A drunken tramp, next to an old
woman, dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories, at the side
of Benito Juarez, who holds the reform laws he put into effect as
Mexico's great 19th century president.
   Near the center is dictator Porfirio Diaz and his wife, Carmen
Romero Rubio. Diaz appears full of his fame and power, with a chest
full of ribbons on his uniform.
   At the right, a street vendor offers typical Mexican food to a
middle-class youth and three students, who dream of Gen. Victoriano
Huerta. Official history says Huerta had Francisco I. Madero, who
started the 1910-21 Mexican revolution, killed.
   Rivera completed the 49{ foot by 13 foot painting for the then
fashionable Del Prado in 1948.
   Along with David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco,
Rivera was one of Mexico's three great muralists and one of the
most important Latin American painters in the art world. He died in
1957.
   Among his other best known murals are those in the National
Palace of the Spanish conquest, the Mexican revolution and other
events from the country's history.
   ``The composition is memories of my life, of my childhood and my
youth, from 1895 to 1910,'' Rivera wrote after finishing the mural.
``I do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone.
The contemporary figures in the fresco, as figures in dreams, are
not portraits.''
   It was an apparent reference to the phrase, ``God Does Not
Exist,'' a quote attributed to Juarez adviser Ignacio Ramirez and
written on a piece of paper by Ramirez in the mural.
   Eight years after the mural was completed, Rivera changed the
paper to read, ``Conference in the Academy of Letran, the year
1836.'' The phrase refers to the date and place where Ramirez made
his controversial comment.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (8): Baby breaks with the past - Profile:
Southwestern Bell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<TEXT>
THE thing about San Antonio, deep in southern Texas, is that a river runs
through it. The city has other interesting features - not least the Alamo,
the fort where 189 volunteers died fighting for an independent Texas rather
than surrender to the massed ranks of the Mexican army. But it is the river
that sets the tone of the place, winding its way through the heart of the
city a few feet below street level. Southwestern Bell's head office sits on
its banks.
Until last year, Southwestern Bell had looked as deeply rooted as ever in
its home town of St Louis, Missouri. Although the company became an
independent entity less than a decade ago with the break-up of the Bell
telephone companies into seven Baby Bells, its operations had been based in
St Louis since 1879. The company's decision to transplant its 580
headquarters staff to San Antonio was therefore as much of a shock for
Missouri as it was an economic coup for Texas.
The fact that the Baby Bells are making headlines adds another dimension to
the move. As the companies seek new opportunities outside their heavily
regulated, low growth local telephone businesses, they appear to be
competing to see which can do the biggest deal - as with last month's
multi-billion-dollar merger agreement between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications Inc, the US cable television giant.
Southwestern Bell, though it has yet to match the sheer scale of the Bell
Atlantic deal with TCI, has been at least as busy as most other Baby Bells.
It has become one of the biggest US operators of cellular communications
services; it is spending Dollars 650m to buy two cable systems outside
Washington DC from Hauser Communications; it is one of the three biggest
cable television companies in the UK, and it has acquired a controlling
stake in Telefonos de Mexico, better known as Telmex, the Mexican national
telephone company.
Southwestern Bell readily acknowledges that San Antonio is an attractive
city: it would hardly have relocated there otherwise. But it says the main
reasons for the move were pragmatic, and closely related to its business
strategy.
First was the desire to get closer to the place where most of its business
is done. Southwestern Bell provides local telephone services for nearly 10m
homes and businesses in five south-western states: Texas, Arkansas, Kansas,
Missouri and Oklahoma. But according to Mr Jim Epperson, director of
corporate communications, the company's Texas business is growing much more
rapidly than the rest. Already, the state accounts for 60 per cent of total
corporate revenues, and the figure is expected to reach 70 per cent by the
year 2000.
Mr Epperson says that proximity to the company's biggest customer base is
more than a matter of convenience. 'When you're doing business in Texas, it
makes a big difference to be able to say that you're a Texas headquartered
company,' he says. 'It gives you a clear marketing edge.'
The second reason was the desire to get closer to Telmex. Southwestern
Bell's Dollars 1bn investment in this company appears to have vast
potential. In 1992, only 40 per cent of Mexican households had telephone
lines, but the proportion is growing rapidly: indeed, it is conceivable that
revenues from Southwestern Bell's stake in Telmex could overtake those from
its core business in a decade.
For a US company doing business with Mexico, probably the next best thing to
being in Mexico itself is to be in Texas - and better still, in San Antonio,
the nearest big city to the border. For although Texas is not the only state
to share a border with Mexico, it is easily Mexico's biggest trading
partner: and if, as Southwestern Bell fervently hopes, the North American
Free Trade Agreement is signed, cross-border business will boom, to the
company's great benefit.
According to Mr Michael Wagner, Southwestern Bell's director of investor
relations, the third significant factor lying behind the relocation to Texas
was a cultural one. Like all the Baby Bells, Southwestern Bell has been
trying to demonstrate that it has shaken off the sleepy, moribund management
style of its pre-1984 parent in favour of a bolder approach aimed above all
at increasing shareholder wealth.
The purpose of the move was therefore to mark the break with the past in the
most decisive way possible - by physically uprooting the business and its
employees and moving them to a new environment.
The move notwithstanding, Southwestern Bell still has difficulties to
confront. Like other Baby Bells, it is waging a campaign to shake off the
fetters of a regulatory environment that it regards as outdated in the
fast-changing and increasingly competitive world of communications: for
example, rules that govern the rate of return it is allowed to make on local
telephone services, and barriers preventing its expansion into markets for
other services such as long-distance calls.
There is also the danger that some of these big mergers and acquisitions,
like other flavour-of-the-month corporate sprees, could ultimately prove
less attractive than they appeared.
And if, on occasion, things do not turn out quite as planned, Southwestern
Bell's executives will at least be able to step outside their office block,
take a stroll down the river walk, and console themselves with the thought
that San Antonio is a very pleasant place to be.

   Shamu, Namu and Kandu are readying a
killer of a sea show that organizers hope will fishtail with the
Alamo and the city's River Walk.
   While the killer whales swim around in a 7 million gallon tank,
gardeners are putting the final landscaping touches on Sea World of
Texas, a $140 million, 250-acre facility billed as the nation's
largest marine theme park.
   The park's ``Big Splash'' opening is set for May 28, but
workers, animals and trainers are already performing in rehearsals
for visitors.
   Sea World, 13 miles northwest of downtown San Antonio, will be
open year-round. It is expected to employ 2,000 people during its
peak summer season, generate a $25 million annual payroll and
attract 3 million visitors bearing another $300 million yearly for
the park's and South Texas' economies.
   City and tourist industry officials have looked at Sea World as
a magnet for tourists to help the state diversify from its
dependency on petroleum, but Sea World chairman George Becker warns
against expecting too much too soon.
   ``I've cautioned a few people that we'll do the very best that
we can, but not to rest on their laurels and expect us to be the
end-all and the answer to all of their business problems,'' he said.
   Visitors can expect to see the park's star, Shamu, a two-ton
killer whale that was among the fish and animals brought in from
three other Sea World parks around the country.
   Shamu will perform in a 4,500-seat stadium. At other, smaller
stadiums, dolphins, seals, sea lions, walruses and other animals
will show their stuff, too.
   Skiers will perform acrobatics in a 12-acre lake, and visitors
can walk across the United States via a one-acre ``map'' of the
country.
   There are restaurants, lounges, a disco for teen-agers and a
playground for children. There also is Cypress Gardens West, a
botanical center where a variety of flowers will bloom year-round.
   San Antonio tourism already generates more than $1 billion
annually, with lures like the Alamo and the River Walk.
   Texas is home to Six Flags of Texas in Arlington and to
AstroWorld in Houston, both of which attract about 1.7 million
visitors a year each.
   Tourist industry officials believe Sea World will help, not
hurt, those amusement parks.
   ``It's actually going to help them because it completes the
triangle of from San Antonio, Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth
area,'' said Larry Todd, director of the Texas Tourist Agency.
   He said Sea World is following the lead of other tourist
attractions by promoting Texas first and its location second.
   ``I don't think tourism is a panacea, but it's all fresh, new
money and it's an immediate boost to the economy and it's rapidly
becoming one of our top industries,'' Todd said.
   ``We Texans had better face the fact that tourism is an industry
whose time has come. We have sat back and been dependent on oil and
agriculture and haven't needed tourism, and now all of a sudden we
need it and we need to market Texas intelligently,'' he said.
   (Sea World's one-day admission is $18.95 for adults and $15.95
for senior citizens (55 and older) and children 3-11. A 12-month
pass is $49 for adults and $39 for children. Founders Club pass,
available until May 28, is $125 and offers special discounts and is
good for admission through Dec. 31, 1991. Sea World sales office
number is 512-523-3400.)

   Rep. Richard Gephardt emphasized his
support for an oil-import fee on Monday, one day before four
oil-producing states vote on Super Tuesday, then went to the Alamo
to call himself the Democratic candidate for economic independence.
   ``We're standing today in front of the Alamo, a place where
there was a fight for independence,'' Gephardt said. ``This
election in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of America,
the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny.''
   Gephardt spoke to about 400 supporters and tourists in this
city, generally considered a stronghold for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, after speaking at a struggling Dallas plant that
makes equipment for the oil industry.
   Dukakis was at the Alamo Sunday. Many of the Democrats here are
Hispanic, and Dukakis spoke to them in fluent Spanish.
   But Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, supporting Gephardt, told
the rally on Monday that no one suffers more from the oil
industry's downturn than South Texas Hispanics.
   ``If you want somebody who speaks Spanish, I do a little of that
and I can interpret for Dick,'' Bustamante said, noting that
Gephardt has begun studying Spanish. San Antonio Mayor Henry
Cisneros has stayed neutral, although his wife has endorsed Dukakis.
   Gephardt recalled he trained for the Missouri Air National Guard
at Lackland Air Force Base near here. He then attacked Dukakis for
wanting to cut the defense budget.
   ``He's going to leave us in jeopardy and vulnerable,'' Gephardt
said.
   He continued to criticize his foes for opposing an oil-import
fee.
   ``Anyone like Al Gore or Michael Dukakis who tells you that
they're for making America energy independent is simply trying to
deceive you in a shameful way,'' Gephardt said after touring
Dresser Industries, a Dallas plant that Gephardt said shows the
need for long-term domestic energy policy because of its nearly 50
percent cutbacks in operation.
   Gephardt has concentrated on Gore and Dukakis in his Texas
swing. Polls indicate he and Gore are battling for third behind
Dukakis and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. But Gephardt said
his chances for winning Texas were good.

   A candidate for the state's highest criminal court
is publicizing his campaign with a contest that asks entrants about
the race and promises a free trip to Sea World to the winner.
   Judge Tom Rickhoff of San Antonio, who says his bid for the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has received little attention,
placed a full-page ad in the September issue of Texas Monthly
magazine with pictures of himself, a penguin and a dolphin under
the headline ``A Real Political Contest.''
   The ad includes a contest entry form that invites Texans to
answer four true-or-false questions about Rickhoff's race against
incumbent Judge Charles Miller.
   The winner, to be selected in a drawing Oct. 18, gets a
four-day, three-night vacation in San Antonio, complete with passes
to see Sea World of Texas, tickets to a San Antonio Spurs
basketball game and a tour of the Alamo.
   And there are prizes for the runners-up: 10 pounds of Tex-Mex
frozen shrimp, three pairs of jogging shoes and an assortment of
candy.
   ``It's innovative,'' said Rickhoff, who is currently a
Republican state district judge in San Antonio.
   ``This is embarrassing,'' Miller said.
   Randy Erben, assistant secretary of state, said his office has
studied Rickhoff's contest and concluded it does not violate state
election law.
   Miller said the idea shows poor judgment.
   ``It creates a circus atmosphere in a race that ought to be
dealt with seriously,'' he said.
   Rickhoff said he decided to conduct the contest after finding
that people not only didn't recognize his name, but had never heard
of the Court of Criminal Appeals, the court of last resort for
criminal cases in Texas.
   He said he wants to ``dramatize the fact that there is a citizen
wall of apathy around the race.'' He added that he's received only
about two dozen entries.
   The contest entry blank also has a box that can be checked for
donations, but the ad specifies that entrants need not contribute
to enter the contest.

   John Tower, his nomination as defense secretary
in grave trouble, made an extraordinary public admission of marital
infidelity Wednesday but vowed to keep fighting for Senate
confirmation. His prospects dimmed further, however, by the Senate
majority leader's opposition.
   President Bush continued to court Democrats in a last-ditch
effort to save the appointment, and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
asserted, ``We'll just keep up the good fight.''
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell further dampened
Tower's chances by declaring his opposition, even as Vice President
Dan Quayle conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed
for Senate approval.
   The president said his appeal to senators has been, ``Look, do
what you've got to do, but remember fair play, remember decency and
honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and
consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the
president of the United States who after all is responsible for the
executive branch of this government.''
   Bush dispatched Quayle to Capitol Hill to lobby for the
nomination.
   ``We hope the prospects improve. We don't have 50 votes yet. But
we're moving in that direction,'' Quayle told a White House photo
session.
   The White House effort failed with at least one conservative
Democrat, Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, who announced his opposition
to the nomination and urged Tower to withdraw. Boren was one of two
Democrats to vote for former President Reagan's unpopular Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who had been invited to a White House
session with Bush, declared his opposition, saying Tower ``is just
not the right person for the position of secretary of defense.''
   Mitchell announced that floor debate on the nomination had been
postponed until Thursday as the ranking members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., met
with White House counsel C. Boyden Gray to decide what material from
the FBI report could be made public.
   Tower showed flashes of grit and humor as he fielded questions at
the National Press Club about allegations concerning excessive
drinking, womanizing and lucrative consulting fees he received from
defense contractors.
   Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn, he replied
by quoting from the last letter written by Col. William Barrett
Travis, the leader of the Texans who fought and died at the Alamo:
``I shall never surrender or retreat.''
   The former Texas senator paused briefly and said, ``I am a little
sorry I brought up the Alamo analogy. It just occurred to me what
happened at the Alamo just 10 days after Travis wrote that letter.''
Texas defenders were wiped out by the Mexicans.
   Tower said he regards his weekend vow to quit drinking if he wins
confirmation as ``sacred ... and I can assure you I will abide by
it.''
   His speech addressed defense policy issues, matters Tower said
``normally occupy the mind of the nominee of secretary of defense.''
But he unflinchingly fielded questions from his audience about his
personal behavior.
   Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, the
twice-divorced Tower said, ``As a matter of fact, I have broken
wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.''
   Tower's second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, alleged ``marital
misconduct'' in court papers in the couple's divorce case.
   But later Wednesday, Tower aides released a statement clarifying
his admission of marital infidelity, and administration sources
indicated Tower was referring to his first marriage, not his second.
   The statement noted that Tower, in his opening testimony before
the Senate Armed Services Committee, repeatedly stated that he had
never been unfaithful to his second wife.
   ``The senator stands by his statement, and he notes that marriage
vows have to do with a great deal more than the question of
infidelity,'' the statement said. ``However, the senator's oath and
pledge to the American people is of the same character as is the
oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States; an
oath he has never broken.''
   Administration sources, who insisted on anonymity, elaborated by
disclosing the Senate Armed Services Committee had been told that
Tower was divorced from his first wife, Lou, because of an
adulterous affair with the woman who became his second wife.
   There was no letup, meanwhile, in the political storm surrounding
the nomination.
   The administration is trying to hold all 45 Republicans and sway
five of the Senate's 55 Democrats to get a tie vote that Quayle
could break in favor of Tower.
   An Associated Press survey of the Senate found 36 Republicans
supporting the nomination, 36 Democrats opposed and 27 other
senators undecided or undeclared. One senator was unavailable for
comment.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, the Democratic leader, announced his
opposition to the nomination in a midday speech on the Senate floor,
citing Tower's ties to defense consultants and his drinking.
   Mitchell's position was widely anticipated, particularly since
all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have
opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it.
   Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct,
Mitchell told his colleagues that ``it is not moral perfection or
the qualifications of senators that are at issue here. It is the
ability to serve effectively in a position of unique power and
responsibility.''
   Mitchell said he read the FBI report on Tower and met with Bush
at the White House where he expressed his concerns about the
nomination.
   ``It is only after careful study of this record that I have
concluded that John Tower is not the man to provide leadership by
example to the military and civilian employees of the Department of
Defense, especially in the difficult job of reforming the Pentagon's
administration and procurement practices in a period of budget
stringency,'' Mitchell said.
   Tower lashed out at what he said was the absence of clearly
defined standards against which he was being judged. He noted that
several senators have said that the secretary of defense, as the
commander of U.S. military forces behind only the president, must
adhere to a higher standard. ``I accept that ... but my question is
how much,'' he said.
   He then asked whether it is ``acceptable for members late in the
evening who had a few drinks in hideaways ... to come onto the floor
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear
deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and
paid vacations ``from special interests who have a vested interest
in the legislative process.''

   The Soviet Union's top-ranking military
officer saw traditional Indian dancing and an old-fashioned cowboy
shoot-'em-up Saturday on a whirlwind visit to Oklahoma after
protesters in Texas told his delegation to ``Go home, murderers.''
   Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev and his group also got to
see cattle roping, trick roping and square dancing as the state
provided the visitors with a taste of Western heritage.
   This is the first visit of the ranking Soviet military leader to
the United States. The weeklong tour of several cities is designed
to give the Soviet officers the chance to see typical American life
in addition to the military aspects.
   ``The times really have been changing for the better, and are
changing for the better, because of the politically courageous
decisions by our two political leaders,'' Ahkromeyev said shortly
before the evening ended. ``We need to carry out and maintain a
stable and friendly relationship.''
   Saturday morning, when the Soviet delegation was at the Alamo in
San Antonio, two demonstrators told Akhromeyev that he did not
belong at Texas' most famous shrine. But Akhromeyev's visit there
was more peaceful than the greeting he received upon his arrival in
San Antonio on Friday night.
   About 50 demonstrators chanted ``Go home, murderers!'' when
Akhromeyev and several other Soviet officers showed up at the
Institute of Texan Cultures.
   ``I feel it's really a crime to invite these killers here when
they are committing genocide in Afghanistan and terrorism around
the world,'' said Sayed Nasir, a mechanical engineer from
Afghanistan.
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon was host for Saturday evening's
entertainment. During the festivities, Akhromeyev was presented
with an Indian headdress, and he and several other Soviet officials
were invited to try their hand at branding some cattle. None took
up the offer.
   Ten-year-old Charlie Ward was one of a group of youngsters who
took part in a trick roping demonstration for the entourage. ``It
made me feel good,'' he said afterward. ``It's the kind of
friendship between the Soviets and Americans, getting to know
them.''
   Earlier in the day, Akhromeyev and U.S. Adm. William Crowe,

TOWER CHALLENGES SENATORS TO CHECK THEIR OWN MORALS;

<P>
A combative John Tower said today that senators questioning his fitness to be 
defense secretary should look to their own moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
The embattled Tower unleashed a two-fisted defense of his own character and 
counterattacks against his critics shortly before the Senate was expected to 
formally begin debate on his nomination, which Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) declared against today. 
</P>
<P>
Tower made clear that he and President Bush have no intention of withdrawing 
the nomination, quoting the last words of fellow Texan Col. William Travis in 
the 19th-Century battle of the Alamo: "I shall never surrender or retreat." 
</P>
<P>
Travis and all the American defenders were wiped out by the Mexican army that 
besieged and eventually overran them at the Alamo, and the battle has become 
synonymous with gallantry but also with losing causes. 
</P>
<P>
Tower later said the comparison was unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, under attack like no Cabinet nominee in memory on allegations of alcohol 
abuse, womanizing and close ties to defense contractors, made his feisty 
comments in response to questions during an appearance at the National Press 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is bothered that there is "no clearly defined standard against which 
I could be judged. The standards seemed to evolve to fit the situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher standard," 
Tower said. But he added, pointedly, "My question is, how much lower an 
acceptable standard is there for members of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it an acceptable standard for senators, late in the evening, who've had a 
few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the Capitol a few steps away from 
the Senate chamber, to come on the floor and vote on vital issues of nuclear 
deterrence?" Tower asked, pulling into the open the well-known -- but little 
discussed -- fact that a number of lawmakers have appeared inebriated on the 
Senate floor over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In a response to suggestions of conflict of interest, Tower posed this 
question: "Is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria, PAC 
(political action committee) contributions and paid vacations from special 
interests, who have a vested interest in the legislative process?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . it is time Congress articulated what its own standards are," 
said Tower, who served more than two decades in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The twice-divorced Tower repeated his vow to swear off drinking altogether if 
confirmed, and in a tart reply to a question about whether he had broken vows 
in the past -- specifically, his wedding vows -- said: "As a matter of fact, I 
have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection." 
</P>
<P>
While he dealt directly with the issues threatening to derail his nomination, 
Tower also showed his flare for cut-and-thrust humor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about the furor his nomination has caused, Tower replied: "I 
feel a little bit like the fellow that had been immersed in tar and feathers 
and was being ridden out of town on a rail, and he said, 'Really, gentlemen, if 
it weren't for the honor, I'd rather hitchhike.' "

   An alleged drug kingpin and two other inmates
escaped from a privately run prison across from the police station
after one of them pulled a gun on a guard, authorities said.
   Five federal agencies plus Mexican, Texas and local officials
were searching today for the men who escaped Sunday evening. They
include Mario Alberto Salinas Trevino, who federal authorities
allege masterminded one of the largest drug-smuggling and
money-laundering rings between Texas and Mexico.
   Police said the three men may be heading to Mexico and are
considered armed and dangerous. At its closest point, the border is
about 100 miles away.
   Salinas, 37, was among 25 people arrested in March 1989 in a
drug operation dubbed ``Operation Jet Set.''
   U.S. Marshal Bill Jonas said $10 million was seized from Salinas
then, and he's suspected of having up to $10 million in drug money
stashed in a hideaway either in Texas or Mexico.
   Prosecutors charge that between 1983 and 1989, a drug ring
Salinas helped run was responsible for transporting more than
46,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,900 pounds of cocaine. The ring
allegedly distributed the drugs throughout Texas, Pennsylvania,
California, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts.
   The ring also is accused of laundering of more than $7.6
million, using financial institutions in San Antonio and Roma,
Texas and San Ysidro, Calif., to launder narcotics profits.
   Jonas identified the other inmates as Charlie Edward Compton,
58, and Juan Chapa Garza, 44. Compton was awaiting trial on federal
charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Chapa
was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
The charges were not related to the ``Jet Set'' probe.
   Compton and Salinas are U.S. citizens, Jonas said. He wasn't
sure about Chapa's nationality.
   The three were cellmates at the Central Texas Parole Violators
Facility, a minimum- to medium-security prison in the old Bexar
County jail operated by Wackenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, Fla.
   Compton summoned a guard, claiming he was ill, and pulled a
handgun on him shortly before 9 p.m., Jonas said.
   The three then locked up two guards in the closet and
overpowered another guard on the ground floor before seizing the
security control panels and opening a door, Jonas said. They fled
on foot.
   According to police reports, San Antonio police weren't notified
of the jailbreak until nearly an hour after the three men had
escaped.
   But Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan said police were notified 15
to 20 minutes after the jail break by the guard on the ground
floor, who was tied up outside.
   ``It took him about 15 to 20 minutes to get unloose and he ran
straight across the street to the police department,'' Cannan said.
``That was the proper thing to do.''
   Jonas said he had no indication that Wackenhut had delayed the
reporting unneccessarily.
   Wackenhut officials speculate the pistol was smuggled into the
prison during Easter Day visiting hours, Cannan said. He spoke in a
telephone interview from Coral Gables. Jonas said the gun was
believed to be a .25-caliber.
   ``We suspect it was brought in by a visitor,'' he said. Cannan
said the prison screens visitors, but he declined to give details.
   The inmates were being held in the private facility for the U.S.
Marshal's Service, Cannan said. The 620-capacity prison was housing
583 people Sunday, about 100 of them Marshal's Service prisoners,
Cannan said. The prison has 125 guards, 20 to 25 per shift, he said.
   The Marshal's Service has summoned assistance from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Adminstration, FBI, Customs Service, Immigration and
Naturalization Service and Mexican customs, Jonas said. State and
local officials also were involved in the search.

   Local, federal and Mexican officials on
Monday searched for a suspected leader of a multimillion-dollar
drug ring and two other inmates who pulled a gun on a guard and
escaped from a privately operated jail.
   The three cellmates at the Central Texas Parole Violators
Facility fled late Sunday on foot.
   One of the three lured a guard to the cell by pretending to be
sick, then pulled a .25-caliber handgun, said U.S. Marshal Bill
Jonas. The three inmates then locked up two guards in a closet and
overpowered another before seizing the security control panels and
opening a door, Jonas said.
   Officials of Wackenhut Corp., which operates the supplementary
jail under contract with Bexar County to alleviate jail crowding,
speculate the pistol was smuggled inside during visiting hours
Sunday, said Pat Cannan, spokesman for the Coral Gables, Fla.,
company.
   Visitors are screened at the prison, across the street from
police headquarters, but Cannan would not give details of the
process.
   The escapees were identified as Mario Alberto Salinas Trevino,
Charlie Edward Compton and Juan Chapa Garza.
   Salinas, 37, led one of the largest drug-smuggling and
money-laundering rings between Texas and Mexico, authorities said.
He was among 25 people arrested last year in ``Operation Jet Set,''
a series of raids by federal authorities in California and Texas.
   Authorities seized $10 million from Salinas when he was
arrested. He's also suspected of having up to $10 million in drug
money stashed in Texas or Mexico, Jonas said.
   Law enforcement authorities suspect Salinas would go to Mexico,
about 150 miles away.
   ``That's a logical escape route,'' said Jonas. ``If that's the
case, I think he's acting ill-advisedly. I have every reason to
believe the Mexican government will cooperate with us.''
   Salinas allegedly led a drug ring with Ramiro Mirales Felix of
Guadalajara, Mexico, federal prosecutors said when Salinas was
arrested.
   Officials allege the ring transported more than 46,000 pounds of
marijuana, 1,900 pounds of cocaine and made financial transactions
or purchases in excess of $7.6 million. The ring allegedly
distributed the drugs in Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois,
Florida and Massachusetts.
   Indictments alleged the ring used banks in San Antonio and Roma,
Texas, and San Ysidro, Calif., to launder the narcotics profits.
   Compton was awaiting trial on possession of cocaine with intent
to distribute charges. Chapa was charged with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute.
   The fugitives' cases were not connected, Jonas said, but added:
``I would think that the three of them would stay together for
awhile.''
