FT  29 JUL 94 / One strike and they're out: ball players are set to walk

Baseball players in the top US professional league will down their bats,
balls and gloves on August 12 for an indefinite period if negotiations with
team owners over pay and other issues do not lead to the signing of a new
labour contract.
If the strike goes ahead, it will be the first baseball stoppage since 1988,
and the eighth in 22 years.
It also be especially ill-timed, because baseball's popularity this season
was beginning to recover from years of decline thanks to outstanding
performances by players who were threatening to rewrite the record books.
At least three young stars are currently on course to surpass the sport's
most hallowed record - the 61 home runs hit by Roger Maris of the New York
Yankees in 1961.
Yet this strike may make history of a different kind: it could be the
longest stoppage ever. Previous disputes have proved short-lived because the
owners quickly caved in to the players' demands. This time, baseball pundits
fear the stadiums could remain shut until the season ends in late September,
and perhaps even into next year, such is the lack of common ground between
the two sides.
The dispute involves the use of television and attendance revenues, and the
owners' insistence that a new labour contract includes a salary cap  - a
limit on how much each team is allowed to spend on player salaries.
The owners say rapidly increasing salaries have put clubs, especially those
in smaller cities, under a great financial strain, and argue that the sport
will only prosper over the long term if players agree to a cap and to split
revenues 50-50. Currently, there is no limit on how much each club can spend
on players, who receive about 58 per cent of total revenues.
The players' union, however, believes the cap would cost its members
millions of dollars in lost earnings and destroy free agency - the system
which allows them to move freely between clubs under certain conditions.
Since the union won the right to free agency in the mid-1970s, the average
player's salary has risen from just over Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 1.2m
(Pounds 770,000).
The union has also proposed that the minimum salary be raised from Dollars
109,000 to Dollars 175,000-Dollars 200,000, and that the rights to salary
arbitration be restored to players with two years of service in the major
leagues. The owners, however have rejected these proposals, claiming they
would cost clubs Dollars 1.57bn-Dollars 1.65bn over seven years.
Fans, meanwhile, view the developments with increasing disbelief. Many see
the dispute as a row over money between greedy millionaires (the players)
and greedy billionaires (the owners).
This week a group called 'Fans First' called for people to boycott a day of
baseball games next month in protest at the players' and owners' behaviour.

It was the US Labor Day holiday yesterday, and President Bill Clinton had
weighty matters of labour relations on his mind - the country's baseball
strike, now into its fourth week.
'I might say, on this Labor Day, there's still time for them to go back and
finish the best baseball season in 50 years, and I hope they will,' said Mr
Clinton, taking time off from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard for a speech
at a Maine shipyard.
Mr Robert Reich, the president's top labour official, was also on the case.
He has offered to mediate between the two sides, but said yesterday there
was no point in mediating unless both sides actually wanted to negotiate.
For the first time since Labor Day was established 100 years ago, there was
no major league baseball to watch on the holiday that traditionally marks
the end of summer.
Hopes are fading fast that the deadlock between the players and the team
owners might be broken in time for at least a truncated championship
play-off.
The owners insist the players must agree to a salary cap. The players insist
there can be no serious negotiation until the idea of a salary cap has been
dropped.
On a Labor Day when New York City's trade unions could not muster enough
support for their traditional parade, the doggedness of the tiny baseball
players' union in pursuing its eighth strike in 23 years stands in sharp
contrast to the weakness of the rest of the union movement.
Today only 11 per cent of the private sector workforce is represented by a
trade union, with only the government employees' unions showing anything
like the bargaining tenacity of the professional sports unions.
That may have something to do with the fact that most baseball players,
whose average salary now tops Dollars 1m, have put something aside for a
rainy day, and can also supplement their income while they are on strike by
selling autographs or through advertising endorsements.
At least for sofa sports fans the American Football season has started.

It was Labour Day yesterday in the US, as in 'Thou shalt not'. Professional
baseball players were taking the injunction seriously.
For the first time since this public holiday was established in the US a
hundred years ago, there was no major league baseball to watch on the
holiday that, by tradition, marks the end of summer. The players' strike was
into week four.
Hopes are fading that the deadlock between the players and the team owners
might be broken in time for a truncated championship play-off at least.
Mr Bud Selig, acting baseball commissioner - he is one of the team owners
standing in for the last commissioner, who was fired for showing too much
interest in the game and not enough in the owners' balance sheets - said
this week that he would cancel the entire season if there were no movement
by Friday.
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, has offered to mediate between the two
sides, but he said yesterday that there was no point in mediating unless
both sides want to negotiate.
The owners insist that the players must agree to a salary cap. The players
insist that there can be no serious talks until that has been dropped.
On a Labour Day when New York City's more traditional trade unions could not
muster enough support for their parade, the doggedness of the players'
union, on its eighth strike in 23 years, stands in contrast to the weakness
of the rest of the union movement.
Today, only 11 per cent of the private sector US workforce is represented by
a union, and only the public sector unions show anything like the tenacity
of the professional games players.
Sofa sports fans, who have had to content themselves with Little League
baseball during the strike, now at least have the new American football
season, which began on Sunday. In that game, the players agreed to a salary
limit per team, and many have had to agree in the last few weeks to a pay
cut.

PLAYERS FILING FOR ARBITRATION GET 82% PAY RAISES 
</P>

<P>
Baseball players who filed for arbitration had an average salary increase of 
$348,269 this year, according to an Associated Press survey. The 82% jump is 
the most since before collusion and will push the major-league average to about 
$600,000 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The 159 players whose teams agreed to arbitration had an average salary of 
$422,735 in 1989. Their 1990 average, including prorated shares of signing 
bonuses and other guaranteed money, will be $771,004. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the salaries of players in arbitration rose 70%, following a 65% 
rise in 1988 and a 35% increase in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Using an alternate method of calculation -- average annual values -- the 
increase was even sharper: 102%, the biggest rise since 1981. Many players have 
structured their contracts to take lower salaries this season because of fear 
of a prolonged lockout or strike. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight players in arbitration doubled their salaries, 21 tripled them, 
five quadrupled them, and Mike Bielecki of the Pittsburgh Pirates increased his 
fivefold, from $122,500 to $675,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki's 451% increase was followed by Ruben Sierra's 355% jump from $357,500 
to $1,625,000 and Fred McGriff's 346% increase from $325,000 to $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistical comparisons with recent years, the average salary 
should rise to between $590,000 and $620,000 in 1990. The exact number will 
depend on which players make opening day rosters. 
</P>
<P>
Although 161 players filed, just 24 players had hearings; 14 won. Two players, 
Greg Minton of the Angels and John Candelaria of the Montreal Expos, were 
refused arbitration by their clubs and became free agents -- Minton re-signed 
with the Angels on Wednesday -- and the others reached contract agreements with 
their teams. 
</P>
<P>
Players won seven of 12 hearings last year, giving them a better than .500 
record in consecutive years for the first time since 1979-81. Owners still have 
a 164-139 advantage since the process began in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 winners this year increased their salaries by 141%, $373,179 to 
$900,357. The 10 losers increased their salaries by 106%, from $441,700 to 
$909,000. 
</P>
<P>
Collective-bargaining negotiations have deadlocked on the issue of arbitration 
eligibility. Players want the minimum service time rolled back to two years, 
where it was before the 1985 agreement. Owners want it to remain at three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Players with between three and four years' service, almost all in arbitration 
for the first time, did particularly well, the AP study found. Their average 
jumped 158%, from $192,957 to $497,178. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the salaries of players in arbitration for the first time increased 
by 137%. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two players who filed for arbitration got multiyear contracts this 
winter, up from 19 last year, 13 in 1988 and four in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for the AP survey were obtained over the past two months from numerous 
player and management sources. They do not include any potential income from 
incentive bonus opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Pittsburgh Pirates had hearings, the most for any club since the 1974 
Oakland Athletics.

<TEXT>
   They average $230,000 in salary for working less than six months of the year. 
If they are injured on the job, their employers assume medical costs. 
When they close out their careers, their employers pay them a handsome pension. 

   But that's not enough, say the 1,400 striking players of the National Football League. 
They want "free agency" -- the ability to sell their services on the open market to the highest bidder among the league's 28 employers. 
That way, they say, they can bring their average compensation closer in line with that received by their peers in professional baseball and basketball. 

   The NFL Players Union complains that, in the league's system of free agency, players are little more than chattel property of NFL owners. 
First, it argues, the league conducts a draft of college seniors, granting each of its 28 franchises exclusive rights to the players selected. 
Then when a player's contract with a particular club expires, he may offer his talents to other teams, but his original club has the right to match any rival offers. 
If a player signs with another team, his original employer is entitled to compensation in the draft based on the player's salary level. 

   Over the past 10 seasons, roughly 2,000 players have qualified for free agency. 
Only one has signed with another club. 
This statistic, the players' union maintains, is prima facie evidence that the NFL enforces a closed labor market. 

   The players' grievance reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of their profession. 
By suggesting that the owners are engaged in labor-market collusion, the players imply that the 28 NFL clubs operate as competitive, independent enterprises. 
The clubs do compete -- but only on the playing field. 
Where matters of finances are concerned, it's one for all and all for one. 

   The league has a formula for evenly apportioning revenues from television contracts, licensing arrangements, gate receipts and other sources among the 28 franchises. 
No matter how successful or unsuccessful a team is on the playing field -- whether it is a Super Bowl contender or league doormat -- it receives approximately the same amount of league revenue as any other club. 

   Thus, the addition or subtraction of a player -- no matter how talented -- has little if any impact on an NFL club's bottom line. 
It is unlike professional baseball or basketball, in which a star player can not only make a difference in a franchise's fortunes on the field, but off the field as well. 
Indeed, a popular player in those sports -- a Larry Bird or a Dwight Gooden -- can measurably boost a club's attendance, and thereby increase revenues. 
Attendance figures much less in an NFL club's profitability and owners rely less on individual performers to draw fans to the stadiums. 

   The NFL is not an entire industry. 
It is more a single entity, with 28 appendages. 
Any owner under the delusion that he is operating in a competitive market would threaten the stability of the entire institution. 
The same goes for the players. 
Whatever individual club they play for, they ultimately work for "NFL Inc." 
NFL Inc., with its 28 subsidiaries, competes collectively for consumers' entertainment dollars. 
The sooner the NFL players recognize this, the sooner they can stop throwing eggs at other "free agents" and get back to playing football.

<TEXT>     According to figures compiled by the New York Times from contract data
obtained from management and player sources, the average opening-day major
league salary for all players (708 total) is $890,844, an astonishing 53
percent more than last year's opening-day average.;    In previous years, no
individual team's average salary ever reached this year's major league average
salary. The record for a team average was set by the New York Mets in 1989 at
$865,741.;    The A's, with a record $36.4 million payroll and 14 of their 27
players receiving $1 million or more, have the highest team average,
$1,349,352.;    The Giants rose from 12th to sixth on the list at $1,117,619.;
   The Houston Astros are at the other end of the salary standings with an
average of $487,090.;    The five members of the A's who are signed for $3
million or more -- total $16.7 million -- make more than the entire payrolls
of Houston, Baltimore or Seattle. Add Mark McGwire, and the $19.55 million
total is higher than the payroll of those three teams plus Cleveland and the
Chicago White Sox.;    Then throw in Dave Henderson, and the $22.15 million
total is higher than the payrolls of those five clubs plus Texas, Montreal,
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta and San Diego, or 11 of the other 25 clubs.; 
  The overall increase is dramatic even by baseball's standards. The largest
previous percentage jump was 47.7 percent in 1977, the first year following
free agency. Last season, salaries increased 20.2 percent, according to
figures compiled by the Players Association.;    "Obviously, we think this is
a problem," said Chuck O'Conner, the head of the owners' Player Relations
Committee. "I don't think you can look at this and say this is a situation
that's going to stabilize itself. It's not.";    If all this makes you think
baseball players are paid too much, you aren't alone.;    According to last
week's New York Times/CBS News Poll, those surveyed said by more than a
three-to-one margin (71 percent to 19 percent) that the typical player is paid
too much rather than just the right amount.;    Only 1 percent thought the
typical player is paid too little.  </TEXT>

FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Fall in a minor key - Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For this baseball fan, the season began with all the promise of a sunny
April afternoon. On opening day at Yankee Stadium, the home team put on a
display that signalled a year filled with tantalising possibilities.
Four months later, my summer ended on an ambivalent note, far away from the
top tier of the professional ranks, where play has been brought to a halt by
a player strike. At Skylands Park, 65 miles west of New York city, the New
Jersey Cardinals were showcasing the scrappy brand of baseball which
attracted thousands of new fans to 'minor league' ballparks this year.
This year was marked by a rebirth of sorts for the minor leagues, where
small-town clubs such as New Jersey helped fill the void left by the strike
for millions of disenfranchised fans.
The walkout - which involves players on the 28 teams which comprise the
American and National leagues - is in its fifth week. It has forced the
cancellation of hundreds of games. With only 23 days left in the regular
schedule, there is no agreement in sight.
The cessation of play could not have come at a worse time. Even if a
settlement is forthcoming, the strike has already spoiled a season in which
some of baseball's hallowed individual records were threatened for the first
time in decades.
The strike proved to be a windfall for the 200 or so minor league teams
which play in the relative obscurity of small cities and towns across the US
and Canada.
The main purpose of these 'farm' teams - most of which are independently
owned - is to cultivate young talent for the major leagues. In exchange for
an operating subsidy, each club fields players who can be moved around the
parent club's organisation at any time.
This year, the minor leagues carried their role to its logical conclusion.
The strike forced television networks that feature baseball as their
programming mainstay to turn in desperation to the farm system.
ESPN, the 24-hour sports channel, twice called on the Birmingham Barons of
the double-A (triple-A is the highest minor league level) Southern League to
fill embarrassing holes in its schedule. Why the Barons? Its left-fielder
happens to be a former professional basketballer by the name of Michael
Jordan.
Jordan's decision to try his hand at baseball this spring, brought a wave of
welcome publicity to the minors, but he deserves only a small part of the
credit for the farm system's season in the sun. After a long decline which
began in the 1960s, minor-league teams have been enjoying a steady
resurgence in popularity over the last few seasons.
In 1993, total attendance at minor-league games reached 32m, up from 10m in
the 1960s, when television introduced major-league action to the
hinterlands. Today, new minor-league ball parks such as Skylands are
springing up across the country, as local and state governments trip over
one another to entice franchises to their areas.
The reasons behind this resurgence are complex. In part, the farm teams have
benefited from a disenchantment with big league baseball which has been
bubbling just below the surface for years. The strike has further sullied
the image of a sport in which the median player salary is Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 322,600) and billionaire owners are suspected of cooking their books
to show operational losses.
As a consequence, young farm hands - who earn Dollars 1,400 a month plus
Dollars 18 a day in meal money - seem more like the idealised 'boys of
summer' than their big-league counterparts. Most minor leaguers support the
strike and, to a man, hope one day to make it to 'The Show'. But in the
friendly confines of a small stadium like Skylands, it is easy to imagine
the Cards are playing baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it. At least one
very rich Baron is certainly doing just that.
Economics has played a big role, too. Salaries are lower, and so are tickets
and refreshments. Families of average means - most of whom now live in the
suburbs - can enjoy professional baseball without the expense and
inconvenience of travelling to the big city.
At Skylands Park, the family event sphere seemed more like a county
fairground than a big-league ball-yard. The good-natured crowd was equally
divided between pre-teens - girls as well as boys - and their
thirtysomething parents. Beer drinkers were thin on the ground.
The atmosphere contrasted sharply with opening day at Yankee Stadium, where
players on the field had to compete for attention with the numerous brawls
which erupted in the grandstands.

LABOR: MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSN. DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH OTHER 
UNIONS, AND SALARIES ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE.

<P>
Last year, the average American labor union negotiated a contract that gave its 
members a 4% annual raise. 
</P>
<P>
This winter, nine baseball players signed multiyear contracts paying annual 
salaries of $3 million or better. One of them, Will Clark, now makes roughly 
170 times the median salary of a full-time American worker. 
</P>
<P>
That's merely the most obvious difference between the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn. and the rest of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's often-amended labor framework -- which the owners are now trying to 
change again with their threat of a spring training lockout -- is a world apart 
from traditionalAmerican industrial relations. 
</P>
<P>
Money is not the only reason that an $8-an-hour member of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers or the Service Employes International Union may feel less 
than complete solidarity with a fellow unionist such as pitcher Pascual Perez, 
who recently signed a $5.7-million, three-year contract with the New York 
Yankees after a 9-13 season with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
The very issues that consume most unions are different. Health benefits, not 
wages, is the most volatile subject in American labor. The number of strikes 
over management cutbacks in health benefits has tripled in the last three 
years, while unions have grudgingly grown used to pay increases that fall a bit 
below the pace of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"As a good union man, I should say we feel a lot of kinship, but personally I 
don't," says George Blunt, a teamster from Whittier who hasn't worked in five 
months after going on strike at a Los Angeles food warehouse. "For a guy making 
$2 million a year, a little medical bill isn't the problem it is to the average 
working man." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the prime responsibility of a union is to negotiate a master pay 
scale. In baseball, as well as the entire sports-entertainment segment of 
labor, the union negotiates only the minimum wage -- $68,000 a year in major 
league baseball. Above that floor, the player is worth whatever he and his 
agent can get from the club's owner. 
</P>
<P>
The logic behind this difference is that, unlike the typical worker, the 
athlete is not just an employee. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the product that's being sold," said Dick Moss, a baseball players' agent 
who was formerly general counsel to the players' union as well as associate 
general counsel to the United Steelworkers of America in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The determination of these salaries is another example of the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for most unionized workers are "uniform by job categories because, for 
the most part, the job skills the workers in these jobs have are on par with 
one another," said Lionel Sobel, a Loyola Law School professor who wrote a book 
about sports law. "The variations are hard for an employer to determine." 
</P>
<P>
As anyone who's ever participated in a rotisserie league can testify, employee 
variables in baseball are rampant, if not mind-boggling. They make job 
categories impossible, but they also make performance analysis much easier than 
trying to rate the work of, say, two dozen nurses. 
</P>
<P>
The increased use of computers in the workplace now allows employers to more 
easily quantify worker performance, from the number of calls an operator 
handles each hour to the number of minutes a warehouseman needs to fill a 
certain stock stock order. But unions, fearing that this data will be used 
punitively, have generally resisted basing wages on such individual 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the notion of seniority, so prized in the union shop, where 
gradations in pay are based on the belief that the longer you've been around, 
the more valuable you are? At Boeing, for example, machinists move up through 
121 labor grades and steps, ranging from $8.88 an hour to $18.42. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball stands such an idea on its head. Ask any 37-year-old utility infielder 
who took a pay cut after hitting .193. Or ask Steve Garvey, who at 38 wasn't 
offered a contract by the San Diego Padres after he had hit .211 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The workaday world certainly has its share of that kind of coldness. Unions 
complain increasingly that employers are pressuring workers in their 40s and 
50s into retirement to save medical and other fringe-benefit costs, and turning 
increasingly to younger or part-time workers. But sports -- particularly 
baseball, with its wealth of statistics -- makes such judgments even less 
forgivingly. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, director of UCLA's Institute of Industrial Relations, said 
that even the fundamental question of market value changes when ballplayers and 
workers are compared. 
</P>
<P>
"In routine collective bargaining, individuals are trying to get more than they 
would be worth (individually) in a free market," using the union's traditional 
implicit threat of a strike as leverage, Mitchell said. "In sports, players are 
trying to get what they're worth in the free market." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, baseball players have been regarded as a breed apart from other 
workers because their bosses -- the team owners -- were exempt from antitrust 
laws. This occurred because of what sports-law expert Sobel calls an accident 
of history. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1920s that baseball was exempt because it did 
not meet the definition of interstate commerce -- a definition that in 
subsequent decades has been substantially widened to include not merely 
manufactured goods but services as well. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But the control owners enjoyed over players -- restricting them to a certain 
team, robbing them of all bargaining rights -- began to evaporate in the 1970s 
with court rulings that created salary arbitration and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes have made the antitrust exemption largely irrelevant, according 
to Sobel and Jack Getman, another sports-law authority who teaches at the 
University of Texas law school. The current battle between the players and the 
owners, as well as the future ones, will be played out under the same federal 
labor laws that govern the rest of America's unions.

<P>
Question: Why is it called a lockout? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's seldom that an owner of a corporation locks the office doors and 
doesn't let the employees in. That's what is happening here. Baseball owners 
are refusing to let the players come to work unless a Basic Agreement 
(contract) is reached between the owners and the players' union 
representatives. The last agreement expired Dec. 31, 1989. If the players 
refused to report to spring training, it would be called a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is participating in the talks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Negotiators for the Major League Baseball Players Relation Committee (PRC), 
which represents the owners, and officials of the Major League Baseball 
Players' Assn. (MLBPA), which represents the players. Also, Baseball 
Commissioner Fay Vincent, who is hired and paid by the owners, joined the talks 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How quickly would it take players to get ready for the regular season if an 
agreement is reached? 
</P>
<P>
A: Spring training runs six weeks for pitchers, catchers and injured players 
and about five weeks for the position players. The consensus is that for 
position players, the least amount of spring-season training needed would be 
three weeks. But pitchers need almost the entire six weeks and would pitch 
fewer innings at the start of the season because of a lack of stamina. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How soon could camps open if an agreement is reached? 
</P>
<P>
A: Owner representatives say it would take about a week to prepare camps to 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why can't spring training camps open while the owners and players continue 
discussion? 
</P>
<P>
A: Seemingly, the players union would allow players to report to spring 
training while it continues negotiations with the owners. However, the owners 
want an agreement before the season begins, and are trying to ensure that by 
not opening spring training camps. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: The bulk of the money received by the owners comes from the 
telecast of postseason events. The owners receive that money toward the end of 
the season. The owners are fearful that if they start the season without a 
contract the players will wait until July or August and strike. By then, most 
of the players will have received the bulk of their annual salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The union says it will not forfeit its right to strike during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are the players paid? 
</P>
<P>
A: The majority of players are paid their salary during the regular season. 
Some players, though, elect to have their salary paid over a 26-week pay 
period. Players do not get paid for spring training, but do receive expense 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the entire agreement have to be in place before the owners open spring 
training? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to recent reports, no. Before Vincent joined the talks, the owners 
said that revenue sharing must be agreed to by the union before the owners will 
consider opening camps. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is revenue sharing? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners would use 48% of their revenue from ticket sales and television 
and radio rights -- which produce 82% of their total revenue -- for players' 
salaries and benefits. The revenue would be used to pay player salaries for 
players with one to six years of major league service, and would be shared 
equally by the 26 clubs. The salaries would be determined on a statistically 
based, pay-for-performance scale. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the salary cap? 
</P>
<P>
A: A condition of revenue sharing would impose a salary cap on each team. Free 
agents, players with at least six years of major league experience, could not 
sign with teams other than their own if those teams' payrolls were above the 
specified limit. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is revenue sharing so important to the owners? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners want "cost certainty." They want to know how much revenue to 
budget for salaries. They say revenue sharing isn't a means to ensure 
profitability for all 26 clubs, but the best way to put stability in their 
relationship with the players. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is the players union so opposed to revenue sharing? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners' pay-for-performance system, as originally proposed, would 
eliminate arbitration, which is currently available to players with three years 
of major league service or more. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, for players with one to six years of experience, it would eliminate 
guaranteed contracts and multiyear contracts that are executed when a player 
nears free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Third, salaries would be determined by statistical formulas based on numbers 
from the players' previous two seasons. The union believes a players' value 
cannot be measured on statistics alone. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the revenue-sharing conditions would impose a salary cap that could 
restrict mobility for free agents. Players with six years or more would still 
be free agents, but they could not sign with teams other than their own if 
those teams' payrolls were above the specified limit. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have the owners softened their stance? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's been reported that on Tuesday the owners modified their proposal to 
keep arbitration but place a 75% ceiling on the amount of increase a player can 
receive. The proposal would also dump the pay-for-performance system based on a 
statistical table for determining the salary of players with six or fewer years 
of major league service. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why can't the baseball commissioner stop this lockout? 
</P>
<P>
A: The commissioner, who is hired and paid by the owners, can use his influence 
to encourage a settlement. But he does not have authority over the players' 
union, and therefore cannot order an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about tickets purchased for the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are holding a ticket to a game and the game is not played, Dodger 
officials say you will be entitled to a refund. Procedures would be announced 
at the appropriate time.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: 49ers make the cap fit - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new American football year opens tomorrow, but if there was a prize for
the best performance during the off-season, the National Football League
would have crowned its champions already: the San Francisco 49ers.
Not because the 49ers had the best pre-season record. They won three out of
four games, but two teams, the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, went
undefeated in exhibition games.
But because of the team management's accomplishment in adding a formidable
group of talented veterans to one of the most highly-paid rosters in the
sport while keeping the payroll under the limit imposed by the NFL's new
salary cap.
The salary cap is the cause of the US professional baseball players' strike.
Unlike their counterparts in football, baseball players are not prepared to
accept a limit on their pay. The NFL players' union last year accepted a
ceiling on the total each team could pay its players in return for securing
free agency - which allows players to move teams after a certain period in
the league.
The difference between the NFL's salary cap and the cap proposed by the
baseball owners, is the flexibility of the NFL system. There is a lot of
'wiggle room' under the football cap, and no one has proved more adept at
wiggling than the 49ers.
At the end of last year, the team's total payroll exceeded Dollars 40m. It
seemed that they had to reduce salaries and / or shed players to fit under
the Dollars 34.6m (Pounds 22m) cap the NFL had set for the 1994 season.
Today, however, the 49ers have all their top players from last year on
long-term contracts, including stars such as quarterback Steve Young and
wide receiver Jerry Rice. And they have five new players, each an
established NFL star - on extended contracts. Yet the 49ers team payroll has
dropped from more than Dollars 40m to Dollars 34.59m, just under the salary
cap.
How did they do it? They started late last year by hurriedly signing several
key players to lucrative 'front-loaded' long-term contracts, which paid the
players a lot of money for the 1993 season, and considerably less for
subsequent ones. By paying out so much money in 1993, before the cap came
into effect, the 49ers left themselves considerable room to sign new players
for 1994, year-one of the salary cap.
In basketball - the other sport with an existing salary cap - teams have
fallen foul of the league authorities with this kind of creative accounting,
but in football, the wiggle room leaves plenty of scope for creativity. As
Carmen Policy, president of the 49ers, put it: 'We wanted to be the hunters,
not the hunted. We wanted to do what we could to manipulate the system,
rather than have it control us.'
After anchoring many of their best players to the team, the 49ers went
hunting. They bagged several top free agents, including Super Bowl winners
Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys and Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, and
veterans Rickey Jackson of the New Orleans Saints and Bart Oates of the New
York Giants. It was no coincidence that all of the new signings were
defenders, for the defence has been the chief weakness of the
attack-oriented 49ers for the past few seasons.
Some of the money needed to pay the newcomers came from the release of
well-paid reserve players, including Steve Bono, the back-up quarterback who
so often deputised for injured stars such as Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Also, the 49ers chose to hire a lot of relatively cheap 'rookie' players
fresh from university teams.
The result is a well-balanced team, a favourite to reach the Super Bowl in
January. The only likely obstacle is the defending champions, the Cowboys,
who beat the 49ers in the last two National Football Conference finals. The
Cowboys, however, have lost their coach, Jimmy Johnson and several leading
players including Norton.
Yet, the 49ers' policy of squeezing so much expensive talent under the
salary cap involves a risk. Because the 49ers have let go so many veteran
reserves and replaced them with mostly untested players, a team that was
once renowned for its 'depth' now has little insurance if its stars get
injured. And in the NFL, that is quite a gamble.

<CAPTION>  Photo, diagram; PHOTO: Bo Jackson; ... Hip injury; DIAGRAM: Ron Coddington --
Mercury News Source: The Merck Manual, Gray's Anatomy and The American Medical
Association Family Medical Guide.; Bo's injury; Jackson, who sustained an
injury to his left hip in the AFC playoffs Jan. 13, is suffering from the
early development of avascular necrosis at the femur head, said Kansas City
Royals' physician Steve Joyce. "The loss of cartilage in Bo's case exceeds
what is normally seen in the early stages of avascular necrosis," Joyce said.
Terms; Avascular: Lacking in blood vessels or having a poor blood supply.;
Necrosis: Death of areas of tissue or bone surrounded by healthy parts.;
Sequestrium: Dead part in bone.; Outlook; There is no collapse of the hip
joint at this point, Dr. James Andrew said. However, further deterioration
eventually could result in a hip replacement.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  INJURY; REPORT; BASEBALL; FOOTBALL; PROFESSIONAL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Kansas City Royals took a stunning step Monday, placing Bo Jackson, the
oft-injured two-sport star, on unconditional-release waivers.;    "We felt
this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most
equitable to all involved," Kansas City General Manager Herk Robinson said.
"We got nearly $2.5 million involved in a situation like this; finances do
enter into a situation like this."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The move came amid unconfirmed reports that Jackson would not be able to
play baseball or football again because of complications after an injury to
his left hip suffered playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in an NFL playoff
game Jan. 13.;    Jackson said Monday that he believes he will be able to play
baseball this season. "Don't count me out," said Jackson, 28.;    Jackson, who
has played professional baseball and professional football in the same year
for four years and has been injured in each sport in each of those years, has
a contract for the 1991 baseball season for $2,375,000.;    By releasing him
now, the Royals said they would owe him only 30 days' termination pay, which
computes to $395,833, a savings for the club of $1,979,167. Their ability to
release him now, though, was challenged by Eugene Orza, associate general
counsel of the Players Association.;    A club cannot release a player if he
is injured as a result of a baseball mishap.;    "Their claim, I guess, is
that there is an inability to play because of an injury incurred outside
baseball," Orza said. But he added, "I can't imagine that they didn't know he
was injured in football when he signed their contract. After he was injured
and before he signed, he reported to the Royals' team physician.";   
According to a report from the Royals' team physician, Steve Joyce, "special
X-ray studies" were performed on Jackson last month and they "confirmed the
loss of joint cartilage space and the development of early avascular necrosis
of the femoral head.";    "The loss of cartilage in Bo's case exceeds what is
normally seen in the early stages of avascular necrosis," the report
continued.;    Joyce said Jackson asked him not to tell the club about the
severity of the outfielder's hip injury following the tests in February.;   
"I did examine Bo prior to the arbitration hearing, and I did inform the
Royals' trainer," Joyce said. "But Bo did ask me not to speak to Royals
management. It was a balancing act between being realistic with the Royals and
being positive with the patient.";    Whether or not he plays football in
1991, the Raiders are under contract to pay Jackson $1,617,500, which includes
his salary, signing bonus and reporting bonus.;  WAIVER RULES;    (box) WAIVER
PERIOD: It lasts 72 hours, so Jackson could be clear at 11 a.m. PST Friday. A
team that claims Jackson has to pay $1 and his 1991 salary of $2.375 million.
Preference is given to American League teams in reverse order of their 1990
record and then to National League teams in the same order.;    (box) FREE
AGENT: If no team claims Jackson, he becomes a free agent. The Royals would
have to pay one-sixth of his 1991 salary, about $395,000.;    -- Kansas City

<P>
So your head spins every time you think of how much money major league baseball 
players are making. 
</P>
<P>
You say these players have lost touch with reality when it comes to judging 
their true value. 
</P>
<P>
You share the popular notion that these grown men are playing a kid's game and 
should be grateful they get to spend their summers lounging in the sun, doing 
what the rest of us mortals only wish we could do for money. 
</P>
<P>
Well, let's put aside emotions for a while and examine the cold, hard facts. 
You may be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
You may learn that, if anything, baseball players are underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, baseball owners, most of whom are shrewd businessmen, toss money at 
their players the way we toss a sawbuck to our kids for their weekly 
allowances. It's as if each day another player becomes the highest paid in 
baseball. It was Will Clark's turn recently. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it may be some other guy. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't as if the owners don't know what they're doing. They know exactly 
what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason they do it is simple, really. 
</P>
<P>
Without the players, the owners wouldn't be making their astronomical profits. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that, as a group, the players are earning a perfectly 
reasonable percentage of what they generate. And the owners know it. 
</P>
<P>
This is easily detectable when one figures out the way the baseball pie is 
sliced. 
</P>
<P>
The 624 men on the rosters of baseball's 26 major league clubs generate about 
five times as much money as they earn. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the four-year, $1.5-billion total contracts that baseball signed with 
CBS and ESPN. That alone brings in $375 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Let's conservatively estimate that local television and radio contracts bring 
in another $150 million a year for the 26 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
And let's say gate receipts bring in an additional $685 million a year, based 
on 81 home games and average attendance of 25,000 spectators, paying an average 
of $13 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Concessions, programs and other such income producing devices bring in another 
$316 million, based on $6 a fan. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the clubs together earn about $100 million or so in merchandise 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
All told, these 624 men, who together are major league baseball, will generate 
$1.65 billion in gross revenue for the owners. 
</P>
<P>
That, on average, means each player is responsible for generating about $2.6 
million in direct revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that to the $550,000 or so that the average major leaguer will earn in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball still ranks very much as an owner's market. 
</P>
<P>
So why do the salaries of baseball players cause so much controversy? 
</P>
<P>
It probably has more to do with their public images than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Gripes from Joe Consumer, after all, aren't nearly as frequent about the 
salaries of entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
It is uncommon to hear people saying that Dolly Parton, Tom Cruise or Sammy 
Davis Jr. make outrageous sums of money. Jack Nicholson will make more than $60 
million for his role as the Joker in "Batman." And some of us didn't even 
consider it a very good movie. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's generally accepted that these performers paid their dues to reach 
the salary levels they enjoy today. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players, however, are generally perceived as spoiled and pampered 
prima donnas. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that most baseball players resemble overaged adolescents -- 
and we all know that adolescents with a lot of money can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players are likely to fight among themselves. They whine about their 
playing time, or which positions their managers want them to play. Some develop 
never before revealed injuries to explain their ways out of slumps. And a few 
only seem to produce in the option years of their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, baseball players have been known to directly insult the 
very fans who pay their bills, advising in some cases that they kiss their 
wallets. 
</P>
<P>
Some players are not averse to reminding Joe Consumer that, in the world of 
baseball, beating rush-hour traffic means getting out of bed at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how much the players irk the fans, however, the truth is that the 
game is adored. 
</P>
<P>
And that translates into sizable crowds and revenue in most major league 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
And that, in turn, means the players have incredible bargaining leverage -- 
like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that salaries in baseball probably will continue to rise. 
And, until these players grow up to be the role models that society thinks they 
should be, so will the fan's blood pressure.

ANGELS SIGN LANGSTON TO BASEBALL'S RICHEST CONTRACT

The California Angels boldly pursued and won baseball's premier free agent 
Friday when left-handed pitcher Mark Langston agreed to a guaranteed, 
five-year, $16-million contract that made him -- at least for the moment -- the 
highest-paid player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old San Diego native spurned "serious" proposals from the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees to enlist with the Angels, becoming the 
sixth starting pitcher on a staff that last season had the second-best 
earned-run average in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's contract, which will contain a no-trade clause, will be the longest 
given a professional baseball player since Eddie Murray signed a five-year pact 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 (Murray subsequently was traded to the 
Dodgers) and is the most lucrative guaranteed contract ever, surpassing the 
$13.6 million Dave Winfield was guaranteed by the Yankees in a 10-year deal 
before the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston also becomes baseball's third $3-million man, joining Minnesota's 
Kirby Puckett and Oakland's Rickey Henderson in that elite group. He will get a 
$1.5-million signing bonus, a 1990 salary of $1.5 million and a salary of $3.25 
million in each of the succeeding four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out to break ground in that regard," said Langston, the Angels' 
biggest free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson joined the club in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the dollar amounts discussed "without a doubt boggles the 
mind," security was paramount in Langston's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams were close, like the Dodgers and Yankees, but I think from the 
start -- from the very first meeting with the Angels -- meeting with (owners) 
Mr. and Mrs. (Gene and Jackie) Autry, the Angels were first-class, and from 
that point on, they took the lead," said Langston, who had a combined record of 
16-14 last season with the Seattle Mariners and Montreal Expos and has a career 
record of 86-76. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more comfortable with the situation they presented before me as far as 
the five-year deal and the no-trade provision. That's something that was very 
important to me. Every time we (he and agent Arn Tellem) said something, they 
responded. They were the front-runner as far as responding to everything we had 
to say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern was playing for a pennant-contending team," he said. "Even 
when I played for Seattle, I thought the Angels were classy and I always liked 
playing in Anaheim. I knew every year they would do what it took to put a 
winning team on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port, who in the past has been criticized for not 
aggressively pursuing free agents, said signing Langston will give him more 
options in trade discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant in the past to sign players for longer than two years, Port made an 
exception because of Langston's ability and the knowledge that another starter 
might have averted the late-season collapse that took the Angels out of the AL 
West race last summer. 
</P>
<P>
* DEALING AN ACE 
</P>
<P>
Langston is delighted but the Dodgers are disappointed by Angels' latest 
acquisition.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Pitching for the market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an odd kind of labour dispute. On one side is a strong union,
insisting that its members' salaries be set by market forces. Their bosses
say wages must be capped, so that profitable employers can subsidise
loss-making ones. Meanwhile, pundits muse that resolving the strike would
save the presidency.
For millions of US baseball fans, the six-week-old major league baseball
strike is certainly different. It ruined this year's regular playing season.
Now it has put paid to one of the high points of the American sporting year,
the World Series, cancelled on Wednesday for the first time since 1904. But
non-enthusiasts should also take note. The wrangle over top players' pay is
a good example of how market forces work in the modern labour market. The
team owners are essentially an old-fashioned cartel trying to tilt the
system back in their fav-our.
At first glance, it is the players' side that looks outdated. In a country
in which only about 12 per cent of private sector workers are unionised, the
Major League Baseball Players Association's ability to bring the industry to
its knees sounds more like the 'big labor' of the 1950s and 1960s than the
'flexible' US labour market of the 1990s.
But the players' strong bargaining position does not come from membership of
the union. In the US, unlike many other countries, employers may hire
permanent replacements for striking employees. A bill which would have
banned this failed to pass Congress earlier this year. Quite apart from the
probable public reaction, however, the owners cannot do this because many of
the players are all but irreplaceable.
In effect, the team owners are facing a dilemma common to many US and UK
shareholders. Greater labour market deregulation helps to push down the cost
of unskilled workers. At the same time, however, a core group of highly
skilled employees in each firm is able to demand a lot more.
Baseball players, once little more than a team's indentured servants after
signing their first contract, won more individual rights in the courts in
the 1970s. Salaries have risen ever since: from an average of Dollars
400,000 to over Dollars 1.2m in the past five years. Wages now account for
58 per cent of total industry revenues.
The teams argue that the cost of bidding for the best players is driving the
smaller, less popular, teams in the league out of business. They would like
to see the overall wage bill capped at only 50 per cent of revenues. They
say that the resulting extra profits would be used to bail out the teams
that are in trouble.
It is not up to the players to allow the companies to be so collectively
minded. Even if it were, one cannot judge whether such cross-subsidisation
is even necessary, since all of the teams' finances are shrouded in secrecy.
In fact, since the owners are possibly the only US businessmen to be
entirely exempt from anti-trust provisions, they may make any agreement they
like, without outside interference. On Wednesday evening, President Clinton
rightly suggested that this cosy cartel should be reconsidered. The baseball
strike is a market failure, which stems from the cartel and not from the
players.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: Struck out on the field of dreams - Patrick Harverson
says a players' strike is ludicrous and should be banned / Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Lexington Avenue express is not the only means of getting to Yankee
Stadium, but it is by far the most satisfying. The subway train rumbles
through Harlem and under the Bronx River to emerge blinking into the
sunlight alongside the great ballpark. As the train pulls into the 161st
Street station, the appetite is whetted by a tantalising glimpse between the
stands of the lush grass in rightfield.
As I stepped off the train last week, I experienced the familiar rush of
excitement as thousands of other baseball fans walked up River Avenue to
join the long lines at the ticket booths. The division-leading Yankees, who
this season have been playing their best baseball in 13 years, were at home
to the Cleveland Indians, and Yankee Stadium seemed the perfect place to be
in New York on a warm Saturday afternoon in mid-summer.
At Dollars 11.50 a seat, watching the Yankees is not cheap, but for that you
get an upper deck seat in the sun, three or more hours of major league
baseball, and a big, lovely slice of history.
Yankee Stadium is not just any old sports ground. It is known as 'The House
that Ruth Built', after the great Babe Ruth, whose exploits attracted the
huge crowds which ultimately paid for the stadium's construction. When it
opened in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the wonder of the sports world, with its
imposing entrance and spectacular two-tier stands. It remains so today, even
after a mid-1970s facelift that changed much of the way it looks but which,
thankfully, left history intact.
The seats high in the upper deck afforded a splendid view. As the Yankee
players jogged out for the opening inning against Cleveland, the bright
white of their uniforms sparkled against the green of the outfield and the
brown earth of the diamond-shaped basepaths. While the outfielders languidly
tossed balls around as they awaited the arrival of the Indians' first
batter, I bought a hot dog from one of the vendors who roam the stands
shouting 'Dawgs - Who Wants Dawgs?' in mustard-thick accents.
Yet my enjoyment of the game was marred by the certain knowledge that the
Yankees' great run of 1994 was heading for a premature end. This was not
because I had had some premonition that the team was going to stop playing
the smart, unfussy baseball that had taken it to the top of the table, but
because I knew the team was going to stop playing, full stop.
Just days before the Cleveland game, the players' union had announced plans
for an indefinite strike, starting on August 12, to protest against the
baseball owners insistence on including in the new labour contract a salary
cap - a limit on the total amount each team can pay its players.
The owners, who have been unable to agree among themselves on how to divide
baseball's revenues so that the clubs in smaller cities such as Milwaukee,
Pittsburgh and San Diego are not forced into extinction trying to compete
with the wealthy, big-spending clubs in cities such as New York, Chicago,
and Los Angeles, view the salary cap as a way of controlling their
rapidly-escalating costs. The players regard the cap as an infringement of
the free market and oppose pay limits.
Yesterday, the union made good on its threat, and the 1994 season - so far a
marvellous one, full of promise, not just for the Yankees but for other
teams, and for several players who are poised to break some of baseball's
oldest records - came to an inglorious halt.
The strike is maddening. Irrespective of the merits, or otherwise, of the
players' actions, there is something ludicrous about millionaire sportsmen
striking against multi-millionaire owners in an argument over money.
As anyone who watches a game or reads the sports pages knows, there is
plenty of money in baseball. The average salary for a player is Dollars 1.2m
(Pounds 770,000) a year. Revenues from attendance, television contracts and
merchandising total almost Dollars 2bn a year. And the 28 teams of Major
League Baseball are estimated to be worth a combined Dollars 2.5bn. With
that much money swilling around, it is remarkable that a way cannot be found
to share the bounty of America's national game.
Not only is the strike ludicrous, but there should be a law against it.
Indeed, were it any other US sport there would be: earlier this summer,
baseball managed to fight off an attempt in Congress to overturn its
precious, and unique, exemption from anti-trust laws. Both the owners and
the players have overlooked something important in their dispute: the fans.
It is they, after all, who pay everyone's wages.
This may be a cliche, but it is true. The players are not paid millions of
dollars because a home run, a strike, or a great catch are of themselves
valuable commodities. Gold, oil, copper - these are valuable commodities. A
home run is valuable because people are willing to pay to see it happen,
either in the flesh or on television. If people were not willing to pay to
watch big league baseball, players could hit all the home runs they wanted
but would still never earn a cent.
Everyone in the business of baseball is party to a three-sided contract
between the players, the owners, and the fans. The players have broken that
contract. The owners are equally culpable for having made such a hash of
their own affairs. The fans should sue.
If they do not sue (and this being America, someone probably will), fans
will be left to do what they spend much of the year doing anyway - moaning
about the greedy players and greedier owners. A few were energised enough
this week to plan a fans' strike, but little came of it. Why? Because fans -
the poor pathetic things they are - love baseball, even if baseball does not
love them. Thursday was the last chance to see a game before the shutters
came down, and hundreds of thousands paid to do just that.
Now the baseball bats are silent. Yankee Stadium should have been alive this
Saturday with the sound of 40,000 fans cheering on their team against the
world champions from Toronto. Instead, the great ballpark will be deserted.
And the Lexington express from Manhattan will rumble past almost empty. All
that will be on offer at Yankee Stadium is that inviting glimpse of the
lush, green grass in rightfield.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport in the US: Three strikes, you're all out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, a glorious major league baseball season ended prematurely when a
strike by players closed the game down after they failed to agree with the
owners on how to divide the sport's billion-dollar revenues.
Now, a similar dispute over revenue-sharing between ice hockey players and
the management of the National Hockey League is about to lead to the
postponement of this weekend's opening of the 1994-95 season. Barring a
last-minute reprieve, the season that was supposed to cement ice hockey's
position as the fastest-growing and most fashionable sport in America will
be put on temporary hold.
To lose one professional sport to a labour dispute may be regarded as a
misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness. But what if three were
lost? There is a possibility - a slim one, admittedly - that the coming
basketball season may be disrupted by the failure of the players and the
league to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The players'
union and owners have already tangled in the courts over pay and other
issues, and the dispute could yet culminate in a lockout.
If the National Basketball Association season were interrupted before the
year's end, the only professional team sport left would be American
football. But even in the National Football League, all is not well. Both
players and team bosses are struggling to come to terms with life under the
NFL's new salary cap - the league-wide ceiling on team pay that the players'
union and management accepted for the first time this year.
In order to keep team pay within the cap, clubs have been forced to jettison
veterans or cut their salaries dramatically, and put their faith in a
larger-than-usual number of untested young players. This has made a lot of
players and team managers unhappy. Many now wish they had never agreed to
the salary cap.
What is so frustrating for the fans, is that baseball, football, basketball
and ice hockey are all extraordinarily successful sports. The players are
paid hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars, the owners earn vast
sums from television contracts, attendance and merchandising, and the
individual franchises - the clubs - are each valued at anything between
Dollars 50m and Dollars 200m.
Yet, it is the very financial success of American sports that is at the root
of the problems.
The country's four biggest team sports have become huge cash-generating
businesses. Exact figures on earnings are not available (primarily because
the owners want to keep the players in the dark), but according to Financial
World magazine, baseball last year generated annual revenues of
approximately Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.07bn), football Dollars 1.5bn,
basketball Dollars 1bn, and ice hockey Dollars 680m.
These totals are considerably understated, because they do not include
earnings from the sale of sports merchandise, which is controlled by the
leagues. Clothing and hats bearing team logos and colours are so popular in
America and overseas that revenues from merchandising range from Dollars
800m in ice hockey to Dollars 2.5bn in football.
All of this would be great news for everyone, if only the players and owners
could agree on how to share the booty. There is a single issue at the heart
of the labour-management disputes in baseball, ice hockey, basketball and
football: how best to divide the spoils. More specifically: although
revenues in each sport have been rising steadily since the early 1980s,
player salaries have been rising even faster, and the owners, who have
fuelled the rise with their eagerness to pay ever increasing amounts to star
players, want to put a stop to it. To limit the rise in salaries and keep
more of the revenues for themselves, the owners in each sport have either
imposed, or are seeking to impose, a salary cap on the teams.
The players, naturally, do not like the idea of accepting a limit on what
they earn. In those sports where a cap is demanded by the owners (baseball
and ice hockey), the players refuse to accept it - hence the strike and the
lockout. In those sports with a cap (football and basketball), the players
want to get rid of it - hence all the unhappiness and potential unrest.
There is another factor behind the dire labour relations in American sports:
the changing natures of players and owners.
Today's sports stars are different from the heroes of the past: they are
much better-paid; they are less loyal to any one team; they are advised by a
legion of agents, lawyers and accountants; and they are members of stronger
unions. Players want their share of the spoils, and are willing to fight for
it.
The owners have changed greatly over the years, too. Today, they are likely
to have fewer ties to the local community, be less respectful of tradition
and more interested in making a profit. They are also less willing to share
the revenues among each other for 'the good of the game', and more willing
to stand up to the players.
The result is more confrontation, and less compromise.
Finding common ground between the two sides will not be easy. Some of the
country's best minds have struggled with the issues that crippled the
baseball season, but no one has come up with a remedy. The commissioner of
ice hockey is a clever, level-headed lawyer, yet he is ready to close down
the sport just when it is on the verge of winning over a new generation of
fans.
Instead the owners and players will direct their highly-developed
competitive instincts to beating each other, even if they risk losing
everything else in the process.

   We're having some pretty good baseball pennant races this season and that's fortunate, because we might not have any next year. 
I'm not just talking about pennant races. 
I'm talking about a season, too. 

   The labor contract between the team owners and players expires before the 1990 campaign, and while the two sides have yet to begin bargaining in earnest over a renewal, ominous rumblings already have been heard. 
They began last winter when the owners sought, and in many cases obtained, clauses in new multiyear player contracts that would excuse them from payments for the duration of a lockout. 

   And in July, the owners moved to define the ground for the coming confrontation by setting out a "concept" -- which looks for all the world like a proposal -- that would eliminate salary arbitration, one of the twin engines of ballplayer prosperity over the last 15 years, in favor of a pay-for-performance pool, and place new limitations on the other engine, free agency. 

   The notions were part of a memorandum that owners' representatives presented at a July 19 meeting. 
The session was supposed to be secret, but, naturally, didn't stay that way long. 
Likewise, while the two sides agreed not to discuss the matter's substance, they've done a bit of that, too, and the sound from the players' side doesn't suggest applause. 

   The upshot, says lawyer Donald Fehr, the players' union head, is that the odds for a strife-free settlement are "no better than 50-50." 
He adds: "I'm hopeful we can wrap things up in time to open the training camps next February, but I can't name a reason why I feel that way." 

   And while Fehr notes that his side's proposals in the coming talks probably will be less ambitious than the owners', and that the word "strike" has yet to pass his lips, the players aren't free of complaint. 
"Our older members went through three years of owner collusion on free-agent salaries, and the younger guys, with less than the three years' service it takes to get to arbitration, aren't being treated terribly well. 
A lot of resentment has built up." 

   In some industries it might be unusual for management to play the aggressor's role in labor bargaining, but not baseball. 
The players have had the upper hand since 1975, when the owners unwisely agreed to arbitrate a dispute over contract duration that went to the heart of the game's "reserve clause," which long had bound players to clubs until they chose to trade or release them. 
An arbitrator ruled in the players' favor, opening the era of free agency and sending salaries zooming. 

   In contract rounds since, the clubs have succeeded to some extent in stemming that trend, albeit at considerable cost. 
The 50-day strike that chopped the 1981 season off at the knees was waged over owner insistence on "warm body" (i.e., active-player) compensation for lost free agents, a plan that proved so unsatisfactory that it later was junked. 
A one-day strike the last time around, in 1985, ended in a pact that included an increase in arbitration eligibility to three years' service from two. 

   But none of those things, or the collusion on free-agent pay offers for which the owners were adjudged guilty for the 1986 and '87 seasons (a fine of $10.5 million was levied for 1986; testimony about the 1987 damage award and charges regarding 1988 still are being heard), have prevented the average player's salary from climbing to $522,000 this season from $371,000 in '85, and about $50,000 in the pre-emancipation 1975 campaign. 
Thus, the present "concepts." 

   Briefly, the owners want to create a common revenue pool out of which all players with between zero and six years of service would be paid. 
Salaries would be apportioned on the basis of individual performance statistics. 
The plan would eliminate not only salary arbitration but also another prime owner bugaboo -- player agents -- for that group. 

   Players with more than six years' service still would be eligible for free agency, but other clubs could bid for them only if their total payrolls were below certain levels. 
On the other hand, clubs with below-average payrolls would be required to increase theirs. 

   The owners made it clear they advanced the salary-pool idea with reluctance; one owner's rep was quoted as saying some clubs regarded this whiff of socialism as "philosophically revolting." 
From the players' side has come the observation that basing pay in the 0-6 year group solely on individual stats might subvert the game's emphasis on team success. 

   And Fehr expresses a common negotiator's concern with the bottom line. 
"We'd judge any owners' proposal by whether it would make us better or worse off than under our present deal," he says. 
"A big problem here is that owner collusion has prevented us from seeing how the last contract really works. 
We might want a few more years to give it a chance." 

   Fehr goes on to say that the players will have their own shopping list when talks start. 
A higher minimum salary (it's $68,000 now) or other ways to improve the lot of the under-three-years group will be sought. 
So will larger pensions for former and present players, although with levels for the latter group bumping the legal maximum, he says the matter "isn't cosmic." 

   The union wants to increase team rosters from the present 24 players, and put limits on a team's ability to maneuver players in and out of the minor leagues in ways that have increased the true arbitration-eligibility term to four years in many cases, he says. 
Fehr says he knows that Joe Fan is unlikely to be sympathetic to the union's highly paid members if his baseball-watching pleasure is curtailed, yet he urges some perspective. 
"Sure, the players earn a lot, but they've had the good luck to work in an extraordinarily profitable industry," he asserts. 

   Further, he suggests that when pondering the circumstances of a $500,000-a-year player, the fan should recall George Argyros, who bought the lowly Seattle Mariners in 1981 for $13 million and sold them this year, still lowly, for a reported $77 million. 
"As a club owner," he reminds us, "George never had a good year."

Arbitrator to Rule Fair or Foul on
Lack of Interest in Bids for Players

   On Aug. 31, an arbitrator will hand down a ruling that could eventually tilt the economic balance of power in baseball and other professional team sports. 

   Arbitrator Thomas Roberts will decide whether the owners of the 26 major league baseball teams conspired after the 1985 season to prevent players from marketing their services freely, in violation of the collective bargaining agreement that governs the sport's labor relations. 

   If the players win, it could cost the owners plenty. 
If the owners win, it would strengthen their ability to control salaries and render meaningless the concept of free agency -- which lets athletes with six years of major-league experience offer their services to the highest bidder when their contracts expire. 

   The decision could spark litigation by either side, and the whole mess may fester until 1989, when owners and players thrash out a new pact in what promises to be bitter negotiations. 

   After 32 hearing days spread over the past year and 6,000 pages of testimony, many in professional sports are anxiously awaiting the ruling. 
The National Football League and the National Basketball Association are conducting tough labor negotiations in which free agency is a major sticking point. 
They have discouraged it thus far by allowing players' old teams to keep them by matching rival bids. 

   Mr. Roberts's decision probably won't provide an instant resolution, but it should set the tone for future battles. 

   "It's the most important decision since the Messersmith-McNally case," says Randal Hendricks, a Houston lawyer and agent, referring to the 1975 grievances by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Andy Messersmith and Baltimore Orioles pitcher Dave McNally that led to free agency in 1976. 
It has been a bitter issue ever since. 

   After baseball owners opened up the market and bid feverishly for players, the average salary boomed to $412,520 from $51,501 in 1976. 
Owners now are howling about unprecedented losses that they say jeopardize the game's economic stability. 

   After the 1985 season, the free-agent market closed up like a clam. 
In the past two off-seasons, only two top-quality free agents changed uniforms. 
Andre Dawson, who left the Montreal Expos for the Chicago Cubs, and Lance Parrish, who went to the Philadelphia Phillies from the Detroit Tigers, accepted contracts that offered less than their original teams did. 

   Meanwhile, Detroit's Kirk Gibson, an ascendant young slugger, and Jack Morris, the winningest pitcher of the 1980s, and Montreal's Tim Raines, last year's National League batting champion, didn't receive offers exceeding their teams' bids. 
Bob Horner of the Atlanta Braves fled to Japan when nobody met his price. 

   Agents and union leaders claimed conspiracy was afoot. 
They filed one grievance on behalf of those who pursued free agency after the 1985 season, and another for the 1986 group. 
The alleged conspiracy, the union and agents claim, has been led by Peter Ueberroth, the economy-minded commissioner who came to baseball in 1984 after transforming the Olympic Games from a big money loser into a model of sports marketing. 

   After Mr. Ueberroth's arrival, coincidence piled upon coincidence. 

   All 26 teams decided they could get by with 24 players, instead of the 25 allowed. 
All 26 decided that player contracts beyond three years were counterproductive. 
And all 26 determined to end their pursuit of free agents and concentrate on developing minor-league prospects. 

   Were the decisions made by each team as "an individual matter" for "its own benefit," as required in the labor pact? 
For a fractious lot, such unanimity seemed far-fetched. 

   What about meetings where Mr. Ueberroth lectured owners on the fiscal foolishness of high-priced free agents? 
What about reports prepared by the owners' Player Relations Council that purported to show that the big-bucks, long-term contracts that came with the free-agent frenzy led to poor performance and wasted money? 
Is that proof of a conspiracy? 

   The commissioner's office has denied any collusion, but Mr. Hendricks said, "It's obvious there is tremendous peer-group pressures among owners and a clearinghouse being run out of league headquarters in New York." 

   If the owners were playing fair, says Don Fehr, executive director of the players union, there would be a market. 
"Even if prices fell, you would have competition at the market price," he reasons. 
"Nobody wanted Jack Morris for $8.50, either." 

   Barry Rona, executive director of the Player Relations Council, says owners have every right to decide against bidding for costly free agents and to discuss issues of mutual economic interest. 
That, he says, is all the teams have done. 

   "If Ford announces a price increase and General Motors thinks it's stupid, they have a right to say so," he said. 

   Mr. Roberts must decide which side is interpreting the collective bargaining agreement correctly, as George Nicolau must do on the second grievance. 

   Which brings up another complication: Mr. Nicolau inherited his grievance when owners fired Mr. Roberts in the midst of last summer's hearings. 
Mr. Rona says Mr. Roberts was fired because owners were outraged over a ruling in which he voided drug-testing clauses in contracts. 
Mr. Fehr says it was a stall tactic. 

   Yet another arbitrator ruled that Mr. Roberts couldn't be removed until he completed his present slate of grievances. 
Having started in 1974, he remains baseball's most senior salary arbitrator. 

   About a week's worth of testimony has been heard in the second arbitration case, with hearings scheduled to resume Monday. 
To many, that case is stronger, because of the higher quality of available free agents. 

   Also, "none of the 1985 free agents played out the string," says Robert Berry, a Boston University sports-law specialist. 
They signed before Jan. 8, 1986, after which their old team wouldn't have been allowed to re-sign them until May 1, almost a month into the season. 
That was designed to encourage rival offers, but several 1986 free agents went through the barrier and still struck out. 

   No one is betting on the outcome of the cases, but both sides are predicting victory. 
If players prevail, baseball insiders and legal specialists expect Mr. Roberts to order salary arbitration to determine how much the affected players were damaged by the collusion. 

   "One way or another, you have to come up with a big pile of money," says Jan Stiglitz, associate dean of the California Western School of Law in San Diego and a labor and sports specialist. 
"If the owners are burned enough by the amount, the market may open up." 

   But Tom Reich, an agent for 80 major leaguers, including Mr. Raines, says bringing players up to market value doesn't constitute enough of an economic sanction to worry owners. 

   "They would be afraid of a federal court action seeking $1 billion." 
He expects a "great wave of litigation" for damages, if the ruling is in the players' favor. 

   Mr. Rona says Mr. Roberts could prohibit the Player Relations Council from disclosing details of one team's offer to another team. 
Does Mr. Rona offer such services presently? 

   "Not as a course of action, generally, but I usually know and if someone were to ask me, I would have no hesitation in telling them," he said. 

   Many fear that an effective remedy doesn't exist. 
"There's not much he (Mr. Roberts) can do to compel owners to bid," says Gary Roberts, a Tulane University law professor who specializes in sports labor and antitrust law. 

   If the owners win, it "would force a player to stay with his old team on their terms -- a shorter contract with less money," says Mr. Hendricks, the agent. 
"Once they do that, they'll attack us on salary arbitration next." 

   That isn't all, Prof. Berry suggests. 
A management triumph would serve as "an invitation to owners in all sports to use various devices such as this to drastically cut back salaries."

DON'T EXPECT BASEBALL SALARIES TO HIT THE ROOF IN THE 1990S, AGENT SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Projecting astronomical salaries for major league baseball players in the 1990s 
based on this year's advent of the sport's first $3 million men will result in 
overinflated guesses, according to a player agent. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, whose clients include Lance Parrish and Brian Downing of the Angels, 
said it's unrealistic to expect that salaries will continue to increase at the 
pace they skyrocketed between 1988 and '89, because the end of collusion made 
this year unique. Salaries and revenues will be higher in the '90s, Reich 
predicted, but the escalation won't proceed at a breathtaking pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should project (1990s salaries) based on a percentage or proportion of 
the increase from last year to this (year), because this is a four-year 
catch-up from a price fix," said Reich, who declined to speculate on exact 
salaries or averages in the coming decade. "Like after a wage or price freeze, 
legal or illegal, there's a catch-up period and that's what we're having now. 
That doesn't mean we won't get some increases, but we're not going to get the 
same kind (of escalation) like last year to this . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A bankable star, whether in music, movies, TV or sports, is going to get his 
price and always will. The salaries of megastars will go up, but franchises 
will have higher value, too. What I do think we'll see is a revenue deal, 
revenue sharing between the players and owners cutting up that big, fat, 
opulent pie. TV revenues are going to go up; the potential of pay-per-view is 
staggering. Could you imagine what they could get if pay-per-view sold the 
World Series around the world? 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a relationship between revenues and salary since free 
agency. Before, the owners kept all the money. Now, the players get their cut. 
There's a direct correlation between revenues and salary." 
</P>
<P>
However large the increase in salaries, baseball's upper-echelon players are 
sure to benefit far more than the game's lesser lights. 
</P>
<P>
"The journeyman infielder will always be vulnerable," Reich said.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Why the players complain it just ain't cricket: The strike
could wipe out America's baseball season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thursday night in Baltimore was fit for the end of the world or the baseball
season, whichever matters most. With thunder and lightning offstage, the
downpour began gently enough ('English rain,' said the man in the seat
behind), but soon assumed biblical proportions. The Baltimore Orioles and
the Boston Red Sox struggled into the third inning before the umps called
for the tarp and nearly three hours later they called it a night.
There was no 'make-up' game yesterday. In fact no major league baseball was
played anywhere in America yesterday, nor may it be for the foreseeable
future. After Thursday night's finale and with 50 days still to go in the
regular season, 672 professional players from 28 teams walked out on strike.
It is quite possible that no World Series, the ultimate championship, will
take place in October, the first such gap in the peacetime autumnal calendar
since 1905.
This is the eighth labour dispute in America's national sport in the last 22
years and undoubtedly the most serious since 1981, when nearly two months
were lost in mid-season. Though it has been coming a long time - the players
and owners have had no contract since last year - it casts a long pall. A
season that had more than its usual share of magic on the field has been cut
short.
The dispute pits two so far immovable forces - 28 team owners versus a
players' association (union). The owners, probably the only cartel in
America with congressional exemption from the antitrust laws, claim the
financial stability of the sport is in jeopardy; the players, with many
hard-won contractual victories under their spikes, suspect the owners want
to reinstate labour servitude.
The strike is, of course, all about money but, because it is baseball, the
most subtle of all sports, it is much more complicated than mere player pay.
This one is essentially about a concept known as the 'salary cap', already
in use in American football and basketball. The ceiling is not on the
individual contract but on total team payroll. If a superstar is paid a
fortune, then savings have to be made elsewhere on the playing roster.
The idea stems from the desire of the owners to reach a different
revenue-sharing agreement with the players from the 50-50 split in effect
under the expired contract. The owners contend that as many as half the
teams now operate at a loss, but since no team books are open for inspection
this is impossible to verify. Cynics point out that, if even a smallish
franchise can change hands for Dollars 125m, as the Seattle Mariners did in
1992, it is unlikely to be a money loser.
What the owners have never been able to do is agree how to iron out the
revenue differences between big city teams with vast TV revenues, like Ted
Turner's Atlanta Braves, which are able to afford a Dollars 54m a year
payroll, and those pushed to find even a third of that sum. Ironically, the
team with the best playing record this year, the Montreal Expos, has only an
Dollars 18.5m payroll, the second lowest after the Dollars 15.5m of the San
Diego Padres. The players argue that they should not be forced to suffer
from the owners' inability to settle their own problems.
But public sympathy is not exactly with the men who play the game. The
average major league salary now stands at Dollars 1.2m a year, nearly a
tenfold increase in the last 14 years. The fact that Bobby Bonilla of the
New York Mets stands to lose Dollars 31,148 per day's work does not exactly
cause the suffering faithful at Shea Stadium to weep buckets, given their
own take-home pay. There might be more feeling for those on the annual
minimum wage (Dollars 109,000), though many of them have been sent down to
the minor leagues to keep playing - and to be paid for it.
But economists are urging the players to stand fast. Henry Aaron (of the
Brookings Institution, not the Henry Aaron who hit 755 home runs) wrote this
week that the owners' plan was nakedly designed to increase team revenues at
the expense of salaries without guaranteeing that profits would be
distributed among the poorer teams. Baseball, he concluded, 'is financially
and competitively alive and well'.
It is in fact only a medium-sized business. Its estimated annual revenues of
about Dollars 2bn put it on a par with, for example, Dell Computer and the
New York Times. The strike will mostly hit local economies (about 2,000 are
employed directly and indirectly whenever the Orioles play at home), but
will not exactly be a factor in Fed monetary policies.
Still, baseball was on a roll, with this year's attendance projected at 70m.
Marvellous new stadiums in Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Arlington in
Texas and popular new teams in Colorado and Florida have attracted vast
crowds (an Orioles ticket is like gold dust) and done much to revitalise
decaying downtowns.
Above all, this season had threatened to be one for the ages. All the six
realigned divisions have been competitive, even if the two in the west have
competed mostly to be awful. Individual records were under serious attack,
like the 61 home runs hit by Roger Maris in 1961. Perhaps the juiced-up
baseball has been a factor but, as of Thursday night, Matt Williams of San
Francisco, with 43 dingers, was exactly on Maris's pace, with Griffey,
Thomas, Bonds and Belle not far behind. Tony Gwynn of San Diego was batting
.394 with a fair chance of being the first since Ted Williams in 1941 to hit
the magical .400 mark (that is, four hits in every 10 official times at
bat). On the pitching side, Maddux, Mussina, Key and Cone were all at their
artful best, while Kenny Rogers of Texas pitched only the 12th perfect game
(no runner reaching base) in the history of baseball.
There were glimmers of cracks in owner solidarity on Thursday night, but
little optimism from the players. Ben McDonald, the Oriole pitcher, was
asked if President Bill Clinton might intervene, as he has contemplated. Big
Ben, who might have heard about the crime bill failure in Congress during
the rain delay, acidly replied: 'He can't take care of his own business,
much less ours.'

BASEBALL OWNERS AFFIRM PLAN FOR LOCKOUT AT SPRING TRAINING 
</P>

<P>
Baseball owners today reiterated their plan for a spring training lockout but 
seemed to soften their hard-line stance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our strategy," Milwaukee owner Bud Selig said. "But 
there is going to be another meeting with the players on Monday, and this is 
going to be a day-by-day negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Camps are scheduled to open Thursday. Clubs have been told by the owners not to 
start spring training unless an agreement is reached with players on a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Selig, chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee, tried to avoid the 
word "lockout." When pressed, he said, "nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connor, management's chief negotiator, said, "The clubs are not free to 
go to camp on Feb. 15." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent, who attended the two-hour meeting with owners, said 
he hoped something could be accomplished in next week's bargaining sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm eager to find a resolution to this problem. I am trying, in a way I hope 
is relevant, to be useful," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the efforts will be very intensive to reach an agreement 
in the nearest possible time frame. Will that happen? I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., was 
about to enter a meeting with players in Phoenix when owners announced their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so unnecessary," said Fehr, who met with 50 players in Los Angeles on 
Thursday night. "This is a lockout in an industry that just signed a 
billion-and-a-half dollar television contract. It's going to be very difficult 
to generate any kind of sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a demand by the owners to tie player salaries to the amount of 
money the teams make. Such an arrangement would in effect cap salaries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the owners want to make performance on the playing field a 
determining factor in how much players are paid in their first six years in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Selig said the owners endorsed the strategy that the negotiating committee has 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously if on Feb. 15 there is no agreement, the camps won't be opened," he 
said. "We're going to take each day and each week as it comes and get this 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The players are seeking an increase in the minimum salary from $68,000 to 
$125,000 and oppose any proposals that would put a lid on how high salaries can 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Some star players have reached stratospheric salary levels, with several 
receiving contracts worth more than $3 million a year in recent months, led by 
Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to lock the spring training gates was the second such move by the 
owners since 1976 when a 22-day stoppage occurred. That was halted on orders 
from then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, and the regular season opened on schedule.

<HL> Football Fallout: End of Strike
Isn't End of Sports-Labor Turmoil

   Is it over? 
Is the football strike really over? 
Can we all look now? 

   That depends on what you hope to see. 

   If you're waiting to see the returning strikers play, tune in next weekend. 
After all, the 24-day walkout that added some new terms to the National Football League's lexicon -- most notably "replacement teams" -- did indeed end late last week, when players returned to camp without a labor contract, without any bargaining gains and without much pride. 

   But if what you really want to see is peace on the sports-labor front, you've got a much longer wait coming. 

   In the football battle, the bickering sides will face off again soon in a Minneapolis federal court over the union's antitrust suit. 
The union also has charged management with unfair labor practices before the National Labor Relations Board, alleging management's refusal to play the strikers yesterday and tonight constitutes an illegal lockout that will cost union members $20 million. 
Both sides somehow still hope to cut a deal on a new labor pact, although talks haven't resumed. 

   Moreover, the union's humbling defeat at the hands of a unified management playing labor hardball may also foreshadow tougher days ahead for the players' counterparts in basketball and baseball. 
Legal specialists, for instance, don't expect the NFL union to prevail in its lawsuit -- and believe the suit will make it tougher for the National Basketball Association's players' union to win a similar lawsuit it has filed. 
The NFL union's retreat also raises the risks for sports players that management will continue to effectively use replacement teams to quash strikes. 
And the football players' defeat raises a troubling question for all player unions: How committed will professional athletes actually be when the going gets tough? 

   With the high salaries being paid to top athletes these days, "you have relatively contented athletes who aren't fighting for their precious liberties any more," says Randal Hendricks, a sports agent. 
"That doesn't mean they won't fight, but you have to pick your battles carefully." 

   The big loser for now, though, is the NFL Players Association -- whose members lost more than $80 million in pay during the strike -- and its chief, former all-pro tackle Gene Upshaw. 

   Critics contend the union underestimated management's financial power and overestimated its members' commitment to the issue that prompted the strike-free agency. 
Gary Roberts, a Tulane University law professor and an authority on sports-labor law, also criticizes union leadership for failing to provide for its players financially, either through a strike fund, a line of credit or by delaying the strike so players could collect more pay. 

   Union leadership also misjudged the impact of the cash flow provided by the replacement games. 
Attendance and ratings did fall, but not as much as the union had hoped, and the networks continued to subsidize the substitute games (although network sources estimate that more than half the rights fees for the past three weeks of replacement games will eventually be refunded by the owners). 

   The NFL Management Council's sevenmember executive committee also kept a tight rein on its members, says Leigh Steinberg, a sports attorney and agent, "which enables management to speak with one voice that tends to be constituted of some of the toughest and shrewdest negotiators they have." 
By contrast, the union was plagued throughout by widespread reports of deep divisions among its staff, player representatives and members. 

   Having called off the strike, the union's last resort was the lawsuit and many legal experts believe that has little chance of success. 
They say that the courts have generally ruled that the issues involved in the NFL labor impasse are subjects for the collective-bargaining process and are thus exempt from the antitrust laws. 
"The suit's only value was as a bargaining chip," says Mr. Roberts. 
"They're left with no leverage and a dog of a suit." 

   Meanwhile, sports authorities are just beginning to assess the impact of the strike's failure on other sports -- and initial betting is that it doesn't bode well for the players. 

   The NFL's suit, for instance, may hurt a similar suit filed in New York federal court earlier this month by the NBA players' union. 
The basketball union chose to file its suit early on and forego -- at least for the time being -- a work stoppage. 
Its suit, sports-law specialists say, contains the same inherent weakness as the NFL suit -- that is, it focuses on issues normally reserved for the collective-bargaining process. 
However, by filing the suit before negotiations reached an impasse, the NBA union hoped the courts wouldn't view the issue as a collective-bargaining dispute. 

   "There's always a chance if you draw the right judge under the right circumstances," Mr. Roberts says. 
Now, he adds, the NFL's failed strike underscores for the courts that this is a collective-bargaining issue. 
"The way the NFL's suit was filed, coming at the end of a disastrous strike, is going to weaken the NBA's efforts to win its suit," Mr. Roberts says. 

   But at this point, athletes may have few alternatives. 
For one thing, the NFL strike is a clear sign that players are losing their taste for the picket lines. 
As salaries soar, union militancy subsides. 
And strikes are especially costly to athletes, who are paid seasonally rather than year-round; thus, each week's paycheck represents a big chunk of a big income. 

   Did the NBA union opt for the courtroom because its members, whose average pay tops $500,000 a year, wouldn't stand still for a strike over free agency? 
"You have to think that basketball people, after watching the football situation, reached that conclusion quickly," Mr. Hendricks says. 

   The NFL's successful use of replacement games to break the strike also could prove to be a role model for other sports. 
Both basketball and baseball, for instance, have organized minor leagues already operating. 
"In our case, the Continental Basketball Association is a source of players and really, you only need nine or ten players on a team for a decent game," says Russell Granik, executive vice president of the NBA. 

   If NFL owners, through replacement teams, have devised a strike defense, that would be especially bad news for the baseball union, which has used the strike effectively in the past. 

   After the 1985 strike, owners effectively shut down what had been the most unrestricted market for free agents in sports simply by refusing to bid on players. 
An arbitrator recently ruled that a violation of the collective-bargaining pact. 

   The arbitrator's remedy isn't expected until early next year, but baseball sources think he will encourage both sides to settle the issue themselves. 
That would mean reopening collective bargaining, at least on the free-agency issue. 
The current contract doesn't expire until 1989. 

   Baseball sources expect extremely tough negotiations. 
But will baseball players, who make more than $400,000 annually on average, be any more likely to strike over free agency than basketball and football players? 
Most observers aren't sure, but Mr. Hendricks, the agent, hopes so. 
The other major sports haven't had meaningful free agency; baseball has. 
"When a union wants to push players onward and upward, they're going to have trouble," he says. 
"But (players will) fight to keep what they've already gained." 

   The big risk for everybody in sports is that the fan will grow weary of people fooling with his fun and games. 
NFL officials say it took the league three years to win back fans after the 1982 strike. 
And consider this latest tidbit, from Sidney Shlenker, owner of the NBA's Denver Nuggets: During the NFL strike, he said in answer to a question at a recent luncheon, even his Nuggets suffered -- season ticket sales dipped 50% compared with the comparable, year-earlier period. 
And that in the face of an overall increase in season-ticket sales for the franchise. 
Similar fates befell other NBA teams, he said. 
"I think people are getting fed up with labor-relations problems in sports," he concludes.

   Baseball owners are doing better than ever,
increasing their operating profits by 75 percent in 1989 to a
record $214.5 million, according to financial figures obtained by
The Associated Press.
   The 26 teams took in a record $1,241,059,000 in 1989, a 23
percent increase from the previous season. Their operating expenses
were $1,026,550,000, a 16 percent increase from 1988.
   That left them with a pre-tax operating profit of $214,509,000,
or an average of $8.3 million per team. The previous record profit
of $121.6 million was set in 1988 on earnings of $1,007,519,000,
baseball's first billion-dollar season.
   The figures were obtained by the AP from two baseball sources on
the condition they not be identified.
   It was the sixth consecutive season baseball teams increased
their operating profits. Because of the accounting practices of the
various teams, financial figures for 1990 will not be available
until next year.
   Chuck O'Connor, the head of management's Player Relations
Committee, said the figures showed that baseball ``on an overall
basis was doing quite well.''
   ``The difficulty with it,'' he said Tuesday, ``is that you have
to get below the aggregate figures to determine the level of health
of the individual parts that make up the game - the 26 clubs.
There, there's a different story. You can't look at the overall
industry profits and say, `Therefore, my team in Pittsburgh is in
great shape' or `My team in Kansas City is in great shape.'''
   O'Connor said that four clubs lost money in 1989 but that the
figure would become nine based on an apportioned share of the
tentative $280 million collusion settlement.
   Baseball has boomed since the mid-1980s. According to figures
released by the commissioner's office in the past, the 26 teams
lost $66.6 million in 1983 on revenues of $521.6 million, then cut
the losses to $41 million in 1984 and $7.1 million in 1985.
   The teams made $11.5 million in 1986, the season after began
shunning free agents. Two arbitrators found the conspiracy
depressed player salaries and the profit soared to $103.3 million
in 1987.
   In the four years following the start of the conspiracy, the
teams made a total operating profit of $450.9 million.
   However, as part of the tentative settlement of the collusion
cases, owners have agreed to give the Major League Baseball Players
Association a payment that would amount to $280 million as of Jan.
2. Interest will be added if the payment is made after that date.
   One source said that approximately 50 percent of the 1989
revenues came from tickets sales, parking and concessions.
Approximately 20 percent came from national radio and television
contracts, 20 percent from local broadcasting contracts and the
remainder from postseason games, advertising and other
baseball-related revenue.
   Approximately 31.5 percent of the operating revenue was spent on
player salaries, the source said.

<HL> Baseball Players Contend Owners Continue to Thwart Free Agency </HL>

<TEXT>
   Has the "free" sneaked back into baseball's free-agent market? 

   Some people thought so when the New York Yankees plucked slugger Jack Clark away from St. Louis last week. 
But Mr. Clark moved more out of pique than for profit after talks with the Cardinals soured. 
St. Louis insisted it would have topped New York's offer of a two-year contract for $1.5 million a year plus incentives that could total $650,000 a year. 

   So it goes in the acrimonious world of baseball's labor relations. 
Owners may bid on some select free agents, and a few of them may actually change teams -- but rarely for economic reasons. 
And to the players' union, that still constitutes collusion and price-fixing. 
"The locks aren't on as tightly as they used to be, but it's still far from a free market," insists Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. 

   Indeed, for the third straight year, the union is expected to file a grievance contending that management has conspired to restrict bidding on free agents, those players who, after at least six years of major league duty and the expiration of their contracts, seek to market their services to the highest bidder. 
Last fall, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that owners had conspired to close down the market for free agents after the 1985 season. 

   This is emerging as a pivotal year on baseball's labor front. 
Arbitrator George Nicolau has been hearing testimony in New York this week on the union's 1986 grievance, which most sports law authorities consider an even more-compelling example of collusion than the 1985 case. 
On Monday, Mr. Roberts begins hearings in the remedy phase of the 1985 case. 
Both arbitrators are expected to rule by spring, decisions that will go a long way toward determining the future of the free-agent market and the likelihood of a crippling strike when baseball's current labor agreement expires after the 1989 season. 

   In reality, free agency hasn't existed in baseball since Peter Ueberroth transferred his considerable financial-management skills to the commissioner's office after the 1984 Olympic Games. 
Suddenly, teams were talking about fiscal responsibility and the foolhardiness of wildly bidding on free agents. 
So they didn't. 
Period. 

   But things opened up a bit this year. 
Cleveland's Brett Butler accepted a contract offer from San Francisco. 
Chili Davis and Mike Davis moved down the California coast from San Francisco and Oakland, respectively, to Anaheim's California Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
A half-dozen teams bid for journeyman pitcher Dennis Martinez, enabling him to pry a hefty raise out of the Montreal Expos, for whom he performed last season. 
"With certain groups of players, particularly superstar players and effective pitchers who may not be superstars, there is some kind of market activity," says Ronald M. Shapiro, the Baltimore lawyer who represented Mr. Martinez. 

   Yet, for the second-straight year, Detroit Tiger pitcher Jack Morris, who has won more games in the 1980s than any other pitcher, received just one offer -- from the Tigers. 
He returned to his former employer, as did most top-drawer free agents. 
Those who did change addresses rarely did so for much more money than was being offered by the present team. 

   Even the signing of Mr. Clark by the Yankees isn't that encouraging, says Stephen F. Ross, a sports-law authority at the University of Illinois. 
"Jack Clark represents a thawing of the market in the sense that the previous market not only was collusion on price, but a boycott -- nobody was bidding on other teams' players at any price," Mr. Ross says. 
"Ultimately, he's not that encouraging because he was not bid away from the Cardinals." 

   Part of the problem, player agents say, is that management negotiators are openly exchanging information about contract offers. 
"In our judgment, that's still a form of rigging the market," says Randal Hendricks, a Houston agent. 
Even in cases where several teams make offers, Mr. Hendricks says, the bids all land within a tight salary range -- as if that range had been predetermined. 
And preference is still given to the player's old team, he insists, with other bidders careful to stay close to that team's offer. 
"There is a group viewpoint to low-ball and hang together," he says. 
"What the clubs are trying to do is figure how close they can get to breaking the law." 

   Management denies any wrongdoing. 
Free agents, they say, are expensive and haven't always given owners their money's worth. 
"I still think clubs evaluate it from the standpoint of what's in their best interest," says Tal Smith, a former baseball executive and currently a consultant who represents several teams in arbitration hearings. 

   Any boost to the free-agents' market this year came primarily from more realistic expectations from players and their agents, contends Mike Port, general manager of the California Angels. 

   Still, concern over the pending arbitration rulings prompted the Player Relations Committee, management's labor arm, to discourage direct communication between clubs about free-agent dealings, says Barry Rona, PRC executive director. 
"We've told the clubs if they're seeking salary data to go through us as a conduit, we have no vested interest," he says. 
"We can obtain data for them without the appearance of collusion." 

   Agents disagree, and the issue will surely be part of the union's yet-to-be-filed 1987 grievance. 
In light of the increased market activity, the exchange of data may be the union's best evidence of continued collusion, although it isn't a "lead-pipe-cinch argument," says Robert Berry of Boston University, an authority on sports labor law. 
"I think there may be a winnable case this year, but it will be much more difficult." 

   The union hopes that stiff penalties in the current grievances, will crack open the market. 
If, however, arbitrators impose a fine of, say, $10 million, that amounts to only about $400,000 a team, points out Mr. Hendricks, the agent. 
"And maybe they've saved $2 million a team" from the conspiracy, he adds. 
"They've got to say, 'That's cheap, let's keep it up.'" 

   Beyond monetary damages, the union is expected to request that free agents affected by the conspiracy be given the option to test the market again. (That prospect reportedly squelched a proposed trade of Detroit's Kirk Gibson, the top 1985 free agent, to Los Angeles.) 
"We're obviously opposed to it," Mr. Rona says. 
"It goes beyond the remedial stage and is rewriting the basic agreement." 

   Meanwhile, if the owners' position doesn't change, Mr. Hendricks says, it will force the union to also act in concert. 
One proposal: Certifying a small number of agents to represent players. 
In that way, the union, with the power to withdraw certification and shut an agent out, could keep more control over contract talks, ensuring that some maverick agent couldn't accept an offer that would lower the market. 

   Such proposals only add to the bad feelings brewing between owners and their employees, agents say. 
And it increases the chance of a crippling strike two years hence. 
"There are so many hard differences between players and owners and I have seen no efforts toward peace," says agent Tom Reich. 
"I see no reason whatsoever to be optimistic that there won't be a serious work stoppage."

<LEADPARA>  AS FRANK CASHEN recalls it, there used to be a saying among major league
baseball executives. "We said you could take your money down to the corner and
put it into a savings and loan and do better," he said. "With what's happened
to S&amp;L's, I'm not sure you'd do either now.";    In the opinion of the game's
26 general managers, including the New York Mets' Cashen, baseball is headed
for the same fate as the S&amp;L industry. That is, an institution that always

<TEXT>     The salaries of players wondrous and woeful have jumped off the sports
pages in recent months while revenue sources essentially remained the same.
St. Louis pitcher Joe Magrane compiles a 10-17 record, and his salary goes
from $300,000 to $1 million, even though Magrane won't be able to play this
season. Boston's Roger Clemens signs for 50 percent more than the salary of
the A's Dave Stewart, who had been the top-paid pitcher. The examples are
well-documented, and the ramifications are foreboding.;    Several of the
general managers who were surveyed by the Mercury News said it has reached the
point where some teams cannot afford to contend.;    Mike Port of the
California Angels said trading increasingly has been inhibited (as the Giants
discovered in the case of shortstop Jose Uribe) and will be more so this
season. Woody Woodward of Seattle and Larry Doughty of Pittsburgh said they
are unable to pursue "blue-chip" free agents.;    Al Rosen of the Giants said
he expects anywhere from 10 to 15 clubs to lose money this year, and this time
without collusion costs included. The A's payroll has doubled within a year,
making a 17-game winner (Scott Sanderson) unaffordable and making it
increasingly difficult to keep an American League dynasty intact.;    Next TV
contract; won't be in billions; Bill Wood of Houston said it is "a good bet
that we've spent that money from the last TV contract, with halfway to go" --
and CBS, which paid $1.06 billion for four years in the current contract,
seems unlikely to talk in billions again in the 1993 deal.;    A couple of
teams have found it necessary to dump high-salaried veterans without
guaranteed contracts -- Fernando Valenzuela and Pete Incaviglia.;    And most
ominously, there is fear in Pittsburgh that the Pirates, who opened the
century with a string of pennants, will end the century somewhere else.
Doughty said the club "would just have to draw back and allow ourselves to
remain solvent" before that were to happen. Yet, just the thought of two Bucs
franchises in the Tampa, Fla., area is cause for concern, taking away some of
the optimism that always abounds on opening day.;    "It's like walking off a
cliff blindfolded -- you never know which step will take you into the abyss,"
Port said, grimly. "It's a Catch-22, because we have to fulfill our charge to
be competitive, yet possibly take ourselves ever closer to that next step on
the cliff.";    Dal Maxvill of St. Louis calls it a "big flashing beacon," and
baseball is not ignoring it. Management and union agreed on a blue-ribbon
study group that includes former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker,
Rockefeller Foundation Chairman Peter Goldmark of the Rockefeller Foundation,
Cal law professor David Feller, Henry Aaron (not the Hall-of-Fame player) of
the Brookings Institution, Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig and Donald Fehr,
head of the Players Association.;    Commissioner Fay Vincent said during a
spring-training visit to Arizona that he hopes to have substantial data "in
about a year" and then address the major issues.;    "If you see the iceberg
emerging, you will not hit it. Why do we have to wait until we hit it?"
Vincent said. "The group will look at the economics of baseball in its
broadest sense and make recommendations and findings. The thing we need most
is some data, some correlation between what our figures are and what the
Players Association's figures are. One problem we have with the union is
establishing a factual basis for economics. That's why this group was
formed.";    G.M. view clouded;; players ignore storm;  According to Fehr,
"One of the problems with general managers making comments is that it may be
that a G.M. only sees a tiny part of the operation. The general manager of the
White Sox doesn't know anything about the real estate side. And it's all tied
up together. The general manager of the Braves may not know very much about
how much TBS is making. You've got to correlate all this data and try to make
sense of it.";    Dave Anderson, the Giants' co-player representative and a
four-year rep while with Los Angeles, said players do not see the storm clouds
that the general managers speak about.;    "Our whole complaint (during last
year's labor standoff) was that there was no telltale sign of problems in
baseball," he said. "Teams were making money. Salaries basically stayed the
same for a few years. If we have evidence of financial problems in the game,
the Players Association will try to work with management as much as it can.
Until that happens, we feel the system is working pretty good. There's no
question that this is a good time to play baseball.";    The average salary is
about $800,000 this season. More than 40 players make at least $3 million a
year, as Rickey Henderson reminds us. Each G.M. winces at each trend-setting
contract, such as Rosen's November free-agent signing of Bud Black (four
years, $10 million), and each G.M. says it is a matter of playing by the
rules.;    Some teams are choosing not to play by the rules, though. St. Louis
and Houston, two frequent contenders in the 1980s, let their big free agents
walk and chose to rebuild.;    "Not to say a Houston or a St. Louis won't
shock somebody," said Montreal G.M. David Dombrowski, "but they're not taking
the approach it takes to win.";    Added Lee Thomas of Philadelphia: "Once
clubs find out they're not going to be in a race, they're going to try to get
out from under. Some already can't afford to win. I don't like to see that
happen to this game. A lot of us are trying to screw it up.";    From a fan's
view, Chicago G.M. Jim Frey said, one noticeable change this year will be the
lack of trades for middle-level players.;    "I mean veteran, bench players,"
he said. "Not long ago, there were times when I'd look across the field and
see (Lou) Piniella and Jim Spencer and (Bob) Watson sitting on the bench,
waiting to pinch hit. You can't afford to have players at that level now. I
think all of us are trying to concentrate on younger players whenever
possible.";    One concern to most everyone, even to some players, is the
disparity between large and small markets.;    Small markets can't; compete
with giants;  Although even they are prohibiting contract extensions during
this uncertainty, the Los Angeles Dodgers have the financial wherewithal to
pay a Darryl Strawberry what he wants. Their local TV deal pays well. But how
do you compete in Cleveland or Seattle or any of a number of smaller cities?
You had better have a plentiful farm system, and even then you can only keep
talent for so long.;    "If we had kept 11 players from our (world
championship) '87 team that won 85 games in a division not as strong as it is
today, those players would be worth $23.5 million now," Minnesota G.M. Andy
MacPhail said. "No way we can do that." He was referring to Tom Brunansky,
Kirby Puckett, Dan Gladden, Greg Gagne, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, Gene Larkin,
Bert Blyleven, Jeff Reardon, Juan Berenguer and Frank Viola. Seven are gone.; 
  "You have teams that bring in $32 million and teams that bring in $100
million, and yet our expenses are interrelated," added MacPhail, who
nevertheless signed veteran pitcher Jack Morris to a deal that could be worth
up to $11 million over three years. "I think people understand that it's not
going to last this way. We have been undergoing a process of educating the
fans to that effect. It's just going to be a matter of two or three years, if
not sooner, that we have some traumatic event.";    What is that traumatic
event? When Vincent was asked for his worst-case scenario, he replied, "I
learned a long time ago, the worst case never happens. We live our lives in
the gray, never in the black.";    Most of the general managers were less
optimistic. Most said they feared a franchise "going belly-up" and trying to
find a buyer. The Houston Astros, who were bankrupt once before, have been for
sale the past winter, and it has not been easy for John McMullen to find a
suitable taker.;    "When you don't have a handle on your expenses, and you
know pretty much what your revenue streams are, you've got a real problem,"
Rosen said. "And there might someday be a club that can't afford this anymore.
Then what if you can't find a buyer?;    "Sure, there might be owners who, in
order to massage their egos, want to own a major league team, and they may be
willing to lose $3, 4, 5 million a year, but no one knows what the topside is
as salaries continue to escalate. You may be talking about $20 million losses.
Or $25 million. Who knows where the salaries are going to go?";    The fans
will howl; at big jump in prices;  National League President Bill White,
during a recent lecture in Chicago, said about the possibility of an owner
declaring bankruptcy: "I don't think that day is far off unless they pass it
on to the fans -- and I don't think they'll stand for $20 to $30 for a
ticket.";    Boston G.M. Lou Gorman said the Red Sox "appeal to the working
class. The guy who's got a family wants to spend $8 or $9 a ticket, buy a hot
dog and a drink, and not go broke. Our ticket prices have stayed reasonably
the same over the last seven years, and our payroll has gone from $7 million
to $34 million in that time.";    So why did Gorman make Clemens, a player who
performs only every fifth day, the richest player in the game? Cashen, who
then has to negotiate with Dwight Gooden and Viola, calls it "the worst
example I've seen over the years. That's management's fault.";    This is
Gorman's explanation: "He puts people in the ballpark. If we lose him to our
high-school draft (a form of compensation for a lost free agent), they would
have hung me from a flagpole in center field.";    Fehr remains skeptical
about the concern over the disparity in markets.;    "I spent all last
winter," he said, "listening to very nasty complaints about small markets:
'They're terrible, they can't generate enough revenues. We have to have salary
caps. We're going to do this, we're going to do that, and we're going to lock
you out to get it.';    "Now we get to November 1990, and they have to pay
collusion damages, and they owe the players $280 million. They can pay that
any way they wanted to. Do you think they gave Pittsburgh and Milwaukee a
break? Huh-unh. Pittsburgh and Milwaukee were forced by the other clubs to pay
ever last nickel the Dodgers, the Mets and the Yankees do.;    "What that
suggests is that the clubs, overall, don't really have the concern that would
be best for collective bargaining.";    Virtually all of the general managers
agreed that salaries should be somehow tied to performance. That idea was
rejected by the union during the 1990 lockout. The executives said the past
negotiations and holdouts are good reason for it.;    "Now, all you've got to
do is just show up and stay healthy," Frey said. "Performance is just one part
of the equation. You've got to have 25 players, and somebody's got to be in
uniform. As they get their service time, they jump to service levels -- many
times, without good performance.";    Added MacPhail: "The one thing that
ought to be crystal clear now is, it doesn't have a damn thing to do with
money. It's who's making more. Whether we go through some sort of statistical
level that compensates a player for stats, or whether it's a (salary) cap that
a player reaches and tops off and doesn't have to worry about it anymore, I'm
confident baseball will solve its problems.";    Dodgers G.M. Fred Claire said
he hopes all parties in baseball will recognize that "we're just passing
through. We're fortunate to have a hand or a say in what is taking place, and
we should recognize the responsibility we have in every part.";    Atlanta
G.M. John Schuerholz said agents tell him privately "how wacky this baseball
salary business is.";    Texas G.M. Tom Grieve said the fact that the union
agreed to the study-group concept and the group's membership was a sign that
it is interested in cooperating.;    Rosen is not buying it.;    "Why would a
player want to give up what he's got?" he asked. "Why would (Giants catcher)
Steve Decker, who's a budding young star, first year in the league, want to do
something that would keep him from making the kind of money that some of his
predecessors are making?;    What goes up; must come down;  "And that's a
constituency of the Players Association. Those fellows can't act without the
players voting. Now how are you going to get your message across to the
players? Those players don't care. . . . The only way they're going to give it
up is kicking and screaming to the gas chamber.;    "But," he added, "one
thing I've learned from life is that nothing goes (only) up. And it returns to
Earth a hell of a lot faster. Galileo proved that.";    No one can predict
what the descent will be in baseball. Much depends on what money CBS will
offer in 1993. A CBS Sports spokesman said the network "would rather not
speculate on what may happen in the future," and Vincent said, "I'm not that
smart. I don't know how anybody can predict something two years off. Network
TV is a complicated industry.";    Gorman said of the next TV contract: "The
money won't be the same. CBS has already asked baseball to pay back $200
million.";    In the meantime, the Giants' Anderson said, players will enjoy
their prosperity and wait for the study group to show any cause for concern.
In the meantime, Wood said, he sees "at least a couple of years of serious
struggle for the bottom-tiered clubs.";    In the meantime, baseball will
begin again Monday, including the traditional opener at Cincinnati's
Riverfront Stadium. Reds G.M. Bob Quinn is optimistic about his
defending-champion team, but not about the major leagues' future.;   
"Certainly there's going to have to be some realism that sets in," he said.
"Right now we're in a fairy tale, a fantasy world when it comes to contract
negotiations. You're fast hitting a point where something dire will come of
it."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Rookie ball is the beginning of the long road to major league baseball that
most players never finish.;    "Ninety-five percent of them fail," said Ed
Sprague Sr., a Baltimore Orioles scout who has seen his share of high school
stars fade.;    The trials of those carefully selected few who get to start
that infrequently finished trek often go unnoticed. Once hometown favorites,
they become anonymous after signing contracts and starting their assignments
in faraway towns.;    How they handle the adjustment goes a long way in
determining how far down that road to the majors they will get, baseball
officials say.;    Baltimore's Scott Miley, Montreal's Duane Ashley and
Cleveland's Jason Hardtke are the only high school players from Santa Clara
and southern Alameda counties drafted in the last two years who signed minor
league contracts.;    Miley, who starred as a center fielder at Mission San
Jose, was taken in the 14th round by the Orioles in last year's draft. Ashley,
a former Yerba Buena pitcher, went to the Expos in the 25th round of the '89
draft. Hardtke, who was named Mercury News co-player of the year after his
senior season as a shortstop at Leland, was chosen by the Indians in the third
round of the '90 draft.;    Hardtke has reached Cleveland's Class A squad, the
Columbus (Ga.) Indians, after first being assigned to rookie ball in
Burlington, N.C.;    After 32 games and 122 at-bats, Hardtke was struggling
with a .238 batting average and nine errors.;    But the biggest challenge, he
said, is not to finish the season at .400; it's just to finish the 144-game
season.;    Hardtke said rookie ball helped him prepare for that. He learned
how to manage on the $850 per month rookies are typically paid. He learned how
to choose and set up his own apartment. And he learned to deal with being
3,000 miles away from his family in Almaden Valley.;    "It was all new to
me," Hardtke said, "added pressure.";    The Indians, like other big-league
organizations, tried to ease Hardtke's adjustment by providing some apartments
to choose from.;    "(Major league organizations) all try to do as much as
they can to make it easier," Columbus Manager Mike Brown said. "This is the
real world, and, to make things easier, that allows them to concentrate on
what they're here for.";    A tight schedule;  In addition to providing a
choice of apartments, big-league organizations set a tight schedule for
rookies to adhere to.;    For example, at Pittsburgh's spring-training
facility in Bradenton, Fla., Expos, Pirates and Atlanta Braves rookies all
live and train at the same facility.;    Breakfast is early, from 7:30 to 8:30
a.m., and dinner is from 5 to 6 p.m. There are practices and games six days a
week. The season lasts for three months.;    After a short break, successful
rookies move on to the Class A "short season," which lasts from June to
September. Those who show promise there are promoted to "long season" Class A,
where the season is 144 games long.;    Dave Tomlin, a former major league
pitcher who is now the pitching coach of the Bradenton Expos, said the rookie
schedule is tough but not unmanageable.;    "Once they get in the routine,
it's not that bad," Tomlin said. "If you want to play baseball, it's not that
bad. If you don't, then it's bad.";    And the bat boy is . . .; Tomlin said
rookie ball provides its own unique ways of disciplining players who won't
conform.;    "We have very few fans at our games," Tomlin explained. "It's not
like the organization is going to shell out money for bat boys. That's the job
the players hate most. If a guy gives me some lip, I'll just say, 'Hey, you
want to be bat boy tomorrow?' Right then, he shuts up.";    Miley, who is
being moved to first base from the outfield, said some rookies don't adapt
quickly.;    "A lot of kids out here are kind of lost," he said. "I really
didn't get lost, because this is what I really want to do.";    Sprague said
many players are not mature enough to make it on their own.;    "A lot of kids
just quit because they don't like being away," he said. "Soon as they get out
of the house, they can't handle it without Mom or Dad around.";    Sprague
added that major league clubs believe the vast majority of players should go
through rookie ball to better prepare them for the big leagues. Today's high
salaries leave little room for players who make it to the big leagues before
they are ready, he said.;    Still, that knowledge doesn't make rookie ball
any easier. Baseball officials say only those whose love for the game equals
their talent will make it.;    Hardtke said rookie ball didn't change his
feelings for the game.;    "I still love the game," he said. "I love playing
it. I thought I knew everything about the sport, but I got to professional
ball and found out I was wrong."  </TEXT>

NBA SALARY STRUCTURE DRAWS A CLOSER LOOK FROM MANAGEMENT

<P>
The NFL, following the lead of the NBA, is proposing a salary cap for its 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Donlan, executive director of the NFL Management Council, said Wednesday 
the players would benefit because there would be a "guaranteed amount of money 
clubs would be required to spend." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the NFL completed a new, mammoth, four-year television 
package with the three major networks and two cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan said if a formula were reached from "the money (the league) just 
received, the players will feel they're getting their fair share." 
</P>
<P>
The players, who have been without a collective-bargaining agreement since an 
unsuccessful strike in 1987, aren't expected to embrace the idea of a salary 
cap. Undoubtedly, they would view it as another cost-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the NFL Players Association, frustrated in its attempt to reach a 
bargaining agreement, decertified itself as a union. NFLPA executive director 
Gene Upshaw said he thought the organization would benefit by abandoning its 
role as a bargaining agent. Upshaw hoped that total free agency would 
eventually result. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, Upshaw said he was hopeful progress could be made on a 
contract after conversations with new Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan, noting that NFL salaries are steadily increasing but still lagging 
behind basketball and baseball, said the league still recognizes the NFLPA as a 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers can get together anytime to meet," Donlan said, calling the 
decertification a ploy. "I'm sure they can go back into business the same way 
they went out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Donlan produced a chart that said the average NFL salary in 1989 was $304,000 
and the 12 highest-paid players on each team averaged $593,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donlan, who has access to team salary figures, the NBA's 12-man 
rosters averaged $600,000 last year. Taking the 24 highest-paid players on each 
club for 1989, Donlan said the NFL averaged $450,000 against $488,000 for 
major-league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan also distributed a survey of players changing teams under Plan B free 
agency, a period that begins Feb. 1 and ends April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan said 51 players will be wearing new uniforms this season. In 1989, 229 
players changed teams under Plan B, including a rash of late signings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys lead this year's signings with 13, followed by the New York 
Jets with five and the Los Angeles Raiders and Washington Redskins with four 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots, who haven't signed any players, lost the most, eight. 
The New Orleans Saints were next with five, including defensive back Dave 
Waymer, the only player to sign with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have not lost any players, may be close to signing two more 
players and are looking at another. Vice president John McVay said Wednesday 
that he planned to meet with the 49ers' brain trust about signing two Atlanta 
Plan B entries, punter Rich Donnelly and center-guard Wayne Radloff. 
</P>
<P>
McVay said discussions also continue with Buffalo nose tackle Fred Smerlas. 
Coach George Seifert said the 49ers also have shown an interest in veteran 
Cleveland cornerback Hanford Dixon.

NFL MEETINGS; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS TAKE A LOOK AT REVENUE SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As an idea, revenue sharing didn't fly in baseball, but it is alive and well in 
pro basketball. On the first day of their annual convention this week, pro 
football's club owners began looking into it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No NFL owner would talk about revenue plans or possibilities for the record. 
But a source said that one option under consideration would bring a 28-club 
sharing of gate receipts and television revenue, with about half going to 
owners and half to players. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in the NBA's labor contract the money pool includes all receipts 
-- with 53% as the players' share -- and, to prove good faith, the clubs' 
financial books are shown to player representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Most NFL owners vigorously object to opening their books publicly. Thus the 
proposal to solve their labor impasse by using only gate and TV income. The 
reasoning is that these are easy to quantify. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by far the largest source of NFL income is from tickets sales and TV. 
Those in favor of the idea contend that there would be enough cash in such a 
pool to work out an accommodation with the NFL Players Assn., bringing labor 
peace -- which owners define as their first priority. 
</P>
<P>
The subject came up in recent months in informal discussions among various 
owners, and it reached the convention floor here, a source said, for these 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In negotiations with the networks, the NFL has nearly doubled its 
television revenue for each team from $17 million last year to more than $32 
million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every time the league's television income has risen in recent decades, the 
players have eventually taken most of it. "The players are now getting -- in 
salaries and benefits -- about 63% of our take," George Young, general manager 
of the New York Giants, said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Revenue sharing would mean that, this time, the owners would keep more of 
what they've earned in TV negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It likely would satisfy the players, who proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
The league has been without a collective bargaining agreement since 1987, when 
the players sought a free-agency stipulation that displeased the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in revenue sharing is some form of free agency, plus a payroll cap 
along with methods for determining many -- if not most -- salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative, some owners are saying, is a salary war with most clubs acting 
independently. They say this would shortly drain away all the fruits of the new 
television agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen of the (NFL's) 28 clubs lost money last year," Art Modell, president 
of the Cleveland Browns, said. 
</P>
<P>
That was only three years after the 1987 TV contract seemed the saving of many 
franchises, bringing in a three-year record $1.428 billion -- or $17 million 
per club. 
</P>
<P>
One ironic difference between baseball and football is their approach to 
revenue sharing. In baseball, the owners want it, but the players don't. In 
football, the owners have been against it -- at least until lately -- but the 
players will accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Both sports are without labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's owners voted, 28-0, Sunday to ratify Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's 
new network contracts, which will enrich them by $3.64 billion in the next four 
years -- or what they're saying is $32.5 million per club each season. 
</P>
<P>
That's more than twice the $14.4 million that each baseball club is receiving 
annually from its new TV contract. In the NBA contract, television pays each 
team an annual $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said that the average NFL team spent about $35 million on all 
expenses, including player salaries, last year -- meaning that, at the moment, 
television will be paying most of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pending) salary escalation," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said he has found strong NFL sentiment to permanently cut 
the pre-Super Bowl time period from two weeks to one. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll experiment with it both ways in the next two years," he said. "There 
will be a one-week break ahead of the Super Bowl (in 1991), and two weeks ahead 
of the (Minneapolis Super Bowl) in 1992. We'll see which is the most 
(popular)."

FT  16 DEC 94 / Strike impasse dashes hopes for a new start to baseball
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season
short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will
start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league
form.
Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to
declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law
that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries.
The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management
of failing to bargain in good faith. This would lead to an investigation by
the National Labour Relations Board, the independent federal agency, which
could last two months.
The NLRB has already sided with the players on a related issue by announcing
that it has filed a complaint that the owners improperly withheld Dollars
7.8m (Pounds 5m) in contributions to the players' pension fund due on August
1, less than two weeks before the strike started.
Last week the department of Labour certified the dispute as official, thus
clearing the way for the union to petition the government not to grant visas
to non-American players, mostly from Latin America, whom the owners have
threatened to import as substitutes, along with minor league players, in an
attempt to get some kind of season under way next year.
There had been some hope earlier this week that the latest round of
negotiations was making progress on alternatives to a pure salary cap as the
best means of sharing revenues more equitably between rich and poor clubs.
Modified proposals by the owners on taxing team payrolls had not been
dismissed out of hand by the players, but no agreement proved possible.
With spring training due to start in 10 weeks, there has been no break in
player solidarity, though public opinion now tends to blame them more than
the owners for the problems of the country's national sport. Some owners
have expressed misgivings about sacrificing another season, but the majority
seem determined to let the confrontation run its course.

<HL> Antitrust Suit
Against NBA
Filed by Players

   Labor gridlock gripped much of the professional sports world yesterday. 

   The professional basketball players union filed suit against the National Basketball Association in a Newark, N.J., federal court, charging that the league's annual draft of college players, its team salary caps and its provision for first refusal rights on players seeking to switch teams violate antitrust laws. 

   Meanwhile, the impasse in the National Football League's labor talks continued as league owners prepared to resume play Sunday with nonunion players and about 35 others who crossed picket lines. 

   During prolonged negotiations with the league, the NBA Players Association has been seeking to abolish the draft, the salary cap ($4 million per team last year) and the right of first refusal, which it claims restricts players' movement and earning power by reducing competition among teams for their services. 

   So far, little progress has been made on those issues after nine sessions. 
The league's collective bargaining agreement expired June 15 and a negotiated moratorium on signing rookies and free agents expired yesterday. 

   Lawrence Fleisher, the union's general counsel, said the union has sought an expedited proceeding in the hope of avoiding a lockout or strike. 
He didn't rule out the possibility of a strike but said players are free to sign contracts and report to training camp Oct. 9. 
The NBA season begins Nov. 6. 

   Russell Granik, executive vice president of the NBA, said the league remains "very comfortable in our position that until there is a new agreement or a work stoppage, we are required to operate under the last collective bargaining agreement." 
He pointed out that the validity of the draft and the salary cap were affirmed by both a trial court and appellate court last year in a case brought by player Leon Wood. 

   On the NFL front, players continued to return to their teams. 
So far, however, only a small percentage of the union's 1,585 members have decided to return for this week's games. 
Fans were also returning -- their tickets. 
NFL teams reported thousands of requests for refunds and said they expected thousands more. 

   Neither side has moved to resume talks, preferring instead to wait and see who gets the upper hand after this week's games. 

   The NFL and NBA represent two of the nation's four major professional sports leagues, along with Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. 
In recent years, only the NHL has avoided a work stoppage.

IS THERE A LIMIT TO SALARIES?; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BANKRUPTCY FOR A MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM IS CONSIDERED POSSIBLE BY SOME 
EXECUTIVES BECAUSE OF THE COST OF FREE AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SANDOMIR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 baseball free-agent auction is nearly over, a hyperactive exercise in 
free enterprise. Along the way, contracts worth millions of dollars were 
bestowed upon great and mediocre players. 
</P>
<P>
In one 30-day stretch between November and December, 29 players were signed to 
contracts totaling $209 million, at an annual average salary of $2.4 million 
for an average of three years. 
</P>
<P>
In neon, the figures flashed across the tote boards of the national pastime: 
Darryl Strawberry for $20.2 million! George Bell for $9.8 million! Franklin 
Stubbs for $6 million! Matt Young for $6.4 million? 
</P>
<P>
If ownership's apparent desire to mug itself so willingly leads fans to assume 
that surely the money must be there, there is another way to look at baseball's 
increasingly bizarre balance sheet: What if a team went broke trying to pay the 
free-agent freight? 
</P>
<P>
It's not so strange a thought. Sure, there are still three years left on CBS' 
and ESPN's $1.46-billion deals, which gives each owner about $14 million 
annually. Sure, baseball attendance keeps breaking records. 
</P>
<P>
But with so much money being spent so freely, the idea that one day a 
ballclub's salary expenses may so exceed its revenues that it could go broke is 
not out of reason's realm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you might have more than one team go bankrupt and no buyer out there 
willing to take the responsibility for it," says General Manager Al Rosen of 
the San Francisco Giants, who in the last month committed $33 million of owner 
Bob Lurie's money to lure pitchers Bud Black and Dave Righetti and outfielder 
Willie McGee to Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie had previously made commitments totaling $30 million to Will Clark and 
Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hope it wouldn't come to bankruptcy," says Bob Quinn, general manager of 
the Cincinnati Reds. "But knowing (baseball's) history, it might have to come 
to it. We always come close to the brink before taking action." 
</P>
<P>
The question to answer over the next few years -- assuming a continuing salary 
spiral that could produce an average player salary of $1 million, from the 
current $597,000 -- is this: Would a team's bankruptcy make a dent in the 
skyrocketing salaries? 
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly be a rare occasion for a sports club to go bankrupt," says 
the Kansas City Royals' president, Joe Burke. "But you know, I don't even know 
if a bankruptcy would stop the salary spiral." 
</P>
<P>
Says Lurie: "If a club went bankrupt tomorrow, I don't even know if it would 
matter. Teams would say, 'It's your problem, not ours.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Lurie is right, it is even more likely that little sympathy would come from 
the players' side. After all, the players' association has proved highly 
unsympathetic to the owners when they cry poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Jack Sands, who negotiated a two-year, $2.2-million deal for Willie 
Wilson on Dec. 3 that shifted him from Kansas City to Oakland, says: 
"Bankruptcy won't happen. But if it does, the players wouldn't say the party's 
over, the owners were right and let's give back the family jewels." 
</P>
<P>
Sands insists that a team owner on the brink of bankruptcy would find willing 
buyers, especially in the four cities recently eliminated from consideration as 
expansion-team sites. "The commissioner won't let a team go broke," Sands adds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team going belly-up would not be a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. If no 
successor owner loomed in the wings, the team would be handed over to the 
league to operate and sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about a team going broke," says Deputy Commissioner Steve 
Greenberg. "But to remain competitive on the field, you have to compete for 
talent. Some teams will have to make a decision to lose millions of dollars by 
signing players or to compete with less expensive, less experienced players, 
which means you don't compete. Going broke is an extreme, and a rational person 
would hopefully choose to go with a skeleton crew." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sight of an owner filing a bankruptcy petition at federal court is 
unlikely, though, it is probable that some financial woes will descend upon 
some, maybe even many teams, for several reasons. Increased salaries are the 
obvious culprit. Payrolls of $30 million will soon be common, and revenues must 
flow in if those obligations are to be met. 
</P>
<P>
And consider the future financial stability that seemed assured with the 
CBS-ESPN contracts that expire after the 1993 season. Some teams barely put 
their hands on the cash before handing much of it right over to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"That TV money went through us like ships passing in the night," says Pirate 
President Carl Barger. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, for instance, will pay $17.7 million to their five free-agent 
signees this season, $3.7 more than the club's share of the TV riches. The 
Athletics have far exceeded their annual national TV booty with their 
re-signings of Jose Canseco, Dave Stewart, Dave Henderson, Bob Welch, Dennis 
Eckersley and Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be ignored in the equation is the effect of the $280-million collusion 
penalty levied against owners earlier this year for rigging the free-agent 
markets in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each team will pay $10.76 million to the 
players' association in installments over 15 months, starting Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to some recently purchased teams, such as the Texas Rangers and 
Seattle Mariners, is the cost of paying bank loans used to finance some of the 
acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams will have to make some very difficult decisions," says Jeff 
Smulyan, part owner of the Mariners, who adds that the Mariners' debt is not 
onerous. "I don't see a bankruptcy happening, but you could see some economic 
misery." 
</P>
<P>
Owners in small markets certainly have the greatest reason for financial 
concern, especially when they see how much more in TV-and-radio rights fees 
their big-market brethren receive. How can the have-nots, with no more than $5 
million to $7 million in broadcast fees, play the free-agent sweepstakes game 
when the haves play the sport with $15 million to $50 million? 
</P>
<P>
Well, in some cases, they can. Take the peculiar case of the Royals, with only 
$5 million in rights fees. Weep not for the Royals -- at least as long as owner 
Ewing Kauffman is there. Kauffman is a generous, civic-minded septuagenarian 
who built a billion-dollar fortune in pharmaceuticals. He wants to win so badly 
that he will spend obscenely to make Kansas City proud. 
</P>
<P>
So what if bestowing millions of dollars last year on pitchers Mark Davis and 
Storm Davis proved to be a bust? Since November, he has signed pitcher Mike 
Boddicker for three years at $9.25 million, outfielder-designated hitter Kirk 
Gibson for two years at $3.3 million, and left-hander Dan Schatzeder for a year 
at $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank the good Lord every day Mr. Kauffman's here," Burke says. "He's not 
operating the ballclub for his own profit. We lost money in 1990 and we've 
assured him we'll lose money in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
So profoundly does Kauffman want to win that he does what other fabulously 
well-to-do owners won't: He subsidizes player signings with his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
Says Burke: "We can't compete with other teams as far as our income, so we have 
to have an owner willing to spend his own money. We don't pass higher salary 
costs on to the fans. We pass it on to Mr. Kauffman." 
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh, however, the thought of going back to the team's partners is 
unconscionable, says Barger. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't subsidize the team," he says. "We won't go back to them for 
operating capital." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, when the Pirates' bill for future free-agents Bobby Bonilla and Andy 
Van Slyke comes due next year and the bill for Barry Bonds and Doug Drabek 
comes due in 1992, Barger will play with fiscal fire if they pay all four what 
they're worth, or community fire if they let their corps of stars depart. 
Already, the Pirates have allowed free-agents Sid Bream and R.J. Reynolds to 
leave for the Braves and Japan, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"If I said every one of our players will be with us, I'd be frivolous," Barger 
says. "We have a strategy that we hope will keep us competitive." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, small-market teams such as the Pirates, Braves, Royals and Reds must 
find ways to resist the impulse to bid on free agents the way such big-market 
giants as the Dodgers, Angels and Mets do. Developing a productive minor league 
system is certainly the alternative, but free agents are so tempting when a 
team has a hole tailor-made for the right free-agent veteran. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' Quinn has a quaint credo -- "Know when to say when!" -- when costs 
butt up against need. Having lost pitcher Danny Jackson, Quinn re-signed 
pitcher Tom Browning for four years at $12.5 million, and second baseman Bill 
Doran for three years at $7.3 million, then chased Zane Smith around the 
financial bases -- but stopped when he felt Smith's agent manipulating the Reds 
to jack up the Pirates' offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanity comes in when you hang up the phone," says Quinn. "I said, 'Consider 
the click of the phone your answer.' We know our fiscal restraints, but you 
have to be man enough to live by them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, adding $19.5 million in new salaries (while shedding Jackson's 
$1.15-million 1990 contract) does not presage the dawn of austerity. 
</P>
<P>
Both players and owners are looking toward a newly named joint economic study 
committee to sort out the future of player compensation. Earlier this year, 
during the 32-day spring training lockout of players, owners proposed a 
revenue-sharing plan. The players balked and the owners shelved the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Any type of revenue-sharing -- modeled partly on the NBA's revenue-sharing and 
salary cap system -- must mediate the disparities in local TV-and-radio income 
between the rich and poor clubs. Persuading the Yankees to pool their 
$50-million-plus in annual rights fees with teams getting $5 million will 
surely be difficult for the have-not owners. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether the study committee, whose members include Paul 
Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, can resolve the knotty 
compensation issues that have roiled baseball's management-labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Volcker wrung inflation out of the national economy in the 1980s. Maybe 
he can find a way to solve baseball's salary inflation in the 1990s.

<LEADPARA>  Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox more than salvaged what had been a stormy
off-season Friday, becoming baseball's highest-paid player.;    The
28-year-old right-handed pitcher agreed to a five-year contract with an
average salary of $5.38 million, which surpasses the previous high, Jose
Canseco's $4.7 million per year for five years with the A's, signed June 27,
1990.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>

<MEMO>  Chart attached to end of article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Canseco and another outfielder, Darryl Strawberry of the Los Angeles
Dodgers ($4.05 million), had been the only players averaging $4 million or
more.;    "Roger made his decision a long time ago that Boston is one of the
four great cities to play baseball in," said Randy Hendricks, one of two
agents who helped Clemens land the contract. "He was up for the challenge.
It's the challenge of getting along with the media, the fans and pitching the
Red Sox to their first world championship in 72 years that keeps Roger going.
It gives him the drive to succeed.";    That drive to succeed, which helped
Clemens to a 21-6 record in 1990, got Clemens in trouble in the fourth game of
the American League playoffs last year in Oakland. He was ejected from Game 4
during a run-in with umpire Terry Cooney as the A's completed a sweep of the
Red Sox. He was fined $10,000 and faces a five-game suspension this season.
Clemens' off-field problems include a Feb. 20 arraignment hearing in Houston
on charges of aggravated assault on a Houston police officer as a result of an
early morning incident at Bayou Mama's nightclub Jan. 19.;    Despite those
problems, Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman had predicted late last week the
contract would be agreed upon by this week.;    "I think the club had a
realistic view of how much it would take to sign Roger from the beginning,"
Gorman said. "We recognized that we were dealing with the best pitcher in
baseball. We didn't take his off-field problems into consideration seriously,
because we feel they will get resolved and Roger performs for us on the field
and donates much of his time to charitable causes in the area.";    Clemens,
who earns $2.5 million this season, the final year of his current three-year,
$7.5 million deal, received a $621,000 signing bonus that will be paid when he
officially signs. In 1992, Clemens will earn $4.4 million, followed by $4.5
million in 1993, $5 million in 1994 and $5.5 million in 1995. Clemens' option
year calls for $6 million in 1996. But the Red Sox can buy out his contract
for $1.5 million in '96.;    The Red Sox can exercise the '96 option after the
1991 or 1992 season at $5.5 million. If they wait until after 1993, the salary
would rise to $5.8 million. From the 1994 season on, the option shifts from
the team to Clemens, whose salary at that point would be $6 million.;    The
Red Sox have gone on a winter-long spending spree. They have committed more
than $73.2 million over the next five years to six major signings this
winter.;    Clemens' contract marked another step in the vast escalation of
salaries over the past 16 months. Minnesota outfielder Kirby Puckett became
the first $3 million-a-year player on Nov. 22, 1989, and Clemens became the
34th to reach that level.;    Nolan Ryan got the first $1 million-a-year
contract in November 1979, and George Foster became the first $2 million
player in February 1982.;    When told of Clemens' contract, Baltimore Orioles
General Manager Rollie Hemond, whose team payroll for last year and this year
will be about $5 million short of Clemens' contract, said, "I guess I'm at a
loss for words. I can think back to my Milwaukee days when Warren Spahn made
$60,000 after winning 20 just about every year. (John) Quinn would say, 'Well,
he's paid to win 20.' Sure, it's mind-boggling, but it seems every day there's
a bigger one.";  Baseball's highest paid;  Player                  Team

TALKS: PLAYERS REJECT VINCENT'S THREE-PART PROPOSAL. BOTH SIDES SAY THEY AREN'T 
CLOSE TO NEW AGREEMENT AS SPRING TRAINING LOCKOUT LOOMS.

<P>
The players union dismissed Commissioner Fay Vincent's proposal at the stalled 
baseball talks as a step backward Wednesday, ruining hopes of a breakthrough on 
the eve of a spring training lockout by owners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not progress," said Phil Bradley, one of the players attending a strategy 
session at the union office. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, camps will not open as scheduled today, when pitchers, catchers and 
injured players were to start reporting in Florida and Arizona. Negotiations 
resume this morning in New York, but the two sides say they aren't close to a 
new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Union chief Donald Fehr spoke negatively of Vincent's proposal, which had 
raised hopes the day before. Fehr, who did not reject the plan outright, said 
it had three components: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A system of minimum salaries for players with less than three years in the 
majors and a 75% cap on increases in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A two-year study committee on revenue sharing and a provision that the 
four-year labor agreement could be reopened by management after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No increase in the benefit plan covering health care costs and player 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent presented his plan during meetings Monday and Tuesday as a replacement 
for the owners' revenue sharing and pay-for-performance proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a change of approach, but not something we would seriously consider," 
Paul Molitor of Milwaukee said. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, using the phrase of union lawyer Gene Orza, said Vincent's proposal was 
progress only because "we're now talking in the same ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Under Vincent's plan, players with less than one year in the majors would have 
a $75,000 minimum salary, players with less than two years a $125,000 minimum, 
and players with less than three years a $200,000 minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he believed the minimums would become club-imposed standards. If that 
were true, three-plus players would have a $350,000 limit, four-plus players a 
$612,500 limit and five-plus players a top of $1,071,875. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fought the battle on salary caps before," said Fehr, who called the 
new proposal a request for givebacks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980 and 1985, owners proposed 100% caps on raises for players in salary 
arbitration and each time withdrew the proposal after stiff opposition from the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average increase for players who filed for arbitration was 70%. 
Some players receive increases way above the average. San Diego catcher Benito 
Santiago got a 262% increase Wednesday and Angel pitcher Bob McClure last month 
settled his case with a 313% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that he preferred not to talk about his plan other than at the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me I am better off talking at the table," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orza attacked the proposal as "regressive." Orza said he interpreted it as 
management saying, "We're making more so we will give you less." 
</P>
<P>
Management negotiator Chuck O'Connor, speaking later at baseball's executive 
offices, declined to get into the specifics of the proposal. But he said the 
option to terminate after two years was meant to protect teams from an economic 
downturn in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) is an attempt to insulate the clubs from problems that will come to pass 
before four years," O'Connor said. "In other words, to give them an out." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who had a conference call Wednesday with the six owners on the Player 
Relations Committee, said that while the revenue-sharing proposal was being put 
aside for now, owners still saw it as the future of baseball's labor-management 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to very much get into that mode," he said.

The players' union, which dismissed Commissioner Fay Vincent's offer to open 
training camps in exchange for a no-strike pledge, and team owners appear 
headed in different directions with the scheduled opening day of the season 
just 24 days away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect we'll get together this weekend, " Chuck O'Connor, the club 
owners chief negotiator said today at a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably won't be until the beginning of next week." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball club owners, accused by the players of concentrating more on public 
relations than ending the lockout of major league camps, today held a news 
briefing to explain their latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Player Relations Committee said the owners' latest proposal would raise the 
salary of players with more than two and less than three years' service an 
average of $60,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the labor dispute has been salary arbitration. The union wants 
players with two years of service eligible for arbitration, while the owners 
want to keep the current system that makes players wait for three seasons 
before they can seek arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The Players Assn. scheduled an afternoon news conference to discuss the dispute 
that has resulted in a 23-day spring training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent failed in a bid Thursday to bring the sides together. 
The owners agreed to his plan but the union dismissed it as a "staged media 
event." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to salvage Opening Day on April 2, Vincent asked the 26 club owners to 
open the camps in Florida and Arizona if the players would pledge not to strike 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Owners agreed within moments, but union chief Don Fehr refused to even dignify 
the idea. Without explicitly rejecting the overture, Fehr complained that 
owners failed to formally notify him. He said if they ever did, he would 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate we are at this place," Fehr said, blistering his foes with 
sarcastic references to press releases and their "terrificly successful 
lockout." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a proposal," he said. "If it was a proposal, they would have told 
us about it first. They didn't bother to tell us about it first, 'cause they 
know the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Added union official Gene Orza, "No self-respecting union gives away the right 
to strike." 
</P>
<P>
The union's response darkened the outlook for playing Opening Day as scheduled. 
Bud Selig, Milwaukee Brewers owner and chairman of management's labor 
committee, said the lockout would remain in place unless the union offered a 
no-strike pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr gave no such pledge, but he refused to rule out further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Yaverbaum of New York, co-founder of Strike Back, an organization founded 
in the 1985 labor dispute, said his group has received 9,200 letters from "very 
aggravated baseball fans."

FT  16 DEC 94 / Strike impasse dashes hopes for a new start to baseball

<TEXT>
Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season
short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will
start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league
form.
Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to
declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law
that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries.
The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management
of failing to bargain in good faith. This would lead to an investigation by
the National Labour Relations Board, the independent federal agency, which
could last two months.
The NLRB has already sided with the players on a related issue by announcing
that it has filed a complaint that the owners improperly withheld Dollars
7.8m (Pounds 5m) in contributions to the players' pension fund due on August
1, less than two weeks before the strike started.
Last week the department of Labour certified the dispute as official, thus
clearing the way for the union to petition the government not to grant visas
to non-American players, mostly from Latin America, whom the owners have
threatened to import as substitutes, along with minor league players, in an
attempt to get some kind of season under way next year.
There had been some hope earlier this week that the latest round of
negotiations was making progress on alternatives to a pure salary cap as the
best means of sharing revenues more equitably between rich and poor clubs.
Modified proposals by the owners on taxing team payrolls had not been
dismissed out of hand by the players, but no agreement proved possible.
With spring training due to start in 10 weeks, there has been no break in
player solidarity, though public opinion now tends to blame them more than
the owners for the problems of the country's national sport. Some owners
have expressed misgivings about sacrificing another season, but the majority
seem determined to let the confrontation run its course.

<HL> Outspoken Agent Is Focal Point in Battle
Between Baseball Owners and the Players
---
By Hal Lancaster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 05/01/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    From the beach, a visitor
winds his way up the hill, then ascends the steep front steps
to the stark aerie of Dick Moss, baseball player agent. It is
not unlike scaling the Himalayas in search of a guru, and
there are those in the sport who say that's pretty much the
way Mr. Moss sees it.
   As the current economic war between baseball owners and players escalates, Mr. Moss has become a focal point for controversy and an all-around pain in the neck to the game's establishment. 
This past winter, he haggled with clubs on behalf of some of the most prominent free agents available. 
Along the way, he negotiated with owners through the news media, leveled accusations of conspiracy and generally angered team executives. 
It was a "perfect example of why so many people in baseball intensely dislike the man," fumed Dallas Green, Chicago Cubs president, during the talks. 

   Mr. Moss, looking tanned and comfortable in an open-necked shirt, says he is taken aback by such criticism, which he sees as another front in management's battle with labor. 
That battle has been highlighted by owners' almost total refusal to bid on other teams' high-priced free agents. 
To Mr. Moss, this smacks of collusion among owners to reduce payrolls by preventing an open market. 
The players have filed grievances to that effect. 

   This spring, however, an apparent victory by the owners has left Mr. Moss and other agents worried about their livelihoods. 
In 1986, agents argued that a few coveted players could have broken owners' resistance if the players had simply extended their holdouts. 
This year, some players did just that -- but owners didn't budge. 
Today, the first day that unsigned free agents can legally return to their old teams, most will, proving that agents were wrong. 

   Now, some agents are discussing the possibility of forming a new league to spur bidding for players. 
Mr. Moss hints that some "substantial people" are talking about starting the rival league as soon as next year. 

   He insists that owners are trying to drive a wedge between players and their representatives with vitriolic personal attacks. 
"I've seen the minutes of general managers' meetings where they're asking, 'How do we make the agents look bad?'" 
Mr. Moss charges. (Bill Lajoie, vice president and general manager of the Detroit Tigers, insists that "I've never attended a general managers' meeting, to my recollection, where that took place.") 

   It's easy to see how the 55-year-old Mr. Moss could raise hackles. 
He is anything but shy about his accomplishments and loves to incite the opposition with calculatedly inflammatory remarks, the residue of a life on the labor battlements. 
The Harvard-educated lawyer spent six years on the legal staff of the Steelworkers Union in his hometown of Pittsburgh before joining the Major League Baseball Players Association as general counsel in 1967. 
The association was little more than a "company union" then, Mr. Moss recalls. 
All that changed in the next turbulent decade, with Mr. Moss in an instrumental role as the lawyer who won arbitration cases that abolished baseball's reserve clause, which bound a player to one team. 

   He left the union in 1977 "just to show all those agents how it should be done," he says with a defiant smirk. 
And, by his own account, he has done just that, negotiating the first $1 million contract (for pitcher Nolan Ryan of the Houston Astros in 1979) and winning the first $1 million arbitration award (for pitcher Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1982). 

   "There's no question he's a bright person," says Barry Rona, executive director of the Player Relations Council, the owners' labor arm. 
"He's also a bigger pain and more annoying to the players union than he is to the clubs." 
Because of his historic union role, Mr. Rona says, "Dick believes he's entitled to preeminent treatment from the players union; he's constantly reminding them that he's the champion of free agency. 
In scheduling arbitration hearings, he wants certain dates, certain places, certain arbitrators and God forbid if they don't cater to his desires." 

   Mr. Moss responds that he is only fighting for his clients. 
Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, adds: "Barry (Rona's) view of the world is that if you're vigorously representing your client, you're a pain in the neck." 

   Team officials, of course, are less than enamored of Mr. Moss. 
Sandy Alderson, vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland Athletics, was quoted as saying, "If Dick Moss represented Babe Ruth I wouldn't talk to him." 
Mr. Alderson cites Mr. Moss's unsuccessful grievance on behalf of former outfielder Steve Henderson, in which he accused the team of conspiring to lock the player out of the market. 

   To Mr. Moss, all this is part of the game he loves, haggling for an edge, any edge, with management. 
And he was never in finer form than this past winter, when he presided over veritable media caravans on behalf of pitcher Jack Morris and outfielder Andre Dawson and perhaps, brought the owners' lockout into sharper focus. 
Although Mr. Moss insists he is simply trying to get his clients the best contract, Mr. Alderson echoes the belief among owners that "Dick has a broader agenda." 

   After four teams rejected Mr. Moss's offer to pick their own terms, Mr. Morris eventually resigned with his old team -- the Detroit Tigers -- for $1.85 million a year, almost double his 1986 pay. 
But Mr. Moss wasn't as successful in the Dawson case. 
Mr. Dawson wanted to move from the Montreal Expos' artificial turf to the Chicago Cubs' softer natural grass to preserve his gimpy knees. 
After contentious negotiations prompted Cubs President Green to demand an apology from Mr. Moss for accusing Cubs management and baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth of conspiring to prevent the team from signing Mr. Dawson, Mr. Moss finally offered him a blank contract and told him to fill in whatever salary he deemed fair. 
Mr. Green deemed $500,000 fair -- almost half what the star outfielder made in 1986 -- and threw in an extra $150,000 if Mr. Dawson's knees hold up. 
Mr. Moss hopes to make up for the cut next year, when the player is eligible for arbitration. 

   Clearly, Mr. Moss says, the owners are "teaching free agents a lesson: If you become a free agent, nobody will make you an offer, and it might end your career." 
And next year, Mr. Moss says, there are rumors that owners will attempt to gut the despised salary-arbitration process by refusing to offer contracts to those eligible for it. 
That would make them free agents with nowhere to go. 

   Hope lingers, he says, in hearings on the players' grievances, which are proceeding this week. 
The arbitrator could award damages, order salary arbitration for free agents or void the labor agreement, among other things. 
Mr. Moss, with his eye ever on the big jackpot, at least hopes for a finding that the owners violated the agreement, which would allow the players to file an antitrust suit. 
Baseball's long-held exemption from antitrust laws will be overturned someday, he says, and "maybe this is the right case."

CLEMENS AGREES TO $7.5-MILLION DEAL FOR 3 YEARS;

<P>
Baseball's top salary reached another record Wednesday when Roger Clemens, a 
two-time Cy Young Award winner, avoided arbitration and agreed to a three-year, 
$7.5-million contract with the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens will get a $300,000 signing bonus, $2.2 million this season, $2.5 
million in 1990 and $2.5 million in 1991. In addition, he can earn $350,000 per 
year in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The average annual salary of $2.5 million is the largest in baseball history, 
though Clemens will receive only the sixth-highest salary for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But more records may be broken today. Orel Hershiser, the National League Cy 
Young winner and the most valuable player of the playoffs and World Series, is 
scheduled for an arbitration hearing in Los Angeles with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is asking for $2.425 million, which would be the highest salary for 
this year and an arbitration record if he wins. The Dodgers are offering $2 
million in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the players won all three arbitration decisions issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger right-hander Tim Leary was awarded $670,000 by arbitrator Anthony 
Sinicropi rather than the $575,000 offered by the team. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati left-hander Danny Jackson was awarded $1.15 million by Thomas 
Roberts, rather than the $865,000 offered by the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
And New York Mets outfielder Len Dykstra was awarded $575,000 by Frederick Reel 
rather than the $455,000 offered by the club. 
</P>
<P>
Players have won five of the eight cases decided. Texas Rangers outfielder Pete 
Incaviglia and Red pitcher Tom Browning had their cases heard Wednesday. In 
addition to Hershiser, Cincinnati outfielder Eric Davis and San Diego Padres 
right-hander Walt Terrell are to go before arbitrators today. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens said he was happy to avoid arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like going to arbitration because I've heard a lot of negative 
things coming out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens had asked for $2.36 million in arbitration, and Boston had offered $1.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Including a prorated share of the signing bonus, Clemens will get $2.6 million 
each in 1990 and 1991, the highest baseball salary ever. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his salary, Clemens would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the 
Cy Young Award and $50,000 for finishing second. He would get $100,000 for 
winning the American League most valuable player and $50,000 for finishing 
second or third. He would get $50,000 if he is MVP of the AL playoffs and 
$100,000 if he is MVP of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"While it may represent the highest salary per year ever earned in baseball, 
that's not going to last too long in my opinion," said Randy Hendricks, one of 
Clemens' agents. "I believe that salaries are going to continue going up." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly's $2.5 million in 1990 with the New York Yankees was the previous 
high in yearly salary. Eddie Murray of the Dodgers will get $2.8 million in 
1991, but $500,000 is deferred without interest, lowering its present-day value 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
At four years, 142 days of major league service, Clemens reached $2 million 
faster than any other player in history, beating Minnesota's Kirby Puckett by 
five days. Clemens is 78-34 in his major league career and won Cy Young Awards 
after going 24-4 in 1986 and 20-9 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the Red Sox, the key was getting a three-year deal. Clemens would have 
become eligible for free agency after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to commit him to this ballclub for three years and hopefully many 
more," Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said. "He's a major part of our 
ballclub. Equally important, it proves that Roger wants to stay. It's a long 
contract and a big one, so it took some time. We're buying out a year of free 
agency and two years of arbitration. Based on what Gooden got and Hershiser is 
looking for, we felt this was in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden signed a three-year, $6.7-million deal with the Mets last week. 
Hershiser is asking for $8.3 million over three years from the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens' contract was agreed to more amicably than his last one. In 1987, 
Clemens held out and agreed to a two-year deal only after the intervention of 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm just looking to bigger and better things," Clemens said. "I've tried 
to perform at the top level of all the pitchers in the league. I always knew if 
I did the job, everything off the field would take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP 1989 SALARIES 
</P>
<P>
The highest-paid baseball players in 1989. Salaries were obtained by The 
Associated Press from player and management sources and include prorated share 
of signing bonuses. Jim Rice's contract includes income deferred without 
interest, which is discounted to reflect present-day value:

BASEBALL'S TRANQUILITY IS ABOUT TO STRIKE OUT; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT: THE QUAKE-DELAYED WORLD SERIES HAD A UNIFYING EFFECT. COMING TALKS 
MAY HAVE A SHATTERING ONE.

<P>
The tranquility Fay Vincent detected between management and players during the 
earthquake-interrupted World Series is not likely to continue for long, to the 
commissioner's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining toward a basic agreement to replace the one that expires Dec. 31 
will begin here this week with preliminary meetings between the owners' 
negotiating team, the Player Relations Committee and the players' union, the 
Major League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Talks are not expected to intensify until the week of Dec. 10, after management 
finishes conducting its business at the winter meetings Dec. 2 to 7 in 
Nashville, Tenn., and the Players Assn. holds its convention at about the same 
time in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, Player Relations Committee director Barry Rona will 
officially present to Players Assn. director Donald Fehr an outline of a 
proposed revenue sharing plan, the major thrust in the owners' negotiating 
stance. Already, there are rumblings of skepticism about the plan in the 
union's hall. The sides that seldom agree on anything seem to have another item 
upon which to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
At the general managers meetings last week in Palm Springs, Rona outlined the 
preliminary proposal, which calls for what he termed "a working partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Rona's proposal was for management to divide players into two categories: those 
with experience of six seasons or more and those with experience of fewer than 
six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For players in the second group, a pay-for-performance scale would determine 
salaries. Money for that would come from a revenue sharing fund of all 26 
clubs. The percentage of the clubs' revenues to be shared would be negotiated. 
Signing of free agents in the first group would be determined by some form of 
salary cap, although Rona prefers not to use that phrase. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no cap on any player's salary, and there would be no cap on a 
club's payroll," he said. "A club may drive the payroll up to any level, but 
once it reaches a certain plateau it cannot sign other clubs' free agents. 
Clubs must reach the minimum payroll either by doing it on their own or by 
signing free agents, their own players or their own free agents. If not, the 
money must be turned over to the players in a lump sum." 
</P>
<P>
The pay-for-performance scale for players with between zero and six seasons' 
experience would be based on a formula using statistics over two years, similar 
to the Elias Sports Bureau's ranking system to determine compensation for clubs 
losing players to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
The union is critical of management's proposal because it is designed to 
eliminate salary arbitration, a system the Players Assn. wants to continue; the 
association intends to negotiate toward making the system applicable to more 
players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 labor talks, the union agreed to limit salary arbitration to players 
with three or more but fewer than six seasons' experience (players with six or 
more seasons can become free agents).

<TEXT>     Even an all-black team wouldn't hesitate to adopt a nickname such as Grays,
Clowns, X-Giants or Black Yankees.;    It was the time of black baseball in
America -- the Negro leagues and barnstorming teams -- and it lasted from the
1860s, when the Civil War freed the slaves, until the 1960s, when the
civil-rights movement reached its zenith.;    The Negro leagues were the
product of a society not comfortable with itself, and they produced some
extraordinary ballplayers.;    After 1947, when Jackie Robinson became the
first black player in the major leagues, a few of his Negro league
contemporaries also were able to sign on with big league teams. Only a handful
were recognized by the Baseball Hall of Fame.;    It took World War II and the
racial rantings of Adolf Hitler to focus America's attention on its own racial
hypocrisy, according to historian Jules Tygiel of San Francisco State, whose
best-known baseball work is "Baseball's Great Experiment -- Jackie Robinson
and his Legacy.";    Tygiel -- a historian by profession, a baseball historian
by avocation -- has traced evidence of black baseball players to before the
Civil War in an article he wrote for the encyclopedia "Total Baseball," but he
found the first evidence of teams in Northern cities in 1867 when the Brooklyn
Uniques played the Philadelphia Excelsiors in what was billed as the
"championship of colored clubs.";    The same year, the Philadelphia Pythians,
another black club, sent a representative to the organizational meeting of the
National Association of Base Ball Players, which became the first professional
baseball league, according to David Q. Voight's baseball history in "Total
Baseball.";    The Pythians were barred because the association said "if
colored clubs were admitted there would be in all probability some division of
feeling, whereas, by excluding them no injury could result to anyone.";   
That didn't mean professional baseball was an entirely segregated game.;   
All through baseball history there were games, mainly exhibition contests,
played between all-white and all-black teams. And there were integrated teams
in the International Association, a minor league with teams in the northern
United States and Canada as late as 1898.;    A black catcher, Moses Fleetwood
Walker, and his brother Welday helped organize an integrated team at Oberlin
College in 1881, and Fleet Walker later played two seasons for the University
of Michigan.;    Walker, not Jackie Robinson, was the first black major
leaguer when he joined Toledo of the American Association in 1884, according
to Tygiel.;    But black players were gradually driven out of mainstream
professional baseball through the rejection of teammates, ugly incidents and
finally outright banning.;    That was the situation that prompted the
formation of the first of a series of Negro leagues that, at times, paid wages
that topped those of the major leagues.;    The first truly successful league
was the Negro National League founded in 1919, by Rube Foster, a
player-turned-executive. Foster's league spawned others such as the Eastern
Colored League.;    Teams and leagues tended toward financial instability,
however, and the best players jumped from team to team and league to league
without penalty. The strongest black teams, such as the Kansas City Monarchs
and Homestead Grays (Pittsburgh), existed outside formal leagues at times,
barnstorming across the country playing league teams, white teams and any
other opponents that could draw paying crowds.;    Negro league teams made
important contributions to the sport. The Monarchs, one of the longest-lived
and most successful clubs, had a portable lighting system built in 1929, so
they could play as many as three games a day. They played the first night
professional baseball game in 1930, according to Tygiel.;    Tygiel said
seasons ran 200 or more games, many of them exhibitions that didn't count in
league standings. Teams often played their weekend games in major league
parks, welcomed by teams such as the Yankees looking for rental revenue on
days they were on the road.;    In the 1930s and '40s, Negro league teams
frequently played exhibitions against teams of major league all-stars to
sellout crowds of black and white fans. Tygiel's research of interracial games
in the 1930s indicates Negro league teams won two-thirds of the games.;   
Jackie Robinson's acceptance in the major leagues spelled the end of the Negro
leagues, although their death was slow. It wasn't until 1959, 12 years after
Jackie Robinson first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, that the Boston Red Sox
ended the all-white era of the major leagues. The Red Sox were the last team
to integrate their roster.;    The Negro American League shrank from 10 teams
in 1948 to four by 1953. Barnstorming black teams continued to hang on. Kansas
City's last East-West All Star Game between black teams was played in 1963.

   In his Feb. 24 editorial-page article, "The Economics of
Paul Tsongas," Herbert Stein tells us that the $25,000 salary
of a scientific researcher, the $100,000 salary of a lawyer,
the $200,000 paid an investment banker and the $2 million
paid a professional baseball player are all the product of
market economics.
   I hardly think so.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The salaries earned by investment bankers and lawyers are
largely the product of distortions the government has
introduced into the marketplace. The scientific researcher is
probably funded by the public in whole or in part. And even
the baseball player owes his wealth to a government-run
pro-baseball cartel in which the players' union is protected
while owners are prosecuted under antitrust laws for
resisting extortionate salary demands.
   It would be nice if so-called conservatives realized that
nearly every economic decision is influenced by the
government, and that for most of the past 60 years that
influence has been unthinking and undirected when it has not
been downright malign.
   I'm a Republican -- or was until I voted for Ron Paul, the
Libertarian candidate, in 1988 -- and I find at least a ray
of hope in some of the things Paul Tsongas is saying. The
Democratic candidates actually debated on national TV the
prospect of cutting middle-class entitlements. For 12 years
the Reagan-Bush crowd has declined to spend a dime of
political capital on these difficult issues.
   If Mr. Tsongas is a fake, he'll be exposed in due course.
But this year I'm not voting for the Republican "tax
collectors for the welfare state." Herbert Stein had better
go back and study his Adam Smith before lecturing Mr. Tsongas
about the market economy.
   Lee Euler
   Baltimore
   ---
   Mr. Stein's analysis of Mr. Tsongas's economic platform
contains a Randian maxim, and a truth. In a free market we
pay most for what we value most. If a left fielder is paid 80
times the salary of a science researcher, it is by the free
choice of the market. However, a question nags me: What is
the future of a society that holds such values? Is a left
fielder more valuable than a scientist? Ayn Rand might have
asked, "Valuable to whom?" The answer would provide an
objective measure of the morality of the valuer.
   Mr. Stein makes some excellent points as to the health and
growth of the American economy. But to what purpose growth?
The market will respond with equal zeal to our demand for a
new flavor of ice cream and to our want of a cure for a fatal
disease.
   I would remind Mr. Stein that the predictions of prophets
of doom such as Malthus have not been foiled by left
fielders, but by inventors, scientists and engineers.

   Around Christmas 1965, some Major League baseball
veterans, concerned about the game's pension plan, determined
that the association that had been representing them in a
desultory manner should be beefed up by the hiring of a
full-time executive director. To that end, they arranged an
interview with Marvin Miller, a well-regarded bargainer for
the United Steelworkers of America.
   At the outset of his new book, "A Whole Different Ball
Game: The Sport and Business of Baseball" (Birch Lane Press,
430 pages, $21.95), Mr. Miller relates that at the meeting
the players informed him that if he were hired they had in
mind someone to assist him as general counsel: Richard M.
Nixon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With such a mind-set, it was remarkable that the players
would offer the job to a hard-core unionist like Mr. Miller.
And, given that glimpse into the baseball psyche, it's more
remarkable that he took it (without, as it turned out,
committing himself to accepting the aid and comfort of Mr.
Nixon).
   Most remarkable, though, was the association's record
during the Brooklyn-born economist's 17 years as its leader,
ending in 1983. During his tenure, impartial arbitration was
substituted for owner-imposed settlements of grievances, the
"reserve clause" that bound a player to his team at the
team's pleasure was ruled invalid, and the player salary
average began its rocketlike ascent from $19,000 to today's
nearly $900,000. It's certainly a whole different ball game,
in ways that still are evolving.
   Mr. Miller's book, written with the help of Allen Barra,
details the struggles that led to those gains, and these were
remarkable, too. To say the owners had things their own way
before he came along would be an understatement. The lords of
the baseball were (and still are) exempt from the nation's
antitrust laws, never gave the players copies of many of the
documents that bound them, and, when they felt changes were
in order, simply had their appointed commissioner announce
them unilaterally. A player running afoul of the game's
powers-that-be was in the same situation as a stranger
arrested in "one of those tiny towns where the sheriff also
turns out to be the judge and the mayor," Mr. Miller writes.
   Moreover, as he notes in several contexts, some of the men
he represented were ignorant of or hostile to the role of
unions in protecting workers' interests, and many were
apathetic over issues they perceived as not directly
involving them. For instance, no player showed up in court to
give moral support to Curt Flood in his 1970 legal assault on
the reserve clause, or to hear arguments in the owner's
(unsuccessful) suit to overturn the five-years-later
arbitrator's ruling that killed the infamous rule and allowed
the players to flex their market muscle.
   But he goes on to say that years of labor strife in
baseball, including the strike of 1972 and the lockout of
1976, paid off in player solidarity during the 50-day, 1981
walkout over the owners' bid for "warmbody" compensation for
lost free agents. Given the fact that most players never
perform long enough to attain free agency, Mr. Miller calls
the '81 strike the "most-principled" he'd been associated
with in a 40-plus-year labor career.
   Mr. Miller opines that his union did have allies, but not
ones you'd expect. Team owners, he says, always could be
counted upon to do or say things that would stiffen members'
backbones at crucial times.
   He continues that the players' best friend -- next to
himself, of course -- was Bowie Kuhn, baseball's commissioner
for most of his time with the players' group. Mr. Miller's
low regard for and asserted gratitude to the starchy Mr. Kuhn
punctuates his book. "If Bowie Kuhn had never existed," he
summarizes, paraphrasing Voltaire on God, "we would have had
to invent him."
   That view is payback for Mr. Kuhn's assessment of Mr.
Miller in his 1987 book, "Hardball," in which he called the
union chief "sly," a "mean-spirited badger," and -- insult of
insults -- "not a fan." Marvin, however, one-ups Bowie by
making him seem pathetic as well as inept. I mean, where else
in the annals of labor relations has a management rep (Kuhn)
been depicted as approaching a union negotiator (Miller)
before contract talks and asking for leniency because "the
owners need a victory"?
   Such lack of sportsmanship is only one bone I have to pick
with this book. Mr. Miller repeatedly lumps news people as
the owners' lackeys when my own observation was that his
union's positions received a fair airing from much of the
press. And he spends much space defending his credentials as
a baseball fan instead of merely noting that they were
irrelevant to the job he was hired to perform.
   It's clear, though, that the players did better than they
knew when they hired Mr. Miller, and his story is well worth
our attention. He brought to a very public enterprise the
sort of honestly adversarial relationship between labor and
management that we hold up as desirable, and that benefits us
all.

   I wish I could remember who -- wrote, "There's no sport righter than a sportswriter." 
It's a cute line, but untrue. 
In fact, there's no sport righter than a baseball commissioner. 

   If you doubt that, pick up "Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner" (Times Books, 453 pages, $19.95) by Bowie Kuhn. 
In 15 years as occupant of the august post (1969-84), Mr. Kuhn never made a bum decision. 
Who says so? 
Why, Mr. Kuhn, of course. 

   That never-wrong posture was easily the most irritating aspect of lawyer Kuhn's tenure as Major League baseball's chief executive. 
In private conversation, he could be canny, pleasant and witty, and display the sort of self-deprecating humor that is rare among pooh-bahs of sport or other fields. 
The public man, however, was capable of carrying out the most blatant nonsense with an air of perfect rectitude. 
Who but Bowie Kuhn, for instance, could sit serenely outdoors in bone-chilling cold at one of the first World Series night games (a Kuhn innovation!) wearing just a business suit, while all about him huddled in greatcoats? 

   "Hardball" is, in part, a conference-room history of the Kuhn years in Major League baseball. 
On this level it succeeds, although I suspect it contains more information than most people want to know about what went on behind closed doors when club owners lit their big cigars. 

   The book also is a payback for a lengthy list of people whom Mr. Kuhn believes did him -- and the National Pastime -- wrong during his regime. 
It is not surprising that his No. 1 bad guy is Marvin Miller, who, as head of the player's union, was his leading public antagonist. 

   What is surprising is the lack of grace (sportsmanship?) with which Mr. Kuhn appraises his foe. 
According to Mr. Kuhn, Mr. Miller was "pedantic, fussy over details and unwilling to deal straightforwardly with issues." 
He was "sly . . . a mean-spirited badger" and -- worst of all -- "not a fan" (gasp!). 

   Most astonishingly, he describes the man who repeatedly bested his owner-employers in negotiations as "not good at the bargaining table." 
Mr. Kuhn appears not to have read the table on page 169 of his own book, which details a sevenfold increase (to $325,000) in the annual salaries of the Miller-led players between 1976 and 1984. 
Mr. Miller was just lucky, I guess. 

   A similar sourness of grapes mars Mr. Kuhn's version of the overturning of the infamous Reserve Clause, which bound a baseball player to his team without recourse from the time he signed his first professional contract until he was traded or left the game. 
That system fell not because of the law or simple fairness, Mr. Kuhn writes, but because of the "anti-management bias" of Peter Seitz, the arbitrator whose decision began its demise. 

   Mr. Kuhn says he could have negotiated a better free-agent system than the one that emerged following Mr. Seitz's ruling, but he doesn't say what that might have been, or why he didn't propose it when it might have done some good. 

   More entertaining, but no less puzzling, is Mr. Kuhn's account of his battles with Charlie Finley, the profane, cantankerous owner of the Oakland A's during the 1960s and '70s. 
You remember Charlie; he was the guy with the mule, the orange baseball, and all those pennants and World Series titles. 
He had to sell his club after free agency hit and Mr. Kuhn set a $400,000 lid on the price he could get for his stars from other teams before they hit the road on their own. 

   Why $400,000? 
It was the price Mr. Finley had set for the sale of a so-so relief pitcher, and thus was "handy." 
Also, a higher figure would have "undermined public confidence" in club integrity. 
Thus spake Bowie, who, by the way, detested Mr. Finley. 

   Mr. Kuhn goes down the list of his other "controversial" decisions, most of which, he assures us, were arrived at only after Nixonesque agonizing. 
Shopping-center developer Edward DeBartolo was denied the right to buy the Chicago White Sox because he was an out-of-towner and had race-track interests, even though other team owners shared those characteristics and most Chicagoans would have welcomed the infusion of his big bucks. 
Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays couldn't decorate spring-training batting cages because they were casino greeters. 

   An aging Hank Aaron, a swing or two from Babe Ruth's career-home-run record, couldn't be held out of an early season road game so he could break the mark before home fans in Atlanta. 
The "reputation of the game" demanded that he play, ruled Mr. Kuhn. 

   Indeed, the most irksome aspects of this book are Mr. Kuhn's constant references to "public" or "fan" interests to justify his rulings, and his wrapping his decisions in the banner of "baseball" the way others use the flag. 
To hear Mr. Kuhn tell it, arbitrator Seitz's freeing of the players was an offense against "baseball," not just the owners who employed him. 

   In fact, "baseball" has a life in parks and schools all over the world, quite apart from the doings in the Majors. 
At times, it seems to thrive despite, rather than because of, what the big fellas are up to.

<TEXT>
   The professional-football strike, which almost nobody expected and nobody professes to want, is here, and we fans are left with but two alternatives. 
We can sit around gnashing our teeth, or find ways to enjoy our new-found Sunday freedom. 

   Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, a blunt but usually sensible man, suggests the latter course. 
"Check out the price of boats," he told the Chicago Tribune. 
"There's a nice lake out there." 
That sounded like good advice even if one isn't fortunate enough to live along the sunny shores of Lake Michigan. 
If nothing else, it's easier on the teeth than gnashing. 

   While we are out sailing, though, we might ponder what the strike is all about, and what it says about the games we love. 
In fact, those questions might consume more than just a Sunday afternoon, because neither admits to an easy answer. 

   To hear both the National Football League players and owners tell it, the strike is about free agency, or the ability of players to perform for teams of their own choosing. 
The players want it because they think it will enrich them. 
The owners oppose it for the same reason. 

   Further examination, however, suggests that things might not be that simple. 
The pro footballers had theoretical free agency for a time as a result of a court decision striking down the so-called Rozelle Rule, which allowed the commissioner to set compensation in player-movement cases. 
But the union bargained it away in return for a union-security clause and other concessions. 

   A modified form of free agency was negotiated in 1977, but just one player has changed uniforms as a result, and you're a real trivia ace if you can name him. 
Owners say that's because the draft-choice compensation they must pay for a free agent is too steep, but another explanation is that they have decided, individually or collectively, not to vie for the available bodies. 

   In a remarkable coincidence, an arbitrator ruled on Monday -- the day before the football strike -- that Major League baseball team owners had violated their labor agreement by colluding to snub free agents in 1985. 
Damages weren't set, however, and a remedy that could aid future free-agent baseballers might be hard to come by. 
Given the football owners' record of bidding restraint, prospects for grafting the laudable institution onto the gridiron sport aren't bright no matter what a contract says. 

   Some players, probably the ones who read the newspapers, have been outspoken in the belief that free agency ain't the be-all and end-all their union makes it out to be. 
"In baseball, you've had superstars like (Detroit Tigers pitcher) Jack Morris out there, and no one bidding on him. 
What makes you think anyone would bid for bums like me?" said David Huffman, a veteran offensive guard for the Minnesota Vikings. 
"I'm more concerned about getting a bigger piece of the pie." 

   So, if you eliminate free agency as the strike's true engine, you've got the normal mix of ingredients in the labor-management stew (wage scales, pensions, injury benefits and the like) and the intangible but nonetheless vital matter of winning or losing. 
Again, the history of labor relations in football is instructive. 
The two sides have reasoned together five times, and the result has been four strikes -- in 1968, '70, '74 and '82 -- in addition to the present one. 
The weight-room adage of "no pain, no gain" seems to apply. 

   The problem from the players' standpoint is that while they've undergone the pain, they haven't realized the gains. 
By most judgments they are 0-5 in their tilts with the owners, and it was mainly the bidding war with the short-lived U.S. Football League, not the fruits of labor negotiations, that boosted the average annual salary in the NFL to about $200,000 from $90,000 in '82. 
And even at that level, football pay lags well behind that of baseball and basketball. 

   Why the football union has failed where other sports unions have succeeded is a matter of surmise. 
Leadership, or the lack of it, certainly has been a factor. 
Suffice it to say that the players' desire to break their long losing streak might well be the overlooked factor in this go-around. 

   By any rational standard, the football strike should be among the least of our concerns, and the usual radio-talk-show rantings shouldn't obscure Joe Fan's short memory. 
Baseball bounced back from its 1981 strike to set attendance records, and the fact that the NFL gate hasn't quite recovered from the 57-day players' walkout of 1982 -- the only one that disrupted regular-season play -- probably has as much to do with high ticket prices and full stadiums in many cities as fan disaffection. 

   Rooting for a team, though, has always been like enjoying a motion picture in that it requires a suspension of disbelief. 
At the movies, you must block from your mind the thought that cameras are grinding a few feet from the actors. 
Wholehearted sports partisanship requires the no-less-difficult conviction that our favorites and their bosses are as devoted as we to the cities they represent and the outcome of the games at hand. 

   In recent years we have witnessed a string of events that have punctured that conviction. 
The floating-franchise phenomenon heads the list, but athlete drug use and recurring labor-management strife are close behind. 
The football owners' insistence that they will field pickup teams if the walkout doesn't end soon would be another, and a grievous one. 
To date, at least, attendance has held up well enough, but sports crowds are less forgiving than they used to be -- more businesslike, if you will. 
As the bonds of allegiance break, we become more like our erstwhile heroes, and their employers.

   Let the games begin. 

   Not professional football games, of course. 
Those contests -- at least with the National Football League's regular players -- ended Monday night when the league went on strike. 

   Rather, the games now getting under way are those between the players and team owners in their contract talks, and those among the NFL, the television networks and the big advertisers who grease the whole television machine. 

   Should players and owners resolve their gripes in the next day or two, everybody will be having a good laugh about all this at next week's tailgate parties in stadium parking lots across the country. (The two sides met for 90 minutes yesterday and are scheduled to meet again today.) 

   But if the strike drags on anywhere near the 57 days of the 1982 strike, a lot of people along New York's Madison Avenue and "Broadcast Row," homes to the major advertisers and television networks, will be standing on line to renegotiate contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The brunt of that financial burden will ultimately fall on the NFL. 

   Major financial pressure to settle the strike will come from the three major television networks and ESPN Inc., a sports cable programming service. 
In March, they collectively agreed to pay $1.43 billion over three years for football broadcasting rights. 
The strike isn't expected to seriously hurt short-term network profits, however. 

   The networks are already scrambling to fill their schedules for Sunday and beyond. 
CBS Inc. says it is prepared to rebroadcast last January's Super Bowl game this Sunday, while National Broadcasting Co. plans to air baseball games Sunday. 
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. plans to broadcast a movie in place of its popular Monday Night Football. 

   Why have the football powers-that-be taken away America's weekly pigskin fix? 
Mostly, it has come down to the issue of free agency. 
The players' union originally made a complex proposal with interlocking demands and steadfastly denied that free agency -- the right of players to sell their services to the highest bidder -- was the most important issue. 

   But as the strike deadline approached and passed, even Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association, found himself talking more and more about free agency and less about everything else. 
And Jack Donlan, executive director of the NFL Management Council, said that everything currently on the table is negotiable -- except free agency. 

   The owners have proposed liberalizing the current method of free-agent compensation. 
But junking the entire system? 
Never, says Mr. Donlan. 
Average player salaries, he says, have already jumped to $230,000 from $90,000 in 1982. 

   The owners' fear of free agency is twofold: Should teams bid willy-nilly on free agents, as baseball owners did, they could find themselves wallowing in red ink, as baseball owners did. 
If they refuse to sign free agents, as baseball owners did, they could find themselves on the legal griddle, as baseball owners do. 
Unlike their baseball brethren, however, the NFL owners don't enjoy total antitrust exemption, and would thus face an antitrust suit and the possibility of paying treble damages. 
Baseball's grievances are arbitrated. 

   "They feel they would fare much worse in the courts and that it is better to fight it out in a labor context," says Louis Guth, senior vice president of National Economic Research Associates Inc., a White Plains, N.Y., market research company that has done much sports work. 

   Ironically, the strike was announced the same day as an arbitrator's finding that baseball owners violated their labor agreement with players by conspiring to close down the free-agent market. 
Later that day, the NFL Management Council issued a statement that said, in part: "Today's decision by a baseball arbitrator strengthens our commitment to a settlement without the unrestricted free agency demanded by the Players Association." 

   Nevertheless, both sides will feel considerable economic pressure for an early settlement from the various constituencies affected. 

   NFL owners insist that the league's schedule will be suspended for one week and then resume with teams staffed by previously cut free agents and other assorted couch potatoes -- including, owners hope, some current stars who have threatened to cross the picket line. 
Expect the relentlessly efficient, computerized Dallas Cowboys to dominate these games; they already have a full team drilling, while some rivals have yet to sign a player. 

   Will America watch the games? 
In two separate polls taken recently, more than 60% said they would. 
Teams will offer refunds to ticket holders who ask. 
Most will also offer refunds to luxury-box holders, who represent the largest chunk of unshared revenue in the largely socialistic NFL. Disgruntled corporate lessees could weaken the owners' resolve. 

   In Miami, Dolphins owner Joe Robbie used the $12 million of guaranteed revenue from its 10-year leases on luxury boxes and less-expensive executive-level seats to finance his new $102 million stadium. 
He could become financially stretched by a long strike. 
Indeed, the Dolphins have indicated that they won't provide refunds to those preferred seat holders because the money has been used as collateral for stadium-construction loans. 

   The New England Patriots, plagued by heavy losses and debt and on the auction block for more than a year, know that a long strike "will obviously hurt them financially," says a team spokesman. 
But he points out a mitigating factor: the significant savings on player costs. 

   Michael Duberstein, research director for the players' union, estimates that the average team spends $837,000 a game on player salaries, plus $17,000 in player fringe benefits. 
An additional $200,000 in expenses will probably be saved each game, he says. 
But the strike could cost each team a big chunk of the $1.9 million it takes in each week from national television money, gate receipts, luxury boxes, parking and concessions and local radio outlets. 

   Players have also groused about losing big paychecks and, possibly, income from outside endorsements. 
James Steiner, an agent for players, doesn't think that will happen unless the strike "becomes a long, embroiled situation and gets ugly with strikebreaker games and players fighting among themselves." 

   Still, rumors of cracks in the players' claims of solidarity have abounded. 
One rumor -- staunchly denied by all concerned -- is that the Chicago Bears gave the union a week to settle the strike before walking back in. 
Some players, including the Jets' Mark Gastineau, have said they will continue playing. 

   Fans registered their displeasure at Monday night's game by loudly booing the players' pre-game solidarity handshake and chanting "Strike! 
Strike! 
Strike!" after an uninspiring first quarter. 
Fans also registered complaints with their dollars. 
During the 1982 strike, they bought far fewer souvenir items, a small, but growing source of NFL revenue. 
Thomas Shine, president of Logo 7 Inc., a large NFL licensee, estimates that the last strike cost his company $2 million. 

   A battle appears to be brewing over whether the networks will carry the league's nonunion games. 
NFL officials say the networks must carry the games if they are offered, but some network officials say their commitment to carry such games is unclear. 

   Meanwhile, CBS says it is considering college football games, professional golf, boxing matches and sports anthology shows as possible long-term substitutes for NFL games. 
A spokesman for NBC says that, so far, the network has only ruled out picking up games from the Canadian Football League, which NBC did during the 1982 players' strike. 
Beyond Monday, ABC's plans are uncertain, a spokesman says. 
In 1982, ABC broadcast movies throughout the strike. 

   Such network schedule changes likely will throw advertising contracts into turmoil. 
When the networks sell commercial time to advertisers, they typically guarantee them that their messages will reach a certain number of viewers. 
If those targeted audience levels aren't met, the networks must compensate advertisers with free, or "make-good" advertising. 
Advertisers will spend $500 million this year in network advertising to reach the large number of male viewers that professional football attracts. 

   With recent sales of sports advertising time rebounding from stagnant levels of the past two years, network officials report that most commercial time for NFL games is sold out. 
One reason: Network forecasts of larger television audiences for football appear to be on target. 
ABC's first Monday Night Football game scored a strong 41% share of the prime-time audience. 

   But network and advertising officials doubt that nonunion games or substitute programming will attract similar audiences. 
Thus, they are bracing for negotiations on placing make-good advertising in alternative shows -- a move that may be difficult because network advertising is nearly sold out for non-sports programming as well -- or for demands of cash rebates. 

   Network executives say, however, that they are protected from large advertising losses. 
Under the networks' new contract with the NFL, the league must reduce the amount of the broadcast rights fees the networks pay them by the estimated loss of advertising revenue. 
In 1982, the NFL cut its rights fees by $110 million because of the players' strike. 
"It's not easy to identify your estimated losses, however," one network official says. 

   Network executives are more concerned about the long-term effects of a strike. 
They note that after the 1982 strike, viewing levels for football didn't recover to 1981 levels for several seasons, a reduction they attribute in part to fan and audience backlash over the strike. 

   "Nobody is jumping around here excited about what is happening," says a CBS official. 
"It's not going to be fun."

               Battling Over the Free-Agent Issue
   The NFL Players Association has proposed that any player,
after four years of service and regardless of salary, may
become a free agent and sell his services to the highest
bidder. Moreover, the player's new team wouldn't have to
compensate his old team in the form of draft choices. By
contrast, NFL owners propose that players become eligible for
free agency after two years (as it was in the last agreement)
but that teams would still receive some compensation for
losing players under a complicated formula. Some examples:
    Player's Annual Salary:    $120,000
    Years of Service:          4 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               third-round draft choice
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team only
                               has "first-refusal" rights*
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
    ---
    Player's Annual Salary:    $210,000
    Years of Service:          7 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               first-round draft choice
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team receives
                               fifth-round draft choice
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
    ---
    Player's Annual Salary:    $450,000
    Years of Service:          10 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               two first-round draft choices
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team receives
                               one first-round and one
                               second-round draft choice
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
   ---
   *Under the owners' proposal, a free agent's current team
would retain the right of "first refusal," the ability to
match the salary offer of another team under certain
conditions of salary and years of service. The players want
to eliminate first-refusal rights.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOYS OF SUMMER ARE IN FOR A SILENT SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The man in the street may not understand. Not this time. Not with baseball in 
this era of incredible prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
The man in the street wonders how they could shut down his spring training at a 
time when players are making record salaries and owners are raking in record 
profits. For once, won't their loss be worse than his? 
</P>
<P>
What could possibly be wrong with a game that has established attendance 
records six years in a row, has just doubled its national television revenues 
and never has seen so many teams with realistic chances of challenging for 
postseason play? 
</P>
<P>
The man in the street knows the '80s were good to his game. The average annual 
player salary went from $143,756 to $490,000. Attendance almost doubled, and 
virtually every team is aking money. Total industry revenues run around $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The value of franchises increased again and again and again. The Baltimore 
Orioles sold for $12 million in 1979 and for $70 million in 1988. Today, their 
value probably has soared past $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is in such terrific shape that last spring then-Commissioner Peter V. 
Ueberroth asked owners to roll back ticket prices by 75 cents across the board, 
saying it would send fans a message that ownership was willing to share its 
prosperity. He left office two weeks later and no action ever was taken. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, eight different clubs won the World Series during the '80s, and 
22 of the game's 26 teams got into postseason play. Oddly, the Yankees -- a 
team that was supposed to send the competition into oblivion when free agency 
began in 1976 -- failed to win a World Series for the first decade in their 
history. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the game is robust, and not even the owners, who say the current 
salary system must be changed, will argue that. In fact, they say whatever 
problems they face won't come until 1994 or later, years that aren't being 
negotiated in this current labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the game is headed for a shutdown. The owners are expected to announce on 
Friday that they won't unlock spring training gates until a new collective 
bargaining agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that 18 of the 26 owners strongly favor the lockout and don't 
want the game restarted until the players agree to some form of revenue 
sharing. The players, who say that salaries could decrease and free agency 
would be restricted by any form of revenue sharing, are in no mood to give up 
what they have won in court. 
</P>
<P>
Although baseball had work stoppages in 1976, 1981 and 1985, this one is 
different. For once, it's the owners who are ready to shut down the game. For 
once, the players have asked for nothing and likely would accept a roll-over of 
the current agreement. 
</P>
<P>
This, too, is the most complex disagreement because the owners can't articulate 
their problems, especially because almost all agree the current system has 
worked beautifully. When free agency began, dozens of owners warned the game 
would be destroyed by spiraling salaries and that all the good players would 
end up on one team. 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen, and yet, in a sense, that's what the owners are arguing 
again. They are asking the players to come to the bargaining table and agree to 
solve problems that may not exist for several more years, if ever. They are 
saying that if the current salary escalation continues, the competitive balance 
of the game is in jeopardy because teams in smaller television markets won't be 
able to afford the top players. 
</P>
<P>
Teams now devote about 34% of their revenues to salaries. What the owners have 
proposed is that they put 48% of selected revenues -- about 38% of total 
revenues -- into a salary pot. Players with six years of service would still be 
eligible for free agency, but players with less than six years would be paid by 
plugging statistics into a computer, ranking the players and paying them 
according to rank. Leftover dollars would be spent on free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Using statistics to determine salaries always has been tricky business and no 
less than the guru of the 20th Century baseball statistic, Bill James, has said 
that no formula can be devised to determine fair salaries. 
</P>
<P>
But the owners feel they've been burned again and again by arbitration, the 
system by which players in Years 3 through 6 can have their salaries set by an 
independent arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
General managers have a laundry list of horrors about arbitrators who don't 
know what a batting average is or who decide that if George Steinbrenner paid 
Player X $800 million, then Player Y ought to get that money too. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of owners agree with Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, who said, "I 
don't mind paying for my own stupidity, but why should I have to pay for 
someone else's?" 
</P>
<P>
The owners went into these negotiations wanting two changes in the system. 
First, they want an end to salary arbitration. Second, they want to implement a 
form of revenue sharing, a system that appears designed to punish some of the 
free-spending owners more than the players. 
</P>
<P>
Several owners are furious that a few of their colleagues -- George 
Steinbrenner of the Yankees, Gene Autry of the Angels, Joan Kroc of the Padres 
and Avron Fogelman of the Royals -- have almost single-handedly driven up 
salaries for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Ask a dozen people what the eventual solution will be and you'll get a dozen 
different answers. At this point, it appears clear spring training camps won't 
open. The owners' Player Relations Committee has also instructed clubs not to 
let players use their facilities to stay in shape, which means players will be 
shuffled off to haphazard drills at high school fields. 
</P>
<P>
When the lockout begins, the players' union probably will file a grievance with 
the National Labor Relations Board claiming the owners haven't negotiated in 
good faith. They'll say lockout language has been added to contracts for almost 
a year and that the strategy all along was to shut down spring training. 
</P>
<P>
If the owners are ordered to open the camps, the players will have scored a 
significant victory. 
</P>
<P>
A more likely scenario involves what labor disputes almost always come down to: 
a test of wills. How long are the owners prepared to shut down the game? How 
long are the players prepared to wait? Both sides have huge strike funds -- 
$170 million for the owners, $70 million for the players -- and both can afford 
to wait a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they will end up back at the bargaining table, and eventually, 
there will be an agreement. A lot of general managers and agents believe that 
agreement will resemble the current one, and that some form of revenue sharing 
could begin with product licensing money (the two sides are now competitors in 
the marketing of T-shirts and other souvenirs). 
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion is going to play a big role," the agent said. "In the past, the 
players have been the greedy jerks. This time, it's the owners who are shutting 
down the game. It'll be interesting to see how it's played out."

Now watch what happens. Roger Clemens will go 9-15 with a 4.82 earned run 
average, the Boston Red Sox will finish fifth, and his excuse will be that Orel 
Hershiser is getting more money than he is: being only the second-highest-paid 
player in baseball dulls his competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
What we pay gifted young men for the rare privilege and the pure joy of playing 
baseball at the major league level is pathological (so is what we pay rock 
stars, featured actors on "Dallas," chief executive officers who sell out their 
own companies and certain District Court judges, but I prefer to bash one group 
at a time). My favorite pathology is the Philadelphia Phillies shortstop who 
got a raise to $250,000 after hitting .187, down from all of .232 in 1987, 
while his team finished dead last. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, baseball executives are out of their minds. For all the millions the 
Baltimore Orioles are going to shell out this year, the 1989 edition isn't 
going to be much better than if they kept Cal Ripken, Phil Bradley, Brian 
Holton and Dave Schmidt and brought in 20 other guys from Rochester and 
Charlotte at the major-league minimum ($62,500 in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we are raising kids who think that Australia is near the Grand 
Canyon, who will work assembling things conceived and designed in Japan, Korea, 
or Singapore, and who will vote Republican forever. The United States may be 
the first society in history to choose illiteracy deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder, though, when a dedicated teacher can put in 40 years and never 
make in one year what a 20-year-old college dropout can get as a pinch runner. 
You have to be nuts to run a baseball team, and you have to be a saint to be a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
What really bugs me is that every time I go out to Memorial Stadium or even 
watch a ballgame on TV I'm casting a vote for this state of affairs. You spend 
your life loving baseball and remaining faithful, while the jerks in the front 
office and the graceful young ignoramuses on the field reward your devotion 
with increasing contempt. 
</P>
<P>
As greedy as they get, they know you'll keep coming back. You'll pay the 
freight as far as the gravy train wants to go -- because the game on the 
greensward is just too beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I really can't ask anybody to join me in a baseball fans' strike. As soon 
as the weather warms up, and I hear the buttery voice of Jim Palmer or the 
leathery one of Vin Scully, my boycott is over. As far as the eternal 
perfection of baseball is concerned, I'm easy. 
</P>
<P>
But I do have this wicked idea. 
</P>
<P>
How about setting a top individual income at, say, $750,000 a year -- who will 
have the nerve to call this hardship wages? -- and tax anything over it at 90%? 
Put the money in a government fund exclusively earmarked for the doubling of 
teacher salaries. If we pay teachers twice as much, we attract the sort of able 
professional whose idealism is mixed with economic self-respect, and we begin 
to phase out the English teacher who has to go back to school herself to learn 
how to write a clear sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is a major monkey wrench thrown into the mysterious machinery of the 
free market. But you don't have to have a degree from the London School of 
Economics to know that there is something wrong with a free market that values 
a utility infielder more highly than a career public school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a market that is producing a kinder, gentler, fairer, more 
informed, more productive, more civic-spirited America. 
</P>
<P>
So write your congressman, your senators, your state legislators, or clip this 
column and send it to them: Nobody needs to make more than 750 grand a year. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, let's go to spring training with a clear conscience: with as much 
respect for learning as love for baseball.

<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati Reds gave outfielder Eric Davis
a three-year, $9.3 million contract Sunday that includes
performance bonuses that could make him the highest-paid player in
baseball.
   Davis, 27, will make $9.3 million over three years in base
salary, which includes a $1.5 million signing bonus. His agent,
Eric Goldschmidt, said Davis also can make additional performance
bonuses of $250,000 a year for winning Gold Glove, Silver Slugger
and National League Most Valuable Player honors.
   Although the average base salary of $3.1 million leaves Davis
behind Mark Davis' annual salary of $3.25 million as the highest in
baseball, the performance bonuses could boost him above that and
set a new high-water mark.
   Davis won all three honors last season by batting .281 with 34
homers and a career-high 101 runs batted in. He won his third
consecutive Gold Glove, Silver Slugger honors, and was chosen the
team's MVP for a season in which he made roughly $1.5 million.
   ``We trust that the signing of Eric Davis speaks for itself and
becomes a bellwether of things to come and indicates to the
baseball world that the Reds are in the hunt,'' General Manager Bob
Quinn said.
   Davis, a Los Angeles native, said Sunday he wanted to stay in
Cincinnati all along, as long as he could get an agreeable contract.
   ``It's something I wanted to do deep down in my heart, to stay
in Cincinnati,'' Davis said. ``I've always stated that this is my
home away from home.''

   The Parkersburg (W.Va.) News on racism:
   Professional baseball player Jose Canseco's claim he's a victim
of racism should outrage every American. ...
   Canseco plays ... for the Oakland Athletics. After signing a new
contract for the coming year, he had a few words to say to the
press. He was upset the A's didn't agree to pay him more. Canseco
is a Hispanic who came to the United States from Cuba. The reason
he didn't get a better contract is racism, opined Canseco.
   His contract is for $2 million. For one year.
   Various adjectives could be used to describe accurately a $2
million a year contract for a baseball player. ``Racist'' isn't one
of them.
   People who have been victims of racism should be enraged at
Canseco's idiotic, insensitive comment. Leaders of civil rights
groups fighting ... true racism should condemn Canseco for his
egotistical outburst. Baseball fans should display their
displeasure, perhaps by letting A's management know they don't
appreciate Canseco. Such expressions of concern might be
particularly appropriate coming from members of minorities who have
trouble scraping up the increasing price of admission to a
professional game.
   Racism? Hardly. With $2 million to invest and produce enough
income to keep him on easy street for the rest of his life, Canseco
never will experience some of the most difficult aspects of real
racism. That's a shame. It might make him more sensitive to the
plight of people who have real problems instead of imagined ones.

   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on baseball:
   It's going to be interesting to see whether professional
baseball collapses under its own greed or survives to maintain its
place as America's favorite game of summer.
   Fresh on the heels of the ... strike-lockout this spring comes
news that television viewers across the nation are going to be
short on chances to watch their favorite games this summer. ...
   (T)he Saturday Game of the Week, an American tradition as deep
as hot dogs and Cracker Jacks, is gone. It was murdered in the
crossfire of a corporate bidding shoot-out between NBC and CBS. The
winner, CBS, plans to give sports fans only 16 games this season _
and it might have been only eight if the public hadn't complained.
...
   How long can baseball survive with fans who can only see
occasional games on regular TV or cable TV, or have to shell out
lots of money for a satellite system, or have to find time for
long-distance travel to a game?
   Baseball has been a game of the common man _ a slow summer
respite from the busy American lifestyle. Its history is one of
being open to all; exclusivity has never been a factor.
   But greed seems to be leading baseball astray.

   The Journal Times, Racine, Wis., on the America's Cup:
   Perhaps it was appropriate that the final decision on the winner
of the America's Cup, the Super Bowl of sailing, was made in a
courtroom far removed from the sea.
   It epitomized the fact that the America's Cup has been made a
mockery as a premier sailing event and _ like so many other sports
_ has become primarily a legal exercise.
   For the record, the New York ... Court (of Appeals), sitting in
Albany, awarded the America's Cup to the San Diego Yacht Club, in
effect ruling that the catamaran used in the last races was not an
illegal craft.
   The appeal of the San Diego Yacht Club victory had been filed by
the loser, New Zealand's Mercury Bay Club.
   The race was sailed in September 1988 and the outcome has been
filling lawyers' pockets ever since.
   So San Diego has the cup and we can look forward to another
America's Cup race in 1992. Supposedly, possession of the Cup is
vital to a city because it means millions of dollars in revenue to
the host city during the races.
   But we can't help wondering if the legal skirmishes, and the
ruling which pretty well opens the race to virtually any kind of
vessel, haven't severely tarnished the cup.
   We won't be surprised if, when 1992 comes around, many sailing
enthusiasts simply shrug and say, as we are tempted to, ``who
cares?''

<LEADPARA>  Commissioner Fay Vincent told major league officials today that the present
salary structure is "out of hand" and the game must find a way to fairly share
revenues.;   In his annual report to the clubs at the winter meetings, Vincent
identified baseball's biggest challenges as future TV revenue, the problem of
player compensation and minority hiring.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BASEBALL SALARY STRUCTURE CALLED 'OUT OF HAND'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Because of local revenue disparity our clubs generate considerably
different amounts of revenue," Vincent said. "Our most prosperous club will
generate $100 million a year while at the other end of the spectrum a club
will generate less than $40 million.";   Seattle Mariners owner Jeff Smulyan
has put the club up for sale because he feels the team cannot generate enough
revenue to compete.;   "The small-market franchise has to compete on the
field, but its alternatives are limited," Vincent said. "Small-market clubs
simply have no choice but to arrange their payrolls on an entirely different
scale. Moving money from club to club is not the total answer.";   Pittsburgh,
another small market, already has lost free agent Bobby Bonilla to the New
York Mets and may have to trade Barry Bonds. The Mets gave Bonilla $29 million
for five years, and Bonds will seek at least $6 million per season.;   Vincent
blames salary arbitration for the sharp rise in salaries, which averaged
$851,492 in 1991 and probably will reach an average of $1 million in 1992.;  
"The result of arbitration is that it imposes large-market financial prices on
small market enterprises," Vincent said. "The trickle down effect as free
agent signings seep into the salary arbitration process is like facing Mantle
and Maris back-to-back: If one doesn't get you, the other one will.";  
Vincent said baseball must find a way to fairly share revenue. An economic
study committee currently is examining the situation.;   The money crunch may
get a little worse when current TV contracts with CBS and ESPN expire at the
end of the 1994 season.  </TEXT>
