<LEADPARA>  COMPOSER John Adams' "El Dorado" ("The Golden One") was unveiled in a
shimmering world premiere Wednesday night at the San Francisco Symphony, with
Adams conducting.;    This was, in effect, the Berkeley composer's Christopher
Columbus piece, coming just before the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival
in the New World. Instead of focusing on the controversial discoverer,
however, Adams explored the dream of finding a gilded paradise here,
implicitly contrasting that dream with the current ravaging of our planet, one
of Adams' stated concerns.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  REVIEW;  PERFORMANCE;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 11/16/91, pg. 2C); 
Because of an editor's error, a caption in Friday's eye was incorrect. It
should have stated that John Adams' 29-minute "El Dorado" received a standing
ovation from the San Francisco Symphony audience.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His 29-minute work got a standing ovation from many of the Davies Hall
patrons. It is so beautifully crafted in a style that is both familiar and
monumental that it likely will be performed and recorded often.;    Snobs may
scoff at Adams' tried-and-true writing. There's the familiar crescendoing
pulse in the opening movement ("Bolero," anyone?), and the closing movement
forays into Sibelius-tinged orchestration, New Age sounds, and the Steve Reich
style of phase-shift music begun a generation ago.;    But Adams, 44, remains
one of the champion colorists of the late 20th century. His minimalism for
maximum orchestra is awe- inspiring, and in "El Dorado" he creates gilded
pyramids of thoroughly consonant sound.;    While most symphonic composers are
still uncomfortable with electronic music, Adams is as much at ease with it as
with the full instrumental array on stage, which, for "El Dorado," included an
army of eight percussionists and heavy brass.;    His signal breakthrough in
this piece is the idiomatic integration of two synthesizers into the
orchestral texture. They spray their fine mist of exotic timbres and pitches
through the hall via 10 loudspeakers.;    Clearly Adams has broken through the
computer-phobia rampant at symphonies around the country, and it is high time.
Now any young symphonic composer who doesn't learn to use the synthesizer will
be ill prepared to create 21st-century music.;    The rest of the program
consisted of an Adams orchestration of a piece by Liszt, and two Stravinsky
works. I was far more impressed with Adams' version of Liszt's "The Black
Gondola" this week than in hearing it at the Cabrillo Music Festival three
months ago. The funereal piece shone Wednesday, illuminated by the expert
players and a more vibrant hall.;    The original Liszt composition was for
cello and piano. Adams' orchestration incorporates a lot of low instruments --
English horn, violas and bass clarinet -- and does so exquisitely. Toward the
end, it employs a celestial choir of cellos. This highly sophisticated,
pictorial piece contrasts markedly with some vacuous Liszt works heard all too
often. It was deliciously chromatic -- and moving, too.;    As a conductor,
Adams has his strong and weak points. "El Dorado" seemed by far the most
successful effort Wednesday. In the two Stravinsky pieces, he blunted the
accents and sapped much of their energy.;    In the prickly Stravinsky Violin
Concerto, however, soloist Stephanie Chase, formerly of the Bay Area, gave a
more exciting reading than I have ever heard. I'm baffled why Chase has not
soloed with more of our major orchestras. After melting the hall with the
soulful "Aria II," she gave a masterful version of the tricky finale.;    The
hall needed all the melting it could get. Apparently cool to contemporary
music this fall, patrons stayed away in droves, just as they did for the
"Pulcinella" program conducted by visiting Baltimore Symphony music director
David Zinman two weeks ago.;    The other Stravinsky work, the whimsical opera
excerpt "The Song of the Nightingale," opened the program. But this time the
nightingale was sedate, with no punch.;    The concert will be broadcast Nov.

<LEADPARA>  THE Cabrillo Music Festival is off and running again with what sounds like a
broken record: a new hall, expressive premieres, impressive symphonic music
and depressing acoustics.;    The festival's chancy firsts in soloists,
composer-in-residence, conductor and repertory came off resoundingly at the
prelude concert Thursday, though the new symphony hall is anything but
resounding.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Composer-conductor John Adams' docu-operas "Nixon in China" (1987) and "The
Death of Klinghoffer" (1991) rank as the most talked-about in decades. He
changed styles between them, from a synthesizer-led minimalism in the first to
a diaphanous, non-synthesized orchestration prevalent in the second. In both,
the vocal lyricism, the unambiguous tonality and the importance of understood
text were hallmarks.;    Thursday provided the U.S. premieres of two arias
from "Klinghoffer," featuring the title-role protagonist Sanford Sylvan
repeating his triumph. Baritone Sylvan soared with a voice that dripped
honeyed richness in nonpareil abundance; he sounds like this generation's
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but one with an unmistakable made-in-the-USA stamp,
once again signaling our American singers' coming of age.;    The pieces
offered a modern-day surrealism, whether in the soliloquy of the dying Leon
Klinghoffer during his slow-motion fall from the hijacked cruise ship, or the
strangely poetic "Bird Aria" of the Palestinian killer-terrorist Mamoud,
wistfully reflecting on the beauty of birds overhead.;    In both arias, Adams
laid out a spacious, comfortable vocal line for Sylvan's adagios with the
simplicity of a Purcell, committed to spotlighting the text's content rather
than any musical elaborations. Often the orchestra offered little more than
violin-dominated "halos" to encircle and embrace the voice, neatly rendered by
Adams himself on the podium. No hint of his earlier minimalism was evident.;  
 The conclusion is that Adams has again defied pigeonholing. He has entered
many styles with gusto, from chugging chordal repetition to modality to
near-Wagnerian romanticism to honky-tonk to a new post-minimalist
American-folk-like clarity. This versatility is a characteristic of a
tremendously inventive mind having many worlds yet left to conquer at the age
of 44, not all of them operatic.;    One non-operatic foray was his own
orchestration of Liszt's "La lugubre gondola" No. 2 ("The Black Gondola"),
which received its West Coast premiere Thursday. Writing late in life, Liszt
prophetically foresaw the death and funerary gondola trip of his son-in-law
Richard Wagner in Venice and wrote programmatic music to fit. Though there are
Wagnerian harmonies, and glints of themes recalling the chillingly haunting
Shepherd's Horn solo from "Tristan und Isolde," Liszt's treatment was almost
skeletal, whether in the piano version or in the alternate cello-piano version
played movingly beforehand by cellist Lee Duckles and pianist Emily
Wong-George.;    Adams transferred it, I think, too literally to orchestra,
with the string section taking most of the cello part, using almost no
harmonic filling out. The effect was too understated. Apart from Liszt
himself, no one short of Wagner should have carried out the orchestration. And
Wagner would have colored it so powerfully, so richly, that he'd have been
denounced as vehemently as Ted Turner is for his colorized movie classics.;   
The Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, looking like a near-clone of San Jose's, is a
Spartan half-century-old site better known for basketball than Beethoven and
Brahms. It lacks warmth on all fronts, but it offers capacity (900 seats for
this festival configuration), visibility and proximity. The most distant seat
sold is less than 80 feet from the podium, which is near center court on the
raised temporary stage.;    The auditorium sound for orchestra is pale and
distant. Future pressure will certainly come to amplify the orchestra as in
years past, despite all the (justified) kicking and screaming about sound
systems that have hardly proven state-of-the-art.;    The auditorium's big
plus is for chamber music, when the acoustic shell is drawn close to the
audience. The results then are downright gratifying, and no microphones need
to intrude.;    In addition, this 29th reprise of the fest born in Aptos is
offering pre-concert festivities out in the blocked-off street, with al fresco
dinners along with free local musical groups playing 75 minutes before curtain
time.;    There's even a booth selling numerous recordings made by Music
Director Dennis Russell Davies (who is on sabbatical), but so far none of the
many CDs of his internationally toasted 1991 fill-in, Adams.;    That should
change quickly if Adams' impressive opening concert is any guide.;    CABRILLO
NOTES -- Tickets remain for all festival concerts except for the two San Juan
Bautista "run-out" concerts Sunday. . . . Adams' "Klinghoffer" opera makes its
U.S. debut in Brooklyn this fall, coming to the San Francisco Opera in
November 1992. . . . Adams' Liszt orchestration is featured at the San
Francisco Symphony, along with his (as yet incomplete) world premiere "El
Dorado" Nov. 13-17, with the composer conducting. . . . The festival received
a $105,000 grant from the Daniel and Flora Hewlett Foundation, plus another
$35,000 in grants through the county Cultural Council for setting up the Civic
Auditorium with a suitable central stage and lighting grid. . . . Concert
patrons got a big scare Thursday with an auditorium-wide power failure toward
the end of intermission Thursday. Fortunately, power and music were both
restored soon after.; Cabrillo Music Festival; John Adams and JoAnn Falletta,
guest conductors; Where: Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, Center and Church
streets; When: Thursdays-Sundays through Aug. 4, plus weekend matinees. Also
this Sunday at San Juan Bautista (sold out). No repeat concerts.; Tickets:

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Sizzler in the concert hall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Driver reviews John Adams' new concerto conducted by Ken Nagano
The London Symphony Orchestra's concert under Kent Nagano at Barbican Hall
on Thursday was designed to be sizzling and balletic: Ravel's La Valse,
Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballet suite and the European premiere of the
Violin Concerto by the American John Adams (born 1947), a composer renowned
for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. Nagano is a leading exponent of
Adams's work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of
Klinghoffer and performed many of his other pieces.
He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall. His account of Ravel's
bewitching yet brutally vivid 'choreographic poem', that strangely extrovert
threnody for the old Europe, which begins in the ballroom to end on the
battlefield, made one feel the truth of all those epithets and brought home
the sheer sonorous power of the LSO, especially in the lower and darkly
rumbling registers. No matter how dark and rumbling the sounds, they were
always precisely focussed: little curling counterpoints took on chilling
force.
Adams's concerto, written in 1993 and premiered in Minneapolis in January
(with soloist Jorja Fleezanis) is also a kind of choreographic poem, having
been jointly commissioned not only by two orchestras (Minnesota Orchestra;
LSO) but by the New York City Ballet. Adams's strict, often motoric rhythmic
manner and colourful (but often inwardly complex) imagery lend themselves
readily to dance.
His 1988 score Fearful Symmetries has been choreographed no less than six
times, most recently by Ashley Page, whose Royal Ballet version opened at
Covent Garden last week.
But it was out of the experience of opera composing, Adams writes, that the
present concerto sprang. To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic
flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of
his earlier work but called for by The Death of Klinghoffer and now the
basis of what he calls a 'post-Klinghoffer', or post-minimalist, language.
Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have
tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking
the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if
the part-writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the
rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes.
The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of
percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds. When the latter are
not spending time perversely imitating the harp, they contribute some novel,
ethereal effects. There are the three movements, fast-slow-fast, traditional
to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the
curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an
exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell.
The solo part, brilliantly despatched by Gidon Kremer, is full of
traditional figurations and devices. With likeable impunity and verve, Adams
has produced a virtuoso vehicle in something like the grand romantic manner.

<MEMO>  PERFORMANCE  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Earlier this month the low-key, local-boy-turned-star Adams was back home
briefly between conducting the Cleveland Orchestra and recording his opera
with the Opera de Lyon in France. It's that kind of life now: commissions,
major engagements, jet commutes, 15-hour days.;    At 44, Adams still manages
the aw-shucks, pebble-kicking quality that has endeared him to the Bay Area
musical community since joining the San Francisco Conservatory of Music
faculty in 1972.;    Music macabre;  Now it's Cabrillo's turn. In the biggest
coup since engaging Music Director Dennis Russell Davies, the Cabrillo Music
Festival in Santa Cruz has Adams on the podium for two weeks during Davies'
sabbatical year.;    The kind of audacity marking Adams' guest-conducting
programs around the country is being carried over to Cabrillo. Few
composer-conductors have the panache to open their festival with such morbid
morsels as their own "Aria of the Falling Body," and close with Mahler's
"Songs on the Death of Children" and Britten's "Sinfonia da requiem," after
several equally lugubrious selections.;    The edge of the new;  While Mozart,
Mahler and Britten all get attention, the Cabrillo focus is on newer music, in
which the composer-conductor offers special insights, Adams points out.;   
"It's helpful on both sides. My composing informs my conducting. When doing
music of other composers, I have a different intuition.;    "Also my
conducting informs my composing -- I'm aware of necessities, of what
instruments can and cannot do, and what can be done in limited rehearsal
time.";    The 1991 Cabrillo sojourn getting into full swing tonight could be
termed a season of mystical horizons. It offers Britten's songs on William
Blake, Adams' stunning vocal concert piece "The Wound-Dresser," his own
orchestration of Liszt's "The Black Gondola" (a preview of his
premiere-studded San Francisco Symphony program in the fall), part of
Britten's "Kingdom of the Pagodas," and Milhaud's "The Creation of the World"
(danced by Tandy Beal &amp; Co.).;    Overriding it all is the shadow of Adams'
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer," a work based on the Palestinian hijacking
of the "Achille Lauro" cruise ship in the Mediterranean in 1985. The work will
not reach the San Francisco Opera until November 1992, but Cabrillo scheduled
excerpts and offers performances by its title-role singer, baritone Sanford
Sylvan.;    Because of the opera, a Middle Eastern theme overlays the concerts
the second weekend, with Nazim Ozel on Turkish flute and "semi-civilized tree"
(a custom-made, plucked musical instrument) Aug. 3, and a collaboration by
Group Parvaneh and Ballet Afsaneh with Turkish and Persian music and dance
Aug. 4.;    Modern melodies;  But nothing is a one-man show, not even with
Adams around. Music Director Davies collaborated via long distance in the
programming decisions. JoAnn Falletta leads the juried concert of music by
living California composers Saturday afternoon, with pieces by Ross Bauer,
David Jaffe, Stefan Carow, Allen Shearer and "the other" John Adams, John
Luther Adams.;    This Cabrillo season features prominent soloists such as
violinist Stephanie Chase and pianist Richard Goode, and finally what may be
an end to the nomadic Cabrillo life: an entry into the Santa Cruz Civic
Auditorium, thanks to a $35,000 renovation. The face-lift instantly converts
the 1,950-seat hall into a 970-seat concert site with new lighting, sound
system, grid and proscenium. All the concerts (except Aug. 28) are being held
at the auditorium.;     Cabrillo Music Festival; John Adams and JoAnn
Falletta, guest conductors; Where: Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; When: Nightly
Thursdays-Sundays through Aug. 4, with weekend matinees. Also this Sunday at

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: American symphonists - Andrew Porter reviews much
noisy, angry, well meaning music and has to cover his ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to a recent survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League,
covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, John Adams (the
composer of the operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the
living American composer most often played. Kurt Masur began his
directorship of the New York Philharmonic with Adams's Short Ride in a Fast
Machine and Tromba Lontana, two short works, one loud and one soft. El
Dorado, Adams's latest orchestra piece, was given its premiere recently by
the San Francisco Symphony, which commissioned it. It's about 'the greed of
the eighties', we are told, with a first movement, angry and violent, that
is 'my own response to the Gulf War'.
I've not heard El Dorado, but last month in New York there were two
symphonies containing much angry, noisy music. John Corigliano's First
Symphony was inspired by the sight of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, those
thousands of commemorative panels for those who have died. Each movement
recalls a lost musician friend. The first, 'Of Rage and Remembrance', begins
'ferociously' and includes pages on end of slashing chords marked 'tutti as
loud as possible', but in a quiet episode a distant piano is heard playing
the Albeniz Tango, a favourite piece of the pianist friend remembered.
The central movement, a Tarantella, recalls a friend in the music business,
famed for his wit, who became mad; a trivial tarantella tune is put through
increasingly horrible distortions. Corigliano found the motto theme of the
finale, 'Giulio's Song', while listening to 30-year-old tapes of himself and
a cellist friend improvising. Played by a solo cello, it begins with the
whole-tone ascent that in Berg's Violin Concerto spells 'Es ist genug'.
Other themes join it; in the score they are named, and the names are those
of musician friends who have died. The music mounts to a battering funeral
march, with the clash and clamour of bells; in a quiet coda earlier themes
are recalled.
The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony, which gave the first
performance, under Barenboim. It was recorded (Erato); the disc has stayed
for months in Billboard's Classical Top Ten; Corigliano won the Grawemeyer
Award, music's 'Nobel Prize'. (Birtwistle, for The Mask of Orpheus; Ligeti,
for the piano Preludes; and Chinary Ung, for Spiral, were earlier winners.)
At the New York premiere, which was given by the Philharmonic under Leonard
Slatkin, panels of the Quilt hung in the lobby of Fisher Hall, and the
audience was invited to inscribe the names of dead loved ones on a new
panel. The emotional charge was high. The critic must steel his heart to say
that, for all the pain and grief and love that it expresses, the musical
means of expression are undistinguished, conventional, obvious. The New York
Times went so far as to call the result 'vulgar'.
Aaron Jay Kernis's Second Symphony, which was given its first performance by
the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, addresses even more 'the endless
violence of the Gulf War, the subtle and unsubtle encroachment upon women's
and minority rights, the hovering threat of censorship of artists along with
the economic, social, and medical disasters that plague us daily'. Adams is
45, Corigliano is 54; Kernis is a younger composer, born in 1960, who has
become very prominent. He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in
his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (1983), for soprano and orchestra; Love
Scenes (1987), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello. But now, as work after
work after work pours out, he seems content to press the conventional
response triggers.
His first symphony, Symphony in Waves, had its premiere earlier this season
from the New York Chamber Symphony, and has been recorded. It included
Adams-like passages of minimalism. The movements of the Second Symphony are
entitled 'Alarm' 'Air/Ground', and 'Barricade'. The first, marked
'aggressively', contains wave upon wave of noisy climax underpinned by
ostinato. In the second, simple melodies wander over 'grounded' harmonies.
While writing the third, Kernis says, 'a recurring image was the building
full of innocent Iraqi civilians under siege which was mistakenly bombed and
obliterated nearly a year ago'; it ends with the loudest noise I have ever
heard in a concert hall - four tam-tams whacked 'at maximum volume' for five
long seconds. Audience and orchestra players covered their ears.
Crash-bang - alternating (but not always) with episodes soft, sentimental,
and soupy - has become the mode of the successful American orchestra works
taken up in city after city. Del Tredici's Alice screams at the top of her
voice; he himself describes his Steps, composed for the Philharmonic, as
'violent and raucous . . . clattering . . . Godzilla battling Megalon'. This
is music for people already half-deafened, responsive only to high-decibel
assault. And he is not the only composer who writes it.
Poster-art is in vogue. American orchestras (and their conductors) -
shunning Carter, Sessions, Wuorinen - embrace it. When not strident, it's
'nostalgic'. In the programme that brought the Kernis, there was a 'new'
Flute Concerto, by Joseph Turrin, in sub-Prokofiev vein. In the Philharmonic
programme after the one that brought the Corigliano, Slatkin championed
Claude Baker's Shadows, a 'Japanese' piece such as many composers have
written: a flower arrangement of exquisite sounds - scratch, patter, tinkle
and ting - based on four haiku but also (with full acknowledgement and
near-quotation) on movements by Mahler, Britten, and Stravinsky. Dainty
working, no harm it in at all - and no sustenance. We might as well have
been listening to Takemitsu.

<TEXT>     "That is why we want to give the Verdi 'Requiem' then -- it's the place for
a big sound," explained Music Director Herbert Blomstedt yesterday from his
home in Lucerne, Switzerland.;    Recording postponed;    The annual May
recordings with London Records will have to be postponed until fall 1992. And
for one week in May the orchestra will be silent, right after its three-week
Asian tour.;    Blomstedt will be on the podium for 15 instead of the usual 16
weeks because of that May week without programs. Three of his weeks on the
podium will be during the Asian tour.;    The ambitious program, Blomstedt
says, serves his goal "to give everybody a new and fresh experience" in the
concert hall.;    Some highlights:;    (box) The season opens with a gala
Sept. 4 at Davies, with coloratura soprano Kathleen Battle singing Richard
Strauss and works by Mozart and Berlioz.;    (box) Guest conductor David
Zinman, who is looking more and more like a fixture here, will return for two
weeks. Other guest conductors include Roger Norrington, Eduardo Mata, Christof
Perick, composer John Adams, Iona Brown, Michael Tilson Thomas, Kent Nagano,
John Nelson, Neal Stulberg and Silvain Cambreling. Conducting during two weeks
of subscription concerts, each, are Semyon Bychkov, Gunther Herbig and
Alasdair Neale.;    (box) Bay Area audiences will hear the large-scale Charles
Ives Symphony No. 4. This American answer to Mahler's symphonies, which dates
back to the World War I era, will be given under Michael Tilson Thomas, Nov.
20-23, with the symphony chorus.;    (box) John Adams' podium week Nov. 13-16
will feature the commissioned world premiere of his own "El Dorado.";    (box)
Other commissioned world premieres include New York composer Charles
Wuorinen's 35-minute-long "Genesis" on Christian texts, written for chorus and
orchestra, and San Francisco composer Wayne Peterson's "The Face of Night, the
Heart of the Dark.";    (box) Other music by living composers includes various
pieces by Henri Dutilleux, Christopher Rouse's "Iscariot," Alfred Schnittke's
"(K)ein Sommernachtstraum," Joan Tower's "Sequoia," George Perle's "Dance
Fantasy" and excerpts from Sir Michael Tippett's "The Midsummer Marriage.";   
(box) Other unusual repertoire features a program consisting entirely of
Manuel de Falla's music, with "Homenajes" and the opera "La Vida Breve";
Stravinsky's complete "Pulcinella," with voices; Honegger's "Christmas
Cantata"; Barber's Cello Concerto; Corigliano's Symphony No. 1; and Francaix's
"The Flower Clock.";    (box) The recording repertory next season with London
Records is not all traditional either, with Schubert's "Great C Major"
Symphony (No. 9), Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll," Franz Berwald's "Symphonie
Serieuse," Schubert's Overture in the Italian Style, and Strauss' tone poem
"Ein Heldenleben" on the agenda.;    (box) Performances of Berlioz'
vocal-dramatic symphony "Romeo et Juliette," under Roger Norrington.;    (box)
Star soloists include pianists Mitsuko Uchida, Horacio Gutierrez, Garrick
Ohlsson, Peter Serkin and Andre Watts; violinist Cho-Liang Lin; and sopranos

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The concert was a beauty, despite being upset by the abrupt departure of
its Franco-Romanian concertmaster, Romuald Tecco, to France for his mother's
funeral.;    'Klinghoffer' aria substituted; Instead of the Shostakovich
violin concerto he was to have played, John Adams, guest music director for
the 1991 season, substituted "The Bird Aria" from his own opera, "The Death of
Klinghoffer." (It is scheduled for San Francisco Opera's 1992 season.);    The
aria is sung by the Palestinian Mamoud as he watches the birds from the deck
of the doomed ship Achille Lauro: "Messengers of God . . . angels free to
marry and die," he calls them (in Alice Goodman's lovely text).;    Its winged
imagery was complemented by "The Black Gondola," a barcarolle for piano (1882)
by Franz Liszt, transcribed by Adams in the dark colors of French and English
horns and massed cellos.;    Civil War horrors;  The second half grew even
darker with "The Wound-Dresser," a tableau for baritone and orchestra by
Adams, to a text by Walt Whitman. This prose-poem, based on Whitman's
experiences as a medical orderly during the Civil War, describes the horrors
of war's aftermath in unflinching terms. Whitman faced gangrene and amputated
limbs, infected wounds and unstoppable bleeding as bravely as any more
celebrated war hero, and his compassion for the dying soldiers makes the poem
bearable.;    It's not a likely subject for the concert hall, but Adams has
made it into a powerful piece of musical painting. It was written for Sanford
Sylvan, an American baritone with an exceptionally resonant and lustrous
voice. (He also sang the "Klinghoffer" excerpt.) He's so compelling that even
depressing sentiments became things of beauty in his voice. He sings again at
8 p.m. Saturday: a cycle of songs by Benjamin Britten, to poems of William
Blake.;    Adams filled out the program with Haydn (Symphony No. 83, subtitled
"La Poule" or "The Hen" because of an oboe tune that supposedly sounds like
clucking) and Mozart (Symphony No. 39). These were performed with zest and
even brilliance, despite a few orchestral slips. The Mozart got a big,
generous performance, making one appreciate Adams' gifts as a legit (as
opposed to a strictly new music) conductor.;    Amplified gospel suffers; 
With its thick adobe walls and plain box shape, the mission is kind to
classical music. The Cabrillo orchestra sounds like the Vienna Philharmonic
here, yet preserves the agility of a chamber ensemble.;    The Elements of
Praise, a contemporary gospel choir from Oakland, were not so fortunate. These
lively acoustics took their amplified arrangements, chewed them up and spit
them out as gibberish. However, the evangelical arm-twisting that connected
their songs came through loud and clear and offensive.;    The festival moves
back to Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium for its second weekend of performances.;

<TEXT>
In the 1970s George Crumb was the most performed of contemporary American
composers, a success founded on his knack of offering all the exotic
textural trappings of the avant garde within a friendly sugar-coated shell.
Twenty years on it is John Adams who occupies a similar position of eminence
in the US. Adams's confections may be sugar-free yet they have their own
surface allure, even if in keeping with the spirit of the 1990s it is a far
more astringent one.
On Monday Adams himself conducted the London Sinfonietta in a programme of
contemporary American works, three of them UK premieres, which ended with
Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children. The song cycle was beautifully delivered
by the mezzosoprano Christine Whittlesey and treble Sam Pay, yet sounds now
a museum piece, the thin musical substance sustained only by its web of
cultural references and the undimmed beauty of the Lorca text.
There just might be more magic left in the sounds than was obvious here, for
Adams conducts rather as he composes, with bold poster colours and bracing
rhythmic energy which leave precious little room for subtlety or magic.
Certainly Peter Lieberson's nimble Raising the Gaze would have benefitted
from more air and awareness of light and shade than Adams and the
Sinfonietta instrumentalists suggested, while Tod Machover's Song of Penance
seemed over-insistently eloquent.
Machover's was, though, an intriguing construction, with a solo
computer-linked 'hyperviola' (played by Paul Silverstone) set against dense
textures which combined live and pre-recorded instruments and voices. A
specially commissioned poem serves as thematic backbone; it appears in both
spoken and sung form throughout the work, usually embedded deep in the
textures, while the hyperviola alternates keening chromaticism with ripe
romantic harmonies. The mixture is beguiling and repellent by turns like
latter day Skryabin; the sheer density of the sound world is seductive in
itself.
There was some new Adams too, a Chamber Symphony completed last year which
was receiving its first British performance. The Schoenbergian echoes of the
title belie the musical substance. There are three movements with
calculatedly memorable titles  - 'Mongrel Airs', 'Aria with Walking Bass',
'Roadrunner'  - and plenty of spiky stylistic allusions along the way.
The first movement jumbles Soldier's Tale Stravinsky with Threepenny Opera
Weill, the second unfolds an increasing elaborate skein of lyrical lines
over a constantly mobile bass, while the finale is an extrovert romp, highly
virtuosic (brilliantly played by the Sinfonietta) and propelled by a
rock-like rhythmic pulse. It is artfully put together, undeniably attractive
and ultimately, I suspect, totally specious.

<LEADPARA>  CANDIDATES for San Jose Symphony's music directorship are being aggressively
courted by rival organizations, just as though they were the most eligible
bachelors at the prom.;    Leonid Grin, the Soviet emigre who scored such a
vibrant success with critics and audiences when he was guest conductor in
February, looked like the front-runner for a similar vacancy at the Spokane,
Wash., Symphony. Spokane reps even traveled to hear him in San Jose, and Grin
went to Spokane to conduct some audition rehearsals.;    But now, amid great
sighs of relief by local symphony-watchers, Spokane has named another Soviet
emigre -- Vakhtang Jordania -- as its music director. So Grin remains in the
running for San Jose -- at least until the next offer pops up on his fax
machine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     San Jose already has lost candidate John Mauceri, another preseason
favorite, at least in this critic's view, until his cancellation and
withdrawal last month.;    BERKELEY MINIMALIST composer John Adams' upcoming
opera may be too political for its own good. Even with the Persian Gulf war
now over, the work is being treated with extreme caution and special security
measures.;    "The Death of Klinghoffer" is based on the 1985 Palestinian
terrorist attack on the Mediterranean cruise ship Achille Lauro, which
resulted in the death of one passenger, an escape by air, an interception by
U.S. jets, and a trial in Italy in which the terrorists were found guilty.;   
The opus may prove as politically sensitive as classics of the genre such as
"The Marriage of Figaro," "Rigoletto" and "Un ballo in maschera.";    Next
week's world premiere in Brussels, Belgium, of this operatic collaboration
between composer Adams and stage director Peter Sellars is being orchestrated
with a news brownout. There are no interviews, and, until two weeks before the
March 19 opening, there were no press releases, either.;    The work, coming
to the San Francisco Opera in the fall of 1992, opens in the Monnaie Opera
House with Adams in attendance.;    The unsettled world situation is also a
factor in the cancellation of upcoming tours to Western Europe by the New York
Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard
Slatkin. The Philharmonic was to make an Easter tour, while the St. Louis
orchestra was to have gone in February.;    THE COMPUTER-MUSIC studio at
Stanford University has aroused controversy over a concert coming Thursday
night to Dinkelspiel Auditorium, because Norwegian composer Per Landa insists
on passing out earplugs for those who will be hearing his high-volume music.; 
  "That (high a sound level) is utterly against my philosophy, but I can't be
tyrannical," says studio director John Chowning. The concert also features
composers from Argentina and Stanford.;    On a more harmonious note, Chowning
is working to bring over from the USSR the legendary Leon Theremin, who
invented one of the first electronic instruments (named the theremin) around
1924. Chowning met him on his recent Soviet visit and found him spry and
active at 95, eager to return to the United States, where he had lived for a
time until 1938. Theremin once met with Lenin himself to demonstrate his
instrument and apparently left the Red leader impressed with his revolutionary
device.;    THE DEATH of New York composer Elie Siegmeister at 82 deprives the
music world of a live-wire author, raconteur, educator, and prolific composer
on American themes. He studied abroad with Nadia Boulanger and had his music
played by Arturo Toscanini, who was never known to be a champion of American
music. Five seasons ago the San Jose Symphony, under George Cleve, played
Siegmeister's "Ozark Set."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE 29th annual Cabrillo Music Festival finally engaged Santa Cruz's own Tandy
Beal &amp; Company to present a program Saturday afternoon. Banding with Beal
produced a world premiere choreography, as well as that marvelous
Genesis-in-rewind-mode dance called "La creation du monde" (The Creation of
the Earth).;    The pairing was a congenial one, echoed by a ballet-inspired
orchestral program given Friday night, also under John Adams' baton.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TANDY BEAL'S CHOREOGRAPHY BRINGS QUIRKINESS
TO CABRILLO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Concert Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Dancer-choreographer Beal is bursting in quirky moves and instant
Chaplin-like humor, mixing mimic fun with sight-gag theater, using the arms
more than legs for the center of attention.;    In her new piece "Sequenza V,"
named after Berio's solo-trombone avant-garde composition, she turned musician
Daniel Livesay into an actor, and surrounded him with masked figures hidden in
Picasso-like cubisms -- cone shapes, zany paste-on eyes and "wrong-place"
facial features.;    She feeds the creative furnaces by putting musical notes
into a giant music machine, and ends it all with an action-painting sequence
leaving the scene as wildly color-splotched as the music itself. I think
Luciano Berio would enjoy Beal's responsiveness to his music and like the
novelty of those paste-on noses, mouths and ears.;    An imaginative Beal; 
We've already had do-it-yourself. It took Beal to dream up glue-it-yourself.; 
  Beal tore up the original scenario for "La creation du monde," the
pioneering 1923 dance score by composer Darius Milhaud. Her view now has the
Creation in reverse -- an idea very appealing philosophically to us troubled
modern urban-dwellers. The couples dancing in ballrooms undergo a transition
of decay and disruption. Plant life runs amok, supplants the architecture, and
creates an Eden with the dancers becoming restored Adams and Eves. The piece
is a marvelous reflection on our civilization, further allowing set designer
Kevin Constant to produce verdant vines as if out of a Rousseau primitive
painting.;    Beal's six dancers stood aside for her rapid-fire solo
"Mysterious Barricades," a funny invention of limbs turning into mirrors, of
twitches, of snaky undulations, and of hands that grab where they shouldn't,
all at such a wild pace that it's almost over before it starts.;    Live music
was used throughout -- a welcome luxury for Beal, allowing Adams' festival
orchestra to shine in the Milhaud piece. William Trimble's alto sax solo
Saturday was delicious.;    Milhaud always insisted this was the first jazz
used in serious concert music. Its recurrent oboe solo also apparently
inspired a major theme of George Gershwin's "Three Preludes" (1926) for solo
piano.;    "I don't really like new music," composer-conductor John Adams
insists publicly. He made an exception for Friday night when he programmed
"Eros Piano" (1989) by -- surprise! -- John Adams himself. The orchestral part
is almost non-existent. The piano part Friday night was turned over to Adams'
longtime friend Mack McCray, who recreated this tribute to that new-age
classicist among composers, the late Morton Feldman.;    This is a nostalgic
mood piece, conjuring up visions of late-night clouds of cigarette smoke, as
wispy as the limpid jazz harmonies clinging around the keyboard during this
14-minute U.S. premiere.;    Adams' concert programming was effective. Two
ballet scores complemented each other with their sonic zing and percussive
sparkle. Adams unearthed a long swatch of act-two music from Benjamin
Britten's exotic fairy tale "The Prince of Pagodas" (1957). Most of it follows
the soft-focus Holst-Delius strain common in English music. But one magical
number has the most astute orchestral-percussion simulation of the highly
volatile Balinese gamelan (traditional percussion orchestra) that you'll ever
hear.;    Britten's effect;  The short gamelan section rings with the "beats"
of nearly attuned pairings, with the serene tootling of high flute, and with
the highly agitated explosions of metallic sounds. This was all a result of a
single 1956 Balinese visit by the brilliantly adventurous Britten, who
assimilated one of the richest and most complex musical traditions in that
brief exposure.;    His uneven story ballet -- all about a Cinderella in an
Eastern land of magic -- offers several instrumental solos, and a bracing
musical "collision" of orchestra with off-stage trumpets doing their own
thing.;    Stravinsky's revolutionary 1911 ballet score "Petrouchka" was an
apt companion piece, even with Conductor Adams whittling down its exclamation
points and irreverent outbursts in his interpretation.;    Once again the
orchestra under Adams showed indifferent polish and accuracy. But these two
opuses offered some colossal solo work by principal players like William
Winant (percussion), Adam Gordon (trumpet), Emily Wong-George (piano) and the
remarkable concertmaster Elizabeth Baker. Baker was subbing superbly on
emergency basis for Romuald Tecco, who had a death in the family.  </TEXT>

   Santa Cruz, Calif. -- The most dramatic way to approach
Santa Cruz is by driving west, entering the coastal region
through Gilroy, the garlic capital of the world. The aroma of
a dozen Little Italys penetrates a car's closed windows. The
radio suddenly seems overrun by new-age music stations and
earnest '60s-style Berkeley radicals. When the ocean appears,
its spectacular beauty takes your breath away.
   It's a particularly appropriate route to take if you
happen to be headed for the Cabrillo Music Festival, where
pre-concert pastries include such local specialties as
garlic-bread pudding, where a Saturday-night concert can pair
a fine performance of a Benjamin Britten song cycle with the
work of a tedious new-age Turk, and where a pervasive '60s
informality can be both endearing and infuriating.

   The Cabrillo festival was begun 29 years ago by the dean
of California composers, the wonderfully lyric and
unpredictably multicultural Lou Harrison, as a quirky
chamber-music series in a coffee-house hangout for Cabrillo
College students in nearby Aptos. It grew quickly, moving to
the college itself and later to a convivial circus tent on a
thrilling site at the Santa Cruz campus of the University of
California, overlooking the sparkling bay.
   In 1974, it hired an up-and-coming young conductor, Dennis
Russell Davies, then music director of the St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra. Mr. Davies put together a first-rate small
orchestra, invited world-class composers each year,
commissioned and premiered important work and created
arresting programs. One year, for instance, he featured works
in every concert by Ravel, the American eclecticist William
Bolcom and the eccentric Estonian minimalist Arvo Part.
   Meanwhile, however, the festival has fallen on leaner
times. For the first time in 17 years, Mr. Davies -- who is
now music director of the city of Bonn, as well as of the
Brooklyn Philharmonic and the American Composers Orchestra --
took a sabbatical, leaving his future involvement with the
festival uncertain.
   The festival itself has the same economic troubles every
small-scale arts organization has these days, and it has
hired new management to address the situation. No longer able
to afford its sensational site, it has moved to the unwieldy
and acoustically unflattering Civic Auditorium in depressing
downtown Santa Cruz.
   But the festival's spirit survives, and it continues to
offer two of the most thoughtful and original summer musical
weekends anywhere in America.
   Actually, this year's festival looked, on paper,
considerably more conventional than it generally does when
Mr. Davies programs it. But, thanks to a brilliant stroke, it
wasn't. By inviting the composer John Adams as guest
director, Cabrillo ensured that however common the
repertoire, it would be filtered through the sensibility of a
controversial composer who is also proving to be an
interesting conductor. He is best known for his operas "Nixon
in China" and the new "The Death of Klinghoffer," which
reaches the U.S. next month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Often cast as a minimalist, Mr. Adams employs minimalist
repetition as only one facet of his multistylistic approach,
which can include everything from American swing to
Schoenbergian dissonance. At Cabrillo, he showed himself to
be simply uncategorizable.
   He began the festival's second and more elaborate weekend,
the one I attended, with the American premiere of his "Eros
Piano," a moving short elegiac score for piano and chamber
orchestra that sounds a little bit like the '50s jazz of Bill
Evans meeting the mystical sweetness of Olivier Messiaen. He
followed that with the ravishing second act of Britten's
seldom-played ballet, "The Prince of the Pagodas," with its
glamorous orchestral imitation of Balinese gamelan. He wound
up the program with a performance of Stravinsky's
"Petroushka" that emphasized the music's rhythmic bite and
brash orchestral colors, unlike most glossy modern orchestral
accounts.
   It was a canny Cabrillo evening. Mr. Adams bowed toward
the multicultural impulses that have always characterized the
festival -- much of Mr. Harrison's music is inspired by the
gamelan. He offered a fresh look at Britten, a composer who,
like Mr. Adams, spent his career coming to his own individual
terms with modernism. And he presented some insight into his
own striking musical personality, which vacillates from the
gloomy to the glitzy in fascinating ways.
   Occasionally Mr. Adams's instincts went awry, however, as
they did in a big way on his weirdly devised Saturday-night
program. The first half consisted of a terrific performance
of Britten's stern, seldom-heard "Songs and Proverbs of
William Blake," sung with a riveting sensitivity to every
word by the baritone Sanford Sylvan and accompanied with
wondrous fluidity by the pianist Richard Goode. But it was
followed by nearly an hour's worth of needless noodling from
the Turkish-born Nazim Ozel, who plucks away on all 400
strings he has strung on a branch of a California live oak he
calls the "Semi-Civilized Tree."
   Earlier that day there was a delightfully noncondescending
family concert featuring the witty Tandy Beal &amp; Co., the
local choreographer collaborating with Mr. Adams for a
mysterious and mildly risque version of Milhaud's "La
Creation du Monde." The next evening was mixed: Mr. Adams led
a driving, properly disturbing account of Britten's "Sinfonia
da Requiem"; Mr. Sylvan and Mr. Adams became emotionally
overwrought in Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder"; Mr. Goode
offered one of his typically nuanced renditions of Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 25, with Mr. Adams accompanying solidly.
   Missing, for the first time in memory, was anything by Mr.
Harrison, who still reigns as the informal paterfamilias of
the festival. But a CD of Mr. Harrison's gorgeous Third
Symphony, performed by Mr. Davies and the Cabrillo Music
Festival Orchestra, was just released on Music Masters. No
one else today writes orchestral music as rapturous as this,
or combines musical cultures as effectively. And no place is
better for producing such music as Cabrillo.

<LEADPARA>  SOPRANO Elizabeth Knighton Printy barely escaped disaster in the scary suicide
scene at the end of a Minnesota Opera production of "Tosca.";   When she
jumped through the window for Tosca's suicide plunge, she missed the bed that
was supposed to catch her, hit her head, and fell off a platform to the floor
22 feet below.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Undaunted, she expects to perform a stint with the San Jose Symphony next
spring.;   "It was a miracle that I didn't kill myself," she said. The fall
resulted in four broken ribs, a concussion, a broken pelvis and a week in the
hospital.;   After that Oct. 24 mishap at St. Paul's Ordway Theater, the
anguished epilogue to her otherwise successful debut as Tosca, she is on
crutches but glad there was "no irreparable damage.";   The determined singer
plans to resume her performance schedule in January, singing the songs of
death in Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14 in New York City.;   Now a resident of
Minneapolis, Knighton Printy lived in the Bay Area from 1976 to '84. She sang
in the Verdi "Requiem" with the San Jose Symphony last spring and will return
for the Mahler Second Symphony, under George Cleve, in June 1992.;  
Appropriately, the Mahler symphony is subtitled "Resurrection.";   In other
news of the orchestra, the lineup of vocalists for the Dec. 7-8
"Messiah"-Mozart Requiem package is superlative: Lorraine Hunt, Wendy
Hillhouse, Robert Tate and William Parker.;   The symphony has also signed
Mexican-born conductor Jorge Perez-Gomez for the May 14 flamenco program at
Flint Center. Guitarist Anita Sheer will give the Bay Area premiere of the
"Suite flamenca" by her teacher, Carlos Montoya. She describes it as a
concerto for guitar and orchestra. Choreographer Patri Nader will prepare the
local performers of Bailes de Espana in four selections featuring composers
Bizet, Albeniz, de Falla and Gimenez.;   UNITED OPERA -- The San Francisco
Opera wants to do something special for the weeklong celebration in June 1995
of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations charter. A new opera, perhaps.
The company's general director, Lotfi Mansouri, explained: "We hope we can
stimulate a new opera from Pacific Rim countries" with a commission.;   NEW
FACES -- The San Francisco Symphony has announced an adventurous appointment:
Precocious British composer George Benjamin, 31, will lead Wet Ink, a
new-music series featuring six U.S. premieres, from Feb. 7 to Feb. 28. The
series will replace the New and Unusual Music series, which was led by
composer-in-residence George Perle, 76.;   The symphony may also be
cultivating a special relationship with frequent guest conductor David Zinman.
After prolonged stints this year and last, Zinman is scheduled to return again
June 18-27 to lead an entire Beethoven festival. The orchestra could name
Zinman principal guest conductor, which would make him a prime candidate to
succeed Herbert Blomstedt, music director since 1985, should Blomstedt decide
to move on. Zinman is music director of the Baltimore Symphony.;   MUSICAL
NOTES -- KUSP-FM radio (88.9) in Santa Cruz got a leg up on the competition by
acquiring the exclusive U.S. premiere broadcast rights for John Adams' new
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer." A recording of the world premiere in
Brussels last March will be broadcast Sunday at 10 a.m. . . .;   Also at Santa
Cruz, the University of California, Santa Cruz's McHenry Library is holding a
free public reception at 3 p.m. Friday to mark the acquisition of the archives
of local composer-conductor George Barati, 78. At the event, held in the
Special Collections area, the Porter String Quartet will give the world
premiere of Barati's String Quartet No. 3.;   Artistic director and composer
Robert Greenberg of Composers Inc. in San Francisco complied fully with a
request from his publicity-minded board of directors. "They said, 'We need a
South Bay angle,' " Greenberg explains. He wrote a new work for violin and
piano called -- "South Bay Angle.";   James Mobberley, featured at last
month's Composers Inc. concert, explained how he became a composer. Camping
out in Bodega Bay years ago, he found he couldn't sleep. "There were two
foghorns. I noticed that they were blowing a minor ninth (interval) apart, (in
a regular pattern of) 12 beats against 17.;   "I decided then that I had to
become a composer."  </TEXT>

COMPOSER GETS 1 SHOT TO WIN OVER LISTENERS

<P>
Composer Charles Wuorinen is confident that avant-garde music only needs 
adequate exposure to win over reluctant listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of acceptance depends on familiarity," he said. "After all, Bach 
and Beethoven wrote demanding music, but because it is played by devoted 
performers and taught in schools that value the music, ultimately, the complex 
and demanding becomes familiar. Their music is loved, even if it may not be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen has but a single opportunity, however, to make his case to the San 
Diego Symphony audience Thursday evening at UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Auditorium. In the inaugural concert of the symphony's Pulitzer Series, the 
51-year-old New York composer will conduct a pair of his recent works as well 
as two Stravinsky compositions. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of cultivating an adoring and understanding public, Wuorinen, 
who is often described as a second-generation 12-tone composer, has made 
"complex and demanding" his musical credo. Despite a prolific output -- about 
160 works in almost every musical medium -- he has never attracted the 
attention of such minimalist media darlings as Philip Glass and John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who write real music do not do it for the immediate satisfaction, 
but in the hope that it will last. That which is wildly popular will not last 
-- the more popular they are, the shorter their works will be around," Wuorinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he wishes to be known as a minimalist basher. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the issue," he said. "My problem is this: A lot of music 
that is essentially pop music is now being declared to be serious music and 
played on programs with Beethoven, Mozart and yours truly. Entertainment is 
healthy in its place, but I object to confusing it with the higher arts." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Wuorinen's non-stop flow of awards and prizes, starting at 
age 16 with the New York Philharmonic Young Composers Award, has forged such 
unwavering self-confidence. In 1970, while in his early 30s, he was the 
youngest composer to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize (and the first to receive one 
for a composition of electronic music), and in 1986 he won a megabuck MacArthur 
Foundation Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
If Wuorinen has been loathe to cultivate a personal following, he has regularly 
collaborated with major orchestras to keep his music before the public. Last 
year, Wuorinen completed a four-year residency with the San Francisco Symphony, 
where he also served as the orchestra's new-music adviser. He showered music 
director Herbert Blomstedt with praise for giving his compositions thorough 
preparation and first-rate performances. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra also made a compact disc of Wuorinen's "The Golden Dance" and 
Third Piano Concerto, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist. In January, 1989, the 
composer's only opera, "The W. of Babylon," was given its sole performance in a 
concert setting by the San Francisco Symphony. Subtitled a "Baroque Burlesque," 
the lascivious (according to local music critics) and satirical opera had been 
sitting on the shelf since its completion in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy relationship. I had a very good time while I was there, and our 
relationship will continue. I'm putting the final touches on a work for chorus 
and orchestra that San Francisco will be playing in March." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the time spent in San Francisco working with the symphony, the New 
York native did not discover a distinctly West Coast school of composition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many different approaches -- the range of compositional style is 
so great. How would you put, say, Lou Harrison, John Adams and a Roger Reynolds 
in the same category? The cultural scene is so adrift, you begin to ask, 'Does 
anything mean anything?' " 
</P>
<P>
When Wuorinen ascends the Mandeville Auditorium podium to conduct "Bamboola 
Squared" for orchestra and quadraphonic tape, the piece will finally have come 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape for 'Bamboola Squared' was produced and realized at the university's 
Center for Music Experiment laboratory. The piece was written for the New York 
Philharmonic's 1984 Horizons Festival, which (UCSD professor) Roger Reynolds 
and I co-produced." (Reynolds' music will be featured on the San Diego 
Symphony's next Pulitzer Series program on Feb. 15 at UCSD.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Wuorinen asked the center to retool the tape portion of "Bamboola 
Squared" in the latest electronic technology -- magneto-optical hard disc -- 
for this performance with the San Diego Symphony, the center's wizards could 
not comply. 
</P>
<P>
"The new technology is not as reliable in performance, say, as a clarinet," 
said the centerspokesman, John Lauer. "But we did recompute the file that 
Wuorinen left when he first made the tape in '84 and freshened it up a bit." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's program, Wuorinen will also conduct his 1988 "Machault, mon 
chou," one of the works written for the San Francisco Symphony and dedicated to 
Blomstedt. The Stravinsky pieces will be "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto and 
"Monumentum pro Gesualdo di Venosa."

<LEADPARA>  THE signature of a music festival is its echo in the mind -- the sonic
impression that lingers after the last bouquet of roses has been handed to the
last soloist.;    By that criterion, the Cabrillo Music Festival went out with
flying colors on Sunday night.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CABRILLO'S ECHO WILL BE A PLEASANT ONE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Forget the unsuccessful new compositions heard in its two-week run. Forget
the deficits. Forget the peccadilloes of the orchestra. Forget the worries
about whether the festival's in absentia music director, Dennis Russell
Davies, will keep his word and return in 1992.;    Sunday's finale was
brilliant. Everything came together to tie up the season with a golden bow.;  
 Britten's and Mahler's eloquence on the theme of death and Mozart's eloquence
on life furnished music with provocative polarities.;    Pianist Richard Goode
was exceptional in his articulate, propulsive reading of Mozart's Piano
Concerto No. 25 in C Major (K. 503), one of the finest readings I've
encountered in this Mozart-saturated year.;    The long, grandiose concerto,
which anticipates Beethoven, is a marvel of architecture, articulation,
allusion and affection. The main piano theme of the opening, for instance, is
an upbeat reworking of Papageno's coda of lament from the end of Mozart's
opera "The Magic Flute.";    Mozart left only a couple of cadenzas (solo
display segments) for his late concertos, and none for No. 25. So Goode wrote
his own, and it comes as close to Mozart's style as any I've encountered,
including Daniel Barenboim's likable recorded one.;    Even more to my liking
were Goode's seamless lines, his way of caressing the notes, and his singing
tone.;    John Adams conducted capably, keying closely to Goode's reading.;   
This was the hit-or-miss Cabrillo orchestra's finest evening of the season.
The group was more responsive and richer texturally than in other
performances.;    In Britten's "Sinfonia da Requiem" and Mahler's
tragic-romantic "Kindertotenlieder" ("Songs on the Death of Children"), the
renditions were often stirring and the solos in the latter work often stellar,
thanks to Yvonne Powers (oboe), Patricia Barry (English horn) and Fred
Bergstone (horn).;    In the Mahler work -- the saddest piece I ever hope to
hear -- baritone Sanford Sylvan was not at his best vocally, and his lyric
instrument is too light for this song cycle. But his musical intelligence and
his command of German are so refined that the poems were devastating in their
understatement.;    The "Sinfonia da Requiem" (1940) is a piece of fire and
ice, in which composer Britten meets the dual tragedies of a death in the
family and the growing devastation of World War II with a stiff upper lip.;   
Composer-conductor Adams offers engaging program annotations, but this year's
festival seemed fixated on death, with nine performances over two weekends
presenting death-related music.;    Adams' own compositions were welcome,
though they barely hinted at his stylistic versatility.;    The acoustic
limitations of the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium are something Adams and music
director Davies simply have to bear. The Sunday concert benefited from removal
of the hall's sound-absorbent curtains.;    Despite the problems, the Cabrillo
Festival is an asset to be cherished. The friendliness at Cabrillo is
legendary, from the crowd around the tostada stand in the street to the folks
schmoozing (and not snoozing) in the hall.;    There's a jaunty reveling here
in symphonic programs of 20th-century music that would terrify marketing
directors at many big-city orchestras. There's a bucolic informality, with
musicians in rehearsal togs and conductor Adams in clothes that had a rumpled,
slept-in look. But all were totally engaged in their music-making. It's the
ambiance that opens the door to musical adventurousness.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Cabrillo Music Festival's opening weekend took its listeners through
adventurous modern terrain, with JoAnn Falletta conducting two programs at the
Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.;    The modern scores dealt out in saturation to
the music stands reached a climax at the Saturday matinee, and it proved too
much for some. One fast-wilting out-of-town music critic dashed out to the

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The recession also dampened the impact, with attendance far below past
norms. The biggest of the first three concert crowds was 400 -- less than half
a house.;    But there was recurrent excitement and renewal, especially in
Saturday's new music by emerging West Coast composers born between 1943 and
1957, selected by a six-member jury.;    Imaginative use of ritual;  Upstaging
all the Californians was the Alaskan composer John Luther Adams -- no relation
to the John (Coolidge) Adams conducting other parts of the festival. Adams had
a flair for timeless ritual, with bass-drum tattoos suggesting Inouit
ceremonies. Brass stationed around the higher echelons of the auditorium
played an insistent, mystical music using the ambiguous notes and chords from
the string players' so-called open strings. The hypnotic spatial music
entitled "The Far Country of Sleep" at a quarter-hour was the matinee's
longest, yet it seemed the shortest on the program.;    Two of the five
composers were associated with Stanford University. Ross Bauer showed a
complex organization in his "Neon" (1988), yet it was very easy to listen to,
with its sonic brilliance and soothing textures. The busy piece was like a
platter with a lot of good seasonings. The work was an ebullient
curtain-raiser, with many solos and uncommon sounds in bass clarinet, tuba,
piccolo and other exotica.;    David Jaffe's "Whoop for Your Life!" (1987)
struck me as a bundle of shards trying to find their place within some
structural whole. Jaffe seemed to make a conscious attempt to avoid idiomatic
gestures of orchestral writing, and he showed some of the uninhibited nature
of an action painter, but without all the glue needed to make his eclectic
piece stick together. He seemed uncomfortable with string writing, and he got
his best effects with haunting, heavily muted low brass outpourings.;    Two
others showed an extra-serious bent, such as you'd expect to find around
university composers. The German immigrant Stefan Carow's "Five Pieces for
Orchestra" (world premiere) was an austere, atonal, post-Schoenbergian work of
sparse ingredients, like a Kandinsky painting. The Schoenberg clue lay not
just in the texture, but in the title, which Schoenberg himself had used in
1909.;    Allen Shearer's Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra was a stoical
eight-minute opus, with Barbara Shearer providing the pristine structures of
the solo part.;    Inspired by traditional songs; The night before, Falletta
-- a conductor more notable for her diplomatic, no-nonsense efficiency than
moving performances -- had introduced "Due Ye No. 2" (1987) by the Cantonese
Chen Yi. Chen Yi had been inspired by the traditional songs and dances of
Guangxi Province, China, and harnessed them into a tremendous, uplifting
outburst of both power and sophistication, offering both changes of meter as
well as musical "gates" adroitly separating segments of the seven-minute
span.;    The East Coast violinist Stephanie Chase had made a forceful impact
playing "Serenade," the most platonic of Leonard Bernstein's creations.
Bernstein tied his unusually neoclassical score to Plato's "Symposium," each
of the five sections making allusions to the many faces of love.;   
Considering the theme of love, Chase's approach, like that of conductor
Falletta, was needlessly severe, meeting the considerable rhythmic obligations
with technique and virtuosity. They managed the syncopated jazzy finale well,
but more heart from all the forces, including the unusual orchestra of strings
and percussion, would have been welcome.;    Splashy ending;  Falletta closed
that concert with the splashy Mussorgsky-Ravel "Pictures at an Exhibition,"
indifferently played apart from Tony Clements' marvelously squishy tuba solo.;
   Despite able conductors and some of the most imaginative programs on the
coast, the Cabrillo Music Festival remains below its potential. The orchestra
is widely recruited -- only 30 of the 67 players are from Northern California
-- but it remains short of national-festival norms in its responsiveness,
rhythmic acuity and pitch. I have not heard a really good ensemble here,
commensurate with the festival's high national repute, since 1988.;    For
future hirings, the festival would be well advised to hold musician auditions,
even in New York City if necessary, and forget word-of-mouth from current
players, which is the commonest hiring method currently used.;  Cabrillo Music
Festival; John Adams guest conductor.; Where: Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, at
Center and Church Streets.; When: Nightly Thursdays-Sundays through Aug. 4,
plus weekend matinees. No repeat concerts.; Tickets: $15.50-$23.50. (408)

<LEADPARA>  LIKE "Nixon in China" but in more incendiary fashion, "The Death of
Klinghoffer" transmutes contemporary history into operatic poetry.;    Unlike
the earlier work by composer John Adams, librettist Alice Goodman, director
Peter Sellars and choreographer Mark Morris, the new opera, which received its
world premiere Tuesday at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie, needs some
refinement. But the potential for eventual triumph is there.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After seven performances in Brussels, it will travel over the next year to
Lyons, France; Brooklyn (for its American premiere Sept. 5); Los Angeles; San
Francisco; and Glyndebourne or London, England.;    The subject of "The Death
of Klinghoffer" is the seizure of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in
October 1985 by four Palestinian terrorists and the murder of a
wheelchair-bound American Jew, Leon Klinghoffer.;    The hatreds of Jews and
Palestinians surface here and there, sometimes violently. But the opera, laid
out in two acts of approximately 80 minutes each, deliberately cools passions
into meditations from afar.;    The action, which alternates choruses and solo
declamations, sets the events into a cosmic context inspired by Greek tragedy,
Bach's Passions and the large-scale dance-dramas of the Orient.;   
Introspective beauty;  Adams' music, conducted by Kent Nagano, incorporates
Minimalist mannerisms, neo-Romantic lyricism and sometimes pointed harmonic
acerbity. The solo narrations, like those of most modern operas, cede
principal melodic interest to the instruments. But they possess an
introspective beauty, particularly when enunciated by such sensitive singers
as James Maddalena (the Captain), Sanford Sylvan (Klinghoffer) and Sheila
Nadler (Marilyn Klinghoffer).;    More unusual than Adams' score is his blend
of conventional and electronic instruments and the amplification of all the
singers and instruments. Microphones and loudspeakers are embedded in the set
and the balances constantly modified by sound engineer Jonathan Deans. At its
best, this creates fascinating new sound-colors and invests the climaxes with
powerful energy. At its worst, it muddles and harshens the texture.;    The
production took a considerable time to gather momentum. The prologue and first
act are predominantly contemplative, except for a more animated scene of
everyday life with the Klinghoffers' friends in New Jersey.;    What was
intended as meditative and dreamy turns static and dreary. Everything in the
first act looked and sounded unsure, from the cluttered constructivism of
George Tsypin's unit set, steel girders and pipes ascending on high, to James
F. Ingalls' glaring lighting to Dunya Ramicova's stubbornly workaday
costumes.;    Sellars, his head as usual buzzing with half-realized ideas,
sought to reinforce the deliberate obfuscation of identity in the Goodman
text, in which the laments of the Palestinians and Jews sound poignantly
alike. Morris' choreography looked incongruously formalistic: neat little rows
of dancers doing their balletic turns with little sense of emotional
connection to the drama.;    Concert projections;  The second act, however,
restored one's faith in this team's creative capabilities. The use of
rock-style concert projections, expanding every intimate expression on the
protagonists' faces, enhanced the already vivid acting of Sylvan and of Eugene
Perry and Thomas Hammons as two of the terrorists.;    The opera attained its
finest depths of feeling in the two final scenes for Mrs. Klinghoffer -- the
first in which she heartbreakingly doesn't yet know that her husband has been
shot and the second a bitter denunciation of what she sees as the Captain's
complicity -- and Klinghoffer's farewell, an astonishing "aria of the fallen
body" set in the score as a slow, hypnotic dance.  </TEXT>

FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: Welsh Symphony - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sunday afternoon's Prom concert may have had a 'safe' programme, reasonable
enough for the family-slot in a Bank Holiday weekend, but it never sounded
like mere routine. Conducting the BBC Welsh Symphony, Tadaki Otaka was
freshly attentive to everything.
The longest piece was Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, which has been
fading from the repertoire since the Second World War. Raphael Oleg
delivered it with searching affection, and complete command of its virtuoso
writing - in which he always found good musical sense; Otaka built up the
orchestral music to a grand Brahmsian scale. The central Adagio was both
poignant and imposing, as it should be. A worthy performance of this
concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more Bruch: it is
a pity that not much more Bruch actually lives up to this elevated standard.
Even the choice of concert-opener, Mendelssohn's familiar overture Calm Sea
and Prosperous Voyage, had an extra point here, for Elgar quotes it in the
penultimate variation of his 'Enigma' set which ended the concert.
There was another, more languishing seascape after the interval, when Ann
Murray sang Chausson's Poeme l'amour et de la mer+. She captured a sharp
sense of loss beyond well-bred feeling, almost persuading me that the darker
mezzo voice usually assigned to the piece is not strictly necessary;
meanwhile Otaka - and particularly his cellos - drew out Chausson's svelte
lines with assured poise.
Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance,
emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war-horse being
exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery. Clearly, the
BBC Welsh orchestra is prospering with Otaka.
*****
Friday's concert in the Albert Hall was given over to the music of John
Adams. In the hierarchy of the proms such honours do not come the way of
many contemporary composers; that Adams was favoured is a measure of the
insidious popularity of his works and the brouhaha that has surrounded his
two operas, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer. Adams himself
conducted the London Sinfonietta whose director, Paul Crossley, was the
soloist in Eros Piano.
That piece, sandwiched between Shaker Loops and Grand Pianola Music, proved
the low point. Inspired by the music of Takemitsu it shows Adams' powers of
construction at their weakest, and its language of Skryabin, Berg and
Messiaen rechauffe at his flabbiest. At least Shaker Loops, which
established Adams as a distinctive voice in the 1980s, has stylistic
consistency and strength. There's a convincing integrity about the musical
material and a carefully plotted structure which owes more than a little to
Sibelius.
At least Adams is pleasantly unabashed about all these magpie tendencies,
consciously absorbing all the influences and allowing them to ferment. In
Grand Pianola Music they burst out in glorious profusion, throwing
19th-century triumphalism into the mix as well. The result is coarse-grained
 -there's nothing subtle about the scoring, and the big tune that caps the
second movement is irredeemably banal. But in this case it is done with some
panache and tongue firmly wedged into cheek; when Adams doesn't take himself
too seriously his music seems all the better for it.

Kent Nagano, chief conductor-designate of the Halle Orchestra, has been
touring the country with his new orchestra. On Sunday they arrived home at
the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which
was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends.
It was an ambitious programme  - works by Messiaen and John Adams (composers
with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated)
which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a
lightly glittering account of the complete Stravinsky Firebird score. All
the pieces were executed with exactly the cool confidence and flair that
have been missing in the portfolio of Halle attributes recently. Nagano, as
he told radio listeners in an interval talk, has discerned a pressing need
to re-create the quality of imagination in this orchestra's programming; it
is to this end that his opening series, under the sub-title 'New
Beginnings', has been directed.
The first half, its two offerings, each an attractive contrast with the
other, certainly proved the point. Un Sourire (1989) is the penultimate
composition to have been completed before Messiaen's death earlier this
year. It is a tiny (5-minute) marvel of 'late-music' economy and radiance.
Two strands of Messiaenic thought, the hymnally lyrical and the
birdsong-percussive, are set in block alternation, then brought to repose.
Adams, composer of Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, approaches
his big projects with big confidence; the huge orchestra for Eldorado
(1991), including two synthesisers, wastes no colour-device. This
two-movement symphony  - self-proclaimed rather than immediately evident as
such  - treats with disquieted irony, as well as picturesqueness, two
aspects of West Coast existence.
The movements are two different sound-landscapes: the first, called 'The
Dream of Gold', builds up baleful neo-Shostakovich sonorities; the second,
'Soledades', gradually fills its empty space with tingling, desert-inspired
patterns. Adams, now firmly into his post-minimalist phase, layers his
much-repeated rhythmic and colouristic figures in the manner that appears to
draw on Baroque and various 20th-century (including rock) modes of
articulation equally: his musical language proceeds in cells of activity
forming foundation pillars to support spans of lyrical line.
The idiom is unfailingly appealing, easy to absorb. What troubles me  - here
as in the past  - is the arrival of climactic gestures produced less out of
the heat of argument than through mechanical assembly. Eldorado is a superb
concatenation of applique effects announcing itself up as something
altogether weightier.
Meanwhile, last Thursday and Friday in the Festival Hall there were also New
Beginnings  - of a rather less confidence-inducing kind. The London
Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its newly achieved position as resident
orchestra of the London South Bank Centre with two concerts of triple-decker
form and three-hour length. If the aim of their programme was to suggest the
different kinds of promise for the future that the orchestra now holds under
its chief conductor, Franz Welser-Most, its damp-squib impact must already
be raising anxious eyebrows. To put it bluntly, the concert was either
absurdly ill-planned or all too deftly designed to demonstrate Welser-Most's
interpretative immaturity.
The centrepiece, the Schumann Second Symphony, received a glaring
performance, loveless, lumpy and driven. Unsparkling, bandmasterly accounts
of Prokofiev's Three Oranges Suite and (as encore) the Fledermaus Overture
sank spirits ever lower. The message, alas, seems to be that a highly
talented young conductor learning on the job is not well placed to lead an
orchestra many people still consider London's top-class ensemble into its
much-vaunted New Era.

   New York -- They didn't give John Adams the keys to the
city. Which is just as well, since the composer would have
found the locks jimmied and the cupboards bare at City Hall
and especially at cultural organizations rocked by Mayor
David Dinkins's budget squeeze. But we did our best here last
week for Mr. Adams.
   The Philharmonic played two of his Fanfares in the opening
concert of its first season under Music Director Kurt Masur.
And the Brooklyn Academy of Music played host to the first
U.S. run of the Adams opera "The Death of Klinghoffer," which
is based on the assassination of an American-Jewish tourist
in the Middle East by Palestinian terrorists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Mr. Adams, who has built a career mostly in San
Francisco and lately in St. Paul, this double welcome here
looked in advance like a kind of coming-out party.
   But in the end the man of the hour was not the
Romantically inclined minimalist composer but the newly
appointed head music critic of the New York Times, Edward
Rothstein. Indeed, the most memorable moment of Adams-week
was the sight of a poker-faced Mr. Rothstein striding from
the front of Avery Fisher Hall up the center aisle, ignoring
the cheers from Philharmonic supporters on both sides of him,
as he rushed to his computer on 43rd Street to pour tepid
water on their Masur-fest.
   He didn't much like "Klinghoffer" either, which should
help to feed Mr. Adams's paranoia about critics. But perhaps
Mr. Adams should pay more attention in the future to picking
his friends than to picking fights with his presumed enemies
in the glossy pages of Harvard Magazine. At Fisher Hall, Mr.
Masur, late of Leipzig and a long, apparently happy career as
a conductor and communist, began his debut with some brief
and light American works by Mr. Adams and Aaron Copland,
matched in inequal symbolism by the weighty Seventh Symphony
of Anton Bruckner, first performed in Leipzig in 1884 and
dedicated to Mad Ludwig of Bavaria.
   Mr. Masur produced a rather tentative, almost soporific
evening of mostly loud music. One hoped for better as the
season progresses but couldn't help wondering why the
Philharmonic had gone in Mr. Masur's direction -- to a
foreigner of mature years from one of the most entrenched
bastions of tradition in musical performance -- if it was
indeed looking for a fresh approach, a broadened repertory
and a stronger appeal to a younger audience. Why, for
example, had Dennis Russell Davies -- American, younger but
widely experienced in new and old music, and a superb
conductor -- been allowed to escape the talent search?
   The curious can seek out Mr. Davies across the East River,
where he will shortly inaugurate his first season as
principal conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In the
meantime, the Brooklyn Academy has had to suffer the
indignity of several "Klinghoffers," one of them on the
Jewish New Year. This is the so-called opera cobbled together
by the terrible infant of the contemporary stage, Peter
Sellars, from an Adams score, a libretto by the so-called
poet Alice Goodman and choreography by Mark Morris -- much of
the package having been assembled by fax before the Brussels
premiere last spring.
   Reviewing that production on this page, Manuela
Hoelterhoff found little to love and was especially
unconvinced by the libretto's supposedly even-handed
treatment of Arabs and Israelis: ". . . when both groups
appear on stage wearing identical clothes, the production has
graphically equalized victims and their assassins." One could
go further.
   The real-life death of Leon Klinghoffer was a revolting
piece of thuggery against an innocent old man. So it is
thoroughly obnoxious that Ms. Goodman's libretto matches
scenes of aggrieved Palestinians with a piece of Neil Simon
Jewish domestic comedy. Obviously we are meant to conclude
that the Klinghoffers were trivial suburbanites, sheltered
from want and danger, while his assassins were acting out the
righteous anger of their oppressed brethren.
   A truly even-handed treatment would have included a scene
of wealthy robed Saudis in a gaudy palace in the desert,
nattering on about their latest limo or Learjet paid for by a
loan from BCCI.
   Surely there is nothing in the libretto in an anti-Arab
vein to match the repulsive anti-Semitism that drools from
the mouth of a character called "Rambo": ". . . wherever poor
men/Are gathered they can/Find Jews getting fat./You know how
to cheat/The simple, exploit/The virgin, pollute/Where you
have exploited . . . America/Is one big Jew. . . ."
   Could it be that Mr. Sellars encouraged Ms. Goodman in
this in order to distract audiences from thinking about
"Klinghoffer" with the same musical judgment they would
ordinarily apply to an opera? By almost forcing us into a
posture of moral outrage, they would keep us from noticing
that there is not much here for the voice.
   Mr. Adams has said he wasn't basically interested in
opera. He should have listened to himself, instead of heeding
the temptations of that giggling Mephisto, Mr. Sellars. Much
of the orchestral work is rich and appealing, but I doubt
anyone came out of BAM whistling an aria.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The rise and rise of a shrewd operator - In a
profession where fools rush in, the conductor Kent Nagano has trodden very
carefully indeed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are powerful days for Kent Nagano. A decade after arriving in Europe
as an unknown Japanese-American conductor, he cuts one of the most glamorous
profiles in today's image-conscious music world.
As music director of the Opera de Lyon since 1989, he has played a key role
in developing its international reputation and progressive repertoire. He is
also revitalising Britain's oldest symphony orchestra, the Halle, which he
conducts on Thursday in his first Manchester concert of the season.
Appointed principal conductor two years ago, he has only just begun to make
an imprint on its programmes. In 18 months, he hopes to lead the Halle into
Manchester's new Pounds 42m concert hall.
In a profession where fools rush in, Nagano has trodden carefully. He has
avoided the core classical repertoire, exposing himself only in 20th century
scores which show his analytical grasp and communication skills to
advantage. For his London debut a decade ago, he conducted Frank Zappa. In
Salzburg, he has given lucid performances of Messiaen and Stravinsky. He
champions John Adams' minimalist music on both sides of the Atlantic. But he
has yet to convince large sections of the music business. 'There's too much
plastic,' says one agent, pointing out that Nagano has yet to conduct major
works by Mozart, Verdi and Wagner. 'I think the shine from outside is better
than what is inside.'
Nagano is certainly an image-maker's dream. With his oriental features and
shoulder-length hair, he wows audiences wherever he goes. In Manchester, he
introduces complex modern scores in his soft Californian accent. In
interviews he talks like a campus guru, articulating artistic goals as
'visions and dreams'. 'Music is a sharing experience', he says.
But with Nagano music is rarely a great emotional experience, or one of
spontaneous inspiration. Some orchestral musicians have likened him to a
machine: he rehearses and re-rehearses, demands clockwork precision and
leaves nothing to chance. 'He's a recording producer's dream - he conducts
it exactly the same way every time,' says a member of the Lyon orchestra.
Nagano, 42, whose Japanese grandparents emigrated to California 70 years
ago, carries many traits of his mixed cultural background. He practises the
martial art of Shintaido and married a Japanese pianist. He is a modernist
who speaks of his regard for tradition, an artist with an understanding of
market value, a man with big long-term ambitions who has calculated every
step of his career.
His introduction to Europe came through the French composer Olivier
Messiaen. Nagano, who grew up on a Californian artichoke farm, was
conducting Messiaen's music at Berkeley, and invited the composer to work
with his orchestra. Messiaen was impressed. He brought the young conductor
to Paris in 1983 to help prepare the world premiere of his opera Saint
Francois d'Assise. Messiaen introduced Nagano to artists' agent, Sylvio
Samama, who saw in him a talent worth nurturing. Once his reputation was
established, Nagano walked out on the agency and has never looked back. He
is now said to command around Pounds 15,000 per concert.
Lyon and the Halle were shrewdly chosen. In both cases, Nagano could be
guaranteed a certain amount of limelight, without the competitive
environment of Paris or London. Both had secure artistic foundations and
vast untapped potential.
In Lyon, the Opera was in the midst of a seven-year nomadic existence while
its home was rebuilt. The situation was a godsend for an operatic ingenu
like Nagano. He was able to rehearse and record extensively, choosing the
kind of exotic repertoire which would generate publicity but no unfavourable
comparisons.
Louis Erlo and Jean-Pierre Brossmann, the Opera's co-directors, offered
experience, media introductions and a handsome budget. Nagano was their
conduit to high musical standards and a younger audience. In terms of
personality, Nagano was perfect for Lyon's new high-tech Opera building,
which opened in May last year. His Lyon recordings have won international
awards, and he has now been invited to take the company on tour to San
Francisco and New York.
In Manchester, too, Nagano invested in an organisation at a low point in its
fortunes. The Halle had a worldwide reputation, but was not of worldwide
quality. Eclipsed by orchestras in Birmingham and Liverpool, it needed
awakening from the sleepy conservatism into which it had lapsed since the
death of Sir John Barbirolli in 1970.
At first sight, Nagano was a strange choice. He was barely known in
Manchester, and his repertoire had little in common with the Halle's. The
two have taken time to adjust to each other. Nagano plunged in with Boulez
and Stockhausen, which did not go down well in Bradford and Sheffield. He
tampered with the money-spinning formula for Manchester's summer Proms,
which then made a loss. He made disparaging comments about the orchestra's
recent past, denting the musicians' pride.
He also clashed with David Richardson, the chief executive who recruited
him. The Halle's board of directors sided with Nagano, and Richardson left
two months ago. The orchestra is now being run by Alan Dean, a Mancunian
businessman with fund-raising experience, who says his priorities are to
raise Nagano's profile in the community, increase corporate sponsorship and
reduce the Halle's Pounds 400,000 deficit.
No-one doubts that Nagano was the right man to shake up the Halle. His
predecessor, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, improved playing standards, but had no
public face. Nagano, by contrast, is a crowd-puller - a key factor in the
orchestra's move to the new hall. Nagano talks knowledgeably of the Halle
tradition, which he summarises as 'excellence, innovation and courage. We
have to redefine the tradition, renourish it, refocus it toward the future.'
Critics say the orchestra is sounding refreshed. Nagano has worked hard on
technical aspects - 'almost to the point of putting the players off,' says
Gerald Larner, who has followed the Halle's fortunes since the Barbirolli
era. 'The sound has become smoother, softer - the kind of thing you need for
John Adams. But there hasn't been the same degree of artistic illumination
and inspiration.'
Nagano says there should be no hasty judgments. 'We all agreed from the
beginning that this was a long-term commitment, something with roots that
are going to bring benefits far into the future, and will require patience.
I really feel I'm laying the bricks, assembling the structure.'
The conservative programmes for the current season - plugging important gaps
in both Nagano's and the Halle's repertoire - suggest he recognises the need
for consolidation. Next March and April, they will make the first of a
projected series of recordings. There will be a festival to open the new
hall in May 1996, before Nagano's contract comes up for renewal. 'I've no
doubt he'll use the Halle as a stepping stone - he's a clever operator',
says Larner. 'He's not going to spend a lifetime here, and he would be well
advised not to. But if he can pull the orchestra round, it sets him up for
life for other things.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Vale of Glamorgan festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Proms and Edinburgh may overshadow August, but there are some idyllic
outlying festivals. You could do worse than sample the charms of Presteigne,
a small town astride the picturesque mid-Wales border, where a modest,
friendly bank holiday chamber music event has taken off during the last few
years. But for the charged atmosphere of live contemporary music-making,
make for coastal St Donat's.
This summer's Vale of Glamorgan festival is a minimalist's paradise. David
Williams, the festival chairman, who, with another hat on, helped sway a
healthy Pounds 25,000 grant from the Welsh Arts Council, explains: 'We felt
we should do something constructive, not just for new music in broader
terms, but for living composers. It seemed more positive to concentrate
resources rather than dissipate them, and promote a worthwhile series
focusing on the diversity of contemporary works in particular,
post-modernist music since the '70s.'
The principal sponsors, Allied Steel and Wire (ASW), have proved an added
lifeline, injecting several thousands and, no less important, setting up
gatherings to help widen the sponsorship net.
At Cardiff's unspoiled Victorian Coal Exchange on Bute Square (the city's
former commercial heart), John Metcalf's decidedly adventurous programme was
launched last week with a mesmerising, sold-out evening by the American
composer Steve Reich, fresh from his South Bank triumph with The Cave.
Llandaff Cathedral offers an ampler venue tonight for a full-scale John
Adams concert, climaxing with his celebrated Whitman Civil War setting The
Wound Dresser - like his operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer,
something of a cult piece.
Getting to the outside-Cardiff events is easiest - be warned - by car. But
it's well worth the effort. These attractive smaller venues bring their own
rewards, be it the atmospheric oak-rafted fourteenth century Bradenstoke
Hall, part of St Donat's Castle within the Atlantic College campus, or the
medieval wall-painted St Illtud's Church in Llanylltud Faur (Llantwit
Major), an early Celtic Christian site with the added merits of an adjacent
pub-studded square and a good surfing beach a mere two miles' distance.
Minimalist the diet may have been - but by no means monochrome. The Smith
Quartet, one of Britain's answers to the Kronos, made appearances at both
venues, the hall marginally the better for sound and paradoxically more
intimate, thanks largely to the players being raised on a dais.
Like the 'modernism' it purports to replace, postmodern and minimalist fare
is a mixed bag. The Smiths' reading of the now legendary Different Trains
was somewhat differently balanced from Reich's own - not quite as haunted,
perhaps, but clear and forceful. The South African-born,
Princeton-associated Kevin Volans' Second Quartet, Hunting/Gathering, seemed
to be questing for a style as much as anything. Its repeating motifs and
unfinished paragraphs have all the intensity of a short-running sitcom.
Bones stick out balefully, rather as Steve Martland's Patrol is all sinew -
laborious invention, oddly conventional and quintessentially dull.
But nothing can take away from the dedication of these players. Volans'
Third Quartet, Songlines, like his Rimbaud (and Bruce Chatwin) inspired
Almeida chamber opera The Man who strides the wind (L'Homme aux Semelles de
Vent), was a revelation: riddled with imaginative ideas, well teased out, an
array of string sounds that 'delight the ear and hurt not', that constantly
challenge, dazzle and amaze. And Graham Fitkin's quartet Servant, like the
Michael Nyman encore the following night, gave clear evidence of how
minimalism can successfully subsume native and wider traditions.
You can still catch John Adams tonight at 7.30. Next summer's festival
includes Australian Peter Sculthorpe and - yes - Gorecki. So book early
(Tel. 0446 794848 792151).

through Cupertino's Flint Center, San Francisco and Berkeley, plus some Villa
Montalvo dates. Soloists Ivan Moravec, Andre Watts, Daniel Kobialka, and
Melvyn Tan. (408) 864-8816, (415) 762-2277.;    Festival of the Arts, Foothill
College, Los Altos Hills, through Aug. 18. A little of everything by area
companies, from "Carousel" to "The Merry Widow" to a rare staging of Verdi's
opera "Jerusalem" and a Mozart "Requiem" sing-along too. Prices in the $2-$20
range. (415) 948-4444.;  SANTA CRUZ AREA;    Cabrillo Music Festival, July
25-Aug. 4. Composer-conductor John ("Nixon in China") Adams leads this year's
event as the migrating fest on the coast pulls into Santa Cruz's newly
renovated 970-seat Civic Auditorium. The highly laid-back, informal orchestral
festival is the West Coast's most adventurous one in 20th-century music.
Soloists: Stephanie Chase, Richard Goode, JoAnn Falletta and Dora Ohrenstein.
There's the usual excursion to Mission San Juan Bautista. (408) 429-3444.;   
Carmel Bach Festival, July 15-Aug. 4. This is the most sentimental journey of
the summer, with Conductor Sandor Salgo, heading the rituals for 36 years,
stepping down this August. A heavy dose of Mozart this year, including "The
Magic Flute." (408) 624-2046.;  SAN FRANCISCO;    Mozart &amp; His Time, a
citywide festival through June 30. The vast program of more than 50 events and
150 performances includes concerts, opera, lectures, views of mental health,
zany quasi-Mozartian inventions. (408) 998-2277.;    Chamber Music West, June
3-15. The S.F. Conservatory of Music hosts near-nightly changing concerts, to
include the Tokyo String Quartet, Stuart Canin, Hai-Ye Ni, David Krehbiel.
There are digressions to Saratoga and Berkeley. (408) 741-3428, (415)
665-0874.;    Stern Grove Festival, June 16-Aug. 18. This outdoor park stage
has the greatest weather extremes, but it's all free, every Sunday at 2 p.m.,
unreserved seating and picnic space. Highlights: Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
Afro-Cuban bands, S.F. Ballet, S.F. Symphony, opera, Gilbert and Sullivan,
Smetana's "The Bartered Bride." For season brochure, send an addressed,
stamped envelope to the fest at 44 Page St., Suite 604D, San Francisco 94102.;
   Pocket Opera, PG&amp;E Beale St. Theater, Sundays through June 23. The
funniest, most intimate opera company dreamed up by Donald Pippin roars back
with "The Secret Marriage," "The Barber of Seville," "The Marriage of Figaro"
and a modern-day adaptation of "The Abduction from the Seraglio." (415)
989-1855.;  FARTHER AFIELD;    Hollywood Bowl Summer Festival, July 3-Sept.
21. This summer ritual with amplification and 15,000 folks a night is famous.
The L.A. Philharmonic holds forth, with everyone from Simon Rattle to Henry
Mancini, Itzhak Perlman to Miles Davis. New this year is the conductor that
the San Jose Symphony almost snagged, John Mauceri, as director of the new
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. (213) 850-2000.;    Bear Valley Festival, July
27-Aug. 11. The 7,000-foot altitude adds to the exhilaration as Carter Nice
leads his seventh season. Orchestral concerts with pianist Ursula Oppens, plus
the opera "Carmen" with Hilda Harris. (209) 753-2574.;  WESTERN STATES;   
Oregon Bach Festival, Eugene, Ore., June 23-July 7. The northerly Bach fest is
as eclectic as Carmel's, but with the German orientation of conductor-scholar
Helmut Rilling at the helm. The 22nd season features mezzo Frederica von
Stade, pianist Jeffrey Kahane, and the three trumpeter brothers Laubin from
Germany. Also the Latvian chorus Ave Sol, the N.Y. Baroque Dance Co., and the
Angeles Quartet, in this spectrum of Bach, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Dvorak (the
latter via the opera "Dimitrij," in concert version). (503) 346-5666.;   
Seattle Opera Summer (Wagner) Festival, Seattle, Wash., Aug. 3-24, 1990. After
years of hiatus, Seattle gamely cranked up again its mighty Wagner "Ring"
tetralogy, more than 16 hours of myth and man -- and super-women, too --
sprawling over four days, with casts not on a plane with what San Franciscans
are used to. But San Francisco has discontinued its every-five-years "Ring"
sequence, thus Seattle's "Ring" wins the Western states by default. Using the
1986 Robert Israel production, it features stage director Francois Rochaix,
conductor Hermann Michael. (206) 443-4711.;    Santa Fe (N.M.) Chamber Music
Festival, July 7-Aug. 19. This year the multitude of programs highlight
Shostakovich and his Russian brethren. Chamber music galore, yes -- but with
the spice of Mozart's first opera, "Bastien and Bastienne" (July 11, 13).

S.F. SYMPHONY TO TRY OUT THE HIGHER RISERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The most visible features of the renovation are the much higher, steeper
risers for the musicians, which acousticians Lawrence Kirkegaard &amp; Associates
also had introduced at the San Jose Symphony before Music Director George
Cleve threw them out in disgust.;   Apart from that, you may need binoculars
to spot the labors that shut down the hall for the whole summer. The
see-through overhead plastic panels have gone from round to square, each of
them on a computer-controlled winch allowing fine-tuning.;   The new acoustics
will get their baptism under fire in two weeks when London Records moves in to
record Schubert's "Great C Major" Symphony and Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll,"
with Music Director Herbert Blomstedt again on the podium.;   This week's
mostly Mozart repertory is capped by a salute to the crescendoing freedom
movement in Eastern Europe via Berlioz's rousing "Rakoczy" March for a grand
finale, commemorating a hero of the 1848 revolutions.;   The program also
offers paired treats via the coloratura-soprano vocalist, and for once Flint
Center's repeat concert (Friday night) is getting far more than a fill-in
substitute. Tonight it's the popular star Kathleen Battle, while at Flint it
will be the up-and-coming Harolyn Blackwell, making her Bay Area debut before
her "Don Giovanni" Zerlina at the San Francisco Opera later this month.;   ALL
IN THE FAMILY -- The leadership of the Bay Area's three biggest
performing-arts organizations sounds like a lunch group at the San Francisco
corporate-counseling firm of Hellman &amp; Friedman. Tully Friedman was president
of the San Francisco Opera until last year, while partner F. Warren Hellman's
sister, Nancy Hellman Bechtle, is in her fifth year as president of the San
Francisco Symphony.;   Now the likeliest heir apparent for the board
chairmanship of the San Francisco Ballet this fall is Chris (Mrs. F. Warren)
Hellman, according to sources around town.;   Says one arts board insider, "It
looks like a takeover, but it isn't, because all three of them donate very
generously to the groups.";   SANTA CRUZ PODIUM HARMONY -- Two of America's
brightest conducting stars may become a tandem in conducting the Cabrillo
Music Festival through the 1990s.;   Dennis Russell Davies and
composer-conductor John Adams are integrating their heavy international
schedules to work in Cabrillo compatibly.;   "We're talking to Dennis, he's
talking to John, and they're talking to each other," says Cabrillo Executive
Director Tom Fredericks, who is trying to firm up the Santa Cruz County-based
summer fest's conducting commitments for years to come.;   The likeliest
scenario: Davies returning to conduct in 1992. If and when Bonn resident
Davies decides to move on (and 1993 is a good guess), Adams will become the
successor.;   Meanwhile, Cabrillo wrestles with a 1991 deficit of $60,000,
piled atop the hangover $14,900 from the year before, with recession-related
contribution shortfalls blamed.;   CHANGES -- Marilyn Horne canceled her five
performances as Carmen with the San Francisco Opera because of knee surgery,
but not to worry -- two other American mezzos will replace her into the title
role. Kathleen Kuhlmann will do the opener Oct. 12 and six other performances
of the Bizet favorite, while Denyce Graves will sing Oct. 25 through Nov. 1.; 
 Before the first note of the season is sounded, the San Jose Symphony has
already changed its opening work from Mozart's "La Clemenza di Tito" Overture
to Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" Overture for Sept. 13-15. The conductor,
Michael Palmer, is the latest candidate for George Cleve's job.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  CLASSICAL MUSIC PRESENTERS are going all out for the 1991-92 season, a
development that's about the last thing one might have expected in this year
of tight budgets.;   Sergei Prokofiev turned Tolstoy's epic novel, War and
Peace, into an epic opera. San Francisco Opera's production, its first of this
spectacle opera and its homage to Prokofiev in his centenary year, had at last
count nine singers from Leningrad's Kirov Opera, brought over with the help of
star conductor Valery Gergiev. The production, scheduled to open last night,
will have just seven performances, closing Oct. 2.  </LEADPARA>

Classical Music schedule attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Opera San Jose is mounting The Turn of the Screw, a Henry James ghost story
made deftly musical by Benjamin Britten, at the much-maligned Montgomery
Theater. Later in the season comes something I thought impossible to stage at
the Montgomery: Verdi's large-scale Un Ballo in Maschera, in a production
directed by Michael Edwards of Shakespeare/Santa Cruz.;   Das verratene Meer
(The Sea Betrayed) at San Francisco Opera is based on a Japanese novella,
Yukio Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. Composer Hans
Werner Henze, the leading German opera composer since Richard Strauss, will
make a rare West Coast appearance on opening night, Nov. 7.;   AT THE TOP OF
THE SYMPHONYlist is an imaginative collaboration by three Bay Area presenters,
exploring music in the turbulent transition years 1911-13 in Paris. British
conductor Simon Rattle will lead "The Rite of Spring," among other works, with
his City of Birmingham Symphony, April 24-26 at Cupertino's Flint Center,
Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall and San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall.;   At the
San Jose Symphony, guest conductors are vying for outgoing conductor George
Cleve's job, with the best resume coming from Israeli conductor Gabriel Chmura
(Nov. 15-17). In the remainder of the season, Cleve will play all four
symphonies of Brahms as well as the second piano concerto and the violin
concerto with Rudolf Firkusny and David Abel, respectively, as soloists. He'll
close his term in June with Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony and Mahler's
"Resurrection" Symphony.;   The San Francisco Symphony's enticing season
includes guest appearances by composer-conductor John Adams in the premiere of
his "El Dorado" (Nov. 13-17). Michael Tilson Thomas is back in November,
leading Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4. Among the symphony soloists, I'd
recommend soprano Jessye Norman, pianists Radu Lupu and Mitsuko Uchida, and
violinist Cho-Liang Lin.;   Among orchestras elsewhere, the Bay Area Women's
Philharmonic under JoAnn Falletta will present a premiere-studded night Feb. 1
at Zellerbach Hall. The program includes Darius Milhaud ("Le Boeuf sur le
Toit") and Libby Larsen, whose "Ghosts of an Old Ceremony," a ballet score,
will be danced by the troupe for which it was written, ODC/San Francisco.;  
In a class by itself is the superb Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra under
Nicholas McGegan. The season's pick may just be the opening concert later this
month: Handel's favorite oratorio, "Theodora," in its West Coast premiere.;  
Leading the choral offerings are the Tallis Scholars, singing early music from
MexiCo, Spain and Portugal in a March 1 concert at Berkeley's First
Congregational Church.;   In the South Bay, we look forward to the March 30-31
world premiere of Libby Larsen's "Missa Gaia" ("Mass for the Earth"),
commissioned by Schola Cantorum.;   San Jose Symphonic Choir under LeRoy G.
Kromm will present Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" April 4 and Brahms' "German
Requiem" May 30.;   Classical choruses this year are also exploring African
roots: Schola Cantorum with the "Missa Luba" on its Dec. 13-14 slate and San
Jose Symphonic Choir with its Nov. 9 concert featuring the "African Sanctus"
and Robert Ray's "Gospel Mass.";   San Francisco's renowned a cappella male
chorus Chanticleer travels southward this season. Its Christmas program -- a
certified gem -- will play the Santa Clara Mission Dec. 17 and the Carmel
Mission Dec. 18.;   IN SOUTH BAY CHAMBER MUSIC, YOU could get by remembering
just two names: Stanford String Quartet and the San Jose Chamber Music
Society. The society hosts the quartet Sept. 29 at First Unitarian Church,
where you can check out the newly reconstituted ensemble in Mozart, Elgar and
Quincy Porter.;   The society also plays host to Magnificat Oct. 13 in a
concert version of the 1624 Monteverdi rarity, "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e
Clorinda.";   Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Jeffrey Kahane top the recital
list, though their April 6 program in San Francisco's cavernous War Memorial
Opera House may be barely audible. San Francisco Performances' remaining
lineup includes pianists Evgeny Kissin (Oct. 14) and Andre Watts (March 31),
and baritone Thomas Hampson, the Met's and San Francisco Opera's newest star
(Jan. 17).;   Stanford University will play host (Oct. 11) to India's
best-known musician of the century -- Ravi Shankar, sitar -- who is a
71-year-old Los Angeles resident.;   And for a slice of history: Stanford's
computer-music studio, at its Sept. 27 Frost Amphitheater concert, will honor
Leon Theremin, 95, the Moscow resident who invented the electronic instrument
named after him -- one of the last of the grand old men of modern music.;

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
Bigness Reigns at BAM

   "This is gigantic," said Joe Melillo, director of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
"This is monumental. 
This is jumbo economy-size concert-making!" 
This is composer William Bolcom's setting of William Blake's "Songs of Innocence and Experience," for three choruses, 10 soloists, three conductors and an orchestra, 234 performers in all, and nearly three hours of music. 
For its three performances of the work last weekend, the festival built BAM's opera-house stage out into the audience and removed the acoustical stage shell, but parts of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, including the extra percussionists, still got pushed into the stage's right wing. 
Lukas Foss, the conductor, got an extra-tall podium to stand on, and Harry Salzman, the choral conductor, periodically popped up out of the violas to cue the singers. 
The production required 27 hours of rehearsal and cost $140,000. 

   Symphonic gigantism has a distinguished history: Consider Beethoven's Ninth, Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand and 19th-century performances of Handel's Messiah with choruses of a thousand and orchestras of hundreds. 
Contemporary composers, however, have had trouble getting even their string trios performed, let alone full orchestral works with choruses. 
But lately the tide seems to have turned. 
In 1984, BAM put on Steve Reich's orchestral version of "The Desert Music" for full orchestra and chorus; John Adams set poems of Emily Dickinson for large orchestra and chorus in "Harmonium," and David Del Tredici has written scores of several hours' duration for augmented orchestra. 
William Bolcom is obviously part of this trend to bigness, and he has a typically offhand explanation for it all: "A lot of us feel the orchestra's days are numbered, and we want to get our licks in while we can." 

   Not really as blase as he sounds, Mr. Bolcom is actually pretty amazed that his "Songs of Innocence" has just been produced for the fourth time here. (Dennis Russell Davies did the world premiere with the Stuttgart Opera in 1984, which was followed by a performance at the University of Michigan, where Mr. Bolcom teaches, and another last summer in Chicago.) 
He wrote the piece as a kind of celebration of school spirit: a way to bring together all the music departments at Michigan, and enable as many people to perform as possible. 
He never expected it to be performed "commercially," but has found that orchestras are interested in the work because of its size: "It's a blockbuster, good for gala affairs." 

   Commercial performances seem like a corruption of the work's intent, because it really is a celebration of school (or community) spirit, rather than a professional concert piece. 
"Songs of Innocence" harks back to the days of community music making, when everybody sang or played something, before music was turned over to professionals. 
The fun of the piece is for the people who are in it, and for their friends and family in the audience. 

   Mr. Bolcom also has another theory about the New Bigness: "Maybe big pieces are a way to generate an audience. 
If you have a big chorus, at least you know their families will be there." 

   As a concert piece, however, presented in a major hall, "Songs of Innocence and Experience" doesn't hang together. 
Mr. Bolcom set the songs piecemeal over 25 years, after being captivated by Blake at the age of 17. 
Although he is an academic composer, he is enamored of popular styles -- folk, rock, jazz, reggae -- and has incorporated them into the work, with varying degrees of success. 
Blake's "The Shepherd," for example, is rendered as an expressive country western ballad, and was sung convincingly by baritone Leslie Guinn. 
"The Little Black Boy" is astonishing proof of how an 18th-century poem can fit together comfortably with a 20th-century rock rhythm, although David Caldwell was an insipid exponent of that vocal style. 
The two "Nurse's Songs" were Bolcomized into simple folk melodies accompanied by acoustic guitar. 
Both were sung by mezzo-soprano Joan Morris, the composer's wife, his partner in a highly successful touring act of vintage American songs for voice and piano, and the best soloist in the show. 
"The Little Vagabond," also sung by Ms. Morris, was pure American music hall. 
Mr. Bolcom knows his styles, and he knows how to set text. 

   He can also write in more conventionally "classical" idioms: the heavy, dragging, close harmonies for chorus in "Ah, Sunflower" (performed jointly by the excellent Sine Nomine Singers as "madrigal chorus" and the full, if muddy, Brooklyn College Choir); and the fluid soprano leaps in "The Blossom" and "The Angel." 
Unfortunately, Blake's poems are short, and the styles shift dramatically from poem to poem, without giving the music a chance to build and create any kind of emotional impact. 
This is particularly true in "Songs of Innocence." (Perhaps innocence is inherently less interesting?) 
In the "Experience" sections, some of the poems are paired, which gave Mr. Bolcom more of a chance for dramatic shaping. 
But ultimately, this piece really is the sum of its parts, and while some are very fine, there are too many of them. 
The overall effect is one of surfeit, not unity. 

   This is a pity, because Mr. Bolcom is really a fine composer. 
On Sunday, while the third performance of "Songs of Innocence" was going on at BAM, Sergiu Luca was playing Mr. Bolcom's "Violin Concerto" with the American Composers Orchestra in Carnegie Hall. 
This is a true concert piece that any orchestra should be delighted to program: with its heart-on-the-sleeve adagio movement and with the influence of Joe Venuti's jazz violin in the finale, it makes a statement, speaks for its time and captures its audience. 
It's not gigantic. 
It's not jumbo economy-size concert-making, but it is probably a worthier candidate for the standard repertory than "Songs of Innocence." 
Mr. Bolcom's wicked "Cabaret Songs," performed by him and Ms. Morris on an RCA recording, also show off the composer to better advantage. 

   The Next Wave's presentation of "Songs of Innocence," as part of a heavily trendy festival, hyping its size and touting it as a timeless musical achievement, probably did the work a disservice. 
Listeners could only be disappointed. 
In his defense, Mr. Melillo says: "The Next Wave is chartered, mandated, to be a showcase for large-scale work. 
This production stands as a model of why the Next Wave Festival exists." 
Too bad. 
Perhaps other criteria should have more weight.

<LEADPARA>  NEW classical compact discs keep tumbling out to the stores in record numbers.
Haven't those labels heard about the recession? If so, there's no sign of it
yet.;    Some of the best releases in the last month range from German
romantic music to modern works, and flamenco, too. They include the following:  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FLAMENCO GIVES INTRIGUING TURN TO MASS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Recordings  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Misa Flamenca," by Paco Pena (Nimbus 5288; 41 minutes) --
Guitarist-composer Pena has created a rousing and deeply felt version of the
Mass in Spanish, using the flamenco idiom of singers, guitarists and
percussion. The most remarkable facet of this new recording is the guttural
flamenco singing, as in the powerful soul-searching "Our Father." Also of
note: the "Kyrie" guitar solo by Pena, the insistent thumping of an anguished
heart in "Lamb of God" and the catchy choral singing in the "Santo.";   
Pena's work represents a new Hispanic dimension of the Catholic Mass and a new
liturgical use of timeless flamenco. One of the year's most intriguing
innovations.;    Works by U.S. composers; "American Elegies," Orchestra of St.
Luke's, John Adams, conductor (Nonesuch 979249; 48 minutes, CD) -- The keenly
sensitive renditions here of works by U.S. composers add up to an elegant and
important record.;    Sweet-voiced soprano Dawn Upshaw could make grown men
melt with her tender group of Charles Ives songs, wistfully rendered in
conductor Adams' own arrangements.;    Ives' great orchestral enigma "The
Unanswered Question" is also here, followed by Adams' similarly meandering
"Eros Music," performed by pianist Paul Crossley and the orchestra.;    San
Franciscan Ingram Marshall's environmental "Fog Tropes" includes taped marine
sounds of gaunt beauty. Here, too, are Morton Feldman's minimalist "Madame
Press Died Last Week at Ninety" and David Diamond's old-fashioned "Elegy in
Memory of Maurice Ravel.";    Anti-symphony; ANTON BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 0,
Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, Eliahu Inbal conducting, (Teldec
2292-46330; 44 minutes) -- I have a profound weakness for Austrian composer
Bruckner, whose romanticism, built on massive organ-like chords, can be
overwhelming. Symphonically he went at least one up on Beethoven; in addition
to Bruckner's nine regularly numbered symphonies, he created the early and
little-played Symphony No. 0 in D Minor. The number was his own choice, by way
of rejecting the whole idea.;    Modern scholarship has shown its origins to
postdate the Symphony No. 1, in 1869, coming at least five years after the
date once considered valid.;    To me, it's the first minimalist symphony,
with repetitive phrases producing nearly perpetual motion.;    The recording
is dreadful, the program notes almost incomprehensible. But the piece is
monumental, the melodiousness seductive. The youthful style and conciseness
are refreshing, a whole new dimension for those knowing only later Bruckner.
But for a better zero, go for Riccardo Chailly's recording on London.;   
'Leipzig' version; ROBERT SCHUMANN: Symphonies Nos. 1, 4. Kurt Masur leads the
London Philharmonic. (Teldec 2292-46445; 56 minutes) -- Masur is on his home
turf with Schumann, propelling these works with an inexorable forcefulness, an
attention to structure and no frills.;    For the Fourth -- Schumann's last --
Leipzig resident Masur opts for the first ("Leipzig") version, perhaps out of
chauvinism but more likely in concurrence with Brahms that it was the fresher
and tighter alternative. The orchestra plays with fine attention to detail.;  
 20th-century repertory;  American Piano Sonatas, Vol. 1: Copland, Ives,
Carter, Barber, Peter Lawson, piano (Virgin Classics 7 91163; 76 minutes) --
This release is very welcome, indeed, promising a whole series on timely
20th-century repertory.;    Lawson does wonders with Ives' rhythmically
unusual "Three-Page Sonata" (1905), in some ways the most modern work in the
group. The amiable and energetic Carter Sonata -- the longest on the CD --
helps frame the well-known Barber Op. 26 showpiece and Copland's sensitive
Sonata of 1939-41.;    Sonically, this is a very attractive album. Look for
more to come. (Can we hope for an Ives "Concord" Sonata in Volume 2?)  </TEXT>

OJAI FESTIVAL KEEPS CUTTING-EDGE TRADITION -- WITH A TWIST; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: NEW DIRECTOR STEPHEN MOSKO WILL REPLACE THE OLD AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS 
WITH NEW AND AMERICAN FARE.

<P>
There's a change of direction for the Ojai Festival this year. In the past, the 
annual outdoor event has built a reputation for blending lesser-known music by 
Bach, Beethoven and other established masters with the work of cutting edge 
20th-Century personalities such as Igor Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez, Lukas Foss 
and Peter Maxwell Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mosko, the festival's new music director, plans to maintain the 
cutting-edge tradition, but add a pronounced twist. This weekend, the music of 
Frederic Rzewski, Morton Subotnick, John Adams and Elliott Carter (who will all 
attend) dominates the agenda, replacing any old and European fare with music 
exclusively new and American. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration of the vitality of American music," insisted Mosko by 
telephone from the Bay Area, where he serves as music director of the San 
Francisco Contemporary Players. "The emphasis is not about being academic. It's 
more a fun festival than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko (also known by his lifelong nickname, "Lucky") speaks at a rapid-fire 
pace about the return of tonality, and influences from rock and pop music that 
have helped shape the direction he is trying to emphasize. The conductor, 
composer and teacher, who was born the same year the first official Ojai 
Festival was held in 1947, has also included the works of younger composers 
such as Rand Steiger, Steven Mackey and Art Jarvinen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of us from my generation and younger weren't influenced 
by pop culture," Mosko observed. "And world music has also been an enormous 
influence on composers of our era. I owned my first Ravi Shankar record when I 
was 12." 
</P>
<P>
The annual weekend festival in the Ojai Valley -- 90 minutes northwest of Los 
Angeles -- will present eight concerts in three days, ranging in duration from 
one to three hours. The Ojai Festival Orchestra will be appended by two other 
performance ensembles: Mosko's San Francisco Contemporary Music Players and the 
California E.A.R. Unit. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe more specifically what listeners might expect, Mosko 
pointed to the 1960s and '70s, when composers began to rediscover tonality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a feeling to get back to the immediacy that music can make," he 
explained. "Back in the 1960s when the Fluxus movement was going on, the word 
'minimalism' referred to pieces like those by La Monte Young where a cello 
would play one chord for an hour. I don't know when things got turned around 
with that word. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction by critics to what they now call 'minimalism,' or 'the new 
simplicity,' is more sociological than musical. The music simply tries to 
incorporate methods outside the longstanding European tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko, who holds teaching posts at the California Institute of the Arts and 
Harvard University, has also changed his composition style since early in his 
career when outrageous avant-garde theater and music were going through a 
heyday. He defends the return of tonality in new music. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth with this type of music is that intellectualism goes away if the 
music becomes more intuitive," he said. "But if you examine the canons in Steve 
Reich's 'Desert Music' or the intricacies in the scores of John Adams or Morton 
Subotnick, the complexity is there, even if the music sounds simpler than 
something by Elliot Carter." 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Jeanette O'Conner, who has served in some capacity with the 
festival for the last 11 years, admits that the subscription rate this year is 
lower than in the past -- down 10% from last year. But she says she has no 
regrets as she leaves the Ojai Festival to become the director of development 
for Chamber Music America in New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, traditions are made to be broken," she said. "In Ojai, the locals 
have tended to view the event as crazy music plus Bach and Mozart. This year, 
the strong element will be the crazy music." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are availble by calling (800) 554-OJAI. Single ticket prices range from 
$10-$27.50 per concert, $50-$125 for the entire series of five concerts. Three 
special concerts are not included in the series price.

<LEADPARA>  THE lists of "best serious music of the 20th century" are many. But in most of
them the emphasis falls heavily on the first 50 years, and the second half
gets short shrift.;    One of the victims of such selections is Polish
composer Witold Lutoslawski, who was well received conducting his own works at
the San Francisco Symphony recently, including one I'd include on my own
best-pieces list: his "Concerto for Orchestra." (It will be performed by the
San Jose Symphony in February).  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A CRITIC'S TOP PICKS FROM THE LAST 40 YEARS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     With the century rushing toward its end, this seems to be an apt time for a
critic to present a best-works list for the second half. So here goes -- with
the hope that readers who find something else more arresting will let me know
their choices. (Most of these pieces are available on audio recordings, either
CDs or LPs.);    John Adams' "Nixon in China" is part of a new breed of opera
combining a versatile kind of minimalism with a documentary approach to plot.
The work is based on Richard Nixon's historic breakthrough in U.S.-China
relations, with Mao Tse-tung in a major role. Another Adams work -- "Phrygian
Gates," an appealing piece for solo piano -- almost makes my list, too, for
its demonstration that minimalism can be varied and virtuosic.;    Philip
Glass' "Satyagraha" is another docu-opera, dealing with Mohandas Gandhi's
early work to free the Indian masses from exploitation and discrimination.
Glass' Eastern-inspired minimalism is more doctrinaire than Adams', but it
fits the Indian theme hand-in-glove. Glass uses innovative approaches in both
his operas and concert pieces, making the electronic synthesizer a dominant
accompaniment.;    A third opera, Thea Musgrave's "Mary Queen of Scots,"
demonstrates that an honest historical opera built around a stunning lead
soprano need not revert to derivative music. Her music is fresh, vital and
mildly dissonant.;    Kzrysztof Penderecki's "St. Luke's Passion" is a
choral-orchestral work that embodies new techniques of tone clusters and
microtones to eerie, spine-tingling effect. The texts predate J.S. Bach.;   
Hans-Werner Henze's "El Cimarron," for a male singer-narrator and small
percussion-dominated ensemble, is a brilliant setting for the memoirs of a
freed Cuban slave. This piece -- one of the most memorable works done in
Spanish -- came from a German who lives in Italy.;    Luciano Berio's
"Sinfonia," from the 1960s, was a trailblazer, using the Swingle Singers
alongside the orchestra to voice evocations of Martin Luther King Jr. and
wordless song. The vocal textures are well integrated into this lengthy
orchestral work.;    Olivier Messiaen's "From the Canyons to the Stars" was
inspired by the American prairie, even though Messiaen is French. Maybe it's
an American chauvinism that draws me to this work, but I can't overlook
Messiaen's interest in bird calls, his powerful Christian bent, and his
massive canvas, all realized in music.;    Tod Machover's "Spectres Parisiens"
is the best amalgam yet of live orchestra with real-time electronic sounds --
a provocative medium whose surface has barely been scratched, even though the
technology is all in place. The impatient Machover has moved from Paris to
Cambridge, Mass., and is now composing electronic operas.;    Michael McNabb's
"DreamSong," created at Stanford University's computer-music studios in the
early 1980s, is a piece I'd take to a desert island to restore frazzled
nerves. It conjures up fantastic, restful images in its ultra-sophisticated
soundscape. I lament that the recording is out of print.;    George Crumb's
"Black Angels" was a response to the apocalyptic side of the Vietnam War. It's
a hyperactive, quote-filled string quartet, in which the players also
contribute chants, percussion and whispers. The anguish is palpable. The
string instruments are amplified in this work, perhaps presaging the quartets
of the 21st century.;    Some late symphony of Shostakovich belongs on the
list, but which? Various people will lean toward No. 10 (heard this season at
the San Jose Symphony) or No. 13 (framing the anti-persecution poem "Babi
Yar"). My own favorite, however, is Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14.
This is an inordinately compact work, which audaciously introduced to the
Soviet Union poems from Western Europe, sung hauntingly by a soprano and a
bass over a chamber orchestra. It is to Shostakovich what the "Four Last
Songs" are to Richard Strauss, a summing up of an entire career as an artist.
A professional Bay Area performance of this work is long overdue.;    Igor
Stravinsky's "Variations" is a brief, brilliant orchestral foray into jagged
12-tone music. It comes and goes in the time it takes to cook an egg, but it
offers a lot of appealing seasoning.;    Gyorgy Ligeti's "Aventures" creates
brilliant otherworldly effects. About a half-hour of this choral work was used
for the ape sequence in the sound track of the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Ligeti's tone clusters are chilling and unforgettable.;    Pierre Boulez's
"Pli selon pli" (which translates roughly as "Folded Accordingly"), a work for
soprano and orchestra, is the musical pinnacle of this composer, who
epitomizes the austere, complex style dominant in the '50s and '60s. It has
been revised so often I've lost track, but its constant metamorphosis is part
of the appeal.;    Benjamin Britten's "The Turn of the Screw," a ghost opera
based on the Henry James novel, is a gem of conciseness from a master of
economy and lyricism. A close second on my list of Britten favorites is his
"War Requiem," which speaks with eloquence about the futility and profound
loss of war, while linking soldiers on opposite sides of the front through the
words of British poet Wilfred Owen, who died in World War I.;    For a variety
of reasons, other works warrant mention.;    Some are significant for their
historical importance. Among them:;    (box) Steve Reich's "Clapping Music"
and Terry Riley's "In C," for launching minimalism in the mid-1960s.;    (box)
David Del Tredici's "Alice" series of nearly a dozen big orchestral pieces,
for taking us to a comfy wonderland of rediscovered romanticism, with a
soprano whimsically voicing Lewis Carroll on a bullhorn.;    (box) George
Rochberg's String Quartet No. 3, for signaling an emphatic return to tonality
-- now the dominant style -- in the early '70s.;    Also, Morton Feldman made
a virtue of ultra-slow music; Conlon Nancarrow did incredible rhythmic
juxtapositions with hand-punched piano rolls; and Stanford's John Chowning
developed both frequency-modulated synthesized sound and a phenomenal
electronic simulation of the human voice.;    But my last choice is straight
out of Zen -- a work that comments simultaneously on others' music, on
excessive ritual, on musical theater and on the sonic overload of our age:
John Cage's "4'33," " for one or more instruments. This piece calls for
exactly four minutes and 33 seconds of silence, with the "performer"
theatrically simulating performance in any way desired.;    The 20th has been
a great, crazy, inventive century. I wouldn't trade it for any other -- except
the 21st. (box)  </TEXT>

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: A conductor with a vision - The man behind the the
rising fortunes of the San Francisco Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY in the London Festival Hall and the following evening in the
Birmingham Symphony Hall, the San Francisco Symphony will be winding up its
latest European tour: ten concerts in eight cities in 14 days. Nothing
special in that: American orchestras regularly cross the Atlantic these days
 -not just the Famous Five (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York,
Philadelphia) but several other bands (such as Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and
St Louis) risen to international prominence in recent decades, in equal part
because of their own improved standards and increased 'visibility' via
records.
There is now a widely shared perception that, of all those formerly
second-rank orchestras, San Francisco's has achieved the most remarkable
advances; and since this is most plausibly attributable to the seven-year
partnership forged with the conductor who is leading the European tour, the
American-born Swede Herbert Blomstedt, a special interest must attach to the
latest British encounters with the orchestra.
In the summer of 1990, when the Edinburgh Festival formed the sole British
stopping-point of another European tour, the San Francisco Symphony's two
concerts provided perhaps the purely musical high point of the whole
three-week programme. As I wrote at the time, 'Under Blomstedt the orchestra
has developed into a first-rate ensemble, (and) should be regarded as a
prize catch (for Edinburgh). The first concert was an occasion for broadly
authoritative music-making - not splashy or show-off (Blomstedt, a
restrained, rather sober figure on the podium, would hardly countenance
that) but honestly and powerfully guided by musical concerns'.
Since then, the orchestra's star has continued to rise internationally -
aided by its output of uniformly fine recordings, mainly but not exclusively
on Decca, of 19th-century and late-Romantic symphonies, choral and
orchestral showpieces, and new works by such important American figures as
Charles Wuorinen.
All are made in the Davies Hall, the orchestra's specially built (in 1980)
concert hall, whose acoustics, problematical at first, have recently been
improved by a Dollars 10m programme of overhaul. Serious programme-building,
which the range of San Francisco Symphony recordings reflects, has been a
hallmark of concerts during the Blomstedt years. A Nielsen and Sibelius
specialist, he has also concentrated on Bruckner, in spite of (as he says
himself) a tendency of American audiences to lose concentration during those
spacious long movements.
In addition, new American music has been assiduously promoted - not just
West Coast Minimalists like John Adams but such 'tough nuts' as Carter and
Sessions (whom he cracks himself). Yet Blomstedt has maintained not just the
San Francisco orchestra but San Francisco concert-goers in step with his
vision of what an orchestra should be and do.
Down the Pacific Coast, the youth and good looks of Esa-Pekka Salonen are
hugely magnified on a Sunset Boulevard billboard advertising the LA
Philharmonic. The San Francisco Music Director cuts an altogether different
and, on the face of it, less likely West Coast figure - a lean, Nordically
sharp-featured 65-year-old whose conversation resonates with dry wit and
quiet, cast-iron conviction (he is a devout Seventh Day Adventist).
It was, initially, something of a long-shot appointment. Blomstedt came to
San Francisco highly respected in the profession for his association with
(inter alia) the Danish Radio Symphony and, particularly, for the ten years
(1975-85) he spent with the Dresden Staatskapelle. (A mid-'70s Festival Hall
concert by the Dresden orchestra under Blomstedt, with Strauss first and a
naturally-flowing, magnificently solid Eroica afterwards, has stayed
intensely vivid in my memory.) But he exuded no PR-heightened 'glamour', and
brandished no recording contracts (those came after the partnership was
already launched).
Success came in the most rewarding way - in terms of steadily enriched
orchestral sound, profile and personality. The healthy artistic situation is
economically mirrored: at a time when many American cultural institutions,
and certainly the majority of orchestral ones, are struggling to balance
their books, the San Francisco Symphony has kept its consistently in the
black.
I visited the orchestra at its home base at the end of last year, catching
at the same time the premiere of the Oboe Concerto (coolly lyrical, catchily
percussive, more complex and interesting than first impressions suggest) by
John Harbison which - characteristically - Blomstedt is including in one of
his European tour programmes. (It will be heard in London, alongside the
Bruckner Fourth.) I found that pride in the achievement of the Blomstedt
years runs, unshowily but insistently, through every level of the
organisation. And yet, prior to the December concerts, the conductor had
just shocked everyone by announcing his intention to quit the music
director's post in 1995. The loss will be soothed by his occupation
thereafter of the Conductor Laureate title. But why the departure?
'It is time. I have had a very good period with the orchestra. The quality
of all the sections has improved. The orchestra is now full of fantastic
players. It needed building up, and we have worked on that together. In some
senses an American orchestra finds the great Classical symphonic repertory
harder than the modern music they play: they are very quick in learning the
notes, but there is perhaps a shorter interest span than we are used to in
Europe.'
He has felt cut off from Europe. Artistic connections from the past have had
to be loosened or even put aside for San Francisco. As the fine print of his
work so plainly testifies, Blomstedt is not a conductor for whistle-stop,
minimum-rehearsal guest engagements (he has never appeared with any of the
London orchestras, although probably not for want of invitations). He speaks
movingly of his years with the Dresden players, of the hardships they
endured in GDR times and the uncertainties that now beset them, and above
all of the orchestra's character - 'so warm, with its rich string sound, so
full and natural'.
Where will Blomstedt go after 1995? He is keeping that secret; but wherever
it may be, the appointment must surely promise the conditions in which this
first-rate musician and orchestral trainer can flourish - as he so obviously
has in San Francisco.

   New York -- The job of putting on one orchestral premiere
is daunting enough for most musicians, but four in a single
concert, all of them for flute, smacks of artist masochism.
Nonetheless, flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson recently
brought his Solisti New York Chamber Orchestra together with
three other prominent flutists for just such a blowout in
Town Hall.
   The concert was the culmination of a project that began
several years ago, when Mr. Wilson and fellow flutists Carol
Wincenc and Paula Robison applied for a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts to commission works from
three composers. Each flutist would play all the concertos
and premiere one, thereby ensuring at least three
performances of each work. After some haggling, the trio
tapped Joseph Schwantner ("an established composer,"
according to Mr. Wilson), Robert Beaser ("a new kid on the
block") and Paul Schoenfield ("someone from out of left
field").
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only Mr. Beaser finished his piece, "Song of the Bells,"
on schedule, and Ms. Wincenc premiered it with the St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra in 1987. Cut to 1989-90. Mr. Wilson and
Solisti New York have come to an agreement with Town Hall,
the only presenter in New York willing to take on an evening
of new flute concertos, and they have a concert date. To
round out the program, they have added futuristic flutist
Robert Dick performing his own new concerto. A recording for
New World is lined up. So where are the other concertos? Uhh
. . . they're coming along. Mr. Wilson realizes that
conducting four new works and playing one will probably send
him round the bend, so he enlists the services of Alasdair
Neale, assistant conductor of the San Francisco Symphony,
former flute player, and a crack new-music learner. A few
months before the concert, Ms. Wincenc has the solo part of
the Schoenfield concerto. A week before the concert, the
orchestral parts arrive. "They were full of errors," Mr.
Wilson says. "There were no meters in the score, no bar
lines. . . . Alasdair likes a challenge, but . . . ."
   Conductors are used to the last-minute nature of
premieres, but they don't usually have to deal with more than
one dilatory composer at a time. The entire Schwantner
concerto also showed up about a week before the performance,
and it was hard.
   "Luckily it was beautifully copied and there were no
revisions," Mr. Wilson says. There were other surprises as
well. "No matter what you ask for, you get something
different," says Mr. Wilson of the orchestrations originally
specified in the commissions. The Beaser piece required four
horns. "If the composer says, all I need is one more horn to
make a masterpiece, can you say no?" Mr. Wilson asks. Mr.
Dick's piece called for steel drums, and steel drum sets
aren't uniform in the location of pitches on the instrument.
"Two days before the concert, our percussionists got the
drums and the parts and freaked out," Mr. Wilson recalls.
   Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos" needed a saxophone,
tuba and trombone for its klezmer band, which was ostensibly
meant to suggest the sound of East European Jewish villages
of yore. It also required a singer.
   Five rehearsals, up from the usual three, weren't enough,
but the orchestra coped obligingly with the messy parts and
frequent changes. "They are an easygoing group," Mr. Wilson
says.
   The evening, as you might have supposed, turned out to be
a study of contrasting flute style. After an elegant
performance of Ives's "The Unanswered Question," with the
four flutists (covering all the original wind parts)
responding to the trumpet soloist in the balcony, Ms. Robison
took the stage for Mr. Beaser's "Song of the Bells." The
orchestra laid out a cushioned, exotic tapestry of sound,
from which Ms. Robison, ever a direct and uncomplicated
performer, soared triumphant, like a breath of clear air.
   Mr. Dick's New York club-style attire -- green jacket,
white-spotted black shirt and tie -- announced that his
"Concerto for Flute/Bass Flute, Strings and Percussion" was
going to be from a different musical planet. No more tonal
romanticism: Here was the flute making whistles, multiple
tones and noises like escaping steam. Mr. Dick's eerie sounds
were picked up and amplified by the sound of a violin bow
drawn across a xylophone, and they gathered momentum for the
syncopated, jocular finale. The thud of the bass flute cut
through any preconceptions about the ethereal sound of the
instrument. What noise will he make next, one wondered. The
effect was engaging, but more curious and entertaining than
expressive.
   With Mr. Schwantner's "A Play of Shadows," Mr. Wilson
returned us to the tonal universe. Here again, as in the
Beaser concerto, a harp in the orchestra provided a foil for
the flute. The concerto sounded a lot like Mr. Schwantner's
other pieces; the symmetrical form and the opening and
closing glissandos recalled "A Sudden Rainbow." But
soft-edged, coloristic and Schwantnerian as it was, it was
also more rhythmically jaunty than the Beaser concerto. Mr.
Wilson gave the virtuosic solo part a nuanced intensity.
   The finale, Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos," was indeed
a voice from the shtetl: Yiddish folk melodies in the flute,
a wailing saxophone, a slow, circus march with tambourine,
and finally, the flute commenting on a despairing Yiddish
text about a beautiful, cold girl who comes to a sad end,
sung by a baritone, Douglas Webster. The piece was packed
with local color and entertainment, though the vocal part
didn't add much. Ms. Wincenc, resplendent in a red gown, and
with an edge and abandon to her flute playing, lent an air of
drama to the evening.
   The three commissions have been recorded (Mr. Dick's piece
wasn't included because it hadn't been part of the original
deal, and it wouldn't have fit into the basically tonal cast
of the recording), and the three flutists are now looking for
other places to perform the concertos. Mr. Wilson is happy
with the commissioning experience and says John Adams,
Michael Torke, and John Harbison have all promised him
concertos. Whether he would take on four premieres at a go
again is another question. "If you'd asked me the day before
the concert, I'd have said never again," he says. "But now --
well, sure."

   Ten years ago, composers didn't bother to write pieces for orchestra because they knew they wouldn't be played. 
Today, 17 composers are or have been in residence with major orchestras across the U.S., the fruit of a big-budget program to rejuvenate the orchestral repertoire. 
In addition to acting as the gadfly for contemporary music in his or her host orchestra, something that has met with varying degrees of success, the composer-in-residence also is expected to write a piece for that orchestra. 
The orchestra then performs and records the work, which is released on a commercial label. 

   Five years into the program's projected 10-year span, four records, with pieces by five composers, have been released on Nonesuch. 
Three more already are in preparation, and John Duffy, head of the New York-based nonprofit organization Meet the Composer, which administers the program, says 20 records will be made altogether. 
The five composers already represented offer an intriguing if somewhat disturbing look at contemporary composition as defined by the Orchestra Residencies program. 
The fact is that four of the five pieces sound surprisingly similar. 

   The music directors of the orchestras select their composers-in-residence based on their music. (Another tenet of the program, more devoutly to be wished than actual in some cases, is that the conductor will become the champion of "his" composer's music.) 
All five composers are in their 30s and 40s. 
One, John Adams, chosen by Edo de Waart for the San Francisco Symphony for a job that became the model for the Residencies program, is considered a minimalist, although his compositions bear little resemblance to the works of Steve Reich or Philip Glass these days. 

   None of the others are affiliated with any particular movement. 
Libby Larsen and Stephen Paulus, Minnesota natives and co-founders of the Minnesota Composers Forum, were chosen by Neville Marriner for the Minnesota Orchestra. 
John Harbison, who won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Music, spent two stormy years at the Pittsburgh Symphony at the behest of Andre Previn (Mr. Previn heard a Harbison piece on his car radio one evening and was smitten), and then followed the maestro to his current post at the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
Joseph Schwantner, who won the Pulitzer in 1979, uprooted himself from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., where he is a professor, to be in residence with the St. Louis Symphony and Leonard Slatkin for three years. 
The Slatkin-Schwantner and de Waart-Adams partnerships have been particularly fruitful, with the conductors playing many of the composers' pieces both with their own orchestras and as guest conductors. 

   Not one of these works -- which range from 13 to 40 minutes in length -- should send the audience screaming for the exits. 
If not formally tonal, they all sound tonal, and their dissonances are easy to take. 
Orchestral instruments are used idiomatically, without squeaking strings, prepared pianos or tormented woodwinds. 
There are recognizable melodies and lines, yet what drives most of these pieces is heavy-duty rhythm and experimentation with orchestral color. 
Sometimes there is so much color that you're not really sure what the picture is. 

   Mr. Paulus's "Symphony in Three Movements" falls most heavily into that trap: It is so busy with instruments and motives that it is difficult to see any larger plan for all the details. 
Ms. Larsen's "Symphony: Water Music," on the other hand, is serenely pictorial (according to the liner notes, she has "always found nature the most important inspiration for her music"), and it is fresh, lively and pretty. 
Mr. Schwantner's "A Sudden Rainbow" (the shortest, at 13 minutes) is the least lyrical and most coloristic of the five. 
It uses a lot of percussion, contrasts different sound registers and choirs of instruments for a more transparent effect, and uses a single gesture -- a glissando that represents the sudden appearance of the rainbow -- as a unifying factor. 
Its characteristic use of fragments and color is also recognizably Schwantner. 

   Mr. Harbison's as yet unchoreographed ballet score "Ulysses' Bow" also has a distinctive profile. 
It is a graphic and poetic representation of its story: Ulysses' return from his wanderings, and his ousting of Penelope's suitors. 
Mr. Harbison works out his ideas efficiently in five brief scenes and four even briefer interludes, each with its own identifiable character. 
The orchestra is rich, even Mahlerian. 
The angular, Stravinskian depiction of Penelope's suitors as nasty, taunting children is wonderful, but not all the scenes work as well -- the more lyrical sections are limp. 

   By contrast with the others, Mr. Adams's "Harmonielehre" has an argument, a beginning, a middle and an end. 
The composer does not get lost in coloristic experimentation; he focuses on musical and emotional ideas that he works out. 
The 40-minute piece opens with crashing chords that touch off the disturbance and torment of the first two sections, only to subside into an ethereal vision of redemption in the third. 
The repetitive patterns of minimalism appear, but most often as a kind of throbbing stasis that other voices circle around and rise above. 
It is a deeply disturbing, probing piece, and also the most personal and expressive of the five. 

   Indeed, all of the pieces except "Harmonielehre" occupy a kind of middle ground between a full-throated tonality (as exemplified by the works of David Del Tredici) and the non-tonal dissonance that contemporary composers feel they must embrace in order to be considered serious. 
This is what is coming to be called the New Romanticism. 
It is an idiom that doesn't terrify the audience, but the threat of tameness is dangerous too in the long run. 
Perhaps the orchestra as a medium is bringing out the conservative side of these composers -- the spare, acerbic "Samuel Chapter" for voice and chamber ensemble that fills out Mr. Harbison's record is in quite a different mode from "Ulysses' Bow," for example, as is his "Flight Into Egypt," which won the Pulitzer. 

   Interested conductors point out that contemporary music is becoming somewhat more acceptable in concert halls because composers are writing more "accessibly." 
Are they all -- or are those just the ones being chosen by the powerful Orchestra Residencies program? 
All of these pieces are worth listening to, and whatever their stylistic drawbacks, their existence in performance and on records is an important step forward for American orchestras. 
But one can't help wondering what else is out there.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: OPERATIC LIFE AND DEATH IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boston now has three opera companies -- one rising, one moribund and one newly 
born -- as the historic city closes this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Newly born is Boston Opera Theater, a company established in the spring of 1989 
by some former leaders of Sarah Caldwell's still-embattled Opera Company of 
Boston, and now raising money and support for a 1990-91 season expected to 
begin in December of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be misleading to characterize our group as just disgruntled," says 
Opera Theater executive director Robert Cannon, who at one time was president 
of Caldwell's company. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply, we felt that the time had come to establish a new and dynamic opera 
producing company to take Boston into the next century. Our assessment of the 
previous company was that it could not be reorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Among the national and international artists who will work with the new 
company, Cannon says, are stage director Peter Sellars and his artistic 
associate, Craig Smith. (In Los Angeles, Sellars declined to say more to The 
Times beyond confirming that he would be involved with Opera Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
"But this will be more than a company for Peter, who, after all, has a contract 
in Los Angeles. It will be a broad-based company with an international outlook, 
and one that will bring in important productions from the outside, as well as 
mount its own, new work. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is raising money and putting the pieces together. We 
expect to make a major announcement of our plans in January." 
</P>
<P>
Moribund is Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston, which has yet to announce its 
artistic plans for 1989-90, and is beset by a deficit reportedly in the 
neighborhood of $7 million. Repeated calls to the company netted no one willing 
to speak to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rising out of academia is Boston Lyric Opera. Formerly connected with 
Northeastern University, but recently broken off from that connection, Lyric 
Opera opened its 16th season in a new theater, and with high hopes, last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to general director Justin Moss, a Californian who came to 
Massachusetts from Baltimore Opera, "We have taken a whole new direction with 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
He says two performances of Puccini's "Tosca" in September were sold out and 
artistically successful; yet to come are concert performances of Wagner's 
"Fliegende Hollander" in January and staged "Traviatas" in March. Is there room 
for three opera companies in Boston? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. As a theater town, for instance, Boston has audiences for 
everything. Opera is no different. We have a very educated and discerning 
population." 
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY CHANGES: Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, has 
announced the promotions of Scott Barnard to assistant artistic director and 
Barbara Forbes to ballet mistress, plus the addition of seven new dancers to 
the 1989-90 roster. 
</P>
<P>
New members are: Daniel Baudendistel, who rejoins the Joffrey after dancing 
with American Ballet Theatre and the Lar Lubovitch Company; Pascal Benichou, 
formerly of the San Francisco Ballet; Alexander Brady, formerly with the 
1988-89 Joffrey II Dancers; James Conlin, who has danced with the companies of 
San Francisco and Berkeley; Pierre Lockett, formerly of Dance Theatre of 
Harlem; Jacob Rice, who has performed with companies in Washington State, 
Connecticut and Virginia, and Amanda Smith, a member of Joffrey II Dancers from 
1987 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATING: American Music Week, this year scheduled for Nov. 6-12, will be 
noted locally in different ways: 
</P>
<P>
KUSC-FM (91.5) will present "American Mavericks," a three-part series of 
hourlong sound portraits. The featured music makers are CalArts composer Mel 
Powell (see article on Page 75) Nov. 6 at 8 p.m., Frank Zappa Nov. 7 at the 
same hour and David Byrne Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. In addition, KUSC will host a 
tribute to the music of Duke Ellington, "My Sparkling Parade," to be broadcast 
at 8 p.m Nov. 9. During the same week, KUSC will carry a four-part series on 
the career of composer Cole Porter, to be broadcast at 7 p.m. nightly, Nov. 6 
through 9. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year anniversary celebration of the alternative music festival "New Music 
America" will broadcast live from the Brooklyn Academy of Music at 8 p.m. Nov. 
10. This "New Music America Gala" will feature Laurie Anderson, Meredith Monk, 
Philip Glass and Steve Reich. 
</P>
<P>
"Music in the Present Tense -- The American Composers Orchestra at Carnegie 
Hall," is a four-part series, including the world premiere of Tania Leon's 
"Kabiosile," plus music of Kurt Weill, John Adams, Earl Kim, Duke Ellington, 
Rand Steiger, William Bolcom, Lou Harrison and Elliott Carter. Broadcast times 
are 9-10 p.m. Nov. 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
The music department at the County Museum of Art will launch its special 
programming Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. with "The Ear and the Eye: An Aural/Visual 
Celebration of American Music," in the Robert O. Anderson Building. Musicians, 
including trombonist Miles Anderson, violinist Paul Castellanos and cellist 
James Hoskins will be placed at different spots in the building to improvise, 
"as inspired by the Robert Longo exhibit." Information: (213) 857-6010. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Philharmonic Chamber Music Society will 
offer a concert, Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. in Gindi Auditorium at the University of 
Judaism, featuring music by Dvorak, Lou Harrison and Ingolf Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Violinist Nina Bodnar has been appointed concertmaster of the St. Louis 
Symphony, effective in January. Winner of several prestigious international 
competitions, including the Jacques Thibaud competition in Paris, the 
California-born violinist, 28, has been concertmaster of the Santa Barbara 
Symphony in recent seasons. . . . Dancemaker Lucas Hoving is in residence at 
Pomona College in Claremont this week, teaching modern dance and acting classes 
and, Friday night at 8 in the Mudd Theater, giving a three-part concert 
recalling his life in dance. . . . Michael Vargas has been appointed general 
manager of the 1990 Los Angeles Festival. In his new post, Vargas will oversee 
production of the three-week festival, beginning in September, and plan all 
performance schedules, as well as housing and local and international 
transportation. Vargas has been associated with the San Bernardino Museum and 
City Theatre Company in Pittsburgh. . . . Milton Salkind, president of the San 
Francisco Conservatory since 1966, will retire at the end of June, 1990. In his 
24-year tenure as head of the conservatory, Salkind has overseen growth and 
development of the institution from a 42-student school of limited resources to 
its present size as a 250-student, degree-granting college with a $9-million 
endowment. . . . Sylvia Kunin, originator of the Musical Encounter television 
series and founder of Young Musicians Foundation, will be honored this week at 
the 52nd annual conference of the National Guild of Community Schools of the 
Arts, meeting in Las Vegas, Friday through Nov. 6. Kunin will receive the 1989 
Colonel Samuel Rosenbaum Memorial Award, given for "exemplifying and promoting 
the ideals to which the guild and its membership are dedicated."

<LEADPARA>  LOOK for the San Francisco Opera to announce the awarding of a commission to
East Bay composer Conrad Susa for an opera based on "Les Liaisons Dangereuses"
to make its debut four years from now.;   The focal role of the sexually
ravenous "virtuoso of deceit" Mme. de Merteuil -- played by Glenn Close in the

<TEXT>     Susa, 56, is an inventive composer with good credentials. His "Black River"
has been played by a number of U.S. troupes. His "Transformations" was done by
a subsidiary of the San Francisco Opera a decade ago. His "Serenade for a
Christmas Night" and "Hymns for the Amusement of Children," among other
pieces, have been recorded on both sides of the Atlantic.;   The commission
will be formally announced during the new year.;   Susa should fare better
than Hugo Weisgall. Weisgall, 79, was commissioned by the opera's General
Director Terry McEwen shortly before his departure in 1988 to write "Esther."
The commission was canceled by McEwen's successor, Lotfi Mansouri, two years
later. "Esther" which was to have played this fall, was replaced by Hans
Werner Henze's "Das verratene Meer.";   Next fall, the opera will present
another contemporary opera, John Adams' "The Death of Klinghoffer," in its
West Coast premiere.;   LIVING WITH AIDS -- Credit lyric baritone and
chamber-singer William Parker with courage. Stricken with AIDS, he continues
his singing career, as demonstrated by his performance with the San Jose
Symphony earlier this month, sounding as expressive and round-toned as ever.; 
 Faced with the diagnosis, he has stepped up his professional activity. He
recorded both tragedy-laden Bach cantatas for baritone: No. 56 ("I Want to
Carry the Cross") with the Baroque Choral Guild singers, and No. 82, ("I Have
Enough") with Nicholas McGegan conducting.;   The resulting CD will be
released as a fund-raiser by the Shanti Project, an AIDS-assistance
organization in San Francisco. All the performers and the recording company
(Harmonia Mundi, with producer Rubina Young) are donating their services.;  
Parker has also commissioned a song cycle about death from several composers,
including Lee Hoiby and Ned Rorem. It's scheduled for a January premiere in
Berlin, with Parker as soloist. A New York City performance is scheduled in
June, 1992 -- with several other baritones to help out.;   'MESSIAH' RECAST --
When the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra got to San Rafael for its "Messiah"
concert this month, Elizabeth Blumenstock dropped her violin and pitched in to
sing soprano as an on-the-spot volunteer for the choir. Only five of 13
sopranos in the UC Chamber Chorus were in good enough health to appear. The
rest were victims of the flu and cold bugs that have been devastating
performing groups this month.;   OPERA AND BALLET RESURGENCE -- A lot of
performing arts groups are hurting at the box office, especially in
subscriptions. But the San Francisco Opera went from 94 percent of capacity
attendance last fall to 97 percent this fall, with 1991 ticket sales of $12.8
million. And subscription sales were "up considerably," according to a
spokesman.;   The San Jose Cleveland Ballet also hit two records with this
year's "Nutcracker," logging new highs in single-ticket sales (15,972), which
account for more than 95 percent of the overall tickets sold, as well as
income ($338,872), for the seven performances.;   THE LONGEST-PLAYING RECORD?
-- The Marco Polo record label has announced plans to record all the works of
Havergal Brian (1876-1972), the largely self-taught British composer whose
symphonies make Mahler's look like haiku.;   Brian's 31 symphonies, several
running more than an hour in length, require huge forces, such as the 16
French horns for the Symphony No. 2, or an augmented choir for the Symphony
No. 4.;   He wrote his Symphony No. 25 in 1965, as he was approaching his 90th
birthday.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Had First Quorum 200 Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress this week celebrates a curious but
important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the
first House and first Senate achieved a quorum and were finally
ready to begin the work of the new nation.
   The House marks the occasion today, April 4, three days after
the actual April 1 anniversary. The Senate celebrates on Thursday,
April 6, the actual date of its first working quorum.
   Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the
bicentennials of both houses.
   The Congress established under the Constitution first convened
in New York City on March 4, 1789.
   But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the
two chambers from getting down to business.
   On that first day only 13 of the 59 House members and only eight
of the 22 senators were in attendance.
   Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay.
   The journal of the House noted with monotonous regularity that
``a quorum of the members not being present, the House adjourned.''
   Congress under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history
was about to repeat itself.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. Fisher Ames of
Massachusetts wrote to a friend in Boston. ``The public will forget
the government before it is born.''
   The senators who had managed to reach New York wrote to their
absent colleagues: ``We apprehend that no arguments are necessary
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the
government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.''
   George Washington had been elected the nation's first president,
but could not enter office until the Senate achieved a quorum and
met to count the ballots of the Electoral College.
   From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and House members
were in a state of ``stupor or listlessness.''
   But eventually the required numbers assembled.
   The House, counting its first quorum on April 1 _ April Fool's
Day some have noted _ elected Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg of
Pennsylvania as its first speaker.
   And Fisher Ames, much mollified now that work could begin, said
he was pleased with his new colleagues.
   While there were few ``shining geniuses,'' he said, there were
many who had ``experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of
business.''
   On April 6 the Senate counted its first quorum.
   The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors
and dispatching messengers to inform Washington and John Adams that
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

   The postage stamp honoring the Senate will display the gilt
shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officer's chair in
the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, in use from 1810 to 1859.
   The stamp honoring the House of Representatives features the
fanciful ``Car of History,'' a winged marble chariot which, since
1819, has borne the carved figure of Clio, the muse of history,
over the floor of the Old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall.
   Rep. John Quincy Adams, who served 17 years in the House after
his single term as president, was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a
poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events
unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below.
   Often at odds with his colleagues and irritated by their
conduct, Adams paid tribute to the muse for putting up with the
``wordy war'' conducted by the members.
   There was wit, there was wisdom, he acknowledged. But there was
also ``the conflicting jar of ranting, raving parties, day and
night ...''
   Adams concluded:
   ``Oh! Muse historic _ in thy march sublime
   Still urging onward on the wheels of time.
   Canst thou not whisper to the chosen band
   But for one day to calm their senseless rage,
   And let thy volume bear one blessed page
   Of deeds devoted to their native land.''

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: BALLET OF LOS ANGELES FINALLY PLAYS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he promised in October, John Clifford will bring his Ballet of Los Angeles 
to Los Angeles, for the first time, next Sunday. The 3-year-old touring company 
has been traveling with some regularity across the United States since its 
founding in 1987 -- but has never danced in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, longtime dance observers will note that a Clifford company has not 
danced in Los Angeles since the final local performances of the now-defunct Los 
Angeles Ballet (1975-85) in the summer of 1984; the company gave its finale 
ultimo in San Jose that fall, then formally disbanded the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford said last fall that he hasn't been avoiding Los Angeles, and would 
have been here sooner if "there were no deficits involved." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Ballet of Los Angeles is presenting itself as part of the company's 
spring tour. Two performances will be given in Bing Theater next Sunday at 3 
and 8 p.m. The 11-member touring group will give one program twice: 
Balanchine's "Apollo," Clifford's "Songs of a Wayfarer," and his new "Rio Bar 
and Grill," to music of Milhaud. 
</P>
<P>
The tour dancers: Allegra Kent, Nancy Davis, Leslie Carothers, Antonio Lopez, 
Courtland Weaver, David MacGillivray. Mandy Bawden, Diane Dickson, Diane 
Diefenderfer, Sean Carey, and Stuart Loungway. In addition, two New York City 
Ballet principals, both of them alumni of the old Los Angeles Ballet, will 
dance here. They are Darci Kistler and Damian Woetzel. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from his rehearsal studio last week, Clifford specified that 
Kistler and Woetzel "are not appearing as guest artists, but as alumni (of the 
former company)." 
</P>
<P>
"I did not put them on these performances because I did not want to exploit 
them," Clifford said. "And also so as not to create the impression that this is 
a company that presents guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like Los Angeles to see what we have -- also what we had. Many of 
these dancers are Los Angeles people. I live here, and make it my base for 
touring. I am really dedicated to Los Angeles, and this is really an L.A. 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Clifford, 42, says the troupe's three years of touring have been successful in 
that "our tours are strictly no-deficit affairs. When we decide to grow and 
settle down, we will have to face (the reality of) forming a board of directors 
and going into the business of fund raising. But so far, just being a traveling 
company, we have not had to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Where would he like to settle? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to locate where I'm wanted. But, if Los Angeles doesn't want this 
company, there is a lot of interest in Orange County. They certainly want the 
arts down there." 
</P>
<P>
SELLARS IN BOSTON: Every time Peter Sellars starts a new project, Angelenos 
hold their breath. Last weekend Sellars surfaced in Boston to officially 
announce the formation of a company called Boston Opera Theater. Adding this to 
his other ventures here and in Europe, one might wonder how the artistic 
director of the Los Angeles Festival can keep his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Sellars' answer to this question was unequivocal. "My major 
commitment is to the L.A. Festival, which is where I live. Here in Boston I am 
only an adviser." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Sellars' only obligation to Boston Opera Theater is to assist in 
reviving his trilogy of Mozart/Da Ponte operas over several seasons, starting 
with "The Marriage of Figaro" in January. After dozens of performances of these 
works, which originated at the PepsiCo Festival in New York, later in Vienna 
and Paris, reviving the productions in Boston will require a minimal time 
commitment, Sellars said. 
</P>
<P>
"These productions, created with a core of artists who make Boston their home, 
have been in a range of cultural capitals but never in Boston. I am pleased 
that a cycle of work, begun seven years ago, reaches its conclusion, at last, 
in our hometown." 
</P>
<P>
Among Sellars' projects is his first film. It's being produced for this year's 
L.A. Festival and is titled "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez." It is Sellars' spoof 
of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," the silent screen Fritz Lang classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my feature-length silent film in color, with a score by John Adams. It 
will be great. It's going to be shot in June," Sellars said, "on location in 
New York. Then I edit it in July and August and it premieres in Hollywood Bowl 
during the Festival with the Los Angeles Philharmonic playing the John Adams 
score live." 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he stages the John Adams opera "Klinghoffer," based on the story of 
the American Leon Klinghoffer, who was killed by hijackers on board the Italian 
liner Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
Another frequent Sellars collaborator -- the avant-garde dancer/choreographer 
Mark Morris -- also has a prominent role in "Klinghoffer" as well. The new 
opera will receive its world premiere in Brussels, then goes to Lyons, 
Brooklyn, Los Angeles (for the 1991 festival) and then San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars also confirmed "what the world already knows" that he will stage 
Olivier Messiaen's opera, "St. Francois d'Assise" at the Salzburg Festival in 
1992 in collaboration with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Pending a formal 
announcement from Salzburg, Sellars declined further comment. Peter Catalano 
and David Sweet contributed to this column.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: American influences - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The billing for Wednesday's concert by Music Projects/London was 'American
Counterpoints', but this really applied only to Steve Reich's ingenious
Vermont Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to
Colin Matthews' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send-up
(British) of American minimalism and post-minimalism.
Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional
tie-in with the American Art show at the Royal Academy. (There may have been
people there who came expressly to match their impressions of American
abstract painting against aural Reich and John Cage, but how would one
know?) Forget the label: this was a concert full of lively imagination, from
the planning to the execution - bright, inquiring, funny and exhilarating.
Music Projects/London was set up by the conductor Richard Bernas a good
while ago. Their distinguished seniors, the London Sinfonietta, have enjoyed
more continuity of personnel; but the MP/L's track record must by now make
them the leading young challengers. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Wednesday, it seemed to me - I may be wrong - that there were many more
under-25s than the norm for the pricier Sinfonietta concerts.
Yet that was not because the MP/L programme was hot-off-the-stove stuff. On
the contrary, it treated us to ancient, scatty Charles Ives, and John Cage
in his least-known period (a 1947 ballet score for Merce Cunningham, The
Seasons), along with the more recent Reich and Matthews. The ten minutes of
Reich's fresh, extremely clever multi-flute exercise were entirely justified
by Nancy Ruffer's solo playing. The Cage score finds him somewhere between
tranquil, mock-naive formalism and an active urge to scrap Western musical
paraphernalia altogether: fascinatingly dull, not just dull.
MP/L is distinguished above all for its cutting edge and its verve. In
Ives's three 'Theatre Orchestra Sets' - the fullest versions that I've
heard, carefully traced back to the first drafts - everyone in the ensemble
leapt to their opportunities, with full prompting from Bernas. Almost every
piece in these ragbag collections has a different instrumentation, anything
from a woozy wind-band to sighing strings, and each strikes sparks off some
unheard-of idea. That cornucopia of random inspirations, whether radical or
just gleefully silly, was wonderfully bracing to hear. (Some FT readers
might like to know that Ives was all his life a professional insurance man,
apparently with great actuarial breakthroughs to his credit.)
Matthews' beady-eared diatribe, which features scathing parodies of John
Adams in particular and other trendy Americans wholesale, has its own
musical sense and weight too, as the ML/P team made clear. We were hearing
the new 'chamber' version of Hidden Variables, most obviously in its reduced
strings. Aptly tacky, I thought: the budget forces focused the
implausibility of what Adams gets away with on Hollywood-scale strings.
*****
In the Barbican Hall meanwhile, Itzhak Perlman and the London Symphony
Orchestra under Andre Previn were purveying an older, milder brand of
American music: Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto of 1940. This expert piece
of musical craftsmanship, with its curvaceous
Richard-Strauss-goes-to-New-England first movement, gently moody middle and
dashing finale, is today more liable to elicit under-praise than encourage
over-estimation.
It offers no challenge to the listener, no adventure, no threat of uncharted
emotional experience; but within their self-ordained limits its musicianly
qualities remain effortlessly graceful and delightfully fresh. Perhaps a
grander style of musical address, a riper rhetorical character was intended
by Barber than Perlman essayed in the solo-writing, or than Previn charged
from the orchestral accompaniment; but for shining sweetness and purity of
style this violinist has no equals today.
This was altogether a fine, civilised performance, and after the interval
Previn and the LSO matched it with an Elgar Second Symphony of easy flow and
sustainment of symphonic argument. Again, certain Elgarians in the audience
might have found their cravings for passionate engagement with the score's
melodic shapes unsatisfied (from Elgar's own recording of the work with the
LSO we know how high a value he set on full-bodied portamento
string-phrasing). But in its truthful, uninflated authority, Previn's
command of the symphony is now solidly impressive from first note to last.

THE GROWING DEBATE OVER MINIMALISM; 
</P>

FOUR COMPOSERS' VIEWS ON MINIMAL MUSIC -- WHERE IT'S BEEN, WHERE IT'S GOING AND

Ever since minimalism appeared on the music scene 25 years ago, academic 
composers have decried the trashing of their complex music language and the 
acceptance, in its place, of a highly simplified -- some say simplistic -- one. 
Their charge: a sellout to commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
The minimalists say the scholars adhere to an "old-boy network" whose in-bred, 
practically impenetrable scores alienate everyone except each other. 
</P>
<P>
With growing alarm and resentment, the old guard watched while these upstarts 
basked in the spotlight and took the prizes: audiences, publicity, career 
opportunities. They festered. They stewed. For every article on standard-bearer 
George Perle, for instance, there are 500 profiles of the ever-popular Philip 
Glass. For every $10,000 commission given Charles Wuorinen, a $1-million one 
turns up for Steve Reich.

A whole generation has grown up listening to mimimalism's repetitive, 
bare-bones thumping -- in the movies ("The Thin Blue Line"), in dance and opera 
("In the Upper Room" and "Nixon in China"), even in the sanctified museum of 
the concert hall ("Harmonium"). 
</P>
<P>
Critics and commentators have debated the issues but composers tend to be 
closed-mouthed about their peers. Not so Perle and Wuorinen, Pulitzer Prize 
winners, recipients of MacArthur Fellowships and articulate debunkers of 
minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, minimalist John Adams and neo-romantic David del Tredici were 
given opportunities to defend their striking successes. That said, here they 
are in full cry.

Charles Wuorinen: Thanks to Short-Sighted Critics, the 'Quick Fix' Winds Up as 
Most Popular 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wuorinen treads the same path of rigorously difficult composition as an 
Elliott Carter or Pierre Boulez and talks about his "passion" for music as High 
Art. At 51, he is a fierce polemicist, waging verbal wars against what he sees 
as the rising tide of Philistinism. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the status quo, he does not equivocate in laying blame; his finger 
points first to music journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the fault of the critical press," he says, "that people lose sight of the 
difference between the real nature of a thing and how it is promoted." Citing 
an example, Wuorinen quotes Harold Schonberg, former music critic of the New 
York Times, who remarked 10 years ago: "I am going to protect the public from 
new music." 
</P>
<P>
"That statement outraged me," Wuorinen says, explaining how such a prejudice 
fuels public intolerance "to anything but the familiar. Critics are not 
supposed to be indistinguishable from audiences. They're supposed to know more, 
to stretch the limits of listeners' experience. Instead they try to gauge only 
the immediate appeal of a piece," he charges. 
</P>
<P>
What the New York composer is complaining about is the same thing political 
pundits decried in the last presidential campaign: that after televised debates 
between the candidates, TV anchors waited to see the polls before declaring 
winners or losers, thereby relinquishing their own critical evaluation. Yet it 
would seem that arts critics bow less to popular opinion than television's news 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pandering to the least worthy effort just because of its easy appeal serves 
neither the public nor the cause of music," Wuorinen continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Familiarity breeds love, but if audiences never get a chance to become 
familiar with something new, it cannot have an impact. Look at Brahms and 
Tchaikovsky, for instance. It's only because some critics defended their music 
that it is now a concert hall staple." 
</P>
<P>
So have orchestra managements been less than valiant, according to the academic 
proselytizer. He mentions a San Francisco Symphony study, designed to explain 
subscriber dropouts. One woman who let her subscription expire protested being 
duped, he recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"She saw a brochure flagging Isaac Stern and Tchaikovsky and she came expecting 
him to play that composer. As it turned out he performed a new concerto, its 
name buried in fine print, and the orchestra played a Tchaikovsky symphony. Why 
set up that kind of disappointment? Why treat patrons as though they were 
merely customers you're trying to sell toothpaste to? Why not be forthright and 
honorable?" 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Wuorinen doffs his hat to Ernest Fleischmann and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic for championing Boulez, the stellar composer/conductor, 
himself a stern tribune of all that's cerebral in music: 
</P>
<P>
"Is he charismatic? No. Is his music anything but complex? No. There is nothing 
half-hearted or apologetic in the way the Philharmonic presents him. And the 
public responds to the endorsement, the year-in, year-out commitment to what 
Boulez offers." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from such a rarely seen attitude, Wuorinen says, "people have stopped 
trying to be civilized. At one time there was a striving for prestige. 
Compositions had stature because they invoked higher values. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, hardly anyone takes such a stand. What we have is the quick fix, the need 
for instant self-gratification. And that accounts for this utterly 
unchallenging, unprovocative kind of music. In fact, it accounts for the 
general ills of our society -- all the way up to our government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"These days it's a question of how many clap the longest and loudest. Nothing 
is being asked of the creator or the recipient." 
</P>
<P>
Lest his comments be seen as sour grapes, the composer points out that he "has 
as much work, and more, as I can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Wuorinen practices the fire and brimstone that he preaches. In order 
to uphold his lofty standards, he founded a chamber orchestra, the Group for 
Contemporary Music. Without absolutely compelling performances, he argues, 
there can be no persuasion of a difficult work's excellence. Too often, he 
believes, unconvincing accounts of new music give it a bad name. And too often 
symphony orchestra musicians show the same skepticism as audiences. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, players do not embrace the typically simplistic examples of 
minimalism. For example, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic played an excerpt of 
Philip Glass' "the CIVIL warS" several years ago, the musicians deliberately 
turned pages noisily to express their contempt of its incessant arpeggio 
repetitions and limited harmonic interest. 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen, apparently unmollified by this response, fears that "the distinction 
between art and entertainment no longer exists. . . . We've succeeded in 
cheapening art and ruining entertainment. By making popularity the touchstone, 
we rationalize that we're being democratic and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
His favorite anecdote on the subject of music's lowered standards involves a 
composing student who naively told a professor that he wanted to be famous and 
loved and popular. 
</P>
<P>
"How popular?" asked the professor. "As popular as Schoenberg? But Stravinsky 
is more popular than Schoenberg. As popular as Stravinsky?But Beethoven is more 
popular than Stravinsky. As popular as Beethoven?But Tchaikovsky is more 
popular than Beethoven. As popular as Tchaikovsky?But Lawrence Welk is more 
popular than Tchaikovsky." 
</P>
<P>
So much for goals and definitions of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our refusal to be serious," Wuorinen says, "can be seen in this surge of 
anti-intellectualism and yahooism. It's been going on for 25 years. If things 
don't change -- and I don't think they will -- serious music will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John Adams: Dividing Art Between 'Serious' and Unworthy Is Far Too Simplistic 
</P>
<P>
John Adams, a Grammy laureate of different flora altogether, stays happily out 
of academic gardens. Right now, he's fielding phone calls from maverick 
director Peter Sellars, among others, in his hotel room, having just finished 
rehearsing the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra for a concert of 20th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
He says this is a convenient time to talk, "if you don't mind interruptions. I 
have about 15 minutes before rushing out to a dinner engagement." 
</P>
<P>
Adams has barely said this before another call comes in -- this one from Lisa 
Klinghoffer, daughter of Leon Klinghoffer, the wheelchair-bound American 
murdered aboard the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro by an Arab terrorist in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
What the 42-year-old composer of "Nixon in China" and "Harmonium" is doing is 
another opera based on current affairs -- this one recounting the above 
incident. It too will enlist Sellars as collaborator. Commissioned by six opera 
companies, the work will have its world premiere in Brussels in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has already pondered the debate over minimalism. Creators in a given 
field always seem to know who their detractors are and what they're saying. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I couldn't be happier to answer Charles and his criticisms," says 
Adams. "It's something I've never had the chance to do before. Frankly, (pause) 
I think he's a square. 
</P>
<P>
"To make arbitrary divisions between what is serious and what is outside the 
worthwhile realm is just too simplistic. Has he ever considered that 
Shakespeare and Goethe drew on the vernacular? That they were hardly averse to 
referring to their own contemporary culture? This is what Sellars does so 
brilliantly. It's essential to utilize the environment we are part of, rather 
than cut ourselves off from it." 
</P>
<P>
The argument that art and entertainment run along clear-cut and separate paths 
is one that Adams doesn't buy. While he concedes that Lawrence Welk and 
Liberace are "strictly entertainers," too many others defy such easy 
categorization. 
</P>
<P>
He hastens to add that his own music was intended to have entertainment value 
-- "so did Mozart and Ravel acknowledge it, as well as all the great composers 
did, until these self-appointed guardians of theory came into existence." But 
he finds "the dour, grim attitude behind art for art's sake to be phony." 
</P>
<P>
As for minimalism, per se, he does not object categorically to the term. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there's any more antipathy to it than to catch-all labels in 
the past. Picasso probably didn't like being called a Cubist, simply because it 
unfairly limited his identity. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word minimalism is eminently mockable. How many times do we hear the 
standard snipe: 'Minimal music for minimal minds?' " 
</P>
<P>
What Adams is eager to talk about is the genesis of the much-debased form. He 
explains it as a pendulum swing away from the forbidding 12-tone music of the 
Second Viennese School -- a revolt against Schoenberg and his disciples, who 
dominated compositional thought from the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
He sees music composition as having gone through cycles of complexity -- 
"inbreeding to extinction" -- followed by radical reappraisals of language. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Mozart," says the defender of populism. "His music was immensely 
simple compared to the Baroque style, which immediately preceded it, almost a 
contradiction to the kind of involved counterpoint Bach put forth. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still say that our critics, Wuorinen and his elite brotherhood, are 
torchbearers of High Art out of defensiveness. What's getting these guys so 
apoplectically mad is how loved our music is. Whether it, or any other music, 
has value though, no one can be sure of. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be an academic music, a theory music. We (minimalists) exist 
outside of it. Our important feedback comes from the people -- the ones who 
write letters expressing how profoundly affected they are by a piece. As for 
the future, we must hope that the swing does not go too far, that the love 
affair with popular culture does not become an end in itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Perle: Minimalism's Numbers 'Mean Nothing to Me . . . I'm Not Counting' 
</P>
<P>
George Perle, now at UC Berkeley to deliver the prestigious Ernest Bloch 
lectures, takes a morning phone call. The nocturnal composer did not spend most 
of the night working as he often does. So he has the patience to explain that 
his music is accessible without being simplistic, that he is not guilty as 
charged of being an eat-your-peas academic. 
</P>
<P>
An invitation to jump into the fray is less than compelling, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I have little concern with telling people what to listen to and why. Do they 
like it?" asks the 74-year-old detester of minimalism. "Then let them go ahead. 
I won't sit in judgment." Perle takes the opposite stand of Wuorinen. Society 
will find its way, he believes. He need not be a standard-bearer for anyone but 
himself. Indeed, it is only with much cajoling that he addresses the 
minimalists and others who, he says, "have nothing new to say." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Glass, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"What he writes is childish babble. It uses the most superficial aspect of an 
old musical language. People do not come out of the hall humming it because 
it's applied to visual events and doesn't stand alone. It's music for people 
who hate music and can only be looked at historically, as a reaction to the 
misunderstood 12-tone system, which created problems both for audiences and 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
"But surely those old harmonic relationships (Brahms and Beethoven) can find 
better means of preservation than the bare-bones formulas devised by the 
minimalists." 
</P>
<P>
Perle -- who, in his early research into the first 12-tone music, found his 
compositional niche -- has brought that 20th-Century language to a comfortably 
integrated place, one placing him in what he calls the mainstream. Whether that 
mainstream has 1,000 or 1,000,000 listeners swimming in it, though, is 
immaterial. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach is not concerned with popularity," he says, conceding minimalism's 
fascination for the masses. Numbers mean nothing to me. I'm not counting." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to describe his pleasure over the world premiere of his "Windows of 
Order," presented by the Juilliard String Quartet in April in Washington's 
Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Beethoven crowd that filled the hall, people with a sincere and 
developed love for music. But if someone told me I could exchange this for a 
stadium mob of 10,000, I wouldn't make the trade off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an elitist, though," says the esteemed author of contemporary music 
theory. "I come from a working-class background. My favorite novelist is Henry 
James." 
</P>
<P>
But, "I'm also inclined to go to a movie or turn on TV. I don't have to be 
serious about everything." 
</P>
<P>
The scholarly composer points to the enormous growth of music today -- 
including the recording industry, expanded numbers of live concerts, etc. -- 
that comes as a result of greater leisure time. Yet he sees an erosion of 
standards. And worse, "certain colleagues manipulating the public." 
</P>
<P>
"There are those in the business of feeding that public, who don't care about 
it or music -- only their own success. They appeal to trend-seekers and set 
themselves up as arbiters of trendiness. Who is truly on the side of the 
public? I think I am. Not because I'm a nice guy or want to be popular but 
because my music has integrated the 12-tone language into something accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between the complex and the complicated. Mozart was 
complex and so is our spoken language, with its elaborate grammar. But some 
serial music is only complicated. By that I mean artificial, not relevant. 
People think I'm more humane than Boulez, for example, which is hardly the 
point. My music is simply more coherent than his. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the only thing I dislike, although some of its practitioners 
-- like Adams -- are more palatable than others. Quoting hundreds of bars of 
Mozart -- George Rochberg does this -- hardly counts as new music. And 
borrowing a dead language, the way (David) Del Tredici does, is no better. I 
don't want to get personal, but these composers gain no more of my sympathy 
than the Glasses of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"As for minimalism, I think it will grind itself out of existence. But 
something just as bad will take its place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David del Tredici: Good Minimalist Music Will Bring Audiences Back 
</P>
<P>
David del Tredici, at 52, remembers having John Adams as a student in his music 
theory class at Harvard. He's also good friends with minimalist Steve Reich. 
But even this mild-mannered middleman among composers has a satiric epithet for 
Philip Glass: "He's Rossini without melody. I think his music is awful." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Del Tredici has considerable empathy for the minimal movement -- 
for he too belongs to a generation that defected from the hard-core atonality 
that was fashionable until the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember being thrilled by very dissonant music," he says. "Everything I 
wrote at first was in the voguish Schoenbergian mold. So my first attempt at 
tonal music was terrifying. But when I heard the wild roar of approval from the 
audience -- a far different thing from the respectful neutrality that typically 
greeted new works -- I knew it was a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
He's referring to his "Final Alice," an enormously popular piece jointly 
commissioned by the Big Six orchestras -- Los Angeles, New York, Cleveland, 
Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia -- for the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations. It 
earned him a Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
It also earned him an adjective that he is not fond of: accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a synonym for cheap," he says. "The word has a bad connotation. We all 
grew up with the attitude that immortality comes to those who write 'ahead of 
their time.' To be accessible is to lack the wherewithal for immortality. We 
consoled ourselves that no one in Beethoven's day could understand his late 
works. Therefore our music should be inaccessible. Hogwash!Everyone knew back 
then that even his difficult pieces were extraordinary. We've overdone the idea 
of 'ahead of his time.' 
</P>
<P>
"And now the reaction to it -- minimalism -- is also excessive." 
</P>
<P>
But if Del Tredici trembles at the thought of being called accessible, why does 
a somewhat forbidding George Perle crave such a label? 
</P>
<P>
"One man's accessible is another man's forbidding," says the easygoing 
neo-Romantic, who is accustomed to his current outside-the-academy rank as 
composer in residence at the N.Y. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a bad boy today, that is, an anti-scholar, you take up 
minimalism or what I embrace, neotonality. Neither of these has any place in 
the academic hierarchy. That, in itself, attests to their vitality! 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve-tone music has lost its thrill. It's a waning reality, an historical 
fact that doesn't mean anything now. Neither a Boulez nor a Stockhausen has any 
relevance today. But it still takes courage to walk away. Less courage for 
minimalists who are regarded as 'new.' The fact that they're boring is only a 
secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Adams is trying to extend the horizons of minimalism. Steve Reich, acting like 
a spider under a rock, wants to hold onto its static subtleties. However, no 
honest person could deny the powerful influence of minimalism. It begets 
audiences and, in that, gives contemporary music a good name. Where 12-tone 
dissonance sent people fleeing, the best forms of minimalism are bringing them 
back."

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1973, when Michael Tilson Thomas conducted "Four Organs" by Steve Reich on a Boston Symphony Orchestra program at Carnegie Hall, rival factions in the audience bellowed boos and bravos. 
As the 20-minute minimalist work unfolded, with its single, six-note chord repeated obsessively in myriad rhythmic variations, a man in the balcony stood up and cried, "Stop, stop, I'll confess!" 

   "After it was over," recalls the composer, now 51, "Michael said, 'This is great; this is history.' 
And I said, 'Are you sure?'" 

   Today, all-Reich concerts sell out major halls, Mr. Reich's recordings make the top 10 on the Billboard classical charts, and a series of increasingly large-scale works have brought him far from his early minimalist roots. 
Yet his works remain as controversial as ever. 

   Detractors call them "stuck needle" music because of the repetitive rhythmic and melodic patterns. 
Barbs like that are one reason why Mr. Reich attended the New York Philharmonic rehearsals last month of his latest work, "The Four Sections," in "heavy body armor." 
As it turned out, he found "the vibes from the Philharmonic musicians better than they were when the piece was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony" last fall. 
Moreover, Zubin Mehta, whose conducting usually vacillates between the perfunctory and the vulgar, carefully shaped and sustained the swirling canons for strings in the opening movement. 
Images of slow-motion square dances came to mind. 

   Overall, "The Four Sections" is a more restrained work than, say, the rollicking "Sextet" (1985), a personal favorite available on Nonesuch. 
But other performers have brought more bounce to the pulsating rhythms in its faster movements. 

   Indeed, having his works performed by leading orchestras has been a major change for this aging young Turk. 
In 1966, he founded Steve Reich and Musicians, and this cadre of expert players was the primary vehicle for performances of his music prior to 1982. (The group will perform an all-Reich program at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis on Feb. 13.) 
On stage, in their mandatory white shirts, they convey an ardent understanding of Mr. Reich's idiom: richly textured tonal harmonies, colorful percussion and infectious rhythms influenced by African drumming and jazz. 

   They're also accustomed to his "Type A" personality. 
A direct, voluble man who doesn't mince words if, say, the sound equipment isn't up to par on tour, he has tried to maintain similar control over performances of his orchestral works by other entities. 
Mr. Thomas, who led the Brooklyn Philharmonic in the American premiere of "The Desert Music" (1984) and the world premiere of "The Four Sections," notes: "Steve gets involved in everything from the stage setup to the kind of extension cords used to plug in the vibraphones. 
He's very fierce about wanting every detail right." 

   That doesn't always happen in orchestral situations with limited rehearsal time. 
"With my ensemble," says the composer, "we typically spend 36 to 42 hours spread over a few months learning a new piece." 
At the New York Philharmonic, by contrast, Mr. Reich got nearly six of the nine hours of available rehearsal time devoted to his piece -- a generous proportion but considerably less than ideal. 
"It took me the better part of a year to write this piece," he says. 
"So, yes, it's being done and that's wonderful, but where do you as a composer fit into the scheme of things? 
Basically, you're just squeezing under the door." 

   Partly for these reasons, and partly because "I just don't have any more of that in me," Mr. Reich calls "The Four Sections" his farewell to the orchestra for the near future. 
Unlike his so-called minimalist colleagues, Philip Glass and John Adams, he has no plans to write an opera, either. 

   "I hate opera," he declares, running a hand through his short, dark brown hair. 
"The conventions -- aria recitatives, the whole vocal style -- are from another time. 
To change the musical language or the subject matter doesn't set it up for me as a music drama. 
You get composers today who are trying to create something contemporary and immediate, yet once the singers open their mouths you're back into 17th-, 18th-, 19th-century Italy. 
It grinds my gears and it hurts my ears." 

   Instead, he is tackling a piece for string quartet and tape for the Kronos Quartet, and mulling over ideas for a mixed media piece involving his ensemble as well as recorded voices from the World War II period. 
"It's gonna be a whole new page," he says. 
"It will go back to 'Come Out' and 'It's Gonna Rain.'" 
These two seminal works from the mid-1960s use recorded speech on tape loops that gradually go out of phase with each other. 

   In those days, Mr. Reich -- a native New Yorker who studied piano and drums as a child -- was struggling to make the $65-a-month payments on a loft in what is now trendy Tribeca. 
He performed his music for a small coterie of fans from the SoHo art community but didn't consider a compositional career until he enrolled at Cornell as a philosophy major. 
After studies at the Juilliard School and Mills College in Oakland, Calif., he lived in San Francisco, where he supported himself by driving a cab and working as a postal clerk. 

   When he returned to New York and founded his ensemble, his Juilliard buddy Philip Glass came back from Paris. 
For a time, the two shared compositional discoveries and performers. 
To help make ends meet, they even established the Chelsea Light Moving Co., which transported lighting fixtures for Bowery wholesalers. 
As interest in their early minimalist works extended beyond the downtown music scene, however, tensions developed and they became bitter rivals. 
"I've just decided that the less said in print about this the better," says Mr. Reich. 

   Today, he and his wife, artist Beryl Korot, share quarters in a comfortable lower Manhattan loft with their son, Ezra, and two dogs. 
And the composer "walks a tightrope" between performing with his ensemble and writing his music. 
Over the years, he has proved the most intellectually engaging of the minimalists despite pressure from what Mr. Thomas describes as "the arbiters of musical fashion as to whether his works should be more 'uptown' or 'downtown.' 
What's important about Steve's music is that it transcends both those boundaries." 

   It will be interesting to hear how Mr. Reich's music, starting with the Kronos commission, evolves over the next few years. 
"By forcing myself to look at something old, something new, at the same time," he asserts, "I'm sort of dealing myself a wild card." 
From the composer of "Four Organs," we expect no less.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
   A Decade's Diversities
   ----
   By Mark Swed

<LP>
   New York -- To most of the art world, eagerly involved
with the latest trends, the '80s already are old news. But in
the back-to-the-future world of classical music, where
playing centuries-old music on period instruments is often
thought up-to-date, works from the '80s can still seem
glitteringly new. And, for most of us, they usually are. Only
a small fraction of important new work gets recorded, and
that often takes several years. (None of Philip Glass's
orchestra scores of the past decade have yet been recorded.)
Second performances of all but the most popular new pieces
are rare; most musicians prefer the glamour of a premiere.
Unlike in the visual arts, which support several monthly
magazines, there are now, with the recent demise of Musical
America, no commercial American magazines that report on what
is happening in music around the country.
   So Joel Sachs's choice to devote this year's "Focus]"
festival at the Juilliard School to a six-concert survey of
the "American '80s" might have provided an unusual overview
where modern music is going these days had that been his
intention. But, as Mr. Sachs noted in his program
introduction, beyond a noticeable conservative trend in music
that paralleled the political climate of the times, American
music remained as diverse as ever. Partly because
dissemination is so slow, there are fewer stylistic shifts in
music than one finds in the visual arts, and they occur more
slowly. For instance, minimalism, which came and went during
the '60s in painting and sculpture, gradually evolved in
music throughout the '70s to become a mainstream language of
the '80s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The festival did manage to represent most -- although I
counted about three dozen Americans who wrote pieces between
1980 and 1989 that I liked but weren't included -- of the
different kinds of music typical of the past decade, and it
lived up to its diverse billing. It began in gloomy fashion
with the academic expressionism of Leon Kirchner's "For Solo
Cello," and ended outrageously, one week and 36 works later,
with Paul Schoenfield's "Four Parables" for piano and
orchestra, a Gershwin-esque kitsch extravaganza that received
an overexcited standing ovation.
   With no common language, some composers work primarily
with instrumental color (Margaret Brouwer's impressionistic
orchestra piece, "Third From the Sun"). Minimalism's rhythmic
repetition remains so strongly in vogue that Steve Reich's
Sextet sounded almost like a classic in this context. There
arose in the late '80s a young postminimalist generation full
of quirky life, and two of its members, Stephen Dougherty and
David Lang, were represented with alluring works. Number
crunchers like Milton Babbitt are still at it (his brief
"Homily" for snare drum solo is a dazzling exercise in
rhythmic obscurity), and so are the academic electronic boys,
such as Mario Davidovsky, who favor the '50s school of bleeps
and burps (his "Synchronisms No. 9" for violin and tape was
eloquent despite its antiquated electronic sounds).
   Bright Sheng, born in China, colors Chinese folk music
with Western techniques. Chinary Ung, a composer from
Cambodia, illuminates Western muic with an Asian spirit. Lou
Harrison, a Northern Californian, can make clay bowls sound
like a gamelan. Tania Leon, Cuban born, spices her works with
Latin rhythms. David Diamond wrote the same kind of
neoclassical music in the '80s that he wrote in the '40s.
John Cage, whose seventh decade coincided with the '80s, has
never stopped experimenting. Anthony Davis and Muhal Richard
Abrams, composers out of a progessive jazz tradition, are no
strangers to improvisation. Morton Subotnick uses electronic
modifications of standard instruments in performance to
create new cybernetic perspectives.
   Refreshing as it might seem not to have a curatorial point
of view placed on it, such diversity can seem confusing. But
perhaps one of the lessons of "Focus]" and maybe a lesson of
the multicultural '80s as well, is that different traditions
are really different: They don't always mix well and
shouldn't be expected to. So rather than enhance one another,
these pieces often clashed. A gorgeous, richly sensuous piece
for string quartet, "Solstice," by a Southern California
composer, Robert Erickson, was poor preparation for the
rigorous if equally expressive Third Quartet of Richard
Wilson, which followed. Both are terrific pieces, but their
sensibilities are incompatible.
   The Juilliard students who performed this music did not
help. Perhaps the major disappointment of the festival was
the level of performance, which was always proficient but
seldom charismatic or understanding. There were, however, two
important exceptions. The Inja Quartet, which played
"Solstice," is a rapturous ensemble. Cheryl Marshall, a
flamboyant soprano, completely misunderstood the whimsical
theatricality of Mr. Cage's "Sonnekus 2" by acting the tart
in quotations of two Satie songs. But she had the strongest
stage presence of anyone in the festival, and she made up for
the Cage with a wonderfully athletic performance of Joan La
Barbara's heavy-breathing "Time(d) Trials and Unscheduled
Events."
   Mostly though, performances tended to be dour and dutiful,
as if the '80s were a gray era. Important pieces like John
Adams's grim but inspiring "Wound Dresser" or Jacob
Druckman's characterful Third String Quartet came off as
dull. Witty ones, like Pia Gilbert's "Food," didn't sparkle.
Although these performers were growing up during the '80s,
most of them played as if they had had nothing to do with
those times. And it's not a hopeful thought that maybe they
didn't.

FT  20 APR 91 / Arts: This is serious bilge . . .

<TEXT>
IN CASE some of you have not somehow already heard, John Adams's The Death
of Klinghoffer is the new opera about the 1985 hi-jacking of Achille Lauro
by Palestinian terrorists. Its Brussels premiere on March 19 was reviewed
here by Max Loppert, and now it has begun its tour of the globe. It went on
to Lyon and in due course will visit Brooklyn, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. An opera that might have been dedicated to, and at some points
conceived by, Vanessa Redgrave, it is the kind of serious and important
bilge that everyone should see once.
Everyone involved has their better passages. The composer Adams's most
stirring writing is in his choruses and in some orchestration. The director
Peter Sellars's use of huge live video-screens, showing a singer blown-up as
if on TV documentary (shades of Twyla Tharp's Bad News) is striking. Some of
the librettist Alice Goodman's efforts both at vernacular talk and at
lyrical reflection are more successful than others.
But none of this alters the central emptiness and theatrical ineptitude of
this show. Most of Adams's word-setting is drear; even when you can
sometimes make out words and sentences, you lose the drift of paragraphs.
The use of amplification and synthesiser makes us feel we are no longer at a
live performance. Though Goodman's libretto may be influenced by the Bach
passions and certain opera, she is above such petty matters as laying out a
what-happens-next narrative or developing dramatic tension between
characters. And the hand-jive semaphores that Sellars gives his solo
singers, as in his Magic Flute, have neither dynamic sense nor theatrical
dimension.
In this context it is always a relief to see Mark Morris's choreography,
which alone seems to enjoy such basic aspects of theatre as
characterisation, space, rhythmic variety, gestural force. &gt; He is the
greatest choreographer to be working in opera since Frederick Ashton, but
here he is shackled, and his talent obscured.  Morris's most obvious problem
is the monotony of much of Adams's music. But, at a deeper level, the whole
show - even though Morris has long been involved in the planning of it, with
his Monnaie Dance Group - is anti-Morris: by which I mean it is opposed to
what Morris's best work exemplifies.
Time and again, Morris's choreography has shown that his constant theme is
human diversity. In Dido and Aeneas he was both Dido and Sorceress and the
same dancers played, with brilliant differentiation but not a single change
of costume or make-up, courtiers and witches. The point - no-one could miss
it - is to show just how startlingly various each human being can be. 'I am
large, I contain multitudes' could be his motto.
Klinghoffer, by contrast, is about human uniformity; and makes glib swipes
at the West in so doing. &gt; The Prologue is in three parts: chorus of exiled
Palestinians; American family discussing the news; chorus of exiled Jews.
See? Those exiles - they're all the same.
The un-American sentiments of Klinghoffer are, of course, the work of
American artists. The opera tell you nothing about the Middle East but
plenty about white middle-class liberal American guilt. &gt; It displays much
the same thinking as Sellars's Los Angeles Festival did last summer: 'The
American century is over, Eurocentric culture is dead, let's celebrate 'the
other.'' In context of the events of the last nine months in the Middle
East, it is all the easier to see Klinghoffer for what it is: hollow,
pretentious, effete and phoney.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY: 1990'S CLASSICAL SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
BLACK INK TOPS OFF QUIET YEAR

<P>
With apologies to humorist Garrison Keillor, it has been a quiet musical year 
in San Diego. In this Lake Wobegon by the Pacific, not even the dread angel of 
fiscal crisis passed over the city's major musical organizations this year, 
visiting instead the theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
So it is fitting, then, that 1990's biggest story, after a decade of financial 
woes, is that the San Diego Symphony inaugurated the year by retiring its 
$4.3-million debt on Symphony Hall. The combination of a $2.5-million gift from 
San Diego newspaper publisher Helen Copley and the forgiveness of the remaining 
$1.8-million debt by four local banks put the orchestra solidly in the black 
for the first time in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the San Diego Opera, ever-prudent general director Ian Campbell 
maintained a healthy surplus in the company bank accounts for the third year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which both the symphony and the opera began to take 
20th-Century repertory seriously. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera's most successful production of its 1990 season was Francis 
Poulenc's "Les Dialogues des Carmelites" in February. The melodious 1956 opera 
hardly qualifies for avant-garde status, but this austere, starkly realistic 
music drama had never been attempted by the local company. Dramatically 
persuasive and unusually well-sung, the production demonstrated to the 
conservative local opera public that there is viable operatic life after 
Menotti's cloying Puccini reprises. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the Poulenc production, Campbell announced he would include at 
least one challenging 20th-Century opera in each upcoming season. The offerings 
of the 1991 season feature both Benjamin Britten's 1947 comic opera "Albert 
Herring" and American composer Carlisle Floyd's new version of his 1962 grand 
opera "The Passion of Jonathan Wade." 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of concerts at UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium in January and 
February, the San Diego Symphony featured major orchestral works by Pulitzer 
Prize-winning composers Charles Wuorinen and Roger Reynolds. Although these 
recent compositions (none earlier than 1984) were well-received, attendance was 
modest, and symphony management declined to continue this forward-looking 
series. Still, it was refreshing to hear the local orchestra play Reynolds' 
1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning composition "Whispers Out of Time" with authority. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yoav Talmi, who became the orchestra's music director in October, has 
stated that he will integrate contemporary compositions into future symphony 
</P>
<P>
programming, his initial selections have been cautious, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The Samuel Barber violin concerto he conducted on the second concert of the 
season, for example, is stylistically a far cry from either Reynolds or 
Wuorinen. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary music has been the rallying cry of the UCSD music department since 
its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Notable offerings this year included a weeklong festival in early April devoted 
to the music of Iannis Xenakis. If the iconoclastic Greek composer's verbal 
explanations of his complex music provided little insight, the cumulative 
effect of hearing a range of his works in succession ratified Xenakis' lofty 
position in the current compositional pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
SONOR, UCSD's resident contemporary new music ensemble, premiered Reynolds' 
"Personae" in March. This eloquent, chamber-sized violin concerto written for 
and played by UCSD violinist Janos Negyesy may be the vehicle by which 
Reynolds' name enters the American musical mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, meanwhile, despite its smug conservatism 
-- executive director Neale Perl recoils at the mere mention of contemporary 
music -- the well-heeled organization made several notable contributions to the 
local music scene this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the society's aegis, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra brought John Adams' 
new work "The Wound Dresser" to the Civic Theatre in February. The haunting 
work set Walt Whitman's searing Civil War poetry in a rich, if subdued, 
orchestral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, when La Jolla SummerFest's artistic director, Heiichiro Ohyama, 
selected Andre Previn as the annual festival's first composer in residence, it 
raised more than a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Previn's pair of chamber compositions sounded pleasant and slightly 
innocuous. But, if Previn is to be the Trojan Horse for more substantial 
resident composers in the future -- as Ohyama has intimated -- it will be 
another step in the right direction for the sponsoring La Jolla Chamber Music 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Among the memorable performances in 1990, German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz' La 
Jolla recital in October stands out. Beyond the beauty of his lyric instrument, 
the sophisticated and emotionally complex traversal of Schumann's 
"Dichterliebe" and Schubert's "Die Schoene Muellerin" song cycles defined what 
a Liederabend should be. 
</P>
<P>
In May, pianist Emmanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma collaborated in a stirring, 
profound program of Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky and Prokofiev at Civic Theatre. 
Another cellist of the first rank, Janos Starker, brought virtuosity and great 
insight to lesser-known works by Martinu and Cassado at Sherwwood Hall in his 
October solo recital. 
</P>
<P>
In the final concert of SummerFest, the Colorado String Quartet delivered a 
stunning, passionate interpretation of Alberto Ginastera's Second String 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Among the notable conductors to grace local podiums, JoAnn Falletta should be 
at the top of any critical listener's list. Falletta, who is music director of 
the Long Beach Symphony, made her local debut in January with the San Diego 
Chamber Orchestra. The local ensemble has seldom sounded as nimble, responsive, 
and polished. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, German conductor Christof Perick rattled the rafters of 
Copley Symphony Hall with his noble, expansive approach to Bruckner's Fourth 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, American conductor Kenneth Kiesler brought a refreshing 
vision of Handel's "Messiah" to Copley Symphony Hall. His approach peeled back 
pious tradition to get to the oratorio's Baroque roots, and the San Diego 
Symphony and Master Chorale responded with laudable precision and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the disappointments of the year, Paul Dresher's contemporary opera "Power 
Failure" comes immediately to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Dresher's Berkeley-based ensemble brought the minimalist work to the Spreckels 
Theatre in February amid much fanfare, but the opus turned out to be 
dramatically simplistic and musically static in a deadly way. But Dresher's 
low-budget group had no patent on dullness. In April, the San Diego Opera took 
Mozart's inspired "Die Zauberfloete" and imaginative sets by Maurice Sendak and 
somehow managed to squeeze all of the magic out of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the rising Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky made his 
long-awaited West Coast recital debut in La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. His 
shallow interpretations and callous over singing of the all-Italian program 
made many listeners wonder how the judges awarded him first prize in the 1990 
Singer of the World Competition held in Cardiff, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
But no performance was as maddening as guest conductor Alexander Schneider's 
all-out attack on Bach and Haydn at the San Diego Symphony's first Classically 
Baroque concert in November. Anyone with such antipathy for Baroque music 
should be enjoined from even picking up a score by J. S. Bach. 
</P>
<P>
Two passings during 1990 also deserve mention. Zoltan Rozsnyai, music director 
of the San Diego Symphony from 1967-71, died in September at age 62. In more 
recent seasons, he had been music director of the International Orchestra and 
member of the music faculty at United States International University, at which 
the International Orchestra was based. 
</P>
<P>
And the Los Angeles Philharmonic, after a laudable 69 years of playing concerts 
in San Diego, decided to terminate its series after its April 28 Civic Theatre 
concert. Although the local Philharmonic series had once been a coveted season 
ticket, in recent years the demand had waned significantly.

Barcelona and London

<TEXT>
The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in Barcelona, supports a
diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th
year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to
international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured
the music of America's senior composer Elliott Carter (86 in December) and
of the notable Barcelona-born (in 1935) and based composer, Josep Soler.
The first of the concerts I attended was given by the London Sinfonietta and
its new chief conductor Markus Stenz in the Fundacio la Caixa's Centre
Cultural. Carter's 1981 settings for tenor and ensemble of six sonnets by
Robert Lowell, In Sleep, in Thunder (a Sinfonietta commission), came across
in their marvellous intricacy with pungent force if not much tonal beauty, a
lack due not only to the acoustics but to something insistently plain-voiced
about the otherwise impressively deft singer Jon Garrison and to something
stubbornly unlyrical in Carter's nonetheless intelligent vocal writing.
Josep Soler was represented by a short neo-classical concerto for
harpsichord and five instruments which he wrote in 1969 to complement the
famous work by Falla and which the Sinfonietta recorded back in 1976. The
soloist, John Constable, conducting from the keyboard, secured a lively
account of this sweetly bristling 12-tone music, though one discovered from
next evening's concert that the taut idiom no longer reflects Soler's
approach. His Dos poemes per a orquestra (1990-93), performed by the
Orquestra simfonica de Barcelona nacional de Catalunya under Josep Pons,
proved a somewhat neo-romantic affair, the first practically a concerto for
pastoral oboe and rustling curtain of divisi muted strings with unlikely
touches from synthesised organ; the second whipping things up a bit with a
wind machine. Soler's language seems to have become dangerously eclectic,
dicing with kitsch.
The two big movements of Elliott Carter's 1965 piano concerto were complex
not in a playful but a geometrical way; a dense, often dark labyrinth. The
American Ursula Oppens was the staggeringly dauntless, highly experienced
soloist. Pons and the orchestra, with its concertino group gathered round
the piano, performed with truly admirable courage and conviction, though
never approaching an ideal balance of forces and seldom finding the ease and
confidence to animate their jaggedly expressive polyphonic lines rather than
just execute them.
Earlier in the week Oppens gave the Spanish premiere of a five-minute piano
piece, 90+, which Carter recently added to his ongoing series of luminous
little tributes to colleagues, in this case the nonagenarian Italian
composer Goffredo Petrassi. Pitched at a technical level which should not
exclude the gifted amateur, it is a perfect epitome of Carter's dazzling
metrical style and is built on 90 repetitions of the same pulsation, and
then some more, as though to wish Petrassi a few years yet of active life.
One certainly wishes Carter the same: he has just completed an orchestral
piece for next year's Proms and is at work on a voice and piano song-cycle
for next year's Aldeburgh Festival.
***
Russian music of very diverse character was played in two concerts on
consecutive evenings at the Royal Festival Hall by two orchestras, both
conducted by Russians. On Tuesday the Royal Philharmonic under its principal
conductor Yuri Temirkanov gave a neatly contrasted, slightly daring
programme which began with Prokofiev's Suite, Op. 33a from his 1919 opera,
The Love for Three Oranges. These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements
were executed with panache.
Rachmaninov's three Symphonic Dances Op. 45 of 1941 were brought off well
enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's
marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (1979) by a
living Russian, Alfred Schnittke, still echoing in the mind. This often
harshly dissonant work, Schnittke's third piano concerto, in this superbly
thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist Dmitri Alexeev,
came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir Malcolm Arnold.
The music, like Arnold's, touches on jazz and the RPO's principal double
bass, Jack McCormack, plucked out his cabaret tones with style.
Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only
some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects - including a
quiet Moonlight Sonata-like triplet figure for piano, a near-pastiche of the
Russian Hymn from the 1812 overture, and a glissandoing string passage -
which Schnittke's apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be
all of a piece. Alexeev and Temirkanov held one enthralled by the music's
sheer dialectic.
On Wednesday the BBC Symphony Orchestra under its principal guest conductor
Alexander Lazarev gave the UK premiere of the single movement Symphony No 7
(1986) by the Armenian composer Alfred Terteryan (born 1929). His music is
folk-influenced in a far from picturesque way. Here he writes an obbligato
part for the folk percussion instrument called the dap' (Timothy Darside),
which sounded not unlike the Indian tabla. This sound was often multiplied
10 or 11 times by the percussion department, or echoed by a tape recording.
A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the symphony
deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in
material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power. A far cry from Schnittke's
irony, but a cry deserving of attention.

Following traditional Japanese etiquette, San Diego Symphony guest conductor 
Kazuyoshi Akiyama brought a special gift for his hosts. In Thursday evening's 
Symphony Hall concert he conducted the first local performance of Toru 
Takemitsu's "Star-Isle." The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow 
countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably, 
calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones 
from the strings. This brief musical essay by Japan's premiere composer was a 
welcome present indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama stimulated the players in most of the right ways, leading the orchestra 
in one of its more energetic, persuasive programs of the current season. The 
48-year-old maestro -- he is music director of the Tokyo Symphony and New 
York's Syracuse Symphony -- presided over a vibrant, yet thoroughly detailed 
performance of the Samuel Barber Piano Concerto and offered an urgent, 
extroverted interpretation of Debussy's "La Mer." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Barber's concerto was ensured by piano soloist John Browning, 
who premiered the work about 27 years ago under the composer's watchful eye. 
From his brilliant, authoritative octaves that opened the concerto, Browning 
sculpted a taut, muscular reading that left no doubt of his complete identity 
with the music. He was strong but not flashy, creating a wide spectrum of 
colors that made the piano sound almost orchestral. He was meticulous but not 
fussy, an equally apt description of Akiyama's approach to the dense, colorful 
orchestral accompaniment. Seldom has the orchestra seemed so completely engaged 
in its half of a concerto performance. 
</P>
<P>
Barber had both the good sense and the misfortune never to have been 
sufficiently avant-garde for the musical trendsetters of his day. But now that 
his music is again in vogue, and we hear it with more perspective, it is 
instructive to compare Barber with the current crop of born-again 
neo-Romantics. How many of them display even half of Barber's compositional 
craft or can shape a theme as haunting as his Piano Concerto's lavishly lyrical 
slow movement? 
</P>
<P>
If Akiyama made every moment of "La Mer" exciting and urgent, it must be noted 
that Debussy's sea is usually less turbulent under the baton of most 
conductors. It would be instructive to hear Akiyama conduct Bartok or early 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini's tediously sectional overture to "Semiramide" opened the concert, 
although Akiyama paced it judiciously. It seemed little more than a formality, 
curiously unrelated to the rest of the program. Tonight at 8 in Symphony Hall 
this concert will be repeated; on Sunday at 8 p.m. it will be played in Bowers 
Auditorium at Fallbrook's Potter Junior High School.

   Academy Award-winning director Jean-Jacques
Annaud knew what he wanted when he set out to find the lead
character for his acclaimed new movie, ``The Bear.''
   ``I was looking for a John Wayne kind of character,'' Annaud
said. His star is Bart, a 9-foot-2-inch Kodiak bear.
   ``I knew immediately Bart was the bear I was looking for because
he was very reliable, very impressive,'' Annaud said in Friday's
New York Times.
   Annaud, who won an Oscar in 1976 for ``Black and White in
Color'' and also directed ``Quest for Fire'' and ``The Name of the
Rose,'' based the new movie on a 1916 book, ``The Grizzly King,''
by James Oliver Curwood.
   He wanted to make ``a film that would be honest to animal
nature, that would be an adventure film, or thriller, in which an
animal would be the hero.''
   ``I read this novel through the eyes of the hunted, through the
eyes of the victim,'' Annaud said, who found Bart through Utah
animal trainer Doug Seus. ``I saw it was the perfect structure for
having an exciting animal story with all the good ingredients for
movie entertainment, as well as describing what is common to human
psychology and animal psychology.''

   Soccer star Diego Maradona lost some of his
prized trophies and jewels belonging to his financee when his
safety deposit box was robbed during a bank heist.
   Friday's bank robbery at the Banca di Provincia di Napoli was
carried out by a gang of 11 thieves armed with pistols, officials
said. The group entered the bank through a sewer system which runs
underneath the building.
   The robbers held bank employees hostage while cash tills and
safety deposit boxes, including two belonging to Maradona, were
emptied.
   Maradona's friends confirmed that the boxes included some of his
prized soccer trophies _ including the Golden Football presented to
him three years ago by France Football _ and jewels belonging to
his fiancee, Claudia Villafane.
   But they declined to confirm reports estimating Maradona's loss
at nearly $720,000.
   Maradona reportedly was philosophical about the theft, saying,
``A bad day, but the important thing is we're all in good health.''

   Country singer Lionel Cartwright says he
got his start ``out in the sticks'' in West Virginia playing at PTA
meetings and 4-H shows.
   ``I started from the bottom up,'' said Cartwright, who's been
performing for 19 of his 29 years. ``I remember playing at a PTA
meeting that was so far out in the sticks (that) we drove for miles
and when we got there there were about 10 people there.
   ``I played at 4-H shows and civic things and church things,'' he
said. ``I did `Mountain Dew' and `Okie From Muskogee' and a lot of
old country songs.
   ``I never was one to go out and do the latest hits. I liked to
find the album cut or the obscure thing that no one else was doing.
That leads you to try your hand at writing.''
   He wrote ``Give Me His Last Chance,'' climbed to No. 2 on the
country charts last month.

   American composer and conductor John
Harbison, who won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1987, was
appointed creative chairman of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.
   Harbison, who won the Pulitzer for his cantata ``The Flight into
Egypt,'' will replace John Adams for the 1990-91 season, officials
announced at the orchestra's annual meeting Friday.
   Adams, whose initial appointment of one year in 1988 was
extended through this season, said he was relinquishing his
position to work on other projects.
   Adams said he wants to complete his opera, ``The Death of
Klinghoffer,'' about the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   Harbison, 50, will share artistic oversight of the orchestra
with music director Christopher Hogwood and principal conductor
Hugh Wolff.
   Harbison, from Orange, N.J., studied at Harvard, Princeton and
the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. In 1969, he joined the faculty of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as
composer-in-residence for the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1982 to
1984, and for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1985 to 1988.
