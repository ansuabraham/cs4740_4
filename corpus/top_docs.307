<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AMERICAN filmmakers do many things well, but the sophisticated romance isn't
one of them. For this, Hollywood must defer to the French, and on very rare
occasion to the British, who brought us such four-hankie classics as "Brief
Encounter" and "The Go-Between.";    Touchstone's brand new "Green Card" isn't
up to those standards, mind you, but it is something quite special -- a
smartly written and performed relationship picture that assumes a certain
level of intelligence on the part of the viewer. We'll go one further: "Green
Card" makes "Pretty Woman" and "Ghost" look positively arthritic in their
plotting. Why, it even has a continental feel. Translation: the principals
lead interesting lives, have a sense of humor about themselves and can banter
without resorting to profanity.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before rushing to clap Hollywood on the back, we should also add that
"Green Card" stars the great French actor Gerard Depardieu and was directed by
Australia's Peter Weir, best known for "Dead Poets Society" and "Witness"
(remember Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis cheek-to-cheeking to Sam Cooke's
"Wonderful World"). Depardieu's love interest is played with just the right
air of mock indifference by Andie MacDowell, the more conventional sister of
"sex, lies &amp; videotape.";    Together, Depardieu, Weir and MacDowell have
fashioned a slick, spunky little fable about a marriage of convenience that
becomes something more, though not by the same predictable route taken by two
decades of Neil Simon lovebirds.;    Depardieu plays George, a con
man/composer from France. MacDowell is Bronte, an uptown kind of woman who's
big on horticulture and chic environmental causes. He wants to stay in New
York; she wants to stay in her apartment building, which has strict rules
about not renting to singles. They decide to get married -- to get George his
work permit (a green card) and to keep Bronte in her dream home, which comes
complete with a Victorian greenhouse and miniature rain forest.;    It's a
business arrangement, see? Nothing personal. No lingering attachments after
the proper documents are signed. Both shrug nervously and go their separate
ways -- until immigration officers start sniffing around and George and Bronte
must play out a more elaborate charade for the government, her parents and
neighbors.;    Inevitably, just by virtue of their proximity, the two become
better acquainted. In one of the funnier sequences, they go to great lengths
to fabricate a wedding album, complete with Polaroids of winter and tropical
vacations. It's all great fun, but hardly the stuff of lasting romance. After
all, she's kind of uptight and comes with a perfectly predictable beau (Gregg
Edelman), and George is a live-for-the-moment kind of guy with "a past."
Bronte's friends find the hulking, refreshingly blunt foreigner charming;
Bronte, in keeping with her Victorian namesake, finds him loud and uncouth.;  
 Granted, there isn't a great deal going on here. The script at best is a
reversal of the old boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl formula.;   
What makes "Green Card" special is Weir's jumpy pacing and Depardieu's lusty
portrayal. Weir constantly throws his hero into impossible situations, and
Depardieu, that bear with the little-boy grin, improvises with great gusto.
His impromptu  piano recital before a roomful of uptown swells is hilarious.
It, like this movie, is a reminder that we'll buy just about anything,
provided it's delivered with charm and energy.; Green Card;
(star)(star)(star); Rated: PG-13 (slight profanity); Cast: Gerard Depardieu,

   From Tarzan's mate to Gerard Depardieu's
leading lady - that's the amazing range of Andie MacDowell's
fast-rising movie career.
   The South Carolinian made her film debut in 1984 opposite
Christopher Lambert in ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of
the Jungle.'' The movie didn't do much for either performer, and
MacDowell's career languished until last year's ``sex, lies and
videotape.'' The film brought prestigious offers, including one
from Peter Weir (``Witness,'' ``Dead Poets Society'') to co-star
opposite Depardieu in ``Green Card.''
   Touchstone Pictures released ``Green Card'' in limited
engagements before year's end in time for Academy Award
consideration, and the movie will open nationally Jan. 11.
   Weir wrote, directed and produced the story of a Frenchman
(Depardieu) who lacks a green card to take a job in the United
States. The solution: get married to an American. MacDowell needs
to be married in order to rent the ``perfect apartment'' in New
York. Voila!
   MacDowell, a rare beauty whose screen presence belies a basic
shyness, admits she was scared to death at her first meeting with
Weir. ``I wanted to do this film so badly, and I wanted to make the
proper impression. Any time you want to make the proper impression,
you usually don't,'' she said with a laugh.
   ``I left that meeting going over every word that I had uttered,
every movement that I had made. I guess it worked. I got the job.''
   Her first meeting with Depardieu was easier: ``Gerard said in an
interview that I was nervous, and I was. I was more nervous meeting
with Peter than with Gerard. He's very charming, you know, and you
can see immediately how easy and comfortable he is with himself.''
   About the language problem: ``I can get by in French. I would
say that Gerard speaks better English than I speak French. We did
all right. A lot of times he would speak French to me, because I
can understand it. Peter speaks perfect French.''
   Andie MacDowell was born in the small mill town of Gaffney,
S.C., and grew up on both sides of the border between the
Carolinas. The urge to act came early.
   ``Even as a child I loved to entertain. I loved to make people
laugh. I used to put on shows in my garage. I danced in front of
the TV - `Look at me! Look at me!' A little bit of a ham, I guess.
I did theater when I was in college,'' she said.
   ``My mother, who is no longer alive, was very happy that I
wanted to act, and she gave me great confidence. She sustained me.
My father, I think at the beginning was a bit frightened, only
because of the possibility of danger that I was going to the big
city. He had plans for his daughter: he wanted me to be a nurse,
get my education, marry a doctor and have children. Now he seems
very proud that I'm happy.''
   MacDowell did go to the big city, where she studied in a
repertory theater. Playing Jane to Lambert's Tarzan seemed like a
star-making turn, but it wasn't. Her only memorable role afterward
was an unobtainable love in the yuppie melodrama ``St. Elmo's
Fire.'' Then came ``sex, lies and videotape,'' in which she played
the frustrated wife of a philandering husband.
   ``I would say it was the beginning of my career,'' she
commented. ``I didn't know how it would turn out. It was such a
low-budget film with a new director (Stephen Soderbergh). When I
met him, I had complete trust in him.
   ``But you just don't know. It might get made and never
distributed. That was my fear. I thought I would have something on
tape to show casting directors what I was capable of. I knew that I
finally had a role that I could do very well.
   ``I had confidence in myself as far as the role. I didn't think
that anybody knew her as well as I knew her. It touched me in a
very deep place.''
   She feared that people might be narrow-minded about the film's
explicit talk. Not until ``sex, lies'' won first prize at the Park
City film festival did she think that it might be distributed after
all. Then it won big at Cannes, and she thought, ``Well, it really
will get distributed!''
   MacDowell lives with her husband, Paul Qualley, and their two
children in a farmhouse outside New York City. ``I wanted to move
further into the country and live on a farm,'' she said, ``but this
career has sort of taken over my life. This year I lived in
Budapest and Rome and London and New York. I did three films.
   ``I don't think I plan to do three films next year. After so
many years of wanting to do good work, to all of a sudden have the
opportunity to work on three such interesting and different
projects, it was too tempting to pass up. I hope I don't do that
again.''

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Film: Weir's Slight but Sweet Love Story
   ----

   The director Peter Weir has built a distinguished career
making intelligent, romantic films that enable audiences to
feel both entertained and enlightened. Though he is
Australian, films like "The Year of Living Dangerously,"
"Witness" and, certainly, "Dead Poets Society," fit within a
Hollywood tradition of entertainment as teaching tool.
   The lessons of Mr. Weir's latest film, "Green Card," are
very slight, and that lightness turns out to be the picture's
virtue. Little more than air -- and Gerard Depardieu, and the
pretty lighting on Andie MacDowell's gorgeous face -- hold
this romantic comedy together. You won't find yourself
discussing this bit of ephemera for hours, or even minutes
once it's over.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But "Green Card" is quite pleasant to watch mainly because
Mr. Weir hasn't disturbed its simple virtues with undue
portent. Sometimes a plate of spaghetti with a simple tomato
sauce is just the thing, and this is the movie equivalent of
that.
   Or perhaps I should say it's the equivalent of a simple
hamburger. Mr. Weir -- who wrote and produced as well as
directed the film -- takes great delight in vegetarian
bashing. Mr. Depardieu plays a rough sensualist who is
horrified by the sanctimonious people the woman he loves
associates with. "Get out vegetarian]" he screams at her
boyfriend. "You . . . cucumber." The burly French actor's
earthy charms are so convincing that he makes the idea of a
meal without red meat and red wine seem sinful.
   Mr. Depardieu plays George Faure, a Frenchman who wants to
emigrate to the U.S. but who doesn't have legal immigrant
status. A friend urges him to cut through the red tape by
marrying a U.S. citizen. The friend just happens to have a
woman friend who also needs a quickie marriage. She's a
horticulturist who's found an apartment with a greenhouse --
in Manhattan; however, the co-op board wants a married couple
in the place. Though they plan to separate immediately
following their marriage, suspicious immigration officials
force them to spend time together so they can prove they are
really married.
   Mr. Weir has filmed New York with the friendly warmth of
the outsider who's been charmed rather than dismayed by what
you might call the city's energy. This isn't the knowing
vision of Woody Allen, who romanticizes Manhattan with the
tenderness of a lover who has never lost his sense of that
initial enchantment. Mr. Weir's New York isn't particularly
familiar; it's just a pretty urban backdrop.
   Indeed, this isn't a picture for those who find prettiness
annoying. The first image of Ms. MacDowell shows a pretty
woman sniffing a rose. Many of the shots in the picture
seemed to have been staged simply for the purpose of creating
a tableau centering on the actress's face. Her vivid
portrayal of the repressed housewife in "sex, lies and
videotape" made a lot of people forget that she tended to
ruin her performances when she opened her mouth. In this film
her acting is once again dodgy; she frequently conveys more
with her complexion than with her characterization. Her
complexion, however, is charming.
   Mr. Depardieu, on the other hand, proves here that he is a
great actor in at least two languages. Because he has become
so identified as the contemporary French actor, it was
difficult to imagine what it would be like to hear him
speaking English. Would the nuance of his performance be
diluted by the fact that he was forced to carry on in
English? Not at all. In fact, Mr. Depardieu frequently seems
more at ease handling points of irony than Ms. MacDowell
does, and she's speaking her own language.
   Except for a small part in an obscure movie years ago, Mr.
Depardieu has never before acted in an English-language
picture. I suspect this won't be his last.
   ---
   Penelope Ann Miller is emerging as one of the freshest and
most engaging young actresses working today. At the moment
she is starring in "Awakenings" and in "Kindergarten Cop."
Her appeal is so strong that she has inspired Arnold
Schwarzenegger to appear sincere in a love scene.
   Mr. Schwarzenegger is otherwise predictable in
"Kindergarten Cop," and that is meant as a compliment. He
plays an undercover policeman who must teach kindergarten for
a while in order to catch a vicious killer. Though the film
never quite lives up to the joke of its concept -- big man
overwhelmed by small children -- it makes for an amiable
backdrop to a box of popcorn. Unfortunately, the film makers
have tacked on an ending sequence whose violence seems too
graphic for small children who would otherwise enjoy the
picture.
   Perhaps parents could use the tactic my friend Sara's mom
came up with at "Old Yeller" many years ago. She had taken a
bunch of kids to the movies to celebrate Sara's birthday. But
when she realized the picture was unspooling inexorably
toward the dog's death, she told the children the picture was
over and herded them out of the theater. For years Sara was
convinced "Old Yeller" had a happy ending and would have been
content to believe that forever.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: When I praised Mr. Depardieu for his
performance in the film "Cyrano de Bergerac," a number of
readers chastised me later for not mentioning the 1950
version of the film, starring Jose Ferrer, which is also
available on video. Fans of another contemporary film,
"Dances With Wolves," might like to compare that overlong
Kevin Costner buffalo opera with a classic film of a similar
story, "Broken Arrow." It stars James Stewart and Jeff
Chandler, and it offers many glimpses of Debra Paget in her
toothsome prime.

<LEADPARA>  JUST as European audiences once thought of Hollywood action pictures as
synonymous with Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson, Americans have come to
associate quality French films with the name Gerard Depardieu. Just roll it
off your tongue -- JAY-rard DE-par-dew -- and you feel as if you're speaking
French.;    Do a quick scroll of the great French films of the last 15 years
-- "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs," "The Return of Martin Guerre," "Danton" and
"Jean de Florette," among them -- and you're bound to come up with a Depardieu
vehicle or two. Since making his screen debut in 1965 in a short and an
unfinished adaptation of "Christmas Carol" by Agnes Varda, the actor has
appeared in, by his own estimation, "almost 80 films." And he's only 42! Not
even the old-time Hollywood greats -- the Cagneys and the Bogarts -- could
boast of such filmography.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE THINKING WOMAN'S SEX SYMBOL
FRANCE'S BURLY GERARD DEPARDIEU POISED FOR
STATESIDE STARDOM  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Depardieu -- the very personification of the bearish bohemian -- obviously
likes to work. And over the years he has sought out and been sought out by his
country's best  filmmakers, including Claude Berri, Alan Resnais, Bertrand
Blier and the late Francois Truffaut, for whom he made "The Last Metro" and
"The Woman Next Door.";    And yet, for all his notoriety, Depardieu has
remained a hero of the art-house cognoscenti. France's burly man of the street
-- part poet, part stevedore -- hasn't caught on with Mr. and Mrs. Average
Filmgoer.;    But that could change in '91.;    Depardieu is now appearing in
the thinking man's swashbuckler, "Cyrano de Bergerac," and is making his
Hollywood debut in a robust romantic comedy called "Green Card" (arriving
locally Friday). As Cyrano, he brings his energy and signature bullheadedness
to a whole new audience. There is even talk of an Oscar nomination. As George
Faure, the French composer in "Green Card" who marries a New York botanist to
get around immigration laws, he gets to speak broken English and work his
mulish charm on co-star Andie MacDowell (of "sex, lies &amp; videotape").;    Then
Depardieu is set to return in early February in the restored, five-hour
version of "1900," directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and first released in 1976.
Depardieu co-starred opposite Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland and Burt
Lancaster. (The epic celebration of Italian socialism, to be rated NC-17 in
its new form, begins a limited run at San Francisco's Castro Theater Feb. 1.);
   Liked film's simplicity;  With an occasional assist from a young
translator, the actor talked recently about his unusual work methods and the
decision to at long last "go Hollywood." He was drawn to "Green Card" because
of its simplicity and because it had been tailor-designed for him (by
director-writer Peter Weir of "Dead Poets Society"). "It's a beautiful
situation," he began, reaching for another pungent Gitane. "I like the idea of
a man who goes to New York and has to marry a woman to stay in the country. It
is simple, uncomplicated. Also, I love Peter Weir. I was very impressed that
this man who didn't know me wrote a script for me on the other side of the
planet.";    Actually, Australian Weir rewrote the script with Depardieu in
mind. The romantic comedy had been gathering dust in a bottom drawer for
several years. It wasn't until Weir saw Depardieu in "Danton" and Weir's wife
suggested a few changes (the protagonist was originally a British film buff in
Hollywood) that the project was resurrected. The character may be named George
Faure, but he's really Depardieu, right down to the provincial upbringing, the
dagger tattoo on his right forearm, the early scrapes with gendarmes and time
in reform school.;    The shady past George describes to McDowell's Bronte is
Depardieu's past.;    "I got this when I was 12 years old," the actor said,
pulling up his sleeve to reveal the dagger tattoo. "I wanted to be strong,
tough. I was angry about everything. All of my tattoos mean something. The
knife tattoo means that you were reported by someone and have sworn to have
revenge.";    Weighty issue;  There are even references to Depardieu's
considerable waistline. In the movie, a joke is made of George's refusal to
own up to his weight. Depardieu isn't as vain. "I am now 200 pounds. I weighed
250 during 'Cyrano.' I had trouble moving in the sword fights. It's the wine.
The wine opens your appetite. Now I eat steamed vegetables and a little
chicken.";    "Originally, the concept for 'Green Card' didn't work," Weir
explained later. "It was neither funny nor romantic, but labored, contrived.
When I changed the setting to New York and made the hero a Frenchman, it
started to come together. I constructed George to reflect the qualities I've
loved most in Gerard's work -- the humor, the roughness, the physicality. It
was purely and simply written for Gerard.";    Six weeks later Weir had a
script but doubted that Depardieu would be attainable. "If he hadn't made a
picture in English at age 40, I reasoned, he either didn't want to or he
didn't speak English well enough.";    Not fluent in English;  Weir discussed
the project with Depardieu by phone, then sent him the script, which was
translated and recorded on an audio cassette. They talked again.;    "I put
the phone down with clammy hands," the director recalled. "His English was
pretty bad and my French wasn't much better. But at least we could
communicate. He said he liked the fact that the character was a foreigner, not
an American, and that he would only have to speak enough English to seesaw
thorough the language.";    So they met in Paris and "sealed the deal . . . We
got on immediately," said Weir.;    Unfortunately, Depardieu's legendary
workload got in the way. Besides the upcoming "Cyrano," he had two other
feature commitments. He wouldn't be free for another 18 months. "It was a
major disappointment," Weir recalled. "I had no option but to say, 'I'll
wait.' ";    Weir went on to "Dead Poets Society" and further acclaim.
Depardieu did Blier's "Thanks, Life," Berri's "Uranus" (about the French
resistance in the last days of World War II) and "Cyrano," which was filmed in
four months in Hungary and earned Depardieu the best actor award at last
year's Cannes festival. "Cyrano," at $20 million, is the most expensive French
production to date. Typically, Depardieu was involved years before the cameras
started rolling.;    That's how he prefers it. He sees himself as packager and
creative producer as well as star.;    "I'm not just an actor," he said. "The
acting is the last part I have to do. It's a piece of cake. More exciting for
me is the development. I propose an idea and give writers the money to develop
it. Sometimes I work for years with a writer and nothing happens. I
commissioned a writer to give me a treatment of Balzac's 'Colonel Chabert.' He
went away for a year and returned with a treatment we didn't use.";   
Depardieu said he works so much because "I am -- how do you say? -- hungry at
life. I eat the life.";    And it's this near-feverish zest that comes through
in "Cyrano" and "Green Card." Depardieu's specific appeal can be chalked up to
one element -- "unpredictability, both in life and on screen," said Weir.
"That's his greatest quality. You're never certain what he might do next. . .
. There are some very funny things that aren't in the film because they tilted
the character toward the buffoonish. There was a whole thing in the shower
with Bronte's potted plants that was hysterical.";    Depardieu's biggest
laugh-getter -- wherein he literally pounds out an impromptu composition on a
grand piano -- did make it to the final cut. It's the actor at his most
roguish and resourceful.;    In Weir's mind, the rather light and predictable
"Green Card" could only have worked with two actors -- Depardieu or the
middle-aged Spencer Tracy. "But Tracy is dead and I don't know if he could
have mastered the accent.";    Depardieu shrugs off Hollywood's awe over his
immense body of work. He points to Gene Hackman, Nick Nolte and Michael Caine
as other actors who keep busy. "I don't think (the amount of work) is so
amazing," he went on. "Except for 'Cyrano' and 'Jean de Florette,' I make
small movies. It's not the same way Americans make movies. When they accept
movies they have beaucoup travail -- they work much more.";    Depardieu
doesn't have time to ponder such things. He must return to Paris to oversee
production on a farce called "Mon Pere." He plays a single father on vacation
with his precocious teen-age daughter. "It's a little comedy, but a good one .
. . a very good concept. Everyone thinks my 14-year-old daughter is my
lover.";    Depardieu thinks he's a long shot for an Oscar nomination this
year. He does note, however, that Jose Ferrer won in 1950 for his portrayal of
Cyrano de Bergerac and that version was a lot less popular than the new French
adaptation. "That was very stagy, claustrophobic . . . the audience was not
into classics then. In mine, I didn't wear the long, exaggerated nose because
I didn't want to be a caricature. Ours is closer to a romantic epic, like
Hollywood makes.";    Weir is more optimistic about Depardieu's chances. "I
think he'll be nominated for 'Cyrano,' but 'Green Card' will keep the
spotlight on him. Each movie will stimulate the other. 'Cyrano' is the grander
work; it's an Academy film.";    Even if the Academy does smile on the
foreigner (no actor in a foreign-language film has ever won in the best-actor
category), don't expect him to file for a green card work permit. "Maybe if I
were more fluent in English. For now I think I will just visit when I see
something I really want to do."  </TEXT>

   HOLLYWOOD -- What Pele was to soccer, Gerard Depardieu is
to movies. In much of the world, particularly in Western
Europe, he is acclaimed as the greatest living screen actor,
a French Brando, a legend.
   But in the U.S., people ask "Who?"

<TEXT>
   Moreover, as Walt Disney Co. film executives found when
testing brief TV ads with audiences, many Americans' initial
impression of the shaggy, beefy, big-nosed actor was that he
was a "fat slob."
   The female lead in the coming film "Green Card" has the
same reaction, but after a while she falls madly in love.
Disney's vaunted marketing machine must ensure that audiences
do the same.
   But first, they have to get people to show up. The main
thing people ask when they hear that a film is a love story
is "Who's in it?" But the movie's co-star, Andie MacDowell of
"sex, lies, and videotape," is also relatively unknown.
   The subject matter of this small-scale romantic comedy
won't help sell it either, even if the idea is easy to sum up
on a poster: "The story of two people who got married, met,
and then fell in love." Hollywood generally loves concepts
that can be explained in a sentence: Two strangers, a scruffy
Frenchman and a slightly priggish American horticulturist,
get married, he to gain residency status, she to get an
apartment she covets. But however packageable the idea seems,
it doesn't hold any special allure.
   "It's outside most people's experience," concedes Peter
Weir, who wrote, produced and directed "Green Card."
   The marketing difficulties are especially frustrating
because Disney executives are proud of the film. Disney
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg has taken it as a
personal challenge to successfully open the movie, which some
Disney wags are calling "`Pretty Woman' for people who
think." The poster for "Green Card" bears more than a passing
resemblance to the one used for "Pretty Woman," Disney's
biggest hit ever.
   Christmas is a crowded, competitive time, especially for
fragile movies, but "Green Card" is being released Sunday to
qualify it for Academy Award consideration. Most reviews
aren't out yet, but they're likely to be generally favorable.
Rolling Stone called it "captivating" but with "all the heft
of a potato chip." Mr. Weir, the Australian director who made
"The Year of Living Dangerously" and "Witness," is highly
regarded. Disney gets prestige points no matter what, but a
success would help redeem a winter season when Disney's
"Three Men and a Little Lady" and "Rescuers Down Under" were
snowed under by Fox's "Home Alone."
   It would surpass Disney executives' wildest dreams if the
film won the kind of audience attracted by other urban fare
like "Moonstruck" and "When Harry Met Sally." But the
marketing of the film is a slow and arduous process; it's
definitely not just a matter of buying the right TV time. Mr.
Katzenberg has criss-crossed the country to be the host at
upscale screenings followed by receptions at New York's 21
Club, Hollywood's Morton's and the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.
   This is an effort to reach "opinionmakers," says Disney
marketing chief Robert Levin. Through word-of-mouth, he hopes
the film will do well in New York and Los Angeles, then build
gradually as it goes to a still-selective 100 screens Jan 11.
If any kind of buzz continues and if other Christmas movies
wither, Disney hopes theater owners will make room for "Green
Card" on more and more screens.
   Disney is walking a tightrope. It needs Mr. Depardieu's
tiny art-house following to help launch the picture, but if
the film is perceived as too arty, it could turn off wider
segments of the audience.
   "When someone is confronted with a piece of material, they
can say, `I get it, but I think you have to be smart,'" says
Mr. Levin. "They're afraid that they're going to wind up in
the audience and not get the joke when everyone else does."
   So the TV spots and theatrical trailer rather mundanely
explain the idea and show a little romance and comedy. Mr.
Levin says the only reason the trailer even mentions that Mr.
Depardieu is "the most acclaimed actor in France" is so the
handful of people who know this will be reassured that Disney
is aware of it. "The rest of the people will say, `Big
deal.'"
   Disney hasn't been too proud to try some Hollywood
gimmicks, but they, too, have been problematic. The marketing
people placed classified ads seeking couples who got married
so one partner could get a green card to stay in the U.S.,
thinking they would be fodder for talk shows that would also
mention the film. "But it appears only to have generated the
interest of the INS," says Mr. Levin. As in the film, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't care if the
couple are in love and want to live happily ever after; the
initial act is still fraud.
   Mr. Weir thought up the movie's premise three years ago
after returning to Australia to take a year off, licking his
wounds from the disappointing opening of "The Mosquito
Coast." He wound up writing the script with Mr. Depardieu in
mind, even though he had never met him and didn't know
whether Mr. Depardieu could speak English. (He can, sort of.)
   Disney has an aggressively hands-on attitude about its
films and generally steers clear of renowned directors for
this reason, but Mr. Weir and Mr. Katzenberg, who did "Dead
Poets Society" together, get along well. Although Mr. Weir
says Disney shows "excessive zeal" about enforcing budgetary
constraints and can be "bureaucratic," he was left alone on
"Green Card" because the $12 million film was independently
produced. Mr. Depardieu and Mr. Weir accepted reduced fees to
meet the budget, nothing new for the French actor who once
starred in a movie for a struggling director in return for a
bottle of wine. (He did stipulate that it be a very good
bottle.)
   Disney executives seemed resigned to allowing Mr. Weir to
make the film his way. They couldn't get him to cast a bigger
name than Ms. MacDowell or to broaden the comedy elements.
They didn't push too hard about Mr. Weir's refusal to give
the film a "Pretty Woman" fairy-tale ending. They would just
say, "Don't you realize that if you recut this, you could buy
a new house?" Mr. Weir recalls.
   But now Mr. Weir needs Disney to get people into theaters,
and the director sees some irony in this. The movie industry,
he says, "has trained audiences to respond to a siren song:
`Come and get it, you'll like it,' and it's turned into a
Frankenstein monster. They release all these dumb movies, and
then when they have one they like -- one everybody likes,
that's simple and honest -- it turns out to be difficult to
sell."

   ``The Long Walk Home'' (New Visions Pictures)
   
   Like ``Mississippi Burning'' in 1988, ``The Long Walk Home'' has
been assailed by some black leaders as being a distortion of the
struggle for civil rights in the South. Both films are told from
the white point of view, though ``The Long Walk Home'' appears to
offer more balance between the races.
   Taken on its artistic merits alone, ``The Long Walk Home'' is an
earnest, often affecting, curiously anticlimactic film. Its major
assets are two fully realized performances by accomplished
actresses, Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg.
   The setting of John Cork's script is Montgomery, Ala., in 1955,
when municipal buses were segregated and blacks were forced to sit
in the back. A seamstress named Rosa Parks decided one day that she
was too tired and took a seat at the front of the bus. She was
arrested, and Montgomery blacks staged a one-day boycott that grew
into a movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. Buses were integrated
a year later following a federal court order.
   In ``The Long Walk Home,'' nothing has changed in the social
structure of Montgomery since the institution of Jim Crow laws
following the Civil War and Reconstruction.
   The back-of-the-bus mentality prevails among the city's white
leaders, and the blacks are expected to know their place. The
decades of degradation well up, and blacks call a strike on the
municipal bus system, a prime source of revenue.
   Enter two reluctant heroines.
   Miriam Thompson (Spacek) is a well-to-do matron who accedes to
the wishes of her good ol' boy husband (Dwight Schultz). Odessa
Cotter (Goldberg) is her dutiful domestic, a woman who has never
challenged the social system.
   But Odessa believes the bus strike is the right thing to do. She
is willing to walk the nine long miles to and from work. Mrs.
Thompson sympathizes with Odessa and is increasingly appalled by
how her husband is influenced by his racist brother (Dylan Baker).
   The strike escalates into violence, and King's house is bombed.
Miriam Thompson decides to drive Odessa to work. Her act brings a
climax in her marriage and in the community.
   Inexpensively but caringly produced by Howard W. Koch Jr. and
Dave Bell, ``The Long Walk Home'' carries an emotional impact.
Spacek deftly portrays the ethical dilemma of Southern wife and
mother. In her most restrained performance, Goldberg again
impresses as one of the best actresses around. The other
performances are first-rate, especially Schultz as the husband who
is incensed to find his values questioned.
   Richard Pearce directs with a firm touch on the personal scenes,
which could have been overwrought. Only in the climax does he
stumble, reducing the issues to a simplistic level and mishandling
crowd scenes.
   The Miramax Films release of a New Visions Picture is rated PG
for language and intensity. Running time: 97 minutes.

   ``Green Card'' (Touchstone)
   
   ``Green Card'' is a wisp of a movie, a harmless puff of smoke
that's pleasing to watch and quickly forgotten.
   Gerard Depardieu stars as Georges, an illegal alien from France
who marries a stranger, Bronte (Andie MacDowell), so he can receive
a green card and live in Manhattan. Bronte has her own reasons for
marrying. A horticulturist, she wants to purchase an apartment with
a greenhouse and reasons that having another name on the lease will
persuade the co-op board to let her in.
   It works, at first, but when immigration officials become
suspicious, Georges and Bronte are forced to live together so they
can learn as much as possible about each other and present
themselves as a true couple.
   Georges, with shaggy hair and black, baggy pants, is earthy and
loveable. He smokes, he eats fatty food, he loses his temper, he
hates instant coffee. He's charming, but also cynical: he ran away
from home as a child and spent a brief time in jail (Depardieu had
the same experiences in his own life).
   Bronte, who favors green, baggy pants, is well-to-do and
idealistic. She is passionate about the environment, and especially
about her garden. She's very clean and a little repressed, not
unlike her character in ``sex, lies and videotape.'' ``I am like a
gutter, and you are like a plant!'' Georges shouts at her at one
point.
   This is the comedy of the mismatch, a reworking of ``It Happened
One Night,'' ``Woman of the Year,'' ``The Goodbye Girl'' and many
others, when opposites are thrown together and eventually attract.
   Director Peter Weir takes a low-key approach, applying the same
thoughtful style of last year's ``Dead Poets Society,'' offering
quiet shots of MacDowell watching the rain and presenting a
Manhattan so golden you'd think the lens was dipped in corn oil.
Weir also wrote and produced the film.
   ``Green Card'' is a time-killer for Depardieu, who likes to make
three or four movies a year and can currently be seen in the far
more demanding ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   But the French actor, in his first predominantly
English-speaking role, does get the most out of a slim part,
showing wonderful timing and giving the film a sweet, offbeat
quality. The scenes in which Georges and Bronte concoct love
letters and put together an album of phony wedding and honeymoon
pictures are especially funny, such as when Georges pretends he's
writing from Africa and complains the elephants are keeping him
awake.
   The film wants to be liked - and succeeds - but the touch is so
light it leaves no mark. Even as Georges faces deportation, there
is no real tension in ``Green Card,'' no demands made of the
audience, nothing to think about when it's over, a sweet dream that
fades away after the lights go on.
   The Touchstone Pictures Release is rated PG-13. Running Time:
108 minutes.

FRANCE'S WORKING-CLASS HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems like only yesterday that Gerard Depardieu was the enfant terrible of 
French film, startling filmgoers with his portrayal of an amoral delinquent in 
"Going Places," Bertrand Blier's outrageous 1974 sex comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Nibbling on pasta at a cozy Hollywood eatery, Depardieu is grumpily bemoaning 
the new generation of lazy, empty-headed French actors. "The young French 
actors are total egomaniacs," he growls in halting English. "These acting 
schools they go to -- all they do is turn them inward, not outward." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for an appropriately scathing image, Depardieu abruptly switches to 
his native tongue. "They've become so self-absorbed," he says in torrid French 
through an interpreter. "In my time, we read the classics. Moliere. 
Shakespeare. Anything we could get our hands on. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you ask a French actor to recite from Racine, they wouldn't know what 
to do. All they know is Stanislavsky. When I started out 20 years ago, the 
great actors all had a strong theater background. But the young actors today 
only think about film." 
</P>
<P>
He frowns, running a meaty hand through his long mane of hair. "Now our actors 
do one or two movies and -- voila -- they're stars. They want everything 
without doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I get letters all the time from parents saying, 'My son loves the acting 
profession.' " 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu flashes a triumphant smile. "So I reply, 'That's wonderful, but does 
the acting craft love him?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that the camera loves Depardieu. At 41, he is the working-class 
hero of French cinema, as honored and beloved as Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Yves 
Montand or any other titans of past eras. It's perhaps a sign of his screen 
magnetism that when Peter Weir needed a burst of inspiration to finish his 
script for "Green Card," he simply put a photo of Depardieu on display at his 
desk as he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Though Depardieu made his mark with Blier's raffish satires, the bulky actor 
has played everything from a 16th-Century wanderer in "The Return of Martin 
Guerre" to a baffled modern-day husband in "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine many actors who have ranged so far and wide in the cinema. 
Depardieu was Danton in Andrzej Wajda's compelling account of the French 
Revolution and Rodin in Bruno Nuytten's "Camille Claudel." He also picked up 
best-actor prizes in such films as "The Last Metro" (his only movie with 
Francois Truffaut) and Maurice Pialat's "Police." 
</P>
<P>
American audiences will soon be seeing Depardieu in two of his most formidable 
challenges. He opens Tuesday as the eloquent swordsman hero of "Cyrano de 
Bergerac," which won him the best-actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. On 
Sunday, he opens in "Green Card," Weir's romantic comedy, which features 
Depardieu in his first major English-language film as a Frenchman who engineers 
a marriage of convenience so he can move to America. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, language was just as much a barrier making "Cyrano" as it was 
in "Green Card." The film, adapted from Edmond Rostand's classic play, was shot 
on location in both Hungary and France, using 2,000 actors and extras. Most of 
the extras were Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it very difficult to coordinate everyone's movements during the big 
crowd scenes," he explains. "Since the extras didn't speak French, they didn't 
always know where I was going next. They all look very impressed by my 
speeches, but most of them didn't understand a word I was saying!" 
</P>
<P>
Since the film's dialogue is delivered in Alexandrine verse, which contains 12 
syllables in each line (English verse is commonly 10-syllable iambic 
pentameter), Depardieu found himself choreographing sweeping physical movements 
and sword play to fit the extended lines of verse. 
</P>
<P>
"We rehearsed the film like we would a play," says Depardieu, who spent an hour 
each day having his already ample nose enlarged for the part. "We all sat 
around a table for two weeks and practiced, so we could visualize how it would 
work." 
</P>
<P>
With 60 films to his credit in less than 20 years, Depardieu is an actor who 
seems obsessed with keeping busy. A chunky man with a torso that looks like it 
could support a freeway overpass, he says he enjoys carousing at night -- but 
insists he's always ready for work every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu jokes that the only time he has free time is when he's making a 
movie. "I know it sounds strange, but I like a strict schedule. That's when I 
really feel free." 
</P>
<P>
He's certainly not enthusiastic about doing in-depth interviews to promote his 
films. Out with a reporter on a brief visit here, Depardieu only allows an 
occasional glimpse of the playfulness he displays on movie sets. (He does joke 
about Warren Beatty's legendary sexual exploits, but quickly adds that the jest 
was "in parentheses," apparently a rough translation for off-the-record.) 
</P>
<P>
He apologizes about missing a previous interview, saying he had been worn out 
from a long day of media encounters. "I was exhausted," he says. "And probably 
drunk too." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, accompanied by a pretty young girlfriend who was flying with 
him to Australia, he sticks to mineral water. "It's great for jet lag," he 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently peeved about a recent Interview feature that he says misquoted him 
as bad-mouthing Robert De Niro ("that's so untrue -- he is a hero to me!"), 
Depardieu is all business. An hour into his interview, he becomes bored and 
restless, signaling an end to the chat by abruptly heading off to his 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu may find his publicity labors trying, but it was a series of 
interviews he did in Australia several years ago that got him his part in 
"Green Card." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been writing a romantic comedy about an Englishman who comes to America 
and has to get a green card," explains Peter Weir in a separate interview. "And 
when it wasn't going very well, my wife suggested that I use Gerard as the 
model for the character. So, almost completely on a whim, I wrote the entire 
movie for him. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got started, Gerard came to Sydney for a film festival. I thought of 
calling him up, but I was afraid he might say no. So instead, I took a picture 
of him that ran with an interview he gave in the local paper and kept it on my 
desk as I wrote." 
</P>
<P>
Too nervous to simply send Depardieu's agent the completed script, Weir got on 
a plane, flew to Paris and spent a weekend with the actor at his country house. 
Weir says that the two men took long walks in the fields surrounding 
Depardieu's home, getting to know each other. The fact that Weir speaks French 
with as little confidence as Depardieu handles English was hardly an impediment 
once the creative juices began flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a real rapport from the start," Weir says. "When we had trouble finding 
the right words to explain something, we simply pooled our two languages and 
made them one. We were never embarrassed to use whichever language expressed 
what we were trying to say." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu prefers to work with strong-minded directors who can provide him with 
rich, provocative material. His favorite remains longtime collaborator Blier, 
with whom he has made four films, including "Going Places," "Menage" and "Too 
Beautiful for You." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu was born in a small town in central France that had a nearby U.S. Air 
Force base. Fascinated by American culture, Depardieu went to see rock 'n' roll 
movies, stole blue jeans from laundry lines and hung out at the local train 
station, perfecting his James Dean impression. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young I loved James Dean and Marlon Brando," he recalls. "But I 
liked so many American stars -- Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum, Alan Ladd." He 
grins mischievously. "Even Victor Mature!" 
</P>
<P>
He insists he was extremely shy as a teen-ager. In fact, he believes his 
youthful timidity served him well as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many great actors who stuttered in real life, but once they 
were on stage, they were completely relaxed," he says. "Certain kinds of 
obstacles can be assets, not just defects. There is something in the art of 
acting that transforms these difficulties into strengths and beauties." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu taps his fork on the table. "If you are only macho, like some actors 
you see today, you can't ever be shy. But if you are shy, you can still act 
macho. I am not afraid to show my feminine side -- it's part of what makes me a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
He waves the fork in the air. "Our society wants us to be men with (guts). But 
the greatest thing you can have as a man is to have the (guts) -- and the 
vulnerability too." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of success and celebrity bores him. "Who knows what success is anyway," he 
says. "I'm not a sportsman, trying to better my record. I try to make good 
movies, regardless of whether they make money or not. A good flop is better 
than two ordinary hits anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But are actors held in high regard in France, at least when compared to other 
artists? "The most respected artists are writers," Depardieu concludes after a 
thoughtful silence. "Then come the composers and musicians. After that, the 
film directors. The only actors who really matter are the ones who come along 
and release creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu throws his hands into the air, mimicking a bomb blast. "They are the 
detonators. They inspire writers to release a blast of creative energy, which 
can make great movies." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu is, of course, too modest to describe himself as such a detonator. 
But hearing him detail his relationship with Blier, it seems that he relishes 
just such a role. 
</P>
<P>
"We make movies together, the way Scorsese does with De Niro," he says. "I 
don't like to just take a script and say, 'OK, I'll do it.' Blier and I are so 
close that he doesn't even have to explain anymore. We know what each other is 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Could Depardieu ever reach such instinctive harmony with Weir (who hopes to do 
another film with him) or an American filmmaker? "I hope so," he says. "But 
when it comes to American movies, I have a long way to go, not just because I 
don't understand the language, but because I need to understand the spirit of 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
"But what makes film so beautiful is that it helps you discover so much about 
different cultures. If you see a Bunuel film, you learn about the Spanish and 
their problems with God. If you see a French film, you understand we have our 
problems with sex." 
</P>
<P>
And what has Depardieu discerned about Hollywood films and their vision of 
Americans? "Ah," he says with mock gravity. "You Americans. Your trouble is 
with guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Guilt but not sex? "Oh yes, sex too," he says with a laugh. "But only because 
it makes you feel so guilty!"

   Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Phil
Alden Robinson, Oliver Stone and Peter Weir are the Directors Guild
of America's nominees for 1989 directorial achievement.
   Allen was nominated for ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' Reiner for
``When Harry Met Sally ... ,'' Robinson for ``Field of Dreams,''
Stone for ``Born of the Fourth of July'' and Weir for ``Dead Poets
Society.''
   ``I'm just stunned,'' said Robinson, a first-time nominee. ``I
didn't think I stood a chance.''
   ``I think we have some interesting choices this year,''
commented Barry Levinson, last year's winner for ``Rain Man,'' as
he announced the nominees Tuesday.
   Reiner, Robinson and Weir were somewhat surprising choices,
since several critics have overlooked their achievements in favor
of such films as Paul Mazursky's ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' Edward
Zwick's ``Glory,'' Bruce Beresford's ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and
Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Said Robinson: ``Bruce Beresford deserved a nomination. I'm
surprised Ed Zwick didn't get a nomination. And a lot of people
were pulling for Paul Mazursky.''
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is an alternately funny and haunting
story of infidelity, starring Allen, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is perhaps the lightest movie in
competition, a romantic comedy with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as
best friends who become lovers.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' set in an Iowa corn field, features Kevin
Costner as a baseball fan who recaptures the past by building a
ballpark on his farm. ``Born on the Fourth of July'' is Stone's
account of the life of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), a
patriotic soldier whose life is shattered in Vietnam.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' casts Robin Williams as an unconventional
teacher working within the confines of a conventional boys boarding
school.
   The guild says its awards have deviated from the Academy Awards
only three times since 1949.
   Three years ago, Steven Spielberg won the DGA award for ``The
Color Purple,'' but Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
members didn't nominate him for an Oscar. The directing Oscar that
year went to Sydney Pollack for ``Out of Africa.''
   Some observers believe the guild's 9,000 members, all of whom
have a vote, represent a more divergent electorate than the Academy.
   Four of the 1989 nominees have been up for the DGA award before.
Allen was nominated for ``Annie Hall'' (1977), ``Manhattan'' (1979)
and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986); Reiner for ``Stand By Me''
(1986); Stone for ``Platoon'' (He won in 1986); and Weir for
``Witness'' (1985).
   The awards will be presented at the DGA's 42nd annual dinner, to
be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles on March 10.

CRITIC AT LARGE: DEPARDIEU: A FRENCHMAN'S PASSION FOR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerard Depardieu had finished "Cyrano de Bergerac" in Paris at 5 the previous 
afternoon and hopped a plane to Manhattan, where his film "Too Beautiful for 
You" was the opening-night attraction at the New York Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
He was still wearing the long hair and a mustache grown for Cyrano, just in 
case retakes would be needed. Lumberjack-large and in a smock-like black shirt 
and black trousers, he suggested Rodin's sculpture of Balzac more than Rodin, 
whom he plays in "Camille Claudel," which opens Dec. 22 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In "Too Beautiful for You," which will be released here in February, Depardieu 
plays a car dealer torn between his love for his exquisitely beautiful wife and 
a plain, frumpy but passionately devoted mistress. It is a reordering of the 
classic triangle, with sharp and wounding corners however it's turned. 
</P>
<P>
The film is also his fifth with writer-director Bertrand Blier. Their first 
collaboration, "Going Places" ("Les Valseuses") in 1974, established Depardieu 
as a star. He and the late Patrick Dewaere played a pair of layabouts who meet 
up, with fateful consequences, with Jeanne Moreau. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young, unconscious and very dangerous," Depardieu said in his hotel 
suite the afternoon after the festival opening. "My father saw the film and 
said, 'Ah, yes, that's Gerard all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu spoke through a translator, with tentative bursts of English. He will 
make his second film in English in New York and Los Angeles starting in 
February. It is "The Green Card," which director Peter Weir ("Dead Poets 
Society") wrote especially for Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
His first venture in English, "I Want to Go Home," directed by Alain Resnais 
from a script by Jules Feiffer, was a success at the Venice Film Festival 
earlier this year. In it, lyricist Adolph Green plays a temporarily expatriate 
cartoonist, Depardieu a Flaubert scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu somewhat resembles Michael Caine in his apparently compulsive drive 
to work constantly, but money does not seem to be the immediate object. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I make a film for two bottles of good wine," he says. "I made three 
films without being paid at all, and none is a success. I make no money yet 
from 'Too Beautiful for You.' But," he explains with a devastating smile, "I 
have a sympathetic banker." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he produces or co-produces all his own films now. "Truffaut told me 
how to get more involved," Depardieu says. "It's better not to get paid a lot. 
I don't want to have to make movies just to pay taxes." He admits he is in the 
60% bracket. "Anyway, it stifles interesting projects to ask for a lot of money 
at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
But even so, no benefits will be required for him. A few years ago, he bought a 
castle, with vineyards, in Anjou. Joan of Arc is said to have slept there. 
</P>
<P>
"The '89 vintage is very good, great," Depardieu says. He loves the land and 
watching the vines and, occasionally, he adds, he feels some of the resonances 
of "Jean de Florette," one of the films in which he achieved a great critical 
success and in which feelings about land was a central theme. 
</P>
<P>
If he hints of Caine in his constant employment, Depardieu also has a parallel 
with Steve McQueen as a man whose early teen-age years could have as easily led 
him to jail as to fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in the small city of Chateauroux in central France, with an American 
air base just outside town. "I saw rock 'n' roll movies. It was a big taste of 
American culture." He fell in love with blue jeans and T-shirts and kept 
himself supplied, he says, by stealing them from laundry lines. He admits that 
he was a juvenile delinquent in training. 
</P>
<P>
He also saw his first blacks -- GIs who were, he says, "received like gods" 
because of their unfamiliarity. He had a casual black girlfriend and was 
kissing her when a French friend angrily told him off. "It was my first 
experience with racism," Depardieu says, "so of course I kept on kissing her, 
as my personal blow against racism." 
</P>
<P>
He and his pals hung out at the train station, watching with envy as people 
left for the mysterious glamour of Paris. One pal who was studying acting in 
Paris came home on a visit and it did not take much urging to persuade 
Depardieu to come back with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easier to leave home then," Depardieu explains. He was 15. He joined a 
workshop and his life and education began again. At 16, already working in 
theater, he met Elizabeth Guignot, who became his wife and still is. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered immediately that I am never afraid on stage. I am nervous in 
sports, but I am at peace on the stage." With his first money, he bought an 
alarm clock and a book. "I learned again how to read, to decipher tragedy, to 
understand things I didn't really understand." 
</P>
<P>
Not yet 17, he made his first film, a small documentary by Roger Lennart, "the 
patron of my new life," about Socrates as the first beatnik. He started 
"Christmas Carol" with Agnes Varda but it was never finished. ("People started 
living and stopped shooting," he says cryptically.) 
</P>
<P>
On stage, he did David Storey's "Home" and was offered a role in the Paris 
production of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" but turned it down because he 
thought the translation failed to do justice to the material. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first feature at 22 in 1970 and has hardly paused since. He 
appeared in Marguerite Duras' "Nathalie Granger" in 1972 and in 1974 the 
significant "Going Places," which his aura of smoldering danger helped make an 
international success. 
</P>
<P>
The work since is an anthology of the best contemporary French and European 
cinema: Blier's "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs," Resnais' "My Uncle in America," 
Truffaut's "The Last Metro," Daniel Vigne's "The Return of Martin Guerre," 
Andrzej Wajda's "Danton," Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900," Maurice Pialat's "Under 
the Sign of Satan" (best film at the 1987 Cannes festival) and Claude Berri's 
"Jean de Florette." It is a partial list. 
</P>
<P>
Blier's "Too Beautiful for You" is frequently funny and just as frequently 
baffling, not least to Depardieu. "After seven weeks of shooting, I said, 'I 
don't know what we're doing.' Blier and I were pacing around a courtyard and he 
looked pale and terrible. He said it was the food we had yesterday. I said, 
'No, it's the film.' " 
</P>
<P>
In "Camille Claudel," which was directed by veteran cinematographer Bruno 
Nuytten, Depardieu's Rodin is inevitably overshadowed by Isabelle Adjani's 
extraordinary performance as the young protegee (sister of the poet Paul 
Claudel) who went mad for the lost love of him. But his Rodin -- imperious, 
self-centered, driven, leaning close to models and materials because of acute 
myopia, pushing and tugging to arrange the masses he could see in the mind's 
eye -- is a remarkable characterization. In an actor's magical mathematics, it 
is all Rodin, and all Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
"I like playing historic personages," he says. "I learn more of my own 
history." Contemplating Rodin, he confesses, "The one trap I've fallen into is 
playing characters who are a little bit cowardly. I've made a true career of 
masochism."

DGA NOMINATIONS FURTHER MUDDLE OSCAR RACE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTORS GUILD REMEMBERS SPRING/SUMMER FILMS FOR ITS TOP AWARD BUT 
FORGETS SPIKE LEE AND PAUL MAZURSKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ad line that Universal Pictures has been using in its Oscar campaign for 
Phil Alden Robinson's "Field of Dreams," a fantasy baseball-theme picture 
released last spring, is "Remember the feeling." Enough members of the 
Directors Guild of America remembered to give Robinson the feeling of being a 
nominee for the DGA's 1989 best-director award. 
</P>
<P>
Enough members also remembered "Dead Poets Society" and "When Harry Met Sally," 
two early summer releases, to put their directors -- Peter Weir and Rob Reiner 
-- on a list that also included previous DGA winners Woody Allen ("Crimes and 
Misdemeanors") and Oliver Stone ("Born on the Fourth of July"). 
</P>
<P>
Weir was a previous DGA nominee in 1985 for "Witness." Reiner was nominated for 
the 1986 "Stand By Me." Allen won the award in 1977 for "Annie Hall" and was a 
subsequent nominee for both "Manhattan" in 1979 and "Hannah and Her Sisters" in 
1986. Stone won in 1987 for "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
The DGA, the bulk of whose 9,000 members are not feature-film directors, has 
had a spotty record of presaging the full list of nominations made by the 
directors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But it has 
been nearly perfect in aligning its winner with the eventual Oscar winner. Only 
three times in the 41-year history of the DGA awards has the guild's winner not 
gone on to win the Academy Award as well. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, veteran Oscar watchers have been calling this one of the most 
wide-open races in years, and Tuesday's announcement, made by 1988 winner Barry 
Levinson ("Rain Man"), did little to put it into focus. Previously honored 
directors Spike Lee (winner of the L.A. critics' best-director award for "Do 
the Right Thing"), Paul Mazursky (the New York winner for "Enemies, a Love 
Story"), Kenneth Branagh (the National Board of Review's pick for "Henry V"), 
and Gus Van Sant ("Drugstore Cowboy," selected by the National Society of Film 
Critics) were all left off the DGA list. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other directors of well-reviewed films who were overlooked by the 
DGA ("Driving Miss Daisy's" Bruce Beresford, "The War of the Roses" ' Danny 
DeVito, "Glory's" Ed Zwick, "sex, lies, and videotape's" Steven Soderbergh, 
"Music Box's" Costa-Gavras) are still in the running for Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
Of this year's DGA slate, only Oliver Stone seems certain to be among the 
academy's best-director nominees. Oscar nominations will be announced Feb. 14; 
balloting closes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the DGA nominations underscore the changing release patterns 
of major studios and undermine the conventional wisdom that films released 
before the fall are forgotten by winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams," the story of a corn farmer who builds a baseball field for 
his father's post-World War I idols, then watches the flanneled ghosts play 
ball, opened in March, a month that had traditionally been better for teen-age 
high-jinks movies than for those aimed at adults. It played all the way through 
the most competitive summer in history and grossed more than $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
The movie seemed to strike a nerve with audiences, especially men tweaked by 
memories of their own relationships with their fathers, and enjoyed the kind of 
word-of-mouth that made such films as "Chariots of Fire" and "Peggy Sue Got 
Married" easy to remember at awards time. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" fits the same mold. The movie, about a free-spirited 
English teacher at a conservative prep school, was a risky summer entry by 
Disney's Touchstone division but easily held its own and has grossed more than 
$94 million. The DGA nomination bodes well for both Weir and the film's star, 
Robin Williams, in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally," a romantic comedy about a couple who seem 
to prove the notion that friendships between men and women are sooner or later 
subverted by sexual attraction, was an instant box-office hit, propelled by the 
most talked-about scene of the year (Meg Ryan's faked orgasm in Katz Deli) and 
has taken in $92 million. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" divided critics and audiences but found 
enough fans within the DGA. A funny-sad meditation on the relativity of sin in 
God's eyes, it has faced the usual resistance from moviegoers to Allen films -- 
particularly those that veer into the epistemological zone. "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" has grossed just $17 million and was pretty much ignored by 
critics groups. 
</P>
<P>
Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July," adapted from the autobiography of Vietnam 
veteran Ron Kovic, is on a roll at the box office (it grossed more than $30 
million during its first month in release) and seems the odds-on favorite to 
dominate the Oscars. Stone is that rare film maker who, in one of Hollywood's 
most timid eras, has managed to both make films with heavy social themes and 
turn studio executives lightheaded with their box-office success. 
</P>
<P>
The DGA's nominations figure to be more populist than the academy, which in 
turn figures to be more populist than critics. There are 270 feature-film 
directors in the academy's directors branch, while the DGA membership includes 
directors of film and TV dramas and their assistants, directors of TV news and 
sports programs, unit production managers and stage production managers. 
</P>
<P>
The DGA will announce its nominees in TV categories next week. All 9,000 
members vote on the final ballot and the winners will be announced by Levinson 
at the guild's annual dinner March 10 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly 
Hills.

and Rainey.;    "For some reason I feel energized by having two kids and a
career," she says, with the slightest hint of a Southern drawl. (MacDowell is
a native of Gaffney, S.C.);    "I feel like the more I have to do, the more
energy I have. I know it sounds like it would be overwhelming and it is, but
I'm not alone, because I have a very strong, sweet husband.;    "Paul's been
'Mr. Mom' practically all year. He's traveled with me and the kids," she
says.;    The couple met when both were on a modeling shoot for the Gap.;   
"It was so romantic," MacDowell says. "(The ad) was (shot) on an old set where
they've shot some Western movies.";    Unlike a lot of models, MacDowell was
reluctant to become an actress, although she had always been interested in
acting.;    "It seemed like there was no hope. I felt like models were already
defeated before they started. Not only in society, but in business, too. I
just thought if I could get a modeling contract -- this was before L'Oreal --
that would be the ideal for me.";    'Me, Jane?' 'No, me Jane'; As fate had
it, director Hugh Hudson saw pictures of MacDowell in British Vogue and called
the editor to say he was interested in her for the role of Jane in "Greystoke:
The Legend of Tarzan" (1984).;    MacDowell was delighted to be in a Tarzan
movie.;    "(As a child) I remember every Sunday going to eat over at my
grandmother's house and after lunch my dad would want to take a nap. He would
want to watch football, but he was very sweet and he would always let me watch
'Tarzan.' So I had fond memories of Tarzan," she says.;    Unfortunately,
MacDowell says a combination of bad reviews of the film and the fact that her
own Southern voice was dubbed over by Glenn Close caused "huge problems" for
her.;    "I already had being a model held against me. It's funny how success
in modeling can both help and hurt you," she says.;    After the "Greystoke"
debacle, MacDowell's only other acting job was in the hit film "St. Elmo's
Fire" (1985) in which she played the object of Emilio Estevez's adoration.;   
Strait-laced stereotypes;  "After that there was nothing I was interested in
doing," she says. Until the innovative "sex, lies and videotape" (1989) came
along. MacDowell played a sexually repressed young wife in that film.;    Now,
in "Green Card," she plays an emotionally repressed horticulturist who agrees
to marry a French immigrant (Depardieu) so he can get the much-desired green
card entitling him to legal residency in the United States -- and she can get
the marriage license crucial to obtaining a wonderful apartment available only
to a married couple.;    "She's so internal, she's built a wall around
herself," MacDowell says of her character, Bronte Parrish.;    "Instead of
being able to love anybody else, she is so closed off, a recluse almost, she
just puts all her love into her plants.";    As a result of playing these two
repressed characters, MacDowell says, "I feel I should run out and show the
world I'm not like that. I'm not deeply moody or whatever. And after 'sex,
lies and videotape,' I felt I had to keep telling people I have no problem
having orgasms.;    "But I do understand that kind of woman. I grew up in the
South and there is so much repression in Southern women.";    MacDowell's two
upcoming films have her playing more upbeat women. In "Object of Beauty," she
and Malkovich play two very rich Americans.;    When they lose their money,
only her small Henry Moore sculpture stands between them and poverty -- until
it's stolen. The chase to find it ensues.;    "(My character in this movie) is
not really likable in a way," MacDowell says. "But in the end she is sort of
likable, a bit wild.";    Crooks and capers; In "Hudson Hawk" she plays "a hip
nun -- there's a difference between a nun and a hip nun," she says. "This one
wears sunglasses. And she works for the Vatican, protecting priceless art
treasures, including Leonardo Da Vinci's gold-making machine.;    "Bruce
(Willis) is a famous cat burglar who has just been released from prison. He
wants to go straight, but he's forced to try to steal the machine.";   
MacDowell never finished college. She says she dropped out to become a model
because "I had too much energy for school. I couldn't sit still. I feel I've
really gotten my education by traveling and by experiencing things.;    "I had
only been to five states before I went to Paris to model and I lived there for
18 months and then I went all over the world. So it was a great education.;   
"And when you make a lot of money you have to do something with it, so you
learn about business," she says.;    Motherhood has made MacDowell seriously
appraise her own behavior.;    "You have to be something your children can be
proud of, which can make you grow up a lot," she says. "I've gone through a
lot of searching ever since I had children.";    And success, she says, has
given her a real sense of security.;    "It's a nice feeling," she says. "I
used to be very shy, so now I feel a lot better about myself.;    "Growing up,
I always thought I had to live up to what other people thought of me. Being
myself is so much easier," she says.;    "Right now I just love life!"  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Glenn Lovell reviews films on a scale of no stars to 4.; Alice.  Woody Allen's
droll-to-silly blending of "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Invisible Man" has
moments of genuine charm -- compliments of Mia Farrow and Joe Mantegna's
uptown lovers -- but this is definitely lesser Allen, a haphazard splicing of
ideas retrieved from "Manhattan," "Hannah and Her Sisters," etc. Look for Alec
Baldwin as a fast-lane ghost, Cybill Shepherd as a can't-be-bothered friend,
William Hurt as Alice's huffy husband. PG-13 (adult situations). (star)(star)

<TEXT>     Awakenings.  What constitutes sleep, of a physical or spiritual nature?
That's question director Penny Marshall ponders in this downbeat, rigorously
clinical re-telling of Rip Van Winkle fable. Robin Williams, at his most
mannered, plays nerd neurologist who happens upon similarities in "sleeping"
patients at Brooklyn hospital; Robert De Niro is patient who undergoes
miraculous "Charly" cure. Scrupulously understated but still manipulative,
predictable. PG-13. (star)(star) 1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond Rostand's
oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit and the nose "that launched a
thousand ships" gets glorious, cast-of-thousands treatment in this robust
French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed swordsman, poet and
braggart; Anne Brochet, Vincent Perez play Roxane and Christian, the young
lovers. Beautifully designed, choreographed and directed. PG (violent
swordplay). (star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances With Wolves.  Kevin Costner's
sprawling tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making
at its best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has
created a rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865.
Costner heads an excellent ensemble as titular character, a by-the-book
military man reborn as a Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake from his own
novel; music by John Barry. PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
Edward Scissorhands.  Or: Hans Christian Andersen Meets Frankenstein.
"Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here delivers a quirky,
sweet-natured little fable about a man-made boy who wasn't quite finished by
his inventor. Johnny Depp brings Chaplinesque poignancy to the title role;
Diane Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin are deadpan and dead-on as the suburban
family that adopts Edward. Vincent Price is glimpsed in flashbacks as Edward's
creator. PG-13 (for violence; may be too intense for some children).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Field.  Craggy Irish setting and robust lead by
a white-bearded Richard Harris can't save this heavy-handed adaptation of John
B. Keane play about a blustery farmer's battle for a bit of pasture. Harris
gives a good accounting of himself as appropriately named "Bull" McCabe, but
Brenda Fricker, Sean Bean and John Hurt as village idiot appear to have
wandered in from an overwrought D.H. Lawrence saga about family guilt and
smoldering passion. Directed, scripted by Jim Sheridan of "My Left Foot."
PG-13 (slight violence). (star)(star);    Flight of the Intruder.  Gung-ho,
boldly mounted adaptation of Stephen Coonts' best-seller about a rogue mission
to bomb Hanoi. Brad Johnson brings charisma and a certain Duke Wayne swagger
to the vigilante carrier pilot; Willem Dafoe, Danny Glover co-star,
respectively, as Johnson's war-crazy bombardier and mock-tough squadron
leader. PG-13 (combat violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The
Godfather III.  Francis Coppola picks up story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)
in late '70s, as family seeks respectability through Vatican business
ventures. Standing in the way are Sonny Corleone's hot-headed son (Andy
Garcia) and old-style Mafioso rivals who still live by the gun. Beautifully
mounted with moody, Oscar-worthy cinematography, but overall final installment
is downbeat, derivative. With Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppola. R
(violence, profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Green Card.  Sparkling interplay
between France's Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell turn what could have
been fluff piece into a very spirited and surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu
plays ne'er-do-well composer who weds MacDowell to confound immigrations and
stay in New York. Directed, scripted by Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13.
(star)(star)(star);    The Grifters.  Gritty, downbeat Jim Thompson's novel
about trio of con artists who out-con themselves becomes buoyant, sexy film
noir caper in British director Stephen ("Dangerous Liaisons") Frears' hands.
Anjelica Huston (now a platinum blonde), John Cusack, Annette Bening star as
catty mother, unlucky son and conspiring girlfriend. Pat Hingle, Henry Jones,
J.T. Walsh are among colorful supporting players. R (nudity, profanity,
violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who
popularized the Bard's "Romeo and Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a robust,
albeit severely pared down, version of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy. Mel
Gibson shows new range and depth as a now mostly seething Prince of Denmark,
determined to trap his father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul
Scofield, Ian Holm and Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Handsome production that
stirs the senses without taxing the gray matter. PG (violent swordplay).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Hidden Agenda.  Gritty, riveting conspiracy thriller
about the murder of American civil-liberties lawyer in Northern Ireland and
complicity of British intelligence. Yanks Brad Dourif, Frances McDormand get
top billing, but real star is Brian Cox, cast as a top government investigator
who vows not to take sides between IRA and occupying troops. Top-notch all the
way. R (profanity, violence). (star)(star)(star);    Home Alone.  Macaulay
Culkin, the cherubic wiseacre of "Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned
8-year-old who protects hearth and home from a pair of bungling burglars on
Christmas eve. Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern are the Mutt and Jeff second-story men.
Directed by Chris Columbus from a script by John ("Breakfast Club") Hughes. PG
(slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins"
collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever
amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes
undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son and
estranged wife of a killer. Pamela Reed, Carroll Baker co-star. PG-13 (may be
too intense for children under 6). (star)(star) 1/2;    L.A. Story.  Steve
Martin shares his love/hate feelings for La La Land in this loony,
surprisingly mushy fable that owes more of a debt than Martin cares to
acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious targets as health fads,
freeway gridlock, happy-talk news teams come under assault. Martin, who also
scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria Tennant and an all-knowing
electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic lovemaking). (star)(star);   
Meet the Applegates.  Ed Begley Jr., Stockard Channing co-star as Dick and
Jane Applegate, endangered South American beetles who disguise themselves as
humans and, with kids in tow, migrate to suburban Ohio. Sporadically funny
goof on consumerism, racism, pollution, etc., by team that brought us
infinitely more irreverent "Heathers." Sorry, guys, Saturday Night Live's
Coneheads have already mined this material. R (but could be PG-13 for
profanity). (star) 1/2;    Mermaids.  Cher tones down her standard bohemian
act for this kooky mother-daughter comedy set in New England in 1963.
Ubiquitous Winona Ryder plays the perpetually mortified daughter, who dreams
of Catholic sainthood; Bob Hoskins brings his usual good-natured bluster to
role of shoe-salesman suitor. Director Richard Benjamin's best since "My
Favorite Year." PG-13 (for language). (star)(star)(star);    Misery.  Stephen
King's darkest yarn becomes sunnier -- and funnier -- thriller in the hands of
director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, collaborators on "The
Princess Bride." James Caan is severely injured romance novelist who's saved,
then enslaved, by his "No. 1 fan," a Rocky Mountains nut case played by Kathy
Bates. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. 
Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward co-star as members of Kansas City's upper crust
who, in their inimitable way, either skate around or ignore brewing crises,
which range from uppity kids to world war. Adapted from the Evan S. Connell
novels by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and directed by James Ivory, team behind
"Maurice" and "A Room with a View." Yes, it's episodic and deliberately paced,
but the cumulative impact can be compared to that of a good Ingmar Bergman
movie. With Blythe Danner, Diane Kagan in key supporting roles. Whimsical,
melodrama-deflating score by Richard Robbins. PG-13 (adult themes).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    The Never Ending Story II: The Next Chapter. 
More action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by Michael Ende
book. Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns to parallel
world of Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy. Falkor the
luckdragon and Rock Biter return with a whole new menagerie of characters.
Less pretentious and better designed than its predecessor. Billed with
hilarious new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box Office Bunny." PG (OK for
family). (star)(star)(star);    Not Without My Daughter.  Sally Field in
compelling, if brazenly manipulative, adaptation of Betty Mahmoody book about
how, in mid-'80s, she and daughter were held hostage in Tehran by her Iranian
husband. Film is perfectly poised to feed on anti-Middle East paranoia and
predictably depicts Iran as world's most oppressive society. PG-13 (too
intense for children). (star)(star)(star);    Once Around.  Quirky, beguiling
little comedy about a Boston family, the gosling daughter and the incredibly
pushy salesman-suitor who disrupts their lives. "Always" co-stars Richard
Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter are re-teamed as the jerk-who-came-to-dinner and the
desperate-to-wed daughter. Danny Aiello, Gena Rowland are wonderful as the
amazed, then exasperated, parents. Nicely directed by Sweden's Lasse Hallstrom
("My Life as a Dog") from a first script by Malia Scotch Marmo. R (for
profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down Under.  Lightning paced
cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind of Aussie-set "Pinocchio"
goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel to '76 hit reteams Bianca
and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a United Nations for rodents.
Eva Gabor, Bob Newhart, John Candy, George C. Scott supplied the voices. G.
(star)(star)(star);    Run.  Old stranger-in-town idea dusted off as extremely
athletic workout for Patrick ("Loverboy") Dempsey, who, delivering on the
title, spends most of the picture dodging bullets and bad guys. Nothing
exceptional, but worthwhile for Dempsey's cocky performance and well-handled
action scenes. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);    The Russia House. 
First-rate adaptation of John le Carre best-seller about boozy publisher (Sean
Connery) who's enlisted by British intelligence to win over Russian who's
telling all about his country's military shortcomings. Michelle Pfeiffer is
terrific as Connery's Moscow contact/love interest; Klaus Maria Brandauer, Roy
Scheider, James Fox co-star. Jerry Goldsmith's jazz score, like everything
else here, goes down like high-grade vodka. R (but could be PG-13) for
profanity. (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Sheltering Sky.  Seductive,
eye-filling adaptation of Paul Bowles' novel about bored Americans drifting
through post-war North Africa. Debra Winger, John Malkovich co-star as married
couple who debate our place in cosmos while bed-hopping from oasis to oasis.
Slow going but worthwhile for Vittorio Storaro's desert photography and
Ryuichi Sakamoto's brilliant score. Directed by Bernardo ("The Last Emperor")
Bertolucci. R (for nudity). (star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs. 
What should have been the thriller of the decade becomes, under Jonathan
Demme's too-polite direction, a rather slavish and somewhat confusing tale of
two psychos and the FBI trainee who uses one to track the other. Jodie Foster,
Anthony Hopkins co-star. Based on the loads creepier Thomas Harris novel. R
(violence, gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the
Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts returns as abused wife who stages her
own death, then takes a new identity in idyllic Midwestern burg. Patrick
Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking husband and new beau, respectively.
Source novel took a stab at dealing with issue of abused wife reassembling her
life; movie reduces premise to slasher cliches. Directed by Joseph ("True
Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);    Warlock.  Julian
Sands stars as evildoer of the title, a 17th-century satanist who's spirited,
"Terminator"-style, to late 20th-century Malibu. Familiar supernatural doings
and mediocre effects are helped by director Steve Miner's humorous approach
and Lori Singer's mouthy heroine. R (for gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Book of Love.  Another "Porky's"-type teen comedy, this one boasts
negligible distinction of being set in Scranton, Pa., during the '50s. Chris
Young, Keith Coogan play new kid in school and nerd sidekick. Director Robert
Shaye has fun bringing hero's daydreams to life, but overall this flashback
isn't hip enough by half. PG-13. (star) 1/2;    Bride of Re-Animator.  More
"morbid doodling" by Dr. Herbert West, whose iridescent-green serum brought
army of cadavers back to twitching life in 1985's "Re-Animator." Broader,
campier than original, but still lots of fun gross-outs, such as when
five-fingered what's-it escapes from basement lab. Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott
reprise their roles as the Ivy League Frankenstein and reluctant, love-smitten
assistant. R (nudity, gruesome makeup effects.) (star)(star)(star);    Class
Action.  Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio team up as father-daughter
San Francisco lawyers arguing opposite sides of corporate-negligence case.
Melodramatic generation-conflict script comes to thudding halt with
preposterous courtroom showdown. Save yourself the cash: Check out "L.A. Law"
on an off night. R (profanity). (star) 1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond
Rostand's oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit and the nose "that launched

French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed swordsman, poet and

PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);    The Doors.  Oliver Stone's
frenzied, if simplistic, portrait of rocker Jim Morrison and the band that
defined moody sensuality of the '60s with "Light My Fire," "Riders on the
Storm," etc. Val Kilmer electrifies in later concert re-enactments. An
ambitious undertaking that comes closer than most rock biopix to capturing
spirit of times. R (profanity, nudity). (star)(star)(star);    Edward
Scissorhands.  Or: Hans Christian Andersen Meets Frankenstein.
"Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here delivers a quirky,

Ghost.  An undisciplined mix of sappy romance and supernatural comedy, this
movie about a murdered lover (Patrick Swayze) trying to contact his girlfriend
(Demi Moore) with the help of an outrageous medium (Whoopi Goldberg) has some
very good moments. Rated PG-13 (brief profanity, violence). Reviewed by Tom
Sabulis. (star)(star) 1/2;    The Godfather III.  Francis Coppola picks up

by Suspicion.  Clunky, old-fashioned melodrama about hot-shot director (Robert
De Niro) who's blacklisted for refusing to "name names" at the McCarthy
witch-hunt hearings. Surprisingly tame, given the incendiary material. Annette
Bening, George ("Cheers") Wendt co-star as De Niro's ex-wife and turncoat
friend. Directed, written by Irwin Winkler. PG-13 (slight profanity). (star)
1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who popularized the Bard's "Romeo and

The Hard Way.  Neat idea (obnoxious Hollywood star tails New York cop for
"research") is turned into proficient, occasionally laugh-out-loud-funny
comedy thanks to energetic, self-parodic performances by James Woods and
Michael J. Fox and typical whiz-bang direction by John ("Stakeout") Badham.
Alas, central antagonism goes soft and mushy. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star) 1/2;    He Said, She Said.  Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Perkins are
rival Baltimore journalists who become popular point/counterpoint TV
commentators -- until their romantic involvement takes its toll. A
sparkling-to-morose roundelay. The paranoid fantasies are fairly hilarious,
but instead of upending sexual stereotypes, they are reinforced. PG-13 (slight
profanity, nudity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Home Alone.  Macaulay Culkin, the
cherubic wiseacre of "Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned 8-year-old
who protects hearth and home from a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas
eve. PG (slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    If Looks Could Kill.  Nifty
espionage comedy starring likable Richard Grieco as high-school ne'er-do-well
who, during summer in Paris, is mistaken for a CIA operative. Linda Hunt,
Roger Rees have fun with the delightfully churlish archenemies intent on (you
got it!) world domination. Surprisingly fun, good-natured OO7 spoof. PG-13
(slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Ju Dou.  Controversial Oscar nominee
from China charts downfall of star-crossed lovers. Li Bao-Tian, Gong Li
co-star as laborer and "aunt" who bear a child every bit as autocratic and
unfeeling as the master/boss they attempt to con. Breathtakingly beautiful in
design, conception, but re-cycled film-noir plot bogs down all too quickly.
Directed by Zhang Yi-Mou. Exclusively San Francisco's Gateway. No MPAA rating
(could be PG-13 for adultery plot). (star)(star)(star);    Kindergarten Cop. 
"Twins" collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a
clever amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who
goes undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son
and estranged wife of a killer. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under
6). (star)(star) 1/2;    King Ralph.  John Goodman stars in a slap-sticky
comedy that never deviates from the obvious but is occasionally funny in spite
of itself. Ralph is a lounge singer who finds himself the next in line for the
British throne. Peter O'Toole walks through his role as the royal adviser. No
surprises here, but harmless and hilarious. PG (for profanity). Reviewed by
Knight-Ridder News Service. (star)(star)(star);    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin
shares his love/hate feelings for La La Land in this loony, romantic fable
that owes more of a debt than Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody
Allen. Such obvious targets as health spas, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news

Tennant and an all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic
lovemaking). (star)(star);    The Nasty Girl.  Every German's complicity in
Nazi war crimes is again scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from Germany.
Michael Verhoeven combines romance, dark comedy to show how his homeland's
so-called "Economic Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies. Lena Stolze plays
an exuberant Pollyanna whose research for a national essay contest unearths
embarrassing secrets. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack City.  Mario van Peebles directs the
story of a solitary cop who devotes his life to squashing drug dealers, and a
dealer so powerful he seems unsquashable. The two square off. R (for violence,
profanity, brief nudity, sex). Reviewed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers.
(star)(star)(star);    The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter.  More
action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by Michael Ende book.
Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns to parallel world of
Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy. Less pretentious and
better designed than its predecessor. PG (OK for family). (star)(star)(star); 
  Not Without My Daughter.  Sally Field in compelling, if brazenly
manipulative, adaptation of Betty Mahmoody book about how, in mid-'80s, she
and daughter were held hostage in Tehran by her Iranian husband. PG-13 (too
intense for children). (star)(star)(star);    Once Around.  Quirky, beguiling
little comedy about a Boston family, the gosling daughter and the pushy
salesman-suitor who disrupts their lives. "Always" co-stars Richard Dreyfuss
and Holly Hunter are re-teamed as the jerk-who-came-to-dinner and the
desperate-to-wed daughter. Danny Aiello, Gena Rowland are wonderful as the
parents. R (for profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down Under. 
Lightning-paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind of
Aussie-set "Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel to
'76 hit reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a
United Nations for rodents. G. (star)(star)(star);    Robot Carnival. 
Animated anthology from Japan that has moments of inspiration (the wrap-around
sequence, Takashi Nakamura's "Nightmare") but, overall, is on a par with
trashy Saturday-morning superhero cartoons. "Starlight Angel" short, crammed
with Ken and Barbi facsimiles, is particularly hard to take. San Jose's Towne
Theater. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13 for scenes of apocalypse).
(star)(star);    Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  Tom Stoppard's
note-perfect, surprisingly visual adaptation of his own award-winning play,
which proffers worm's-eye view of doings at Elsinore castle as Hamlet plots
death of his father's killers. Gary Oldman, Tim Roth couldn't be better as the
title players who muddle on despite suspicion that they don't exist beyond
confines of Shakespeare's narrative. Richard Dreyfuss co-stars as lead Player
(aka Fate). PG. (star)(star)(star)(star);    Scenes From a Mall.  Woody Allen,
Bette Midler as husband and wife who learn of one another's infidelities on an
anniversary shopping trip. Allen appears distracted, and Midler seems muzzled
in this so-what satire by Paul Mazursky ("Down and Out in Beverly Hills"), who
has nothing new to say so rehashes all the old car-phone, beeper and sushi
jokes in yet another lame attempt at trashing La La Land. R (for profanity).
(star) 1/2;    The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been ride of the
season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a slavish,
too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of
dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to track the other.
Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all traces of
femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins, typically,
overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a reptilian wacko. R (violence,
gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but
entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory, compliments of Disney.
Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes more of a Rambo than
Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a
lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG.
(star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts
returns as abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in
idyllic Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking
husband and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a stab at dealing with
issue of abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces premise to slasher
cliches. Directed by Joseph ("True Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity).

<LEADPARA>  Glenn Lovell reviews films on a scale of no stars to 4.; Alice.  Woody Allen's
droll-to-silly blending of "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Invisible Man" has
moments of genuine charm -- compliments of Mia Farrow and Joe Mantegna's
uptown lovers -- but this is definitely lesser Allen, a haphazard splicing of
ideas retrieved from "Manhattan," "Hannah and Her Sisters," etc. Look for Alec
Baldwin as a fast-lane ghost, Cybill Shepherd as a can't-be-bothered friend,
William Hurt as Alice's huffy husband. PG-13 (adult situations). (star)(star)

<TEXT>     Awakenings.  What constitutes sleep, of a physical or spiritual nature?
That's question director Penny Marshall ponders in this downbeat, rigorously
clinical re-telling of Rip Van Winkle fable. Robin Williams, at his most
mannered, plays nerd neurologist who happens upon similarities in "sleeping"
patients at Brooklyn hospital; Robert De Niro is patient who undergoes
miraculous "Charly" cure. Scrupulously understated but still manipulative,
predictable. PG-13. (star)(star) 1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond Rostand's
oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit and the nose "that launched a
thousand ships" gets glorious, cast-of-thousands treatment in this robust
French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed swordsman, poet and
braggart; Anne Brochet, Vincent Perez play Roxane and Christian, the young
lovers. Beautifully designed, choreographed and directed.PG (violent
swordplay). (star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances With Wolves.  Kevin Costner's
sprawling tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making
at its best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has
created a rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865.
Costner heads an excellent ensemble as titular character, a by-the-book
military man reborn as a Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake from his own
novel; music by John Barry. PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
Edward Scissorhands.  Or: Hans Christian Andersen Meets Frankenstein.
"Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here delivers a quirky,
sweet-natured little fable about a man-made boy who wasn't quite finished by
his inventor. Johnny Depp brings Chaplinesque poignancy to the title role;
Diane Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin are deadpan and dead-on as the suburban
family that adopts Edward. Vincent Price is glimpsed in flashbacks as Edward's
creator. PG-13 (for violence; may be too intense for some children).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Field.  Craggy Irish setting and robust lead by
a white-bearded Richard Harris can't save this heavy-handed adaptation of John
B. Keane play about a blustery farmer's battle for a bit of pasture. Harris
gives a good accounting of himself as appropriately named "Bull" McCabe, but
Brenda Fricker, Sean Bean and John Hurt as village idiot appear to have
wandered in from an overwrought D.H. Lawrence saga about family guilt and
smoldering passion. Directed, scripted by Jim Sheridan of "My Left Foot."
PG-13 (slight violence). (star)(star);    Flight of the Intruder.  Gung-ho,
boldly mounted adaptation of Stephen Coonts' best-seller about a rogue mission
to bomb Hanoi. Brad Johnson brings charisma and a certain Duke Wayne swagger
to the vigilante carrier pilot; Willem Dafoe, Danny Glover co-star,
respectively, as Johnson's war-crazy bombardier and mock-tough squadron
leader. PG-13 (combat violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star)The Godfather
III.  Francis Coppola picks up story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in late
'70s, as family seeks respectability through Vatican business ventures.
Standing in the way are Sonny Corleone's hot-headed son (Andy Garcia) and
old-style Mafioso rivals who still live by the gun. Beautifully mounted with
moody, Oscar-worthy cinematography, but overall final installment is downbeat,
derivative. With Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppola. R (violence,
profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Green Card.  Sparkling interplay between
France's Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell turn what could have been fluff
piece into a very spirited and surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu plays
ne'er-do-well composer who weds MacDowell to confound immigrations and stay in
New York. Directed, scripted by Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13.
(star)(star)(star);    The Grifters.  Gritty, downbeat Jim Thompson's novel
about trio of con artists who out-con themselves becomes buoyant, sexy film
noir caper in British director Stephen ("Dangerous Liaisons") Frears' hands.
Anjelica Huston (now a platinum blonde), John Cusack, Annette Bening star as
catty mother, unlucky son and conspiring girlfriend. Pat Hingle, Henry Jones,
J.T. Walsh are among colorful supporting players. R (nudity, profanity,
violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who
popularized the Bard's "Romeo and Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a robust,
albeit severely pared down, version of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy. Mel
Gibson shows new range and depth as a now mostly seething Prince of Denmark,
determined to trap his father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul
Scofield, Ian Holm and Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Handsome production that
stirs the senses without taxing the gray matter. PG (violent swordplay).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Home Alone.  Macaulay Culkin, the cherubic wiseacre of
"Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned 8-year-old who protects hearth
and home from a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas eve. Joe Pesci, Daniel
Stern are the Mutt and Jeff second-story men. Directed by Chris Columbus from
a script by John ("Breakfast Club") Hughes. PG (slight profanity).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins" collaborators Ivan Reitman and
Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie
comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes undercover as substitute teacher to
ferret out (quite literally) the son and estranged wife of a killer. Pamela
Reed, Carroll Baker co-star. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under 6).
(star)(star) 1/2;    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin shares his love/hate feelings
for La La Land in this loony, surprisingly mushy fable that owes more of a
debt than Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious
targets as health fads, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news teams come under
assault. Martin, who also scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria
Tennant and an all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic
lovemaking). (star)(star);    Misery.  Stephen King's darkest yarn becomes
sunnier -- and funnier -- thriller in the hands of director Rob Reiner and
screenwriter William Goldman, collaborators on "The Princess Bride." James
Caan is severely injured romance novelist who's saved, then enslaved, by his
"No. 1 fan," a Rocky Mountains nut case played by Kathy Bates. R (violence,
profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.  Paul Newman, Joanne
Woodward co-star as members of Kansas City's upper crust who, in their
inimitable way, either skate around or ignore brewing crises, which range from
uppity kids to world war. Adapted from the Evan S. Connell novels by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala and directed by James Ivory, team behind "Maurice" and "A Room
with a View." Yes, it's episodic and deliberately paced, but the cumulative
impact can be compared to that of a good Ingmar Bergman movie. With Blythe
Danner, Diane Kagan in key supporting roles. Whimsical, melodrama-deflating
score by Richard Robbins. PG-13 (adult themes). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
The Nasty Girl.  Every German's complicity in Nazi war crimes is again
scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from Germany. Michael Verhoeven combines
whimsy, romance, dark comedy to show how his homeland's so-called "Economic
Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies. Lena Stolze plays an exuberant
Pollyanna whose research for a national essay contest unearths embarrassing
secrets about neighbors and Catholic Church officials. No MPAA rating (could
be PG-13). (star)(star)(star)(star);    The Never Ending Story II: The Next
Chapter.  More action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by
Michael Ende book. Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns
to parallel world of Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy.
Falkor the luckdragon and Rock Biter return with a whole new menagerie of
characters. Less pretentious and better designed than its predecessor. Billed
with hilarious new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box Office Bunny." PG (OK
for family). (star)(star)(star);    Nothing But Trouble.  Dan Aykroyd's
delayed (and retitled) horror spoof co-stars Chevy Chase, Demi Moore as
wayfarers who run a stop sign in a grim burg called Valkenvania and, like
umpteen couples in the old-dark-house classics, find themselves the "guests"
of a monstrous host (Aykroyd under tons of peeling latex). Aspires to be
"National Lampoon's New Jersey Chainsaw Massacre" but is neither very funny
nor ghastly. PG-13 (profanity). (star);    Not Without My Daughter.  Sally
Field in compelling, if brazenly manipulative, adaptation of Betty Mahmoody
book about how, in mid-'80s, she and daughter were held hostage in Tehran by
her Iranian husband. Film is perfectly poised to feed on anti-Middle East
paranoia and predictably depicts Iran as world's most oppressive society.
PG-13 (too intense for children). (star)(star)(star);    Once Around.  Quirky,
beguiling little comedy about a Boston family, the gosling daughter and the
incredibly pushy salesman-suitor who disrupts their lives. "Always" co-stars
Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter are re-teamed as the jerk-who-came-to-dinner
and the desperate-to-wed daughter. Danny Aiello, Gena Rowland are wonderful as
the amazed, then exasperated, parents. Nicely directed by Sweden's Lasse
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog") from a first script by Malia Scotch Marmo. R
(for profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down Under.  Lightning
paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind of Aussie-set
"Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel to '76 hit
reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a United
Nations for rodents. Eva Gabor, Bob Newhart, John Candy, George C. Scott
supplied the voices. G. (star)(star)(star);    Run.  Old stranger-in-town idea
dusted off as extremely athletic workout for Patrick ("Loverboy") Dempsey,
who, delivering on the title, spends most of the picture dodging bullets and
bad guys. Nothing exceptional, but worthwhile for Dempsey's cocky performance
and well-handled action scenes. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);    The
Russia House.  First-rate adaptation of John le Carre best-seller about boozy
publisher (Sean Connery) who's enlisted by British intelligence to win over
Russian who's telling all about his country's military shortcomings. Michelle
Pfeiffer is terrific as Connery's Moscow contact/love interest; Klaus Maria
Brandauer, Roy Scheider, James Fox co-star. Jerry Goldsmith's jazz score, like
everything else here, goes down like high-grade vodka. R (but could be PG-13)
for profanity. (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Sheltering Sky.  Seductive,
eye-filling adaptation of Paul Bowles' novel about bored Americans drifting
through post-war North Africa. Debra Winger, John Malkovich co-star as married
couple who debate our place in cosmos while bed-hopping from oasis to oasis.
Slow going but worthwhile for Vittorio Storaro's desert photography and
Ryuichi Sakamoto's brilliant score. Directed by Bernardo ("The Last Emperor")
Bertolucci. R (for nudity). (star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs. 
What could have been ride of the season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost
polite direction, a slavish, too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris
novel about a pair of dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to
track the other. Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all
traces of femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins,
typically, overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a hissing,
reptilian-slippery wacko. R (violence, gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star)
1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts returns as
abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in idyllic
Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking husband
and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a stab at dealing with issue of
abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces premise to slasher cliches.
Directed by Joseph ("True Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star);    Three Men and a Little Lady.  Sequel to 1987 comedy hit about
all-thumbs bachelors and their infant ward trades on charm of original while
substituting clunky farcical situations. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, Ted
Danson reprise roles as shy architect, dopey cartoonish, womanizing actor. PG.

<TEXT>     Class Action.  Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio team up as
father-daughter San Francisco lawyers arguing opposite sides of
corporate-negligence case. Melodramatic generation-conflict script comes to
thudding halt with preposterous courtroom showdown. Save yourself the cash:
Check out "L.A. Law" on an off night. R (profanity). (star) 1/2;    The
Comfort of Strangers.  Paul Schrader and Harold Pinter collaborated on this
sinuous, sensuous adaptation of Ian McEdwan's novel about foreigners in Venice
who fall under the spell of a couple into voyeurism, S&amp;M, etc. Rupert Everett,
Natasha Richardson play the perpetually lost tourists; Christopher Walken,
Helen Mirren have fun with the purposely over-the-top host and hostess. Dark,
unsettling, often rudely funny. R (for nudity, violence). (star)(star)(star)
1/2;    Dances with Wolves.  Kevin Costner's sprawling tribute to the
vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making at its best. Borrowing
from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has created a rich tapestry of
adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865. Costner plays a by-the-book
military man reborn as a Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake from his own
novel; music by John Barry. PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
Defending Your Life.  Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this droll
stroll through the hereafter, which now resembles an antiseptic industrial
park. Rip Torn is hilarious as lawyer charged with making Brooks' case in
heaven; Meryl Streep wings it on a smile and chuckle as our hero's celestial
love interest. Brooks' fulfills promise of "Lost in America" with this one. PG
(slight profanity). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Doors.  Oliver Stone's
frenzied, if simplistic, portrait of rocker Jim Morrison and the band that
defined moody sensuality of the '60s with "Light My Fire," "Riders on the
Storm," etc. Val Kilmer electrifies in later concert re-enactments, but is
less convincing or interesting in scenes which attempt to pinpoint roots of
Morrison's mystic, dark-tinged music. With Meg Ryan and Kathleen Quinlan. R
(profanity, nudity). (star)(star)(star)Green Card.  Sparkling interplay
between France's Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell turn what could have
been fluff piece into a very spirited and surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu
plays ne'er-do-well composer who weds MacDowell to confound immigrations and
stay in New York. Directed, scripted by Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13.
(star)(star)(star);    The Grifters.  Jim Thompson's novel about trio of con
artists who out-con themselves becomes buoyant, sexy film-noir caper in
British director Stephen ("Dangerous Liaisons") Frears' hands. Anjelica Huston
(now a peroxide blonde), John Cusack, Annette Bening star as catty mother,
unlucky son and conspiring girlfriend. R (nudity, profanity, violence).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Hard Way.  Neat idea (obnoxious Hollywood star
tails New York cop for "research") is turned into proficient, occasionally
laugh-out-loud-funny farce thanks to energetic, self-parodic performances by
James Woods and Michael J. Fox and typical whiz-bang direction by John
("Stakeout") Badham. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    If Looks
Could Kill.  Nifty espionage comedy starring likable Richard Grieco as
high-school ne'er-do-well who, during summer in Paris, is mistaken for a CIA
operative. Linda Hunt, Roger Rees have fun with the delightfully churlish
archenemies intent on (you got it!) world domination. PG-13 (slight
profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Journey of Hope.  Swiss Oscar-winner inspired
by news account of Turkish family that finds deceit, friendship, finally
tragedy on the road to Switzerland and "new beginning." Hardly the best of
this year's foreign-language nominees, it's still a work of quiet intensity
and undeniable integrity. There won't by a dry eye in the house during final
20 minutes. Directed Xavier Koller. No MPAA rating (could be PG)
(star)(star)(star);    Ju Dou.  Controversial Oscar nominee from China charts
downfall of star-crossed lovers. Li Bao-Tian, Gong Li co-star as laborer and
"aunt" who bear a child every bit as autocratic and unfeeling as the
master/boss they scorn. Breathtakingly beautiful, but re-cycled film-noir plot
bogs down all too quickly. Directed by Zhang Yi-Mou. No MPAA rating (could be
PG-13 for adultery plot). (star)(star)(star);    A Kiss Before Dying.  "Fatal
Attraction" author James Dearden's attempt at Hitchcockian thriller misfires
badly. Matt Dillon, Sean Young co-star as psychotic social climber and rich
twins high on killer's hit list (Young is doubly forgettable in dual roles).
Inserts from "Vertigo" only serve to remind how far from the mark this
ludicrous concoction is. Taken from Ira Levin novel, filmed in '56 with Joanne
Woodward, Robert Wagner. R (violence, slight nudity). (star);    La Femme
Nikita.  Luc Besson, of the stylish and empty "Subway" and "Big Blue," returns
with a sweet-to-savage policier that rates a "Wow!" for its visual
pyrotechnics and a "Huh?" for its idiotic story line, which mixes "My Fair
Lady" and "Dirty Harry." Anne Parillaud is the title character, a punkette
sociopath made over as government assassin. R (violence). (star)(star)(star); 
  L.A. Story.  Steve Martin shares his love/hate feelings for La La Land in
this loony, romantic fable that owes more of a debt than Martin cares to
acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious targets as health spas,
freeway gridlock, happy-talk news come under assault. Martin, who also
scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria Tennant and an all-knowing
electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic lovemaking). (star)(star);   
The Long Walk Home.  The 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., is dramatized
in this excellent character study co-starring Sissy Spacek and a never-better
Whoopi Goldberg as a suburban do-gooder and her quietly resentful black maid.
Both are forced to re-think priorities when their families are threatened in
different ways. Credit Richard ("Heartland") Pearce with the strong,
understated direction. One of the year's best! PG (for slight violence).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Mister Johnson.  Rich, beautifully photographed and
acted adaptation of Joyce Cary novel about a happily unethical clerk who
serves his colonial "lords" in 1923 West Africa and earns their wrath in the
bargain. Maynard Eziashi is perfect as title character, who's as charming as
he is maddening; Pierce Brosnan, Edward Woodward are among the whites whose
paternal policies lead to tragedy. Directed by Bruce ("Driving Miss Daisy")
Beresford. PG-13 (but recommend for young teens). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;   
Mortal Thoughts.  Art-house darling Alan ("Choose Me") Rudolph returns with
his most commercial venture yet, a bleakly funny, blue-collar spin on French
classic "Diabolique." Demi Moore, Glenne Headly play Jersey wives involved in
mysterious (and mutually beneficial) homicides; Bruce Willis is the deserving
victim, an obnoxious wife-beater. With Harvey Keitel as cagey cop sorting out
the facts. Appropriately ominous jazz score by Mark Isham, who collaborated
with Rudolph on "Trouble in Mind." R (profanity, violence).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack City.  Mario Van Peebles makes solid
directorial debut with this blaxploitation spin on "Little Caesar." Wesley
Snipes, Ice-T co-star as Harlem drug czar and the undercover cop who vows to
infiltrate his cocaine factory. Hip, violent and energetic -- the rap
generation's answer to "Superfly." R (violence, profanity, nudity)
(star)(star) 1/2;    The Object of Beauty.  John Malkovich, Andie MacDowell
are perfectly paired as American lovers abroad who are seriously overextended,
financially and emotionally. They discover the truth about themselves and
their relationship when a small statue is filched. With Joss Ackland, Lolita
Davidovich and, as deaf-mute hotel maid, the sensational Rudi Davies.
Fashioned by Michael Lindsay-Hogg as comedy of manners with a bitter
aftertaste. R (profanity, slight nudity). (star)(star)(star);    One Good Cop.
 Or: Mr. Mom Joins the Force. Michael Keaton plays New York cop who becomes
guardian of three youngsters when his partner is gunned down. Keaton attempts
to skate by on charm and one-liners, but mix of "Father Knows Best" schmaltz
and street sadism takes it toll. Directed, written by Heywood Gould, former
cop reporter who wrote "Cocktail." R (violence, profanity). (star);    Oscar. 
Sly Stallone attempts a Damon Runyon fable with mixed results. Stallone
himself is humorously discombobulated as mobster attempting to go straight as
daughter plots to elope with chauffeur, accountant, linguistic coach --
whoever! But comic-opera approach (goosed by Rossini score) will either leave
you slapping your knee or pulling at your hair. Fun supporting cast includes
Peter Riegert, Kirk Doulgas, Don Ameche, hilariously prissy Tim Curry.
Directed by John Landis. PG (OK for entire family). (star)(star);    Out for
Justice.  Aikido champ Steven Seagal returns in his best cop thriller since
"Above the Law." Ultra-violent, single-minded script pits Seagal's Brooklyn
narc against wigged-out psycho from the old neighborhood (the baby-faced
William Forsythe). Credit the fluid, lightning-charged direction to grade-B
ace John ("Best Seller") Flynn. R (non-stop violence, profanity).
(star)(star)(star);    A Rage in Harlem.  Like the '50s Chester Himes novel on
which it's based, this gangland melodrama plies the sentimental and the
sadistic, the comic and depraved. Results are wildly uneven, but debuting
director Bill Dukes coaxes wonderfully quirky performances from blue-ribbon
cast, which includes Danny Glover, Zakes Mokae, Badja Djola and a deliciously
sultry Robin Givens. Forest Whitaker's pious stooge appears to have been
modeled after Jerry Lewis' patsy. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star);
   The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been ride of the season becomes,
under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a slavish, too-densely plotted
adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of dangerous sociopaths and the
FBI trainee who uses one to track the other. Jodie Foster is fine as novice
agent who must suppress all traces of femininity to earn her stripes; Anthony
Hopkins, typically, overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a reptilian
wacko. R (violence, gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;   
Shipwrecked.  Crude but entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory,
compliments of Disney. Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes
more of a Rambo than Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island;
Gabriel Byrne fumes a lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in
Fiji and Spain. PG. (star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia
("Pretty Woman") Roberts plays abused wife who stages her own death, then
takes a new identity in idyllic Iowa burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson
co-star as stalking husband and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a
stab at dealing with issue of abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces
premise to slasher cliches. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);   
Spartacus.  Re-release of 1960 epic about slave uprising in ancient Rome still
packs wallop, thanks to cagey performances by Charles Laughton, Laurence
Olivier and especially Peter Ustinov and then-31-year-old Stanley Kubrick's
stylish way with gladiatorial bouts and climactic battle. Kirk Douglas mines
title character for pathos and angry defiance; Jean Simmons lends giddy,
earthy support as "Spartacus' woman." A wild blend of Fellini-esque decadence
and now-campy Hollywood excess. 70mm prints shrunk to splotchy 35mm for Bay
Area runs. PG-13 (violence). (star)(star)(star);    Switch.  Another
gender-change comedy a la "Tootsie," "All of Me," this time starring Ellen
Barkin as sexist pig named Steve who's reincarnated as foulmouthed, two-fisted
cookie named Amanda. Barkin is mostly hilarious in the lead, but
director-writer Blake Edwards doesn't know where to go with the premise.
Hence, this "liberated" comedy's oddly sexist, homophobic feel. With Jimmy
Smits, JoBeth Williams. R (for gratuitous profanity, nudity). (star)(star);   
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.  Heroes in
Half-Shells return in broader, funnier sequel to their 1990 hit. Parents will
applaud decision to downplay the violence while lamenting the non-existent
plot. With Ernie Reyes Jr. as Turtles' new human ally, David Warner as
professor who deals in toxic waste, and some fun surprises from Jim Henson's
Creature Shop. PG (may be too intense for some children). (star)(star);    Toy
Soldiers.  Odd, unsettling blend of prep-school shenanigans and Rambo-esque
mayhem fro Mr. High Concept, Daniel ("Beverly Hills Cop") Petrie Jr., here
making directorial debut. Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, Keith Coogan are among
rebellious rich kids who save Virginia academy from Columbian terrorists; Lou
Gossett Jr., Denholm Elliott are pushover dean and headmaster. Sort of like
"Full Metal Jacket" meets "Porky's." R (extreme violence, profanity). (star)

<TEXT>     Bride of Re-Animator.  More "morbid doodling" by Dr. Herbert West, whose
iridescent-green serum brought army of cadavers back to twitching life in
1985's "Re-Animator." Broader, campier than original, but still lots of fun
gross-outs, such as when five-fingered what's-it escapes from basement lab.
Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott reprise their roles as the Ivy League Frankenstein
and reluctant, love-smitten assistant. Directed by Brian Yuzna; effective
(though hardly original) score by Richard Band. R (nudity, gruesome makeup
effects.) (star)(star)(star);    Class Action.  Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio team up as father-daughter San Francisco lawyers arguing opposite
sides of corporate-negligence case. Melodramatic generation-conflict script
comes to thudding halt with preposterous courtroom showdown. Save yourself the
cash: Check out "L.A. Law" on an off night. R (profanity). (star) 1/2;   
Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond Rostand's oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit
and the nose "that launched a thousand ships" gets glorious, cast-of-thousands
treatment in this robust French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed
swordsman, poet and braggart; Anne Brochet, Vincent Perez play Roxane and
Christian, the young lovers. Beautifully designed, choreographed and directed.
PG (violent swordplay). (star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances with Wolves. 
Kevin Costner's sprawling tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned
epic movie-making at its best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira
Kurosawa, Costner has created a rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux
Indians, circa 1865. Costner plays a by-the-book military man reborn as a
Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake from his own novel; music by John
Barry. PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);    The Doors.  Oliver
Stone's frenzied, if simplistic, portrait of rocker Jim Morrison and the band
that defined moody sensuality of the '60s with "Light My Fire," "Riders on the
Storm," etc. Val Kilmer electrifies in later concert re-enactments, but is
less convincing or interesting in scenes which attempt to pinpoint roots of
Morrison's mystic, dark-tinged music. With Meg Ryan and Kathleen Quinlan as
Morrison's biggest fan and craftiest manipulator, respectively. An ambitious
undertaking that comes closer than most rock biopix to capturing spirit of
times. R (profanity, nudity). (star)(star)(star);    The Five Heartbeats. 
Robert Townsend of "Hollywood Shuffle" attempts a screen bio of '60s Motown
group (modeled on Dels and Four Tops) beset by drugs, crooked producers,
clashing egos. Ambitious and touching in spots, with standout work by Michael
Wright as paranoid lead singer, but too melodramatic in execution. R
(profanity). (star)(star);    The Godfather III.  Francis Coppola picks up
story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in late '70s, as family seeks
respectability through Vatican business ventures. Standing in the way are
Sonny Corleone's hot-headed son (Andy Garcia) and old-style Mafioso rivals who
still live by the gun. Beautifully mounted with moody, Oscar-worthy
cinematography, but overall final installment is downbeat, derivative. With
Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppola. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Green Card.  Sparkling interplay between France's Gerard
Depardieu and Andie MacDowell turn what could have been fluff piece into a
very spirited and surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu plays ne'er-do-well
composer who weds MacDowell to confound immigrations and stay in New York.
Directed, scripted by Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13. (star)(star)(star);   
The Grifters.  Gritty, downbeat Jim Thompson's novel about trio of con artists
who out-con themselves becomes buoyant, sexy film-noir caper in British
director Stephen ("Dangerous Liaisons") Frears' hands. Anjelica Huston (now a
peroxide blonde), John Cusack, Annette Bening star as catty mother, unlucky
son and conspiring girlfriend. Pat Hingle, Henry Jones, J.T. Walsh are among
colorful supporting players. R (nudity, profanity, violence).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Guilty by Suspicion.  Clunky, old-fashioned
melodrama about hot-shot director (Robert De Niro) who's blacklisted for
refusing to "name names" at the McCarthy witch-hunt hearings. Surprisingly
tame, given the incendiary material. Annette Bening, George ("Cheers") Wendt
co-star as De Niro's ex-wife and turncoat friend. Directed, written by Irwin
Winkler. PG-13. (slight profanity). (star) 1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli,
who popularized the Bard's "Romeo and Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a
robust, albeit severely pared down, version of Shakespeare's most famous
tragedy. Mel Gibson shows new range and depth as a now mostly seething Prince
of Denmark, determined to trap his father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan
Bates, Paul Scofield, Ian Holm and Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Handsome
production that stirs the senses without taxing the gray matter. PG (violent
swordplay). (star)(star) 1/2;    The Hard Way.  Neat idea (obnoxious Hollywood
star tails New York cop for "research") is turned into proficient,
occasionally laugh-out-loud-funny comedy thanks to energetic, self-parodic
performances by James Woods and Michael J. Fox and typical whiz-bang direction
by John ("Stakeout") Badham. Alas, central antagonism goes soft and mushy, and
Badham's elaborate "North by Northwest" finale couldn't be more more
belabored. With Stephen Lang as hilariously accessible serial killer. R
(violence, profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Home Alone.  Macaulay Culkin, the
cherubic wiseacre of "Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned 8-year-old
who protects hearth and home from a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas
eve. PG (slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    If Looks Could Kill.  Nifty
espionage comedy starring likable Richard Grieco as high-school ne'er-do-well
who, during summer in Paris, is mistaken for a CIA operative. Linda Hunt,
Roger Rees have fun with the delightfully churlish archenemies intent on (you
got it!) world domination. Surprisingly fun, good-natured OO7 spoof. PG-13
(slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Iron &amp; Silk.  Mark Salzman plays
himself, a gee-whiz American abroad, in this romanticized flashback to
mainland China on the eve of Tiananmen Square. Pan Quingfu also appears as
himself, a bulldog of a martial-arts teacher. With Jeanette Lin Tsui as
Salzman's guide to the customs and etiquette of China. Corny, picturesque and
quite entertaining. No MPAA rating (OK for family viewing).
(star)(star)(star);    Ju Dou.  Controversial Oscar nominee from China charts
downfall of star-crossed lovers. Li Bao-Tian, Gong Li co-star as laborer and
"aunt" who bear a child every bit as autocratic and unfeeling as the
master/boss they attempt to con. Breathtakingly beautiful in design,
conception, but re-cycled film-noir plot bogs down all too quickly. Directed
by Zhang Yi-Mou. Exclusively San Francisco's Gateway. No MPAA rating (could be
PG-13 for adultery plot). (star)(star)(star);    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins"
collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever
amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes
undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son and
estranged wife of a killer. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under 6).
(star)(star) 1/2;    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin shares his love/hate feelings
for La La Land in this loony, romantic fable that owes more of a debt than
Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious targets
as health spas, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news come under assault. Martin,
who also scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria Tennant and an
all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic lovemaking).
(star)(star);    The Long Walk Home.  The 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery,
Ala., is dramatized in this excellent character study co-starring Sissy Spacek
and a never-better Whoopi Goldberg as a suburban do-gooder and her quietly
resentful black maid. Both are forced to re-think their priorities when their
families are threatened in different ways. Credit Richard ("Heartland") Pearce
with the strong, understated direction. One of the year's best! PG (for slight
violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Nasty Girl.  Every German's
complicity in Nazi war crimes is again scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from
Germany. Michael Verhoeven combines whimsy, romance, dark comedy to show how
his homeland's so-called "Economic Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies.
Lena Stolze plays an exuberant Pollyanna whose research for a national essay
contest unearths embarrassing secrets. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack City.  Mario van Peebles directs the
story of a solitary cop who devotes his life to squashing drug dealers, and a
dealer so powerful he seems unsquashable. The two square off in a ghetto
battle for the hearts, minds and crack-wracked bodies of New Jack City. The
film moves forward with single-minded determination. Van Peebles should have
found more proficient actors for supporting parts (himself included), but
Ice-T has rough grace and Judd Nelson sheds all mannerisms to play a
dead-eyed, dead-ended cop. R (for violence, profanity, brief nudity, sex).
Reviewed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers. (star)(star)(star);    The Neverending
Story II: The Next Chapter.  More action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite
inspired by Michael Ende book. Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan
Brandis) returns to parallel world of Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and
adult empathy. Falkor the luckdragon and Rock Biter return with a whole new
menagerie of characters. Less pretentious and better designed than its
predecessor. Billed with hilarious new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box
Office Bunny." PG (OK for family). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down
Under.  Lightning-paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind
of Aussie-set "Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel
to '76 hit reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a
United Nations for rodents. Eva Gabor, Bob Newhart, John Candy, George C.
Scott supplied the voices. G. (star)(star)(star);    Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.  Tom Stoppard's note-perfect, surprisingly visual
adaptation of his own award-winning play, which proffers worm's-eye view of
doings at Elsinore castle as Hamlet plots death of his father's killers. Gary
Oldman, Tim Roth couldn't be better as the courtier/chumps of title who muddle
on despite suspicion that they don't exist beyond confines of Shakespeare's
narrative. Richard Dreyfuss co-stars as lead Player (aka Fate). Beautifully
designed, photographed. Much superior to Zeffirelli's recent "Hamlet." PG.
(star)(star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been
ride of the season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a
slavish, too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of
dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to track the other.
Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all traces of
femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins, typically,
overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a reptilian wacko. R (violence,
gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but
entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory, compliments of Disney.
Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes more of a Rambo than
Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a
lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG.
(star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts
returns as abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in
idyllic Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking
husband and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a stab at dealing with
issue of abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces premise to slasher
cliches. Directed by Joseph ("True Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity).

Those Heroes in the Half-Shells return in broader, funnier sequel to the 1990
hit. Parents will applaud decision to downplay the violence while lamenting
the non-existent plot. With San Jose's Ernie Reyes Jr. as Turtles' new human
ally, David Warner as the all-thumbs professor who deals in toxic waste, and

<TEXT>     Book of Love.  Another "Porky's"-type teen comedy, this one boasts
negligible distinction of being set in Scranton, Pa., during the '50s. Chris
Young, Keith Coogan play new kid in school and nerd sidekick. Director Robert

Andersen Meets Frankenstein. "Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here
delivers a quirky, sweet-natured little fable about a man-made boy who wasn't
quite finished by his inventor. Johnny Depp brings Chaplinesque poignancy to
title role; Diane Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin are deadpan and dead-on as
suburban family that adopts Edward. PG-13 (violence; may be too intense for

two square off in a ghetto battle for the hearts, minds and crack-wracked
bodies of New Jack City. The film moves forward with single-minded
determination. Van Peebles should have found more proficient actors for
supporting parts (himself included), but Ice-T has rough grace and Judd Nelson
sheds all mannerisms to play a dead-eyed, dead-ended cop. R (for violence,
profanity, brief nudity, sex). Reviewed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers.
(star)(star)(star);    The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter.  More
action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by Michael Ende book.
Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns to parallel world of
Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy. Falkor the luckdragon
and Rock Biter return with a whole new menagerie of characters. Less
pretentious and better designed than its predecessor. Billed with hilarious
new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box Office Bunny." PG (OK for family).
(star)(star)(star);    Reversal of Fortune.  Barbet Schroeder's re-telling of
the Claus von Bulow media circus works on a number of levels: as chilling
social satire as well as corking good trial-of-the-century docudrama. Glenn
Close is the exasperating, tragically neglected Newport heiress who points a
finger from her hospital bed; Jeremy Irons plays the suspiciously detached
Claus; Ron Silver steals every other scene as civil-rights lawyer Alan
Dershowitz drawn, against his better judgment, to the glamour and controversy
of the case. R (profanity). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.  Tom Stoppard's note-perfect, surprisingly visual
adaptation of his own award-winning play, which proffers worm's-eye view of
doings at Elsinore castle as Hamlet plots death of his father's killers. Gary
Oldman, Tim Roth couldn't be better as the courtier/chumps of title who muddle
on despite suspicion that they don't exist beyond confines of Shakespeare's
narrative. Richard Dreyfuss co-stars as lead Player (aka Fate). PG.
(star)(star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been
ride of the season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a
slavish, too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of
dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to track the other.
Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all traces of
femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins, typically,
overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a reptilian wacko. R (violence,
gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but
entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory, compliments of Disney.
Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes more of a Rambo than
Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a
lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG.
(star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts
returns as abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in
idyllic Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking
husband and new beau, respectively. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);   
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.  Those Heroes in the
Half-Shells return in broader, funnier sequel to the 1990 hit. Parents will
applaud decision to downplay the violence while lamenting the non-existent
plot. With San Jose's Ernie Reyes Jr. as Turtles' new human ally, David Warner
as the all-thumbs professor who deals in toxic waste, and some fun surprises
from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. PG (may be too intense for some children).

<LEADPARA>  The big news on the rep-house scene is the arrival of Derek Jarman's "The
Garden," a provocative re-telling of the Passion Play with the Christ figure
now represented by two young male lovers who are detailed, badgered and
tortured. The latest from the prolific Jarmen, who has AIDS, is playing San
Francisco's Roxie (16th Street) tonight and Saturday. It's part of a "Cutting
Edge III" series that also includes electrifying political dramas from
Ecuador, Bulgaria and Cuba.;    This weekend's Castro schedule is dedicated to
more popular fare. Tonight at San Francisco's Castro Street theater are two of
the best of '90: Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" with Stephen Frears' "The
Grifters." Saturday, the emphasis is on giddier satire -- Peter Weir's "Green
Card" with Gerard Depardieu and Andie McDowell, and Paul Mazursky's
ill-conceived "Scenes From a Mall" with Woody Allen and Bette Midler. "Green
Card" is breezy and sophisticated; "Scenes" is anemic and strident and not at
all worthy of the talents involved.  </LEADPARA>

adaptation of his own play, "Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead," paired with
Monty Python's 1972 anthology "And Now for Something Completely Different"
(tonight and Saturday). It's a shame the theater didn't put "R&amp;G" with
Zeffirelli's new "Hamlet" (Sunday and Monday with 1990s "Cyrano de Bergerac").
"R&amp;G" is an absurdist comedy that ponders the concepts of fate and chance as
it details what might have been happening behind the scenes at Elsinore Castle.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IT'S both fortunate and unfortunate that Michel Brault's 1989 Canadian feature
"A Paper Wedding" should be released so hot on the heels of Peter Weir's
"Green Card.";   Without question, Brault's film presents itself with a
greater degree of conviction and urgency. Itdoesn't have some of the more
superficial pleasures of Weir's film, but then it also doesn't break into a
sweat trying to inject romantic bubbles into flat champagne. It plays it
straight.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AN ANNIVERSARY WALTZ OF SIMPLY HONEST LIES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  REVIEW; MOVIES  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The stories are virtually identical. In each a marriage of convenience is
arranged between a woman and a foreigner who faces deportation. In this case
the fortyish college professor (Genevieve Bujold) may be bored with her
married lover, but she's anything but thrilled when her lawyer sister suggests
that she enter into a marriage of convenience with Pablo (Manuel Aranguiz), a
Chilean dissident, so that he can remain in Canada and avoid being sent back
to jail and probable death in his homeland.;   Eventually, though, she agrees.
After all, it's pretty cut and dried -- little more than a couple of hours out
of her life. As Bujold plays her, Claire is nobody's fool -- she prides
herself on her clear-eyed lack of illusions. But when she's left alone in her
apartment after the ceremony, all decked out in her wedding dress, her
calculated pragmatism provides very cold comfort. Is this the way it was
supposed to be for me?;   Bujold is magnificently subtle in these scenes.
Whenever a hint of emotion creeps in, her features seem to clench as if she
were fighting desperately not to feel. Mixing sadness with self-possession,
and dignity with turbulence, she shows the downside to lowered expectations.; 
 When the immigration officials begin to snoop around to see whether the
couple are indeed married, she reacts with the petulance of a spoiled child.
She feels violated, and when Pablo moves in to prepare for their interview
with immigration, she blocks his questions about the details of her life as if
she were fending off blows. She refuses to let down her guard.;   Slowly,
though, as the paper bride and groom cram for their interrogation, they begin
to reveal more of themselves -- and become more important to each other --
than they had expected.;   As a character, Pablo isn't allowed much depth;
what comes across, though, especially in the scenes with his countrymen, is
his low-key, masculine solidity. He's a type, a broad-shouldered shelter from
the storm like Alan Bates in "An Unmarried Woman" and Kris Kristofferson in
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore." Even though his nights are overrun with
nightmares from his imprisonment back home, he's rooted in a way that Claire
can't help but envy.;   Brault has to walk an emotional tightrope in these
scenes; both characters are forced to play their cards close to their vests.
But he keys the mood of the film to Claire, and her entrenched reserve makes
it impossible for us to know how the hand is going to play itself out.;   "A
Paper Wedding" isn't a great movie, but it is a pleasingly modulated, honest
one. And Bujold's performance gives it a kind of grandeur. She shows us the
way real grown-ups think.; A Paper Wedding; (In French with English
subtitles); Not rated; Cast: Genevieve Bujold, Manuel Aranguiz; Director:

FT  14 APR 94 / Arts: Treacherous moral terrain - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tom and Viv (15) Brian Gilbert
Widow's Peak (PG) John Irvin
Stalingrad (15) Joesph Vilsmaier
Fearless (15) Peter Weir
It is a shame that in Tom and Viv, which recounts TS Eliot's tortured
marriage to first wife Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the poetry does not extend to
the marketing campaign. 'For Better - For Worse. Forever,' simpers the
poster above a shot of Tom (Willem Dafoe) and Viv (Miranda Richardson)
canoodling in a punt. But this, we soon learn, is the kiss of betrayal. As
Eliot becomes famous, finds God and renounces the devil, he renounces his
wife too, discarding her like a first draft. It is a bit rich: Viv has
mopped his brow, rewritten his work and provided the title for 'The Waste
Land'. Less helpfully, however, she has trashed hotel rooms, embarrassed him
in public and drawn a knife on Virginia Woolf.
In Richardson's wild-eyed hand wringing performance, Viv's illness - a
hormonal imbalance which causes manic mood swings - is distressingly vivid,
though occasionally overblown. Dafoe exceeds expectations. His clipped,
repressed tones (Vincent Price meets Edward Fox) betray the bewilderment and
distaste of a man who can only communicate through his pen.
Adapted from Michael Hastings' stage play, these are complex, harrowing
emotions, handled for the most part without sentiment by director Brian
Gilbert. The finger is only pointed firmly at Eliot when Dafoe dons his
Crippen specs and, instead of his usual tactic of packing Viv off to the
sales, carts her off to the asylum. The final scenes fall foul of
bathchairs-on-the-lawn syndrome and some ropey symbolism, but does not
belittle the pain of what Viv calls 'a quarter of a century of
frightfulness'.
There is an immediate feeling of familiarity in the first scene of Widows'
Peak, as a vintage car zooms down a country lane, unsettling cap-wearing
cyclists. This hoary old device, also gainfully employed in Tom and Viv, is
a standard scene-setter for British period dramas. Having witnessed the
sepia-tinted landscape change gradually to colour, we fear the worst.
This comedy mystery is set in a 1920s Irish village, where widows are as
'plentiful as freckles on a redhead'. The indomitable Mrs Doyle Counihan
(Joan Plowright) has, inexplicably, taken impoverished spinster Miss O'Hare
(Mia Farrow) under her wing. Aha, the armchair psychiatrist exclaims. What
better way to get over her Manhattan marital misery than starring in a saga
of retribution and small-town female solidarity where a woman is not
complete until himself is six feet under? And, what is more, in a role
originally intended for Mia Farrow's mother, Maureen O'Sullivan. But,
thankfully, this is no Irish Steel Magnolias. The village is a hotbed of
tittle-tattle which erupts into no little malice. Farrow's passive persona
in Woody Allen films is pepped up by a spiteful tongue and a nice line in
anti-English vitriol. Soon, she is embroiled in a seething vendetta with
Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson), who sets her coquettish sights on Mrs
Counihan's idle son, Godfrey (Adrian Dunbar, trying manfully to be boyish).
As insults are hurled and poison pen letters dispatched, John Irvin's
otherwise unremarkable direction makes good use of Farrow's curious mix of
innocence and obsession. Plowright holds proceedings together with
full-throated ease and there is a mischievous performance from Jim Broadbent
as Farrow's suitor.
The moral terrain is just as treacherous in Stalingrad, German director
Joseph Vilsmaier's account of the Nazis' siege which foundered amid the
frozen wilderness of the Russian winter. It is a brave film that seeks to
enlist sympathy for a batallion of stormtroopers as they set about the
locals in the name of the Fatherland.
While not an apologist, Vilsmaier is quick to draw the distinction between
the generally honourable foot soldiers ('I'm not a Nazi, Otto') and the
jack-booted sadists who command them. Betrayed by inept generals and
unfaithful wives, these men are decent sorts, albeit recruited from the
ranks of cinema's military stereotypes.
Flushed with success in Africa, the men are sent north to face slaughter at
the hands of the Red Army. Dreaming of the future as their train trundles
past innocuous fields towards an impending doom, there are already uneasy
parallels with the transportation of Jews to the death camps. Both fates,
the film suggests, are equally horrific.
Unflinching in its graphic condemnation of war, the film only loses its way
as the men lose theirs on the long march home. It is not helped by some
cheesy death scenes ('Mom, I'm sorry to leave you') and a mournful score -
all lone trumpets and soaring strings - which confuses perpetrator and
victim.
And when the closing creditsglumly inform us that only 6,000 Germans
returned from the campaign, it is difficult to suppress the blimpish
response: 'Well, you started it.'
Peter Weir's fascinating new film Fearless is about an air crash and its
effect on the lives and minds of two survivors, writes Nigel Andrews. The
movie's under-performance last year at the US box office is probably due to
its not being Airport '93.
First sin: the story begins after the crash, with the living emerging into
the smoking debris, crying out for lost loved ones. There are no scenes of
panic in the cabin, of flying food-trays or of Charlton Heston/Karen Black
wrestling with the controls. Second sin: the story then goes all
Antonioni-esque. The architect hero Max Klein ((Jeff Bridges) wanders the
landscape of his past life (wife Isabella Rossellini, children, colleagues),
sensing the new powers and 'freedoms' that his brush with death has brought.
Is he quite alive? Is he unknowingly dead? And the Hispanic girl he
befriends (Rosie Perez) who lost her baby in the crash - can he save her
from despair and misplaced guilt? Add a whole lot of Christ symbolism, from
Max's stigmata-like body wound to his very name (Max Klein - Big Little -
Father Son), and it is no wonder that popcorn-eating America fled screaming
towards Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger.
My advice: take a set of working brain cells and see. Occasionally the
high-symbolist seriousness becomes ponderous. But mostly, Weir's
allegorising is lightfooted and Rafael Yglesias's script, from his own
novel, is full of dark ingenuity and sly metaphysical jokes.
Peter Weir can be an maddening director. He has spent his career looping in
and out of his vocational forte - that eerie, playful pop-mysticism - like
an aeroplane receiving faulty messages from the tower. Now Picnic At Hanging
Rock and The Last Wave; now Green Card, Dead Poets Society . .
But Fearless is the real, daring thing. The screen and soundtrack shimmer
with animating uncertainty for two hours. Changing camera speeds are used to
conjure moments of scarce-perceptible slow motion; a pedestrian crossing
sign's red hand has a sudden other-worldly menace; the toys in a shopping
mall seem more 'real' than the ghostly Bridges and Perez; the babble of
voices at the crash site are interwoven with eerie cries and chitterings as
if from another planet. The style is fit to dazzle us and Bridges and Perez
keep a human pulse beating, like an ostinato, even when the style itself
threatens to overpower the drama.

HANDICAPPERS SET EARLY LINE ON SEASON'S FIELD OF 21 MAJOR MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Paramount's "The Godfather, Part III," Columbia's "Awakenings," Universal's 
"Kindergarten Cop" and Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady" are the four 
films likeliest to rack up the highest box-office grosses this Christmas 
season, according to people in the industry who bank on their ability to 
predict these things. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the schedule is more jammed than usual, with the major studios set 
to release 21 feature films, three more than last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The saying goes that the pie is only so big, that carving it into so many 
pieces will mean a smaller slice for each," said John Krier, president of 
Exhibitor Relations. "But everyone is hoping that the pie will get a little 
larger. There are so many pictures out there people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
So, which of these horses are going to break out of the pack? After talking 
with studio executives, producers, agents, marketing people and others in the 
business whose guessing games are more informed than others, here's a handicap 
of the field: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morning-Line Favorites: 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather, Part III" (Paramount, Dec. 25): An "event" film with tremendous 
"wanna-see," even more "wanna-love." Few believe it will be the work of art its 
Oscar-winning predecessors were, but who's going to skip it? 
</P>
<P>
"Awakenings" (Columbia, Dec. 20): A drama starring Robert DeNiro and Robin 
Williams, reportedly at the top of their form, this Penny Marshall film is said 
to pack a lot of emotional punch. DeNiro and the film have been mentioned as 
Oscar contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Kindergarten Cop" (Universal, Dec. 21): Insiders say this action-comedy, which 
re-teams director Ivan Reitman with his "Twins" star Arnold Schwarzenegger, has 
received incredibly high marks at research screenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena Vista, Nov. 21): The sequel to the 
studio's 1987 Christmas hit, "Three Men and a Baby," has also tested well and, 
as a sequel, has a built-in audience coming in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contenders: 
</P>
<P>
"Edward Scissorhands" (20th Century Fox, Dec. 7, limited opening): Fox is high 
on this modern-day, off-kilter fable directed by fantasy-king Tim Burton 
("Batman," "Beetlejuice"). Though Johnny Depp is supposed to be terrific and 
research screenings have gone well, not everyone is convinced: "Show me a film 
that Depp has opened, let alone sustained," said one producer. "And good 
reviews only bring you grosses like 'Avalon.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Misery" (Columbia-Castle Rock, Nov. 30): This ultra-scary psychological 
thriller, adapted by William Goldman from a Stephen King novel, has reportedly 
played even better with research audiences than director Rob Reiner's last film 
-- "When Harry Met Sally." Sources say it will revive James Caan's career and 
make a star of film newcomer Kathy Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia House" (MGM-Pathe, Dec. 19 limited): Word is the movie, adapted from a 
John le Carre novel, moves slowwwwwly. But the novel was one of the author's 
most successful and accessible, and no one is betting against the pairing of 
Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Green Card" (Buena Vista, Dec. 25 limited): A comedy produced, directed, and 
written by Peter Weir starring the ubiquitous Gerard Depardieu and Andie 
McDowell ("sex, lies, and videotape"). Disney believes it's another "Pretty 
Woman." Industry insiders give it a chance of filling one of the five best 
picture Oscar spots on February's final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" (Orion, Dec. 14): A coming-of-age story featuring Cher, Winona Ryder 
and Bob Hoskins, said by some to be Ryder's movie. There were well-publicized 
problems on the set (Richard Benjamin is the third director) and early 
eyewitness reports are decided mixed. "People are still fascinated by Cher," 
says one producer. "But Benjamin, who hasn't performed in a major way since 'My 
Favorite Year' has to be considered a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
"Havana" (Universal, Dec. 12, limited): A Sydney Pollack love story set against 
the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford and Lena Olin ("Enemies, A Love 
Story"). Redford is said to deliver his best performance in years, but the buzz 
is that there is little chemistry between the glamorous stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dark Horses: 
</P>
<P>
Other films may have tougher going, if the conventional wisdom is borne out. 
Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking Too" (Dec. 14) -- high interest and awareness 
notwithstanding -- could find its inventive gimmick wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "Come See the Paradise" (Dec. 12), a World War II drama about an 
interracial relationship, is said by one eyewitness to be "the first truly 
boring film Alan Parker has made." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice," (Orion, Dec. 25, limited) is characterized as one of Woody Allen's 
more minor films, while Fox faces an uphill battle trying to sell "Predator 2" 
(Nov. 16) without Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. Warner's "The 
Rookie" (Dec. 7) is perceived as a benchmark film for Clint Eastwood, an actor 
whose popularity as an action star has been on the decline. "If it takes off, 
his franchise will regain some luster," said one producer. "If it fails it'll 
be 'next chapter.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Warner's "The Sheltering Sky" (Dec. 7, limited), Bernardo Bertolucci ("The 
Last Emperor") reportedly elicits exquisite performances from his cast (Debra 
Winger and John Malkovich) but seems more comfortable on the epic scale than on 
an intimate one. "The fact that Warner Bros. didn't screen it early says to me 
that there's something slightly rotten," said an executive at a rival studio. 
</P>
<P>
Warners has another tough sell with "Hamlet" (Dec. 19, limited). Not only is it 
Shakespeare, but the casting of Mel Gibson in the lead has reportedly drawn 
laughs in theaters where the trailer has been shown. Still, the word on 
Gibson's performance is good and director Franco Zeffirelli has been a master 
at popularizing works of the Bard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longshots: 
</P>
<P>
As always, there's talk of some clinkers. Paramount's "Almost An Angel" (Dec. 
19.) is said to be an unfortunate departure for "Crocodile Dundee" duo Paul 
Hogan and wife Linda Kozlowski. MGM-Pathe's "Rocky V, The Final Bell"(Nov. 16) 
has been called "the major groan of the Christmas season," an expensive 
embarrassment to a studio with a paucity of riches. 
</P>
<P>
Research screenings of Brian De Palma's "The Bonfire of the Vanities" (Warner 
Bros., Dec. 21) have reportedly not gone well. One eyewitness called it a 
"cartoon" of a film and questioned whether the material was suited to De 
Palma's blood-and-guts style. "Everyone is asking if Brian can find a way to 
mutilate a woman in it . . . Melanie Griffiths watch out," said a producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Out of the Gate: 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves" soared on opening weekend, turning in a 
per-screen average of more than $40,000. Industry analysts believe it will hold 
steady when it's released wide in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Outside: 
</P>
<P>
Independent films will also be jockeying for position. Among them, Miramax has 
three entries: Merchant/Ivory's "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" (Nov. 23, limited), a 
slow but tasteful art house film co-starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; 
"The Long Walk Home" (Dec. 25, limited), a well-intentioned civil rights drama 
starring Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg; and "The Grifters" (Dec. 5, L.A. 
one-week Oscar-qualifying run), a dark comedy with great performances by 
Anjelica Huston and Annette Bening considered a bit downbeat for holiday fare.

people from leaving in droves."

<LEADPARA>  I KNOW one person, aside from Kitty Kelley's editor Alice Mayhew, who has read
the Nancy Reagan-life-according-to-Kelley book. Doonesbury creator Garry
Trudeau has been allowed a peek. And Monday he will begin a series of strips
associated with what he has seen there -- to appear in his 700 newspapers
worldwide.;    "Nancy Reagan: an Unauthorized Biography" is the fourth in
Kelley's ongoing dissection of the high and mighty (Jacqueline Onassis,
Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra) and is still the best-guarded secret in
publishing. It has been kept most thoroughly under wraps by Simon &amp; Schuster.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Trudeau sent his strips out last week and has been holding his breath ever
since, hoping people in his syndicate will honor "the embargo" stamped on
same, and not tip his hand. Naturally, these comic strips will be
controversial and probably give some editors a few headaches. It won't be the
first time. Trudeau has had his work dropped from time to time because editors
considered his satiric attacks "too much." He himself has never backed off
from examining the Frank Sinatras and Donald Trumps of the world.;   
BEAUTIFUL DEFENSE: Actress Andie MacDowell comes to the defense of her "Green
Card" co-star Gerard Depardieu -- the center of criticism and controversy
because of statements he's allegedly made about having committed rape "too
many times to count" during his youth.;    "How do you pass judgment on a
child?" she says. As far as Depardieu's quotes in the 1978 "Film Comment"
magazine that "the girls wanted to be raped . . . there's really no such thing
as rape . . ." MacDowell believes it was "probably a total misunderstanding.
Gerard loves women so much and he was always so kind and so sweet to me, I
would be very surprised if he really said those things.";    MacDowell, who's
been in demand since 1989's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," had hoped "Green Card"
would be the vehicle to put her over the top. But the backlash against
Depardieu on these shores isn't helping the movie's fortunes.;    Still, she
needn't worry. She's starring opposite John Malkovich in the comedy "Object of
Beauty" due out this month. And she's Bruce Willis' leading lady in the
upcoming big-screen "Hudson Hawk." The former supermodel also just started
shooting the "A Domestic Dilemma" segment of HBO's "Women &amp; Men" trilogy with
Ray Liotta and already has her next feature film assignment lined up. She
starts shooting "Ruby Cairo" for director Graeme Clifford this fall.; From
Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    BIG-SCREEN SCENE: The
real-life saga of Palm Beach socialite Mollie Wilmont and the Venezuelan
freighter that crashed into her oceanfront property appears to be on its way
to the big screen -- as a break-into-dance style Disney musical, with "Evita"
and "Jesus Christ Superstar" co-creator Tim Rice likely aboard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' scored the most honors
in Golden Globe nominations announced today by the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
   The two war-oriented films, one about Vietnam, the other on the
Civil War, were nominated five times each, along with the modern
romance comedy.
   They were followed by ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right
Thing'' and ``The Little Mermaid'' with four nominations apiece.
   The Golden Globes, first of the Hollywood award season, often
serve as a bellwether for the Oscars, though the foreign press
members are noted for eccentricities.
   The Golden Globes divide films and star performances into two
categories, drama and musical or comedy.
   The nominees include:
   Motion Picture (Drama) _ ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right
Thing,'' ``Glory.''

``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Shirley Valentine,'' ``The War of the
Roses,'' ``When Harry Met Sally...''
   Actress Performance (Drama) _ Sally Field, ``Steel Magnolias,''
Jessica Lange, ``Music Box,'' Andie MacDowell, ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' Michelle Pfeiffer, ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' Liv
Ullmann, ``The Rose Garden.''
   Actor Performance (Drama) _ Tom Cruise, ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' Daniel Day-Lewis, ``My Left Foot,'' Jack Lemmon, ``Dad'' Al
Pacino, ``Sea of Love,'' Robin Williams, ``Dead Poets Society.''
   Actress Performance (Musical or Comedy) _ Pauline Collins,
``Shirley Valentine,'' Meg Ryan, ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' Meryl
Streep, ``She-Devil,'' Jessica Tandy, ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
Kathleen Turner, ``The War of the Roses.''
   Actor Performance (Musical or Comedy) _ Billy Crystal, ``When
Harry Met Sally...,'' Michael Douglas, ``War of Roses,'' Morgan
Freeman, ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Steve Martin, ``Parenthood,'' Jack
Nicholson, ``Batman.''
   Supporting Actress _ Bridget Fonda, ``Scandal,'' Brenda Fricker,
``My Left Foot,'' Julia Roberts, ``Steel Magnolias,'' Laura San
Giacomo, ``sex, lies and videotape,'' Dianne Wiest, ``Parenthood.''
   Supporting Actor _ Danny Aiello, ``Do the Right Thing,'' Marlon
Brando, ``A Dry White Season,'' Sean Connery, ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade,'' Ed Harris, ``Jackknife,'' Denzel Washington,
``Glory,'' Bruce Willis, ``In Country.''
   Director _ Spike Lee, ``Do the Right Thing,'' Rob Reiner, ``When
Harry Met Sally...,'' Oliver Stone, ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
Peter Weir, ``Dead Poets Society,'' Edward Zwick, ``Glory.''
   Foreign Language Film _ ``Camille Claudel,'' France; ``Cinema
Paradiso,'' Italy; ``Jesus of Montreal,'' Canada; ``My Uncle's
Legacy,'' Yugoslavia, ``Story of Women,'' France.
   The foreign press also makes television awards, and the leading
nominee was ``L.A. Law'' with eight. ``Cheers'' and ``Lonesome
Dove'' followed with four.
   The Golden Globes will be presented at the Beverly Hilton Hotel
on Jan. 20, and will be seen on the TBS Superstation in a show
produced by Dick Clark.
   The foreign press will present its Cecil B. DeMille award to
Audrey Hepburn.

"Born on the Fourth of July," "Glory," and "When Harry Met Sally" -- with five 
nominations each -- were the clear favorites this year among the Hollywood 
Foreign Press Assn., which announced the nominees for its annual Golden Globe 
Awards Wednesday morning in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Following close behind with four nominations each were 'Dead Poets Society," 
"Do the Right Thing" (tapped by the L.A. Film Critics as the year's best 
picture), and Disney's animated fairy tale, "The Little Mermaid." On the 
television side, NBC's "L.A. Law" walked away with eight nominations, while 
NBC's "Cheers" received four, and ABC's "thirtysomething" -- which won last 
year's Golden Globe Award for best dramatic series -- earned three. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular TV miniseries or made for TV movies were "Lonesome Dove," with 
four nominations, and "Roe vs. Wade," with three. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe Awards, which will be handed out Jan. 20, often provide a good 
indicator of what direction the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
will take in awarding its coveted Oscars each year. In the past 11 years, eight 
Golden Globe winners in the dramatic film category -- including last year's 
winner, "Rain Man" -- went on to win Academy Awards for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
The 84 Hollywood-based foreign reporters who voted did shut out a handful of 
films considered possible Oscar candidates, including two Holocaust-themed 
films, "Triumph of the Spirit" and "Enemies, a Love Story," whose director Paul 
Mazursky was named the year's best director last week by the New York Film 
Critics Cirle; Kenneth Branagh's widely acclaimed "Henry V," and Phil Alden 
Robinson's baseball fantasy, "Field of Dreams." The latter omission is not 
surprising because, as a rule, baseball films are rarely popular overseas -- 
"Field of Dreams" was no exception at the foreign box office. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe nominees for best dramatic picture were "Born on the Fourth of 
July," in which Tom Cruise portrays Vietnam vet Ron Kovic; Woody Allen's 
morality play, "Crimes and Misdemeanors"; "Dead Poets Society," starring Robin 
Williams as a teacher who brings his iconoclastic style to a strict boys prep 
school; "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's controversial look at the makings of 
an urban race riot, and "Glory," a Civil War film about the fate of an 
all-black regiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July" also earned a best actor nomination for Cruise, a 
best director nomination for Oliver Stone, a best screenplay nomination for 
Stone and Kovic (on whose life the film is based), and a best original score 
nomination for John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory's" other nominees included Denzel Washington for his supporting role; 
Edward Zwick for direction; Kevin Jarre for his screenplay and James Horner for 
his original score. Another star of "Glory," Morgan Freeman, was overlooked for 
that film, but received a best actor nomination for his performance in "Driving 
Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe Awards touch a broader array of films than the Academy Awards 
because nominees are named in two separate motion-picture categories -- drama 
and musical/comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"When Harry Met Sally," a best picture nominee in the musical/comedy category, 
also earned nominations for stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, director Rob 
Reiner and screenwriter Nora Ephron. 
</P>
<P>
The other nominees for best musical/comedy were: "Driving Miss Daisy," which 
also drew a best actress nomination for Jessica Tandy; "Shirley Valentine," 
which garnered a best actress nomination for Pauline Collins; "The War of the 
Roses," which brought nominations for co-stars Kathleen Turner and Michael 
Douglas, and "The Little Mermaid," which earned another three nominations for 
its music. 
</P>
<P>
"My Left Foot," the New York film critics' choice as the year's best picture, 
was ignored in the best dramatic picture category. But its star, Daniel 
Day-Lewis, was nominated for best actor in a dramatic film. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Cruise and Day-Lewis, the foreign reporters nominated Jack 
Lemmon ("Dad"); Al Pacino ("Sea of Love"), and Robin Williams ("Dead Poets 
Society") in the best actor category for dramatic pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The best actors nominated in the musical/comedy category were Crystal, Douglas, 
Freeman, Steve Martin ("Parenthood") and Jack Nicholson ("Batman). 
</P>
<P>
The best actress nominees in the dramatic category were Sally Field ("Steel 
Magnolias"); Jessica Lange ("Music Box"); Andie MacDowell ("sex, lies and 
videotape"); Michelle Pfeiffer ("The Fabulous Baker Boys"), and Liv Ullmann 
("The Rose Garden.") 
</P>
<P>
Best actress nominees in the musical/comedy category were Collins, Ryan, Tandy, 
Turner and Meryl Streep ("She-Devil").

<HEAD>Oliver Stone Says Directors' Award May Speed His Work to the
Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver Stone, whose films often
follow tortuous paths to the screen, said winning the Directors
Guild of America award for ``Born on the Fourth of July'' should
speed his filmmaking process.
   ``It's giving me more freedom,'' Stone said Saturday night after
collecting the guild's top honor at its annual awards ceremony, a
bellwether for the Academy Awards.
   ``It's a tremendous validation for me. It means I'm doing the
right thing,'' said Stone, a self-described anarchist who has
directed a variety of deeply personal films, including ``Salvador''
and ``Wall Street.''
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Stone's account of the patriot
soldier Ron Kovic whose attitudes about war are shattered in
Vietnam, took more than 10 years to make.
   ``Platoon,'' the acclaimed Vietnam film that Stone also
directed, similarly was a hard sell.
   He said some film projects _ like ``Born on the Fourth of July''
_ can be improved when they have a long time to percolate. He was
quick to point out, too, that simply winning prizes and producing
box-office hits does not make movie making a cake walk.
   ```How sweet it is and how fleeting,'' he said when collecting
his award at a black-tie dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Backstage, he said his triumph soon would be old news. ``Success
and failure are both impostors,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Stone joins an elite list of directors who have
taken the guild's top honor twice in their careers (Stone also won
for ``Platoon''). Other dual winners include Joseph Mankiewicz,
George Stevens, David Lean, Robert Wise, Francis Ford Coppola and
Milos Forman.
   Stone, who becomes the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for
best director, said he plans to make a third film about Vietnam in
the next several years. He declined to say what the film will focus
on, saying only that it will not concern combat but ``another
aspect'' of war.
   Stone currently is working on a movie about the musical group
The Doors.
   In the 42 years the guild has been handing out the awards, only
three of its picks failed to win the Oscar.
   In addition to Stone, those nominated by the guild for best
director of a feature film were Woody Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Rob Reiner for ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' Phil
Alden Robinson for ``Field of Dreams'' and Peter Weir for ``Dead
Poets Society.''
   The Academy did not nominate Reiner or Robinson. Allen, Stone
and Weir are Oscar nominees, along with Kenneth Branagh for ``Henry
V'' and Jim Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   The guild awards _ chosen by a vote of the 9,000 members _ also
recognize best director in several other categories: television
comedy series, dramatic series (day and night), musical-variety,
dramatic specials, sports and commercials.
   Among the others honored were the directors of TV's ``Murphy
Brown'' and ``L.A. Law'' series.
   In television, the award for best director in a comedy went to
Barnet Kellman for the episode ``Brown Like Me,'' on CBS' ``Murphy
Brown.''
   Other TV awards: Dramatic special, Dan Curtis for ABC's ``War
and Remembrance''; dramatic nighttime series, Eric Laneuville for
the ``I'm in the Nude'' episode on NBC's ``L.A. Law''; dramatic
daytime series, Victoria Hochberg for the ``Jacob Have I Loved''
episode on PBS' ``Wonderworks.''
   Also, for musical variety show, Don Mischer for ``Gregory Hines:
Tap Dance in America,'' on PBS' ``Great Performances''; television
documentary, Peter Rosen for ``The Eighth Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition'' on PBS; sports event show, Bob Fishman for the
1989 U.S. Open Tennis Tournament on CBS.

   The mob movies ``The Godfather,
Part III'' and ``GoodFellas'' have begun to move in on Academy
Award turf, capturing 12 Golden Globe nominations between them.
   Oscar nominations won't be disclosed until Feb. 13, but
Thursday's Golden Globe selections established the two Mafia dramas
and Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' as strong early
favorites.
   ``The Godfather, Part III'' was nominated seven times and
``GoodFellas'' collected five nominations from the membership of
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
   In awards already presented, ``GoodFellas'' has been named best
film in year-end voting by film critics associations in New York
and Los Angeles.
   The National Board of Review selected ``Dances With Wolves,''
directed by and starring Costner, the best movie of the year. The
western collected the second most nominations - six - in Golden
Globe voting, including best dramatic motion picture.
   Other films receiving multiple nominations, four apiece, were
``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Reversal of
Fortune.''
   The Golden Globes do not carry the prestige of the Oscars, but
in past years have presaged Academy Award nominations fairly
accurately. Trophies will be presented Jan. 19 - the same day Oscar
ballots are mailed.
   The Golden Globes will be broadcast from Beverly Hills by cable
television's TBS.
   The ``Godfather'' sequel was selected for best dramatic motion
picture and received nominations for best actor (Al Pacino),
supporting actor (Andy Garcia), director (Francis Ford Coppola) and
best screenplay (Coppola and Mario Puzo.
   The movie also received nods for original score and original
song, ``Promise Me You'll Remember.''
   Costner was nominated for best actor and best director in his
first directing effort. ``Wolves'' co-star Mary McDonnell drew a
supporting actress nomination.
   ``GoodFellas''' five nominations included best dramatic motion
picture and best director for Martin Scorsese, also honored for
co-writing the movie.
   Unlike the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes divide films in two
categories - drama and musical or comedy.
   In one wacky selection, ``Ghost,'' the enormously popular
tearjerker, was judged in the musical-comedy category. Other
nominees for best musical or comic motion picture were ``Dick
Tracy,'' ``Green Card,'' ``Home Alone'' and ``Pretty Woman.''
   In another peculiar matchup, the 86 foreign press members said
Macaulay Culkin, the 10-year-old star of ``Home Alone,'' and Gerard
Depardieu, the great French actor who stars in ``Green Card,'' will
compete for best actor in a musical or comedy.
   Nominated for dramatic actress were Kathy Bates for ``Misery,''
Anjelica Huston for ``The Grifters,'' Michelle Pfeiffer for ``The
Russia House,'' Susan Sarandon for ``White Palace'' and Joanne
Woodward for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.''
   Best dramatic actor nominees, in addition to Costner and Pacino,
included Richard Harris for ``The Field,'' Jeremy Irons for
``Reversal of Fortune'' and Robin Williams for ``Awakenings.''
   Best musical or comic actress selections were Mia Farrow for
``Alice,'' Andie MacDowell for ``Green Card,'' Demi Moore for
``Ghost,'' Julia Roberts for ``Pretty Woman'' and Meryl Streep for
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   Best musical or comic actor competitors include Culkin,
Depardieu, Johnny Depp of ``Edward Scissorhands,'' Richard Gere of
``Pretty Woman'' and Patrick Swayze of ``Ghost.''
   Foreign language film nominees were ``Cyrano de Bergerac,''
``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' ``The Nasty Girl,'' ``Requiem for
Dominic'' and ``Taxi Blues.''
   Screenplay nominees were ``Dances with Wolves,'' ``Reversal of
Fortune,'' ``Avalon,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The Godfather Part
III.''
   Golden Globes are also presented in television. Among TV shows,
``L.A. Law'' led with five nominations and director David Lynch's
cult saga, ``Twin Peaks,'' had four.
   ``China Beach,'' the Vietnam War drama, was nominated for best
dramatic series while Dana Delany was nominated for best actress.
The series currently is off the air, but may come back in the
spring.

<TEXT>     For a moment there it looked as if President Bush and his cast-of-thousands
Persian Gulf production would upstage Hollywood's "night of nights" -- the
63rd annual Academy Awards gala (to be televised live at 6 p.m. Monday on Chs.
7, 11 and 13).;    Oscar, of course, has weathered previous conflicts -- in
Europe, the South Pacific, Korea and Vietnam. But fireworks overseas have a
way of deflating spirits, raining on the parade, etc. During times of turmoil,
the Academy joins in the war effort and pitches why-we-fight propaganda with
the best of 'em.;    But you can't help sensing industry-wide resentment.
Hollywood is not very good at sharing spotlights or headlines. (Nomination
announcement stories, usually assured of front-page treatment in newspapers
across the country, were down-graded this year as Bush's air bombardment
continued to dominate the news.);    Reflecting post-Vietnam pessimism, Oscar
braced itself for the worst: a long war and rock-bottom Nielsens. Oscar
security, always ridiculously tight, showed signs of rivaling that of Fort
Knox. In mid-February, when the nominations were announced, the Academy warned
of "beefed-up measures," which, for many of us Oscar-night veterans,
translated into visions of sandbags and barbed wire.;    Thankfully, that
scenario didn't come to pass. Instead of war-fatigued viewers, Oscar can look
forward to a large, euphoric crowd of super-patriots. How will this affect the
broadcast and, more important, the Academy membership's choices in the main
categories? You'd be safe in predicting there will be lots of patriotic
tub-thumping from the stage of Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium and virtually
none of the finger-waving for which Jane Fonda, Sacheen Littlefeather and
especially Vanessa Redgrave (in her pro-Palestinian speech upon winning for
"Julia" in 1977) are infamous.;    The big question Monday night: Will the
Academy, weary of conflict and controversy, be in an especially lighthearted
mood, rewarding such box-office frippery as "Pretty Woman" and "Ghost"? Or
will it take the opportunity to unfurl the flag, jump on the bandwagon and
reaffirm that Oscar is as American as Duke Wayne, Japanese imports and Arsenio
Hall in a tri-colored warm-up suit? The latter scenario is more likely. Which
means "Wolves" -- as in "Dances With Wolves" -- could come crashing through
the auditorium door with big wins in the best picture, best director and best
supporting actor categories.;    For comparison's sake, let's flash back to
March 7, 1946, and the first Oscar derby after Hiroshima and V-J Day. What
kind of mood were Academy members in? Did they embrace tough-minded drama, or
were they higher on comedy and romantic romps? Put differently, did they
wallow in victory or put aside home-front sacrifices (when Oscars were made of
plaster and klieg-light galas were seen as wasteful and harmful to national
security)?;    Answer: Oscar opted for hard-hitting drama over a pair of
family-oriented classics. Samuel Goldwyn and RKO's "The Best Years of Our
Lives," about the difficulties encountered by three soldiers returning to
civilian life, not only won, it won big, taking statuettes for best picture,
best actor (Fredric  March), best supporting actor (Harold Russell), best
director (William Wyler) and best cinematography. Its less dour competition?
Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" and Clarence Brown's "The Yearling.";   
It would take another four years before the Academy smiled again -- and voted
"All About Eve" (1950) and "An American in Paris" (1951) best picture in their
respective years.;    What sort of mood was Oscar in immediately following the
Korean and Vietnam wars? Hard to say. "The Greatest Show on Earth," an
overproduced Cecil B. DeMille circus epic, won in '52; "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" and "Rocky" won in '75 and '76, respectively.;    In recent
years the pendulum has swung between epic, European-flavored biography
("Gandhi," "Amadeus," "Out of Africa," "The Last Emperor") and home-grown
tales of social relevance ("Rain Man," "Driving Miss Daisy," "Terms of
Endearment"). The only film that stands apart in this crop is Oliver Stone's
"Platoon" -- epic in scope, by an American director and something of an
apologia for the downer Vietnam films of the late '70s ("The Deer Hunter,"
"Apocalypse Now").;    Can we discern any trends in all of this? Yes, that the
post-Iraqi war Academy will be in a more sober mood and that, after
back-to-back wins by "Rain Man" and "Driving Miss Daisy," Academy members will
probably heap their favors on another old-fashioned, epic-scale adventure.;   
The winner will be . . . "Dances With Wolves," of course.;    Kevin Costner's
sprawling Wild West opus covers all bases. It's big, pretty and well-crafted;
it's concerned with important issues (the systematic genocide of the Indian
nation, conservation, etc.); it comes with that all-important sense of moral
outrage; and, crucial at this juncture, it's by and about Americans. A vote
for "Dances" at once satisfies our need for self-examination and
self-aggrandizement.;    "Awakenings," with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams,
was too downbeat for Oscar's taste. "Ghost" was too mainstream and popular
(and already is available on tape, thus nullifying the box-office benefits of
a win). "The Godfather Part III" only made it into this category in deference
to Francis Coppola and his past achievements. "GoodFellas," the critics'
darling, is too dark and anarchic for an assemblage that snubbed such classics
as Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" and Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild
Bunch.";    As for the other categories, here's what we predict will happen,
followed by what we would like to see happen. As always, merit will take a
back seat to studio affiliations, block-voting and in-fighting.;    Best
actor;  Once you rule out Costner's wooden soldier boy in "Dances," De Niro's
modern-day Rip van Winkle (he's won twice before), and Richard Harris' extreme
long shot in "The Field," you're left with Gerard Depardieu as Cyrano de
Bergerac in the French epic of the same name and Jeremy Irons as the
insufferable Klaus von Bulow in "Reversal of Fortune." We favor Depardieu, but
no European male in a foreign-language film has ever won in this category.
Oscar will go with Irons, who was scandalously overlooked two years ago for
his work in "Dead Ringers.";    Best actress;  The best that can be said of
this category is that it doesn't include Sally Field or Shirley MacLaine. The
worst: it doesn't have Jessica Lange (for "Men Don't Leave"), Michelle
Pfeiffer ("The Russia House") or Glenn Close ("Reversal of Fortune"). Who'll
take home the brass? Previous supporting-actress winner Anjelica Huston for
her nervous-but-nervy con artist mom in "The Grifters." Kathy Bates, a New
York actress, isn't well enough known and she carries the stigma of a Stephen
King chiller ("Misery"). Julia Roberts of "Pretty Woman" still isn't thought
of as more than box-office insurance; Meryl Streep has won before and handed
in an amiable but hardly noteworthy performance in "Postcards From the Edge."
Our favorite: previous winner Joanne Woodward for "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge."
Unfortunately, her performance as the confused, eager-to-please Kansas City
matriarch is too textured and subtle for Oscar's taste.;    Supporting actor; 
Bruce Davison is the clear-cut favorite for his work in "Longtime Companion,"
but he could be upset by Joe Pesci as the most sadistic Mafioso in Martin
Scorsese's "GoodFellas." Andy Garcia ("Godfather III") and the
much-nominated-but-never-named Al Pacino ("Dick Tracy") don't have a prayer;
Graham Greene, the soft-spoken Sioux shaman in "Dances," could be carried
along by a "Dances" sweep, but his chances seem slim to remote. We'd be
equally pleased by a Davison or Greene win.;    Supporting actress;  A very
mixed field. Whoopi Goldberg, previously nominated for "The Color Purple,"
appears to be Oscar's choice for her reluctant medium in "Ghost." (She was
much better in the ignored "The Long Walk Home," which is only now going into
release.) Diane Ladd, another previous nominee, was selected for her vengeful
nut-case in "Wild at Heart"; Mary McDonnell and Lorraine Bracco drew nods for
"Dances" and "GoodFellas," respectively. Our choice: Bracco, as the naive wife
who undergoes the greatest transformation in "GoodFellas." Her corruption is
at the heart of this Dickensian "Mean Streets.";    Director;  The contest is
between first-time filmmaker Costner and the much-respected Scorsese. Having
favored Costner with a best-picture award, the Academy finally will recognize
Scorsese, who has been nominated twice before and should have won in 1980 with
"Raging Bull." The other nominees: Barbet Schroeder ("Reversal of Fortune"),
Stephen Frears ("The Grifters"), Coppola ("The Godfather Part III").;   
Original screenplay;  There were a lot of decent original scripts last year,
but they didn't make the cut. So whoever wins here won't have much to crow
about. Oscar will go with Barry Levinson's autobiographical "Avalon." His only
competition: Bruce Joel Rubin for the schmaltzy "Ghost." Also nominated: Woody
Allen ("Alice"), Peter Weir ("Green Card"), Whit Stillman ("Metropolitan").
We'll shrug and go with Weir or Stillman.;    Screenplay adaptation;  In
contrast to the previous category, the competition is keen here. Donald E.
Westlake ("The Grifters"), Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of Fortune"), Nicholas
Pileggi and Scorsese ("GoodFellas"), Steven Zaillian ("Awakenings") and
Michael Blake ("Dances") are all deserving. Oscar will go with Zaillian's
textbook-crisp endeavor; we favor the Pileggi-Scorsese script taken from
Pileggi's book.;    Cinematography;  Another impressive field. Dean Sempler
will win for his brilliant Wild West tableaux in "Dances," though Philippe
Rousselot also looks strong for the otherwise overlooked "Henry &amp; June." Our
choice: Sempler. Other nominees: Allen Daviau ("Avalon") and previous winners
Vittorio Storaro ("Dick Tracy") and Gordon Willis ("The Godfather III").;   
Film editing;  If there's any justice, Thelma Schoonmaker will take this one
in a walk for her bravura work on "GoodFellas." Neil Travis, who cut "Dances,"
looks to be Oscar's favorite, though.;    Original score;  Yes, you're right
-- this category is a scandal. Where are Elmer Bernstein ("The Grifters"),
Jerry Goldsmith ("The Russia House"), Richard Robbins ("Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge")
and Ryuichyi Sakamoto ("The Sheltering Sky")? In their place are a bunch of
veteran hacks -- John Williams ("Home Alone"), John Barry ("Dances"), Maurice
Jarre ("Ghost"). Randy Newman's music for "Avalon" is the best of this sorry
lot, but Oscar will go with previous winner Barry.;    Original song;  The
previous awards shows honored Jon Bon Jovi for "Blaze of Glory" (from "Young
Guns II"). Oscar has a chance to set the record straight by naming either
Stephen Sondheim's torchy "Sooner or Later" ("Dick Tracy") or Shel
Silverstein's defiant "I'm Checkin' Out" (warbled by Streep in "Postcards From
the Edge").;    Foreign-language film;  The Academy will make up for not
naming Depardieu best actor by picking France's ambitious "Cyrano de Bergerac"
here. Our choice: Germany's "The Nasty Girl." Also nominated: Switzerland's
little-seen "Journey of Hope," Italy's "Open Doors" and China's "Ju Dou." The
film was the subject of some controversy after China requested it be withdrawn
from competition and the Academy said, "Fat chance." The film's director,
Zhang Yi-Mou, has been forbidden by his government to attend the ceremony.

<LEADPARA>  Kevin Costner's epic western "Dances With Wolves" collected a leading 12
nominations for the Academy Awards announced today, including best actor and
director for Costner and best picture.;    Director Warren Beatty's "Dick
Tracy" was second with seven nominations, many in technical categories but
including best supporting actor for Al Pacino. "The Godfather Part III" also
had seven nominations, led by best picture and best supporting actor for Andy
Garcia.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'WOLVES' DANCES OFF WITH 12 NOMINATIONS
'GODFATHER III' AND 'DICK TRACY' ARE EACH
LISTED IN 7 CATEGORIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Today's nominations were shared by such critically acclaimed releases as
"The Grifters," which collected four nominations, and "Cyrano de Bergerac,"
which got five, and such lighter weight box office champs as "Ghost," which
drew five selections, and "The Hunt for Red October," with three.;   
Competing against "Dances With Wolves" and "The Godfather Part III" for best
picture in the March 25 presentations were "Awakenings," "GoodFellas" and, in
one of the biggest surprises of the year, "Ghost.";    The year's biggest hit,
"Home Alone," fared poorly with just two nominations for original score and
original song. The film, which opened in November, has collected $222.2
million to date.;    The eagerly awaited and heavily panned "Bonfire of the
Vanities" was blanked, and Robert Redford's fiasco "Havana" emerged with just
one nomination, for original score.;    Joining Costner for best actor
nominations were Robert De Niro for "Awakenings," Gerard Depardieu in "Cyrano
de Bergerac," Richard Harris in "The Field" and Jeremy Irons in "Reversal of
Fortune.";    Julia Roberts was named in the best actress category for her
depiction of a prostitute in the box office success, "Pretty Woman." Also
nominated in this category were Kathy Bates for "Misery," Angelica Huston for
"The Grifters," Meryl Streep in "Postcards From the Edge" and Joanne Woodward

Based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi, "GoodFellas" also dominated many
critics' Top 10 year-end lists.;    The National Board of Review selected
"Dances With Wolves" as 1990's best and picked "Cyrano de Bergerac" top
foreign-language film.;    At the Golden Globes, awarded in January, the top
winning films were "Dances With Wolves" and "Green Card.";    Each of the
Academy's branches votes for its peers. Actors nominate actors, directors
nominate directors, and so on. All members vote for best picture. Two hundred
and twenty three feature-length films were eligible this year.;    On Tuesday,
the Academy announced that it was presenting a special achievement award for
visual effects to the futuristic thriller "Total Recall.";    Comedian Billy
Crystal will be host of the awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium. Actress
Myrna Loy will receive an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement and comedian
Bob Hope will be among the evening's presenters. It will be Hope's 27th
appearance, an Oscar record.;    Security at this year's Oscar show could be
the toughest in history because of fears of terrorism stemming from the
Persian Gulf War.;    Guests will have to go through metal detectors to enter
an auditorium patrolled by bomb-sniffing dogs. Limousine drivers will face
strict credential rules.  </TEXT>

   The candidates all have appeared, and now the
movie world looks forward to a shootout between a Western pioneer
and two bands of modern-day gangsters for the Academy Awards.
   Will Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' be the winner?
Consensus thinking favors the epic of a cavalry officer who is
adopted by an Indian tribe. Hollywood admires Costner's courage to
fight for his film against heavy odds: Westerns are out of fashion,
one-third of the dialogue is subtitled, the film runs three hours.
   However, strong competition comes from ``GoodFellas,'' which
traces the rise and fall of a Brooklyn wiseguy. The Martin Scorsese
drama has been scoring with critics' circles awards in New York and
Los Angeles, less so with the ticket-buying public. After 98 days
in release, ``GoodFellas'' has collected a respectable but
unsensational $40 million.
   Paramount Picture's Christmas gift to Corleone fans, ``The
Godfather Part III,'' may also prove a strong contender. A victory
as best picture would provide an unbreakable record; the first two
``Godfathers'' won Hollywood's top prize.
   But more recent history seems to favor ``Dances With Wolves'' to
win as best picture of 1990. Academy voters have opted for
broadscale movies of courage and adventure: ``Ghandi,'' ``Chariots
of Fire,'' ``Out of Africa,'' ``Platoon,'' ``The Last Emperor.''
   Money alone doesn't sway the voters. There is little chance for
important awards for the $100 million-plus moneymakers of the year:
``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty
Woman,'' ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Home Alone,'' not to
mention ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Here's how the nominees for the 1990 Oscar race appear to this
observer:
   - Best Picture: ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The
Godfather Part III'' could be joined by a classic, ``Hamlet'' or
``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   Penny Marshall's ``Awakenings'' has a strong chance. On a more
frivolous note, ``Postcards From the Edge'' is a possibility.
Longshots include ``Avalon,'' ``The Grifters,'' ``The Sheltering
Sky,'' ``Reversal of Fortune.''
   - Best Actor: Kevin Costner's valiant Westerner seems a certain
nominee, along with Al Pacino's aging Michael Corleone of ``The
Godfather Part III.'' Robin Williams as the warm-hearted doctor in
``Awakenings'' and Jeremy Irons' cold-blooded Claus von Bulow of
``Reversal of Fortune'' also are likely. Robert De Niro could be
nominated for either ``GoodFellas'' or ``Awakenings.'' Longshots:
Danny Glover, ``To Sleep With Anger''; Gerard Depardieu, ``Cyrano
de Bergerac'' or ``Green Card''; Armin Mueller-Stahl, ``Avalon'';
Richard Harris, ``The Field''; Sean Connery, ``The Hunt for Red
October'' or ``The Russia House.''
   Best Actress: Two past winners figure strongly, Joanne Woodward
for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' and Anjelica Huston for ``The
Grifters'' or ``Witches.'' Susan Sarandon also seems likely for
``White Palace.'' Kathy Bates of ``Misery'' could be nominated in
this category or as supporting actress. Others: Meryl Streep and
Shirley MacLaine, ``Postcards From the Edge''; Mia Farrow,
``Alice''; Julia Roberts, ``Pretty Woman''; Michelle Pfeiffer,
``The Russia House.''
   Best Supporting Actor: Joe Pesci, ``GoodFellas''; Bruce Davison,
``Longtime Companion''; Andy Garcia, ``The Godfather Part III'';
Marlon Brando, ``The Freshman''; Graham Greene, ``Dances With
Wolves''; Hector Elizondo, ``Pretty Woman''; Al Pacino, ``Dick
Tracy''; Alan Arkin, ``Edward Scissorhands.''
   Best Supporting Actress: Dianne Wiest, ``Edward Scissorhands'';
Whoopi Goldberg, ``Ghost'' or ``The Long Walk Home''; Mary
McDonnell, ``Dances With Wolves''; Diane Ladd, ``Wild at Heart'';
Lorraine Bracco, ``GoodFellas''; Joan Plowright, ``Avalon.''
   Best Director: Kevin Costner, ``Dances With Wolves''; Martin
Scorsese, ``GoodFellas''; Francis Ford Coppola, ``The Godfather
Part III''; Penny Marshall, ``Awakenings''; Mike Nichols,
``Postcards From the Edge''; Barbet Schroeder, ``Reversal of
Fortune''; Franco Zeffirelli, ``Hamlet''; Peter Weir, ``Green
Card.''
   The above hopefuls will be culled when the Academy Award
nominations are announced in pre-dawn ceremonies on Feb. 13 in
Beverly Hills. The awards will be presented on March 25 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Dead Poets Society''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   John Keating is the kind of teacher of which every student
dreamed but rarely encountered. He tickles the ribs, he fires the
mind, he preaches nonconformity. He even instructs his pupils to
rip out the innocuous introduction from a book of poetry.
Obviously, John Keating isn't going to last at a rock-ribbed New
England prep school in the 1960s.
   Robin Williams portrays John Keating in ``Dead Poets Society''
with only a trace of Adrian Cronauer of ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
While trying to rouse his bored students, he demonstrates how
Shakespeare could be done by Marlon Brando and John Wayne.
Otherwise, he plays it straight-arrow, and he is wonderful.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' itself is wonderful, like a cool oasis
amid the arid summer of sequels. It is that rare comedy-drama that
stimulates the mind as well as the emotions.
   The title may be a turnoff for some folks, but it shouldn't be.
When Keating was a student at the school, he and other freethinkers
formed the society to read poetry and plot against the faculty.
Unbeknownst to him, his own students revive the custom in an
obvious collision course with the authorities.
   The film focuses more on the boys than on their teacher, and
they are portrayed with true insight. The central figure is Neil
Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), who yearns to be an actor despite his
father's stern opposition. Neil's roommate is Todd Anderson (Ethan
Hawke) who is so withdrawn he can't speak up in class.
   With their teacher's inspiration, Neil decides to defy his
father, and Todd comes out of his shell. There is a terrific scene
in which Williams forces Todd to recite a poem he had written. The
other boys in the cast are equally well drawn; they talk and behave
as you would expect rich boys of the period to.
   Australian Peter Weir, who captured the American scene in
``Witness,'' does it again in ``Dead Poets Society.'' His direction
of the young actors is brilliant, and he keeps Williams on a tight
rein. Tom Schulman's script is literate and clever, veering to the
ultimate tragedy. The ending may jar some viewers unless they note
the portents along the way.
   Robin Williams should be applauded not only for his performance
but for taking a role that is not a star turn in a film that may
have to hunt for an audience. A major factor in the film is John
Seale's gorgeous photography of the New England scene (actually
Delaware)
   A Touchstone Picture produced by Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt
and Tony Thomas, ``Dead Poet's Society'' is the biggest movie treat
of the year so far. Rated PG for language and intensity. Running
time: 126 minutes.

FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: More myth and power from Weir - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over and over a bird sings 'Far away and long ago' at the start of Blond
Eckbert. Like another woodbird in Wagner, she is introducing a tale of
murder and incest from the romantic world of German folk stories, where
huntsmen rove the forests and everybody fights through a dense undergrowth
of Freudian subtext - though there the similarities end.
It is a coincidence that there are two new operas concerned with the power
of myth in London at the moment. At Covent Garden Harrison Birtwistle's
Gawain is an epic on a monumental scale. Blond Eckbert by Judith Weir, given
its premiere by English National Opera on Wednesday, is shorter and sharper,
an evening that says what it wants to say and no more. Weir, after all, did
start with a 15-minute opera with a cast of one. She is not a composer who
likes to waste one's time.
On the face of it the plot is simplicity itself. (Weir has made her own
libretto from the original short story by the 19th-century Ludwig Tieck.)
Eckbert and Berthe, following on from the similarly-named Siegmund and
Sieglinde before them, are not only husband and wife, but brother and
sister. The climax of the tale is the revelation of this truth, but
tantalising shafts of light are shone into the characters' psyches along the
way.
Like the Birtwistle, Blond Eckbert is a story of self-discovery. Where
Gawain goes out into the world to explore who he is through a ritual series
of trials, Eckbert retreats within himself. He traces the roots of his
personality back to his childhood and what he finds is rejection
(definitely), child abuse (possibly) and a life of utter, inconsolable
loneliness.
This must sound awfully gloomy, yet the opera is anything but. Weir is a
quick-witted story-teller, who recounts events with a wry smile creeping
across her face. The music never takes two minutes to describe what it could
in one, sketching the characters deftly, painting the mood with a flick of
the brush, a few glinting colours enough to suggest the danger lurking in
the fairy-tale forest before the murder. The lightness of touch is
reminiscent of Stravinsky's Le Rossignol.
Perhaps one would like to feel a bit more for poor Eckbert. No matter how
much he suffers, the music refuses to get involved, leaving Nicholas Folwell
no channel through which to broadcast his feelings. He and Berthe, taken by
Anne-Marie Owens, remain the playthings of Weir's detached observations.
Three subsidiary characters were well taken by Christopher Ventris. Nerys
Jones's bird flew with more poise than she sang. All seemed reasonably
confident under Sian Edwards's musical direction.
The lesson that Weir has learnt from Britten among others is that the most
probing operas are often the simplest on the surface. Unfortunately Tim
Hopkins (producer) and Nigel Lowery (designer) seem to have set out asking,
'How shall we show that nothing you see in this opera is what it seems?'
'How about some film or some shadow puppets?' 'Or funny walks for the
characters?' 'Or zany drop-curtains and plenty of them?' 'No - it might be
boring. We'd better give them the whole lot'. And so they do.
When Blond Eckbert circulates, as it surely will (Santa Fe already has it
booked for this summer) it asks for a production with the same sleight of
hand as its composer's. Next time I would like to see the opera in a smaller
theatre, where every word can be heard, every nuance savoured. For those who
want to feast on new opera, Gawain is the main course, Blond Eckbert a
sorbet to cleanse the palette. Weir herself is well on course for an
operatic rosette.
Seven further performances at the London Coliseum ending May 18

<HEAD>THE OSCARS 1990: And the Winner Is ...</HEAD>
<HEAD>Cost of Pictures Means Little to Academy Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's proof that Academy voters pay little
heed to what a movie costs: One of the contenders for best picture
was produced for $3 million, another for $8 million.
   Contrast those figures with the $50 million spent on ``Batman,''
which earned one Academy Award nomination _ for art direction.
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has a history of
ignoring the cost factor in rewarding the best achievements of the
film world. ``Marty,'' with a budget of $343,000, won as best
picture of 1955, beating such big-budget films as ``Picnic,''
``Mister Roberts'' and ``Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.''
   The $1-million ``Rocky'' knocked out its rivals in 1976. Other
low-budget winners: ``Chariots of Fire,'' 1981, and ``Platoon,''
1986.
   Oscar loves the Cinderella story, and this year it stars the
Irish-made drama ``My Left Foot.''
   ``We managed to get the picture made out of blind ignorance,''
admits producer Noel Pearson. ``We were two weeks into filming when
we lined up the financing.'' He had been a close friend of the
film's subject, hard-drinking Christy Brown, who became an
acclaimed artist and writer in spite of the cerebral palsy that
virtually immobilized him.
   Pearson started the film with his own money, plus 100,000 pounds
sterling apiece from a friend and from Irish television. Everyone
concerned with the film, including star Daniel Day-Lewis, worked
for bare minimum. An art gallery scene was filmed in Pearson's own
house. He borrowed costumes from his theatrical company.
   ``The film was made for just under $3 million, depending on the
rate of exchange,'' said the producer. ``We managed to do that
because everybody was committed. It was triumph of spirit over
financing.'' The latest estimate for the worldwide gross of ``My
Left Foot'' _ $50 million.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' also demonstrates that a film's budget is
immaterial at awards time. It was budgeted at $8 million, amazing
in view of the $20 million average for mainstream Hollywood films.
   How could Richard and Lili Zanuck produce such an inexpensive
film? It is basically a two-character story and the two stars,
Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, are not high-priced. Dan Aykroyd
is, but he took a lesser salary to play the straight role of the
old woman's son. His change of character paid off with a nomination
for supporting actor.
   Australian Bruce Beresford directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' on
locations in and around Atlanta and the Zanucks tightly budgeted
the locations. The film, about the long relationship between a
cranky widow and her patient chauffeur, has proved a huge hit, both
in awards (nine Oscar nominations, the most this year), and at the
box office ($60.3 million after 12 weeks in release).
   Two other nominees for best picture had average budgets and drew
mixed reviews, but their off-beat subjects somehow connected with
the moviegoing public.
   ``Field of Dreams'' invited audiences to swallow a whopper: that
an Iowa farmer would build a baseball diamond in his cornfield
where long-dead major leaguers would play.
   Many critics spurned the fantasy, but ticket buyers were
attracted by its message of hope and the star power of Kevin
Costner. Filmed for a reported $16 million, ``Field of Dreams''
amassed a gross of $63 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' looked like an impossible sell. The title
seemed a turnoff. Although Robin Williams was a hot draw in the
wake of ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' he played a relatively brief
role as the English teacher who inspires students at a 1960s boys
school to think creatively. Most of the screen time in the $20
million film was devoted to the cast of unknown teen-agers.
   Reviewers objected to Williams as a latter-day Mr. Chips and
found the tragic ending out of keeping with the rest of the film.
But ``Dead Poets Society,'' directed by another Australian, Peter
Weir, sold $94 million in theater tickets.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' proved that film audiences are
still concerned with the consequences of the Vietnam war. The film
was the result of a long collaboration between Oliver Stone, whose
``Platoon'' was drawn from his own experiences in the war, and Ron
Kovic, wounded veteran and anti-war activist. Tom Cruise, one of
today's biggest draws in films, and strong reviews helped
contribute to the success of ``Born on the Fourth of July'' _ $59.7
million in 10 weeks.
   Stone directed the film in the Philippines, which doubled for
both Vietnam and Mexico, and Dallas, which represented Kovic's home
town of Massapequa, N.Y. Despite the complex production, which
ranged from battlefields to national political conventions with
12,000 extras, the cost was reportedly $18 million.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Weir and Britten in St Louis - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judith Weir's The Vanishing Bride groom had its American premiere in St
Louis this month. Scott Bergeson conducted. There was a pretty good young
cast. Francesca Zambello produced, and Alison Chitty designed; they stressed
the narrative plainness of the tales rather than the strangeness of the
actions related (a bridegroom lured into fairyland, a maiden wooed by the
devil). 'The magic,' Weir wrote of the Scottish folktale collection that was
her main source, 'lies in the tension between extraordinary stories and the
ordinary people who tell them.' There was little magic in the staging, but
much in the music.
This is an uncommonly skilful score - lucid, economical, cleverly designed,
imaginative in sound. Stravinsky inspires it; Messiaen and Britten lend
touches. What I missed at a first hearing was much emotional engagement;
perhaps that will emerge when the sheer dexterity of planning and writing no
longer dazzles.
The next day, Colin Graham's new pro duction of Britten's Midsummer Night's
Dream was electric. This opera's structure, too, is very carefully planned,
almost schematic in its motivic assignments of sonorities, harmonies, and
types of melodic motion. Yet it is not only the most beautiful of Britten's
scores but also - in such production as this - one of the most powerfully
affecting. Derek McClane's decor showed a world reversed: an upside-down
city skyline in the distance, trees descending from the flies. Glow-worms
glittered the stage. The lovely, enchanted wood could have been near Athens,
near London, or in New York, where Central Park has lately been the scene of
passionate murder and brutal rape.
Cruder modern stagings of the play, building crassly on Peter Brook's
vigorous and famous production, abjure prettiness, stress the
donkey-mounts-lady sexuality and the cruelty. Some productions of the opera,
on the other hand, have been merely decorative. Graham's holds the romantic
and the dark aspects in balance; after pangs as keen as those in Figaro, a
reconciliation equally moving is reached.
Robert Spano conducted a fine-grained instrumental performance. Derek Lee
Ragin was an exact and exquisite Oberon. There was an able young cast;
Thomas Barrett, as Bottom, was the outstanding singer. The Dream is less
often heard in this country than Albert Herring, The Turn of the Screw and
Death in Venice (while Peter Grimes and Billy Budd are the big-company
modern staples). This production should bring it forward in favour.
Graham, the artistic director of the company, has - in reaction against the
over-decoration of our day - commissioned a new, permanent back-wall for the
St Louis theatre. Before it, the actors are required to carry the burden of
the drama. 'Shakespeare had no scenery,' he writes, and 'many productions
that seem wonderfully exciting in the rehearsal room are compromised, even
wrecked, by the addition of scenery onstage.' Shakespeare, one might retort,
was not writing opera - that multi-media form of dramatic communication in
which decor has often been a essential element, one on which composers
counted.
The wall, designed by McClane, is a handsome, architecturally interesting
structure, built apparently of solid brick (though in fact of glass fibre).
It closed McClane's own Dream settings effectively. Miss Chitty veiled it
from view in the Bridegroom. It served Butterfly and Il Turco in Italia less
well, and I can imagine future designers finding it as intractable as the
Teatro Olimpico's handsome fixed set (built in 1585 for Oedipus) is for most
19th and 20th-century pieces.
*****
Butterfly was this year's standard opera, played nine times (against five
Bridegrooms and five Dreams). The Brescia score was used. Graham's
production was careful, but the principals, Guiping Deng and Rick Moon, did
not have pleasing voices, and Stephen Lord's conducting was summary. For
once, there was no Mozart; Rossini's 'Mozartian' Turco was given: the Turco
libretto, set by Seydelmann, played in Vienna in 1789 and evidently
influenced that of Cos fan tutte; Cos, in turn, played at La Scala in 1814
while Rossini was composing his version (with the Fiordiligi and Guglielmo
as his Fiorilla and Selim).
Little was Mozartian - or Rossinian - about the St Louis performance,
however. Since it was done in my English translation, I'll not review it.
Enough, perhaps, to report that the opera was presented as 'Prosdocimo's
Dream,' and that the rival ladies donned boxing gloves in the first-act
finale while the chorus erected a ring around them.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Two very good but very different movies from last year make their video debut 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) stars Robin Williams as an 
unconventional teacher at a private boys' school in 1959. Directed by Peter 
Weir, the funny and moving film shows -- as did "Stand and Deliver" -- how much 
difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13). You may be disappointed with the ending 
of this special-effects thriller, but chances are you'll enjoy the underwater 
trip that precedes it. Directed with dazzle by James Cameron ("The 
Terminator"). 
</P>
<P>
Other films fresh on tape: 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1957) and "Damn Yankees" (1958) both star Doris Day, both 
were co-directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, both feature exciting 
choreography by Bob Fosse, and both are colorful and lively versions of hit 
Broadway musicals. They're $59.95 each from Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964) gave Don Knotts his strangest role (yes, 
even stranger than Barney) as a bookkeeper who turns into a, gulp, fish -- who, 
gulp again, becomes a war hero. The whimsical mix of live action and animation 
is no "Mary Poppins," but pretty charming all the same. Also $59.95 from 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" (1988, PG-13), "The Music Teacher" (1988, PG) and "Murmur of the 
Heart" (1971, R) are three notable foreign films from Orion ($79.98 each). All 
three feature easy-to-read yellow captions. 
</P>
<P>
"Night Ambush" (VidAmerica, $39.98), originally released in Britain in 1956 as 
"Ill Met By Moonlight," a taut World War II thriller, was the last film on 
which the famous "Archers" team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger worked 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"The Keys to the Kingdom" (1944), "A Man Called Peter" (1955) and "The Story of 
Ruth" all featured big Hollywood budgets and plenty of emotional 
self-sacrificing in the name of religion (Christian, of course), but not much 
else to recommend them. They're $29.98 each from CBS/Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is a strong film depicting the battle baseball star 
Jimmy Piersall (Anthony Perkins) fought with mental illness. "Hell Is for 
Heroes" (1962) is a fairly decent WWII drama with Steve McQueen and Bobby 
Darin. Both are only $14.95 from Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"Cookie" (Warner, $89.95, R) is one of the two crumby "comedies" director Susan 
Seidelman blessed us with last year (the other was "She-Devil"). This one has 
Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk, Dianne Wiest and Brenda Vaccaro in the tale of a teen 
and her racketeer father. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has just released four volumes containing two "Twilight Zone" episodes 
each. These are the original, b&amp;w shows from the '50s and '60s, introduced 
by Rod Serling. Each volume sells for $14.98. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all, folks. MGM/UA has some more hourlong collections of those 
fantastic Warner Bros. cartoons from the '30s and '40s: "Daffy Duck and 
Company," "Porky Pig and Company" and "Bugs Vs. Elmer." They're $14.95 each.

<HEAD>THE OSCARS 1990: And the Winner Is ...</HEAD>
<HEAD>Actor Oscar Nominees Played Diverse Characters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disabled Marine, an old woman's chauffeur,
a cerebral palsy victim, an English teacher and a king of England _
these are the widely divergent characterizations nominated by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the best
performance by an actor in 1989.
   Rarely has the Oscar race offered such a range of portrayals,
making perilous any predictions of the winner on March 26. Daniel
Day-Lewis and Tom Cruise have been termed the favorites, but it's
still anybody's guess.
   An Oscar for Cruise would reward a star who is already on top of
the Hollywood heap. After four smash hits in a row _ ``The Color of
Money,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Rain Man''_ he is the
actor studios want most.
   Cruise took a chance with ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
devoting painful months to portray Ron Kovic, the paraplegic
Vietnam veteran who became an anti-war activist.
   ``Tom worked for nothing for 18 months to make this picture
happen,'' says director Oliver Stone. ``He came from the same
background as Ron: working class, Catholic upbringing. He was
motivated by the same desires to be the best at what he does, to be
a champion.''
   In an interview Cruise said of his role: ``I'd like people to
see that Kovic is not simply a victim. Instead, he creates his life
every day in the face of more difficulty than most of us have
experienced. That was crucial for me to understand: that we have to
fight back when we meet adversity.''
   Christy Brown's adversity seemed insuperable. Born into a large,
poor Dublin family, his cerebral palsy made control of his body
impossible _ except for his left foot. Yet he managed to become an
acclaimed artist and writer.
   Daniel Day-Lewis, last seen as the libertine surgeon in ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' undertook the punishing role in
``My Left Foot.'' The son of a one-time poet laureate of England
and an actress, Day-Lewis spent time in a Dublin clinic studying
how children with cerebral palsy coped with their handicaps.
   ``It became very important to me that it didn't become a film
about a supposedly able-bodied actor taking on the physical
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man,'' the actor says.
``That seemed to me of secondary importance.''
   Morgan Freeman, who won an Academy nomination as supporting
actor with his vicious pimp in ``Street Smart,'' plays a far
different role in ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' He is the patient,
understanding chauffeur for a cantankerous Southern Jewish woman,
Jessica Tandy. Freeman, who spent his early years in Greenwood,
Miss., had no trouble understanding the role of a black man in the
postwar South.
   ``Having grown up in the South, I knew this man,'' he said. ``I
don't think of him as being `subservient.' You live in a certain
society, and that society has rules, and you abide by them. You can
always do that with a certain amount of dignity.''
   Freeman had the advantage of originating the role of Hoke in the
off-Broadway version of Alfred Uhry's play. ``This character was
totally realized on paper,'' Freeman remarks. ``There was little
for me to do but slip into it and do it.''
   For Kenneth Branagh, having played ``Henry V'' in the theater
was a distinct advantage. He was directing as well as starring in
the film version.
   ``Since I had already played the role with the Royal Shakespeare
Company,'' says the Belfast-born Branagh, ``it was in the blood.
When I did a take, it was like a release; all I had to do was be
the character. I could use the medium as spontaneously as if Henry
was a modern figure.
   ``As soon as I finished the take, I had to face questions about
the costumes, the lighting and whatever. If I had not been familiar
with the role, it would have been terrifying.''
   ``Dead Poets Society'' provided an ideal vehicle for Robin
Williams, allowing him to use his quicksilver wit within the
context of a drama. He plays John Keating, a teacher who cajoles
the students at a 1960s boys school to unshackle their
imaginations. The film was entirely different when presented to
Williams by director Peter Weir.
   ``The first draft had the whole thing where Keating was dying of
cancer and that's why he was coming back and doing one last good
deed before he died,'' the actor said in an interview. ``It would
be real melodramatic that way, like `Love Story.' It was too much.
Let's focus on the boys, let's make their story stronger. And
(Weir) did just that.
   ``It's not about one man against the system. ... It's about one
man coming with some ideas and boys taking them and going off in
every direction.''
   Williams' suggestion cut down his role to what some actors would
consider a supporting part. But the impact of his personality was
strong enough to prompt academy voters to give him a second
nomination as best actor. His first was for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' in 1987.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Arts: Syncopated Weir - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The special attraction in Susan Tomes's recital, at the Wigmore on
Wednesday, was a piece newly written for her by Judith Weir. Miss Weir is of
course the teasing composer of A Night at the Chinese Opera and many other
quirky things - among them, no doubt, her forthcoming Blond Eckbert for the
English National Opera. Miss Tomes is the pianist of the excellent Domus
trio, which boasts two Weir pieces in its repertoire.
In the new piano piece, called The King of France, Weir seems to have
remembered the Tomes penchant for Billy Mayerl: there were strong hints of
that toward the end of it. But her guiding inspiration was an ancient
Sephardic Jewish song, 'El Rey de Francia'; in fact The King is a set of 10
variations on it. The tune has a plangent ring and intriguing curves,
variously exploited and developed in the variations.
Often there are rude, syncopated basses; oddly fractured Weir(d)
piano-textures, too, and one big variation - grave and searching, with
sharply struck chords that linger on - with a kind of post-Romantic
eloquence. Some brusque transitions puzzled. I imagine that Miss Tomes will
be delivering The King of France with more persuasive confidence in a month
or two.
She was not really at her best on Wednesday. Her Mozart, the late, lovely
B-flat Sonata K. 570, was clean and alert, and the ornaments glittered, but
the whole seemed a touch self-effacing. There were excellent things in her
three Faure nocturnes, not least the unshakeable Tomes pulse, and yet the
tunes often sang too shyly to emerge from the figuration. She took the Third
Nocturne well below Faure's tempo, at some cost to its dance-spring and its
winsomeness, and in the little Eighth Nocturne the soft scales that wind
around the melody were not soft, but distractingly bright.
In spite of the evident affection and care that she lavished on Schubert's
great A major sonata, D959, it was not a very happy performance. The
sparkling Scherzo, at least, is right up the Tomes alley; but the Andantino
was wan, and the Finale sadly tame, without the energy to make the closing
teases even begin to work. The strenuous passages in the first two movements
sounded like hard, anxious work. A devoted audience applauded her anyway.

   The bittersweet ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' carried off a leading nine Academy Award nominations
Wednesday as Oscar voters passed over box-office blockbusters and
maverick movies with equal abandon.
   ``Daisy,'' which traces the relationship over the decades
between a testy Jewish widow and her tolerant black chauffeur in
the South, drew nominations for best picture and actors Morgan
Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to unselfish
protest by way of a Vietnam injury that left him a paraplegic, got
eight nominations, including best picture.
   Also nominated in the top picture category by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were ``Dead Poets Society,''
``Field of Dreams'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   ``This is truly one of the happiest and most triumphant moments
of my life,'' said Kovic.
   Among other multiple nominees, ``Glory,'' a look at an all-black
regiment in the Civil War, and ``My Left Foot,'' the story of an
indomitable Irish artist with cerebral palsy, each earned five
nominations.
   ``The Abyss,'' ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' ``Dead
Poets Society'' and ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' grabbed four
nominations each.
   Oscar voters largely ignored many of the year's highest-grossing
titles, as ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,''
``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's
Talking'' captured only five nominations combined.
   A number of modestly budgeted, independently minded efforts also
were given short shrift, including the critically embraced
``Drugstore Cowboy,'' which was shut out.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' while landing on numerous critics' Top
10 lists, snared just two nominations, and ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' one of the best-received independent films of the
decade, generated just one.
   For the second time in two years, Academy voters did not
nominate the year's most acclaimed documentary. ``Roger &amp; Me,''
filmmaker Michael Moore's satirical perspective on General Motors
and the people of Flint, Mich., was overlooked.
   In 1989, the Academy did not nominate Errol Morris' ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' the movie which set convicted murderer Randall Dale
Adams free.
   The awards will be presented on March 26. The show will be seen
on ABC.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' was nominated for Tom Cruise's
lead performance as Kovic, for adapted screenplay, for Stone's
direction, cinematography, editing, original score and sound.
   Joining Freeman and Cruise in the race for best actor were
Kenneth Branagh, the star, director and adaptor of Shakespeare's
``Henry V,'' Daniel Day-Lewis, who played artist Christy Brown in
``My Left Foot,'' and comedian Robin Williams, as an unconventional
teacher in a very conventional school in ``Dead Poets Society.''
   Isabelle Adjani, featured in France's ``Camille Claudel'' as an
impassioned sculptress, was perhaps the most surprising nominee for
best actress.
   Miss Adjani will compete against Miss Tandy, who played the
widow Miss Daisy; Pauline Collins, who starred as a frustrated
British housewife who finds happiness on a Greek isle in ``Shirley
Valentine''; Jessica Lange, who defends an alleged Nazi war
criminal who also is her father in ``Music Box,'' and Michelle
Pfeiffer, the chanteuse of ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   British stage star Branagh joins a select list of Oscar nominees
by being recognized for both starring in and directing ``Henry V.''
Woody Allen (``Annie Hall''), Warren Beatty (``Heaven Can Wait,''
``Reds'') and Orson Welles (``Citizen Kane'') are among the few who
have shared the dual acting-directing recognition for the same film.
   In addition to Branagh, the nominees for best director were
Stone for ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Peter Weir for ``Dead Poets Society'' and Jim
Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   Belying a tradition that films released late in the year are
favored in the Oscars, ``Field of Dreams'' was released April 21
and ``Dead Poets Society'' June 2.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' writer and director Phil Alden Robinson's
magical tale of a man who rediscovers the past on a Iowa baseball
field, also was nominated for best adapted screenplay.
   ``We got letters from people saying the film had changed their
lives, that it had brought families back together. We couldn't have
asked for more than that,'' Robinson said.

   William Morris
   Makes Changes

   LOS ANGELES -- William Morris Agency, which has had a mass
exodus of clients and top agents in recent weeks, announced a
series of top-level executive changes designed to bolster its
ranks from within the agency.
   Jerry Katzman, formerly executive vice president,
world-wide head of television, was named president. He
succeeds Norman Brokaw, who continues as chief executive
officer and assumes the additional post of chairman from Lou
Weiss. Mr. Weiss will serve as chairman emeritus and continue
to be in charge of New York operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some in the industry had expected the Hollywood talent
agency to bring in an outside powerhouse to take the helm.
"They need to do something that will make a statement," one
studio head said. "They need a very big change."
   Recently five top agents left William Morris, four to join
rival International Creative Management. William Morris also
has lost roughly 20 clients to ICM, including major stars
such as actresses Julia Roberts, Angelica Houston and Andie
MacDowell.
   Industry executives have whispered that ICM, in its effort
to compete with Creative Artists Agency, has been raiding the
ranks of William Morris by offering agents significantly
higher salaries. In winning the agents, the agency frequently
wins their prestigious clients as well.
   But William Morris also lost an agent, John Ptak, to
Creative Artists yesterday. It isn't yet clear whether his
clients, including actor Gerald Depardieu and director Peter
Weir, will follow.
   "They are losing a lot of their motion picture
department," one agent said.
   William Morris yesterday attempted to downplay the exodus
from its ranks. "This kind of thing has gone on for years.
This is nothing new. ICM has lost quite a few people over the
past few years, and people have left CAA, despite the rumors
that no one leaves," said Larry Auerbach, executive vice
president of William Morris.
   Mr. Auerbach also said he doesn't believe the rumor that
ICM is winning William Morris agents by doubling their
salaries. However, he says, "in some cases the salaries have
reached quite a high level."

Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in "sex, lies, and videotape," 
flinches at the possibility of becoming a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my family. 
</P>
<P>
And it would be terrible not to be able to because of fame," MacDowell said in 
the November issue of Glamour magazine. 
</P>
<P>
MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in "Greystoke," 
lives in a Victorian house in Upstate New York with her husband, model Paul 
Qualley; son Justin, 4, and daughter Rainey, 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
If she weren't an actress, she said, she would be "a mother and a gardener." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to broccoli, to corn 
to sunflowers," she said.

She has two new movies coming out soon: "The Object of Beauty" with John 
Malkovich and "Green Card" with Gerard Depardieu.

<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Since the Oscar race is, for all intents and purposes, a closed affair
(open only to dues-paying Academy members who vote in their respective
categories and for best picture), each studio's mission is clear: Bug or
impress as many voting members as possible in the hopes that they'll select
your picture, your star, your director to be among those nominees announced
Wednesday at a sunrise affair in Beverly Hills.;    The campaigning, as usual,
runs the gamut from extravagant to absurd. Such pictures as "Hamlet,"
"Postcards from the Edge," "Reversal of Fortune" and "Avalon" may have it for
sheer number of ads. Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company takes it
for chutzpah. Would you believe it's pushing "Arachnophobia" for best picture,
best actor (Jeff Daniels) and best supporting actor (John Goodman)?;    Not to
be outdone in the pie-in-the-sky department, Disney is pushing Tom Selleck as
best actor ("Three Men and a Little Lady"), 20th Century Fox has flagged
little Macaulay Culkin ("Home Alone") and Bruce Willis ("Die Hard 2"), and
Tri-Star wants no one to forget Arnie Schwarzenegger's sensitive work (in
"Total Recall").;    Why, there's even a full-page testimonial to Robert
Redford in the year's biggest stiff, a little something called "Havana.";   
To be fair, studios are often contractually obliged to take out ads singing
their clients' praises. That came out when Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman
asked Columbia Pictures not to mount a promised campaign for "Ishtar.";    The
year's most prophetic ad? A silhouette of a tired, spiritually depleted Al
Pacino as Michael Corleone in "The Godfather, Part III." The ad is meant to
remind Academy members to vote as they did in '72 and '74 and make "III" a
best-picture contender. It could backfire. It could remind members how
sluggishly the Francis Coppola saga performed at the box office.;    Not all
the studio hype is worthless. It augurs well for Wednesday's finalists that
Sidney Lumet's "Q&amp;A" is getting a big push (particularly Nick Nolte's
rogue-cop lead). Other pleasant surprises: Miramax's ad for Paul Newman's
anything-but-lovable father in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge"; Samuel Goldwyn's
campaign for Bruce Davison in "Longtime Companion" (spurred on, no doubt, by
Davison's Golden Globe and critics' circles wins); and Cinecom's belief in
Peter Falk as a supporting actor possible for "Tune in Tomorrow." (While we'd
love to pat Columbia on the back for standing by Annie Potts in Peter
Bogdanovich's hastily dismissed "Texasville," the studio's logo is nowhere to
be found on the ad, leading us to presume Potts or Bogdanovich financed the
reminder.);    All told, there are 223 features eligible to be nominated
Wednesday. To qualify, you needed to project your film on a Los Angeles County
screen for seven consecutive days. And it had to be shown in 35mm or 70mm and
have opened prior to midnight, Dec. 31.;    So how will the Academy vote in
the preliminary round (Oscars will be awarded March 25)?;    As usual, you can
expect it to favor the year's prestige productions. Translation: "Reversal of
Fortune," "Dances with Wolves," "Avalon," "Hamlet," and "The Hunt for Red
October" will emerge multiple nominees. And just to prove they don't ignore
the critics, Academy voters will also remember -- in the best-picture category
-- the icily beautiful "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" and the hilariously dark
"GoodFellas.";    So who would we back, were we given the vote?;    Glad you
asked. Here are our picks in the major categories. Remember, these are the
films and talents we think should be nominated, not those that will in fact
get the nod.; (box) Best Picture;    (check) "Dances with Wolves";    (check)
"After Dark, My Sweet";    (check) "Vincent &amp; Theo";    (check) "Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge";    (check) "GoodFellas";    Don't expect to find Robert Altman's
portrait of the tormented Vincent van Gogh or James Foley's modern-day film
noir, "After Dark," in this category; the Academy will go with "Hamlet,"
"Cyrano de Bergerac," "Reversal of Fortune" or "Avalon." The year's cash cows
"Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" will be slighted. Ditto Coppola's new Corleone
saga.; (box) Best Actor;    (check) Nick Nolte ("Q&amp;A");    (check) Danny
Glover ("To Sleep with Anger");    (check) Jeremy Irons ("Reversal of
Fortune");    (check) Jason Patric ("After Dark, My Sweet");    (check) Gerard
Depardieu ("Cyrano");    Oscar sometimes surprises us and smiles on subtitled
performances. France's much-revered Depardieu has an excellent shot in this
category. So, too, do Irons and Nolte. Glover, who gave the year's best
performance by an American actor, will be overlooked because no one saw "To
Sleep with Anger." Patric's exceptional work as a punchy patsy was too
downbeat to score votes. Al Pacino ("Godfather III"), Sean Connery ("The
Russia House"), Robin Williams and Robert De Niro (both in "Awakenings") have
been longtime Academy favorites and could be this year as well.; (box) Best
Actress;    (check) Jessica Lange ("Men Don't Leave");    (check) Laura Dern
("Wild at Heart");    (check) Mia Farrow ("Alice");    (check) Joanne Woodward
("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Helen Mirren ("The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife &amp; Her Lover");    What's shaping up as the year's most interesting race
will be decided by the Glenn Close-Meryl Streep Factor. Will Close again luck
out with a supporting turn and be nominated for "Hamlet" or "Reversal of
Fortune"? Will Streep make the cut with her breezy performance in "Postcards
From the Edge?" Dern and Mirren aren't even in the running; Kathy Bates
("Misery"), Anjelica Huston ("The Grifters") and Michelle Pfeiffer ("The
Russia House") are. Only Woodward, who won in 1957 for "The Three Faces of
Eve," is a sure thing -- to be nominated, and indeed to cart off the trophy.;
(box) Best Supporting Actor;    (check) Bruce Dern ("After Dark, My Sweet");  
 (check) Fred Ward ("Miami Blues");    (check) Alan Arkin ("Edward
Scissorhands");    (check) Graham Greene ("Dances with Wolves");    (check)
Jon Polito ("Miller's Crossing");    Once again, an embarrassment of riches in
this category. Only Greene, we predict, will make Oscar's cut. He'll be joined
by Ron Silver ("Reversal of Fortune"), Andy Garcia ("Godfather III's" best
hope for a win), Peter Falk ("Tune in Tomorrow"), Joe Mantegna ("Alice"), Al
Pacino ("Dick Tracy") or -- the two favorites -- Bruce Davison ("Longtime
Companion") and Joe Pesci ("GoodFellas").; (box) Best Supporting Actress;   
(check) Lorraine Bracco ("GoodFellas");    (check) Glenn Close ("Reversal of
Fortune");    (check) Billie Whitelaw ("The Krays");    (check) Winona Ryder
("Mermaids");    (check) Dianne Wiest ("Edward Scissorhands");    This is
where Close belongs, but if she lands here, she'll muddy Bracco's inside
track. Madonna ("Dick Tracy") should be a strong contender, but won't be;
Shirley MacLaine ("Postcards From the Edge") shouldn't be a finalist, but will
be. Academy members will take care of the "Ghost" conundrum (it made money but
isn't very good) by nominating Whoopi Goldberg's flustered spiritualist.;
(box) Best Director;    (check) Kevin Costner ("Dances with Wolves");   
(check) Martin Scorsese ("GoodFellas");    (check) James Foley ("After Dark,
My Sweet");    (check) James Ivory ("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Robert
Altman ("Vincent &amp; Theo");    This category always brings controversy when a
best-film nominee's director is overlooked. The Academy will go with Costner,
Scorsese and Ivory, and replace Foley and industry maverick Altman with Barbet
Schroeder ("Reversal of Fortune"), Coppola ("Godfather III"), previous winner
Barry Levinson ("Avalon") or Franco Zeffirelli ("Hamlet"). The statue, we all
know, belongs at long last to Scorsese, but few will complain if Costner pulls
an upset.; (box) Best Original Screenplay;    (check) Bruce Joel Rubin
("Jacob's Ladder");    (check) Philip Ridley ("The Krays");    (check) Peter
Weir ("Green Card");    (check) Andrew Bergman ("The Freshman");    (check)
Peter Greenaway ("The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover");    Academy
members have their work cut out for them here. Most of last year's best films
were pulled from books or plays. They'll probably nominate Joel Rubin's lesser
"Ghost," Woody Allen's inconsequential "Alice," Levinson's self-promotional
"Avalon" and J.F. Lawton's severely gutted "Pretty Woman."; (box) Best
Screenplay Adaptation;    (check) Nicholas Pileggi, Martin Scorsese
("GoodFellas");    (check) Charles Burnett ("To Sleep with Anger");    (check)
Michael Blake ("Dances with Wolves");    (check) Ruth Prawer Jhabvala ("Mr.
and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of Fortune");    The
big contenders here will probably be William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen
King's "Misery," Frank Pierson's and Alan Pakula's uninspired "Presumed
Innocent" and Carrie Fisher's trivialization of her own best-selling
"Postcards From the Edge." Tom Stoppard's ingenious reworking of John le
Carre's "The Russia House" also will be nominated.; (box) Best Cinematography;
   (check) Vittorio Storaro ("The Sheltering Sky");    (check) Dean Semler
("Dances with Wolves");    (check) Jean Lepine ("Vincent &amp; Theo");    (check)
Michael Ballhaus ("GoodFellas");    (check) Gordon Willis ("The Godfather,
Part III");    Whether Storaro is nominated for his work on "The Sheltering
Sky" or "Dick Tracy" will say a lot about the mood of the Academy. Will they
favor comic-strip escapism or artfully rendered landscapes? No one will
quibble about Semler's inclusion for the majestic "Dances," but Lepine will be
overlooked in favor of either Pierre Lhomme ("Cyrano") or Oliver Stapleton
("The Grifters"). If Willis is snubbed, Coppola and company can stay home
Oscar night.; (box) Best Score;    (check) Gabriel Yared ("Vincent &amp; Theo");  
 (check) Ryuichyi Sakamoto ("The Sheltering Sky");    (check) Elmer Bernstein
("The Grifters");    (check) Jerry Goldsmith ("The Russia House");    (check)
Richard Robbins ("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    Danny Elfman also is in the
running for "Edward Scissorhands" and "Dick Tracy." He'll be nominated for
"Edward S." because the flatfooted fantasy didn't perform as expected at the
box office. Jean-Claude Petit could also be a nominee, provided the Academy
decides to treat "Cyrano" as it did Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny &amp; Alexander" and
allow it to break out of the confining foreign-language category.; (box) Best
Foreign Language Film;    (check) "Ay, Carmela!" (Spain);    (check) "Song of
Exile" (Taiwan);    (check) "Cyrano de Bergerac" (France);    (check) "The
Nasty Girl" (Germany);    (check) "Taxi Blues" (USSR);    Why these titles
among the record 37 submitted from around the globe? Simple. They received the
most press and festival display.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
The family ties which have bound the descendants of George and James Weir to
Scotland's biggest and most successful engineering company for more than a
century are slowly unravelling. George Weir, a 52-year-old great grandson,
has retired after 20 years on The Weir Group board, leaving his brother,
Viscount Weir, 59, as the sole remaining member of the family involved in
the business. Viscount Weir has been chairman since 1972, apart from a brief
gap in the early 1980s when the company ran into financial problems and Lord
Tombs took the chair.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 15m overseas work for Weir
Pumps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR PUMPS has been awarded four orders worth Pounds 15m from the oil
industry in the Middle East, India and Canada.
The biggest order has been placed by ADCO (Abu Dhabi Co) for three on-shore
oilfields in the United Arab Emirates.
Weir will supply 28 multi-stage horizontal split-casing water injection
pumps and 29 Mather and Platt motors. The pumps will be made from special
austenitic stainless steel, cast in-house at the Manchester foundry.
The company will also provide 21 pumpsets to the Bab field, three to Bu-Hasa
and four to Sahil.
Elsewhere in the Gulf, Kuwait Oil has ordered four firewater pumps for the
Mina-Al-Ahmadi refinery.
In India, Weir is to supply all the major pumping equipment to ONGC Neelan's
offshore development under a deal signed with Korean contractor Hyundai
Heavy Industries.
The job involves 14 units spread over four ranges, including five seawater
injection pumps.
In Canada, Weir will provide three seawater injection skids to the Hibernia
project offshore Newfoundland.

<DATELINE> TUCSON, Ariz.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona Commerce Bank said that Thomas C. Weir resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer effective Sept. 30. 

   Mr. Weir said in a statement that he is resigning to take another job, but he declined to identify his new employer. 

   The bank said its directors "will meet soon" to decide upon a successor for Mr. Weir. 

   The posts of president and chief executive of Arizona Commerce have had some unusual turnover this year. 

   In March, Donald B. Anderson Jr., who had held the posts since August 1986, resigned for personal reasons. 
In April, the bank named Joseph A. Mano III as Mr. Anderson's successor. 
But Mr. Mano's appointment was withdrawn before he could take office because, acording to Mr. Weir, Mr. Mano hadn't disclosed the circumstances under which he left his previous job with a Northern California bank. 

   Mr. Weir, who had held only the post of chairman, was named to the additional jobs of president and chief executive in May.

<LEADPARA>  The San Jose Police Department is turning high-tech up another notch with the
introduction of a hand-held computer that may change the way officers write
their reports.;    Instead of using pencils and paper, police soon will be
able to flip open a battery-run gadget that resembles the Etch-A-Sketch
children's toy to enter reports on a computer screen, according to Officer
Tony Weir, of the department's Systems Development Unit.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  S.J. COPS TO GET HIGH-TECH ASSISTANT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's Etch-A-Sketch with a brain," Weir said.;    San Jose -- which 15
years ago was among the first departments to put computer terminals in police
cars -- will be the first law enforcement agency in the country to experiment
with the device, called a Grid Pad.;    Later this month, the department will
start a nine-month pilot project to test the Grid Pad -- an IBM PC-compatible
rig that allows officers to write reports directly on a screen with a pen or
stylus. The reports are stored on a small memory card in the Grid Pad, which
then converts an officer's handwriting into typed form. The information can
later be printed out.;    The hand-held pad is the first step in a proposed
new records-keeping system that eventually may include a main-frame computer
to store and process police information.;    Under the fully equipped "record
management process," explained Weir, officers would remove the memory cards
from their Grid Pad at the end of the day and place them in the main computer,
which would index and distribute reports.;    Given the time and manpower it
now takes to compile and process reports by hand, Weir said, the pad's $3,200
price tag may prove well worth the expense.;    "This," said Weir, "could
reduce all of that to a matter of minutes.";    During the first weeks of the
demonstration project, some desk officers will use the Grid Pads to record
minor incidents and missing persons reports from residents who come to the
police administration building. Later on, a few officers in the field will use
the pads to record offenses and accidents and to issue citations.;    Since
the department does not yet have a main-frame computer, Weir said, the Grid
Pad will be plugged into a laser printer, which will kick out paper copies of
reports.;    Designed and manufactured by the Grid Systems Corp. of Fremont,
the Grid Pad has been in production for about a year. It is now being tried by
some airline companies and a supermarket chain, said Weir, in addition to San
Jose police.  </TEXT>
