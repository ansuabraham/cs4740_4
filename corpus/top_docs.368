   The United States has no plans to send
military forces to Trinidad, where Prime Minister Arthur Robinson
and more than 30 others are being held hostage by Moslem rebels,
the State Department said today.
   At the same time, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher criticized
Libya's involvement with the rebels, saying it has provided some
training for the insurgents. But he said there was no apparent
direct link between Libya and the hostage-taking, which occurred
last Friday.
   Boucher refused comment on reports that U.S. military assets
were being deployed in the vicinity of Trinidad but said ``there
are no plans for U.S. military intervention.''
   The USS Roosevelt paid a scheduled visit to Port-of-Spain July
20-23, the Navy said. The carrier is now in port in Norfolk. The
Navy has 10 ships in the Caribbean on what the Navy calls ``routine
exercises.''
   Boucher said there have been no reports of injury to the
estimated 6,000 Americans living in Trinidad.
   President Bush was keeping up to date on developments after
returning to Washington late Sunday after a weekend at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We fully support the government of Prime Minister (Arthur)
Robinson and hope for a peaceful solution to the situation there,''
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   U.S. officials said any direct U.S. role had been all but ruled
out. Even sending U.S. experts on hostage negotiations _ discussed
informally on Saturday between the United States and
representatives of the Trinidad government _ had been ruled out,
sources said.
   ``The Trinidadians would like to find a solution on their own
without any outside assistance. They'd just rather settle it
themselves,'' the official said.
   The administration has hailed Trinidad's government as a model
of democracy, and the attempted coup was viewed with distress in
Washington.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
late Friday by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and
capturing Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Angus Khan, the ambassador from Trinidad and Tobago to the
United States, said the negotiations between his government and the
``terrorists over the release of the hostages are very delicate.''
He refused to say more.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A black Moslem leader said his
rebels captured Prime Minister Arthur Robinson and his Cabinet in
the Parliament building Friday, and claimed to have toppled the
government of this southern Caribbean nation.
   But government radio early today broadcast a condemnation of the
uprising and said police had moved into the streets of the capital
to bring order in this mainly Catholic and Hindu country. There
were no immediate reports of casualties.
   The attack on Parliament came Friday as the capital's police
headquarters was blown up and explosions and gunfire were heard in
the direction of the government's television station, which the
rebels seized.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' leader Abu Bakr of
Jamaat al-Muslimeen, Arabic for the Moslem Group, said on
government television.
   He promised ``free and fair'' elections within 90 days in
Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony of 1.3 million people
on two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The country has a
1,500-member army and a 5,000-member police force.
   British West Indies Airways and American Airlines canceled
commercial flights into Trinidad Friday evening, but the Piarco
International Airport remained under control of government security
forces.
   The National Broadcasting Service's Radio 610, the government
radio station, said Robinson and his Cabinet were being held in the
Red House, the Parliament building across the street from the
central police station.
   Radio 610 said the police station was blown up and burned out of
control for hours. Announcer Dennis McComie said no one attempted
to put out the fire and there were several explosions of what he
assumed was ammunition in the station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at 6 p.m. to announce the
uprising by Jamaat al-Muslimeen.
   In Washington, State Department Spokesman Dave Denny said, ``We
would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
Trinidad.''
   Denny said the U.S. Embassy had reported gunfire and explosions
in the vicinity of the TV station, which is several miles northwest
of the parliamentary building, but only a few blocks below the
hillside Hilton Hotel.
   Denny said he had no word about the situation of Americans in
Trinidad and Tobago. The smaller island of Tobago is a popular
vacation site.
   Bakr said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians.
   Acting President Emmanuel Carter told Radio 610 that people
should pray for a solution to the situation.
   ``Stay at home and let the protected (police) forces do their
jobs,'' he said.
   McComie said at 3 a.m. today that there had been some looting
and police had moved into the streets for the first time since the
country's leading officials were seized.
   Radio 610 broadcast a statement from David Coore, Jamaican
foreign affairs minister, deploring the uprising. His comments were
heard on Radio 610 on a relay from Radio Jamaica.
   ``We call urgently and directly on those responsible for this
totally unacceptable situation to release the hostages
unconditionally and pursue whatever complaints they have by the
regular processes of constitutional democracy which are the
hallmark of our Caribbean Community,'' Coore said.
   Caribbean heads of state and their ministers were to meet this
weekend in the Jamaican capital of Kingston for the annual meeting
the Caribbean common market. Trinidad Foreign Affairs Minister
Sahadeo Basdeo is in Kingston.
   It could not be ascertained how many ministers were taken
hostage with Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, is a former Trinidad policeman and has
been arrested several times in the past on charges of contempt of
court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of Port-of-Spain. Members of the
sect, founded in 1980, are widely perceived in Trinidad as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   Abu Bakr has said he doesn't recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   In November of 1988, police raided the sect's sanctuary and
seized weapons and ammunition. Bakr said then he was waging a war
against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding. Trinidad published reports say Abu
Bakr has visited Libya.
   Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain in 1962. It
is an English-speaking country with a large populace from India.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindu. Only about 6 percent are Moslem, most of them East Indians.
There is great tension between the black and Indian Moslems.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by Libya.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem militants said they
captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in the Parliament
building on Friday in this Caribbean capital. There were reports of
gunfire and explosions in the city.
   Abu Bakr, head of the black rebel group, said in a nationwide
radio and TV broadcast late Friday that the government was toppled.
The claim could not be independently confirmed.
   Earlier, Bakr had a station newscaster read a statement on
national television about 6 p.m. EDT in which Bakr announced the
uprising by the group Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which is Arabic for the
Group of Moslems. He claimed to be holding captive in Parliament
the prime minister, Arthur Robinson.
   An announcer on Radio 610, Dennis McComie, quoted Bakr as having
said on TV that ``the government has been overthrown'' and promised
elections within 90 days. Bakr did not mention what he had done
with the prime minister and his Cabinet.
   Bakr was quoted as saying his motive for moving against the
government was ``poverty and the destruction of Trinidad. ... We
will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no hope
for the present regime to stop.''
   There has been no official reaction from the government but late
Friday in Washington, State Department spokesman Dave Denny said,
``We would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic
government of Trinidad.''
   He also said, ``Our embassy reports gunfire in the vicinity of
the TV station. Explosions and gunfire have been heard downtown.''
   There were unconfirmed reports of casulaties in this city of
300,000 residents though Denny said he had no word about the
situation of Americans in Trinidad. Trinidad's smaller island of
Tobago is a popular vacation site.
   Bakr said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians, McComie told The Associated Press.
   The Moslem group claims to have 200 to 250 members. They are
known as a small militant group with connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding.
   The rebel statement said the Cabinet also was being held hostage
with Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist, but it could not be ascertained how many were inside the
Parliament building.
   Trinidad's ambassador to the United States told CBS Radio in
Washington that Robinson and the entire Cabinet, which had been
meeting at the time, were believed in the custody of the rebels.
   A radio station in Trinidad, government-owned National
Broadcasting Service, said that police headquarters in downtown
Port-of-Spain also had been blown up Friday by the rebels. The
rebels are based in St. James, outside the capital, and near police
headquarters.
   McComie said the central police station was on fire and there
had been several explosions that he assumed was ammunition. No one
was trying to put the fire out and it was spreading to surrounding
structures, he said, adding that it appeared headed for the
telephone company.
   Trinidadian James Fadelle of Miami said he had spoken with a
friend in Port-of-Spain by telephone earlier Friday evening.
   ``They're all locked up in their houses. They cannot go
outside,'' Fadelle said. He added that his friend, Peter Lambie,
had told him some civilians had been killed in the downtown area
and two police stations had been blown up.
   McComie said he was in the street by the radio station at 6 p.m.
when he heard gunshots inside Red House, which is the parliament
building. He said he returned safely to the station, but two gunmen
entered and set fire to the engineering department.
   McComie said radio employees were able to extinguish the fire.
   ``We can see people in the streets with guns,'' he said.
   The leader, Bakr, is a former police officer in Trinidad. Little
is known about him. Trinidad published reports say he spent some
time in Libya.
   Trinidad, the larger of the two islands in the nation of
Trinidad and Tobago, has a population of about 1.3 million, and is
just off the northeast coast of Venezuela. Trinidad and Tobago
gained independence from Britain in 1962. It is an English-speaking
country with a large populace from India.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindus. Only about 6 percent are Moslem.
   The island in recent years has suffered from a recession, with
closing of oil refineries, devaluation of the local currency and a
new, unpopular 15 percent value-added tax, according to locals.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain, creating controversy and
tensions on the island.
   The 1,500-member army has not entered into the fray yet, and is
said to be in northwestern Trinidad.
   The broadcast statement said the rebels were in touch with the
army but it was not known what that signified.
   The police force on Trinidad has about 5,000 members.
   McComie said he and his crew had locked themselves inside the
building and considered themselves ``in considerable danger.''
   Although station personnel felt in danger, they continued to
broadcast a live broadcast of a soccer game at the national stadium
in Port-of-Spain.
   A security guard at the Trinidad Guardian said the newspaper
building had been evacuated. He said that most likely there would
not be a Saturday edition.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Abu Bakr, the Moslem leader whose
rebels captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in a coup
attempt, has been fighting with the government for years.
   Most recently, Bakr has been involved in a dispute over medical
supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by Libya and
prohibited by customs agents from entering the country.
   One of the first things Bakr did after taking the leaders
captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute
free medicine to the poor people of Trinidad and Tobago.
   Members of his sect, Jamaat al-Muslimeen, have long been
perceived by many Trinidadians as violent outlaws, although they
proclaim moralistic motives for their actions.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, Arabic for
``Group of Moslems,'' six years ago.
   He has said he does not recognize ``man's laws,'' but only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   On Friday, he said he understood ``the present suffering of the
people'' and that Prime Minister Arthur Robinson had been
overthrown by God.
   ``God has removed him,'' Bakr said on government television.
``No man, including me, has power. ... He gave us victory over the
prime minister.''
   Bakr, his 200 to 250 followers and their wives and children live
on a commune in western Port-of-Spain.
   In 1988, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
   Bakr, a former policeman, said then his vigilantes were waging a
war against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   On Friday, he said, ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and
drugs which there was no hope for the present regime to stop.''
   Moslems make up 6 percent of the population of Trinidad and
Tobago, a former British colony just off the northeast coast of
Venezuela. Of the nation's 1.3 million people, about 40 percent are
of African descent and the same proportion is of East Indian
descent.
   Most of the East Indians are Hindu. Most of the Africans are
Roman Catholic or Protestant. The nation's small Moslem population
is mostly East Indians with some Africans. But the black Moslem
population has grown since the black power movement began 20 years
ago, and Bakr's sect is the largest among them.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Moslem zealot's attempt to
overthrow the government, and the burning and looting that
accompanied it, have staggered Trinidad after three decades of
stable democracy.
   The rebels surrendered Wednesday and the six-day coup attempt
ended with the safe release of the hostages, but the casualty toll
in the assault and subsequent violence was at least 38 dead and 150
wounded.
   Now Trinidadians face food and gasoline shortages, economic
disruption from a week of paralyzing curfews and the devastation
left by looters and arsonists.
   This racially and ethnically diverse nation known for sun and
calypso also must deal with tensions created by the violent effort
to destroy a democracy that has endured since independence from
Britain in 1962.
   ``As a sociologist, I know that conflict and crisis can either
splinter groups or unify them; it's never in-between,'' said
Anthony Maingot, who was born in Trinidad and is a Caribbean expert
at Florida International University in Miami.
   The coup attempt by Abu Bakr, leader of a commune of 250 to 350
Moslems, began July 27.
   Bakr and his followers, most of whom are poor and black,
attacked police headquarters with explosives and seized Prime
Minister N.R. Robinson and other government officials in Parliament
House.
   Other members of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen simultaneously invaded the
state television complex a mile away and took employees hostage.
   Bakr's immediate demands were the prime minister's resignation
and elections within 90 days.
   ``I don't know that they planned beyond taking Red House,'' the
parliament building, said Col. Joe Theodore, who led the Trinidad
and Tobago Defense Force in the crisis. ``He went in with a
half-baked plan.''
   The sports and culture minister, Jennifer Johnson, one of the
hostages, said the rebels were convinced they could improve
Trinidad by establishing a fundamentalist Moslem state. Bakr, whose
newspaper had attacked ``satanic'' U.S. and International Monetary
Fund economic treatment of Trinidad, promised to help the poor.
   There were no signs of popular support for Bakr's attempt to
overthrow th prime minister.
   Robinson trails in public opinion polls and elections are due
next year.
   Trinidad has had a boom-to-bust economy over the last 20 years
tied to the world price of oil, its main source of wealth.
   The 1970s oil boom brought prosperity and gave Trinidadians the
highest standard of living in the Caribbean. The bottom fell out of
the oil market in the 1980s and Trinidad's gross national product,
the value of all goods and services, has dropped 41 percent in
eight years.
   Robinson led the new National Alliance for Reconstruction to a
landslide in 1986 with promises of recovery, ousting the People's
National Movement, which had been in power since colonial days.
   He has tried to diversify the economy, partly by expanding
tourism, to which the island was largely indifferent during the oil
boom. Unpopular austerity measures demanded by the IMF in return
for loans included wage freezes, new taxes, public employee layoffs
and devaluations that cut the Trinidad dollar's value from about 42
cents to 24.
   Officials say the economy has shown signs of recovery, but that
Robinson's reserved personal style and an unraveling of his
coalition weakened the government.
   ``There is discontent in the country,'' government spokesman
Gregory Shaw said. ``Apparently, he (Abu Bakr) took this as a sign
that the people were ready to revolt, but that is not the way
Trinidadians change government.''
   Much of downtown Port-of-Spain was looted, prompting
international assistance that began with food shipments last week
from Venezuela.
   Tourism and foreign investment are expected to suffer.
   ``We will have to make an effort to win people's confidence,''
Shaw said.
   There were signs of strained ethnic relations during the
violence. Looters shouted epihets at Arab store owners and Moslems
were the targets of anger.
   Most of Trinidad's 1.3 million people are Hindu or Christian,
each representing more than 40 percent. Moslems make up about 6
percent and, among them, East Indians outnumber the blacks 20 to 1.
   Many East Indians scorn black Moslems as a sect outside the
mainstream Islamic community, an attitude resented by the Bakr and
his followers.
   Confidence in Robinson's government could be undermined by the
fact that such a small group was able to cripple the nation.
   Abu Bakr's sect had been involved in court cases and with
police. It was under surveillance and police spokesman Winston
Cooper said ``the Libyan connection was established.''
   Authorities say sect members received money and training from
Libya, although there is no evidence Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's
leader, was linked to the coup attempt.
   Raffique Shah, managing editor of The Mirror, said he hoped
other would-be rescuers of Trinidad would learn from Bakr's attempt
and ``see the futility of such action.''
   As the week ended, turmoil in another land offered some hope to
Trinidad. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed oil prices up.

   Nearly 400,000 Moslems make the
Caribbean their home, but most are East Indians who disdain the
radical politics of black Moslems like those who are holding
Trinidad's government hostage.
   Saturday, black Moslem Abu Bakr took over Parliament and
threatened to kill the prime minister and much of his Cabinet.
   Bakr is a fundamentalist who has developed strong support from
Trinidad's poor black community. His Jamaat al-Muslimeen sect has
an eight-acre commune in western Port-of-Spain, where more than 250
men, women and children live. There is a large mosque, day care
center, school and kitchens for the homeless.
   Bakr has close ties with Libya and has often stated that Islamic
principles must dominate society.
   But few East Indian Moslems support views like Bakr's and
tensions between Moslems of East Indian and African descent _ two
groups that rarely mix _ have been high.
   Many East Indians consider the black Moslems political
opportunists inspired more by the black power movement than by
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of
the 1960s in the United States, was born in Trinidad.
   Among the region's political leaders, prominent Moslems include
East Indian President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime Minister
Hamilton Green of Guyana, a black who converted to Islam in the
1960s.
   The first Moslems came to the region to work in the sugar cane
fields, either as black slaves in the 1700s or as indentured
servants from India 100 years later.
   Now domed mosques can be found on a dozen Caribbean islands, but
the heaviest concentrations of Moslems are on the islands of
Trinidad and Tobago and in Guyana and Suriname on the South
American mainland.
   ``One of the region's strongest religious trends today is the
movement toward Islam among blacks,'' says freelance writer Larry
Luxner, who lives in San Juan. In the last 20 years, many blacks
have converted to Islam.
   Luxner, who has written extensively on Moslems in the Caribbean,
estimates that Trinidad-Tobago and Suriname each have 100,000
Moslems and Guyana 120,000.
   Trinidad and Tobago is mostly a Hindu and Christian nation of
1.3 million people. About 6 percent of the population is Moslem,
with those of East Indian and African descent each make up 40
percent of the Moslem population.
   Writing in the Arabic magazine Aramco World in 1987, Luxner said
Trinidad had 85 mosques, Guyana 133 and Suriname, formerly Dutch
Guyana, 150. He said 25 percent of Suriname's 400,000 people were
Moslem, the highest percentage in any country in the Western
Hemisphere.
   There are also 2,500 Moslems in Puerto Rico, most of them
Palestinians who arrived between 1958 and 1962, Luxner said.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and the chief negotiator for his Moslem extremist captors
said Monday that they had reached agreement to end a 4-day-old
hostage siege.
   Robinson, other Cabinet ministers and lawmakers were among 41
hostages reported held by the black Moslems, who stormed the
Parliament building and the government television station on Friday
in a coup attempt. Robinson suffered gunshot wounds in both feet.
   Word of the accord came in telephone call to Trinidad journalist
Tony Fraser from inside Parliament and was not immediately
announced to the nation.
   Selwyn Richardson, the justice and national security minister,
said in the call that the agreement called for Robinson's immediate
resignation, with elections to be held within 90 days.
   Richardson said the government granted amnesty to rebel leader
Abu Bakr and his followers in the revolt, which has left at least
nine people dead and led to looting on this island-nation of 1.3
million residents.
   The official said, however, that the agreement was contingent
``upon the safe return of all members of Parliament'' now held
hostage.
   It was unclear when the hostage release might occur.
   The announcement came hours after government and military
spokesmen said negotiations with the radical Moslem group had
collapsed.
   Earlier Monday, security forces exchanged gunfire with the
rebels at both the parliament building and the state-run television
station, the two buildings were hostages were being held.
   Speaking from inside Parliament late Monday, Robinson said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. Joe Theodore, head of
the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator Bilal Abdullah, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister Robinson has just said.''
   The rebels claim Robinson's government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed on Saturday to have wired Robinson with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said Robinson was shot in both
feet and Richardson was shot in one leg when rebels stormed
Parliament.
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams reported that the Moslems were
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, Williams said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since Friday. He said Anglican
negotiator Knolly Clarke told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   The two sides nearly reached agreement earlier Monday but a
government official said negotiations stalled over conditions for
releasing the hostages, who include eight Cabinet ministers.
   Shaw said 41 hostages were being held and about 100 rebels were
involved in the siege.
   He said 16 hostages, including the government ministers, were
being held in the parliament building. The remaining 25 hostages
are all employees of the government TV station, he said.
   Among the dead were six rebels, two police officers and one
civilian, Williams said. Six rebels were known to be wounded.
Williams said three soldiers were wounded, none seriously.
   The State Department said Monday in Washington there are no
plans for U.S. military intervention in Trinidad. Deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher refused comment on reports of U.S. military
maneuvers in the area, but suggested a military solution was ruled
out.
   Boucher said none of the estimated 6,000 Americans living in
Trinidad and neighboring Tobago were reported hurt.
   He criticized Libya's involvement, saying the radical North
African Arab nation trained Trinidadian insurgents. But he said no
apparent direct link existed between Libya and the hostage-taking
in Trinidad.
   Shaw and Williams called a news conference hours after a gun
battle between security forces and rebels at the state-run Trinidad
and Tobago Television complex.
   Williams said rebels fired on troops in an apparent attempt to
escape the TV complex. ``We were fired upon; we fired back,'' he
said. ``We won the firefight. They withdrew.''
   Three buildings in the area were set ablaze, witnesses said.
   Sporadic gunfire also broke out at the parliament building,
about a mile away, where the ministers were held. The army said no
attempt was made to storm either building.
   Army chief Col. Ralph Brown said he did not think the hostages
suffered casualties.
   Jamaica said Monday it sent 120 soldiers to neighboring Barbados
to assist Trinidad if needed.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam in 1980, founded
Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic, in
1984. The group is believed to number 250 to 300.
   Shaw said a 6 p.m. to noon curfew would remain in effect
islandwide despite a ``significant diminishing'' in looting, which
caused an estimated $50 million damage to downtown stores.
   In a statement read on state radio, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Lucy Hall urged all American tourists in Trinidad to obey the
curfew.
   Caribbean leaders gathering in Kingston, Jamaica, for a
conference added regional security to their agenda because of
Trinidad and Tobago. Heads of state and other government leaders
from the 13 member nations will open the Caribbean Economic
Community conference on Tuesday.
   Robinson easily won the 1986 parliamentary elections. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until 1991.

   Caribbean leaders Saturday condemned
the attempted overthrow of the government of Trinidad and Tobago.
Jamaica and Barbados put their armies on alert in case Trinidad's
government asks for help.
   Several Caribbean heads of state and government officials were
in Jamaica to attend a summit of the Caribbean Economic Community.
The meeting starts Sunday.
   Trinidad Prime Minister Arthur N. Robinson, who has been held
hostage since Friday by black Moslem rebels in Port-of-Spain,
Trinidad's capital, is an influential figure within the community
and had planned to attend the summit.
   Trinidad and Tobago, with a population of 1.3 million, is the
second largest member after Jamaica in the 13-nation Caribbean
community, which groups 11 island nations as well as Guyana and
Belize.
   Percival J. Patterson, acting prime minister of Jamaica, said
his country's defense force was being readied in the event the
community was asked to provide military assistance.
   ``The army has been placed on full alert,'' Patterson said after
a meeting in Kingston with other Caribbean leaders who had arrived
early for the summit.
   Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of Barbados said his island
nation's army had also been placed on alert.
   ``Barbados supports democratic government, and where such
governments are overthrown or threatened by illegal means, we will
not support this,'' Sandiford said. ``If any request is made we
will consider assistance.''
   In Dominica, Prime Minister Eugenia Charles called for an end to
the takeover attempt.
   ``We cannot allow this nonsense,'' said Ms. Charles, who asked
for U.S. military intervention in Grenada in 1983 after a bloody
coup there.
   Troops from the Caribbean community provided token support for
the invading U.S. forces, which ousted the Marxist military junta
that took power after killing Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
several government ministers.
   Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, also pledged
Saturday ``to render whatever assistance'' possible if Trinidad's
government asks for help from the Caribbean organization.
   Pindling did not indicate, however, whether his administration
was willing to consider military assistance.
   Trinidad's foreign minister, Sahadeo Basdeo, who had led a
delegation to pre-summit discussions in Kingston, said Saturday
afternoon that he would attempt to return home to assess the
situation.
   ``We are pleading with the rebels to free the prime minister and
to talk about their problems,'' Basdeo said. ``We are pleading for
common sense and rationality to prevail, and for a restoration of
democracy.''
   In Port-of-Spain, Acting Foreign Minister Edden Shand, who was
released by the rebels Saturday, made a statement on radio opposing
any foreign military intervention.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   In Caracas, the Venezuelan government said it would not
recognize any rebel government in Trinidad and Tobago, a former
British colony of two islands which lies off Venezuela's coast.
   ``Venezuela ... energetically rejects this attempt to overthrow
the constitutional government,'' said the statement released
Saturday by the government news agency Venpres.
   Trinidad and Tobago is one of 48 members of the Commonwealth, an
association of Britain and its former colonies. In London, the
Commonwealth secretary general on Saturday called the attempted
coup ``unwelcome and unacceptable.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, another Commonwealth
member, called for the immediate release of Robinson and other
government hostages.

   The State Department said Monday there are no
plans for U.S. military intervention to bring an end to the
Moslem-led insurrection against the elected government in Trinidad.
   While refusing comment on reports of U.S. military maneuvers in
the area, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher suggested that a
military solution had been ruled out.
   At the same time, Boucher criticized Libya's involvement with
the rebels, saying it has provided some training for the
insurgents. But he said there was no apparent direct link between
Libya and hostage-taking which occurred last Friday.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and capturing
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Robinson and one other goverment minister were believed to have
been shot in the leg early in the coup attempt, and both have been
getting medical attention, said Bernard W. Aronson, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Trinidad government spokesman Gregory Shaw identified the second
victim as Justice Minister Selwyn Richardson, and said both men
were in stable condition. Shaw said Robinson had been shot in both
feet, not the legs
   Aronson, who spoke in an interview on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' on the Public Broadcasting System, also said people were
killed in the coup attempt but said the department did not have a
figure on the casualties. He said none of them was a high-ranking
government official, but he declined to identify the victims
further.
   The Trinidad crisis has some of the earmarks of the situation in
Grenada seven years ago when a radical leftist movement took power.
In that case, the United States and several other Caribbean
countries decided to oust the radicals.
   As in Grenada, the insurgents have shown a willingness to use
extremist methods to advance their cause.
   In both Grenada and Trinidad, there were signs of involvement by
anti-American elements from abroad. In Grenada, the leadership
there had close links to Cuba while in Trinidad, Libya has been
allied with the rebels. Also, in both cases, a major concern of
Washington has been the well being of thousands of Americans
residing in the two countries.
   But a major difference between the two situations is that
whereas virtually all of the Americans in Grenada were students at
a medical school, the 6,000 Americans in Trinidad are dispersed
around the island and are less vulnerable to a mass hostage-taking.
   The international political climate also has undergone a
dramatic transformation since 1983, a period when Cold War tensions
were at a peak.
   There is little indication that the events in Trinidad will have
an impact beyond that country's borders. This was not the case in
1983, when members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
asked for the dispatch of U.S. troops.
   Beyond that, American officials said government officials in
Trinidad have indicated a desire to resolve the crisis without
outside help.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Coup leader Abu Bakr and 112
militant Moslem followers surrendered Wednesday and freed 46
hostages they seized five days earlier in a failed bid to overthrow
the government, officials said.
   State radio said a wounded hostage freed on Saturday died on
Wednesday in a hospital. That raised the death toll in the uprising
to at least 10.
   Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran said the rebels, who
appeared not to have any significant support among the people,
``surrendered unconditionally'' and were under heavy guard at an
army base.
   He said they would face ``the appropriate charges,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Dookeran told reporters that Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson
had not resigned, as he had offered to while held hostage.
   ``Prime Minister Robinson is the prime minister of Trinidad and
Tobago,'' Dookeran said. ``There is no intention to resign.''
   ``We have made no deals with this extremist group,'' said
Dookeran, who was held hostage on the first day of the coup attempt.
   Bakr released Dookeran on Saturday, saying he wanted the deputy
prime minister to head a caretaker government that would hold new
elections in the Caribbean nation.
   The attempted coup began Friday when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and other captives.
   Bakr had demanded the resignation of Robinson, whom he accused
of corruption.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed Tuesday and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover
as well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   Bakr blamed Robinson for widespread poverty in this former
British colony of 1.3 million people. Bakr was among the rebels who
surrendered at the television station, where the first group of
hostages was freed.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said 113 rebels, including
Bakr, took part in the coup. He said 46 hostages held at Parliament
and the TV building one mile away were released Wednesday.
   Shaw and army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams said all hostages and
rebels had been evacuated and taken to separate army bases.
   State radio identified the former hostage who died Wednesdey as
Leo des Vignes, a junior minister. It said he died of a heart
attack in the hospital after being shot in the heel during the
takeover.
   The rebels released him on Saturday, the broadcast said.
   The radio said heavy gunfire was reported Wednesday evening in
Champs Fleurs, about 10 miles east of Port-of-Spain. There was no
official explanation, but soldiers have been firing blank bullets
to scatter would-be looters for several days.
   The 29 captives at the TV station were all station employees.
The remaining 17 hostages at the Parliament building included seven
Cabinet ministers.
   In a live broadcast, state radio described the haggard-looking
captives filing out of the television station, one by one.
   Soldiers searched each one in the street, because the militants
had claimed at one point to have wired the captives with explosives
and threatened to blow them up.
   After the prisoner release, witnesses said about 50 rebels left
the television building, dropped their weapons and surrendered to
soldiers.
   Witnesses said Bakr emerged wearing a fez, a white tunic and
white trousers. Like the other rebels, he dropped his gun and put
his hands behind his head.
   After boarding an army bus, Bakr shouted: ``Allahu akhbar!'' or
God is great.
   Hostages began leaving the Parliament building at 5:10 p.m. EDT.
The first to leave was a woman who held a white handkerchief to her
face.
   An army truck rolled up to the red, colonial-style building to
provide cover for soldiers who escorted her down the street.
   A few minutes later, the finance minister, Selby Wilson,
emerged, followed by another man who had a white handkerchief tied
across his face. The two men walked unescorted to a security van.
   The hostages walked along a sidewalk to a security area at the
end of the street, where they emptied their pockets and were
searched before getting onto an army bus. Some of the hostages
jogged down the street; others walked.
   Justice Minister Selwyn Richardson, reportedly shot in the leg
during the Parliament takeover, walked with a noticeable limp.
Applause broke out as he boarded the bus.
   State radio said the rebels were taken to army headquarters at
Chaguerames in northwest Trinidad and the freed hostages to Camp
Ogden, an army base about five miles west of Port-of-Spain.
   A local reporter who spoke with the former hostages at Camp
Ogden said they told him they had not eaten since Friday but were
otherwise OK. They were all undergoing medical exams in a tent.
   At Ogden Camp, freed hostage Grensell Kissoon, told a reporter,
``I'm glad to be alive.''
   TV station worker Raul Board held onto a post, saying he feared
he might faint from hunger. ``You know why I'm holding the post?
I'm afraid I might fall.''
   The capital was quiet Wednesday. A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew
remained in effect throughout most of Trinidad following earlier
widespread looting.
   Bakr's Jamaat al-Muslimeen group, which means the Moslem Group
in Arabic, was founded in 1984 and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from Libya.
   Gargano had said 200 troops from neighboring Caribbean nations
were on neighboring Barbados and ``could be here in 45 minutes,''
but that Trinidad and its sister island of Tobago had not asked for
help.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A group of black Moslems who
kidnapped the prime minister and some Cabinet members in a coup
attempt said today the captives may be harmed if the government
moves against a rebel-held TV station.
   One report said three people were killed in the first hours of
the rebel strike, which began Friday on the former British colony
of two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' the coup leader, Abu
Bakr, said on government TV Friday evening after the station was
seized by his followers.
   But government radio said today that a state of emergency had
been declared and that police were moving into the streets of the
capital of this southern Caribbean nation to restore order.
   Gunfire was heard in the direction of the television station,
located in northeastern Port-of-Spain about two miles from the
Parliament building and the main police station. Buildings also
were burning in eastern Port-of-Spain.
   Education Minister Clive Pantin said on government radio that he
had not been captured by the rebels and that the mutineers had
already released two unidentified ministers and four civilians they
had been holding.
   The Barbados-based Caribbean News Agency, or CANA, said three
people had been killed as the coup attempt began with an explosion
at the police station and rebels bursting into Parliament firing
weapons.
   It said a news reporter had seen the body of a woman Parliament
worker in the Parliament building, and it quoted witnesses as
saying they saw two bodies in front of the building.
   In Washington, a State Department official said it appeared
``the active elements of the insurrection are limited to the
television station and the parliament building.''
   ``We understand there has been some looting'' in the streets,
``but nothing affecting the safety of our embassy or foreign
nationals,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Trinidad's island of Tobago is a popular vacation site
for Americans and others.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen. She said the U.S.
government had not yet received a request for international aid,
but would consider it once it arrives.
   Bakr, a former policeman who heads a group called Jamaat
al-Muslimeen, Arabic for the Moslem Group, has said he doesn't
recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding. News reports say Abu Bakr has visited
Libya.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The mostly Hindu
and Roman Catholic country of 1.3 million people has a 1,500-member
army and a 5,000-member police force.
   The State Department said earlier that the United States would
``deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
Trinidad.''
   Prime Minister Arthur Robinson's National Alliance for
Reconstruction won parliamentary elections in December 1986. The
next elections are due in 1991.
   British West Indies Airways and American Airlines canceled
commercial flights into Trinidad on Friday evening. Piarco
International Airport remained under control of government security
forces but was closed early today.
   When Bakr broadcast his claim of a takeover, he did not disclose
the whereabouts of Robinson and the other captured officials. It
was not known how many Cabinet ministers were taken hostage with
Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and economist.
   But the news director at the captured government television
station went on the air this morning and said the prime minister
and the other officials were alive and being ``well treated.''
   The news director, Jones Madeira, said some of the officials
were being held at the TV station and others at the Parliament
building, Red House.
   But he warned that the television station's signals were being
tampered with and ``this could endanger the lives of those people
being held.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin told government radio
he had spoken to Madeira by telephone.
   ``He asked me to emphasize the request not to interfere with the
television channels, because if they do something may happen,'' the
prelate said.
   Several government ministers were seen on the rebel-controlled
television. Government radio, the National Broadcasting Service's
Radio 610, said the capital's police station was blown up and
burned out of control for hours.
   It said no one attempted to put out the fire, and there were
several explosions of what was assumed to be ammunition in the
station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at 6 p.m. Friday to announce
the uprising. He said his followers planned no violence, looting or
retribution against civilians, and promised ``free and fair''
elections within 90 days.
   Government radio said before dawn today that there had been some
looting and police had moved into the streets.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, has been arrested several times in the
past on charges of contempt of court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of Port-of-Spain. Members of the
sect, founded in 1980, are widely perceived in Trinidad as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   In 1988, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
Bakr said then his vigilantes were waging a war against ``the
menace of cocaine.''
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said in Friday's
broadcast.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by Libya.

   Here are some facts and figures on Trinidad and Tobago:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ The island of Trinidad is in the Caribbean about
eight miles off northeast Venezuela. The smaller island of Tobago
lies about 20 miles farther to the northeast. Together, they cover
1,978 square miles, about 1{ times the size of Rhode Island. The
capital is Port-of-Spain. The terrain consists of plains and low
mountains. The climate is tropical.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The nation has a cosmopolitan population of about
1.3 million, all but 45,000 residing on Trinidad. Most of the
people are of African or East Indian origin. Trinidadians of mixed
race make up slightly more than 16 percent. Whites comprise 1.7
percent. The two major folk traditions are Creole, a mixture of
African elements influenced by Spanish, French and English culture,
and East Indian. About 33 percent are Roman Catholics, 24.5 percent
Hindus, 15 percent Anglicans and about 6 percent Moslems. The
language is English.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Trinidad and Tobago's exports consist mainly of
petroleum and petroleum products, fertilizers, chemicals, sugar and
cocoa. It has a small tourism industry, with a famous reef for
divers off Tobago and a carnival in Port-of-Spain. The territory is
largely dependent on imported food.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Columbus discovered Trinidad on his third voyage to
the New World in 1498. Spain made the first successful attempt to
colonize the island in 1592 and Spanish rule continued until
Trinidad was captured by the British in 1797. Abolition of slavery
throughout the British Empire in 1833 led to a wave of immigration
from India that went on until 1915. Trinidad and Tobago were merged
in 1888. After a brief spell of being part of an autonomous
Federation of the West Indies with Jamaica, Barbados, and the
Leeward and Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago became
independent and joined the Commonwealth in 1962.
   The nation has a bicameral legislature of Senate and House of
Representatives. The Cabinet consists of the prime minister,
appointed by the president, and other ministers.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson said he was gagged, beaten and shot in the leg by Moslem
fundamentalists who held him and other Cabinet ministers hostage in
an attempt to overthrow the government.
   ``I was incensed at the manner in which we were treated,''
Robinson said in a television interview broadcast Friday night. It
was his first public appearance since he was freed Tuesday.
   ``We were roughed up, made to lie face down on the floor, our
pants down, legs tied ... unable to turn except with excrutiating
pain,'' he said.
   Robinson, whose right cheek was badly bruised, spoke from his
hospital bed to Trinidad television.
   Robinson spoke briefly of his five-day captivity inside the
Parliament chamber and of the Moslem insurgents who held Cabinet
members inside the building until they surrendered on Wednesday.
   ``I really do not wish to re-live those events at this
particular moment,'' he said. ``But it is a fact I was gagged; that
the gag was being pushed down my throat by a gun.''
   Robinson said the gag thrust down his throat caused him to
vomit. He said he was shot in the right leg after shouting
``Murderers! Torturers!'' and calling on his two-way radio to the
armed forces to storm the building.
   Robinson said his leg ``is still in such a state that I cannot
use it.''
   The prime minister, who is losing his eyesight because of
glaucoma, was released by the rebels Tuesday for health reasons.
   ``Now, I could have been out before on medical grounds, but I
was convinced that my duty was to stay with my colleagues until the
fate of all of us was certain,'' he said.
   Robinson did not say whether he signed an agreement with the
rebels, who had insisted on his resignation and early elections as
conditions for the release of the hostages.
   Besides Robinson and his Cabinet, the rebels also held 26 other
hostages inside the Trinidad and Tobago Television station.
   Officials said an estimated 38 people were killed during the
coup attempt. Maj. Dave Williams said the government is still
trying to determine the count.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of the Moslem radicals, and more than 100
of his followers were being held at the Chaguaramas military
headquarters. Lawyers were meeting Saturday to draw up charges
against them that could include murder, treason and kidnapping.
   On Saturday, one of Bakr's followers was killed in a shootout
with police.
   Police Inspector Winston Cooper said Njassane Omuaali, 21, was
killed during an exchange of gunfire and was among a ``band of
Moslems'' who fired on police.
   But Omuaali's grandmother, Elaine Bailey, said her grandson, the
son of Bakr's first wife, was killed after police seized him.
   ``They grabbed him, kicked him down the stairs and killed him.
They shot him,'' said Ms. Bailey, 75, in a telephone interview.
   She said Omuaali was scheduled to return Saturday to Washington,
where he was studying finance and accounting at Howard University
on a U.N. fellowship.
   In another development, Guyana sent 40 troops to Trinidad to
assist authorities. More than 100 other troops from Jamaica and
Barbados were assisting Trinidadian troops.
   A state of emergency remained in effect with a curfew in
Port-of-Spain from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Soldiers and police were still
combing the city for any explosives that could have been left
behind in the coup attempt.

<HEAD>Prime Minister of Trinidad Blames U.S. on Arms Purchase Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago
said Thursday that U.S. authorities failed to tell his government
of arms purchases in Miami by Moslem coup-plotters.
   ``If we had the information possessed by U.S. authorities in
Miami, this coup would have been avoided,'' Prime Minister Arthur
N.R. Robinson told a news conference.
   Later, a U.S. State Department official, requesting anonymity,
said, ``We did not withhold information which would have enabled
Prime Minister Robinson to prevent the coup d'etat.''
   On July 27, Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the
government-run TV station and took the prime minister and more than
50 others hostage.
   The ensuing six-day siege and accompanying looting left 24
people dead and 500 wounded. Trinidad is a Caribbean island nation
of 1.2 million people off northeast Venezuela. The fighting caused
an estimated $60 million damage to the main shopping district in
Port-of-Spain.
   In answer to a question, Robinson said his government has
evidence the rebels had ties to Libya.
   ``In fact, the leader of the terrorist organization has
confessed openly about his visits and relations with Libya.''
   He declined to say, however, whether the coup was backed by
Libya, saying the case was in the courts.
   Rebel leader Yasin Abu Bakr, a former policeman who converted to
Islam, and 113 followers were jailed to face charges of treason and
murder after the coup was suppressed. Saying it fearing that Bakr's
supporters might be plotting another attack, the government
extended a state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation
gives security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   Robinson, who was shot in the leg by the rebels, said in a
speech to the United Nations General Assembly that the coup was
launched by ``a new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration,
but acting rather under satanic impulse.''
   Robinson walked with a cane as he went to the podium at U.N.
headquarters.
   After his speech, Robinson told reporters that he would raise
the issue of exchanging information about security when he meets
President Bush on Monday in Washington.
   ``We must find out why there was not a proper transfer of
information,'' he said. ``We want to ensure that in the future,
more effective arrangements are made about information exchange.''
   He said it was common knowledge that some of those later
involved in the coup were buying weapons in Miami with large
amounts of U.S. currency and shipping the arms to the island
nation, a former British colony.
   U.S. authorities in Miami knew about the arms purchases, he
said.
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said, ``there was much more information that
U.S. authorities had'' which was not passed along to his
government.
   Federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
arrested an Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach, Fla., on charges
of supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other equipment to the
coup leaders.
   But Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the bureau in Washington,
said its agents were not aware of any contact between the man
buying the guns and Trinidad until after the coup attempt.
   ``Had it been known that the firearms were going to go to
Trinidad, the Trinidad authorities would have been notified,''
Killorin said. ``It simply was not known until Trinidad authorities
captured the arms and we matched them to the arms shipment in
Miami.''
   ``We couldn't agree more with the prime minister that
governments should set up avenues of communication to crack down on
this gun running,'' he added.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Black Moslem rebel Abu Bakr, long
at odds with authorities, says their decision to spend $500,000 on
a memorial to a dead woman leader was the ``straw that broke the
camel's back.''
   Shortly after his followers seized Parliament house Friday, Bakr
commandeered the government television station and announced he had
overthrown Prime Minister Arthur Robinson and was holding him
hostage with his Cabinet.
   Speaking to the country on television, he accused Robinson's
4-year-old government of mismanagement and corruption. He singled
out Robinson's announcement on June 23 that a monument would be
built in honor of Jean Miles, a senior public servant who died more
than a decade ago.
   ``That was the straw that broke the camel's back: the allocation
of $500,000 to create a concrete statue to this woman, while poor
people all over the country are starving,'' he said.
   Bakr, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-2-inch, charismatic leader, has
long considered himself a spokesman for the poor.
   A former mounted policeman who converted to Islam while studying
in Canada in the early 1980s, Bakr founded and has been the leader
for six years of the Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune. It is on eight
acres of former swamp land on the western edge of Port-of-Spain,
the capital.
   The rebel leader, in his late-40s, is married and has a son and
daughter believed to be attending the University of Toronto. His
wife, Annisa, is an executive for the Trinidad and Tobago
Industrial Development Corp.
   Another major source of friction with authorities is the city
council's contention that Bakr built his commune without a clear
title to the land.
   In the early 1970s, the late Prime Minister Eric Williams
donated the land to East Indian Moslems to build whatever they
wanted. But they never picked up the offer.
   Abu Bakr returned from Canada in 1984 and grabbed the land,
saying his black Moslems had a right to it.
   He built a mosque in the center and living quarters for his 250
to 300 followers. Four major buildings include a kitchen for the
poor and a large school.
   The dispute came to a head in the 1980s when Bakr was jailed for
several weeks for contempt of court when he failed to answer
charges of illegal occupation brought by the council.
   Over the years, the commune has been raided by police looking
for arms and ammunition. They found a few rifles and small amounts
of ammunition.
   Three months ago, police and defense force soldiers seized a
portion of the commune where Bakr was constructing a new building.
Bakr sought a court order to remove the troops.
   A week ago, High Court Judge Ivol Blackman ruled against Bakr.
   Another irritant was the government's recent refusal to
distribute free medical supplies and pharmaceuticals Bakr wanted to
donate to people of the island.
   He said he had received the supplies from a U.N. agency.
However, it was widely believed in Trinidad that they came from
Libya.
   Bakr is thought to receive financial support from Libya and has
visited that North African country several times.
   He has also been highly critical of the government's record on
fighting drugs and even formed a paramilitary squad to raid drug
dealers. This earned him the enmity of the police.
   Moslems in mostly Hindu and Christian Trinidad make up 6 percent
of the population of 1.3 million people.
   There are only a small number of black Moslems outside Bakr's
group. Most are East Indians, who consider the blacks as
opportunists guided by politics more than the Koran.
   A Moslem leader in Canada who knew Bakr when he converted to
Islam, said he was ``committed to social justice.''
   Hardon Salamat, head of the Toronto and Region Islamic
Congregation, said in an interview that he thinks Bakr's action
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.''
   Salamat said Bakr's group receives financing from Moslems around
the world, including those in Toronto and Montreal.

<HEAD>Moslem Militants Appear in Court Amid Tight Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - A magistrate ordered a delay
Thursday in the start of a hearing for Yasin Abu Bakr and 112 other
Moslem militants who captured the prime minister during a coup
attempt.
   Chief Magistrate Melville Baird granted a prosecution request
for an adjournment to allow more time to prepare its case. The
magistrate set Sept. 25 as the new date for the preliminary
hearing.
   Bakr, 48, a former policeman, and the members of his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) face the death penalty for
charges that include murder and treason.
   About two dozen female Jamaat supporters shouted ``Allah
akbar!'' (God is great) as Bakr and 18 other prisoners filed into
the courtroom, where they were kept in a specially built iron cage
for the 45-minute proceedings.
   For security reasons, the remaining prisoners are to appear
later in four separate groups.
   Heavily armed soldiers in camouflage uniforms ringed the
converted gym in the western town of Chaguaramas, 10 miles outside
Port-of-Spain, for the Moslems' first court appearance since the
six-day coup attempt ended Aug. 1.
   Wearing a white tunic and black fez, the Moslem leader bowed to
reporters and said: ``Morning to the press. Morning everybody.''
   Spectators were searched and scanned with metal detectors before
entering the courtroom. An armored tank was positioned outside.
   Prosecutor Theodore Guerra said the newly appointed head of the
prosecution team, Karl Hudson-Phillips, needed more time to prepare
his case. Defense attorney Nathaniel King had no objection.
   Bakr and his followers captured the Parliament and state-run
television station and seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson
and more than 50 others, including several Cabinet members.
   The attack and subsequent looting left 24 dead. Robinson, 63,
was shot in the left leg. Bakr and his men are charged in
connection with eight deaths.
   Bakr had blamed Robinson's administration for widespread poverty
in this once oil-wealthy Caribbean nation off Venezuela.
   Trinidad and its sister island of Tobago remain under a state of
emergency, giving police wide powers of search and arrest, and a
nighttime curfew.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson was freed by his Moslem captors today but other officials
held hostage were not released, the government announced.
   Attorney General Anthony Smart gave no details of how and under
what conditions the prime minister, who had been shot in both feet
during the uprising, was freed. But the release of Robinson alone
indicated the 5-day-old standoff between the government and Moslem
extremists was not over.
   ``We continue to pray for the safe return of the rest of the
hostages,'' Smart told state radio.
   He said Robinson was the only one of the 41 hostages released.
   Smart said Robinson, who was freed at 1:20 p.m. EDT, ``is in
good spirits.''
   The siege began Friday when radical Moslems led by Abu Bakr
stormed Parliament and the government-run television station in
Trinidad's capital city. Bakr has accused the government of
mismanagement.
   The release came after a day of conflicting reports over the
progress of negotiations to end the hostage siege, which has
plunged this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million residents off
northeast Venezuela into chaos.
   On Monday night, Robinson had said by telephone that he had
accepted an agreement under which he would resign and Bakr and his
men would be granted amnesty.
   But government officials said today that no such agreement
existed and that Robinson had made the statement under duress.
   Bakr said earlier today that the rebels agreed that Winston
Dookeran, the deputy prime minister, would replace Robinson when he
steps down. Dookeran was released from the Parliament building
Friday.
   The interim government would be a coalition consisting of
representatives of all major political parties, along with Bakr's
Jamaat al-Muslimeen group.
   The group, which is believed to number 250 to 300, has blamed
Robinson for widespread poverty in this once-oil rich Caribbean
nation near Venezuela. It has little support among the populace.
   Bakr is a former policeman who converted to Islam in 1980 and
has long considered himself a champion of the downtrodden. He
founde Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic,
in 1984.
   Robinson easily won parliamentary elections in 1986. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until 1991.
   On Monday, security forces exchanged gunfire with the rebels at
Parliament and at the government television station. Three
buildings in and around the TV complex were set ablaze but no
injuries were reported.
   At least nine people _ six rebels, two police officers and a
civilian _ have been killed since the siege began, and the
instability has spawned massive looting in Trinidad and Tobago, a
two-island nation of 1.3 million people. State radio said some
looters were shot Monday but gave no details.
   Bakr has ties to Libya and it is believed he has received
funding from that country. In a conversation with local radio
today, he said he had no regrets over what he had done.
   ``I hope we can settle it in love,'' he said.
   Asked if the siege could end in violence, he said, ``Everyone
will die at some time in their lives.''

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Gunfire and explosions broke out
today around the government television station and Parliament,
where Moslem extremists held the prime minister and 30 other people
hostage for a fourth day.
   Later today, an Anglican minister negotiating between the
government and the rebels said a settlement was likely.
   The heaviest shooting was centered on the television station,
whose employees were taken hostage Friday. Automatic rifle and
machine-gun fire was punctuated by what sounded like artillery
booms.
   One witness said he heard four explosions that sounded like
bombs.
   ``A major firefight is going on,'' said a diplomatic source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The shooting at the station appeared to be coming from two
directions, but it was not clear whether security forces had tried
to storm the building.
   Earlier, automatic weapons fire rang out near Parliament, about
a mile from the television station, where rebels seized Prime
Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Friday. Witnesses said they heard
what sounded like heavy artillery booms.
   A ham radio operator in Trinidad said he monitored a radio
communication indicating security forces had stormed the television
station and were moving on Parliament.
   But Col. Ralph Brown of the Trinidad-Tobago Defense Force denied
the station was attacked.
   He told reporters that troops had fired on the TV station when
the rebels tried to leave the building. ``Some of his men tried to
come out and we are not letting them out.''
   An Anglican minister who was negotiating between the rebels and
the government, the Rev. Knolly Clarke, also spoke with reporters
early this afternoon.
   When asked if a peaceful solution was likely, he said, ``Yes,
today. The end is in sight.''
   One of the rebels inside Parliament, Kwasi Attiba, said by
telephone that a tentative agreement with the government had been
reached to end the siege.
   Attiba said the accord called for Robinson to resign immediately
and be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran. Attiba
gave no indication when Robinson and other other hostages would be
released, and no government official could be reached to confirm
his report.
   An agreement was also reported Sunday by a television executive,
Jones Madeira, who was held at the station. He said in a telephone
interview that under the plan, Robinson would turn over power to an
interim government, which would rule until elections in three
months.
   Robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide,
and the next elections are not scheduled until 1991.
   The rebels claim Robinson's government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed Saturday to have wired Robinson with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Attiba said the gunfire at Parliament came from police ``who
have been attempting to thwart'' negotiations.
   Attiba said the rebels were holding eight government ministers
along with the prime minister.
   Energy Minister Herbert Atwell said Sunday the two sides were
far from a settlement. But Attiba said: ``We are very hopeful for
an amicable solution.''
   Security forces patrolled the capital with orders to shoot
looters on sight.
   Abu Bakr, leader of a black Moslem commune, stormed Parliament
on Friday and captured Robinson and most of his Cabinet. Bakr is
believed backed by Libya but has little general support.
   Simultaneously, the rebels seized the government television
station and its employees.
   Unconfirmed reports said more than 20 people had been killed in
the fighting. A medical officer at the state hospital said today he
could confirm only five deaths, including that of a police officer.
   Fires burned in the capital of Port-of-Spain on Sunday. There
was scattered gunfire and widespread looting. Convoys of cars and
pickup trucks were loading up with everything from looted powdered
milk to refrigerators, electric stoves and television sets.
   The government sent police and military patrols to re-establish
order and continued a nationwide curfew that was imposed Saturday.
   Atwell, representing the government, appeared on national
television late Sunday with an official statement saying: ``I am in
no position to offer any hope that the situation will be resolved
speedily and-or amicably.''
   He confirmed reports that Robinson and Justice Minister Selwyn
Richardson had each been shot in the leg.
   State-run radio 610 said Nolli Clarke, an Anglican priest, was
the official mediator with help from Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah
and Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Patin.
   The Red Cross sent mobile units to take blood donations from
people too frightened to leave their homes.
   Radio 610 estimated damage downtown at $50 million as thousands
of people looted stores, shopping centers, warehouses and
industrial plants.
   A spokeswoman for President Bush said Sunday that American
citizens and tourists on Trinidad and Tobago did not appear to be
in danger.
   ``Obviously we support the government and are coordinating
closely with them until the situation is resolved,'' a State
Department official said in Washington. The official did not want
to be identified.
   Bakr is a former policeman in his mid-40s who converted to Islam
in 1980 while living in Canada.
   He founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in
Arabic, in 1984 and set up a commune on land he said had been
donated to Moslems by the late prime minister, Eric Williams.
   Bakr built a mosque, a school and a kitchen to feed the
homeless. Some 250 to 300 Moslems live there.
   Bakr has visited Libya several times and is believed to have
received assistance from that country.
   He has said the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and the
destruction'' of Trinidad and Tobago, which has high unemployment
and skyrocketing food prices.

   The White House expressed ``strong
support'' Saturday for Trinidad's prime minister, a captive of
black Moslem rebels who took over the Caribbean island's parliament.
   President Bush was spending the weekend relaxing at his
oceanfront summer home here, but he and national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft were kept abreast of the attempted coup, a
spokeswoman said.
   Bush, who spent the morning on the tennis courts and boating,
attended the wedding of a second cousin in late afternoon.
   Deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said Bush and Scowcroft were
``following the situation carefully'' in Trinidad and Tobago, a
former British colony off the coast of Venezuela that gained
independence in 1962.
   ``We maintain our strong support for the Democratic government
of Prime Minister (Arthur) Robinson,'' Ms. Glen said.
   ``It appears that no American citizens are in any danger. The
situation seems limited to one building,'' she said.
   Trinidad and Tobago have not yet asked for help, but the United
States would consider the request if they do, she said.
   Robinson and several members of his cabinet were being held
hostage in the parliament in Port-of-Spain by rebels led by former
policeman Abu Bakr, leader of a Moslem sect that said it recognizes
no government but ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   Later, the State Department issued this written statement:
   ``We condemn yesterday's attempt by a violent extremist group to
overthrow the democratic government of Trinidad and Tobago. We call
upon the parties in this attempted coup to release the hostages
under their control and to surrender to the legislative
constitutional authority of Trinidad and Tobago. This violent
attack on the government has no support from the people of Trinidad
and Tobago who have enjoyed a long tradition of democratic
government. The United States fully supports the elected government
and is consulting closely with it and other interested governments
in the region.''
   An administration official who accompanied Bush to Maine said
the army was still loyal to the prime minister and his
four-year-old government.
   On another international hotspot, Liberia, Ms. Glen said, ``The
situation has not changed. We're following it closely.''
   The beleaguered government of President Samuel Doe has been
under siege for weeks in that West African nation. Rebel leader
Charles Taylor claimed Friday to have established his own
government, even though street fighting continued.
   Bush, getting a weekend respite from the drawn out negotiations
with Democrats over the budget deficit, brought his wife, Barbara,
daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and several grandchildren with him
Friday on the flight from Washington to Pease Air Force Base in
Newington, N.H.
   He also gave his taciturn Supreme Court nominee, David H.
Souter, a ride home to New Hampshire. Before heading off to visit
his mother at a Concord nursing home, Souter said it felt ``damn
good'' to be back in the Granite State.
   This was the Bushes' third visit to their vacation home since
Memorial Day.
   President and Mrs. Bush attended the wedding of a second cousin,
Ruben Andrus Holden V, 37, of Marshfield, Mass., to Pamela Anne
Grindle, 35, of Boston, at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in
Kennebunkport.
   The stone church, which overlooks the Atlantic, is where the
Bushes attend Sunday services. Guests were required to walk through
a portable metal detector.
   Mrs. Bush will stay behind when the president heads back to the
White House on Sunday evening. The president will return here to
Walker's Point on Aug. 10 and stay until Labor Day.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - ``Sorry for inconvenience caused
by the criminal acts of frenzied looters,'' reads the sign in the
window of the closed Hometown Pharmacy. ``We'll be back as soon as
possible.''
   The suburban drug store was among scores of businesses plundered
after Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the government-run TV
station on July 27 and took the prime minister and more than 50
others hostage.
   Nearly two months later, Trinidadians are still feeling
aftershocks of the six-day siege and accompanying looting that left
24 people dead and 500 wounded on this tiny nation of 1.2 million
inhabitants off the coast of Venezuela.
   The fighting delvered a shock to the ailing Trinidadian
economy, causing an estimated $60 million damage to the devastated
main shopping district of Port-of-Spain. Tourism, not surprisingly,
was also hurt.
   But there is a touch of irony in the fact that only hours after
rebel Yasin Abu Bakr and his followers surrendered Aug. 1, Iraq
invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices skyrocketing. Trinidad produces
just under 1 percent of the world's oil.
   The worst long-term damage may be to the nation's sense of
itself as a land of British-style democracy, multiracial harmony,
oil wealth, cricket and calypso.
   For Harmony Pharmacy owner Jeffrey Marchack, who lost his entire
inventory of $100,000 worth of drugs and merchandise, the episode
has meant a decision to install an iron grille in the front window
and a cashier's cage.
   Such security measures didn't seem necessary before, he said
nostalgically, because ``we were always known to be happy-go-lucky,
peace-loving people.''
   ``The myth of exceptionalism has been blown apart,'' said Selwyn
Ryan, a sociologist and political pollster at the University of the
West Indies. ``The myth that we're a nonviolent society is just
that - a myth.''
   Industry Minister Bhoe Tewarie said Bakr and his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) were a ``group of extremists''
with no popular support. ``And I think Trinidad and Tobago proved
to the world that it is a very stable democracy that was threatened
but never shaken by the events of July 27.''
   But fearing that supporters of Bakr and 113 other jailed rebels
might be plotting another attack, the government has extended a
state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation gives
security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   By day, the capital of Port-of-Spain once again teems with
shoppers, street vendors and clogged traffic. Residents are growing
tired of being restricted to their homes at night under a 9
p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.
   ``We cannot expect that their sense of humor, which as been
bearing up quite nicely until now, can be maintained for undefined
periods,'' the Trinidad Guardian said in an editorial urging an end
to the curfew.
   Police, usually armed only with billy clubs in this former
British colony, now patrol with automatic rifles. Soldiers wearing
berets and camouflage jungle fatigues guard the bullet-scarred
Parliament building and television station.
   The capital's major hotels are open, but with mostly empty
rooms.
   Bulldozers and dump trucks remove tons of rubble from the main
shopping district, where fires destroyed almost every building in a
two-square-block area.
   The government is offering business loans and planning to
redesign the district, which had become badly rundown.
   But rebuilding could take months, if not years.
   Industry Minister Tewarie insists the coup attempt would not
have any lasting affect the economy. Tourism was hurt in the short
term, he said, but the industry accounts for a tiny proportion of
the nation's wealth.
   Despite the boom in oil prices, Tewarie said, the government has
no plans to significantly increase production because it is wary of
increasing its dependence on oil income.
   Trinidad has been gripped by recession since oil prices
collapsed in 1983. Bakr, 48, a former policeman who converted to
Islam and drew followers mainly among poor urban blacks, blamed
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson for the widespread poverty that
resulted.
   Robinson, 64, was shot in the left leg after the takeover of
Parliament. He has returned to work and now walks with a cane.
   The prime minister, who had introduced wage freezes, spending
cuts and layoffs to revitalize the economy, had become highly
unpopular before the coup attempt. He remains in danger of losing
the next election, due next year.
   Bakr and his men face a string of charges, including murder and
treason, which carry the death penalty. A preliminary hearing was
to begin today in a converted gym.
   The FBI has charged an American Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano
Beach, Fla., with supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other
equipment to the coup leaders.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and the chief negotiator for Moslem extremists said Monday
they have reached agreement to end a 4-day-old hostage siege.
   Robinson is one of 41 hostages reported held since Friday by
black Moslem extremists led by Abu Bakr.
   Justice and National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson,
speakig from inside Parliament where the uprising began, said the
agreement called for Robinson's immediate resignation with
elections to be held within 90 days.
   Richardson said the government had granted amnesty to the Moslem
radicals involved in the insurgency, which has left at least nine
people dead, according to officials.
   Speaking by telephone from inside Parliament, Robinson said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. Joe Theodore, head of
the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator Bilal Abdullah, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister Robinson has just said.''
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams reported earlier Monday that
the Moslems were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and
grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, Williams said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since Friday. He said Anglican
negotiator Knolly Clarke told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   Trinidad is just off northeast Venezuela, and is a former
British colony that gained independence in 1962. It has been
wracked in recent years by declining oil revenues and economic
doldrums, including high unemployment.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur Robinson
offered Sunday to resign and call early elections if black Moslem
rebels free him and about 30 other hostages and end their coup
attempt, an official said.
   At least 27 people have reportedly been killed in the violence.
However, there was no official toll.
   Robinson apparently made his offer as he and other government
officials remained wired to explosives and threatened with death.
They were taken captive Friday when several hundred rebels with
automatic weapons seized control of broadcast buildings and the
Parliament.
   Government radio said the rebels were optimistic about reaching
a settlement with Robinson but that they also wanted immunity from
prosecution.
   However, Energy Minister Herbert Atwell appeared on national
television late Sunday with an official statement offering no hope
for a quick settlement.
   ``I am in no position to offer any hope that the situation will
be resolved speedily and-or amicably,'' Atwell said. ``The
situation in Parliament remains a touch-and-go one with relation to
the hostages and their captors,'' he added.
   Acting Police Commissioner Leonard Taylor announced during the
same broadcast that joint police and military patrols had been
dispatched to control widespread looting along the 25-mile-long
corridor from the capital to its international airport and outlying
communities.
   A journalist who was inside the Parliament building when it was
stormed said Sunday the rebels shot Robinson in the leg and also
shot in the leg the minister of justice, Selwyn Richardson. The two
were being treated by Minister of Health Emmanuel Husin, a medical
doctor who was in the building.
   The journalist, released by the rebels Saturday night, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   State-run Radio 610 said Nolli Clarke, an Anglican priest, was
assisting in the negotiations at the Parliament. Hundreds of
government troops were patrolling around the building.
   Coup leader Abu Bakr, a former policeman in his mid-40s, claims
Robinson's government is corrupt and undemocratic. He said on
television Friday that the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and
the destruction'' of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation with
high unemployment and skyrocketing food prices.
   As negotiations continued Sunday, the Port-of-Spain area was
beset by fires, scattered shooting and widespread looting in some
areas.
   Hundreds of looters ransacked stores and factories in several
eastern suburbs, making off with food, refrigerators, videocassette
recorders and television sets. Some loaded their cars with stolen
goods and drove off.
   Looters also hit the five-square-block downtown shopping
district, where damage and losses were estimated at $50 million,
Radio 610 reported. It did not say how the figure was calculated.
   Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah broadcast an appeal for the
looting to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said. ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to
take away items like refrigerators, television sets and videos,
that is not right.''
   A spokeswoman for President Bush, who was in Kennebunkport,
Maine, said Saturday that he was ``following the situation
carefully'' and that American citizens and tourists on Trinidad and
Tobago did not appear to be in danger.
   A government curfew, imposed Saturday by a state of emergency
that mobilized the country's 5,000-member army and 1,500-member
police force, was extended Sunday to 18 hours, from 6 p.m. to noon.
   Some of the 11 Americans staying at the harbor-side Holiday Inn
three blocks from the Parliament building said they were more bored
as a result of the curfew restrictions than afraid of the violence.
   ``Unfortunately, I came at the wrong time. There's nothing to
do. The hotel is nice, but I didn't come here to sit inside a hotel
doing nothing,'' said Rhonda Isaacs, a native of Guyana now living
in New York City.
   Ms. Isaacs said her two children, 11 and 13, have been spending
their time swimming in the hotel pool or watching television. The
family had intended to return home from a three-week vacation on
Aug. 9, but now wanted to leave as soon as possible, she said.
   Radio 610 said ``scores'' of people had been injured in fighting
associated with the coup. The Red Cross urgently appealed for blood
donations to treat the wounded, but most residents were too afraid
to leave their homes.
   An administrator at the Port-au-Spain General Hospital said at
least five people wounded during the overthrow attempt died Sunday.
   The Caribbean News Agency, quoting police and hospital sources,
said on Saturday that at least 22 people have died in fighting
since the coup attempt began, but exactly where the fighting
occurred remained unclear.
   The offer Robinson reportedly made to the rebels was described
by Jones Madeira, director of the government television station and
himself a hostage.
   Madeira said in a telephone interview from a television station
seized by the rebels that Robinson agreed to turn over power to an
interim government that would rule until elections are held in
three months.
   Robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide and
the next elections were not scheduled until 1991.
   ``My information is that Prime Minister Robinson has agreed to
step down and that an interim government of major political parties
will run the country until elections are held in 90 days,'' he said.
   The rebels were holding Robinson with several Cabinet ministers
in the Red House. Madeira said he and 30 other employees were being
held at the television station, which is several miles north of the
Parliament, known as Red House.
   He said 10 other people were inside of Radio Trinidad in a
building near the TV station, but it was unclear if they were being
held captive, as reported earlier, or whether they were staying
inside because of snipers.
   Bakr heads a group of about 250 black Moslems called Jamaat
al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic.
   Bakr lives in Canada for several years in the early 1980s, where
he took up Islam and worked for a while with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. He returned to Trinidad in 1984, said Haroon
Salamat, head of the Toronto and Region Islamic Congregation.
   Bakr's group had formed its own paramilitary squad to raid known
drug dealers, Salamat said.
   Salamat told the Toronto Star that he thinks the coup attempt
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.
   ``All of this _ drugs and social justice _ has concerned him
because he saw the government just ignore the problems. He must
have thought that drastic action was necessary.''
   Moslems, most of them East Indians, make up about 6 percent of
the population of 1.3 million people of the Caribbean nation off
Venezuela.
   The general population is mainly Hindu and Christian and is
about 40 percent East Indian and 40 percent of African descent.
   Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony, suffered serious
economic decline in the 1980s as the world price for oil, the main
export, plummeted.
   Unemployment is estimated at around 22 percent and food prices
have skyrocketed by about 25 percent in the past year.
   On Saturday, Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin talked
with Bakr by telephone. Afterward, Pantin quoted Bakr as saying the
prime minister and the hostages at the Parliament building ``are
wired up with explosives.'' Pantin said the rebels threatened to
blow up the captives if government troops move on the building.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook people
awake on the Caribbean island of Trinidad early today but police
said they had no reports of injuries or damage.
   The quake, the strongest in the area in 78 years, measured 6.9
on the Richter scale and struck at 2:17 a.m. about 50 miles
southeast of the capital of Port-of-Spain, said the U.S. Geological
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   ``No damage, no injuries. We just got a little shake and that's
all,'' said Lt. Velfukr Muhammed at police headquarters in the
capital of 55,800 people.
   ``I was in bed at the time and that woke me and everyone else in
the house,'' said Lionel Dixon, news editor of Radio Trinidad in
Port-of-Spain.
   A security guard at the station, San Keralli, said the building
shook for about 40 seconds. Dixon said some people ran into the
street in the suburb where he lives.
   Frank Baldwin, a USGS physical science technician in Golden,
said the epicenter appeared to have been in the Caribbean about 420
miles east of Caracas, Venezuela, in a seismic area lying on the
boundary between the Caribbean and the South American crustal
plates of the Earth.
   The quake was the area's largest since a magnitude 7.2 temblor
on Jan. 23, 1910.
   Trinidad is an island in the republic of Trinidad and Tobago, a
member of the British Commonwealth. About 1.2 million people live
in the oil-producing republic, which covers an area about the size
of Delaware and is one of the Caribbean's most prosperous countries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Soldiers removed seven more
bodies Friday from a bombed police station, the Parliament and a TV
building, raising to at least 38 the death toll from a failed coup
attempt and subsequent looting.
   Moslem extremists held hostages for six days before surrendering
Wednesday.
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams said seven additional bodies
were recovered by noon from wrecked buildings.
   Authorities also said that a fire of undetermined origin
destroyed a storage area and an apartment Thursday night at the
Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune's compound on the outskirts of
Port-of-Spain, the capital of this Caribbean island.
   Abu Bakr, the commune's leader, and 112 of his followers were
being held at army headquarters after giving up on Wednesday and
releasing their remaining 46 hostages. Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and several of his Cabinet ministers were among the total
of 55 hostages held by the rebels.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw has said the militants could
face a variety of charges, including murder, kidnapping and
treason, which carries the death penalty.
   Shaw said Jazeni Omowale, a 21-year-old student from Howard
University in Washington, D.C., had been killed Wednesday in a
gunfight involving police and soldiers in the capital's Champs
Fleurs suburb. He was believed to be Bakr's stepson. The
circumstances of the gunfight were unknown.
   For the first time since the siege began on July 27, soldiers
entered the Parliament building.
   Williams said the bodies of three civilians and one rebel were
removed from the building, along with homemade grenades and about
40 handguns.
   He said two other bodies were pulled from the rubble of the
police station. The building was demolished by a car bomb and fire
during the siege.
   A seventh body, that of a rebel, was discovered at the
government's television station, where 29 employees were held
captive. Police sealed off the television station to search for any
explosives left by rebels.
   Shaw said earlier at least 30 people were killed in the initial
assault by Bakr and his men and in subsequent looting. The
discovery of the bodies Friday and the killing of the American
student brought the total to 38.
   Lennox Williams, administrator of Port-of-Spain General
Hospital, said autopsies found at least 14 people died of gunshot
wounds. He said most were killed by security forces during looting.
   A state of emergency remained in effect Friday and soldiers and
police patrolled the capital. An 18-hour curfew was reduced to 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., however, and Shaw said banks would open Sunday to
help residents resume normal business as soon as possible.
   A 150-member regional force was dispatched to this island nation
of more than 1.2 million to guard installations and relieve the
local forces for patrols.
   Food and medical supplies were being flown in from the United
States, Canada and nearby Venezuela.

  [Text] A Trinidadian drug cartel involving hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of cocaine in monthly shipments 
between Colombia and the United States and Britain via Trinidad 
has been broken in Venezuela with the arrest of its leader on a 
beach in the mainland republic. 
  George Simeon, leader of a cartel called "Los Trinitarios" 
(The Trinidadians), was captured on the beach in Sucre State as 
he received samples of what General Julio C. Pena Sanchez of the 
Venezuelan Guardia Nacional described as a future shipment of 
high quality cocaine. 
  The cartel was said to have been shipping between 500 and 
1,000 kilos of cocaine, worth between TT$175 and TT$350 million, 
monthly from Colombia through Venezuela via Trinidad to points 
in the Caribbean and North Atlantic. 
  The arrest of the group was the leading item in Venezuela's 
largest-selling newspaper, EL NACIONAL last Wednesday. Simeon, a 
Trindadian, was arrested along with other members of the cartel 
who were held simultaneously in other parts of the country in a 
massive Guardia Nacional exercise which also resulted in the 
seizure of six vehicles. 
  General Pena Sanchez, Operations Commander of the Guardia 
Nacional, announced the arrests last Tuesday, following the 
events which occurred on Saturday, November 6. 
  He said the arrests had been the result of seven months of 
investigations and surveillance by the joint armed forces aimed 
at breaking the cartel, which was based in Maracaibo in Zulia 
state and had a network which spread across several states in 
Venezuela. 
  A total of 165 officers of the Guardia Nacional took part in 
the raid which captured Simeon and a Venezuelan national on the 
Sucre beach. Other members of the drug network were captured in 
Maracaibo, Zulia, Acarigua, Portuguesa and Rio Caribe. The 
Guardia Nacional has traced the drug route from Cali, Cucuta, 
Colombia; to Urena, Tachira, Acarigua, Carupano, Sucre and Rio 
Caribe in Venezuela, and then to Trinidad. 
  Since then, in an apparently unrelated case, another 
Trinidadian, Wharfe Ashton, Alton, has been arrested on drug 
trafficking charges after the intelligence arm of the police 
service monitored a drug shipment bound for Miami. Alton was 
shot in the leg as he tried to escape. 
  The big Venezuelan drug bust is the second major report in a 
week involving the discovery of multi-million drug operations in 
which Trinidadians were implicated. 
  Grenada Coast Guard intercepted an inter-island vessel on 
November 5, the same day of the Venezuelan operations, and 
found 60 kilos of cocaine hidden in a cargo of furniture. The 
boat had left Port of Spain the afternoon before. An Arima man, 
Sylvon Liverpool, was arrested together with five others.

Muslim rebels still held the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago and at least 
38 other hostages Sunday as negotiations to end the twin-island nation's crisis 
stalled amid reports of widespread looting and an early morning gun battle at 
one of the hostage sites. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies, quoting an executive of Trinidad's state-owned television 
station, said that Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson had offered to resign and 
call early elections in return for the hostages' freedom. But there was no 
confirmation of that report from other government sources. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Muslim group attempting the coup said that a final 
agreement on amnesty for the armed rebels was close. But a government source 
quoted by the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) in Barbados said that the 
negotiations were snagged over legal terms and by reservations being voiced by 
Trinidad's police and armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
No further mention was made Sunday of reports that Robinson and other hostages 
had been wired to explosive devices and threatened with death in the event of 
any armed rescue attempt. Robinson and 11 Cabinet ministers and members of 
Parliament are captives inside Trinidad's Red House, the Parliament building in 
downtown Port of Spain, the capital. Between 26 and 28 other captives are being 
held in two buildings of the state-run Trinidad and Tobago Television and Radio 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
A gun battle between the police and members of the armed Jamaat al Muslimeen 
rebel group broke out early Sunday at the television station, CANA reported. It 
quoted the station's news director, Jones P. Madeira, himself a hostage, as 
saying that two of the Muslims were wounded. A shortwave radio broadcast, 
purportedly made by Robinson, appealed for a cease-fire, CANA said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also quoted extensively from an interview with Yasin abu Bakr, 
leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, Arabic for "Group of Muslims," in which he 
denied "malicious propaganda" that his movement was supported by Libya's 
radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, and that the rebels had asked to be flown 
to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to Libya for?" the CANA interview quoted Abu Bakr as asking. 
"We are all Trinidadians, that is why we are here, that is why we are fighting 
in any case, because it is our country. There is nothing to do with Libya." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone to CANA from the television station, Abu Bakr said that 
the armed uprising was launched because "something had to shock us into 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The offer that Robinson reportedly made to step down and call early elections 
was described by TV news director Madeira, according to an Associated Press 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"My information is that Prime Minister Robinson has agreed to step down and 
that an interim government of major political parties will run the country 
until elections are held in 90 days," Madeira was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the parliamentary elections by a landslide in 1986, and the next 
elections are not scheduled until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr's group of 200 to 250 followers and their families, organized about 
six years ago, has long been viewed with suspicion by the government as violent 
outlaws. Abu Bakr, a former police officer in his mid-40s, has in turn accused 
the government of corruption, squandering state money and failing to focus on 
hunger and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Robinson, who was shot in the leg when he refused to sign a 
document that some reports described as a letter of resignation, Abu Bakr told 
CANA, "All is well at the Red House," the Parliament building where the prime 
minister and other officials are held captive. "There has been a great spirit 
of compromise between our members and Mr. Robinson and some of the members of 
Parliament," Abu Bakr was quoted as saying. "Hopefully the country will be back 
on its feet in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
Two other political leaders, National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson and 
Parliament member Leo Des Vignes also were shot in the legs, according to a 
news report from Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials said that U.S. and Trinidadian officials have 
consulted in the past two days on the possibility of sending State Department 
experts in hostage negotiations to the island. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Sean Walsh said Sunday that the United States is "willing 
to entertain any proposal by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, and will 
examine any request carefully." But Walsh said that Trinidad has made no formal 
requests for assistance and that officials in Washington believe that Trinidad 
hopes to resolve the crisis itself. 
</P>
<P>
Any U.S. military assistance was considered highly unlikely, officials said, 
both because Trinidad is not likely to request such help and because Washington 
probably would not approve such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ransacking and pillaging of stores and shopping centers in what 
has become the virtual no man's land of downtown Port of Spain continued 
Sunday, according to news reports reaching here. Acting Police Commissioner 
Leonard Taylor acknowledged that "our best efforts haven't provided the desired 
results," but he warned of "stronger measures which will certainly be injurious 
to some citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In a radio appeal to end the looting, Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah said he 
had been told that whole convoys of vehicles were loading up on refrigerators 
and videos. 
</P>
<P>
A Port of Spain businessman was quoted as complaining that too many of the tiny 
island country's 1,500 military troops and 5,000 police were concentrated at 
the hostage sites, leaving the city wide open to the looters. As the crisis 
entered its third day, he estimated losses at more than $50 million. At least 
27 people, including police and military personnel, have reportedly been killed 
in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Abdullah, Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin and Anglican 
clergyman Knolly Clarke have been acting as middlemen in the negotiations 
between the Muslim group and the government. In exchange for ending the crisis 
peacefully, the rebels reportedly have asked for a total amnesty, including 
legal pardons from the Commonwealth country's president. 
</P>
<P>
"All the principles have been agreed, and the final arrangements for conducting 
the amnesty are being concluded with the assistance of Archbishop of Port of 
Spain Pantin and Anglican Bishop Abdullah," said the Muslim group's spokesman, 
Bilal Abdullah, in a telephone interview with CANA from the TV station. 
</P>
<P>
A strict 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew continued in Port of Spain. Although Piarco 
International Airport, the country's main link to the outside world, was 
technically reopened during daylight hours Sunday, international and local 
Caribbean airlines refused to resume service until the crisis is resolved. 
Charter pilots on nearby Caribbean islands such as Barbados and Grenada also 
refused to fly to Port of Spain.

<F P=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Drug Bust Mystery: Why Always </F>
Abroad?"] 
  [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an 
unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming 
from Trinidad and Tobago take place outside this country's 
territory. 
  Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with 
clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place 
everywhere--in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina; 
Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada--but here. 
  Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins 
and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went 
unreturned up to late Friday. 
  Law enforcement sources said in both shipping 
incidents--involving the methanol tanker Harold La 
Borde and the schooner Let Me Live--local police 
had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined 
total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels 
in places outside Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Ministry of National Security has gone a step further 
and 
rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration 
between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an 
official government press release. 
  Despite this, no one could say why, if information was 
available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and 
on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by 
local narcotics or Coast Guard officers, instead of allowing the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Grenada Coast 
Guard to break those two smuggling operations. 
  In the case of the Harold La Borde the DEA gave 
credit to a local informant who was paid "good money" by the US 
counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to 
the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians. 
  Pierre Sharette, assistant special agent of the DEA Miami 
office with responsibility for the Caribbean, told the SUNDAY 
EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no 
connection to law enforcement agencies. 
  Current bids for credit by local officials recall the 
episode 
two years ago when the Narcotics Bureau claimed credit for the 
Florida arrest by US authorities of Paul Mansoor with five 
kilograms of cocaine. 
  Vexed by the false claim, a US source later told this 
newspaper that Mansoor was picked up in Miami because he was 
acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the 
T&amp;T police. 
  Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a 
"controlled delivery"--the reason, some people believe, for the 
failure of local authorities to act on the information here. 
  In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off 
the DEA, who in turn alerted the Grenada Coast Guard that drugs 
were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the 
schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the 
drugs but allowed the ship to leave the Caricom jetty and sail 
clear out of T&amp;T waters has not been explained. 
  A top policeman would say only that "we were aware of it 
(drugs on board the schooner)." Pressed further, he said: "The 
information is very sensitive." 
  He claimed that authorities here "are aware of the local 
connection" in both drug runs. He added only that: "We have an 
idea what's going on (in the drug business)." 
  He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local 
dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the 
arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on 
outbound flights at Piarco International Airport and low-level 
street dealers. 
  Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in Germany 
with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on BWIA 
flight 980--Port of Spain to Frankfurt. 
  Suspicions created since charges last year about a police 
"drug cartel" have slowed the sharing of information even 
between the newly created narcotics unit and Selman's OSS. Each 
agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and 
sharing it "on a need to know basis only." 
  There is no explanation either why there are no busts for 
drugs coming into Trinidad and Tobago, or how much of 
what comes in remains here. 
  Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace 
with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by 
traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major 
shift in US drug policy. 
  The Clinton administration announced it will slash drug 
interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the 
Caribbean and pump more aid to South America to fight cocaine at 
the source. 
  Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that Trinidad and 
Tobago 
is being used as a "staging area" by the Medellin and Cali 
cartels to move drugs to Europe and North America. 
  Sharette said DEA intelligence indicates that single and 
twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in Trinidad 
and Tobago territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for 
repackaging and shipping to Europe and North America. 
  Meanwhile, despite Huggins' vow to get tough, cocaine 
cartels 
continue to bring their drugs into Trinidad and Tobago and, as 
evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some 
of it out.

  [Text] Witnesses in drug cases in Trinidad and Tobago are 
so easily bought off that the Ministry of National Security is 
putting focus on the seizure of drugs outside of Trinidad and 
Tobago as a deliberate policy. 
  This was stated by National Security Minister Russell 
Huggins 
in the Senate yesterday. 
  Noting that there was criticism that the big drug busts were 
not taking place in Trinidad and Tobago, but outside, Huggins 
said the seizing of drugs outside of Trinidad was "an 
intentional act." 
  "Witnesses (in Trinidad and Tobago) are being bought off as 
easy as it is to buy a soft drink in a parlour. We start a case, 
we have four state witnesses and by the time the matter comes 
up, you can't find any of them. They are in the United States 
living it up," he said. 
  He explained that as a result of this the Ministry had taken 
a particular approach to the busting of drug deals. 
  "When we find out about it (we arrange) to have it seized 
outside of Trinidad and not inside," he said, adding: 
  "We will work with agencies outside of Trinidad and Tobago 
and I can tell you that it was largely as a result of our effort 
that a drug link between this country and Venezuela was 
destroyed recently." 
  Huggins noted that one of the main perpetrators, a 
Trinidadian received a 10-year jail sentence within eight days 
of his arrest. 
  "Now that is the kind of swift justice I will like to see 
here. But we have skilled lawyers who know how to delay justice 
when it suits them," he added. 
  The Minister also referred to a recent bust "as far as 
Holland" in which both the narcotic units here and the OSS 
(Organisation of Strategic Services) played an important role in 
the discovery of shipment of drugs on board a British Airways 
craft leaving Piarco. 
  Huggins noted that the task of preventing drugs from coming 
into Trinidad and Tobago was far more difficult. Those who 
import cocaine have a lot of opportunity to do so, he said, 
adding that the south-eastern coast, given the present size of 
our Coast Guard, was impossible to patrol on a full-time basis. 
  He recalled that only recently the Coast Guard had acquired 
boats with the capability to chase the small fast boats used by 
drug traffickers. 
  Turning to the Point Lisas Port, he noted that it was 
virtually impossible to search 1,000 containers. 
  "The only way you can do it is by random checks and a 
container may slip by and the government and the security at 
Point Lisas are blamed," he noted. 
  He said that while Point Lisas had put in a very good system 
to deal with that, it was virtually impossible to completely 
eradicate the problem. 
  He stressed that good intelligence in detecting the drugs 
was 
still the best option and urged citizens to assist the 
authorities in this regard. 
  Huggins said the U.S. Government had provided govenrment 
with 
US$303,000; the Canadian Government $1 million, the French 
Government had given technical assistance as did the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. 
  But, he stressed, foreign assistance was extremely difficult 
to access. "Although public pronouncements are made that some 
governments are providing assistance, because of the bureaucracy 
involved, that assistance is extremely difficult to get our 
hands on," he said. 
  He said on regional basis--Caribbean Financial Action Task 
Force--was established to deal with the problem of money 
laundering.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A failed coup attempt by Moslem
extremists and widespread looting that resulted left at least 30
people dead and 150 wounded in Trinidad, a government spokesman
said today.
   The authorities expect to find more bodies in Parliament, where
the prime minister and other government ministers were held
hostage, and in a police station that was gutted by a car-bomb and
fire, spokesman Gregory Shaw said.
   Previous reports had said about 20 people died in the coup
attempt, which began Friday with a raid on Parliament and a
government TV station.
   Shaw also confirmed for the first time that Prime Minister N.R.
Robinson, after being shot in the leg, signed agreements to resign,
turn over power to a caretaker government and grant amnesty to the
rebels.
   ``All the agreements were signed under duress, all under
gunpoint, all of which are completely invalid,'' Shaw told
reporters at a news conference.
   Shaw said that the coup leader, Abu Bakr, and his band of 111
militants had dropped their demands before surrendering on
Wednesday and releasing their remaining 46 hostages. A total of 55
hostages had been held.
   ``They caved in completely,'' he said. ``They surrendered
unconditionally.
   Officials have said they will press charges against Bakr and
those who joined him in the coup attempt.
   Shaw said soldiers expect to go into Parliament and the nearby
police station on Friday to search for bodies and unexploded bombs.
Soldiers standing outside the buildings said they were waiting one
day to go inside because of fears of time-delayed explosives.
   The security forces also evacuated 2,000 to 3,000 people from
the vicinity of the government television station, where 29
hostages were held after the building was seized last Friday. That
building also will be searched.
   Shaw said the dead included looters shot by the security forces,
but he gave no breakdown.
   The capital was quiet this morning. People remained indoors,
under a 6 p.m. to noon curfew that remained in effect.
   State radio said Leo des Vignes, a junior government minister
taken hostage Friday and released a day later, died of a heart
attack Wednesday in a hospital. He had been shot in the heel.
   Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran said Wednesday that
``appropriate charges'' would be brought against the militants.
   Asked whether the charges would include murder and treason,
Dookeran said it would be up to the judicial authorities to decide.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam and considers
himself a champion of the downtrodden, was under heavy guard along
with the other 111 rebels at army headquarters in Chaguerames in
northwest Trinidad.
   The freed hostages spent the night at Camp Ogden, another army
base near the capital of Port-of-Spain, for medical exams and
treatment.
   Bakr had demanded Robinson's ouster, accusing him of corruption
and blaming him for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich
Caribbean nation of 1.3 million people.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed Tuesday and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the attack as
well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The defense chief, Col. Joe Theodore, said Bakr had agreed to
surrender Tuesday night, four days after the siege began.
   ``I just think they were worn down,'' he said of the rebels.
``They just wanted out. They had come to the conclusion they had
failed.''
   The defense chief said the rebels had agreed to leave all their
explosives and ammunition on the speaker's table in the Parliament
building.
   Officials said the rebels had been armed with AK-47 assault
rifles, vintage World War II rifles, pump-action shotguns, pistols
and grenades.
   The coup attempt began Friday when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and others captive. They also bombed and
burned down the police station.
   The attack set off a wave of looting.
   Hundreds of people took to the streets, ransacking stores and
warehouses and carrying away everything from food to television
sets. Damage was estimated at $50 million and food and medicine
were beginning to run short. It was the country's worst violence
since a black power uprising in the early 1970s.
   Dookeran said a state of emergency, including the islandwide
curfew, would remain in effect until the country gets back to
normal.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem militants surrendered
today and began freeing their 42 hostages, ending a six-day coup
attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly
left at least 20 people dead.
   The 25 people who had been held hostage since Friday at the
government television station left the building one by one, were
searched in the middle of the street by soldiers, then taken away
on an army bus, state radio said.
   A short time later, the leader of the coup attempt, Abu Bakr,
and about 50 rebels left the building, dropped their weapons in the
street, put their hands behind their heads, and surrendered to
soldiers, witnesses said.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said another group of soldiers
was heading over to the Parliament building, about a mile away, to
take the remaining rebels into custody and evacuate their 17
hostages, who included seven Cabinet ministers and other officials.
   Shaw said it was his understanding that Bakr and his group of
about 100 Moslem extremists had surrendered unconditionally.
   The hostages initially included the prime minister, Arthur N.R.
Robinson, but he was freed on Tuesday after offering to step down,
call new elections and grant the rebels amnesty. It was not
immediately clear whether the government would fulfill that pledge
since it was made while Robinson was held captive.
   Details of the final negotiations that produced the rebel
agreement to surrender and free all their hostages were not
immediately available.
   Earlier today, Bakr had described the coup attempt as a ``small
family squabble'' and said that an accord had been reached to end
the standoff.
   Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
from the Caribbean nation, Bakr had indicated that the hostages
would be freed soon.
   ``The negotiations are over. We already have a signed
agreement,'' he told the BBC. ``We are making preparations now for
the evacuation of all the people, all the people at the television
house and the people who are at the Parliament building.''
   At least 20 people were reportedly killed in fighting and
looting associated with the coup attempt. The capital was reported
quiet today, but a government spokesman said there were explosions
overnight.
   ``It's very calm,'' said the spokesman, Bernard Pantin. He said
he did not know the cause of the explosions but said they were not
near the Parliament or the television station, where the captives
were being held.
   Bakr had blamed Robinson for widespread poverty in the once
oil-rich nation of 1.3 million people near Venezuela. He said in
today's interview he was seeking a ``new beginning in Trinidad.''
   Bakr's Jamaat al-Muslimeen group, which means the Moslem Group
in Arabic, was founded in 1984 and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from Libya.
   The U.S. Ambassador, Charles Gargano, said no sign of popular
support surfaced for Bakr's extremist sect.
   ``This is not a revolution,'' he said. ``It is a hostage
situation.''
   Although Bakr said in the BBC interview that everyone being held
by his followers would be freed, he also denied that the people
were in fact hostages.
   ``We don't have any hostages, sir. We never had any hostages,''
he told the BBC interviewer. ``You'll have to rephrase that
question.''
   Asked whether the people in question were then free to leave,
Bakr responded: ``There's a curfew. They can't walk about in a
curfew.''
   A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew remained in effect throughout most of
Trinidad following earlier widespread looting.
   When the interviewer expressed disbelief that only the curfew
was stopping the prisoners from leaving, Bakr also mentioned that
bus service had been disrupted.
   He said of the coup attempt, ``It was a small family squabble...
I'm saying that emphatically.''
   Robinson was allowed Tuesday to leave the besieged Parliament
building. It was not clear whether he would continue as prime
minister.
   Fifteen government officials were held hostage in the Parliament
building and 25 others in the government TV station.
   At least nine people were killed when Bakr and his followers
took over both buildings on Friday. Robinson, 63, was hospitalized
for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover, as well as
for exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The government had said earlier that Robinson was shot in both
feet. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   Smart would not discuss the conditions under which Robinson was
freed, or say whether his health was a factor. Bakr said in today's
interview that Robinson was freed as a ``humanitarian gesture.''
   Gargano, interviewed before Robinson's release, said the
government remained united and in control. He said Robinson's
deputy, Winston Dookeran, and eight other ministers who escaped
rebel capture were running Trinidad.
   Smart said the government continued to enjoy the ``complete
loyalty'' of the 1,500-member military and 5,000-member police
force.
   In a joint telephone call Monday night from inside Parliament,
Robinson, Bakr's chief negotiator, Bilal Abdullah, and Minister of
Justice and National Security Selwyn Richardson all said a
settlement had been reached.
   Richardson said the agreement called for Robinson to resign and
for elections to be held within 90 days. But government spokesman
Gregory Shaw said there was no agreement: ``These are statements of
people being held at gunpoint. People are made to make statements.''

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 8 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and 
Tobago's police commissioner, Jules Bernard, has issued a stern 
warning to Muslim leader Yasin Abu Bakr [name as received], 
whose followers staged a coup attempt here in 1990. 
  "I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as 
the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law 
and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action 
to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and 
tranquility of the society," Bernard said after Abu Bakr said 
his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the 
insurrection. 
  "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to 
embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the 
police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such 
activities." 
  Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction 
over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the 
judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at 
Mucurapo in the northern township of St James. 
  The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options 
open 
to it regarding the land dispute with the government. 
  "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The 
government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we 
would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option 
available to us," he told reporters. 
  He said that the organisation was not doing anything to 
create tension. 
  Abu Bakr added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like 
to 
defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the 
1990 insurrection." 
  The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in 1990, 
complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and 
113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in 
1992 after a high court found that an amnesty which they 
received from acting President Emmanuel Carter was valid. 
  Previous governments and the Muslimeen have been at 
loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually 
ended up in the courts. 
  Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state 
had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several 
buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire, 
shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.

   The United States is preparing
emergency assistance for this beleaguered Caribbean country, but
there are no plans to send military reinforcements, the U.S.
ambassador said Tuesday.
   ``We haven't been asked and we aren't considering any type of
military support,'' Ambassador Charles Gargano said at the U.S.
Embassy, a few blocks from the state Television House where a
radical Moslem group has held hostages since Friday.
   The group also seized the Parliament House and is holding
hostages there, including government officials. Prime Minister
Arthur N.R. Robinson was freed Tuesday, five days after being
seized, the attorney general said.
   Because of widespread looting, Trinidad could face food
shortages, and the United States is preparing emergency supplies,
Gargano said.
   He said a force of some 200 Caribbean soldiers were standing by
on Barbados to help if requested.
   The ambassador, who has been staying in the Embassy along with
12 other diplomatic personnel and six Marine guards, said he is in
regular contact with Trinidadian officials.
   He said there are no signs of splintering in the government or
security forces, and there is no popular support for the rebels.
   ``The government is in total control of the country,'' he said.
   Gargano, named in 1987, said the crisis ``came out of the blue
for us. In fact, we were quite shocked. This country appeared to be
a model of democracy.''
   The U.S. stakes here are high, he said. He said there are 2,000
to 4,000 U.S. citizens in Trinidad, including many Trinidadians who
hold dual citizenship.
   Trinidad is a major U.S. trade partner in the Caribbean and has
been a pro-American democracy for its three decades of nationhood,
he said.
   ``Things have been moving apace in terms of democratization in
this hemisphere. We would like to see it continue as a strong
democracy,'' Gargano said.
   He said the Moslem group led by former Trinidad policeman Abu
Bakr has been controversial in Trinidad and has made anti-American
statements.
   ``Our impression is that it was a tiny fanatical sect,'' he
said, estimating Bakr's followers at 250 to 350 people.
   He said some members of the group have traveled to Libya and
``there is some evidence of training given to some members.'' He
said they also have received funding from Libya. But Gargano added
there was no evidence of Libyan involvement in their move against
the government.

Captive Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson, suffering a festering leg wound and 
imperiled eyesight, was released by black Muslim rebels Tuesday, but 40 other 
hostages were still being held as efforts to free them dragged into a fifth day 
without progress. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing prime minister was led to an ambulance in front of Red House, the 
twin-island nation's besieged Parliament building, by one of his captors and 
another hostage, according to Atty. Gen. Anthony Smart, a senior member of the 
Cabinet team that has been negotiating with the rebels via radio, telephone and 
a clergyman intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was taken first to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden, then to an 
unidentified hospital, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Robinson "is in good spirits," but he is reported to be suffering from 
an apparently infected gunshot wound in one leg. Robinson also reportedly is 
experiencing eye problems resulting from his lack of glaucoma medication since 
the Parliament building was seized by the rebels in a coup attempt Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Smart refused to give details of the talks that led to Robinson's freedom, but 
he indicated that the release did not represent a breakthrough in the overall 
hostage negotiations, which ran aground after near-agreement Monday. A 
government spokesman, Gregory Shaw, said the hostage takers' "demands are 
escalating, and some of the demands are clearly impossible to meet." 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is far from over," Smart declared. 
</P>
<P>
The first hint of the surprise development Tuesday came in an early morning 
telephone conversation between the leader of the rebels and journalists. 
Speaking from the besieged Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, the 
chief hostage taker, Yasin abu Bakr, offered to release Robinson on 
humanitarian grounds, with no strings attached, "because he is sick." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Bakr virtually bombarded local and foreign reporters with phone 
calls to the government's temporary press headquarters in the Holiday Inn 
Hotel, a few blocks from Red House. The calls revealed a growing tone of 
desperation among his estimated 120 armed comrades and at least some captives. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Abu Bakr charged that a coterie of Cabinet ministers had 
torpedoed a signed agreement to end the crisis, which he contended was reached 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They have now pulled a new coup, and they are holding everyone ransom," Abu 
Bakr cried in an anxious, angry voice during one call several hours before 
Robinson's release. "They are blocking it because they want Mr. Robinson dead." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was not spelled out by Abu Bakr or government officials, but it 
reportedly included Robinson's pledge to resign; formation of an interim 
government including Abu Bakr, and total amnesty for the rebels, who are 
believed to have received military training and financial support from Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old former police officer, who founded the black Muslim group 
Jamaat al Muslimeen six years ago, called for former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter and the Rev. Jesse Jackson to come to Trinidad so he would have someone 
"straightforward" to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In another call to journalists, Abu Bakr complained that the police and army 
troops who have surrounded the two hostage sites are trying to starve his group 
into submission. He charged that the army ignored his calls for food and water 
until 3 a.m. Sunday, when they placed provisions in the street in front of the 
television building and dared the hostage takers to come out for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force also had tried to split the hostage 
takers by cutting off all lines of communication between the television 
buildings, where 25 of the captives are held, and Red House, where 15 remain at 
gunpoint, Abu Bakr contended. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Forces spokesman, Maj. Dave Williams, acknowledged that all lines 
to the two buildings have been cut and expressed astonishment that the rebel 
leader had secured a phone line to the press hotel. Abu Bakr explained that he 
had "a genius" in his group who engineered the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages, television news director Jones P. Madeira and reporter 
Raul Pantin, seconded Abu Bakr's agitated complaints when he passed the 
telephone to them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I spoke to the army yesterday afternoon, I said, 'Everybody's dying of 
starvation in here,' " Madeira recalled Tuesday. "What are they trying to do, 
get me killed?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives are threatened here, but not by the imam," said Pantin, using Abu 
Bakr's title as an Islamic religious leader. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked Abu Bakr if he is fearful of the outcome of the siege, he 
replied only: "Everyone will die at some time in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Charles A. Gargano provided some insight into the 
situation for five American journalists who visited the American Embassy on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his own contacts with the Trinidad and Tobago government concerning 
the crisis, Gargano said, "The last communication we had with the government 
(early Tuesday) is that they are still discussing the situation, and it has 
been going up and down." He expressed hope that a peaceful solution would be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Although declining to provide details of his conversations with local 
officials, Gargano said the Americans already are "looking at programs where we 
might be able to assist with such things as emergency food shipments." 
</P>
<P>
After a weekend of widespread looting, virtually all supermarkets and food 
shops in Port of Spain have been stripped bare, and a severe food shortage has 
developed.

<F P=106> [Article by Judy Diptee] </F>
  [Text] Foreign missions in Trinidad and Tobago have come 
together to assist the Government in tackling the illicit drug 
trade. 
  Officials at the French Embassy, the UK High Commission, the 
US Embassy and the Canadian High Commission said last week that 
they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements 
of the T&amp;T Government and how best they can each serve these 
needs. 
  The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange 
information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that 
efforts are not duplicated. 
  The French have been identified as the experts on money 
laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the US on 
drug interdiction and the British on training. 
  Jacques Venne, delegate for the Eastern Caribbean Technical 
and International Police Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the 
French Embassy, said that Trinidad and Tobago was designated the 
regional centre of SCTIP operations on September 27. Director of 
SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening 
on his way to Aruba to attend an Interpol Conference. 
  This country, he said, was chosen because of its 
geographical 
location and because of this Government's interest in dealing 
with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was 
closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Paris Government, he said, has already released "a good 
budget" for training a special team of police officers in money 
laundering, starting from the end of October. The officers are 
expected to undergo an intensive training session in Martinique. 
  Emphasising that his Embassy offers assistance on the basis 
of discussions with this Government, Venne said: "We are here as 
advisers, not to say what to do." 
  Head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Lance Selman 
pointed out that the Customs and Excise Division as well as the 
banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering. 
"One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering. 
In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he 
commented. 
  His office, Selman said, has been mandated to develop the 
capabilities to deal with money laundering. 
  Stating that his country's contribution has been "very 
modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner Jean Nadeau said on 
Friday that Canada has been offering participation in short-term 
observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained, 
involved exposure to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their 
drug control operations. 
  Two T&amp;T officers will be attending such a session later 
this 
month. Besides training sessions, Nadeau said, Canada has 
donated a small amount of communications equipment to the 
Ministry of National Security and has made a financial 
commitment to assist in the renovation of the Narcotics Unit. 
  Indirectly, the Canadian Government has also provided 
assistance to Trinidad and Tobago, he said, through a 1992 
contribution of Can$800,000 to the Inter-American Drug Control 
Commission (CICAD) and Can$2.5 million to the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). 
  Canada, said Nadeau, is also discussing with Trinidad and 
Tobago the setting up [of] a communications trunking system 
linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise. 
  Press officer at the British High Commission Simon Bond said 
that the UK is placing emphasis on training especially in money 
laundering within the Customs and Excise Division. 
  "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance 
to 
the police and Coast Guard. But more significant from the UK's 
point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of 
legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said. 
  Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective 
services, the US Government in August funded a US$18,000 drug 
prevention programme aimed at young people.

<F P=106> [Report by Linda Hutchinson] </F>
  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 25 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will accelerate its efforts to 
recover money owed to it by at least six Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) countries, a government minister reported Tuesday. 
  "This process was started by the Ministry of Finance in 
1993. In 1994, the minister of finance will attempt to 
accelerate the process through direct contact with his 
counterparts in the defaulting countries," Junior Finance 
Minister Ken Valley said in the Senate. 
  "These efforts are expected to culminate in 1994 with the 
full regularisation of the arrears." He named Antigua and 
Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines as countries not currently servicing all of 
their liabilities to Trinidad and Tobago. 
  "In some instances, no terms and conditions were determined 
for the repayment of the advances," he reported. "It is also the 
case in many instances that the countries defaulted several 
years ago. At this point, therefore, it has become necessary to 
verify the outstanding balances before the full recovery can be 
negotiated." At the end of December last year, U.S.517 million 
dollars was due to Trinidad and Tobago by its Caricom partners. 
The money represents only the bilateral portion of Trinidad and 
Tobago's debt portfolio. The multilateral arrears under the 
collapsed Caricom multilateral clearing facility amounted to 
almost 33 million dollars at the end of last year. 
  Out of the indebted countries, only Belize and St. Kitts are 
fully current and to-date they have repaid principal sums of TT 
65,620 dollars and 1,555,914 dollars (one TT dollar = 17.5 U.S. 
cents) respectively on the original loan balances, the minister 
said. Antigua and Barbuda owed U.S.2.5 million dollars; Dominica 
1.3 million dollars; Grenada over 600,000 dollars; Jamaica 
97,000 dollars; St. Lucia 388,000 dollars; and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines 100,000 dollars. The Trinidad and Tobago 
Government was expected to sign, early this year, a bilateral 
agreement with the Government of Guyana, whose bilateral 
liability to the government here and the central bank was 
U.S.487 million dollars or 94 percent of the total debt. The 
Guyana debt was restructured in 1989 but subsequently fell into 
arrears. In August last year, a team of government officials 
from Trinidad met with Guyanese counterparts to negotiate a 
memorandum of understanding for the consolidation of the debt. A 
memorandum was signed by both governments and forms the basis of 
a bilateral agreement between both countries. 
  The agreement provides for the liquidation of the arrears of 
34.5 million dollars which was due from August 1990 to July 
1993. The agreement provides for a rescheduling of these arrears 
over a twelve-year period with a six-month moratorium on 
principal repayment. The 1993 agreement also provides for two 
semi-annual payments of 10.5 million dollars in 1994 and similar 
amounts in 1995 and 1996. 
  "Payments falling due under this agreement may be reduced by 
a range of debt conversion techniques including debt-equity 
swaps," said Valley. In pursuit of debt-equity swap 
opportunities, in March this year, the government is mounting an 
investment and trade mission to Guyana. The aim of the mission 
is to identify businesses in Guyana in which the participants, 
both from the private and state enterprises sectors, will be 
prepared to make equity investments." 
  With regard to the recovery of the amounts due to the 
Trinidad and Tobago Government and central bank by the 
government and Central Bank of Barbados, both governments last 
December signed a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum 
provides for the set-off of the government of Trinidad and 
Tobago's share of the liability of the cargo airline Caricargo 
to the Barbados National Bank against the debt of the Government 
of Barbados and the Central Bank of Barbados to Trinidad and 
Tobago. 
  Caricargo's debt to the Bank of Barbados is Bds59 million 
dollars (one Bds dollar = 50 U.S. cents) with Trinidad and 
Tobago's share being 29.5 million dollars. 
  The debt set-off will result in Barbados' U.S.25 million 
dollar liability being reduced by U.S.15.3 million dollars.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Nunes smiled approvingly as a clutch of agitated soldiers grasped their 
automatic rifles and bolted past the front porch of her small clapboard house 
near the Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) station where radical Muslim 
rebels were holding 29 hostages behind a barricade of booby-trapped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged government worker seemed unperturbed by the occasional bursts 
of small-arms fire just a block away. 
</P>
<P>
"Come in and wash your face and have a glass of rum," she called out in a 
traditional gesture of Trinidadian hospitality to a group of harried foreign 
journalists who had paused to take cover. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting placidly in her porch rocker with a half-emptied glass in her hand, 
Nunes said she would be happy if the soldiers stormed the station and the Red 
House Parliament building where 42 more members of the radical Jamaat al 
Muslimeen rebel group were holding Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson and 17 
other senior government officials captive. 
</P>
<P>
But even though she shared widespread feelings against the unpopular prime 
minister for austerity policies that have pinched the incomes of most 
Trinidadians, she hoped he would not be killed or forcibly ousted from power 
during the hostage ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the sonuvabitch either," she said, her rocker thumping 
emphatically on the porch floorboards. "But we'll vote him out our own way, not 
by hostage takin'. Don't be takin' the choice out of my hands!" 
</P>
<P>
Her implacably democratic feelings were shared by many in the devastated 
capital city, even among those who virtually wiped out Trinidadian commerce and 
industry with five days of rampant pillaging when law and order broke down on 
the first night of the hostage crisis. The rebel leader, Yasin abu Bakr, had 
counted on such disaffected people to join his aborted revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Why he did not succeed in turning the violent seizure of Parliament and the 
broadcast center into a full-scale revolution was clear as the waters of the 
Caribbean to the country's leading sociologist, Dr. Selwyn Ryan of the 
University of the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
"Trinidadians play cricket, and cricket is a game of rules that must be 
respected," he said as if that explained the matter. "People who play cricket 
don't make revolutions. It isn't cricket." 
</P>
<P>
As for the lawlessness and looting that left Port of Spain's once sparkling 
Independence Square commercial center looking as burned out as downtown West 
Beirut, the editor of a leading local newspaper had an equally benign and 
probably correct explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not complicated by racial hostilities or an uprising of the 
dispossessed or that sort of thing, because all races and classes appeared to 
take part," he said. "It was simply people taking something for nothing in the 
absence of visible law and order. That's not peculiar to Trinidadians." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Muslimeen rebels themselves, hardly anyone in Port of Spain 
thought the seizure of the hostages was a revolutionary act. Most of those 
interviewed on the streets agreed with Col. Joseph Theodore, the armed forces 
chief, when he called it a simple act of terrorism, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abu) Bakr expected the people to rise up like revolutionaries and help him," 
said a businessman who declined to give his name. "Instead they rose up and 
helped themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The wild carnival atmosphere of the looting during the first three days of the 
hostage crisis already has provided the material for legend. Lennox Murray, a 
local devotee of traditional Caribbean calypso music, said he knows several 
calypso composers and singers who are already at work immortalizing some of the 
Herculean looting feats they witnessed on the flame-lit streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it, Mon! ," Murray exulted. "Usually take six Trinidadians to move a 
refrigerator 10 feet. Now we see one man take a fridge six blocks on his head. 
What a song!" 
</P>
<P>
The question of why the looters burned down so many buildings, including some 
of the city's most modern office structures, remains a puzzle, but like 
everything else that happened here last week, there were many uninformed 
rumors. A cab driver named Joe Winter said he knew for a fact that Libyan arson 
squads had come ashore from ships to accompany the looters. 
</P>
<P>
Winter also claimed positive knowledge that a U.S. Navy task force lurking just 
offshore "blew them Libyan boats sky-high right out of the water." When 
challenged with the obvious fact that no warships were in sight, Winter blandly 
amended his report. "They were submarines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Winter's rumors were wholly fabricated, talk of a Libyan connection 
had a basis in fact. Abu Bakr is known to have visited Libya and received 
financial support from its radical leader Col. Moammar Kadafi, according to 
Trinidad and Tobago police who have had him under surveillance for six years. 
Some of his men received military training in Libya as well, the police said. 
But they said that they have found no evidence that Libya had anything to do 
with Abu Bakr's violent takeover of the Parliament and broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
Before founding the radical Muslim sect and turning to violence, Abu Bakr was a 
respected, law-and-order mounted policeman. For lack of a better explanation of 
Abu Bakr's recent behavior, The Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that he 
underwent an abrupt change of personality after being medically discharged from 
the police. The medical reason for the discharge, the newspaper said, was that 
Abu Bakr had become addled after his horse kicked him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the final outcome for Abu Bakr and his 111 fellow hostage takers, now 
in military custody and likely facing charges of treason and murder, they will 
not have a home to return to if their freedom ever is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings of the nine-acre religious commune that the sect built on squatter 
land north of Port of Spain burst mysteriously into flames two days after the 
crisis ended on Wednesday. No one seemed to know who started the fires, but 
they centered on the plush four-bedroom apartment of Abu Bakr in a building 
that contained the commune's shops. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fire, journalists were taken on an army-sponsored tour of the 
commune and found it totally, and apparently hurriedly, abandoned by the wives 
and children of the insurgents. Discarded clothing and other possessions of the 
radical Muslims littered the buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like Jonestown without the bodies," said Bernard Diederich of Time 
magazine, who covered the 1979 mass suicide in Guyana of the followers of the 
Rev. Jim Jones, another rebel who claimed a religious mission to purify a 
corrupt world.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 10 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago's attorney general Keith Sobion said Sunday 
government will not be pressured into making a decision on a 
land dispute with the Jamaat al Muslimeen. 
  Leader of the Muslimeen, Yasin Abu Bakr, who led the 1990 
coup attempt on a former government here, said Friday his 
organisation had suffered "injustices" at the hands of the state 
and would not sit idly by should the appeal court not deliver 
judgement on the land dispute. 
  In a statement following a strongly-worded warning by the 
commissioner of police, Sobion said government was committed to 
the rule of law, and fully respected the role and function of 
the judiciary. 
  "It will not be party to any attempt to subvert the rule of 
law or indeed to manipulate the judiciary. Moreover, the 
government is confident that the judiciary will not itself 
rebuff any attempt, whether by the government or otherwise, to 
subvert or manipulate its processes. Any suggestion to the 
contrary is patently groundless. The government itself will not 
be pressured into making any decision relating to this matter," 
he said. 
  Sobion noted that there were essentially two issues relating 
to the lands at Mucurapo Road, in the northern township of St. 
James. The first is about the status of persons living there, 
and [the other] is the liability of the state for the demolition 
of certain buildings shortly after the end of the six-day siege. 
  Following a press conference called by Bakr, Commissioner of 
Police Jules Bernard condemned the statements as threats, saying 
the police were ready to deal with anyone who threatened to 
disturb the peace.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem radicals freed an ailing
and wounded Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Tuesday, four
days after they took him and 40 other people hostage in a coup
attempt, the attorney general said.
   The other hostages, including 15 government officials, were
still held, Attorney General Anthony Smart said. He refused to say
what conditions led to the 63-year-old Robinson's release.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk confirmed
Robinson was freed and said, ``We hope the situation can be
resolved in a quick and peaceful manner.''
   But Smart told reporters, ``This crisis is far from over.''
   He said the government in this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million
residents was continuing efforts to win the release of the others
held by former policeman Abu Bakr and his band of Moslem extremists.
   ``These discussions are at a very delicate stage,'' with lives
at stake, he said.
   The hostages were seized Friday by extremists who captured the
Parliament building and the government TV station about one mile
away. At least nine people were yle.''
   Attorneys representing the families of Raymond Belknap and James
Vance claim those lines on the band's ``Stained Class'' album
contain the subliminal message ``do it'' that prompted the youths
to shoot themselves in a deserted church playground Dec. 23, 1985.
   Belknap, 18, died immediately. Vance, then 20, blew away most of
his face but lived three more years, undergoing several operations,
before he died on Thanksgiving Day 1988 of complications from his
injuries and the various medications he was taking.
   The band and CBS Records deny any hidden messages exist. They
counter that the supposed ``do it'' sounds are an exhalation of
breath, and a combination of drums, guitars and vocals.
   ``The sounds I hear are essentially my own exhalation of breath
at the end of the line I am singing,'' Halford testified.
   ``There are no subliminals of any nature'' either in the song or
on the album, he said.
   Halford testified that the song ``Better by You, Better than
Me,'' was the only song on the 1978 album that wasn't written by
band members.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Assailants shot into President
Noor Hassanali's limousine, but the president was not inside and his
wife narrowly escaped the attack unharmed, police said.
   Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson refused to speculate on a motive
for the attack but told Parliament Friday that ``all measures to
catch the perpetrators have been put in place, and I urge the public
to remain calm.''
   The attack occurred Thursday night when Hassanali's wife,
Zaylahar, 65, was returning home in the limousine. Police
Superintendent Sorzano Araetes said three men attacked 200 yards
from the couple's home on the outskirts of Port-of-Spain.
   ``A white Mazda vehicle pulled up alongside and shots were fired
into the presidential car, barely missing the president's wife,''
and other bullets hit the side of the limousine, Araetes said.
   The chauffeur also escaped injury, he said.
   Araetes said police found the attack car Friday, with AK-47 shell
casings inside.
   Hassanali, 68, a retired Supreme Court judge, became president in
1987 and has avoided controversy. The post of is ceremonial.
   Trinidad and Tobago, a two-island state of 1.2 million people in
the southern Caribbean off South America, gained independence from
Britain in 1962.

   Behind the sun, sand and carefree
islanders of the tourist brochures lies another Caribbean of
hardship and frustration that is a breeding ground for radicalism.
   It became visible when Moslem extremists tried to overthrow the
government of Trinidad.
   ``Trinidad was a ticking time bomb, but it is only one of a
number of such situations in the Caribbean,'' said Larry Birns,
director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington.
   Economic decay throughout the region provides fertile ground for
civil unrest, analysts say.
   ``Economic prosperity solves a broad range of societal problems,
and economic despair breeds them,'' Birns said.
   Abu Bakr, leader of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen, said he and his
followers seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and 54 other
hostages on July 27 because of the poverty that has replaced
Trinidad's oil bonanza of the 1970s.
   Most of the Caribbean's two dozen islands have similar problems
because of shrinking world markets for bauxite, oil, bananas, sugar
and other traditional exports.
   Unemployment in the region averages 22 percent, foreign debt in
the billions drains tax revenues, inflation erodes buying power and
living standards fall.
   Foreign investment, trade agreements like the Reagan
administration's Caribbean Basin Initiative and expansion of
tourism have not stopped the decline.
   ``Unfortunately, the United States thinks in terms of hundreds
of thousands of dollars to solve Caribbean problems when it's going
to take hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Birns, whose
organization often criticizes U.S. policy in the region.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam, demanded
Robinson's resignation and blamed him for the country's economic
plight. Most of Bakr's support came from poor blacks.
   Robinson won a landslide election victory in 1986, but Birns
said the prime minister had become a ``political pariah,'' largely
because of austerity measures dictated by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans.
   Consumer price increases, layoffs and reduced spending on
schools and hospitals demanded by the IMF have provoked riots in
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Guyana, as well as several
Latin American countries.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stepped into this picture,
analysts say, with handouts for Bakr and radical political parties
with potential to destabilize governments.
   ``It's a well-known fact that Libya has funded leftist
activities in Dominica, Antigua and St. Lucia and separatists
organizations in Martinique and Guadeloupe,'' said John Collins,
Caribbean advisor to the Puerto Rican government.
   ``The left-of-center parties in these small islands use support
from Gadhafi to exploit the economic underdevelopment which exists
in their countries to mount opposition to the right-of-center
parties that are pro-U.S.''
   The six-day hostage siege in Trinidad, which prompted widespread
looting and claimed at least 38 lives, has prompted Caribbean
leaders to review regional security measures.
   ``Our determination that this must not happen again must be
given explicit effect,'' Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of
Barbados said at last week's annual meeting of the 13-member
Caribbean Economic Community, or Caricom, in Kingston, Jamaica.
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica said a regional
security agreement dating to the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada
should be expanded to allow Caricom armies to intervene when an
elected government is threatened.
   In Trinidad's case, Caricom sent a multinational force of 150 on
Friday, two days after the siege ended, to aid the army and police.
   Guyana's independent Stabroek News said in an editorial that the
attempted coup was ``an affront to the aspiration of the region's
people.''
   ``We know the shock waves have reverberated throughout the
Caribbean, where many governments face a difficult economic
situation, and we imagine this will spur them all to greater and
more purposeful efforts to define a democratic future for Caribbean
peoples,'' it said.
   Anthony Maingot, a native of Trinidad who teaches sociology at
Florida International University in Miami, acknowledged the
region's vulnerability, but said democracy was firmly entrenced.
   ``This is the largest gathering of Third World democracies in
the world,'' Maingot said.
   He noted that in Trinidad Prime Minister Robinson ``is still
there, the elected government is still there and parliamentary
democracy is still intact. This is the silver lining of the cloud.''

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 12 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will issue new passports from the 
beginning of next month to combat passport fraud. 
  "In 1993 alone, over 300 cases of passport fraud came to our 
attention and for the first ten days of 1994, 18 cases have been 
reported, " Chief Immigration Officer Arthur Harper told 
reporters on Wednesday. 
  Harper said passports were being stolen to get the United 
States visas which were then inserted into a fradulent passport 
and sold to members of the public for as high as 10,000 Trinidad 
and Tobago dollars (one TT dollar - 17.5 US cents). 
  The Immigration chief said the passports which were being 
printed by a firm in the United Kingdom, had a number of 
built-in security features and were virtually tamper-proof. 
  Persons over 16 years old who have never owned a passport or 
whose passport has expired will have to pay 150 dollars while 
persons under 16 years would have to pay 75 dollars. 
  The holders of unexpired passports who are over 16 years 
will be required to pay 100 dollars for the new passport and 
persons under 16 years will pay 50 dollars. 
  Harper said all passports issued before Immigration started 
handing out the new ones will be declared null and void on June 
30, 1995.

Tobago's former national security minister, John Donaldson, has 
been appointed non-resident ambassador to Korea. 
  Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj said Donaldson will be 
based in Port of Spain, as economic constraints have forced 
government to increase the number of non-resident ambassadors 
where diplomatic postings in faraway countries were concerned. 
  "I'm optimistic that being able to be in closer contact with 
the cabinet and the government, a non-resident ambassador will 
be better positioned to deepen relations ... And will prove more 
productive than what existed before," he said. The minister also 
said that a delegation of Korean businessmen was expected in 
Trinidad for a trade fair in April.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Looters hauled away carloads of
television sets and other appliances while vigilante squads guarded
some homes Sunday during the chaos of an armed uprising by Moslem
extremists.
   Fires broke out in several parts of the capital, Port-of-Spain,
and a thick cloud of acrid smoke hung over the city.
   A government-imposed curfew took effect in mid-afternoon, and
the streets were deserted _ except for looters.
   ``Everybody is trying to secure themselves because people don't
know what's going to happen,'' said Trinidanian Ian Mckenzie, who
was watching looters on the outskirts of Port-of-Spain. ``We don't
want our country this way. We are a democratic country.''
   In middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods, residents banded
together to stave off attacks. Several homes in the Westmoorings
suburb, about six miles northwest of the capital, were ransacked,
and residents fenced off the area to keep intruders away.
   A witness said he said two men _ armed with 12-gauge shotguns
and a .38-caliber revolver _ trying to shoot open a large safe by
the side of a road.
   Widespread looting broke out along the Churchill-Roosevelt
highway, the main artery between the airport and the capital.
People pulled their cars up to warehouses and filled them with
refrigerators, televisions and radios.
   Supermarkets, pharmacies, clothing, hardware and appliance
stores were systematically stripped by convoys of vehicles. Looting
also spread outside the capital to the villages of Barataria, San
Juan, Mount Hope and El Socorro.
   Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah broadcast an appeal over
government-run radio for looters to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said.
   ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to take away items
like refrigerators, television sets and videos, that is not right.''
   Army and police patrolled downtown Port-of-Spain around the
Parliament building, known as Red House, where Prime Minister
Arthur Robinson was being held hostage by black Moslem rebels.
   But in many parts of the city, no police were visible. Some
people kept an eye out for police while friends looted stores.
   On Saturday, a witness in the Picadilly area of eastern
Port-of-Spain said about 50 policemen fired shots into the air to
stop the looters. But people ignored them and continued to plunder
stores.

<HEAD>Moslems Hold Government Hostages in Coup Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem extremists who stormed
into Parliament firing automatic weapons held the prime minister
and other officials hostage Saturday. Trinidad's archbishop said
the rebels had wired the captives with explosives.
   The rebels said they had overthrown the government in the attack
Friday afternoon, but Education Minister Clive Pantin said Saturday
that the government had not fallen and was in control of the
situation.
   The Red Cross said several people were wounded, and a news
report said three people were killed.
   After bursting into the Parliament building Friday afternoon,
the rebels from the Black Moslem group took Prime Minister Arthur
N. Robinson and members of his Cabinet hostage. Some captives were
apparently being held in the Parliament building called Red House
and others in a TV station.
   Archbishop Anthony Pantin said on government radio he talked to
coup leader Abu Bakr for 25 minutes Saturday afternoon. He said
Bakr told him the TV building was surrounded by men with guns and
he would detonate the captives and himself if an attack was
launched.
   ``He has informed me that the prime minister and other
parliamentarians in the Red House are wired up with explosives,''
Pantin said.
   Police superintendent Leonard Taylor imposed a curfew until 1
p.m. Sunday. Acting President Joseph Emmanuel Carter declared a
state of emergency Saturday morning and put the country's
5,000-member army and 1,500-member police on alert. Carter was
serving as president while President Noor Hassanali was in London.

TRINIDAD CRISIS PERSISTS AFTER TALKS COLLAPSE

<P>
An end to Trinidad's hostage crisis drew tantalizingly close Monday, but 
negotiations collapsed at the 11th hour as renewed gunfire was heard at the 
Parliament building, where the prime minister of this twin-island nation and 
about 45 other people are being held captive. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials had called an evening news conference to announce the 
imminent release of the hostages and freedom for their black Muslim captors, 
but as the conference began an embarrassed official declared: "We came here 
expecting to give you word of an agreement, but as of now we cannot." 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to square one," conceded Maj. Dave Williams, a spokesman for the 
Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
As Williams spoke, there was a prolonged burst of gunfire from the vicinity of 
Red House, the Parliament building where wounded Prime Minister A. N. R. 
Robinson has been held by rebellious Muslims since Friday evening. Also being 
held are Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and others. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some wire services reported that Robinson and the chief negotiator for 
the Muslim extremists said they had reached agreement to end the standoff. But 
Williams denied that an agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfight broke out after negotiations already had become snagged over a 
demand by rebels in Red House to take their loaded weapons with them into 
officially approved sanctuary at their nine-acre religious enclave in Mucurapo, 
north of Port of Spain, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
In a confused series of announcements, government spokesmen Monday first 
estimated the number of hostages at up to 100, then scaled the number back to 
60 to 80, and finally, late Monday, issued what they called a "firm figure" of 
41. 
</P>
<P>
The government's chief information officer, Gregory Shaw, said there are 25 
hostages in the television building and 16 at Red House. The Red House hostages 
number eight government ministers, including Robinson, six other members of 
Parliament, the former ambassador to London and a top civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
As for hostage takers, Williams said they are believed to number about 45 in 
Red House and 75 in the television complex, where a prolonged gun battle 
involving rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and automatic weapons erupted at 
mid-morning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The morning clash occurred when some of the hostage takers attempted to shoot 
their way out of the television annex building and were driven back inside by 
troops who have surrounded both hostage sites, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no explanation of the renewed gunfire around Red House, which occurred 
shortly before the beginning of a 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew Monday night. But the 
occurrence of two armed clashes at a time when the government felt it was 
making progress in negotiations for the release of the hostages suggested a 
pessimistic outlook, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it remained uncertain whether negotiations with the rebels, which began 
Saturday, were still in progress Monday night. Government spokesman Shaw, said 
only that "up to this time (7 p.m. Monday local time), the government has not 
agreed to demands of the group that have been holding the prime minister and 
his colleagues and other persons at gunpoint since they burst into Parliament 
Friday evening." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw stressed several times that "intensive efforts are continuing to ensure 
the safety" of the hostages. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that Knolly Clarke, an Anglican clergyman who talked to Robinson 
by telephone Monday, reported that the prime minister told him he would be the 
last to leave Red House, only after all the other hostages were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also said Robinson had been shot in both feet but was reported in 
stable condition and under treatment by Dr. Emmanuel Hosein, the health 
minister and a fellow hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Although some pillaging of stores and shopping centers continued Monday, Port 
of Spain and its environs appeared calm. Officials clamped a 24-hour curfew on 
the capital's center, where the hostage sites are located, and a 6 p.m.-to-noon 
curfew on the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts from the one radio station still operating stressed that "security 
personnel have shoot-on-sight instructions" for dealing with looters, who 
already have plundered an estimated $50 million worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of casualties remained uncertain, but a local newspaper, the 
Express, said city hospitals reported 314 persons treated for injuries. A total 
of 169 required surgery, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams minimized casualties in the Defense Force, saying only that three 
soldiers had been hit, none seriously, by gunfire. He said he believed six of 
the hostage takers, all members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen black Muslim group, 
had been killed. Unofficial estimates of the number dead in Port of Spain ran 
as high as 100. 
</P>
<P>
The black Muslim group, long a focus of concern to the government because of 
what it perceived as the organization's tendency toward violence, is itself 
showing signs of schism, Shaw and Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams cited the attempted breakout at the television complex at a time when 
the Red House hostage takers appeared to be in agreement with the government as 
evidence of what he called "some degree of splintering in the ranks of the 
hostage takers." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Red House group appeared to have broken ranks with the television 
group when they began demanding the right to keep their arms -- the demand that 
caused the hoped-for agreement to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, as outlined by the government spokesman, the television 
complex and Red House captors would be granted amnesty and be allowed to return 
in stages to their Islamic religious commune, itself a source of longstanding 
conflict with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the first step would be release of the television hostages, who 
would be taken to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden for physical and 
psychiatric examination. Their captors would then be freed to return unarmed to 
their commune. Next, the hostages in Red House would be released in the same 
fashion and their captors freed to go back to the Muslim enclave in Mucurapo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the failed agreement included any conditions requiring the resignation 
of Robinson and appointment of an interim government including Muslim leader 
Yasin abu Bakr, the spokesmen said they were "not aware of any such condition 
being on the table." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a clear account of events from the government or local news 
outlets, rumors abounded. Among them was a report that a battalion of troops 
from the Jamaica Defense Force had been flown in from Kingston to assist local 
forces in policing the capital, as well as a rumor that some American troops 
had landed. 
</P>
<P>
Both were denied by Col. Ralph Brown, commander of the Trinidad and Tobago 
Defense Force. "We've got things under control, and we don't need any help," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, Bakr, has been the center of controversy since 1985, when he 
founded the black Muslim group on the premise that "the nation was corrupt in 
the hands of evil men," said the Express newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Following a stint in jail for contempt of court, Bakr went to Libya and formed 
close ties to that country's radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi. Following his 
return to the islands, Bakr was arrested after a police raid uncovered an arms 
cache at the Muslim commune. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy flared again last year when the government charged that his 
group was occupying the commune illegally and sent a crew to demolish some 
buildings there. Last week, just three days before he led the hostage-taking 
raid on the television complex and Parliament building, Bakr lost a high-court 
test to claim rights to the land. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House and State Department spokesmen both emphasized that 
the estimated 6,000 American citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, most of them 
tourists, appeared to be in no immediate danger. However, the U.S. Embassy 
issued an advisory suggesting that Americans on the island remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Violence in the country appears to be restricted to the capital, White House 
Deputy Press Secretary Steve Hart noted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to comment on reports that American naval vessels were in the 
vicinity of the islands, although the Navy routinely keeps several ships in a 
large naval training area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials noted the ties between Libya and the group holding the 
hostages, but added that no evidence exists of Libyan involvement in the 
current attack. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer David Lauter, in Washington, contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 Muslims make the Caribbean their home. But most are East Indians 
who disdain the radical politics of black Muslims such as those holding 
Trinidad's government hostage. Many East Indians consider black Muslims to be 
political opportunists, inspired more by the black power movement than by 
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of the 1960s in 
the United States, was born in Trinidad. Prominent Muslims among the region's 
political leaders include President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime 
Minister Hamilton Green of Guyana. The first Muslims came to the region to work 
in the sugar cane fields in the 1700s. Now, domed mosques can be found on a 
dozen Caribbean islands.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Houston couple who decided to
celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign
vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned.
   ``I feel like I've been a hostage here,'' grumbled Melvin Hazel
on Monday.
   ``We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at
me,'' said his wife, Darlene, confiding: ``I have a lot of sense of
adventure.''
   They're among some two dozen Americans still stranded on this
Caribbean island where Moslem extremists stormed Parliament and the
state television building on Friday, seizing the prime minister and
other officials.
   Some of the Americans have since left the island on one of a few
packed flights by regional carriers. But most have been unable to
leave.
   ``Doesn't the American government have any responsibility for
us? They've shown no intention of helping us,'' said Nancy Schnair,
here with husband Howard Schnair of Chicago on a planned combined
business-vacation trip.
   Lucy Hall, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, said American visitors to
the island were being contacted and assured their government was
concerned about them.
   ``We can't help them because we don't run any airlines,'' Ms.
Hall said of American requests for help getting off Trinidad. She
said some 2,100 U.S. citizens, the great majority of them
residents, are on the islands.
   ``I just want to be somewhere else,'' said Chris Bigalkie, here
on business as regional vice president of Drew Industrial Division.
``We don't have anything like this in Memphis (Tenn., his
hometown).''
   The Schnairs, another couple on a combined business-pleasure
trip _ Martin and Joyce Beckwith of Boston _ and the Hazels of
Houston spent much of Monday morning sitting on the airy veranda of
the Hilton Hotel overlooking this capital city.
   They heard the volleys of gunfire and explosions and saw fire
erupt from the state television complex, where rebels were holding
hostages.
   Hazel, who works in construction, said he and his wife, with
three children in their 20s, wanted to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in style. They had once met some Trinidadians who sang
the praises of their island, and they thought this would be the
perfect place for a long-delayed second honeymoon.
   They arrived Thursday and spent Friday sightseeing. But when
their taxi driver returned Friday evening to take them to dinner at
a seafood restaurant as they requested, he advised them not to go
downtown because of the violence.
   They scrubbed plans to visit sister island Tobago, and now are
only anxious to go home.
   ``They really messed it up for us,'' said Mrs. Hazel.

<F P=106> [Article by Ria Taitt] </F>
  [Text]Nation Security Minister Russell Huggins has 
estimated the annual value of the illegal drug trade at "well 
over one billion dollars." 
  Huggins was speaking at a news conference in the Parliament 
Committee Room yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of 
the Senate. The media conference was called to answer 
journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  Huggins said the proposed amendments would allow Trinidad 
and 
Tobago to ratify the Vienna Convention. This, he added, would 
give this country greater access to funding for the fight 
against the drug trade from donor countries such as the United 
States, the Netherlands, Germany and France. 
  He said the passage of this legislation signals to the 
international community that "we are serious." 
  Huggins said one of the more important features of the Bill 
was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said, 
could destroy the financial system of a country. 
  "One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash. 
So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by 
buying a boat from someone for $90,000. You pay in cash and then 
you sell it back for $80,000. You are prepared to take the 
$10,000 loss because you now have $80,000 certified (clean) 
money." 
  He cited the U.S. as an example of a case where there has 
been a proliferation of jewelry stores and "when you go down 
inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply 
being used as fronts." 
  He said that in Trinidad and Tobago drug lords had used the 
importation of potatoes as a laundering device. 
  He said laundering could occur in any establishment: "Where 
you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing 
it. 
  You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them 
for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another 
way is to buy up postal orders every month." 
  Huggins said one of the biggest busts in the U.S., "US $6 
billion in cash," had been organised in this way. "A massive 
laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all 
the resources they have. 
  I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't 
look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit 
together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit." 
  But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on 
it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation. 
"Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you 
into his trust overnight," he said. 
  "He said between November 1993 and this year, the Trinidad 
and Tobago authorities had participated in the seizure of 200 
kilos of cocaine shipped from Trinidad. The intelligence given 
for its seizure came from here," he said. 
  Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had 
to deal with money-laundering, Huggins pointed to some of the 
shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did 
not go far enough. 
  Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a 
drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an 
offence for someone to help him. 
  Huggins said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing 
this, would also limit the number of places where the 
drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed 
for the recognition and enforcement. 
  The Bill was passed unanimously at 9:45 p.m.

   The Americas:
   Trinidad Fiasco Spotlights Libya's Terror Network

   When the 112 AK-47-toting members of the Jamaat al
Muslimeen, or People of Islam, seized the Parliament of
Trinidad and Tobago along with the prime minister and 40
other hostages -- allegedly to rid Trinidad of a corrupt and
unpopular government -- news accounts portrayed it as an act
of terrorism by a fringe Moslem fundamentalist group.
Subsequent reports revealed that the group received training
in Libya and that Yasin Abu Bakr, the group's leader,
acknowledged traveling to Libya and called Col. Moammar
Gadhafi "our friend." The U.S. State Department, though
critical of Libya's involvement, says no apparent direct link
exists between the terrorists and Libya.
   That is surprising. A 1986 State Department report charged
that "Libya has also actively recruited members of . . .
leftist leaders from Antigua, Barbados, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the French
Departments {who are} invited to Libya for seminars at which
they are urged to undertake violent action rather than
peacefully participate in the political process." The report
concluded that "Libyan activities should be a matter of
serious concern for the entire hemisphere." Since then,
Libyan involvement in the Caribbean has continued if not
increased. Moreover, it appears Col. Gadhafi has enlisted
terrorist groups from the Middle East and Europe with close
ties to Libya.

   In April 1987, Venezuela expelled a Libyan diplomat "for
allegedly being involved in activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status" -- a euphemism for spying or terrorism.
The "diplomat," Abdul Salim Ashur, was later arrested. In his
possession authorities found evidence of a "huge terrorist
operation directed against the Lesser Antilles": read
Trinidad. The Arab Press Service reported that Mr. Ashur's
plans called for Libya's financing and arming of radical
groups in French Guiana, Suriname, Haiti, Jamaica and, yes,
Trinidad and Tobago (as well as other Caribbean islands).
   Throughout the region, Libya has set up "People's Bureaus"
and Islamic schools and centers that act as front
organizations to conceal Libya's active recruitment and
financing of regional subversives. Since 1986, delegates from
leftist Caribbean organizations have attended the
"International Center for Combating Imperialism" conference
held every year in Tripoli. Through these instruments, Libya
has succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with a
well-trained cadre of terrorists.
   Two months ago, 15 pro-Libyan terrorists were indicted in
Costa Rica for various terrorist acts, including three
bombings of U.S. offices in Costa Rica between 1986 and 1988.
The group, the Santamaria Patriotic Organization, was formed
in 1986 following the U.S. bombing of Libya in April. One of
the terrorists, Domingo Solis Solis, was reported to have
joined the El Salvadoran communist FMLN guerrillas in their
military offensive last November.
   Middle Eastern radicals operate in South America as well.
In May 1987, Venezuelan authorities arrested Mahmoud Abed
Atta, reportedly a senior agent of terrorist Abu Nidal, and
had him deported. Another man with reported Abu Nidal links,
Hussein Bouzildi was arrested by Peruvian authorities two
months after the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement bombed a
U.S. Information Service Center to mark the anniversary of
the April 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli.
   Besides Tupac Amaru, other Latin American radical groups
receive Libyan support, including Ecuador's Alfaro Lives,
Carajo], Colombia's 19th of April Movement and Chile's
Movement of the Revolutionary Left. All have sent guerrillas
to training camps in Libya and received financial support
from Col. Gadhafi.
   Perhaps the most disturbing terrorist event in the
hemisphere with possible Libyan connections is the bombing by
the Medellin cocaine cartel of a Colombian Avianca plane last
November in which 107 people were killed. Though no evidence
directly implicates Libya, major aspects of the case suggest
an indirect role.
   Interpol informed Colombian authorities that guerrillas of
the Basque separatist group, ETA, carried out the bombing for
the Medellin cartel. The subsequent investigation revealed
the guerrillas used Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made explosive
that cannot be detected by airport security checkpoints. The
ETA receives financial support from Libya and many of its
members go there for training. Moreover, Czechoslovakia's
President Vaclav Havel disclosed in March that the previous
communist government sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex. Quoting
from government sources, the Bogota-based newspaper El
Tiempo, reported that "the same detonator was used to blow up
the Pan Am plane on a flight from Britain to the United
States in December 1988." Libya has been directly linked to
that bombing as well.
   The coup attempt in Trinidad is the tip of the iceberg.
The social dislocation and resentment accompanying economic
restructuring have weakened already fragile Caribbean
democracies and simultaneously created an unstable political
environment susceptible to exploitation by radical groups. We
should expect more terrorism traced backed to Libya.

<HEAD>Alleged Arms Supplier For Trinidad Revolt Arrested Here</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most of the arsenal used in a failed coup attempt
in Trinidad by Moslem extremists was purchased at gun shows and
shops throughout South Florida, says a complaint against the
alleged chief supplier.
   Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach was arrested early Thursday during
a raid on his home, said federal agents.
   The federal complaint against Haneef also includes a warrant for
the leader of the revolt, Yasin Abu Bakr, a former Trinidad
policeman who took the island nation's prime minister prisoner for
six days in July before surrendering.
   Of the 135 weapons confiscated in Trinidad after the revolt
collapsed, 105 were traced to purchases made in Florida by Haneef,
said Joe Vince, assistant special agent in charge of the Miami
office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``He was supplying the weapons that were used in the
insurrection - there is no question about it,'' the agent said.
   The arrest shows the United States will not tolerate gun
smuggling, said Miami's U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``We are no longer going to allow South Florida to be used as a
Mecca for people to purchase weapons to be used for narcotics
traffickers ... or people planning rebellions anywhere in the
Caribbean or in the Americas,'' Lehtinen said.
   Haneef bought at least 200 assault rifles and other firearms and
the ATF is seeking the missing guns, said Vince. He also purchased
250,000 rounds of ammunition, along with electronic equipment that
included hand-held radios.
   One key question was where Haneef obtained the approximately
$100,000 in $100 bills he used to buy the weapons in Dade and
Broward county gun shows and weapons shops, Vince said.
   Trinidad officials said Bakr and many of his men had visited
Libya and received training and money there, although they have
found no evidence Moammar Gadhafi was behind the coup attempt.
   Haneef's money was drawn on a bank in the Persian Gulf nation of
Bahrain, but its original source was still part of the
investigation, he said.
   The federal complaint, along with Haneef and Bakr, names Billaal
Abdullah, another leader of the revolt, and Riad Ali, both of whom
are also imprisoned in Trinidad.
   Haneef was originally from St. Louis, and changed his name from
Louis Cole when he became a Moslem, Vince said. He added that the
complaint would eventually be presented to a grand jury for
indictments.
   The men are accused of gun control and arms export violations,
said Vince.
   The investigation began in October 1989 when a Miami police
officer became suspicious of large gun purchases Haneef made at a
weapons show, according to an affidavit by ATF agent Thomas Bailey.
   Haneef was interviewed and said the weapons were for a gun club,
but the agency began surveillance. He ultimately bought about 200
weapons, including AK-47 and Ruger Mini-14 assault rifles,
shotguns, M-1 carbines and large-caliber pistols.
   The weapons and ammunition were allegedly smuggled out of the
United States in April aboard a freighter, hidden in hollowed-out
wall boards, Vince said. He said investigators had obtained a
warrant in hopes of placing an electronic tracer on the shipment,
but it had left port before they got there.
   The rebellion in Trinidad broke out in July when Bakr's forces
seized the Parliament House and state television, holding hostages
including Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and other government
leaders.
   They demanded Robinson's resignation, new elections and amnesty,
but eventually surrendered on the sixth day of the crisis. Bakr and
other revolt leaders are now in jail facing treason, murder and
other charges.
   Vince said he did not expect Bakr to be extradited to Miami, but
said the warrants would remain in force in any case.

<F P=106> [Article by Wesley Gibbings: "Dollar Laundering Law Coming, </F>
Says Huggins"] 
  [Text] Government is considering the introduction of 
banking regulations which will make deposit declarations for 
large sums of money mandatory. 
  National Security Minister Russel Huggins made the 
revelation 
yesterday, saying the measure would be one instrument in the 
campaign against money laundering. 
  The matter arose while Huggins steered a motion on the 
granting of diplomatic immunity to the Caribbean Financial 
Action Task Force through the Senate. 
  Huggins was responding to a query from Opposition Senator 
Wade Mark who said commercial banks should not be left on their 
own to monitor a situation that provided vital clues to the 
scale of money laundering activities in the country. 
  "Don't leave it up to commercial banks," Mark said. "One 
important area of money laundering is the commercial banking 
sector." 
  Mark described the current arrangement as a "gentleman's 
agreement." Bankers have however reported some success with the 
system and a number of depositors, according to banking sources, 
have reportedly been turned away as a result. Huggins said 
regulations would be taken to Parliament on the matter "soon." 
  He also defended the country's invitation to the Task Force 
to set up office here, saying it offered a range of resources to 
enable this country to battle money laundering more effectively. 
  He told Senators that the body was not a policing agency and 
that it was established to offer technical advice and expertise 
to counter the incidence of money laundering in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. 
  Independent Senator Martin Daly expressed scepticism about 
the institution and said a trial period of two years should be 
built into the motion granting it diplomatic immunities and 
privileges. He however refused to pursue the amendment when the 
vote was taken. 
  Huggins also addressed fears by Mark that the industrial 
relations climate of certain regional institutions left much to 
be desired. 
  The Opposition Senator contended that the managers of some 
institutions often hid under the cover of diplomatic immunity in 
order to commit serious breaches of the constitutional rights of 
workers. 
  Huggins however said the terms of such diplomatic 
arrangements were dictated by international conventions and 
practices. The motion was passed unanimously. Last Friday, it 
gained similar consent from the Lower House.
