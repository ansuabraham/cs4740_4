days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:

with a radio network of 24 stations.
   In 1939, 50 years ago, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone
of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C.
   In 1940, the first 75,000 men were called to armed forces duty
under peacetime conscription.
   In 1948, William Lyon Mackenzie King retired as prime minister
of Canada after 21 years. He was suceeded by Louis St. Laurent.

capsule _ carrying astronauts James A. Lovell and Edwin ``Buzz''
Aldrin Jr. _ splashed down in the Atlantic.
   In 1969, 250,000 protesters staged a peaceful demonstration in
Washington against the Vietnam War.
   In 1978, 183 people were killed when a chartered Icelandic
Airlines DC-8 crashed short of an airport in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
   In 1980, Pope John Paul II began a five-day visit to West
Germany, becoming the first pontiff in 198 years to visit the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation.
   In 1982, funeral services were held in Moscow's Red Square for
the late Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   In 1985, Britain and Ireland signed an accord giving Dublin an
official consultative role in governing the troubled British-ruled
province of Northern Ireland.
   In 1987, 28 of 82 people aboard a Continental Airlines DC-9,
including the pilot and co-pilot, were killed when the plane
crashed on takeoff from Denver's Stapleton International Airport.
   Ten years ago: The British government publicly identified Sir
Anthony Blunt, a respected art historian, as the ``fourth man'' of
a Soviet spy ring that included Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Kim
Philby.
   Five years ago: Baby Fae, the month-old infant who had received
a baboon's heart to replace her own congenitally deformed one, died
at a California medical center almost three weeks after the
transplant.
   One year ago: The Palestine National Council, the legislative
body of the PLO, proclaimed the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state at the close of a four-day conference in Algiers.

Baker Jr. is 64. Actor Edward Asner is 60. Singer Petula Clark is
57. Actress Joanna Barnes is 55. Actor Sam Waterston is 49.
   Thought for Today: ``He too serves a certain purpose who only
stands and cheers.'' _ Henry Brooks Adams, American historian
(1838-1918).

CLIMB PIKES PEAK FOR FAMOUS VIEW OF A STUNNING AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By T. R. REID, WASHINGTON POST

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt you know that it bears the best-known name of any mountain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What you probably don't know, unless you've made the spectacular, winding trip 
to the top, is that the snow-capped massif called Pikes Peak also offers the 
most famous vista to be seen from any American mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Looking eastward from the summit of Pikes Peak, 14,110 feet above sea level, 
you see an endless expanse of spacious skies stretching over amber waves of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
When you turn around and gaze west, you see purple mountain majesties above the 
fruited plain. And as you look over this scenic splendor, you know for certain 
that you have found America the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
If those descriptive phrases sound familiar, they should. For it was here on 
the summit of Pikes Peak, in the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies just 20 
miles west of Colorado Springs, that a Wellesley College professor named 
Katharine Lee Bates was moved to write the poem that has become the national 
anthem of our nation's physical grandeur: "America the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed about America since the July day in 1893 when Bates traveled 
to the summit and was instantly inspired to create her moving hymn. Happily, 
though, the view from atop Pikes Peak has not changed much at all. 
</P>
<P>
All the wonders that sent Bates scrambling for pen and paper are still here to 
see. The rolling waves of grain fields to the east still glisten a deep amber 
beneath a mid-summer sun. And the imposing mountain majesties off to the west 
-- ridge after ridge of snowcapped ranges -- really do look purple against the 
dark blue Rocky Mountain sky. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if you're searching for a travel destination that will prove -- either to 
yourself or to your kids -- that this country is still America the beautiful, 
you can't go wrong by planning a trip to southern Colorado and a trek to the 
top of Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
There were three ways to get to the top of the Peak when Bates made the trip: 
by foot, by train and by carriage. The same three ways are available today, 
except that the horse-drawn carriage that took Bates and her party up the Pikes 
Peak Highway has been replaced by the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you choose to hike, the trip today is quick and relatively easy. A round 
trip on the Cog Railway that chugs up the mountain's east face takes three 
hours and 10 minutes, including a little less than an hour at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Driving the steep, winding 20-mile highway takes about an hour each way. Which 
means you will probably spend just half a day visiting America's most famous 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it hadn't been lucky enough to be given a memorably alliterative name, 
Pikes Peak would almost certainly have become a famous natural feature. This is 
a simple fact of geography. 
</P>
<P>
Pikes Peak is the easternmost of the "fourteeners" -- the elite category of 
American mountains reaching higher than 14,000 feet. As such, it was the first 
to be "discovered" when the white man began exploring the mountain west nearly 
two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Army lieutenant, Zebulon Montgomery Pike, was dispatched in 1806 to head 
an exploratory troop mapping the lower reaches of the Louisiana Purchase -- 
sort of a southern version of the Lewis and Clark expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Arkansas River west from the Mississippi, Pike and his men spent 
week after redundant week traversing the empty flatlands of the high plains. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Nov. 16, 1806, on an eastern Colorado meadow about 120 miles from the 
present city of Colorado Springs, Pike looked up to the west and saw "a small 
blue cloud." 
</P>
<P>
As they came closer, the soldiers gradually realized that this spot on the sky 
was really a massive, snow-draped mountain. Thanks to the prerogatives of rank, 
the peak was eventually named for the commanding officer of the troop that 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
That enormous mountain marks an abrupt shift in the topography of the 
continent. Here the flat, featureless meadowland of middle America gives way to 
the wrinkled spine of Rocky Mountains that make up the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
And the change occurs with dramatic suddenness. With just a few low foothills 
before it, Pikes Peak juts up abruptly from the plains to scratch the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the nation's easternmost alp quickly became a powerful symbol of 
the rugged West -- "the most celebrated peak in America," as the Forest Service 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
When the gold seekers of 1859 set out from Kansas City, their wagons were 
emblazoned with the famous slogan, "Pikes Peak or Bust." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, railroad interests created a resort city, Colorado Springs, at the 
base of the mountain to help draw tourists. Hiking trails, the cog railroad and 
a narrow carriage road were constructed on the mountain to carry visitors to 
the peak of the Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was only natural when Katharine Lee Bates arrived in the Springs to 
teach a summer school course at Colorado College -- one of her faculty 
colleagues that summer of '93 was a political scientist from Princeton named 
Woodrow Wilson -- that she should set aside a day to travel to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
When she alighted from her carriage at the top, Bates wrote later, she stood 
still for "an ecstatic moment" drinking in "the most glorious scenery I ever 
beheld." 
</P>
<P>
"As I was looking out over the sealike expanse of fertile country spreading 
away so far under those ample skies," Bates recalled afterward, "the opening 
lines of the hymn floated into my mind . . . Oh beautiful for spacious skies, 
for amber waves of grain. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Katharine Lee Bates (1859-1929) is well remembered in the environs of 
Pikes Peak. If you stop to visit the campus of Colorado College, a lovely green 
oasis near the heart of downtown Colorado Springs, you can see a mural honoring 
her poem in the school's Shove Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
And in the small gift shop/rest house at the top of the mountain, there's an 
author's holograph of "America the Beautiful" in Bates's own hand. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling from the West to Pikes Peak, you'll probably stop in Denver 
and then drive the 70 miles to Colorado Springs. If the sky is clear -- a rare 
occurrence in Denver these days -- you'll see the Peak poking its snowy face 
skyward due south of Denver airport as your plane comes in to land. 
</P>
<P>
Driving south along Interstate 25, you'll begin to get marvelous vistas of the 
majestic mountain about 20 miles out of Denver. For my money, the view from the 
north is the most dramatic way to see Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
The great white mountain (it is snow-covered about 42 weeks of the year) 
hunkers there on the horizon like a great white whale, its long ridge rising 
gradually to the sharp peak. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of Colorado Springs, I-25 skirts the campus of the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, nestled in against the jagged hills of the Rampart Range on the 
eastern slope of the Rockies. There's a well-marked overlook here that offers a 
stunning view of the eastern face of the Peak, the face that Zebulon Pike first 
saw from his vantage point out on the plains. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach Colorado Springs, it's a 10-minute drive westward on Route 24 to 
the little tourist town of Manitou Springs, where most of the routes up Pikes 
Peak begin. 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid hikers might choose to trek to the top on the Barr Trail, a 
well-marked but extremely demanding hiking route laid out by Fred Barr from 
1914 to 1918. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Forest Service, thousands of people start the trip every year 
and a few hundred finish it. It's roughly 12 miles of hiking -- no technical 
climbing required -- with some incredibly steep sections and scores of 
switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people turn back early, because the first four miles are quite tough, 
and down there below timberline there's not much view of the peak. Those hikers 
who make it all the way generally plan on a two-day round trip, with a stopover 
at Barr Camp, four miles and 4,000 feet below the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regular hikers are the members of Colorado Springs' Ad-Am-An (i.e., 
"add a man") Club. This fraternal organization adds one member each year. The 
neophyte must pass initiation by climbing to the top on New Year's Eve, when 
the club sets off an annual fireworks display that can be seen for 50 miles in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Manitou Springs is the boarding point for the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, an 
electric train with two bright red cars that follow a surprisingly straight 
track to the top. Round-trip fare is $17 for adults, $8 for people between 5 
and 11 years old; preschoolers ride free. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular means of ascent these days is the Pikes Peak Highway, a 
serpentine 20-mile toll road that is paved for the first seven miles and then 
becomes reasonably smooth gravel. This is a steep and occasionally terrifying 
driving experience, but most two-wheel-drive family cars can make it. It's open 
from May to October each year. 
</P>
<P>
At the toll gate, you'll be charged $14 for a family of four. The rangers there 
offer driving tips: Don't use your air conditioning; it will make hard-working 
engines overheat. Stop now and then on the way down to let your brakes cool 
off. 
</P>
<P>
To enforce that last rule, there is frequently a policeman stationed about five 
miles below the summit to feel each car's wheels and warn motorists whose 
brakes are overheated. The best time to go is in the morning, because the 
summit can be hazy or completely fogged in on summer afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The drive up Pikes Peak is one of the loveliest auto trips you can imagine, 
particularly above timberline (11,500 feet in Colorado), where the views seem 
to spread out forever and the mountainside becomes a vast white sea of snow. 
</P>
<P>
And then you reach the summit, bundle up against the nippy summer breeze, throw 
snowballs until your hands freeze solid and soak in the 360-degree splendor of 
the mountain view that you've been singing about since your school days. 
</P>
<P>
America! America! From this unequaled vantage point at the very roof of the 
Rockies, it is clear that God really has shed His grace on thee. 
</P>

Visitors Bureau at (800) 888-4748, Ext. 20 or 22.

<LEADPARA>  THIS turn-of-the-century Rocky Mountain town offers tourists easy access to an
extraordinary collection of natural wonders -- red rock formations, caverns,
mountains and mineral springs.;    Centuries ago, Ute, Arapahoe, Cheyenne and
other American Indian tribes considered the area sacred. Here, they laid down
their weapons and abandoned thoughts of war for religious ceremonies and
meditation -- and to drink and bathe in the waters flowing from the area's
dozen mineral springs.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DRINK UP! THE SPRINGS FLOW FREE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Destination: Colorado  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The town was founded during the late 1800s, when Victorian-era tourists
were partial to "taking the waters." The enterprising Army Gen. William J.
Palmer, founder of neighboring Colorado Springs, developed the region as a
health resort and spa.;    Manitou Springs has attracted a brisk tourist
business ever since.;    There are still 10 freely flowing mineral springs
within the town's borders -- each with its unique taste, particular mineral
content and attributed healing properties. Individual springs, it is said,
cure everything from arthritis to rheumatism, from dyspepsia to constipation.;
   The waters are free. Just go up to the tap with a cup or jug and fill 'er
up.;    Better yet, arrange with the local Chamber of Commerce for a free
one-hour tasting tour of the springs. While you stroll the quaint streets and
drink of the waters at Cheyenne, Twin, Wheeler, Soda and other springs, the
guide will regale you with local history and colorful anecdotes about the
town's founders and early residents.;    Be sure to visit Soda Spring, flowing
from a calcium-encrusted fountain in the center of the lobby of the town's spa
building at 934 Manitou Ave. The water is clear, cold and pleasantly bubbly,
with sodium, potassium, calcium and lithium among its contents.;    The
Spanish-style stucco spa, built as the Manitou Bath House at the turn of the
century, is now a hotel, where guests may spend the night and bathe in Soda
Spring's waters. The cost is $35 per night for two people, including
breakfast.;    Move over source Perrier!;    Ute Chief Spring, at 1311 Manitou
Ave., spews from the hands of a statue of an Indian chief. Cheyenne Spring is
in a red stone spring house, now being restored, at 934 Manitou Ave. Twin
Spring, with its tap outside a shop at 121 Ruxton Ave., is the preferred water
for lemonade.;    Of the natural wonders surrounding Manitou Springs, the most
famous is Pike's Peak, rising 14,110 feet on the eastern horizon.;    Although
this ranks only as the 32nd highest summit in Colorado, the ascent is
staggeringly steep. In 1808, explorer Zebulon Pike declared the peak
unclimbable. In 1820, Edwin James, set foot on the summit and proved him
wrong.;    Relatively few tourists managed to struggle up the mountain until
Zalmon Simmons, of Simmons mattress fame, built a railway to the summit. The
Manitou &amp; Pikes Peak Railway was completed in October 1890.;    West of town
is the Garden of the Gods, a splendid outcropping of gigantic red rock
formations. Manitou means "Great Spirit," and Native Americans believed this
place was created and inhabited by gods. Garden of the Gods Trading Post,
established 100 years ago, still sells authentic American Indian crafts.; If
you go . . .; (check) GETTING THERE -- Manitou Springs is a pleasant 70-mile
drive from Denver. From Stapleton International Airport, take Quebec Street to
Interstate 70, head east to I-225 then south to I-25 and continue south to the
Manitou Springs exit at U.S. 24. For car rentals, Dollar Rent-A-Car currently
has the best rates.;    (check)  WHERE TO STAY -- Manitou Springs has a
variety of excellent accommodations, ranging from the Soda Springs Spa (719)
685-1505) to the exclusive Broadmoor Hotel (800) 634-7711) and the intimate
Two Sisters Inn Bed and Breakfast (719) 685-9684).;    (check) INFORMATION --
Call Manitou Chamber of Commerce (800-642-2567) for information about the
springs. For attractions surrounding the town, call the Colorado Springs
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, (719) 635-7506.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Dropping Water Table Means Long-term Changes in Plains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was part of what explorer Zebulon Pike in
1806 called the Great American Desert, the High Plains where grass
was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide.
   Pike's adventures along the Arkansas River to the Rocky
Mountains gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of
low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural
barrier that would limit U.S. westward expansion.
   Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and
crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th
meridian. Dryland farming, the settlers found, was a precarious
business in the Great American Desert.
   It began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground
water supplies for large-scale irrigation. A huge, invisible lake _
the Ogallala Aquifer _ was a gold mine for parts of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska.
   But for years the underground water level has been receding,
forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs. Already
irrigation has become uneconomical for many.
   ``In order to maintain a viable agricultural economy, this area
must return to a dryland type of production,'' says Agriculture
Department economist Wendell Holmes in the current issue of
Farmline magazine. ``How soon the transition will be made depends
somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation
practices.''
   Holmes said ``it seems reasonable to assume'' that some
irrigation will continue for a number of years. New technologies
and more drought-tolerant plants may help for a time.
   ``Whatever the time, though, adjustments must be made in order
to be ready when the wells run dry,'' he said.
   Holmes and a colleague, Mindy Petrulis, in the department's
Economic Research Service studied an area of the high plains in
West Texas, which included seven irrigated counties and eight
neighboring dryland counties.
   The irrigated counties included Castro, Crosby, Floyd, Hale,
Lamb, Parmer and Swisher, while the dryland counties were Baylor,
Cottle, Foard, Haskell, King, Knox, Stonewall and Throckmorton.
   Holmes said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in
the 1940s and 1950s as irrigation became widespread. A move to
``center pivot'' systems made it possible to nearly triple yields
of cotton, wheat and corn on land previously farmed without
irrigation.
   By 1960, the Texas high plains had become one of the most
irrigation-dependent areas of the United States.
   But the nearby dryland counties, which lie just to the east of
the Ogallala Aquifer, have never had enough water from surface or
below-ground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation.
Holmes said that has been apparent from their economic performance
beginning in the 1940s.
   ``The economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate
and periodically worsen, because of the lack of water for crops,''
Holmes said. ``One effect has been a continued heavy outmigration
of rural people.''
   For example, between 1940 and 1984, the total population of the
dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a
fourth.
   In contrast, Holmes said, the irrigated counties experienced
rapid economic growth and development during most of the 1940-84
period. Despite a small decline in the last few decades, total
population in the mid-1980s exceeded 100,000 people, a 38 percent
increase from 1940, and employment at about 41,000 was up nearly 80
percent.
   Meanwhile, in the dryland counties that weren't blessed with an
abundance of water, farms grew larger and fewer in order to
maintain their incomes, and population dropped by 32 percent from
1940 to 1959.
   ``Dryland farming does not require a large labor force, nor can
it support a large rural or urban population,'' Holmes said.
``Thus, there was little inducement for people to move into the
area or, having been born there, to stay. More and more people
found employment elsewhere.''
   But by 1960, the fast-track development of the irrigated
counties slowed down. From 1959 to 1978, he said, the value of farm
products sold increased about 60 percent, compared with a tenfold
increase in the previous 19 years.
   And by 1978, almost 2,400 irrigation farmers had gone out of
business and 140,000 acres of cropland had been taken out of
irrigation. Rising costs of energy took a toll.
   The tough times continued among dryland farmers, too. Population
in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from 1959 to 1978,
total employment was down more than a tenth, and 31 percent of the
farm operators went out of business, Holmes said.
   In the 1980s, the financial situation for farmers across the
nation deepened as debt piled up, land values declined and interest
rates edged higher.
   Between 1978 and 1984, the total value of farm products sold
dropped 4 percent in the irrigated counties, while they increased
about 10 percent in the dryland area.
   Holmes said the population of the irrigated counties in 1978-84
declined about 3 percent, and total employment decreased for the
first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   The trends were much different in the dryland counties. Farm
income rose 22 percent, compared with an 18 percent decline in the
irrigated counties.
   Holmes said that was because the proportion of total farm sales
from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from 1978 to 1984 because
of government price support programs. And dryland farm operations
cost much less.
   In fact, he said, per capita income in the dryland counties in
1984 was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties.
Unfortunately, the long decades of decline in the dryland counties
had resulted in a grim bottoming out.
   ``So many people have left that the economy has finally
stabilized, and most of those who remain are those with the jobs
that are still available,'' Holmes said.

<HEAD>With BC-Heartland Gambling</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   This town, population 945, will try for a
riverboat gambling license. So will Dubuque, with more than 60 times
as many people.
   ``I think there's a possibility of us getting a license, but I
think it's an uphill battle,'' said McGregor Chamber of Commerce
official Charlie Zahn. ``Personally speaking, I think it stinks.''
   The northeast Iowa communities, about 60 miles apart on the
Mississippi River, are two of the Iowa towns that plan to apply for
licenses from the state Racing and Gaming Commission following
approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week.
   There is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued,
but observers expect no more than three _ some say only one _ will
be issued for the first year.
   On paper, Dubuque would appear to have an overwhelming edge. The
city boasts many tourism attractions, highlighted by Mississippi
River boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel
license when gambling was legalized in Iowa four years ago.
   But McGregor officials concede nothing.
   Their own attractions include a 970-acre park named for Zebulon
Pike, a series of 191 preserved prehistoric Indian burial grounds,
and thousands of acres for hunting and camping. Officials felt
confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a
contractor to build a boat dock for about $500,000.
   McGregor is a half-mile stretch of restaurants, antique shops,
taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking
the river.
   ``Being a smaller community, I think it's only fair that we
should have an opportunity like this, rather than everything going
to the big urban areas,'' said McGregor City Clerk Norm Lincoln.
   Dubuque has a different argument for the gaming commission.
   ``There is a point that's reached where there's too many people
in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing. I
think a full-fledged operation like we plan in Dubuque and a
full-bore operation very close to us, such as McGregor, might be a
little bit much,'' said Don Hess, a spokesman for the Dubuque Racing
Association, the non-profit group seeking a license.
   Hess, also director of marketing and communications at Dubuque
Greyhound Park, said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring
Wisconsin, potentially cutting attendance and revenue in Iowa.
   ``We're hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a
floating casino out on the Mississippi so we can have two major
tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people
that we'll be losing to Wisconsin.''
   A floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra $100 million a
year to the local economy, Hess said.
   In McGregor, officials feel the state almost owes them a license
to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town
purchased by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   ``McGregor's never going to land the big industry, and the
economics are such that we'll probably never see a dog track or
horse track,'' Mayor Robyn Denning said. ``We just never seem to get
our fair share of what's going on.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When it comes to stamps, millions of citizens
seem to have ideas about what should go on them. Pressure and
controversy can get pretty intense (as in behalf of the Elvis
Presley stamp). That's why the committee that decides meets behind
closed doors and never explains its reasoning for picking one
subject over another.

   They are America's headstones, its family
albums.
   Stamps.
   It used to be the U.S. Postal Service would put George Washington
(282 times) or Ben Franklin (133) on its postage and hope they would
stick.
   But in the 2,500-plus stamps since the first Washington-Franklins
of 1847, postage has become more than just glued paper. Today's
stamps are colorful as rainbows, varied as flea markets and one of
the most exclusive portrait galleries in the world.
   Every year some 25-30,000 native sons, bypassed heroes, worthy
causes, deserving luminaries, memorable landscapes and happy
birthdays are proposed for a stamp. Only 25 or 30 make it.
   Once upon a time Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a collector, would
call up Postmaster General Jim Farley with an idea and tell him to
get printing. Today, in the course of human events, a committee
decides.
   Who, how, what, when, where?
   ``It's about as democratic a process as we have going,'' says
Dickey Rustin, manager for stamp information at the Postal Service.
   The deciders, appointed by the postal commissioners for the last
30 years, are the 13 members of the Citizens Stamp Advisory
Committee. They meet here six times a year to decide, by majority
vote, whom you will be sticking your tongue out at on the way to the
post office.
   The decisions tend to be upbeat. Wyatt Earp stands a better
chance of being postally canonized than Billy the Kid. (Jesse James
was proposed and turned down. So was a pretzel with beer-flavored
glue). It helps to be good looking. We've had cardinals and bald
eagles and poinsettias. No turkey buzzards.
   Beyond the certitude that there will always be a stamp in
circulation showing the American flag (54 times) it is difficult to
make book on who will make the postal hall of fame.
   Consider:
   We have had Abraham Lincoln but not Jefferson Davis; Babe Ruth
but not Roger Maris; Lewis and Clark but not Zebulon Pike; Crazy
Horse but not George Armstrong Custer; Canada but not Japanese
cherry trees; paddy wagons but not Bonnie and Clyde; Mary Cassatt
but not Jackson Pollack; John Harvard but not Elihu Yale; Jack
London but not Irving Berlin; jack in the pulpit but not skunk
cabbage; a Frank Lloyd Wright house but not an outhouse (proposed
and flushed); Nobelists Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner and John
Steinbeck but not Nobelist Ernest Hemingway; Duke Ellington but not
King Louis Armstrong; Hoover, Herbert but not Hoover, J. Edgar;
Feeding the Hungry but not fat farms.
   Conversely, or perversely, we have had population control and
baby carriages, Mexican independence and the Battle of San Jacinto.
   One might surmise that Custer and Jeff Davis are in limbo because
they lost, Hemingway because he took his own life, Maris because of
his asterisk. You'll never know because the committee doesn't
publicly explain its reasoning.
   When John Harvard was stamped in 1986 to celebrate his namesake
university's 350th birthday, that opened the door for Yalies and
loyal sons and daughters of Leland Stanford, Sophia Smith, Johns
Hopkins, Lord Jeffrey Amherst and Col. Ephraim Williams, et al., to
demand equal billing. To cool hot potatoes, the post office will not
henceforth immortalize college founders.
   Better news for others. Satchmo may make it because the post
office issues a stamp every year honoring the nation's black
heritage. The outhouse probably won't because, as Rustin says,
stamps are ``the nation's calling cards.'' Irving Berlin probably
will get there, but he's not dead yet. You have to be entombed for
at least 10 years to qualify unless you're a president. They're
eligible one year after their first posthumous birthday.
   ``We believe someone has to stand the test of time,'' Rustin
explains.
   Love has apparently met that standard. The annual ``love'' stamp
sells _S.W.A.K. _ a smashing one billion per issue.
   The advisory committee is, as are the stamps they select, a cross
section. Three are historians. One publishes a graphic arts
magazine. An executive of General Motors is a stamp collector.
Digger Phelps, a collector and Notre Dame basketball coach, is a
member. So is Belmont Fairies, former editor of the canceled
Washington Star, TV executive Jack Rosenthal and Dr. Douglas Lewis,
director of sculpture at the National Art Gallery.
   When the committee meets, Rustin and his staff present the
proposals that have flooded in over the transom from a stamp-minded
citizenry. Each has had a modicum of research. Some proposals are
obvious. Columbus stumbled upon the New World 500 years ago in 1992.
World War II for U.S. involvement will be 50 years old starting in
1991. D-day seems a likely choice. Japanese bombers over Pearl
Harbor don't.
   ``We get into some things controversial,'' says Rustin, ``but we
don't want to reflect badly on the U.S. We don't build a fire that's
not going to warm us.''
   There was a 1981 stamp, for instance, that said ``Alcoholism@You
Can Beat It.'' Would the recipient think there was a hidden message
beyond the one in the envelope?
   The committee's closed door discussions can get heated over
social concerns or a nominee's worthiness. Some proposals have
waited 40 years in the bullpen before making it to stampdom. If the
committee remains undecided, it may ask Rustin for further research.
   Some proposals are accompanied by petitions. ``We neither
encourage nor discourage them,'' says Rustin. The commission allows
no lobbying before it and doesn't credit any proposal.
   ``We don't want to get into who was first.''

   Lear in Iowa: Family Farm, Family Trouble

   Jane Smiley's latest novel, "A Thousand Acres" (Knopf, 352
pages, $23), is set in Zebulon County, Iowa, where the
farmland is "thicker, richer, more alive with a past and
future than any soil anywhere." The land is also layered with
long-festering intrigues among jealous neighbors, and poisons
blamed for miscarriages and cancer. This is the novel's
overriding metaphor -- a rich but deceptive topsoil yielding
up secrets of the buried past.
   Initially, the story's calm, inviting surface recalls Joan
Chase's lyrical portrait of a family farm in "During the
Reign of the Queen of Persia," as well as Ms. Smiley's own
previous works of fiction, with their almost uncannily
precise depictions of daily life. In her widely praised books
"The Age of Grief" and "The Greenlanders," Ms. Smiley made
the very ordinariness of things the most compelling substance
of her narratives. But "A Thousand Acres" turns out to be
closer in spirit to her ambitious recent novella, "Good
Will," in which seemingly innocent beginnings lead to dark
revelations and unexpected violence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The novel, set in the late 1970s, is narrated by Ginny,
whose father, Larry Cook, owns the biggest and most
profitable farm around -- a thousand acres. Ginny is an
accommodating, even malleable, sort, although at 36 she has
been bitterly disappointed by a series of miscarriages with
her husband, Ty. She's appealingly levelheaded, but not
immune to deeper impulses; she confesses to harboring vague
desires, "secret, passionate wishes."
   While the youngest sister, Caroline, went to college and
became a tough-talking lawyer in Des Moines, Ginny and her
sister Rose stayed behind on the farm. It is soon apparent
why. After their mother died, when they were teenagers, their
father became an abusive tyrant who kept the entire family
under his thumb. Later, Rose will force Ginny to remember
just how abusive "Daddy" was; as time goes on, that word
comes to have chilling, Sylvia Plath-like overtones.
   When the father suddenly decides to cede the farm to his
three daughters, it brings the hidden past to the surface and
winds up setting each family member against the other,
irrevocably. Another catalyst is Jess Clark, a neighbor's
prodigal son, back from Canada, where he had been since
Vietnam. For a while, he's the answer to Ginny's "passionate
wishes" -- and he convinces her that the farm's runoff in the
groundwater is to blame for her miscarriages.
   Ms. Smiley can describe compounding strains in a marriage
better than anybody, and the confrontations between Ginny and
Ty -- quiet but devastating -- are among the best scenes in
the book. She's superb at depicting the surface effects of
feelings "too complicated . . . to name," the way trust can
"disappear into formality," and she plays off this life of
the emotions beautifully against the daily necessities of the
farm.
   Wonderfully evoked, too, are the pressures of keeping up
appearances in a small town. Ultimately, Ginny concludes,
putting the best face on things in front of the neighbors is
the "broken plank you are left with after the ship has gone
down." Still, as the sisters confront their old father and
his tainted bequest, the unending string of disasters that
follows seems more than strictly necessary, while the
characters' motivations sometimes hover on the outer edges of
plausibility.
   It's pretty clear early on to the reader, for example,
that the erratic old farmer is in the initial stages of
Alzheimer's disease, but Caroline never seems to figure it
out. This is overly convenient, since it's essential to the
story that she blame the rest of the family for everything
that happens. As for Ginny, our sympathetic companion, the
ever-present litany of her household chores ("I spent the
morning shampooing the carpet . . .") will eventually include
preparing a jar of poisoned sausage. We've come a long way
from the stewed pork chops and kitchen-table confidences that
open this book.
   Still, the novel's center holds firm. Its narrative
momentum is undeniable, as is the psychological truth (with
its deliberate nod to "Lear") underlying the mortal combat
between Larry Cook and his daughters, and among the newly
estranged sisters. Indeed, if the grim patriarch dominates
the first half of the book, Rose -- grabby and manipulative
and iron-willed -- dominates the second. Of all the other
illusions of past and future, Ginny's adoring love for Rose,
her conviction that they were a team "united" against their
father, proves the most traumatic to give up. It is a point
of no return, but also exhilarating:
   "The strongest feeling was that now I knew them all,"
Ginny says of her divided family. "Rather than feeling `not
myself,' I felt intensely, newly, more myself than ever
before." It is the beginning of a new life, far from the old
"ordered, hard-working world."
   As for the thousand-acre farm in Zebulon County, one
notices right away that Ms. Smiley's novel begins in 1979 --
on the brink of the Midwestern farm crisis, with its falling
land values and rising suicide rates. The timing is an apt
and melancholy touch -- as though Larry Cook foresaw it all,
and wanted no part of it.

   Milo L. Pike said he has applied to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to increase his stake in Home Owners Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association's common stock to 24.9% from 9.9%. 
Mr. Pike said the Bank Board has informed him that consideration of the application has been delayed pending receipt of additional information. 

   Even if the application is approved, additional purchases by Mr. Pike may be subject to limits under Home Owners' charter. 
Any additional purchases would be for investment purposes, Mr. Pike said in a statement. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Home Owners fell 12.5 cents to $11.875. 

   As previously reported in a page-one story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pike, a New Hampshire investor, has been a key player in an ongoing tug of war between Home Owners shareholders and short-sellers, whose activity has driven the stock down in recent months. 

   Burlington, Mass.-based Home Owners couldn't be reached for comment on Mr. Pike's announcement, which was made after the market closed yesterday.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Observer: Pike landed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday Francis Pike dropped in for a board meeting of Drayton Far
Eastern Trust, before heading to Chelsea register office to wed Lady Annabel
Goldsmith's daughter, India-Jane Birley. Pike's new boss, Philip Tose,
chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank Peregrine Securities, flew in
for the day to be best man.
Without further ado, Pike left for Bombay, where he has 10 weeks before
opening the doors of a joint venture between Peregrine and Indian tobacco
company ITC.
Pike had spent the last 14 years at fund managers Invesco, 24 per cent of
which is now held by Peregrine. When management upheavals at Invesco a year
ago made his position uncomfortable, Pike, who has spent much of his time in
the Far East, took a call from his old friend Tose.
Having created Hong Kong's largest independent merchant banking group in
under five years, Tose's ambitions now stretch to repeating the success
story throughout Asia.
With the help of close associate Li Ka-Shing, lack of capital is not one of
Tose's problems. Peregrine last year sunk Dollars 30m into South Korea in
another joint venture, with commodities giant Dongbang.
ITC, meanwhile, rejected several British merchant banks in favour of the
Asian partner for its foray into financial services.
An adaptable sort, 39-year-old Pike spent his first three months in Tokyo
living in a Zen Buddhist temple before getting stuck into what he calls the
'gaijin ghetto'. But he is far from unworldly, as his blue Ferrari, fondly
remembered by Japanese friends, demonstrated.
In taking on the still formidable difficulties of the Indian market, he will
not be stuck for more ways to make his mark.

<HEAD>Racial Slur Triggers Ouster Of Veteran Houston City Councilman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political unknown defeated veteran City
Councilman Jim Westmoreland, whose racial slur involving the late
U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland triggered protest.
   For an at-large seat on the 15-member council, Ms. Clark
attracted 142,026 votes, or 55 percent, to 116,244 or 45 percent for
Westmoreland.
   Westmoreland said on Oct. 18 that Houston Intercontinental
Airport should be called ``Nigger International'' to appease council
members pushing to rename the airport after Leland, the black
congressman killed in an Aug. 7 plane crash while aiding famine
victims in Ethiopia.
   Last week, council members approved a resolution censuring
Westmoreland for the comment.
   Ms. Clark, 34, is a minority recruiter for the University
Outreach Program, a partnership involving the University of Houston,
Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas. The tutoring
program helps Houston middle school and high school students
interested in attending college.

   Cooper, 37, the Essex County business administrator, got 11,587
votes on Tuesday vs. 1,064 for Republican Kyle Mann and 312 for
independent candidate Christine Keno. Mann had unofficially
withdrawn his candidacy in September but his name remained on the

   Mayor Ruth Chandler said she had no intention
of discriminating when she called white voters and invited them to
City Hall for an after-hours voter registration session.
   Tuesday's scheduled mayoral election was postponed after the
Justice Department launched an investigation of the meeting where
only white voters registered.
   The mayor and other Zebulon officials agreed to the postponement
and a series of steps, including reopening the voter registration
rolls, to assure that blacks are not subjected to discrimination. No
new date for the election has been set.
   Mrs. Chandler's black opponent, Lewis E. Mack Jr., 31, said he
thinks the registration session, which occurred Oct. 20, was an
effort to get out the white vote against him.
   The 42-year-old Mrs. Chandler, who is white, is seeking her
second term. She defeated Mack for the $50-a-month mayor's job in a
race decided by about 50 votes two years ago.

   Anthony ``Capt. Tony'' Tarracino, the boat

mayor.
   The 73-year-old Tarracino defeated a former mayor, Tom Sawyer, by
32 votes _ 3,049 votes to 3,017 _ as he finally won Tuesday in his
sixth try for the office. In a campaign aimed at longtime residents,
Tarracino promised to slow development and gentrification of the
island city.
   He promised to be a goodwill ambassador for Key West who will
generate national publicity, but he warned that tourists may face
increased taxes as he tries to keep down Key West's cost of living.
   Tarracino recently sold ``Capt. Tony's'' saloon, but maintains an

   Election workers had only
themselves for company in this rural community in northwestern New
Jersey as all eight registered voters sent in absentee ballots.
   State law requires every municipality to provide a polling place
to ensure everybody has a right to vote, so for 13 hours on Tuesday
the township's one polling spot stood vacant, except for the three
people sharing shifts, including Mayor Donald Von Hagen.
   Most of the township was bought up in the 1960s by the federal
government for its Tocks Island dam project. The project was never
finished and now most of the Warren County community is part of the
Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Worthington State
Forest.
   Up for vote were two positions on the three-seat township
committee. No names were on the ballot and the 25-resident township
must wait until the absentee ballots are counted before they see who
the write-in winners are.

<HEAD>State Takes Control of Debt-Ridden Pike County Schools' Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state took control of Kentucky's
third-largest school district's finances Wednesday, citing a budget
deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as $3.3
million.
   The action by the State Board of Education means state
Superintendent John Brock's written approval will be needed for all
hiring and purchases by the Pike County district, which has 15,250
students in 30 schools.
   The board acted after two consultants it sent into the
mountainous eastern Kentucky district reported dozens of management
problems.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   ``I think the (state board) would have to take some
extraordinary action at this time. ... I think they need some
help,'' Brock said.
   He said the state veto over local hiring would relieve the local
board of some political pressure to dole out school jobs _ pressure
that has increased as layoffs increase in the coal industry,
according to the report by consultants Arnold Oaken and James
Melton.
   Brock also said it ``would remove that temptation'' for school
board candidates to promise jobs for votes. Three of the board's
five members are up for re-election in November.
   The chief reason for the state board's action, however, was Pike
County's third straight year of running a deficit budget.
   On paper, it has been cut from $3.3 million to about $300,000,
but that is illusory, Melton and Oaken told the board.
   The district soon will have to borrow $600,000 to keep
operating, increasing the debt to near $1 million again, and the
purchase of new school buses can be delayed no longer, they said.
   The local board has voted to close one elementary school, but
the report by Oaken and Melton said five should be closed, with 780
pupils redistributed. In the past, when the county has built new
schools, it has declined to close old ones, Melton said.
   It was not immediately known how long the state would manage
Pike County schools' finances under the seldom-used statute it
invoked. The action is less severe than a declaration of ``academic
bankruptcy,'' by which the state would take over actual management
of the school system.
   Brock said he would place a lieutenant in Pike County to oversee
the school system's finances. Brock said he had a former school
superintendent, whom he would not identify, in mind for the job.
   In Pikeville, school board Chairman Alvin Newsome said he
welcomed the state takeover, and 18-year board veteran Gifford
Varney said he hoped the action marked a turning point for the
district. But two other members said they believed the takeover had
been unnecessary.
   If Pike County voters were unhappy with board members, they
could elect someone else to do the job, said board member Carl
Biliter. He said the state action surprised him, but added, ``We
don't have no say over it because we were in debt.''

   While a nearly all-male club is
making its annual New Year's Eve trek up 14,110-foot Pike's Peak, a
group of women will be making a 1,000-foot ascent of a nearby
mountain in jest of the traditional event.
   This year's climb will mark the 66th annual climb of Pike's Peak
by the AdAmAn club, which plans to set off fireworks at the summit.
The group adds a climber each year.
   AdaWoman, a band founded in 1982, will make an ascent on Pyramid
Mountain in Ute Pass west of Colorado Springs, light sparklers, play
Helen Reddy's song ``I Am Woman,'' down champagne and head home for
the night, organizers said.
   It will be the seventh climb for the AdaWoman club, which was
founded almost as a lark by Rita Randolph and several other woman
who train on Pyramid Mountain.
   ``It's really beautiful up there, and one morning we had run the
mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new
year together,'' she said.
   The women also were prodded that year because AdAmAn, for the
first time in its history, was inviting a female guest, veteran
climber Sue Graham.
   ``One of the AdAmAn members said that the reason they hadn't done
it before was they didn't know any women who could make it,'' said
Randolph. ``Well, I and another of our members ran the Pikes Peak
Marathon, so I think we can make it.''
   AdAmAn historian Jim Bates said Graham, still the only woman
invited, will make her fourth climb with the club this year.
   ``Of course, when we started this climb in 1922, you couldn't
have hired a woman to go with us. It wasn't until a few years ago
that women got so they were into this type of thing,'' he said.
   Randolph said AdaWoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years, if one is
found worthy.

   City Council showed a little belated Christmas
spirit when it agreed to tear up 800 parking tickets issued Monday
to many car owners who thought it was a holiday.
   City Councilman Joe Giarrusso argued Thursday for giving auto
owners the benefit of the doubt. City Attorney Okla Jones countered
that the Streets Department had done nothing it wasn't authorized to
do.
   Several people cited for expired parking meters downtown and in
the tourist-loaded French Quarter said they thought the day after
Christmas was a ticket-free holiday.
   Jones said that Monday was a city government holiday not a public
holiday, which would have been ticket free.
   Streets director Betty Jo Everett said she gets tired of
defending the city holiday policy to irate drivers.
   ``We didn't gear up and lick our chops and think that we really
had something to go for,'' Everett said. ``It was just a normal

<HEAD>Titan Missile Launched, Probably Carries Military Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said Air
Force Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
Vandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.
   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.
2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.

AMERICA'S HEROES: MARBLE AND BRONZE

<P>
Each year, 1.5 million visitors view the bronze and marble statues that stand 
throughout the Capitol waiting to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Some are well-known. Many are not. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1864, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by Congress for a place in the National Statuary Hall -- America's 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said Barbara Wolanin, 46, curator of Statuary 
Hall since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
California's statues, both dedicated on March 1, 1930, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father Junipero Serra, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine California missions before he died in 1784. Father Serra's 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Starr King is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to California in 1860 from Boston to serve as 
pastor of the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout California championing the Union cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept California in the union," 
curator Wolanin said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in California only four years before dying at age 40 in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
Damien (Hawaii), who devoted his life to lepers on Molokai; Father Kino 
(Ariz.), a Jesuit missionary, and Brigham Young (Utah), the Mormon Church 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, Utah became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky Philo T. Farnsworth (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows Farnsworth holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Ridgecrest Elementary School in Butler, Utah, under the guidance of 
Principal Bruce Barnson, led the effort to put the Farnsworth statue in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored Farnsworth over 20 
other Utahans, including Eliza Snow, a poet and wife of Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church leader Ezra Taft Benson; hotelier J. Willard Marriott, and heavyweight 
boxing champion Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for Utah Gov. Norman Bangerter's unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, Elma (Pem) Farnsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: George Washington (Va.), Andrew Jackson 
(Tenn.) and James A. Garfield (Ohio). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of U.S. 
senators, 23 of House members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: Dr. Florence 
Sabin (Colo.), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized Colorado's 
public health system; Frances Willard (Ill.), founder of the Women's Christian 
Temperance Union; Marie Sanford (Minn.), educator and champion of women's 
rights; Jeannette Rankin (Mont.), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
Joseph (Wash.), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and Esther Hobart Morris (Wyo.), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (Hawaii), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- Charley Russell (Mont.). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and Will Rogers, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with Rogers' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on Congress to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will Rogers has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the Confederacy, 
Jefferson Davis (Miss.) and Alexander Hamilton Stephens (Ga.), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" John Gorrie (Fla.), and steamboat inventor 
Robert Fulton (Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (Ky.), Huey 
Long (La.), William Jennings Bryan (Neb.), Daniel Webster (N.H.), Robert E. Lee 
(Va.), Samuel Adams (Mass.), Roger Williams (R.I.), John C. Calhoun (S.C.), Sam 
Houston and Stephen Austin (Tex.), and Ethan Allen (Vt.). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lesser known include Jabez Curry (Ala.), Uriah Rose (Ark.), Edmund 
K. Smith (Fla.), George Shoup (Ida.), Samuel Kirkwood (Iowa), George Glick 
(Kan.), Zachariah Chandler (Mich.), Zebulon Vance (N.C.) and Jason Lee (Ore.). 
Most visitors to Statuary Hall have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide Madeline Allen said. 
</P>

Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in 1807, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the House of Representatives until 1857, when the House moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed a bill in 1864 to create the National Statuary Hall to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In 1870, Rhode Island contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
Nathaniel Greene. By the turn of the century, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By 1933, there were 65 statues crowded into Statuary Hall, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called National Statuary Hall.

   Firefighters mopped up a series of forest and
brush fires Sunday, but the danger of more blazes remained high
through a third straight day of record high temperatures and gusty
wind.
   Since Friday, six fires have broken out in the region from Pikes
Peak west of Colorado Springs to Boulder County northwest of
Denver. They were reported contained or near containment Sunday,
and had caused no injuries or structural damage.
   ``People haven't caught up with how tinder-dry things are,''
said Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the U.S. Forest
Service's Pike and San Isabel forest districts.
   Denver warmed to a record high again Sunday at 82 degrees. The
National Weather Service said the heat, coupled with strong
southwesterly wind and low humidity, made fire danger across the
state high to extreme.
   A blaze scorched about 20 acres just southwest of Denver, and
officials said visitors to nearby Mount Falcon State Park had been
asked to leave.
   An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the blaze, said
Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the Pike National
Forest.
   Authorities said one fire _ a 600-acre brush fire in Denver that
was put out Saturday _ may have been caused by arson. The other
fires may have been caused by humans unintentionally, they said.
   The largest blaze, an 872-acre forest fire west of Monument,
broke out Friday and was 100 percent contained Sunday, Knight said.
   ``There is not even a wisp of smoke coming up now,'' he said.
   Some firefighters from that blaze were released to fight a
150-acre fire near Deckers. That fire began Saturday afternoon and
was 60 percent contained Sunday, forest service officials said.
   Smaller fires were reported in Mueller State Park, about 45
miles west of Colorado Springs, and in Boulder County's Left Hand
Canyon.

TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the US cable television group that owns
CNN, is forming a joint venture in Russia to seek what it claims will be the
first independent television station in Moscow.
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by TBS and the Moscow
Independent Broadcasting Company, (MIBC), a private Russian company.
Mr Sidney Pike, president of CNN International's special projects division,
is in Moscow to represent Turner interests in the 50-50 project, which will
be broadcast free over the air. Revenues will come from advertising.
Mr Pike said yesterday the plan depended on obtaining local government
approval for a broadcasting licence to use Channel 6, an existing VHF
frequency. Russian authorities have indicated they plan to award the licence
within the next four months, Mr Pike added.
Under an interim licence MIBC and Turner have been broadcasting two hours of
CNN International, translated into Russian, every day on Channel 6 since
May. Mr Pike said the joint venture channel would include CNN news, classic
films, sport, entertainment and children's programmes, broadcast mostly in
Russian.
Channel 6 is the last VHF frequency available in Moscow. A formal contest
will be held to decide who should be given the licence. Siemens, the German
engineering group, and Russian partners are jointly developing plans to
equip nuclear reactors in the former Soviet bloc with western monitoring
technology for added safety, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The aim is to improve the safety of 1,000-megawatt VVER pressurised water
reactors, the most modern reactors produced in the former Soviet Union. The
technology would be based on existing Russian systems and advances under way
in Russia and be enriched with Siemens knowhow.

   At a Manhattan church this Sunday, that
commemorated Christmas pair, Mary and Joseph, will be portrayed in a
modern mode _ a homeless couple hunting for shelter.
   This has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people
across America today, just as it was the plight of Mary and Joseph
2,000 years ago in Bethlehem.
   ``They also were homeless,'' says the Rev. Thomas F. Pike of
Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church whose annual candlelight
service is presenting their situation as current rather than past.
   They, like many nowadays, ``had no place to stay,'' adds Pike,
who also heads the board of New York City's interfaith Partnership
for the Homeless. ``That family also was wandering the streets.
   ``They had to deliver the child in a backyard stable, a cave.
Then they faced persecution and had to flee. They had to leave for
another country. They were refugees.''
   In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless
Americans is a ``crisis not just in the lives of individual victims,
but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation.''
   As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest
private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and
some permanent housing, Pike added in an interview:
   ``The growing callousness and willingness of people to live
side-by_side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the
erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person.
   ``We see more and more tolerance of violence, a depreciation of
life. Our nation is really at a crossroads. If we don't resolve the
issue of homelessness, every cherished institution in American life
will be affected by cynicism and doubt.''
   Estimates have placed the number of U.S. homeless at up to 3
million, wandering the streets and byways of cities across the
country, crowding soup lines, hunting temporary shelter by night.
   Pike said President-Elect Bush's expressed hopes for a ``gentler,
quieter'' nation aren't likely ``if he doesn't listen to the cries
in the streets of the homeless.
   ``There's no way American society can be deaf and blind to this
crisis. Most people are hoping Bush provides leadership in dealing
with it.''
   Pike said that while the spreading severity of the problem may
represent the ``dark side'' of the picture, the massive volunteer
response to it represents the ``brighter side.''
   ``An incredible number of institutions are working on this
crisis,'' he said. ``Millions of volunteers of religious,
educational and philanthropic institutions are involved. It's a real
sign of hope.
   ``Literally every community and town on the face of this nation,
through individuals and groups, has mobilized support for hungry and
homeless people. If the President builds on that, we can have hope
that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated.''
   Pike, who estimates New York City's homeless at about 50,000,
said the inter-organizational partnership here has become a ``model
for places all over the country. Hundreds of them have picked it
up.''
   He said the ``the key to it is partnership,'' not only among
religious congregations, Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish, but
also with civic, labor and other organizations as well as city and
state agencies.
   ``We present a united response, cooperative and not
confrontational, that maximizes communication in dealing with the
system,'' he said.
   Pike, 51, who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for
diocesan bishop _in Los Angeles and New York _ said that 400 New
York City churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and
shelter to the homeless.
   The congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2,000 people
per night _totalling 400,000 last winter with more than a million
meals served. About 24,000 volunteers have served in the program
since it began in 1982.
   It started then with only two churches _ Manhattan's St. Joseph's
Roman Catholic Church and Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church, but
has since spread to a wide inter-religious network.
   Besides the sheltering and feeding program, the partnership also
runs a permanent housing operation, Project Domicile, which has
helped relocate 3,700 homeless people from shelters and welfare
hotels to permanent apartments.
   Pike, also a director of the New York Landmarks Conservancy that
helps fund restoration of historic sites, said a criticial need in
reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system.
   It ``is not supportive of family life,'' he said. ``It ought to
support and encourage families to stay together and encourage
stability.''
   Under the circumstances, he said, ``Some of the most heroic
people in the country are women raising children.''
   Describing a sick, young woman with an eight-months-old infant
who fell into the subway tracks at Manhattan's Union Square and who
was lifted out just before a train roared in, he said:
   ``That's the New York Madonna.''

The lawsuits, filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, assert that the city's

<HEAD>More Than 1,300 Apply For Handful of Mining Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ROBRAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,300 people swarmed into a hotel
to apply for about two dozen jobs at a coal mine this week, a
turnout a company official Thursday called a sad statement about
eastern Kentucky's economy.
   ``I'm pleased on one hand but it's kind of depressing on the
other,'' said Ed Stone, personnel director for Sidney Coal Co.
   Some applicants drove more than 100 miles to apply for the 19 to
25 jobs that should be available when Sidney Coal's mine in Pike
County reopens early next year, Stone said.
   Most of the applicants were unemployed miners from Pike County
and surrounding areas in Kentucky and West Virginia, Stone said.
   The new hires would help during a yearlong renovation of the
mine, which eventually might employ about 100 people, he said.
   The volume of applications was the largest for such a small
number of jobs Stone said he had seen in 19 years of work in the
coal industry. The positions pay a minimum of $11 per hour and
include full benefits.
   Stone said he had begun sorting through the stacks of
applications filled out Monday and Tuesday. ``I'm going to have a
very short holiday,'' he said of the task.
   Sidney Coal was a focus of a bitter three-year selective strike
by the United Mine Workers. A.T. Massey Coal Co., which owns Sidney
Coal, agreed in May to pay $4.47 million to settle a lawsuit with
the UMW.
   The settlement called for 35 union miners to go back to work for
a contractor. The strike began when two mines owned by Sidney Coal
were sold to Massey in 1984 and Massey announced the mines would
become non-union.
   Despite the past union problems, a number of the people who
showed up to apply for the openings were past or present UMW
members, including union workers laid off this year from the Scotts
Branch Mine in northern Pike County.
   The unemployment rate for Pike County was 12.1 percent in
October, according to the latest figures available.
   ``I wish we could help everybody, but unfortunately we can't,''
Stone said.

   Milo Pike, another investor with a 9.9% stake in the Burlington, Mass., thrift, already has filed an application seeking to raise his stake to 24.9%. 
The Bank Board has informed Mr. Pike, that consideration of his application has been delayed pending receipt of additional information.

'BREAKING POINT' THRILLS IN HITCHCOCKIAN VEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNNE HEFFLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
An American intelligence officer, carrying vital knowledge about the Allies' 
planned invasion of Normandy, is captured and tortured by the Nazis. He wakes 
up in an American military hospital in Germany and learns the war has been over 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Or has it? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's TNT cable movie "Breaking Point," at 5 p.m. and again at 7, 9 and 11 
p.m., is an abundantly stylish remake of "36 Hours," the 1964 film with James 
Garner, Eva Marie Saint and Rod Taylor. Directed by Peter Markle and written by 
Stanley Greenberg, this suspense thriller in the Hitchcockian vein entangles 
both hero and audience in an intricate web of deception. 
</P>
<P>
Markle has cast his principal cast with care. Corbin Bernsen ("L.A. Law") is 
the bothered and bewildered amnesia victim, Maj. Jefferson Pike. His wife Diana 
is dead, he's told, but nurse Anna, a former inmate of Dachau -- or is she? -- 
hauntingly resembles her (exquisite Joanna Pacula plays both roles). Dr. Walter 
Gerber (John Glover), who seems to take Pike's case to heart, encourages Pike 
to cross the "psychological chasm" that blocks his memory by talking about what 
he last remembers: The plans for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
Director of photography Don Burgess' moody lighting makes a major contribution 
to the film's pervasive, vaguely threatening atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
There are some lapses. The physical evidence offered to Pike as proof of the 
postwar date is too slight. It was more substantial in the original film. And 
just as the original's finale bogged down, Greenberg, Markle and the fine cast 
don't altogether carry it off here either, despite fundamental script changes. 
The climactic chase scene is wildly self-indulgent; it could have been lifted 
from countless action films. 
</P>
<P>
Still, getting there is delicious, beginning with the opening credits, which 
roll over stark, black-and-white World War II newsreel footage as Billie 
Holiday's sweet, mournful voice is heard singing in the background.

<HEAD>`Breaking Point' Pointless Remake of 1964's `36 Hours'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The TNT movie ``Breaking Point'' is a remake
of the 1964 film ``36 Hours,'' starring James Garner and Eva Marie
Saint.
   The question is, why?
   Granted, the premise of the World War II thriller is intriguing _
the Nazis capture a U.S. intelligence officer and try to trick him
into thinking he's in a hospital suffering amnesia and the war is
over, so he'll reveal when and where the Allied invasion of Europe
is to take place.
   But it is certainly dated. And no matter how interesting the
premise, the story doesn't work if the viewers don't care what
happens to the characters. As weakly written as they are, they
aren't helped by a cast list that is an eery vision of
weeknight-on-the-dinner-theater-circuit.
   ``Breaking Point'' premieres tonight and is repeated Saturday and
Sunday.
   Corbin Bernsen, who does an admirable job of playing a crass,
shallow divorce lawyer on ``L.A. Law,'' would have been more
convincing as one of the Nazis. His Maj. Jefferson Pike comes off as
a vacuous dilettante who looks like he'd be much more comfortable
shopping for sweaters at Saks than plotting some nasty old invasion
of Normandy.
   The grinding wheels of the plot are set in motion when Pike goes
to an unexplained meeting with a unsavory character at a Lisbon bar,
drinks spiked espresso and is plucked off the sidewalk by the Nazis,
allowing director Peter Markle to ignore the plodding script for a
while and engage in some arty slo-mo and black-and-white photography.
   After a wee bit of electro-shock torture, which causes Pike to
grimace and perspire, he wakes up in a pleasant rest home surrounded
by seeming Yanks. The date on the newspaper is convincing enough,
but Pike is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the
mayor of Chicago and who won the World Series.
   Joanna Pacula, who is making a career of TV World War II dramas
(``Crossings,'' ``Escape from Sobibor''), plays Anna, the German
nurse enlisted to entice Pike into spilling the beans, because she
looks exactly like the wife the Nazis have told him is dead. No
wonder she and his wife look alike. She plays both of them. If not
for this amazing circumstance, the rest of the story would have been
tragically lost to posterity.
   Pike, aided by the miracle of flashbacks, figures out the Nazi
game. He confirms his suspicions by tripping Anna up with a bit of
clever dialogue, something about a paper cut received recently in
London _ A-ha! We're supposed to be in occupied Germany! Understand,
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants.
   Only the stalwart John Glover (``David'') inspires any interest,
playing Gerber, the Nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot.
   As a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting, the
preppy-looking David Marshall Grant (``thirtysomething'') plays a
Nazi commandant. His presence must satisfy some behind-the-scenes
debt we aren't aware of. His only plot purpose seems to be to menace
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of
Dr. Gerber's experiment. Not exactly the stuff of razor-edged
suspense.
   Unlike the 1964 film, ``Breaking Point'' ends with a cynical
twist, which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction,
but isn't particularly compelling as part of a historical drama.
Most viewers do know we won the war, don't they?
   Despite some wonderfully inane dialogue _ eg., Dr. Gerber: ``You
won't have to sleep with Major Pike again.'' Nurse Anna, with
straight face: ``Thank you, sir.'' _ the breaking point for most
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film.

Cosby's three previous books, ``Fatherhood,'' ``Time Flies'' and the

officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&amp;M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project that Pike leads in the
quest for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his round, yellow Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the
optimum planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co., said of the trend. ``You can see that by the
number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   The sweet spring onions are available only for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April. DeBerry's company and others have started
labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who
ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Texas onion growers got $77.8 million for their crop last year,
making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said Doug
Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say. Until the spring
onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter
storage variety grown in many states.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer. He also is researching the source of the 1015's mildness,
which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid, which
reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory
qualities in a more typical onion.
   ``Very rarely will you get one (1015) that will bring tears to
your eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.

   A men's climbing club plans to
celebrate the new year with a bang atop 14,110-foot Pikes Peak,
while a women's group plans a more sedate celebration on top of a
nearby mountain.
   The AdAmAn Club plans to set off $3,000 worth of fireworks,
including a barrage of rockets and mortar shells, from atop Pike's
Peak on New Year's Eve.
   It will be the 66th annual climb for the AdAmAn Club, which gets
its name from the practice of adding a new member each year, said
Jim Bates, the club historian.
   Meanwhile, the AdaWoman Club, formed in 1982 partly as a spoof
of the AdAmAn Club, planned to ring in 1990 with champagne and
$7.50 in sparklers atop 8,720-foot Pyramid Mountain.
   At midnight, the women plan to wave sparklers and sing, ``I Am

   Dorothy and her little dog, Toto,
survived a Kansas tornado, but a Michigan winter would have just
been too rough for the Hollywood types making a movie about
``Wizard of Oz'' creator L. Frank Baum.
   Baum wrote the story at his cottage on Lake Macatawa in western
Michigan, and some of the characters are believed to be based on
local people and places.
   So when NBC announced plans for the TV movie ``Dreamer of Oz,''
resort officials campaigned to have the movie filmed on location.
   But Michigan's unpredictable and often nasty winter weather
persuaded NBC to make the movie in sunny Southern California.
   ``The weather everywhere else is really unpredictable,'' said
NBC spokeswoman Kathi Banks. ``And the weather down here is the
same all year.''
   The movie is expected to air come spring.

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 2 rocket that
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into
space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.
   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles
had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second
time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a
week.
   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as
expected,'' said Air Force Capt. Norma Payne.
   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended
polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.
   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to
the Navy's White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System, an
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space
policy analyst John Pike said before the launch.
   ``The Navy really likes them,'' said Pike, of the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. ``They are very
important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''
   Pike said a White Cloud launch ``consists of one mother
satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is
reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in
polar orbit.
   The $37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West
and into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. Payne said at
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of
Lompoc, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.
   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable
of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.
   Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in
Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona, where they served as intercontinental
ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.
   But the missiles were removed from service ``because the
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had
a tendency to blow up,'' Pike said.
   The Air Force then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta Corp.
Air Force officials have said more are likely to be refurbished
because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new
rockets.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But a source close to the project,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the
upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was
little hope of salvaging that mission.
   Despite that failure, Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete''
Aldridge issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch,
declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''
   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new
boosters the Air Force will launch in the coming year,'' Aldridge
said. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the Delta 2 ... will ensure this
nation's access to space for many years to come.''
   The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently was
delayed by a fuel leak that the Air Force said spurred evacuation
of the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident,
officials said.
   Pike said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into
orbit from Vandenberg was a Defense Meteorological Support Program
satellite. But he called that unlikely.
   A Titan 2 exploded in its Arkansas silo on Sept. 19, 1980,
killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide
crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet
from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo
evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been
replaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles.
   Pike said Air Force officials have testified before Congress
that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one
launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches
of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a
classified program.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said.
   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar Ocean
Reconaissance Satellites, which monitor U.S. ship movements.

Despite the state attorney general's sudden leap into a yearlong legal fight to 
block a complex at the former site of the Pike amusement park, developers are 
vowing to go "right straight ahead" with work on one of the nation's largest 
renewal endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin by the end of next year on the oceanfront 
3-million-acre, $900-million "city-within-a-city," described by City Hall as 
the centerpiece of a downtown renaissance -- and by critics as an assault on 
the local environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going right straight ahead with the project," said Wayne Ratkovich, one 
of several influential developers for the Pike project. "We are not hesitating 
for a moment. We have a very low regard for the attorney general's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich was responding to a friend-of-the-court opinion filed last week by 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who said the city violated in environmental 
laws when it approved the Pike plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
The brief was a boost to 800 members of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and 
other area watchdog groups that have sued to stop the project, which would 
include 250 condominium units, a 300-suite hotel and 200,000 square feet of 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the project and other downtown developments will attract 
thousands of cars, pollute the air and turn surrounding neighborhoods into 
"freeway off-ramps." 
</P>
<P>
The critics lost in a trial earlier this year, then turned to the state Court 
of Appeal, where Van de Kamp's opinion will be considered along with volumes of 
evidence. A hearing date is pending. 
</P>
<P>
But Ratkovich -- an influential businessman known for restoring the Wiltern 
Theatre complex and other historic buildings in Los Angeles -- said he is 
confident that the lawsuit will ultimately fail and that Long Beach will see 
the completion of a development that has been likened to Embarcadero Center in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine," Ratkovich said, "that an attorney general of any state is so 
wise and so all-seeing and all-knowing that he has . . . greater wisdom than 
the citizens of Long Beach, the (city) Planning Commission, the Redevelopment 
Agency, the state Coastal Commission and the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say a nest of downtown buildings already approved by the city would 
bring 114,000 more cars into town daily -- more than one-third of them 
generated by the Pike project. (That figure does not take into account the 
resort and theme park proposal that was recently unveiled by Walt Disney Co., 
which could attract 13 million tourists a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and others argue that the city broke the law 
by failing to consider the total of environmental damage that mammoth 
development could bring -- further stressing Ocean Boulevard, 7th Street, 
Broadway and other beleaguered east-west corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those streets are already crowded," Long Beach Area Citizens Involved attorney 
Marc Allen Coleman said. "Where are they going to put 114,000 more cars? The 
law says you cannot approve a project until these kinds of problems are 
mitigated. I can't believe they are planning a city this way." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and developers contend that environmental problems have been 
considered and that steps have been taken to make sure Long Beach can absorb 
such impacts, not to mention the wealth of tax revenue new development would 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Shirey said: "We recognize that whether it be 
Disney or the Pike project or somebody who wants to expand a hot dog stand, 
there will be traffic issues. But we think people underestimate the ability of 
the current transportation system to handle traffic in Long Beach . . . and 
they underestimate our resolve to make sure those problems are worked out." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are confident that the Pike project will ultimately go forward. 
But, they wonder, when? 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Pike were unveiled with great fanfare two years ago. But the land 
south of Ocean Boulevard between Magnolia and Pine avenues remains an ugly 
patchwork of vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for downtown," Community Development Director Susan Shick 
said, "so we would like to see it started. A major project is always better 
under construction than simply talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Shick and others looked to the slumping economy, the savings and loan crisis 
and a general "real estate trough" to explain the apparent delay. 
</P>
<P>
But developers said the project is not behind schedule at all, just moving 
steadily through a maze of conditions to put together a virtually 
self-contained community of homes, shops, hotel rooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich said: "The architects are hard at work, and there are armies of 
engineers gathering in Long Beach as we speak. There is an enormous amount of 
work to do on a project this size." 
</P>
<P>
After the project won full approval last year, developers retained New 
York-based Salomon Bros. Inc. to help them market the idea in what is now a 
global search for investors. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hart, manager of Pike Properties Associates, would not discuss financing 
details, other than to say it is going "very well." Pike Properties -- a 
partnership of the Ratkovich Co., Enterprise Development Co. of Columbia, Md., 
and Copley Real Estate Advisers of Boston -- bought the site in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the real estate slump would not affect a project of this size, which 
would be built over 15 years and through two or three real estate cycles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with investors who have the capacity to invest in a $900-million 
project," Hart said. "These are people with a very long-term view. We're not 
selling a building that will be occupied tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the project's four phases will be decided according to the demands of 
the market of the day, Hart said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Sees Shift of Research and Development Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon research official said Friday that
the U.S. defense industrial base is being hurt by American
companies' increasing shift of research and development activities
overseas.
   ``I'm very concerned about the movement of research and
development offshore,'' said Craig I. Fields, deputy director for
research of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   Fields said that while companies may have made the ``right
business decision'' in the short run, such a trend is likely to
have an adverse impact on this country's long-term military and
economic capabilities.
   He also expressed concern about the ``increasing dependency of
the Defense Department on foreign components and technologies.''
   DARPA has sought to bolster U.S. capabilities by channeling
research funds into key technologies _ including advanced
semiconductors, supercomputers and so-called artificial
intelligence _ with both military and civilian applications.
   Fields, speaking at a conference sponsored by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, said much more needs to
be done to coordinate U.S. longer-term defense research aims with
programs of civilian agencies such as the Commerce Department.
   ``It has to be a government-wide posture, not a defense posture
alone,'' he said.
   Jacques Gansler, a former Pentagon official, called for the
formulation of an overall ``defense industrial technology
strategy'' to guide military research and development efforts.
   Currently U.S. weapons ``are being designed so that they are
incredibly expensive and so complex that they won't work,'' said
Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp., a
research company in suburban Arlington, Va.
   He said that with greater emphasis on manufacturing process
technology, the nation's defense industries should be able to
achieve higher quality production at lower cost.
   Also speaking at the conference was John Pike, associate
director for space policy of the Federation of American Scientists,
a Washington-based public interest group.
   Pike, a long-time critic of the Star Wars missile defense
effort, said that the program _ formally called the Strategic
Defense Initiative _ now appears to be firmly entrenched and on the
verge of demonstrating ``real technological results.''
   With the scaling-down of Star Wars goals from a complete nuclear
shield to defense of selected U.S. military targets, Pike said,
``at least we're dealing with a system whose cost and performance
goals are not obviously absurd.''
   Reagan announced the research effort in a televised speech in
March 1983. For the current fiscal year, $4.1 billion is provided
for SDI. Reagan's last budget requested an increase to $5.9 billion
for the 1990 fiscal year.
   ``Beginning this year we are going to start seeing real tests of
real hardware,'' including high-powered lasers, Pike said.

   Higher prices are cropping up in
Florida restaurants, especially those offering vegetarian fare, in
the wake of the Christmas freeze that wiped out much of the state's
winter farms.
   A few restaurant owners say they've had to raise prices just to
break even.
   ``I'm a vegetarian restaurant, so I'm feeling more than a
pinch,'' said James McKenna, owner of the Ciao Sidewalk Cafe in
Delray Beach, 20 miles north.
   McKenna said a few weeks ago he was buying tomatoes for $8.50 a
case, but now he is paying $23. As a result, he raised the price of
the meal-sized salads at his cafe by 25 cents Thursday.
   The Taurus Steak House in Miami's Coconut Grove section has been
adding a $1.75 surcharge for their salad bar since the day after
Christmas because fo the higher vegetable prices, said Dave Hill
Jr., the restaurant's manager.
   At Ruby Tuesday chain restaurants, the prices have not changed,
but some days they've left cherry tomatoes and green peppers off
salads.
   ``We have not increased our prices, but we've had to delete a
few items,'' said Craig Marcy, a senior assistant at Ruby Tuesday
in Fort Lauderdale's Broward Mall.
   Most big restaurant chains are bearing the cost without changes.
   ``We're just absorbing the extra cost,'' said Cheri Grey of the
Steak &amp; Ale regional headquarters in Tampa. ``This is just short
term.''
   Prices fluctuate in any market and effect the restaurant
industry, said Frank Pike, chairman of the board of the Palm Beach
County Chapter of the Florida Restaurant Association.
   ``This happens in a multitude of categories _ beef, stone
crabs,'' Pike said. ``They can't change their prices every time the
market fluctuates.''
   Pike said it is too early to assess the impact of increased
vegetable costs on the restaurant industry as a whole.

   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&amp;M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project Pike leads in the quest
for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the optimum
planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' said Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co. ``You can see that by the number of tourists
who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of winter Texans drove up
to his company near the border town of Progreso, but the round,
yellow 1015s weren't in yet.
   The sweet spring onions are only available for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April.
   DeBerry's company and others have started labeling the 1015s
with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Onions last year brought $77.8 million to onion producers in
Texas, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said
Doug Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   Until the spring onions hit the market, consumers are eating the
more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer.
   He also is researching just what makes the 1015 mild, and said
it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic
acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that
give the vegetable a bad image.
   ``Very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your
eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.
   Bob Scarborough, who manages gift packages for Bartlett Groves
in McAllen, said his company started shipping the special boxes of
onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus
for several years.
   ``As a matter of fact, I still have a little trouble with it
when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges
or grapefruits,'' Scarborough said.

<HEAD>Police Officers Guilty in Queens Stun Gun Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police sergeant and a suspended officer
were convicted Wednesday of torturing a drug suspect with an
electric stun gun three years ago.
   In addition, a former officer was convicted of beating of the
man at his home, and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of
abetting the beating.
   The defendants were among several police officers from the same
Queens precinct implicated in 1985 in the alleged torture of drug
suspects with the stun gun, which delivers a powerful, temporarily
disabling jolt of up to 40,000 volts.
   Everton Evelyn had testified that four officers beat him in his
home in 1985, and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him
at the station, holding him down and giving him shocks from the
hand-held device.
   The 34-year-old taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used
on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time. He has
also filed a $50 million lawsuit against the city and the Police
Department.
   Former Sgt. Richard Pike and suspended Officer Loren MacCary
were convicted of assault, official misconduct and coercion and
could receive up to seven years in prison.
   Jeffrey Gilbert, a former officer, was convicted of the same
charges in the beating. Suspended Lt. Steven Cheswick, who
supervised the other three, was convicted of official misconduct
and faces up to a year in jail.
   The jury had begun deliberating Monday afternoon.
   Pike was found guilty in both the beating and the stun gun
attack; MacCary was convicted in the stun gun attack; and Gilbert
was found guilty in the beating.
   Cheswick, prosecutors said, had blocked Evelyn's wife from
aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the
beating.
   The four defendants will be sentenced March 29.
   The trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the
106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in
1985. Pike and Gilbert already are serving two to six years for
their convictions in the first trial, in 1986.

   At most rodeos, the crowd cheers for the
cowboy to stay atop the bucking bull. Bobby Rowe cheers for the
bull.
   Rowe lavishes love and kindness on his bulls in hopes that a few
will grow into the ornery 1,500-pound rodeo demons that throw the
toughest cowboys.
   Rowe, a former world champion saddle bronc rider, is looking for
a commercial formula for raising bucking bulls on a farm near
Dickson.
   ``It's like you can take five men, give them a ditch to dig,
tell them to do it and four of them won't get it done,'' Rowe said.
``That's the same with bulls. Some buck and some won't. It's a
matter of heart and attitude.''
   Rowe raises the bulls on the 1,400-acre Highland Rim Farm, which
he has operated for three years for owner Henry McCall.
   Hooked on the rodeo since he was a teen-ager, Rowe has developed
an eye for good bucking bulls over the years. The trainer first
tests the animals with mechanical riders and sends those that
continue bucking to Maury, Ky., to work out with a rodeo team.
   After more tests at local events the best bulls travel the
national rodeo circuit.
   ``That's the ones I like,'' Rowe said. ``I'm looking for the
best.''

   Unpack your parkas and pull out your
shovels _ the woolly bear caterpillars here are pointing to a long,
cold, snowy winter.
   Springfield highway chief Philip Pike, who presides over a
$935,600 snow plowing budget, hauled out three woolly bear
caterpillars Tuesday and declared it's going to be touch and go
whether the city will have enough funds to clear the streets this
winter.
   Pike maintains that measuring the width of the orange stripe on
the caterpillars and the bushiness of squirel tails is as reliable
a system as any for the annual municipal guessing game of how much
money to keep in the snow plowing accounts.
   ``What the heck. We have some fun with it and I've got as good a
record as anyone,'' Pike said. Circumstances permitting, of course.
Pike made no prediction last year because he couldn't find any
caterpillars.
   On one of the three test caterpillars he unscientifically
scooped up last weekend, the orange band takes up nearly the whole
body. On the other two it is much larger than the brown.
   The wider the orange, the more snow, he allowed. And the
squirrels in city parks have such bushy tails it's certain to be
cold as well, he contended.

   Nick Ameli Sr., who has worked at the
Bluewell Fire Department for 40 years, apologizes that he isn't as
active a firefighter as he was some years ago.
   Ameli is 83.
   ``Mostly I direct traffic now and answer the phone. More often I
make sure the men have coffee and refreshments waiting when they
return to the station after a call,'' he said.
   After 24 years as a miner, Ameli moved to Bluewell, where he
became a firefighter. He was one of the founders of the Volunteer
Fire Department and after retirement became an equally busy
volunteer.
   Today, he is proud of the three generations of Amelis who are
volunteer firefighters.
   A plaque placed on the fire house honors Ameli for work he did
on the building, which was completed in 1969.
   ``They didn't have any money to pay me for the work so the
plaque was put up,'' Ameli said. ``It will last longer than the
money would have anyway.''

Corona del Mar Coach John Vargas was overcome with emotion after his Sea Kings 
had defeated El Dorado, 7-6, on Saturday to reach the Southern Section 4-A 
water polo final. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible feeling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best? 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . if you want to get technical, the second best," said Vargas, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
The best would come on Wednesday, if the Sea Kings can beat Villa Park in the 
final. But for now, Vargas will be happy with what he's got. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sixth consecutive season that the Sea Kings have reached the final. 
They have won two consecutive championships and three of the past four. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, getting there was a problem. Corona del Mar (27-3) had lost 
twice to El Dorado during the regular season, including the final of the 
California state tournament at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
In both of those games, Corona del Mar had opportunities and had failed to 
capitalize. This time, it was El Dorado (25-4), the No. 1 seeded team, which 
let chances get away. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings rallied from a 2-0 deficit to take a 4-2 halftime lead. But in 
the third quarter, the Golden Hawks put on the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Maclear scored with less than a minute gone in the second half to cut the 
Sea Kings' lead to 4-3. El Dorado then had three chances to score, but came 
away with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
With a man advantage, the Golden Hawks worked the ball in close to Larry Felix, 
but his shot was blocked by goalie Rob Pike. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks were again on the attack with a man advantage. This time, 
however, bad luck denied them. 
</P>
<P>
First, Kyle Utsumi beat Pike to the left, but his shot hit the post. El Dorado 
got the rebound and worked the ball around to the left wing, but Jim Leonard's 
shot hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Leonard hit the post with another shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings weathered the attacks and then scored two goals to take a 6-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances, we just didn't cash them in," El Dorado Coach John Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Golden Hawks would keep getting them. In the fourth quarter, Utsumi 
scored two goals in 23 seconds to get El Dorado within 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks had two chances to tie. The first shot, by Greg Milton, hit 
the post, and the second, by Maclear, was blocked by Pike. 
</P>
<P>
Pike finished with 10 saves, seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a perfect example of team defense," Vargas said. "Everybody worked 
together and helped each other." 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first two encounters, the Sea Kings had trouble holding onto the 
ball against the Golden Hawk defense. Corona del Mar turned the ball over five 
times in the first quarter and only took one shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, El Dorado led only 1-0 after the first quarter, on a goal by Maclear. 
The Golden Hawks missed three open shots and three others were blocked by Pike. 
</P>
<P>
"Being down only one goal was a blessing," Vargas said. "I think we were too up 
for this game. I told the kids to move around more, and that helped settle them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar did, scoring four goals in the second quarter. Ryan Weir, who 
had four goals in the game, and Gunnar Gustafson each scored two in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings then turned away the Golden Hawks in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
But not the best, technically. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the other 4-A semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 8, Sunny Hills 5 -- The Spartans (25-4) reached the final for the 
first time in six years with a victory at Newport Harbor High School. Villa 
Park had been eliminated in the quarterfinals every year since reaching the 3-A 
championship game in 1982. Gavin Arroyo scored four goals, including one with 
3:14 left, to give the Spartans a 7-4 lead. Villa Park led, 4-1, at halftime, 
but Sunny Hills (20-9) got within 4-3 in the third quarter. Gary Larson and 
Neal Brockmeier each had two goals for Villa Park.

<HEAD>Pi Kappa Alpha Kicked Out Of Stetson University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hazing incident has led to the banishment
of a Stetson University fraternity that got into trouble over rape
allegations against several members last year.
   The Baptist-affiliated school announced Wednesday that it had
withdrawn recognition of Pi Kappa Alpha as a result of an
investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a
public stunt and inflicted mental abuse.
   A Nov. 9 incident involving frat members, known as ``Pikes,'' in
the Ocala National Forest reflected poorly on the campus'
fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement.
It did not give details of the hazing.
   As a result of Stetson's action, Pi Kappa Alpha's national
office suspended the fraternity's charter, and the organization's
executive director said he will try to have the chapter kicked out.
   A fraternity member, the Stetson chapter, the national
organization and the university have been sued by a woman who told
investigators she was raped during a night of heavy drinking and
dancing at the Pike house in April 1988.
   The state attorney's office investigated the rape complaint
against two fraternity brothers. It found that they did have sexual
contact with the woman but said rape could not be proved.
   The woman's attorney, Sheldon Stevens, said additional
fraternity members would be added to the lawsuit before it goes to
trial.
   Four Pikes were suspended for one semester as a result of that
incident, and the fraternity was prohibited from participating in
social activities or sporting events.
   Steve Cox, Pi Kappa Alpha's national executive director, said
the Stetson chapter had been one category below a fully accredited
chapter since last spring.
   University officials will not elaborate on the school's actions
or make public the results of the investigation, said college
spokeswoman Jacqueline D. Kersh.
   The university defines hazing as ``any action taken or situation
created by the members of a fraternity intentionally, whether on or
off fraternity premises, to produce any physical or psychological
harm to the individual.''

   Gnarlatious Novels: Lurid Thrillers for the Teen Set

   Christopher Pike is understandably edgy about seeing his
real name in print. When his true identity was revealed in a
trade magazine article several years ago, the results were
disastrous.
   "A bunch of kids found out where I lived and I had to
move," said Mr. Pike, the pseudonymous author of some 20
thrillers for teens. "It spread like a rumor where I was . .
. It got weird. I have very intense fans."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to novels such as "Slumber Party" and "Scavenger
Hunt," Mr. Pike, a 35-year-old former computer programmer who
took his nom de plume from the first captain of the Starship
Enterprise, has a cult following that would do any MTV rocker
or sitcom star proud. Some 100 fan letters choke his mailbox
each week.
   Mr. Pike is one of the unsung, un-Pulitzered celebrities
of today's literary scene, one of a handful of writers who
churn out wildly popular spooky tales and murder mysteries
tailored for teenagers.
   Teen thrillers are the biggest thing to happen to the
young-adult book market since Nancy Drew drove on the scene
in her blue roadster.
   Publishers are tight-lipped on the subject of sales. Mr.
Pike's publisher, Pocket Books, would reveal only that more
than two million copies of the highly popular writer's
paperbacks would be shipped to bookstores this year.
Apparently, a lot of them will sell: Teen thrillers make
regular appearances on the weekly best-seller lists
circulated by trade bookstores.
   Head for the young-adult section of any chain bookstore
and you'll see them: rows of luridly jacketed paperbacks with
titles such as "The Cheerleader" ("She would do anything to
be popular"), "Blind Date" ("It wasn't a date. It was a
nightmare"), and "Final Exam" ("If you fail . . . you'll just
die"). No teen-related stone is left unturned. "Prom Dress,"
reads the jagged orange title on one Lael Littke book, over
an eerily glowing white gown. "It's a dress to die for . . ."
   These books aren't Newbery Award contenders, but even
librarians find them hard to dismiss. "Well, my personal
philosophy is, if they're reading anything at all that's
wonderful," said Molly Kinney, a librarian with the
Miami-Dade Public Library system, who reviews young adult
thrillers for School Library Journal. "They're also a way to
get involved with something . . . evil without ever acting on
it."
   Certainly they don't get much more evil than Christopher
Pike, who is hailed as the Stephen King of teen fiction. Mr.
Pike's novels feature an assortment of stalkers, psychos and
killer co-eds that would make Nancy Drew's pageboy flip stand
on end. Take Alexa, the homicidal cheerleader and cocaine
fiend of "Die Softly":
   "She just knelt right in front of me, kind of like a
sacrifice," Alexa says, describing how she offed her ex-best
friend Lisa. "I brought the bat down on her head quickly. The
wood cracked -- so did her skull . . . The blood gushed over
her blond hair. It was much darker than I thought it would
be."
   If Mr. Pike's novels are gorier than most, they also boast
some of the more inventively sexy plots. In "Die Softly," an
amateur photographer sets up a camera in the girls' showers
to get shots of naked cheerleaders, only to end up with
photos of a murder. In "Remember Me," a vapid high school
co-ed returns from the dead to find out who pushed her off a
balcony at a party -- taking time out to spy on her boyfriend
with his new squeeze.
   "Teenagers are very fascinated by the subject of life
after death," Mr. Pike said. "I got very beautiful letters
from kids who say they were going to kill themselves before
they read that book."
   Despite his apparent hot line to the teen psyche, Mr. Pike
never set out to write for young adults. A college dropout,
he spent years writing science fiction that no one would
publish. Then his agent suggested he try his hand at a teen
thriller. "Slumber Party" -- about a group of girls stalked
by a killer on a ski weekend -- came out in 1985, and he
hasn't stopped writing thrillers since.
   "They kept offering me more money," Mr. Pike explained.
"But I enjoy it . . . teenage characters are so extreme."
   Nightmare-prone readers may find Mr. Pike's characters a
little too extreme: The evil Alexa kills the photographer
hero of "Die Softly" by forcing him to snort a lethal amount
of cocaine.
   Not all publishers permit this kind of brutality. "Nobody
actually dies in Scholastic thrillers," said Lenora Todaro, a
senior publicist for Scholastic. "People appear murdered, but
they usually show up at the end."
   Safe scares are part of the appeal of R.L. Stine. He draws
the 10-to-12-year-old crowd with his popular "Fear Street"
series -- set in the creepy town of Shadyside -- and with
novels such as "The Baby-Sitter" and "Beach Party." Although
they have their share of spooks and stalkers, these stories
are as safe as a roller-coaster ride in a kiddie amusement
park -- with more false alarms than a semester's worth of
fire drills.
   "With a hideous ear-shattering screech, something leaped
out of the darkness at them," ends one chapter of Mr. Stine's
"Party Summer," in which four teens are stranded in the
lonely Howling Wolf Inn. Scared? Don't worry. It's only a
bat.
   "Kids love the cliffhanger chapter endings," Mr. Stine
explained.
   Although he has written nearly 100 books for children --
including many joke books under the moniker Jovial Bob Stine
-- the 47-year-old author seems a little mystified by the
popularity of his 20-odd thrillers, which he now turns out
about once a month.
   "It's creepy," he said. "I ask kids all the time, `Why do
you read this stuff?' . . . I get letters saying, `I was
screaming so loud my parents came running into the room.' I
love that. It's being scared and being safe at the same
time."
   Mr. Stine's books are particularly teen-friendly because
he makes a serious effort to pepper them with current
Teenspeak gleaned from MTV and his 10-year-old son, Matthew.
   "For sure, dude. Gnarly," observes one of the characters
in "Party Summer." "Gnarlatious]" her ponytailed male admirer
responds.
   If Mr. Stine does firsthand linguistic research, at least
one teen thriller author claims to base her stories on
firsthand experience with the supernatural. "I had a haunted
childhood," said Richie Tankersley Cusick, author of seven
thrillers. "We did have a ghost in our house. He was there
for years. He was very mischievous . . . he would throw all
the Christmas ornaments in the middle of the floor."
   The evil-doers who haunt Ms. Cusick's fiction do more
damage than that. "Don't call for help," a blurb on the cover
of "The Lifeguard" warns. "He may just kill you." In fact,
this psycho in swim trunks just about ruins Kelsey's
vacation, leaving clumps of seaweed in her bedroom and the
odd dead body on the beach.
   But that's nothing next to the nasty surprise that the
heroine of "April Fools" finds in her mailbox: "The scream
she'd been holding back rose into her throat and stuck there,
the awful hideous thing in her hand looking back at her
beneath a smeared coating of mashed entrails. It was a head."
A doll's head, that is.
   In order to write such scary prose, it helps to be a
little bit spooked yourself. To get herself in the mood, Ms.
Cusick works at an antique rolltop desk that once belonged to
a funeral director (she thinks it may be haunted), as
soundtracks from horror movies play in the background.
   They help ward off the biggest nightmare of all. "When you
have writer's block it's good to put them on," Ms. Cusick
said. "I use them for inspiration."

<HEAD>Tornado Hits Georgia; High Winds and Rain Across Alabama</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CBS1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A violent storm front packing tornado-like winds and at least
one confirmed tornado racked parts of Georgia and Alabama this
morning, flipping trailer homes and downing trees and power lines
and critically injuring three people.
   Initial damage reports from Columbus, Ga., where the tornado
touchdown was confirmed, were sketchy. In Alabama, authorities
reported serious damage and injuries near Opp, which was hit by
tornado-like winds shortly before dawn, and to the northeast in
Pike County,.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a radio reporter with
station WOPP in Opp, a town of 7,000 about 60 miles north of the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The storm hit the town at about 5:50 a.m., knocking out power
and covering streets with the mangled remains of trees. Witnesses
said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some
neighborhoods showed widespread damage.
   At least 15 injures were reported in Alabama. Six people
required hospitalization, including three who were critically
injured in Pike County when a twister or tornado-force winds
demolished trailer homes. The entire state remained under a flash
flood watch.
   The storm system coursed into Georgia from the southwest,
sending a tornado spinning into Columbus at about 9:15 a.m.
   ``We have no severe damage that we know about,'' said Joy
Burnham, the city's emergency management director. She said some
damage was reported at a car dealership, and some roofs and trees
were blown down.
   Phone lines were down in the downtown Columbus area, according
to Southern Bell spokeswoman Lynne Bress. Georgia Power Co.
spokeswoman Meg Reggie said only a few hundred customers were
without power.
   It was the second tornado in downtown Columbus this month. On
Feb. 10, the city was hit by one of several twisters that touched
down in Georgia during a storm.
   In northern Georgia, where 10 inches or more of rain fell on
some sections last week, the National Weather Service predicted up
to 2 inches of rain today as the storms moved through.
   ``Everybody up here's praying for good things to happen,'' said
Trion Mayor Hoyt Williams, whose town was one of the worst hit by
the earlier rain. ``I don't know what protective measures to take.
Do you?''
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris has asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster aid for nine counties _ Carroll, Chattooga, Cobb,
Douglas, Fannin, Gilmer, Gordon, Murray and Walker _ because of
recent floods and tornadoes.
   A flash flood watch issued by the National Weather Service for
today covered an area that included Atlanta, Athens and Rome.
   Harris estimated Monday that storms since Feb. 10 have killed
six people and injured 32 in the state. He said 39 homes were
destroyed, while 470 houses and 129 businesses were damaged.
   In Alabama, the most severe damage today appeared to follow a
northeast path from Opp through Pike County into Barbour County. In
Pike County, officials said four people were injured in mobile
homes and a pickup truck was blown into a tree; in Barbour County,
sheriff's deputy R.H. Johnson said four house trailers were damaged.
   Trees and power lines also were snapped off in Chambers, Lee,
Tallapoosa, Bullock and Houston counties, and the wind was clocked
at 76 mph in Dothan.
   An elementary school in Auburn was closed after high winds sent
two trees crashing into the building. No injuries were reported. A
middle school at Auburn also was closed by a power outage.

<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after the Hatfield-McCoy
feud ended, West Virginia is embroiled in a polite debate on the
propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed.
   Guides at Chief Logan State Park led three-hour tours of Feudin'
Country during a weeklong festival that ended Sunday. The show
included films, slide shows, music and souvenirs.
   ``This part of the state doesn't have high mountains and
waterfalls, but we do have the most interesting history,'' said
Alvin Gale, a park ranger who leads the tours. ``It's not something
to be proud of, but it is history.''
   ``I guess things had to be settled one way or another,'' said
Liz Clay, 66, who went on one of the tours last week. ``That's
life, honey. To know what went on years ago.''
   At least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the McCoy clan
of Pike County, Ky., against the Hatfield clan of Logan County,
W.Va., part of which is now Mingo County.
   No one knows what prompted the bloodshed. Speculation centers on
a stolen hog and a Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two members of
the families. Whatever set it off, it took the intervention of the
governors of two states to bring peace in 1888.
   The tour covers five cemeteries, two dilapidated houses, one
battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three McCoy
brothers were slain by the Hatfields.
   Only one Kentucky cemetery is included, and some Kentuckians
have half-jokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward
West Virginia. State officials say they left out Kentucky sites
because they were too far away.
   While many revel in the homespun notoriety, some historians
contend that reviving the Hatfield-McCoy feud perpetuates ugly
stereotypes of Appalachians.
   ``To me, it's very sad for this to be a commercial thing. It's
playing on a stereotype which I don't like,'' said Altina L.
Waller, a former history professor at West Virginia University
whose book, ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' recently was published by the University
of North Carolina press.
   ``On the other hand, it's sort of coming to terms with
history,'' Waller said.
   The publicity, which pops up frequently in national magazines
and newspapers, may hurt the area more than help it, said Ron
Eller, director of the Appalachian Center at the University of
Kentucky.
   ``There's probably been few other things in Appalachian history
that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the
Hatfield-McCoy feud,'' Eller said. ``The national imagery is that
they were backwoods, isolated mountain farmers. In reality, they
were very important families who competed for land access that
would lead to economic development.''
   The tours in West Virginia are spurring some interest in Pike
County, where the Preservation Council of Pike County wants to
arrange similar tours. Sites would include the remnants of the
house where the stolen hog trial was held; the place where a
Hatfield supporter was hanged; and the grave of Randolph McCoy,
patriarch of the McCoy clan.
   ``Since it is an internationally known part of our heritage, we
need to capitalize on it,'' said Betsy Venters, the council's
president. ``It's something that the present generation wants to
know more about.''
   Pike County Judge-Executive Paul Patton isn't so sure.
   ``The Hatfield-McCoy feud is one thing that most people are
aware of. I guess people hold on to that as one thing that might
grow into a significant tourist industry,'' he said. But ``it
certainly might not promote the type of image we want.''

   Japan Can Expect Little Help With Yen
   From Its Partners in G-7, Analysts Say

   TOKYO -- The need for Bank of Japan to raise interest
rates could increase if the meeting by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations this weekend offers little help in
supporting the yen, analysts say.
   They say Japan can expect little succor from the U.S. and
other major partners. So Bank of Japan may have to gradually
start tightening in the money market as a prelude to boosting
the official discount rate for the fifth time in a row since
last May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That may be harder this time around as interest rates are
now at the level where further increases could seriously hurt
the economy, some analysts caution. Bank of Japan's
tightening this past year has only reversed the easing over
the previous few years.
   What Japan needs from the G-7 meeting in Paris among
Japan, the U.S., West Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Canada
is some coordinated interest rate action with the U.S.,where
the Federal Reserve eased rates as Bank of Japan raised them.
This would repay the easing that Japan pursued for several
years after the Plaza Accord 1985 to support the dollar. The
accord was the first agreement by the G-7 for coordinated
attempts to keep the dollar within certain ranges.
   But "what they'll get is probably little but warm words
about coordinated policy," says David Pike, chief economist
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International Ltd. As a result, there
will be "a shift of focus back onto the Bank of Japan and a
fifth hike in the ODR {official discount rate}."
   The Japanese believe that now "it is time for the U.S. to
play its international role and help us out of our trouble,"
Mr. Pike says. "They helped the Americans . . . with a
relatively lax monetary policy. Now they are counting the
costs."
   But the U.S. hasn't shown much willingness to help.
   "Domestic considerations will continue to dictate U.S.
{monetary} policy," which is concerned more about inflation
than the yen, Mr. Pike says.
   "Unless the U.S. eases monetary policy, we can't expect
much appreciation in the Japanese yen," says Susumu Kato,
senior economist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. But he said
he doesn't expect any immediate policy change by the Fed.
   "To stabilize foreign exchange, Japan doesn't want to have
to raise interest rates but instead wants other countries to
lower their interest rates," says Takashi Tsuchiya, economist
at Tokai Bank. "But the U.S. probably won't lower interest
rates, and West Germany probably won't either. If this
happens, then the yen will weaken further."
   Mr. Kato of Goldman Sachs says it is likely that the yen
will be traded around 155 to the dollar even after the G-7
meeting. The dollar was trading in New York at around 157.45
yen Thursday, down from 158.95 yen in New York late
Wednesday.
   However, the Tokyo stock market's prolonged decline and
the slowing of the economy may make Bank of Japan even more
wary of acting suddenly and severely than in the past, some
analysts say.
   Any tightening is likely to be gradual and well advertised
to avoid spooking the Japanese financial markets further, the
analysts contend. "It is very difficult to expect any
monetary policy change given the very fragile financial
markets," says Mr. Kato.
   "The BOJ is going to be fairly reluctant and the Ministry
of Finance will be out-and-out against" boosting the discount
rate again, says Mr. Pike of UBS. So "it is likely to be
fairly well sign-posted."
   Yet market participants contend that, by delaying a boost
in March, the ministry's reluctance prevented any impact on
the dollar's upward momentum and further eroded Bank of
Japan's credibility. With Japanese interest rates starting to
attract the interest of investors in the yen, their
confidence that Bank of Japan has the freedom to do what is
needed to defend the currency and fight inflation is more
crucial than ever.
   Bank of Japan has to make definite moves that reassure
investors, says Mr. Pike of UBS. But if the central bank does
want to take the public step of raising the discount rate
again, he says, "we will get the usual bickering" with the
Finance Ministry.
   Expecting a boost of 0.75 to one percentage point in June
or July, Takahide Furuhashi, head of research at DB Capital
Markets Asia Ltd., says the way it is carried out will
determine its impact. "If they are forced to raise the ODR
hike like the one we had before, it will have no effect at
all," Mr. Furuhashi says.

AS SPACE STATION PREPARES TO GO UP, FEARS GROW ABOUT IT COMING DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
NASA: THE AGENCY SAYS FAILURE IS 'HIGHLY UNLIKELY.' BUT ENGINEERS ARE STUDYING 
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 'UNPLANNED RE-ENTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When things go NASA's way, what goes up doesn't necessarily come back down. 
</P>
<P>
With scores of satellites uneventfully orbiting Earth, the space agency's track 
record is hard to assail. Yet when things go wrong, the failures can be 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
During the 77-ton Skylab's fiery plunge in 1979, there was massive 
hand-wringing around the world. Luckily, the debris fell harmlessly into the 
Indian Ocean and Australia's outback. 
</P>
<P>
But what if something three times the size of Skylab -- or roughly the size of 
the U.S. Capitol building -- were to experience, in NASA's words, an 
"accidental inadvertent re-entry"? 
</P>
<P>
That the much-touted space station, scheduled to be completed within 10 years, 
could fall from the sky, damaging property and taking lives, has largely been 
obscured by the public fascination with its futuristic design and unquestioned 
central role in U.S. space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Now two recent reports have served to spotlight that scenario, one that NASA 
says is utterly remote. 
</P>
<P>
But one prominent space scientist says that simple arithmetic -- based on 
NASA's own numbers -- shows that there is a strong likelihood, not just a 
possibility, that the 500-foot, 290-ton space station could run out of the fuel 
it needs to maintain orbit, thus falling back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, in a recently released draft environmental impact statement on the space 
station, said specifically that the chances of the facility ever falling are 
"highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
It nevertheless candidly acknowledged that there could be two types of 
"unplanned re-entries" -- controlled and uncontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
In a controlled re-entry, NASA said, the space station could be steered on a 
course of descent that would minimize any "resulting footprint" -- in other 
words, away from population centers. 
</P>
<P>
But an out-of-control space station "could produce a debris footprint at a 
random location," NASA conceded. Its environmental impact statement left the 
rest to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The $30-billion project is considered the steppingstone to the exploration of 
the moon, Mars, the rest of the solar system and beyond. Its construction, not 
yet under way, is expected to take about five years. It will be 1995 at the 
earliest before the first components are launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom -- the largest spacecraft ever assembled -- is being designed to 
spend no less than 30 years in orbit 150 to 270 miles above Earth at 18,000 
m.p.h., circumnavigating it every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the current designs are to be thoroughly re-examined because of emerging 
concerns among some NASA engineers, expressed in a recent interim report, that 
the space station's intricate components may require extensive repair and 
maintenance in outer space long before astronauts have it fully assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers said the space station could be only 60% to 70% complete before 
space-walking astronauts may have to turn from assembling it to performing 
inspections, maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"With any long, strung-out process of assembly, you're running a risk of 
components breaking down," said Charles R. Price, a NASA engineer the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult problems is to establish failure rate of components; 
that's predicting the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The potential flaws, involving solar power panels, various electronic devices 
and assorted structural components, also could require astronauts to spend 
dangerously large amounts of time working outside the space station, thus 
exposing themselves to excessive radiation and debris. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's environmental impact statement identified several possible causes for 
the space station or some of its components to plunge to Earth: 
</P>
<P>
* Failure of multiple and major on-board systems. 
</P>
<P>
* Collision with natural debris or with the space shuttle, which will ferry 
construction materials, astronauts and propellant fuel to the station. 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of sufficient propellant to stay in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Each scenario is "highly unlikely," NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from any structural damage or mechanical failures, the most likely 
cause of a space station plunge would be that it will run out of propellant, 
causing it to fall out of orbit, said John Pike, associate director for space 
policy at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The space station is supposed to have sufficient fuel to maintain orbit for 180 
days, although current plans call for refueling every 73 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
But given such a large number of shuttle flights during the 30-year lifespan of 
the space station, Pike reasoned, another catastrophe like the 1986 Challenger 
explosion is inevitable -- a calculation based on NASA's own odds of such a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Another Challenger-like disaster, in turn, would lead to a prolonged grounding 
of all shuttles, thus making the refueling of the space station impossible, 
Pike said. He noted that on each of four occasions when the United States or 
the Soviet Union lost astronauts, manned spacecraft were grounded for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Challenger tragedy, the Department of Transportation asked NASA to 
assess the odds of a recurrence, and the space agency came up with a worst-case 
scenario of one explosion in every 78 launches and a best-case scenario of one 
in 200. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those projections, Pike said, "that would put it (the next accident) 
in the early next century." 
</P>
<P>
It would take 28 shuttle flights just to lift into orbit all the components of 
the space station. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple math is going to tell you that -- rather than extremely unlikely, as 
they describe it -- one would be surprisingly lucky if it didn't happen," Pike 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Hess, a NASA space station spokesman, warned against automatically 
assuming that the shuttle fleet would be grounded for extended time periods 
after another accident. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't necessarily follow," Hess said, adding that measures such as 
repositioning the space station or rearranging its solar panels could extend 
its orbital life by up to 200 more days. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, added Doyle McDonald, a NASA spacecraft engineer who directed the 
environmental impact statement, any precise calculations should be deferred 
until the space station's final design and configuration are known.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL APPROVES $1-BILLION PROJECT AT OLD PIKE SITE 
</P>

<P>
An ambitious plan to build a mini-city on the old Pike Amusement Park site 
picked up another important approval this week with the ease of a 
roller-coaster car sliding downhill. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council noted concerns about traffic congestion associated with the 
$1-billion development, expressed confidence that gridlock could be avoided and 
unanimously approved local coastal plan changes so the huge project can move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acted with enthusiasm, heaping praise on a development that is 
bigger and denser than anything ever built in this city of historically 
suburban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments were glowing as they approved changes that would more the double 
the site's maximum density and allow buildings up to 600 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity for this city," Councilwoman Jan C. Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ol' days are about to come back," Councilman Les Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted," Councilman Clarence Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie E. Kell said the project is exciting; Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude called the development a big boost for downtown, and Councilman Jeffrey 
A. Kellogg repeated several times that he is very proud to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-building project of offices, residences, hotels and shops -- one of the 
largest urban coastal developments in the country -- still has several hurdles 
to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Plans must be approved by the California Coastal Commission. Then the city must 
approve a master site plan that spells out details of the development, which is 
be to built over 13 years, beginning in 1990, on acreage near the Hyatt Regency 
hotel and the Long Beach Convention Center, bounded by Shoreline Drive, Seaside 
Way, Pine Avenue and Queens Way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13-Acre Development 
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the possibility of traffic jams associated with the 13-acre 
development, the council seemed assured that city planners and developers would 
devise ways to handle the cars traveling to and from the seaside complex, which 
is expected to employ 8,000 people and generate 27,500 to 36,000 car trips a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ratkovich -- whose Los Angeles company is developing the site in 
conjunction with a West Coast subsidiary of a company owned by developer James 
W. Rouse, who is known nationally for his shoreline developments -- said the 
project's traffic studies indicate that of 12 surrounding intersections, two 
would be pushed to unacceptable levels of congestion by the project. 
</P>
<P>
And those two, Alamitos Avenue and Ocean Boulevard and Alamitos and 7th Street, 
are already backed up at peak commuting hours, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich also emphasized that the nature of the mixed-use project would cut 
down on car use, because people could walk from hotels and residences to shops 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"For Southern California, it is bold and unprecedented," Ratkovich said. "But 
it is a necessary step away from dependency on the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Robert Paternoster pointed out that the developers would 
be required to make traffic improvements, including installing traffic signals, 
upgrading intersections, extending some streets on the site, installing bus 
shelters and drawing up plans to encourage car-pooling and use of mass transit 
by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Firm Hired 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have agreed to whatever transportation-related development 
fees are imposed by the city when the transportation section of the General 
Plan is finished. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Paternoster said, city planners have hired a private 
consulting firm to design a computer model that will allow the city to simulate 
traffic problems associated with Pike and 11 other downtown developments that 
are under way or have been approved. The model will be used to find ways of 
routing the traffic to avoid traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for several organizations that had previously complained to the 
Planning Commission about future traffic nightmares downtown repeated their 
concerns to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the Pike project, city officials should have a much better 
idea of how they are going to handle the thousands of extra cars that the 
complex will draw, argued Marc Coleman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Support Density 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to forecast there may be a solution in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lamond of the Long Beach branch of the Sierra Club also said that while 
the project is in many ways admirable, his group cannot support the increased 
height and density limits, which would spawn a development that would 
contribute to air pollution and traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticized the project for not including housing for low- or 
moderate-income residents. In response, the developers said they want to design 
the 1,000 planned residences for a range of incomes. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, of the $13 million a year the fully completed project is 
expected to generate in sales-tax revenue to the city, $1.8 million a year will 
be set aside for low-cost housing.

   The state Board of Education today voted
to take control of the finances of the debt-ridden Pike County
school system, citing widespread nepotism in Kentucky's
third-largest district.
   The action means that the 15,250-student school system cannot
make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state
school Superintendent John Brock.
   The board acted after receiving a consultants' report detailing
dozens of management problems within the state's easternmost
county, a coal-mining area with 87,000 residents.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   The requirement that Brock approve all personnel actions will
relieve the five-member local board of political pressure to hire
friends and relatives of influential county residents, the state
superintendent said.
   Increased layoffs in the coal industry, the consultants said,
had resulted in greater pressure on local board members to hire
more people in the schools.
   In some schools, two-thirds to three-quarters of employees are
related by blood or marriage.
   The consultants' report said the district would begin a third
straight school year with a deficit budget. The district's debt,
which was about $2,000,000, is now about $500,000.
   The report said the district needs to control spending, close
several schools, reduce non-teaching staff and make an effort to
collect delinquent taxes.
   In May, the New Jersey education commissioner announced the
state intends to take over Jersey City's 32,000-student district,
under fire for a high dropout rate, political hiring and firing and
questionable finances.
   Besides Kentucky and New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas and New
Mexico have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school
districts.
   Laws in Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate deficient
districts. An Ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled
district's charter. Georgia officials may impose heavy financial
penalties on such districts.

<HEAD>Treaty Questions Raised by Planned Anti-Missile Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say a planned Star Wars test in the
South Pacific comes close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Near the middle of the month, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3-ton
infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead
on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
   The plane is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle on
Monday for a two-day trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test
range in the Pacific.
   Anti-ballistic missile radar is prohibited by the 1972 ABM
Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists and a Star Wars critic, said the aircraft ``appears to
be the functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' Pike said.
   The Army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an
anti-missile sensor system. It also argues that the aircraft could
not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.

<HEAD>Administration Reiterates That 1973 Decision Should Be Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new administration broadside aimed at
legalized abortion suggests pro-choice advocates have much to fear
from Supreme Court nominee David Souter, says the executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   In a Supreme Court brief filed Friday, Solicitor General Kenneth
Starr defended Reagan administration regulations that prohibit
government-financed family planning clinics from providing abortion
counseling. The regulations promulgated by the Department of Health
and Human Services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning
clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations.
   The solicitor general said ``we continue to believe'' that Roe
vs. Wade was ``wrongly decided and should be overruled.''
   But he stopped short of asking the justices to do so in pending
cases involving New York City family planning clinics.
   ``This is direct evidence that there is reason to fear Judge
Souter,'' said Kate Michelman of NARAL. ``The administration must
feel confident they will soon have the votes to overturn Roe.''
   The clinics are financed under a $200 million-a-year program
under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act. The law forbids
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was
an option.
   The court is considering two cases from New York City in which
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1988 regulations
on a 2-1 vote. But some other federal appeals courts have ruled the
regulations were unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want to Revive Windfall Profits Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil jolt from the Persian Gulf crisis is
renewing calls in Congress for a windfall profits tax.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., have
announced separate measures to restore the tax, which was repealed
in 1987.
   Kanjorski's measure directs the tax revenue to pay the
government's cost of insuring depositors of failed savings and
loans. He estimated that it would raise $15 billion annually.
   Like Packwood's bill, Kanjorski's measure would impose a tax of
up to 70 percent on excessive profits from oil sales. Packwood gave
no estimate of how much money his measure would raise, but he said
it would be based on the earlier tax.
   Both measures face stiff opposition from representatives of
oil-producing states. They say such a tax discourages exploration
and production at a time when the domestic industry should be
trying to grow.

<P>
As officials eagerly embrace a massive proposal to turn the old Pike Amusement 
Park site into the biggest single development ever built in this city, 
questions are emerging about the dramatic traffic increases that will accompany 
Pike and other planned downtown projects. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about future traffic woes proved the major reservation when the 
Planning Commission recently gave an impressively credentialed development team 
one of several key approvals needed to erect a mini-city by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most heated criticism cast on a development that has attracted 
profuse praise, a member of a citywide citizens' group warned planning 
commissioners last month that they were propelling the city into a traffic 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problems Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"As things currently stand, the foreseeable impact of traffic over the next 10 
years in the downtown area is gridlock," contended Marc Coleman of Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved. "I firmly believe that when the citizens of Long Beach 
understand the blank check that is being given to the Pike project through the 
lack of effective planning, a widespread outcry will develop." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic officials concede downtown developments are being built before 
the city fully knows what new traffic problems they will breed or how to solve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a good handle on the ultimate consequences of all the 
development that has been approved or is in the approval process," Richard 
Backus, the city traffic engineer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that their blueprints for turning Long Beach's sleepy 
downtown into a bustling urban center will bring thousands of additional cars 
to local streets, city officials say they are studying ways of coping with the 
traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a problem, there will be a crisis if we don't do something about 
it now," acknowledged Robert Paternoster, the city's planning and building 
director, who said the city is by no means ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of escalating traffic, the city has hired a consulting firm to 
design a computer model to predict traffic tie-ups associated with new 
development throughout the city and to indicate ways of averting them. City 
planners are also requiring the Pike developers to devise programs encouraging 
car-pooling and use of mass transit by the 8,000 employees eventually expected 
to work in the project's office buildings, shops and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Densest Development 
</P>
<P>
Designed as the densest development in Long Beach, the 13-acre Pike complex of 
mid- and high-rises is characterized by large dimensions. More than 3 million 
square feet of office, residential and commercial space would be constructed in 
11 buildings lining the shore on what is now a largely empty expanse of asphalt 
south of Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built over a 13-year period, represents 22% of the total 
office space planned for downtown, 19% of the hotel space, 8% of the 
residential space and 16% of the retail space. A quarter of downtown's ultimate 
work force would be employed there. 
</P>
<P>
Three garages would contain nearly 6,000 parking spaces. Drivers traveling to 
and from the Pike complex could make as many as 36,000 car trips a day, 
according to the proposal's environmental impact report, which predicted 
significant increases in auto-related air pollution and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Planning Commission by a 6-1 vote on March 30 approved zoning 
and local coastal plan changes that more than double the site's allowable 
density and increase the maximum building height by nearly 200 feet, to 600 
feet. Only Commissioner Elbert Segelhorst voted against the proposal, 
explaining that he liked the project but could not approve it before traffic 
concerns were dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and the state Coastal Commission must still review the 
proposal, a venture of the Ratkovich Co. of Los Angeles and Enterprise 
Development West, a subsidiary of a company established by James Rouse, who is 
known for developing Columbia, Md., and popular waterfront complexes in 
Baltimore and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hart, Pike's project manager, said the environmental report's estimate of 
36,000 car trips a day "is truly a worse case analysis . . . and it is a scary 
number." The estimate exaggerates the amount of traffic that will likely be 
generated by the new community, he said, adding that his planners are trying to 
come up with a more realistic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hart said, such a naked statistic ignores the economic and social 
benefits of creating a new urban hub in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic engineers say a more probable traffic figure for the Pike 
development is 27,500 car trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Pike traffic count, it is only a part of downtown's long-term 
traffic picture. Another 11 developments have been approved or are under way in 
the downtown area, including the World Trade Center, Landmark Square and the 
McDonnell Douglas office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city's Strategic Plan for the year 2000 predicted that if all the 
development plans for the port, downtown and the airport come to fruition, 
traffic leading to those areas would more than double. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what the solutions are," said Planning Commissioner Patricia 
Schauer, who prefaced her vote for the Pike project with complaints that the 
city should have had a transportation plan in place before moving ahead with 
such a massive development scheme. "I don't even know if there are solutions 
that are economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush-Hour Bottlenecks 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Coleman, of Citizens Involved, said, there are rush-hour bottlenecks 
leading to downtown, such as at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and 
Alamitos Avenue, "where I can state from personal observation, that many 
mornings, traffic is backed up . . . for eight-tenths of a mile all the way to 
Cherry Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The city's 2000 plan noted several other congested areas in Long Beach, a 
number of them along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Paternoster, who said he has long advocated a traffic study but could not halt 
development until one is in place, said the computer traffic report should be 
completed in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city gets a clearer idea of Long Beach's emerging traffic scenario, 
Backus said, the door is being left open to require developers to adopt traffic 
control measures once the full impact of their projects is gauged. 
</P>
<P>
While the light-rail system under construction between Los Angeles and Long 
Beach will take autos off Long Beach streets, Backus said, it probably will not 
improve the overall traffic situation in the city because the street-level rail 
line will slow the flow of cars. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-congestion measures thus far asked of the Pike developers -- 
subsidized mass transit passes, ride-sharing programs and the like -- are 
"nothing real innovative," Backus acknowledged, but, he said, such practices 
are not yet in widespread use in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will also be required to install traffic signals and add turn 
lanes on some streets adjacent to the project, which will stretch from Pine 
Avenue to Queensway Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hart mentioned other possibilities as well, such as establishing remote parking 
lots from which downtown employees could be shuttled, and starting some sort of 
a shuttle system along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Hart dismissed complaints that the city has been too slow to plan for the 
anticipated jumps in traffic volume. But the Pike team several months ago 
joined other developers in launching their own study of how best to transport 
workers and visitors along Ocean Boulevard and across the bay to the Queen 
Mary, near which the Disney Co. is considering developing a major resort hotel. 
The developers have even talked of building a privately financed monorail.
