WORLD population growth rates will have to be reduced over the next decade
if economic development is to be sustained and the environment protected,
according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
Human numbers are growing at record rates, with an annual increase of about
97m projected for the next 10 years, says the organisation's State of the
World Population 1992 report.
That would mean 6bn people in 1998, and 10bn in 2050, compared with 5.48bn
this summer. Without 'immediate and determined action' to reduce future
family sizes, world population could reach 12.5bn in 2050, it warns.
UNFPA found that, since 1975, population growth rates have been linked to
per capita income in developing countries - before then, no such connection
had been established.
Countries with slower population growth rates saw annual incomes rise by an
average 1.23 per cent a year in the 1980s compared with a fall of 1.25 per
cent in countries where population grew faster. Lower birth rates also meant
higher savings and investment ratios.
Eliminating extreme poverty, improving health and education, and raising the
status of women are seen as essential steps to encouraging reduced family
sizes.
Such policies should give special attention to Africa and south Asia, which
are responsible for more than half the population increases and which
contain most of the world's very poor, says UNFPA.
The issue of sustainable development is also tackled in the report, which
says record population growth rates are being accompanied by record human
consumption of resources.

populations are ageing: the UN expects the proportion of people aged 65 and
over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to
18.4 per cent by 2025.
The UN warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of
natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. Industralised
countries should also brace themselves for increased migratory pressures.
But it dismisses fears of a global food shortage, pointing out that over the
past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent,
faster than population growth.

STEEP INCREASES in world population could lead to catastrophic environmental
damage and loss of species and natural habitats, according to a study funded
by organisations including the United Nations Population Fund and the World
Wide Fund for Nature.*
It says the UN anticipates world population could level out at 11.5bn by the
end of the next century compared with today's 5.4bn. But upper forecasts put
the figure at 12.5bn by 2050 and 28bn by 2150. The 1990s will be the decade
of fastest population growth in history, with an extra 97m people every
year.
It advocates a massive programme for women, giving them access to family
planning methods, education and health.

The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of
the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday.
The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday,
says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each
woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades
(see accompanying story).
If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low
as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn.
The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people,
as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for
prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a
UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how
countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do
so at all.
Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's
population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily
outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the
report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in
total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman -
they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years
to 61 years, according to the UNFPA.
Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to
shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year
in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per
cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the
UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised
countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025.
The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns
that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put
huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and
clean air.
It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much
voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing
out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has
increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'.
But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been
unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell
by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that
while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable
future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local
shortages'.
Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between
countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries
such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as
well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow.
Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as
surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns.
The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia,
Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are
likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century.
For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to
rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North
America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international
migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year
 -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns
that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to
its numbers'.

If anyone at the Cairo conference on population and development needed to be
reminded that the world's population is growing, a 'clock' in the centre of
the exhibition hall kept ticking, registering more than one birth every
second.
Projections by the United Nations - that the total will nearly double from
5.7bn to 10bn by the middle of the next century - were the only part of the
conference text which was not debated, as 180 countries wrestled to agree on
family planning policy. Yet how reliable are the projections?
It is not just UN initiatives which depend on the figures' accuracy. The
International Development Association, an arm of the World Bank, employs
economic criteria such as per capita income when deciding whether to grant a
country concessional loans.
Joseph Chamie, director of the UN's population division, adds that many
businesses are affected by demographic trends. 'If I were a car manufacturer
I'd be busy now designing cars so that older people could get into them,' he
says, referring to the ageing populations of industrialised countries.
But demographers face formidable obstacles in gathering accurate data on
population size. Governments sometimes distort figures to influence
elections, they say.
Some countries in the Middle East have not always counted births and deaths
among their immigrant worker populations. In some societies 'people don't
know how old they are', says Tom Merrick, senior population adviser for the
World Bank, which runs separate models from those of the UN. In some
regions, age distribution data can be distorted because girls are
categorised according to whether or not they have reached puberty.
However, both Merrick and Chamie argue that the quality of the raw data on
current population size has greatly improved in recent years. According to
Merrick, the estimate of 5.7bn is accurate 'to within tens of millions'.
Past census data from some African countries, in particular Nigeria, have
been unreliable, he says, although Nigeria's 1991 census, which yielded a
lower total than expected, is now regarded by demographers as sound.
Countries with large populations such as China and India have 'pretty good'
censuses, says Merrick.
Because the data are improving, demographers have found the predictive power
of demographic models to be good so far. In 1950 the UN estimated that the
world's population would be 6.3bn in 2000; its latest figures suggest around
6bn. But all acknowledge the difficulties in predicting the future. The
models are sensitive to assumptions about whether family sizes will continue
to fall as they have been doing in most countries for the last 15 years. The
UN projections for 2050 range from 7.8bn to 12.5bn on only tiny variations
in those assumptions.
However, delegates at the conference, which ended this week, advanced many
competing theories about why parents choose to have smaller families. Twenty
years ago, the slogan 'development is the best contraception' was the
favourite theory, but at Cairo demographers emphasised ease of access to
contraception or better education for women.
Moreover, the models cannot take account of future development of new
contraceptive techniques. According to Chamie, 'the Pill made a tremendous
difference on fertility, as did the intra-uterine device and injectible
contraceptives. They separate the act of sex from the decision to use a
contraceptive, unlike condoms for example'.
Demographers' models have spelled out to governments that they have reason
to worry about population growth, and to move fast on improving family
planning services.
The best tribute to the demographers' efforts will be if governments act so
quickly that predictions of the world's population in the next century prove
too high.

RAPID growth in the world's population, most of it among people living in
poverty, poses one of the gravest threats to the environment. 'The result is
overgrazing, deforestation, depletion of water resources and loss of natural
habitat,' says the report.
Over the next 30 to 40 years the world's population could rise by a further
3.7bn people, from its present level of 5.3bn. In most parts of the world
this growth will come among urban dwellers. Only in Africa will more than
half the population still be living off the land.
The report makes the gloomy comment that the earlier goal of reducing the
number of poor in the world between 1985 and 2000 will now not be
achievable. At the end of this century the number of poor is now projected
to exceed 1.1bn people.
The report says four policy aims should be adopted to check these trends:
Incomes of poor households must rise.
Child mortality must decline.
Educational and employment opportunities (especially for women) must expand.
Access to family planning services must be increased.
The report says investment in female education yields some of the highest
returns for development and the environment, as better-educated mothers
raise healthier families and have fewer children.
Family planning also helps. Contraceptive use in developing countries
expanded from 40 per cent to 49 per cent over the last decade. But there is
large, unmet demand for contraceptives and their use must continue to rise
sharply to keep population growth under control.

THE WORLD'S oceans can no longer sustain the demands for fish made on them
by a hungry and growing world population, according to a new report by an
international think tank.
Analysts at the Worldwatch Institute cite decreasing global supplies of fish
as one element in an emerging scarcity of sources of protein. Harvests of
two other important sources of protein - soyabeans and meat - increased
slightly in 1992, but failed to keep up with world population growth.
Global fish catches decreased from 100m tonnes in 1989 to 97m tonnes in 1990
and have remained close to that level. The amount of fish harvested per head
of world population has declined 8 per cent since 1988.
The 1992 soyabean harvest set a world record, yielding nearly 114m tonnes,
but like fish, the output per person has declined. Almost all of the 1992
crop came from the US, Brazil, Argentina and China.
Growth in world meat supplies has fallen below its traditional pace since
1990, which Worldwatch analysts interpret as an indication of the increasing
difficulty of expanding production of grass-eating livestock. Declines in
meat production, concentrated in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and
the European Community, were offset by modest production increases in China
and the US.
News of world grain supplies was relatively brighter as stocks on hand at
the start of the 1993 harvest were up 19m tonnes from 1992 to a level
sufficient to feed the world for 73 days. Analysts noted, however, that
increases in global stocks masked regional decreases such as that in
southern Africa, where drought caused sharply lower maize harvest.
The report also found decreasing world use of fertiliser, largely because of
the removal of subsidies for their purchase in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
The study found capacity to generate power with wind continued to grow in
1992, while nuclear power capacity was at a virtual standstill.
Cigarette smoking held steady from 1991 to 1992 breaking a trend of almost
uninterrupted growth since the end of World War II, the study found.

PRINCE CHARLES warned in London yesterday that environmental improvement and
alleviation of Third World poverty would be jeopardised by the predicted
doubling of the world's population to 10bn by the year 2050.
He said that some delegations to the forthcoming Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro were blocking discussion on the need to reduce the growth in world
population.
The prince did not name the delegations which he said were determined to
prevent discussion of the issue. But they are understood to include the
Vatican, the Philippines and Latin American countries. The UK strongly
favours having the population issue on the agenda of the summit, to be held
in June.
'I don't in all logic see how any society can hope to improve its lot when
population growth regularly exceeds economic growth,' he said.
'We will not protect the environment until we address the issue of
population growth and poverty in the same breath. I wish that these simple
and incontestable truths could find greater prominence on the Rio agenda.'
The prince was addressing a session of the World Commission on Environment
and Development which will issue a statement tomorrow giving its views on
the Earth Summit. The commission was formed in 1984 by the United Nations to
draw up a global environmental agenda.
The prince said that unless a far-sighted agenda for action was worked out
'we will be sacrificing the survival or our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren for short-term gain'.
Negotiations for the summit have been marked by differences between
industrialised and developing countries. But the prince asked why resources
could not be pooled to 'tackle the unfolding crisis together'.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister - who heads the
commission - warned that the summit could fail unless the 'watering down' of
proposals during preparatory talks was reversed by pressure of public
opinion. 'We must enter a period of firm action,' she said.

Worldwide spending on family planning needs to rise to Dollars 17bn by the
end of the decade - more than treble present levels - if the growth in the
world's population is to be curbed, the United Nations population fund said
yesterday.
The UN call comes amid an international row over the agenda of next month's
population conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting to tackle the issue for
a decade.
This week, US anti-abortionists joined the Vatican and Islamic leaders in
attacking the conference's draft agenda, which calls on countries to draw up
plans for stabilising the world's population.
The agenda also covers homosexuality, women's rights and teenage sex, but it
is the comments on abortion that have provoked the fiercest opposition. The
US's powerful anti-abortion lobby took full page advertisements in leading
newspapers this week to accuse the UN and the US of promoting abortion as a
means of contraception.
Governments from the Philippines to the Middle East have been drawn into the
controversy, in which the US and the Vatican have been cast as the prime
antagonists. Pope John Paul II, who has accused the conference of promoting
the 'culture of death', last week attacked the conference's support for
artificial birth control.
Islamic leaders in Cairo, and Iran's Moslem-led government have also
criticised sections of the draft document.
Mr Timothy Wirth, the US undersecretary of state for global affairs, has
insisted that 'neither US policy nor the Cairo document promotes abortion'.
The UN said the agenda commented on abortion only in the context of a threat
to women's health.
The UN population fund, which estimates that 250,000 women die each year
from the 50m abortions performed worldwide, has called for better
distribution of contraceptives to help reduce the number of unwanted
pregnancies. UN officials are exasperated that the abortion row threatens to
distract debate from the broader issues of population growth.
According to the fund's annual report, published yesterday, the world's
present population of 5.7bn is set to rise to 10bn by the middle of the next
century even if the sharp falls in birth rates seen in recent years
continue.
But it argues that the population could be stabilised at 7.8bn if
contraception were made much more widely available.

    Population Symposium To Prepare for UN Forum

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) will discuss problems resulting from the 
growing world population at a symposium from Saturday in 
preparation for a United Nations Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo, Egypt, later this year, organizers said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The symposium, which will be held at Waseda University in 
Tokyo, is co-organized by the "Peoples' Forum 2001," an NGO 
umbrella organization, and "Japan's Network for Women and 
Health," which aims at increasing women's representation at the 
Cairo conference. 
  Panelists will include Makoto Ato, head of the Health and 
Welfare Ministry's Institute of Population Problems, Assistant 
Prof. Chizuko Ueno of Tokyo University and representatives of 
the U.N. Population Fund. 
  The symposium will adopt an appeal urging the Japanese 
Government to include NGO and women representatives in its 
delegation for the Cairo conference. The suggestions will be 
submitted to the government-organized "Tokyo Wise Men's 
Conference on Population and Development," which will be held on 
February 26 and 27. 
  "Population growth in developing countries is a result of 
environment destruction by developed countries. There the 
Japanese bear responsibility too," said Shunsuke Iwasaki, 
assistant professor at Tsukuba University and head of the 
Peoples' Forum 2001. 
  "This problem is not that simple that it could be solved by 
just providing means for birth control. As the Cairo conference 
is drawing closer, we want to make the first step to give 
ordinary people a say (in these matters)," Iwasaki said in 
explaining the objectives of the symposium. 
  The U.N. holds its international Conference on Population 
and 
Development every ten years. This year's conference, from 
September 5 to 13, will adopt an action program seeking to 
establish a sustainable balance between the soaring population, 
scarce resources and an increasingly damaged environment. 
  The U.N. estimates that the world population will grow by a 
record 93 million to over 5.7 billion in 1994, with the majority 
of the growth occurring in developing countries.

attributed to better distribution of contraception, argues the UN. One of
the clearest messages of the report is that people will willingly use
contraception, if it is made available.
The UN's story about the prospects for coming decades is somewhat more
disturbing. The number of people on the planet is likely almost to double,
from the present 5.7bn to some 10bn, by the middle of next century. This
assumes that birth rates continue to fall; other assumptions suggest figures
between 8bn and 12.5bn.
Food supplies
Yet such increases need be no disaster. The UN report rightly rebuts fears
of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the Club of Rome two
decades ago. But uneven distribution of the world's food supplies leaves
people in many regions facing starvation. More even than food, water may
become a cause of conflict. It also warns that pressure on other natural
resources - forests, seas and the atmosphere - will increase.
Yet it is important to recognise that population growth is not the sole
cause of pressure on resources. Nor would even a stable global population
halt it. Economic growth is still more important. That is why the 15 per
cent of the world's population in rich countries consumes so
disproportionate a share of global resources. It is also why calls from this
minority for limits on the numbers of the poor majority look morally
disreputable.
Neither prophecies of doom nor hypocritical bombast are justified. What is
needed, instead, is for developing countries themselves to recognise that
unchecked population growth imposes, at best, a heavy burden of additional
investment upon them. At worst, it threatens their social stability, as
people flood from the countryside to the cities, in search of jobs.
Family planning
These pressing social and economic issues underline the importance of next
month's conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting on population for a
decade. The UN's draft agenda calls for co-ordination of measures to
stabilise the world's population, including a trebling of spending on family
planning programmes, and better education for women.
This is the right policy agenda, because it emphasises helping people help
themselves. This is not just the most ethical, but also the most practical
way to address the issue, since what people want for themselves is also what
their societies need.
Despite the convergence of support for such measures among governments, the
agenda faces opposition. This month the Vatican, which has called on
governments to boycott the conference, accused the UN of promoting abortion.
That charge is ill-founded, given that the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) is barred from portraying abortion as a way to control family size.
It would be both inhumane and imprudent for governments to reject the UN's
draft agenda. That is not to make light of the social and cultural
implications of the policies recommended by the UNFPA. But it is surely
right for women to be given control over the number of children they bear.
Western countries should assist countries that wish to make contraception
available, though not those that resort to coercion. They should also remind
recalcitrant governments that the alternative to contraception is both lower
growth in incomes per head and serious social disruption.

    U.S. To Boost Worldwide Population Control Aid 
  OW0502212294 Beijing XINHUA in English 2050 GMT 5 Feb 94 
 OW0502212294

Language:  English 
Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Washington, February 5 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Government is to increase its financial assistance to the 
worldwide population control, official sources said here today. 
  "If we can't stabilize the world's population, we're not 
going to be able to control any other problems," said State 
Department Counselor Tim Wirth, who is in charge of population 
policy. 
  President Bill Clinton announced last Monday the 1995 U.S. 
Federal Budget will include 585 million U.S. dollars population 
control assistance, up from about 503 million dollars this year, 
press reports here said. 
  The U.S. is also teaming up with Japan to boost aid for 
population stabilization programs in poor countries. 
  When Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits 
Washington later next week, he and Clinton will announce an 
accord on population assistance. Japan is expected to commit 3 
billion dollars by the end of the decade for population programs 
and combating AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in 
developing countries, an AP report quoted U.S. Government 
officials as saying. 
  Population experts project today's world population of 5.5 
billion will grow by 1 billion over the next decade, and double 
to 11 billion in 40 years. 
  By the year 2050, it will reach 12 billion, with more than 
90 
percent of the growth occurring in developing nations. 
  The present U.S. population of 259 million, growing at a 
slower rate, is projected to reach 392 million by the year 2050. 
  The Clinton administration has decided that stabilizing 
population is crucial to alleviating poverty and hunger. 
  The 1995 U.S. Federal Budget of around 1.5 trillion dollars 
will boost U.S. assistance to the U.N. Population Fund - which 
was cut off during the Reagan and Bush administrations - from 
the current 40 million dollars to 60 million dollars a year. 
  Wirth said that he hopes the U.S. population assistance to 
the U.N. Population Fund to top 1 billion dollars by the end of 
the decade. The goal is to ensure that every woman who wants 
family planning assistance can get it.

THE WORLD'S population is growing at an unprecedented rate, consuming more
resources than ever - nearly a billion people will be added to the planet
during the 1990s, according to the Worldwatch Institute. As the number of
poor people is increasing, human migration is growing and renewable
resources, such as water and land are increasingly under threat.
Such realities make the population issue a crucial one for sustainable
development. There are about 5.5bn people in the world, with an average
annual increase of 97m projected for the coming decade. International
experts agree that population growth rates will have to be reduced, and the
pattern of human activities changed, if ecological catastrophe is to be
averted.
The two go hand-in-hand because it is not simply high population growth
rates that are threatening the environment. Developed countries, with
relatively low birth rates, consume most of the world's resources. A
Bangladeshi, for example, consumes energy equivalent to three barrels of oil
a year, a US citizen 55 barrels.
As Oxfam puts it: 'Industrialised countries generate significantly more
damage per person to the global environment than do people in developing
countries.'
Sustainable development therefore calls for a fairer distribution of the
benefits of development among the world's people.
High population growth rates in developing countries - where 80 per cent of
the world's population lives - will, nevertheless, put even greater pressure
on the world's resources.
The higher the population in developing countries, the higher their energy
use and pollution, especially as economies develop. More water is needed,
more forests are cleared, inappropriate agricultural practices increase and
wildlife species disappear. Population growth in developing countries is
responsible for about 79 per cent of deforestation, 72 per cent of arable
land expansion and 69 per cent of the growth in livestock numbers.
Such problems are further compounded by the increasing migration of people -
to urban areas and to environmentally sensitive inland areas - in search of
productive land and jobs.
Addressing high birth rates means addressing poverty in such countries, say
international agencies. More than 1bn people live in absolute poverty
without adequate food, clothing or housing.
North-South relationships regarding debt, trade, aid and technology transfer
are seen as longer-term means of tackling poverty. Programmes to tackle high
birth rates focus on improving third world health and education, and
providing readily available and affordable family planning.
Practice shows that birth rates can be reduced voluntarily by raising the
status of women through education and providing them with opportunities
other than the traditional child bearing role. It is thought that more than
one in five births in developing countries may be unwanted.
The worst case scenario for the population explosion is that there could be
12.5bn people in the world by 2050 if immediate action is not taken. The
most likely scenario is a figure of 10bn people.
Fertility patterns can change in just one decade. Development and
consumption patterns will have to follow suit, says the United Nations
Population Fund.
'World resources are adequate for the sustained development of the planet -
if they are carefully used,' it warns.

LINKING AID TO POPULATION GROWTH 




Rep. Anthony Beilenson's (D-Los Angeles) article on foreign aid and population 
growth (Commentary, July 23) was excellent. Mankind's slow response to the 
ever-more-serious growth of our population is leading us to disaster. 


The U.S. government must do more to assist anyone in the world who wants access 
to family planning. The dehumanizing poverty and declining standard of living 
for hundreds of millions of people in less-developed countries are reasons 
enough to do so. 


But help must be given for our own sake as well. The Dominican and Mexican 
population explosions illustrate why. The United States has been flooded with 
millions of poor, uneducated Dominicans and Mexicans, who have fled their 
countries and who now contribute to the overcrowding of our cities, 
particularly New York and Los Angeles. 


The Third World population explosion is everybody's problem. We must insist 
that our government take a more active role to solve it.

Alarm and hope: those are governments' twin reactions to the latest batch of
projections from the United Nations on how many people will be occupying the
planet in the next century. One message behind the figures is that high
population growth in developing countries remains a threat to their
prosperity, and through migration, to that of developed countries as well.
But other messages are that growing populations need not represent the
apocalypse which has been predicted by many, and that there is much
governments can do to slow down the increase.
This month's UN conference on population and development in Cairo, the first
to tackle the contentious subject for a decade, stirred up controversy on
many fronts. The Vatican formally registered its reservations to nearly half
the chapters in the final text, on the grounds that it condoned abortion as
a form of contraception. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which organised the
conference, denied that the text had that interpretation, but several
Catholic countries in Latin America also lodged reservations to sections.
However, despite an informal alliance between the Vatican and Moslem
governments in the run-up to Cairo, governments achieved a much greater
degree of agreement at Cairo on responses to the threat of population growth
than seemed possible at the previous UN conferences in 1984 or 1974. The
final document set a target for annual spending on family planning of
Dollars 17bn a year by 2000, from national programmes and international aid,
which marks a threefold increase on present levels.
Most governments acknowledged at Cairo that it is in their own interest to
take steps to help people limit the sizes of their families, given the
formidable projections of the world's population. According to the UNFPA's
annual report, published in August, the total is set to reach a sobering
10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn at present.
The UNFPA's projection assumes that the average number of children born to
each woman will continue to fall, as it has done for several decades; other
assumptions, only slightly different, produce estimates of the total number
of people in 2050 between 7.8bn and 12.5bn.
These increases will put increasing strains on natural resources of all
kinds, both global resources, such as the atmosphere and seas, and regional.
Water, in particular, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between
countries and regions, the UNFPA suggests.
The implications of these projections for the distribution of wealth between
countries and continents are also considerable. The World Bank estimates, in
a report released ahead of Cairo, that 61 per cent of the world's population
will live in countries with per capita incomes of below Dollars 350 a year
(in 1990 money values). That compares with 57 per cent in 1985. Over the
same period, the proportion of people living in countries with per capita
incomes over Dollars 19,590 will fall from 16 per cent to 11 per cent.
Moreover, the bank warns that by 2100, 10 out of 11 people will live in the
developing world, compared to four out of five at present, and two out of
three in 1950. Much of the increase will come in Africa: the present annual
growth in the continent's population of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest
in the world. That rate outstrips by some way the annual Asian and Latin
American growth of less than 2 per cent, according to the UNFPA.
Within developing countries, people will drift to the cities in search of
jobs, prompted by competition for land and water in rural areas. The World
Bank estimates that in 2025, 57 per cent of the population in developing
countries will live in cities, compared to less than half now.
As a result of those pressures, developed countries should prepare to face
growing pressures for immigration, the bank warns. As their populations are
growing slowly, they should expect their share of the world's population to
shrink. While North America's population is edging up at 1 per cent a year,
the rate is only 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per
cent a year in western Europe.
Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of
people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present
12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025.
To set against those threats, UN figures provide some ammunition to counter
fears of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the 'Club of Rome'
school of forecasters some 20 years ago. The UNFPA observes that 'during the
past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent,
outpacing the rate of population growth'.
But the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed, the
UNFPA also points out. In Africa, food production fell by 5 per cent while
population rose by a third. While the UN maintains that food supplies
'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future', the
poorer regions and countries will face severe shortages.
Reason to worry, then; but the past two decades also provide grounds for
hope that governments can help bring down population growth rates. Most
developing countries - even, in the past few years, those in sub-Saharan
Africa - have seen fertility rates fall.
According to UNFPA officials, a decade ago many African countries saw
growing populations as a useful tool to increase prosperity. Now, seeing the
growth jeopardise the fruits of investment in health, education,
infrastructure and agriculture, they are showing a greater readiness to
promote family planning.
The UNFPA says that governments now appreciate that making contraception
more widely available helps bring down fertility rates, even if economic
development has been slow. Demographers' new message is that if people are
given the means to control the number of children they have, even in the
poorest countries they frequently choose to have fewer.
The past decade has shown governments the threat which uncurbed population
growth can pose to prosperity. But it has also helped generate confidence
among governments that growth rates can be tackled, and broad agreement on
ways to do that.

I HAD another lesson this week with Jasper Strong, my 6ft 5in,
sportscar-driving, blond-locked tennis coach. For two hours we worked on my
back-court shots, the drives, the lobs and half-volleys. 'Remember,' said
Jasper, 'the lob is a lifting shot. Try to concentrate. Your mind should be
blank.'
I once asked Jasper why he persists with me. All his other clients are rich
and wistful women who live in Daisyworld: the area off London's Kensington
Church Street. 'Well,' said Jasper. 'You are the only media whinger that I
know. You have an interesting mind. Pitiful, but interesting.' He is 23,
with a degree in sports studies.
As soon as the lesson was over, Jasper interrogated me about my remarks last
week on unchecked population growth - specifically, my belief that the
planet is hurtling towards a catastrophe caused by manic pollution and
over-consumption.
'Priscilla Humpington-Kooning says you're wrong,' said Jasper. 'She says you
are a pessimist and a cynic.' Mrs Humpington-Kooning is one of his
Kensington clients: beautiful and silly-rich.
'Priscilla says that from now on there will be progress in education,
health, family planning and improvement of women's status to counteract
population growth, and that technological prowess will help us master
planetry degradation. She looked up some figures for me. Priscilla says that
if the overall fertility rate stabilises at below two children per woman,
world population will fall quite rapidly, perhaps to 5bn-6bn again by 2150.
At a rate of 1.7, world population in 2150 would be the same as in 1978,
about 4.3bn. Priscilla says optimism on this score is not far-fetched.
Europe's current average fertility rate is 1.7. Eleven developed countries
are already below it.'
'Sure, Jasper,' I said. 'That is the view from Daisyworld. But I am a
Cassandra, a neo-Malthusian. It is equally possible that world population
will shoot to 20bn-30bn. Last week I mentioned Paul Harrison and his book,
The Third Revolution. Everyone should read it. Referring to a population of
20bn-30bn, Harrison says: 'Assuming such numbers were sustainable, life
could come to resemble the prophetic film Soylent Green, where meat and soap
are exquisite rarities; nature is glimpsed only in videos played to
euthanasia volunteers . . . and human corpses are recycled as high-protein
biscuits.'
'Take water, Jasper. I know that when you visit Priscilla, she runs Perrier
through the Jacuzzi for you as a prelude to rumpy-pumpy. There is not an
obvious scarcity of water in Daisyworld. But its supply is finite. The
global annual run-off from rainfall is 41,000 square kilometres. Of that,
perhaps 9,000 sq km are available for human use. Of that, we already use
more than a third. There will be wars over water. Even then, we are not
facing a resource crisis but a pollution crisis. At the end of his lifetime
the average European leaves a monument of waste almost 1,000 times his
bodyweight. North Americans leave a waste mausoleum 3,900 times their
bodyweight.'
'So what are your solutions to population growth?'
I said: 'All the usual: education, contraception, immense advances in
women's status. But for Cassandras like me, more will be needed. We disagree
with the idea that compulsion over family size has no role to play - that it
violates human rights and is only possible in non-democratic societies.
India and China are the only two countries to have tried it on a large scale
so far. In India, family planning was said to have been set back a decade by
Indira Gandhi's coercive vasectomy programme.
'However, I believe that such schemes will become the norm. I see nothing
wrong with tax bonuses for childlessness or even the odd spot of castration
for recidivist or overly gung-ho males.'
Jasper had turned chalk-white. 'I thought you were supposed to be a
liberal,' he whined.
'I am a liberal, Jasper - but a liberal from the middle of the 21st century.
You should see what right-wingers will be like in 2050.'
Jasper was stricken. But then he brightened. 'I'll see you next week,' he
said. 'What you need most is some extremely serious gym work. I will draw up
a programme. Meantime, get your hair cut.'

DESPITE RADICALS' GRUMBLINGS, IRAN INTENSIFIES BIRTH-CONTROL PROGRAM; 


POPULATION: WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST BIRTH RATES IN THE WORLD, FEARS GROW THAT 
THE COUNTRY COULD FACE A MAJOR SOCIAL EXPLOSION. 




By ED BLANCHE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




NICOSIA, Cyprus 




Iran's government is intensifying a birth-control program -- despite opposition 
from radicals -- because the country's fast-growing population is imposing 
strains on a struggling economy. 


"If the Islamic Republic's government does not implement proper and swift plans 
for controlling population growth in Iran, future generations will definitely 
face severe social and economic problems," Tehran's Kayhan International 
newspaper warned recently. 


"Can we be proud of a nation of hungry Muslims who have to beg the infidels of 
the world for charity?" declared Mohammed Yazdi, a member of the 12-member 
Council of Guardians, a legislative watchdog body. 


Iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world, between 3.5% and 4% a 
year. Even in the Middle East, where soaring populations are the norm, Iran's 
baby boom is fast outstripping development. 


Before the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran had about 35 million people. Last 
month, the government's chief statistician, Majid Shamshidi, said the 
population had reached 55 million. 


Experts estimate that by the year 2010, Iran will have 140 million people. They 
warn that unless something is done soon to curb the birth rate and rapidly 
expand the economy, the country faces a major social explosion. 


While Iran struggles to cope with its baby boom, rival Iraq is striving to 
expand its population to keep up with the Iranians should the Iran-Iraq War, 
halted by an August, 1988, cease-fire, flare up again. 


Iraq has about 16 million people, and President Saddam Hussein has declared 
that increasing its birth rate a "strategic duty." He offers hefty financial 
incentives, including cash grants and interest-free home-purchase loans. 


Iran launched a half-hearted birth-control campaign last year, with some 
religious leaders encouraging Iran's predominantly Muslim population to have 
fewer children. Now Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has 
declared that birth control is not un-Islamic, although abortion is illegal. 


The Health Ministry announced it has set up centers in major cities to provide 
free contraceptives. But the contraceptives reportedly are in short supply. 


Some newspapers say that unless more is done to get the message across, the 
government program will have little impact on Iranians, who have traditionally 
favored large families. 


The English-language Tehran Times called in December for a media campaign to 
warn Iranians of the danger of unrestrained population growth "to bring this 
immense problem . . . under control." 


Kayhan International declared: "This phenomenon should be seriously and 
properly dealt with. Using economic incentives, the government should encourage 
Iranian couples to have only two children." 


One of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's most important priorities is expanding 
the economy to at least five times its current size to accommodate the expected 
population growth. 


As it is, Western economists believe the economy, plagued by bad management 
during the revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq, is already severely 
stretched and needs massive investment just to cope with the current crisis. 


Rafsanjani's rivals oppose birth control. They believe that the larger Iran's 
population, the greater its chances of becoming the undisputed leader of the 
Muslim world. 


By the year 2020, demographers estimate that the Muslim population will be 2.5 
billion, double the present total and more than one-quarter of the projected 
world population in the first quarter of the next century. 


The Third World, which would account for more than 80% of the projected world 
population by then, would provide fertile ground for the Islamic revolution, 
the hard-liners argue. 


When a 1986 census showed that 11 million Iranians had been born since the 
revolution, then-Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi publicly rejoiced that they 
had been reared to the credo of "Death to America!" and "Allahu akbar!" or "God 
is great!" 


The radical daily Jomhuri Islami noted recently amid a broadside of press 
criticism of birth control: "The problem is not the increasing population, but 
the lack of policy and planning, and in the end it is the unfortunate 
population that gets the blame." 


Rafsanjani's postwar development plan calls for building 12 industrial cities 
in five years to help absorb the swelling population. 


Tehran's population has swollen to an estimated 8 million in recent years amid 
a widespread drift from the countryside to urban areas. Officials say the city 
is bursting at the seams, with housing, water and electricity shortages, 
traffic-clogged streets and worsening pollution. 


Oil-rich Iran was able to feed itself 10 years ago, but now has to import $2 
billion worth of food a year. 


Agricultural output has slumped severely. In 1979, one-third of the population 
worked in that sector. Now, government figures show that it is only one-fifth.
