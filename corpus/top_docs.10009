SCULPTOR IS HONESTLY ABE'S BIGGEST FAN 




By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Fifty years may seem like a long time for a brain surgeon to toil over one 
head. But not to Dr. Emil Seletz. 


That's how long the veteran Los Angeles neurosurgeon has been carving the 
cranium of one of the most celebrated Americans -- Abraham Lincoln. 


Seletz is a self-taught sculptor whose lifelong goal has been to create 
detailed bronze busts of Lincoln. Today he plans to mark the anniversary of the 
16th President's birth in 1809 by working on his grandest Lincoln head yet. It 
is a four-foot replica that he hopes to place in Ford's Theatre in Washington. 


Seletz, who retired from medical practice three months ago, will also celebrate 
his own birthday today. He plans to spend part of it working in his back-yard 
studio surrounded by 40 other busts of Lincoln he has shaped over the years. 


Declining to give his exact age, Seletz said with a grin, "I'm past 75." 


The short, courtly Seletz picked up his first glob of modeling clay after he 
spied a bust of Lincoln in the Capitol rotunda during a visit to Washington. He 
was a 23-year-old Philadelphia medical student at the time. 


His eyes sparkle as he remembers being left breathless by the beauty of artist 
Gutzon Borglum's work. 


"It simply enthralled me. It excited me beyond my ability to express it," 
recalls Seletz. "That head was remarkable. I ran back every holiday to take a 
look at it." 


When he could not find a copy of the Lincoln bust to purchase, he set out to 
shape one with his own hands. 


After finishing medical school and settling in Los Angeles, Seletz created one 
Lincoln head after another. There was Lincoln in Illinois in 1858. Lincoln the 
lawyer. Lincoln in 1860. Lincoln in 1861. Lincoln the President in 1863. A 
tired Lincoln shortly before his assassination in 1865 at Ford's Theatre. 


Contemporaries of Lincoln described him as homely, even ugly. Seletz disagrees. 


"He has the most beautiful face I've ever seen," he said. "More beautiful than 
any woman." 


Seletz said he has always sought to capture Lincoln's weary compassion in his 
busts, some of which have taken seven years to complete. 


Between Lincolns, Seletz has done other busts, including studies of medical 
figures and family members, as well as such personalities as Albert Einstein, 
Ludwig van Beethoven and Charles Dickens. 


He always returned to Honest Abe, however. 


"I guess I'm a little berserk on the subject," he said, pointing at Lincoln 
heads that have spilled out of his studio and onto a covered patio behind his 
Los Feliz home. "I'm obsessed." 


Said his wife of 40 years, Sylvia: "I've learned to live with them." 


Although some of his other busts have been placed in schools and at Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn. offices, only two of Seletz's Lincolns are on official 
public display. One is at a courthouse in San Jose. The other is at the Los 
Angeles County Hall of Administration.

20 WREATHS PLACED AT LINCOLN'S TOMB 




By United Press International 




SPRINGFIELD, Ill. 




About 200 people watched as veterans and state leaders laid 20 wreaths Monday 
at Abraham Lincoln's tomb in an annual pilgrimage to mark the 181st anniversary 
of his birth. 


Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented a wreath 
from President Bush made of red, white and blue carnations. Both compared 
Lincoln's desire for freedom to the democratic movements in Eastern Europe and 
the release from prison of black activist Nelson R. Mandela in South Africa. 


Lincoln owned his only home in Springfield and lived in that downtown residence 
from 1844-60 while he practiced law and served in the Illinois General 
Assembly.

RIEGLE ACKNOWLEDGES CLOSER CONNECTION TO LINCOLN S&amp;L 




From United Press International 




WASHINGTON 




Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), who has sought to minimize his ties to the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, has acknowledged a deeper involvement with 
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 


Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and four other senators are 
the subject of preliminary reviews by the Senate Ethics Committee and the FBI 
because of their connections to Keating and their actions on his behalf. 


Riegle was one of five senators who intervened with regulators on Keating's 
behalf at an April 9, 1987, meeting about Irvine-based Lincoln. 


That meeting, and a meeting a week earlier that Riegle did not attend, have 
become important to a congressional probe of Lincoln's collapse. Their 
intervention has been blamed by some for the delay in taking regulatory action 
against Lincoln, which was seized in April amid charges of fraud and misuse of 
depositor money. 


The Michigan Democrat has insisted that he attended the April 9 meeting about 
Irvine-based Lincoln only at the request of Senate colleagues who sought his 
presence as "a banking resource person." Riegle has contended that he was 
basically a bystander at the meeting. 


But Karolyn Wallace, Riegle's press secretary, disclosed Tuesday that nearly a 
month earlier, Riegle toured the firm's parent company in Phoenix. Two weeks 
later, on March 23, 1987, Keating sponsored a Detroit fund-raising luncheon for 
Riegle, she said. 


Executives of Lincoln and its parent firm, Phoenix-based American Continental 
Corp., gave Riegle $78,250 in campaign donations at the fund-raiser. 


Riegle returned Keating's donations after it was disclosed by the Detroit News 
last year, saying he wanted to avoid "an appearance of a conflict of interest." 


The previously undisclosed meeting between Riegle and Keating plus other recent 
revelations show that Riegle's relationship with Keating were closer than 
Riegle has publicly indicated. 


In addition to the newly revealed Arizona visit, Riegle did not advise the 
ethics committee of two other Lincoln-related contacts in the weeks before the 
April, 1987, meeting with regulators. 


The other senators under scrutiny for their involvement in the Lincoln case are 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and 
John Glenn (D-Ohio).

Avoid It: Lady Bird Johnson said that some of the things written about her 
husband would make her angry if she read them, so "the simplest thing is not to 
read them." She was responding Tuesday to the furor over Robert Caro's "Means 
of Ascent." 


The book has been sharply criticized by some as being unduly harsh. The former 
first lady was in Washington for a reunion of Johnson Administration officials. 


Arrested: Steve Gobie, the former paid lover of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), 
was arrested in Washington on charges of marijuana possession and destruction 
of property, police said Thursday. The charges stemmed from an incident 
Wednesday in which Gobie confronted an off-duty female police officer who was 
driving her personal car. The officer said Gobie was driving erratically and 
later jumped on the roof of her car. Frank admitted that he in the past paid 
Gobie for sexual favors. 


Grave Dispute: According to historical letters released Wednesday in 
Springfield, Ill., Abraham Lincoln was almost buried in Washington, D.C. rather 
than Illinois. Mary Todd Lincoln was prepared to move the President's remains 
to the nation's capital if Gov. Richard Oglesby insisted on the President being 
interred several miles from Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, where Lincoln is 
in fact buried. "They began to build a vault . . . before Mrs. Lincoln finally 
convinced them Oak Ridge was the place where she wanted the body to be," said a 
spokesman for the state's historical agency. 


By Degrees: George Bush will give the commencement addresses at television 
evangelist Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., this spring, 
Bush press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday. It marks the first visit 
to the school by a sitting President. Compiled by YEMI TOURE

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL REGIONALS; 


BOYS' DIVISION III; 


LINCOLN RUNS INTO A BUZZ SAW AND FALLS, 81-67, TO MORNINGSIDE 




By CHRIS ELLO 




SAN DIEGO 




The Lincoln Hornets, who play in a gymnasium called The Hive and win games 
because their pressing defense never stops buzzing around the basketball, lost 
their sting for just a moment Tuesday night. 


It was the beginning of the third quarter of Lincoln's Southern California 
Regional Division III first-round boys' basketball game against Inglewood 
Morningside. In just 1 minute 23 seconds, Lincoln's one-point halftime lead 
turned into a seven-point deficit, and for the No. 1-seeded Hornets, things 
eventually got stickier. 


Morningside, seeded No. 7, went on to post an 81-67 upset at Lincoln. 


Afterwards, Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski spent a few moments talking about the 
lost moment -- the one that saw Lincoln sleepwalk out of the dressing room and 
get undressed by an 8-0 Morningside run that would never be overcome. 


"I take full responsibility," Loneski said. "It's a coach's job to get his team 
ready to play. But when we came out for the second half, we weren't ready. I 
may never know why, but I know that this won't stop bothering me for a long 
time." 


For almost a year now, Lincoln (27-2) had been dreaming of a possible return to 
Oakland, where it lost the State Division III championship game last March. 
Morningside (24-5) put an end to those ideas quickly, however, after trailing, 
33-32, at the intermission. 


Donald Sanders, a quick point guard who struggled against Lincoln's vaunted 
press in the first half, sliced through Lincoln's complex coverages to start 
the third quarter and twice found center Jeff Crowe for easy layups. 


Then Ken Jones, another slicing guard, stole a pass at half court and raced in 
for a layin to make it, 38-33. The short but telling run ended when Crowe, who 
led Morningside with 17 points, rebounded his own missed shot and scored for a 
40-33 Morningside advantage with 6:37 left. 


Joe Temple, who shot over Morningside's trapping zone defenses most of the 
night and finished with a game-high 32 points, kept Lincoln in the hunt after 
that, but a Lincoln run really never materialized. 


"Once we figured out their press, we were off and running," said Jones, who 
like his team, started slowly but came back to score all of his 14 points in 
the second half. "They gave us some trouble for a while, that's for sure." 


But Morningside dealt with the trouble. Especially after Temple threw down a 
slam and sent the crowd into a frenzy by giving Lincoln an early 5-0 lead. 


"They're going to have trouble with out press tonight," Loneski said aloud. 


Not in the second half, they didn't. Lincoln's defense wasn't moving as 
quickly, and Morningside, which was deep enough to have nine players score, 
didn't wear down. 


The Morningside lead grew to 53-40 late in the third quarter and 69-52 midway 
through the fourth. 


By that time, no sting would have been strong enough.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 


SMITH ASKS FOE TO TELL EXTENT OF HIS TIES TO S&amp;LS 




By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Standing outside a Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan branch office in West Los 
Angeles, Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith demanded 
Thursday that his Republican foe, former Rep. Dan Lungren, explain the extent 
of his ties to figures involved in the massive national S&amp;L scandal. 


"How can you (Lungren) be trusted to oversee the criminal investigation of the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan targets when those very targets are your political 
patrons?" asked the San Francisco district attorney at the afternoon press 
conference. 


Smith's statements came on the heels of the disclosure this week of a 1986 
letter addressed to the nation's top thrift regulator requesting secret records 
concerning controversial investment practices by S&amp;Ls. The letter was 
signed by 16 Republican congressmen, including Lungren. Edwin Gray, former 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman, said in interviews this week that the 
letter appeared to have been a poorly disguised attempt to pass confidential 
information to the Orange County-based Lincoln thrift about possible federal 
actions to tighten controls over it. 


Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. is awaiting trial on securities fraud 
charges in connection with the sale of junk bonds through the now-bankrupt 
institution, whose failure could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 


Gray said Thursday that he believed that Rep. Charles Pashayan (R-Fresno) 
prepared the letter and then asked other congressmen, including Lungren, Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and now-Secretary 
of Defense Dick Cheney, to sign it. 


These other congressmen, he said, "allowed themselves to be duped and used by 
people like Charlie Keating." 


"If there's one thing people ought to learn back (in Washington), it's that 
they should know what they sign and who they do favors for and look twice at 
what they're doing." 


In his press conference, Smith also criticized Lungren for taking campaign 
contributions from Lincoln's lawyers, who are now under investigation, as well 
as a $500 contribution from Lincoln's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. 


The American Continental contribution was made to Lungren's litigation fund in 
1988 after the state Senate rejected his selection to the post of state 
treasurer by Gov. George Deukmejian after the death of Jesse Unruh. At the 
time, Lungren was unsuccessfully seeking to persuade the State Supreme Court to 
overturn the Senate's vote. 


Lungren's current campaign has received the maximum personal contribution of 
$2,000 from GOP fund-raiser Karl M. Samuelian and another $1,350 from former 
state commissioner of corporations Franklin Tom. The two attorneys are partners 
in the Los Angeles law firm Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, 
which recently agreed to pay up to $14.3 million to settle class-action 
lawsuits filed against it by 22,000 individuals who bought junk bonds, now 
worthless, from Lincoln Savings. 


Tom and Samuelian are both under investigation by the Sacramento County 
district attorney's office in a state probe of the Lincoln Savings scandal, 
according to Albert Locher, Sacramento County's chief deputy district attorney. 


"California deserves an attorney general who has the integrity and the guts to 
take on the savings and loans and the other special interests," said Smith at 
his press conference. "Not an attorney general who will do their bidding." 


Lungren, in a telephone interview, said Thursday that he didn't even remember 
signing the letter to Gray, but assumed he may have done so at Pashayan's 
request. 


"We must have been on the (House) floor for some other purpose," said Lungren, 
"and Chip (Pashayan) was going around to California (congressmen) saying he 
needed help." 


Lungren pointed out that the letter contained no red flags since it did not 
specifically mention Lincoln Savings. 


Lungren also said he was not aware of the American Continental contribution to 
his 1988 legal fund until it was pointed out to him Thursday. 


He added that he saw no problem accepting contributions from Samuelian or Tom. 
Nor does he see a problem in having had Samuelian serve as a co-chairman of a 
$250-a-plate Lungren fund-raiser at the Bonaventure Hotel earlier this month. 


"I feel they have the presumption of innocence. They have the same presumption 
of innocence as anyone else does," Lungren said. "I don't see anything 
ethically wrong. Karl Samuelian never asked anything of me. Karl Samuelian has 
given a lot of time to our party on the state level and on the national level. 
He's given a lot of his time to Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George 
Deukmejian."

BRIEFLY 




Regulator Says Lincoln Laundered Funds: Lincoln Savings and Loan allegedly 
laundered illegal political contributions through its president and other 
employees, a state regulator said. Ray Fidel, former president and chief 
executive of Lincoln, received an inflated salary so that he could contribute 
money in his name and reimburse employees who were ordered to contribute, said 
William Crawford, director of the California Department of Savings and Loan. 
Crawford's comments were reported by the Daily News. According to Crawford, 
"The policy was to inflate salaries. He'd get a phone call and someone would 
say: 'You write a check.' " Crawford said the calls came from subordinates of 
Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp., the Phoenix, 
Ariz.-based parent of Lincoln. American Continental filed for protection under 
Chapter 11 law on April 13. One day later, Lincoln was taken over by federal 
regulators.

NOT MUCH CHEER AT LINCOLN'S $80,000 COOKIE PARTY 




By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




HUNTINGTON BEACH 




Two full, steaming pots of cider sat on portable burners, and plates of cookies 
near the teller windows appeared to be untouched. 


Sofas and chairs were arranged around coffee tables and amid desks where 
lenders once sat, giving a homey, close-knit feeling in an office entirely too 
big for the traffic coming through the door. 


To celebrate the Christmas season, the insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan is 
spending an estimated $80,000 to advertise its offering of free cookies and 
cider to customers at all 29 branches. But holiday cheer wasn't infectious at 
this Huntington Beach branch. For half an hour during lunchtime Tuesday, no one 
came to sample the cider, much less put any money in their accounts. 


"We get some customers in the morning and again from 2 to 4 in the afternoon," 
said one of the three branch employees. "But most of our money comes in through 
large CDs . . . and we can't make any loans." 


Irvine-based Lincoln was seized by the government in April, and regulators will 
not allow the S&amp;L to make loans. 


Lincoln's holiday treat for customers isn't unusual for S&amp;Ls. Many thrifts 
provide free goodies to customers during holiday seasons. 


But unlike Lincoln, they are not destined to become the biggest industry 
disaster. Taxpayers could be hit with a $2-billion bill to clean up the 
S&amp;L, which regulators seized in April. 


More importantly, critics say, Lincoln has lost more than $875 million in the 
first nine months this year and shouldn't be paying the estimated $80,000 in 
newspaper advertisements to invite their customers in for cookies and cider. 


Regulatory officials in Washington thought that advertising the S&amp;L's 
season's greetings was appropriate, though a bit extravagant. 


"I think Lincoln's marketing department got a little carried away with the size 
of the ads," said Caryl Austrian, a spokeswoman for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 


The S&amp;L's good cheer wasn't wasted, though, said Mark Randall, a regulatory 
executive managing Lincoln. Other offices in the Lincoln network generally see 
a "considerable number of customers," he said.

READ HIS LIPS: HE'S THINKING ANEW 




From a Times Staff Writer 




WASHINGTON 




President Bush said Friday that he has a lot in common with Abraham Lincoln -- 
but there are some important differences, as well. 


When asked at a press conference how he could justify having reversed his 
pledge of "no new taxes," Bush shot back: "I'm doing like Lincoln did -- 'think 
anew.' 


" 


His reference was to a passage from the Great Emancipator's second annual 
message to Congress in 1862: "The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and 
we must rise with the occasion," Lincoln said. "As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country." 


Like Lincoln, Bush has been plagued with an ever-growing federal budget 
deficit. In the Lincoln era, the government's red ink rose from $25 million in 
fiscal 1861 to $964 million in fiscal 1865. During the years that Bush has been 
either vice president or President, the deficit has soared -- from $78.9 
billion in fiscal 1981 to $152.1 billion in fiscal 1989. And it is climbing 
again. 


But there are also some differences: Lincoln's mushrooming deficit stemmed from 
expenses incurred in fighting the Civil War, while Bush is enjoying 
unprecedented peace worldwide. 


And "Honest Abe" never pledged that he would not raise taxes.

KEATING TELLS TV AUDIENCE TO BLAME REGULATORS, CONGRESS FOR LINCOLN'S FALL; 


THRIFTS: IRVINE-BASED S&amp;L'S OWNER SAYS, 'WE HAD $700 MILLION EXCESS ASSETS 
OVER LIABILITIES IN OUR SUBSIDIARY' BEFORE 'CONNIVING' RUINED HIM. 




From Reuters 




WASHINGTON 




Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. owner Charles Keating said Friday that the 
"conniving" of federal regulators and the guilt of Congress are to blame for 
the multibillion-dollar failure of his Irvine-based thrift. 


Keating said Lincoln showed a profit until it was taken over by federal 
regulators. "We had $700 million excess assets over liabilities in our 
subsidiary," he said on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" program. 


Regulators say the failed savings and loan is expected to cost taxpayers a 
record $2.5 billion. 


"The numbers they come by are numbers that are arbitrarily written down," 
Keating said of what he called the "conniving" regulators. 


"It's a ridiculous situation," he said, "and it's causing a loss unprecedented 
in the history of the United States. It's the regulators." 


Keating is appearing on a series of talk shows to defend his point of view, 
even though he took the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer the questions of 
a congressional committee investigating Lincoln's failure. 


Keating said Congress is part of the problem. 


"The Congress tried to stop (former top thrift regulator) Ed Gray, and a lot of 
things happened there that make them guilty," Keating said of Congress. 


Gray testified before Congress last year that he turned down the request of 
five senators to ease investment rules affecting Lincoln. 


Those five senators are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee in 
connection with allegations of improperly trying to interfere with federal 
regulation in return for $1.3 million in campaign contributions. 


On Cable News Network on Thursday, Keating said he made donations to the 
senators -- Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Donald Riegle, D-Mich., John Glenn, 
D-Ohio, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John McCain R-Ariz. -- because he liked 
their views on the thrift industry. 


Lincoln, a unit of American Continental Corp., may be the most spectacular of 
the nation's thrift failures, because of the expected record cost of its 
bailout. 


Lincoln's parent filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, 1989. Regulators 
seized Lincoln a day later. 


American Continental's bankruptcy left shareholders and investors with 
now-worthless stocks and bonds. Among the bondholders are about 22,000 small 
investors who bought nearly $200 million in Lincoln's corporate bonds. 


Almost two-thirds of the buyers were elderly Lincoln depositors, many of whom 
thought the bonds were federally insured because they were sold in Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches.

VAN DE KAMP TO LAUNCH PROBE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS 




By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




SACRAMENTO 




Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Monday that he intends to launch "a 
far-reaching, two-pronged civil and criminal investigation" into troubled 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 


The decision to move ahead with a full-fledged investigation follows several 
months of congressional and legislative hearings into the events that led to a 
federal takeover of Lincoln last April following the collapse of the S&amp;L's 
parent company, American Continental Corp. Salvaging the Irvine-based Lincoln 
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion -- making it the most expensive 
S&amp;L bailout in history. 


Earlier this month, Van de Kamp was asked by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) to investigate Lincoln. But the attorney general hesitated, citing 
a conflict between his role as the state's top prosecutor and his job as 
attorney for the state of California. 


Van de Kamp described the conflict "as a delicate matter because of legal 
barriers against taking actions counter to a clients' interests." On the one 
hand, he has an obligation to prosecute possible government wrongdoers. But he 
may also have to defend the actions of the same individuals in a suit filed 
against the state and others by more than 22,000 customers of Lincoln. 


Those customers -- many of them Southern California retirees -- bought an 
estimated $250 million in American Continental bonds through the S&amp;L's 
branches. When the company entered bankruptcy proceedings, the bonds became 
virtually worthless. 


"My office is representing the California Department of Savings and Loan and 
the Department of Corporations in civil litigation where the state Treasury 
faces a potential liability of a quarter of a billion dollars," Van de Kamp 
said two weeks ago. At the same time, he noted that he had begun a criminal 
investigation into allegations that unlicensed employees of Lincoln had sold 
the bonds in violation of state law. 


Duane Peterson, a spokesman for Van de Kamp, said the attorney general will 
spell out the details of his investigation at a press conference today. 


Peterson said that it took "lots of legal research and some innovative 
thinking" to resolve Van de Kamp's conflict-of-interest problem but that the 
issue had been resolved.

FAD WATCH; 


A VOTE FOR ABE 




Yes, we love Kermit and Miss Piggy, and have a special place in our hearts for 
Gonzo. But when that tall figure of Abraham Lincoln stands up to speak in a 
Disneyland auditorium, and a deep and dignified voice begins to resonate, well, 
it's practically goose-bump time for some people. 


"The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the 
American people, just now, are much in the want of one," the robot says, 
quoting one of five speeches given by President Lincoln between 1838 and 1864. 
"We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the 
same thing." 


Since it was moved to Disneyland from the 1964 New York World's Fair, the 
Lincoln exhibit has been one of the park's most enduring attractions. Millions 
of park visitors have listened to Lincoln's five-minute address, given 51 times 
a day. 


It's not as popular as other exhibits, but it's a sentimental favorite. That's 
why many people were upset at reports that Disneyland was thinking of removing 
the exhibit to make room for the Muppets. 


Thankfully, Disneyland insists that talk of removing Mr. Lincoln from the 
park's Main Street home is decidedly premature. "We have not made a decision on 
Mr. Lincoln vis-a-vis the Muppets," a spokesman said. 


That's good. 


Not even the Muppets are an adequate reason to remove this stirring exhibit. It 
is a useful way to put people in touch with American history. Now, as in 
Lincoln's time, we need something to remind us to keep searching for a good 
definition of liberty.

DIVISION III BOYS; 


LINCOLN IMITATES LAKERS, WINS 2 IN A ROW 




By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 




SAN DIEGO 




Lincoln star Aaron Wilhite said his team was just following the lead of the Los 
Angeles Lakers Saturday in the Sports Arena. 


By defeating Clairemont, 89-59, in the San Diego Section Division III boys' 
basketball championship, Lincoln won back-to-back titles and pulled off what 
Wilhite described as something akin to the Lakers' consecutive NBA 
championships. 


"Back-to-back championships, just like the Lakers," said Wilhite, a senior 
center. 


Well, sort of. This was the first hurdle. Lincoln (27-1) advances to Southern 
Regional play and if things go according to plan, the Hornets will continue on 
to the State Division III final -- where they lost last year, 76-71, to Daly 
City Jefferson. 


Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski isn't thinking that far ahead but did say: "The only 
thing I want to do is to win the last game we play." 


If Lincoln keeps playing as it did against Clairemont (13-16), a team it beat 
twice in the regular season by 20- and 23-point margins, the Hornets should 
fare well in the coming rounds. 


The Hornets set the tone by employing their familiar full-court pressure 
defense and opened the first quarter with a 7-0 run. 


By halftime, Lincoln led, 40-21. 


"We had hoped to handle their press a little better," said Clairemont Coach 
Greg Lee. "But they're an excellent team. They destroyed us on the boards, they 
pursue the ball wonderfully and they have a couple of superstars who you can 
play good defense against and they'll still score.." 


Joe Temple, Lincoln's leading scorer, scored 30 points. 


"After playing them twice I thought they would be tougher," he said. "In the 
first half we just tried to discourage them. I came out pretty sloppy, but 
Aaron (Wilhite) was hot at the beginning." 


Wilhite scored 15 of his 29 points in the first half. Temple had 10 points in 
the first two periods. 


Clairemont's Ray McDavid led all scorers with 32 points.

U. S. TAKES OVER LINCOLN S &amp; L; 


SEIZURE FOLLOWS BANKRUPTCY FILING BY PARENT FIRM 




By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 




Just one day after its parent company filed for bankruptcy, federal regulators 
seized Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today because it had 
"dissipated its assets through violations of regulations and laws." 


The thrift's management, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said, "appeared to 
operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit of (its parent company, American 
Continental Corp.) at the expense of (Lincoln)." 


The thrift's 29 Southern California offices remained open, and depositors can 
transact business as usual. Deposits up to $100,000 are insured by the Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Lincoln has total deposits of $4.4 billion 
in 176,323 accounts. 


An oversight team led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began operating 
the $5.5-billion thrift at 7 a.m. today to "minimize losses, limit growth and 
ensure that operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner." 


Investors who own about $200 million worth of bonds may, however, lose some or 
all of their money as a result of American Continental's filing Thursday for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 


The company sold the bonds to customers in Lincoln's branches. 


Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which represents about 85% of American's assets, 
was not included in Thursday's bankruptcy filing. But federal regulators said 
the filing did include substantial assets in subsidiary operations of Lincoln. 


American Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. said he filed for bankruptcy after 
federal regulators demanded he relinquish control of Lincoln. 


American Continental has tried to sell Lincoln three times since last year. 
Federal regulators opposed the latest plan to sell Lincoln for $200 million to 
a group of investors led by John H. Rousselot, a former congressman from 
Arcadia, because the offer did not include sufficient cash. 


Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman earlier this week, resigned today, 
regulators said. 


The bank board named F. Roger Clark to serve as Lincoln's chief executive. 
Clark ran Montfort Savings in Dallas after it was seized by regulators.

PURCHASE DEAL IS RENEGOTIATED; 


LINCOLN SAVINGS ELECTS ROUSSELOT CHAIRMAN 




By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 




Former congressman John H. Rousselot, who is leading a bid to buy Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan, was elected chairman and chief executive of the Irvine 
thrift on Tuesday. At the same time, Rousselot said he has renegotiated his 
purchase agreement with the S&amp;L's parent firm. 


The new deal reduces the purchase price by $88 million to $200 million; removes 
four employees of Lincoln and its parent, American Continental Corp., from the 
investor group, and turns the deal more favorably toward Rousselot and Lincoln. 




Changes Necessary 


Both Rousselot's election and the new deal are designed to win quick regulatory 
approval of the troubled sale, said Rousselot and Mark M. Connally, a spokesman 
for Phoenix-based American Continental. 


As chairman of Lincoln, Rousselot replaces Robin S. Symes, who resigned in 
mid-January. As chief executive, he replaces Ray Fidel, who quit as president 
and chief executive Friday. The position of president will remain vacant for 
now, Connally said. 


Rousselot, who has been working daily on the sale with staff members of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said changes in management and terms were 
necessary. 


"The bank board made it clear last week that the application would not be 
making progress if it included members of Lincoln and American Continental," he 
said. "The bank board made it clear it wanted all new people." 


Connally said Fidel, who previously had hoped to stay on with Lincoln, stepped 
down as part of the effort by the S&amp;L and its parent "to convey that we are 
willing to make the changes necessary" to get the sale approved. 


Rousselot, who would be chairman of Lincoln after the proposed purchase, would 
give up his post as chief executive to a manager approved by regulators. One of 
the new terms, he said, is that all directors and top officers would be 
"pre-approved" by regulators. 


Other new terms include: 


* The purchase price was reduced to $200 million from $288.75 million, and the 
non-voting preferred stock that American Continental would get in return would 
not pay a dividend unless Lincoln is profitable. Charles H. Keating Jr., 
American Continental's chairman, picked up Lincoln in late 1984 for $51 
million. 


* American Continental would put $50 million in cash or securities into Lincoln 
to recapitalize the S&amp;L and would get nothing in return. Previously, the 
company was to put in $15 million and two New York businessmen were to put in 
$35 million, and all three were to receive preferred stock. The New York 
businessmen are no longer part of the deal. 


* The new buyers would raise up to $150 million in new capital over the next 
three years. No such commitment existed previously. 


* Keating and his family would personally guarantee repayment of $428 million 
in promissory notes that American Continental would give for the acquisition of 
three major Lincoln assets: the Phoenician Resort and the Crescent Hotel, both 
in the Phoenix area, and a 20% stake in General Oriental Investments Ltd., run 
by British financier Sir James Goldsmith. The $215-million note for the GOIL 
stock would be paid in three years instead of 10 years and other terms were 
tightened in an effort to persuade Keating to repay the notes earlier. 


* Lincoln would be converted into a federally chartered S&amp;L and would 
return to the San Francisco supervisory district, from which it was removed 
last year after complaints from Keating about hostile treatment. 


* Four employees of Lincoln and American Continental who were to run the 
S&amp;L are out. Rousselot has brought in new investors with no connection to 
the company or the S&amp;L, but the names are being withheld temporarily. Four 
of them, however, could be California businessmen who have agreed to join the 
board with Rousselot, who will give them the option of investing. 


The four are Thomas Kemp, former chief executive of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of 
Los Angeles and brother of U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack 
Kemp; Edward Barker, former commissioner of the State Department of Savings and 
Loan under former Gov. Ronald Reagan; Jerry Niemeyer, former chairman of Sears 
Savings Bank, and Ralph Alfieri, an Arcadia builder. 


Lincoln operates 29 branches throughout Southern California and had $5.5 
billion in assets at the end of December. 


American Continental posted a $36-million loss for the third quarter and 
financial analysts are waiting for its annual filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. That filing is due Monday and is widely expected to 
contain more bad news.
