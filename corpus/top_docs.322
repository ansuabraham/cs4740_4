      Today's highlight in history:
   On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made what was, in
effect, the first telephone call. His assistant, located in an
adjoining room in Boston, heard Bell's voice over the experimental
device say to him, ``Mr. Watson, come here. I want you.''
   On this date:
   In 1496, Christopher Columbus concluded his second visit to the
New World as he left Hispaniola for Spain.
   In 1629, England's King Charles I dissolved parliament. He would
not call it back for eleven years.
   In 1785, Thomas Jefferson was appointed minister to France,
succeeding Benjamin Franklin.
   In 1848, the Senate ratified the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
ending the war with Mexico.
   In 1864, Ulysses S. Grant became commander of the Union armies
in the Civil War.
   In 1880, the Salvation Army arrived in the United States from
England.
   In 1948, the anti-communist foreign minister of Czechoslovakia,
Jan Masaryk, plunged to his death in Prague.
   In 1949, Mildred E. Gillars, who had made wartime broadcasts for
the Nazis under the name ``Axis Sally,'' was convicted of treason
in Washington. (She ended up serving 12 years in prison.)
   In 1969, James Earl Ray pleaded guilty in Memphis, Tenn., to the
assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. (Ray
later repudiated that plea.)
   In 1987, the Vatican issued a 40-page document on scientific
techniques involving procreation, condemning such practices as
surrogate motherhood, test-tube births and cloning.
   Ten years ago: The author of the Scarsdale Diet, Dr. Herman
Tarnower, was shot to death at his home in Purchase, N.Y. Jean
Harris was arrested and later convicted of the crime.
   Five years ago: Soviet leader Konstantin U. Chernenko died at
age 73.
   One year ago: One day after the Senate rejected the defense
secretary nomination of John Tower, President Bush announced he
would nominate Republican Congressman Dick Cheney of Wyoming for
the post.
   Also one year ago: In South Africa, the main Afrikaner church _
the predominantly white Dutch Reformed Church _ for the first time
unequivocally condemned apartheid.
   Today's birthdays: Playwright David Rabe is 50. Newspaper
columnist Bob Greene is 43. Britain's Prince Edward is 26.
   Thought for today: ``Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.''

   In 1984, the Republican national convention in Dallas nominated
President Reagan and Vice President Bush for a second term in
office. (In a break with tradition, both renominations were
approved in a single roll-call vote.)

Kenya's struggle for independence, died in the city of Mombasa;
Vice President Daniel Arap Moi was sworn in as acting president. In

<TEXT>
Simon Russell Beale
If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the
Royal Shakespeare Company's Edward II, which has arrived at The Pit from
Stratford. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this
production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress
the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them,
and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from
the start.
For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this
self-inflicted wound. Simon Russell Beale is an actor of great versatility;
he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is
that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the
King of England with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in
the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role
as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog.
The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual
passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply
gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and
unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production
of light and shade.
Edward II, admittedly, is not Christopher Marlowe's best play: not a patch
on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well
as unmistakeable affinities with Shakespeare's Richard II. Its greatest
attraction is Piers Gaveston, the King's first favourite. The RSC's
Gaveston, played by Grant Thatcher, comes into his own only when he has been
beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has
little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white
leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an
earring. That is left to the King's next favourite, Spencer, whom we first
see under a sheet with a curate.
The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the
King does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly
be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that
of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what
Marlowe intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of
the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is
not there either.
The best performance is by Ciaran Hands as the young Mortimer. By the time
he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with
phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The
direction is by Gerard Murphy.

VIII, died 12 days after giving birth to Prince Edward, later King
Edward VI.
   In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War and
effectively destroyed the Holy Roman Empire.
   In 1861, the first transcontinental telegraph message was sent
as Justice Stephen J. Field of California transmitted a telegram to
President Abraham Lincoln.
   In 1901, Anna Edson Taylor, a 43-year-old widow, became the
first person to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and live to tell
about it. Mrs. Taylor's dreams of fame and fortune failed to
materialize, however, and she died in poverty in 1921.

jailed 40 days for his refusal to turn over notes on the case.
   Five years ago: President Reagan told a news conference he was
determined to keep U.S. Marines stationed in Lebanon, despite a
truck-bomb attack in Beirut the day before that claimed the lives
of 241 servicemen.
   One year ago: Thirty years after it was expelled for refusing to
answer allegations of corruption, the Teamsters union was welcomed
back into the AFL-CIO by a vote of the labor federation's executive
council in Miami Beach, Fla.

Football hall-of-famer Y.A. Tittle is 62. Actor-producer David
Nelson is 52. Rock musician Bill Wyman is 47. Actor Kevin Kline is

   A man who claims his family was given most
of the northern United States by the king of England during
colonial times has sued to get it back.
   Robert Brewster, of Longmont, Colo., said in his U.S. District
Court lawsuit, filed in Cheyenne, that he wants the land to set up
his own country for blue- and green-eyed people.
   Brewster claimed his family was given the land between the 40th
and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean. The 48th parallel is
approximately at the Canadian border and the 40th parallel
stretches approximately from Eureka, Calif., across the United
States to New York City.
   ``It is now necessary for the Brewsters to reclaim their land
before the federal government loses its ability to return the
land,'' the lawsuit said. ``The USA has lost its vision and is
collapsing every day with newspapers reporting each morning of
massive land purchases by Japan or OPEC.''
   The lawsuit filed Monday said Brewster is a descendant of
William Brewster, a founder of the Plymouth Colony in 1620 in what
is now Massachusetts.
   The lawsuit said William Brewster and his companions were given
the land by the King of England when they left that country to move
to the ``New World.''
   Brewster said he wants the land back so he can ``form an area
where only green-eyed and blue-eyed persons will be permitted.''
People with green and blue eyes are superior to those with brown
eyes, Brewster said, but will soon be extinct unless they are
protected.
   Brewster also asked the court for permission to establish a
standing army to protect the borders of his country.
   The United States, as represented by the U.S. Attorney's office
in Cheyenne, has 30 days to respond to Brewster's lawsuit,
according to a woman in the U.S. District Court clerk's office. She
said Wednesday that the case has been assigned to Judge Alan B.
Johnson, but no hearing date has been set.

   Today is Tuesday, Oct. 24, the 297th day of 1989. There are 68
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Oct. 24, 1939, nylon stockings went on sale
for the first time as several stores in Wilmington, Del., began
offering the much-awaited hosiery made with Du Pont's new synthetic
yarn. The day's shipment of 4,000 pairs of nylon stockings, ranging
in price from $1.15 to $1.35 a pair, sold out quickly.
   On this date:
   In 1537, Jane Seymour, the third wife of England's King Henry
VII, died 12 days after giving birth to Prince Edward, later King
Edward VI.
   In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War and
effectively destroyed the Holy Roman Empire.
   In 1861, the first transcontinental telegraph message was sent
as Justice Stephen J. Field of California sent a telegram to
President Abraham Lincoln.
   In 1901, Anna Edson Taylor, a 43-year-old widow, became the
first person to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and live to tell
about it. Mrs. Taylor's dreams of fame and fortune failed to
materialize, however, and she died in poverty in 1921.
   In 1931, the George Washington Bridge, connecting New York and
New Jersey, opened to traffic.
   In 1939, Benny Goodman and his orchestra recorded their
signature theme, ``Let's Dance,'' for Columbia Records in New York.
   In 1940, the 40-hour work week went into effect under the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938.
   In 1945, the United Nations officially came into existence as
its charter took effect.
   In 1952, in a speech in Detroit, Republican presidential
candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower declared, ``I shall go to Korea'' as
he promised to end the war.
   In 1962, the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the missile crisis
officially began under a proclamation signed by President Kennedy
the day before.
   In 1987, thirty years after it was expelled for refusing to
answer allegations of corruption, the Teamsters union was welcomed
back into the AFL-CIO.
   Ten years ago: President Carter announced the United States was
prepared to furnish $70 million in emergency food aid to Cambodia.
   Five years ago: A visit to Britain by French President Francois
Mitterrand was marred by a diplomatic flap as Scotland Yard
announced that a French bodyguard had planted unarmed explosives on
the grounds of the French ambassador's residence to test British
security.
   One year ago: The crew of the U.S.S. Vincennes received an
emotional homecoming in San Diego, nearly four months after the
cruiser shot down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf, killing
all 290 people aboard.
   Today's Birthdays: American League president Dr. Bobby Brown is
64. Football hall-of-famer Y.A. Tittle is 63. Actor-producer David
Nelson is 53. Actor Kevin Kline is 42.
   Thought for Today: ``Vanity, vanity, all is vanity, that's any
fun at all for humanity.'' _Ogden Nash, American poet (1902-1971).

FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: The Wilton Diptych remains enigmatic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more
monstrous proportions, the National Gallery in London has pioneered series
of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and
think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and
Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the
spotlight is directed towards the Wilton Diptych in the aftermath of its
recent cleaning and technical examination.
This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous
products of the late medieval world. It is also one of the most enigmatic.
Generations of scholars have debated who painted it, and why, and what it
meant to those who first saw it. The purpose of this exhibition, which is
supplemented by a small number of judicious loans of panels, manuscripts,
sculpture, metalwork and jewellery, is to offer visitors the possibility of
understanding a private and complex image. The temptation to tell them how
to interpret it is scrupulously resisted.
Although the Wilton Diptych has the inevitability of a dream, its two halves
make for a distinctly odd couple. On the barren earth of the left wing
kneels Richard II of England, identified as such by his personal emblems of
the white hart on his breast and the broomcods, or pods of the broom plant -
the planta genista from which the Plantagenets took their name - laced
around his neck. The three figures standing behind him - Edmund, king and
martyr, Edward the Confessor and John the Baptist - act as intercessors and
have been carefully chosen for their personal significance for the monarch.
The frieze of saints is remarkable for its evenly distributed verticality
while the profile portrait of the king has all the depth of a playing card.
The crowded panoply of the right wing could hardly be more different. Here
the Virgin stands cradling the Christ Child in a paradise garden, supported
by a company of angels who, wearing broomcods and white harts, seem to have
been liveried by the King of England rather than the Queen of Heaven. Arms
crossed, wings fluttering, seven of them form a backdrop to her, while four
more ring her round. This image is the epitome of a manner of painting that
was swept away by the Renaissance and the discovery of perspective, but here
too there is pictorial space.
The narrative link between the two is provided by the white banner
emblazoned by the red cross of Christ's Resurrection which is also the
banner of St George. Its pinnacle is a silvered orb and that too alludes to
England. Recent cleaning has revealed that it contains a minute
representation of a green island, a white tower with two turrets, and a boat
in full sail. It is hard not to read it as 'this sceptred isle . . . and
precious stone set in the silver sea' of John of Gaunt's speech in
Shakespeare's Richard II.
This is no standard image of a donor being presented to the Virgin by his
patrons. Rather, it appears a carefully orchestrated expression of Richard's
notion of the divine nature of his kingship and his hopes for salvation. As
such, the altarpiece is likely to have been made for the private devotions
of the king, a few years before his untimely death in 1399.
The Wilton Diptych is one of the high points of the so-called International
Style, that phase of late Gothic art when painters and sculptors all over
Europe seemed to be marching to the same drum. Such is the extent of
cross-fertilisation that no agreement has been reached about whether its
creator was English, French, Italian or Bohemian. The recent technical
examination has only confirmed that while the preparation of the ground of
the oak panels is typically Northern, the technique adopted for binding the
pigments and for the green undermodelling of the flesh tones is
characteristically Italian. The use of egg white allowed the painter to
exploit the full purity of the precious lapis lazuli which he ground to
produce the brilliant ultramarine.
Wherever he came from, the anonymous master of the Wilton Diptych was a
great painter. This is his (or her?) only surviving work. We have no idea
whether it belongs to his youth, maturity or old age. One thing is certain,
however: if it had not survived, no one would have felt the lack of it. The
picture stands as a poignant reminder of how much of our past has been lost.
That, and not just its quality, is part of its enchantment.

<TEXT>
   Friends of former President Franklin D.
Roosevelt celebrated Sunday the 50th anniversary of King George VI's
visit to Hyde Park, believed to have strengthened U.S.-Anglo
relations on the eve of World War II.
   About 250 people turned out at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library
on the grounds of the Roosevelt home, said William Emerson, library
director.
   England's King George and Queen Elizabeth visited Roosevelt's
home June 11, 1939, during a tour of the United States.
   Sunday's celebration began the same way the king and queen's
visit did, with morning prayers at St. James Episcopal Church.
British Amabassador Antony Acland read an Episcopalian lesson
similar to the service attended by the Roosevelts and the king and
queen in 1939.
   Acland opened a special exhibit at the FDR Library that includes
the king's notes on conversations he had with Roosevelt about how
the United States might help Great Britain against Germany, Emerson
said.
   Acland also read a message from Queen Mother Elizabeth
reminiscing about her 1939 visit.
   Roosevelt invited the king and queen as part of his strategy to
shift American public opinion and policy away from isolationism,
Emerson said.

<LEADPARA>  In December 1940, with German bombs raining on his cities, Britain's Duke of
Windsor tried to enlist President Roosevelt to sell out his country to Hitler,
the custodian of 50-year-old interview notes said Thursday.;   The duke, who
four years earlier had abdicated as king of England to marry a divorced
American woman, is said to have made the overture to author Fulton Oursler,
who was interviewing him for Liberty magazine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      Oursler's notes say the plan was for Roosevelt to offer to intervene for
peace between England and Germany. The duke, still enormously popular in his
beleaguered nation, would immediately support the idea in terms that would
touch off a revolution in Britain.;   During the interview with the former
Edward VIII, Oursler brought up speculation that Hitler might be overthrown by
Germans in the wake of Italian defeats in Greece.;   Oursler's notes say the
duke "said there was too much wishful thinking; that there would be no
revolution in Germany and it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler
were overthrown. Hitler, he said, was the right and logical leader of the
German people. . . . He regarded Hitler as a great man.";   When Oursler saw
Roosevelt later, the president already knew about the proposal, says Oursler's
son, Fulton Oursler Jr.;   Roosevelt then drafted an ambiguous reply, which
evidently put an end to the overture.  </TEXT>
