   Virginia's joint celebration Monday of the
birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights
leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is ``the perfect combination of
diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger.
   Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who as a state senator five years ago
pushed through the bill making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a Virginia
holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday
with Virginia natives Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson.
   ``I find no irony in it at all,'' Wilder, a grandson of slaves
and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since
Reconstruction, said Friday. ``It shows we are prepared to recognize
good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think
all three were men of principle.''
   James Farmer, a civil rights leader who worked with King, said
Saturday that King deserves a day all his own because ``Martin
Luther King stood alone as a giant.''
   But he said King would have been amused at being linked with
heroes of the Confederacy.
   ``Dr. King was very tolerant of things like that,'' Farmer said.
``If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.''
   The bill passed the state legislature in 1984 after seven years
of effort by Wilder and often acrimonious debate in public hearings.
   Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday
when favorite sons such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry did
not have their own days. Celebrating King's birthday on the third
Monday in January, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew
protest.
   King's birthday is Jan. 15, 1929. Lee was born Jan. 19, 1807 and
Jackson was born Jan. 21, 1824.
   ``The memory of Lee and Jackson is sacred to the hearts of all
true Virginians. To replace our heroes with Martin Luther King or
any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage
as a commonwealth,'' Forest Tucker, a member of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, said in 1984.
   But Wilder persisted. ``I have never taken to the floor of the
Senate to say one word against Stonewall Jackson,'' he told his
fellow legislators five years ago. ``I have never failed to stand in
honor of Robert E. Lee. But that cause which is sacred to many
Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.''
   Wilder, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor
this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In Richmond,
for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the
slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a
touring stage show performing works by black writers.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday in all states
except Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and
Wyoming. Mississippians honor both Lee's and King's birthdays on the
same day.
   Charles Sadler, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Federal
Holiday Commission in Washington, D.C., said his group doesn't mind
how King's birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday
is ``better than nothing,'' he said.

   Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. amid renewed calls to strive for the
goals of the slain civil rights leader.
   Marchers filled city streets in San Franciso, the Liberty Bell in
Philadelphia was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended
on King's hometown to join his family in Atlanta on the federal day
marking his 60th birthday.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,''
President-elect Bush told black leaders in Washington. ``He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   A unity march across the University of Michigan campus in Ann
Arbor drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's
carillon played ``We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil
rights movement.
   Later Monday, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young told a University of
Michigan audience that, ``The world King left is not a great deal
different.''
   ``But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the
solution to the world's problems, as we learned in Vietnam, as the
Russians have learned in Afghanistan, and as the PLO has learned.''
   Nowhere was King's influence felt more strongly than in Selma,
Ala., where he began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped
establish voting rights for blacks throughout the South.
   On Monday, three blacks were sworn in as members of the Dallas
County Commission in Selma. They became the first black Dallas
County commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member
commission a black majority.
   ``We bring home to Dallas County the harvest of the Martin Luther
King voting rights act,'' said U.S. District Judge U. W. Clemon, the
first black federal judge in Alabama, who administered the oath of
office.
   King's widow, Corretta Scott King, was joined by black and white
political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, once one of King's young lieutenants,
used the occasion to criticize the Reagan administration's civil
rights record and President Reagan's suggestion that civil rights
leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of
oppression among blacks.
   Jackson called Reagan's statements ``petty comments from the same
man who implied that Martin Luther King Jr. was a communist.''
   In Pretoria, South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, who is
black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that
will sit in a new U.S. embassay compound. The ceremony included
blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of South Africa's
system of racial separation.
   In the United States, parades were held in places like New
Orleans, Honolulu, Atlanta and San Antonio, where 15,000 people
marching from four directions converged on Martin Luther King Jr.
Plaza.
   ``I took part because Dr. King's dream has not been fully
realized,'' said Elbert Winbush, 32, of Oakland, Calif., who joined
10,000 others in the San Francisco parade with his three daughters.
   King would have been 60 on Sunday. He was 39 years old when he
was shot to death by a sniper in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968.
   King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in
1986, three years after Congress named the third Monday in January
as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day
as a state holiday. The six states are Arizona, New Hampshire,
Montana, Idaho, South Dakota and Wyoming.
   In Philadelphia, when black leaders symbolically struck the
Liberty Bell as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor W.
Wilson Goode cited the bell's famous crack.
   ``That crack is a symbol that there are some things
unfulfilled,'' Goode said.
   At the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, children struck the state's
replica of the Liberty Bell.
   ``He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He
tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said Sharonda
Gardenhire, 10, of Lansing, shortly after she gave the rope a tug.
   A speech by one of King's sons in Eugene, Ore., was delayed for
about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance
resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found.
   Martin Luther King III said that in the 21 years since his father
was assassinated ``this nation has made great strides.'' But he
added that, ``I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to
do.''

   Wyoming's Legislature approved a bill
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with a
holiday after debating the issue for seven years.
   The Senate voted 21-9 to concur with House changes to the
proposal, calling the holiday Martin Luther King Jr.-Wyoming
Equality Day and celebrating it on the third Monday in January.
   If Gov. Mike Sullivan approves the legislation, Wyoming will
become the 46th state along with the federal government to observe
the holiday.
   Wyoming observed the federal holiday for the first time on Jan.
15, King's actual birthday. King's birthday became the 10th
national holiday in 1986, eight years after he was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn.
   The four states that do not recognize the federal holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.
   The Legislature dropped Columbus Day, celebrated on the second
Monday in October, from Wyoming's list of legal paid holidays. The
House had added the amendment to prevent the state from having to
pay more to state employees who got the day off.

   Wyoming became the 46th state to honor
Martin Luther King Jr.'s ideals when Gov. Mike Sullivan signed
legislation Thursday creating a state holiday dedicated to equal
rights.
   Although Wyoming calls itself the Equality State because it was
the first to give women the vote, it took years for lawmakers to
agree to set aside the third Monday in January in King's honor.
   Legislative leaders opposed to the holiday questioned whether
King should be singled out, noting that many other Americans also
fought for civil rights.
   The legislation Sullivan signed into law creates ``Martin Luther
King Jr. Wyoming Equality Day.''
   Championing the measure for the past eight years has been state
Sen. Liz Byrd, the Legislature's only black.
   ``It was a real disappointment each year to watch the failure of
the Martin Luther King Jr. legislation in the Wyoming
Legislature,'' she told the crowd jamming the Statehouse rotunda
for the signing ceremony. ``Those years of trying to get this
legislation passed were trying times. But today is a happy day.
Today is a historic day.
   ``What a wonderful centennial gift to be here today and to have
this bill,'' Byrd added, referring to Wyoming's 100th birthday this
July 10.
   The King holiday did not come easily. Senate opponents urged the
body to reject a holiday in King's name and support one simply
commemorating equal rights.
   The House also was uneasy with the holiday in King's name only
and added the Wyoming Equality Day provision to the legislation.
   The four states that do not recognize the King holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.

   Compromises have allowed Wyoming and Idaho to join the movement
toward national acceptance of a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and by Wednesday, 22 years after his death, only
three states were holdouts.
   ``I think it shows that we are making headway,'' Lloyd Davis,
executive director of the King Federal Holiday Commission, said
Tuesday.
   He expressed confidence that Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana
would not hold out much longer amid what he sees as dramatic
applications of King's non-violent philosophy as far away as the
Philippines, China, Poland and East Germany.
   ``What's happening around the world shows the universality of
King,'' Davis said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   King was assassinated April 4, 1968, at age 39, while leading a
non-violent movement for racial equality. In 1983, after
considerable debate, Congress created a holiday to honor King on
the third Monday in January, around his Jan. 15 birthday.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day, first celebrated nationally in 1986,
is an official state holiday in some form in most states _ Idaho is
about to become the 47th.
   Wyoming, which calls itself the Equality State because it was
the first to give women the vote, had legislators who supported a
holiday commemorating equal rights but didn't want it in King's
name. A compromise created Martin Luther King Jr. Wyoming Equality
Day.
   Idaho legislators gave final approval Friday to an official
state holiday honoring King, but only after a compromise added
Idaho Human Rights Day to the designation. The bill has gone to
Gov. Cecil Andrus, who called for its passage in January.
   New Hampshire legislators have voted down holiday proposals
first introduced in 1979. After losing in 1989, supporters said
they would try again in 1991, the next time legislative rules allow
it.
   ``There are times when New Hampshire can feel pride in its
unique posture,'' state Rep. Deborah ``Arnie'' Arnesen, said
Tuesday. ``However, I feel that our unique status, vis-a-vis this
holiday, does not suggest a badge of courage but rather a badge of
intolerance and prejudice.''
   Edward Dupont, New Hampshire's Senate Republican leader, says
the proposal won't succeed if the holiday is meant to honor King
alone. He suggested a day to honor King ``as one of many civil
rights contributors,'' including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,
rather than going along with national practice.
   ``We always have the distinction of being the last or the
first,'' he said. Montana's Legislature in 1987 approved a bill
making Jan. 15 a ``day of observance'' and creating Heritage Day, a
floating holiday to be designated by the governor. This year Gov.
Stan Stephens used it to create a long Thanksgiving weekend,
causing no controversy in a state whose black population was
counted at 1,786, or a fifth of a percent, in the 1980 census.
   Arizona is the most populous state without a King holiday, but
it hasn't attained that status without contortions.
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, a conservative who opposed his
predecessor's creation of a limited paid holiday in King's honor,
proclaimed a Martin Luther King-Civil Rights Day for the third
Sunday in January instead.
   Last year, the Legislature approved King Day as a paid holiday
for state employees, and Gov. Rose Mofford signed the bill. But
opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking effect unless
it's approved in a referendum in November.
   Some of the opponents were upset by revelations about womanizing
by King or were persuaded by the Ku Klux Klan's repeated efforts to
tar King as a Communist. Others had nothing against honoring King,
but were up-at-arms that the Legislature made room in the budget
for King Day by dropping Columbus Day as a paid holiday.
   The Legislature took that course because Republican members
didn't like two alternatives: 1) combining the Lincoln and
Washington birthdays into one Presidents' Day, as the federal
government did, or 2) springing for an additional holiday.
   While a holiday costs overtime pay for indispensable workers,
Mofford and other Democrats and some moderate Republicans argued
that not having one could also be expensive. The state has faced a
sporadic boycott, especially as a convention and meeting site.
   When the National Football League's owners awarded the 1993
Super Bowl to the Phoenix area March 13, Norman Braman, head of the
site selection committee, said: ``If there is a smear on the Martin
Luther King Holiday of any kind, I will personally lead the effort
to rescind the Super Bowl. We wouldn't want to go there.''
   Phoenix and suburban Tempe, where the game would be played, have
their own King holiday.

<P>
As Americans remembered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his 60th birthday 
anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, Coretta Scott 
King, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address Sunday, calling the civil 
rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
At Boston University's School of Theology, where King received a doctorate 
degree in 1955, students and teachers gathered for a Sunday night candlelight 
vigil. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush, returning to Washington on Sunday from a three-day 
Florida fishing vacation, scheduled an address to a prayer breakfast at a 
Washington hotel today -- a federal holiday recognized by every state except 
Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
King was killed by a sniper on April 4, 1968, while standing on a motel balcony 
in Memphis, Tenn. The assassin, James Earl Ray, was imprisoned for life. 
</P>
<P>
In Selma, Ala., three blacks will be sworn in as members of the Dallas County 
Commission today. It was there that King began the historic 1965 
Selma-to-Montgomery march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of Erskine Minor, Perry Varner and D. L. Pope will end 112 
years of white county rule and 10 years of legal battles to keep the commission 
white in a place where 55% of the residents are black. The three new 
commissioners were elected in special balloting last month. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. King, speaking at the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where 
King and his father shared the pulpit, said the ceremony was to honor "a 
courageous young dreamer who picked up the torch of freedom and carried it from 
Montgomery to Memphis with an unshakable faith in the promise of the American 
dream. Martin passed that torch to us to continue the pursuit of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Although the 'white only' signs of the 1950s and 1960s are gone," she 
said, "segregated neighborhoods and schools remain a pervasive fact of American 
life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Play by Boston Students 
</P>
<P>
The city of Boston was hosting a ceremony and a tribute to King, including a 
performance today of a play written by students titled "Dreams." The play's 
title was taken from King's moving 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
An interfaith service was held in the nation's capital at the Washington Hebrew 
Congregation to commemorate King's birthday, and the civil rights leader was 
remembered in religious services throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, the Mormon Church said it is closing its offices today to 
allow church employees to observe the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Boston University was holding religious services to commemorate King's birthday 
and to mark today's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in a sermon Sunday at a church in New York's 
poverty-stricken Harlem section, lashed out at those who set back King's 
efforts by "self-destruction" through drugs and violence. "Dr. King was our 
gift from God. Martin Luther King did not fight and die for your right to use 
cocaine, crack and heroin," said Jackson, who marched for civil rights with 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will be in Atlanta today to deliver a sermon and help lead a parade. 
Tonight in Los Angeles, he will receive the SCLC Martin Luther King Award.

thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
America and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, wound down King Boulevard and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
Russia," said a smiling Ivan Jones, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from Martin Luther King. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said Keith Strong, 36, referring to Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the 
newly inaugurated governor of Virginia. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what Martin Luther King was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for Dr. King and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said Margie Manyweather, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. Gina Temple, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only King's birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said Donyielle Holley, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor Tom Bradley rang the City Hall bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of Security Pacific National Bank's downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that Security Pacific stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said Susan Anderson of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of Security 
Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God.

   Worshippers filling the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s church were admonished today to remember the slain civil
rights leader's birthday by rededicating themselves to his work.
   ``It is our hope and our desire ... that we will realize it is an
unending quest,'' said the Rev. Joseph Roberts, pastor of Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   Roberts opened the annual ecumenical service that attracted
local, state and federal officials to mark the national holiday
honoring King. Among those gathered on the podium were members of
King's family, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, actress Jane Fonda, Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris and
the state's senators and congressmen.
   Thornburgh called King ``a martyr slain in his prime while trying
to make America and the world a place where justice, freedom and
peace could flourish.''
   President-elect George Bush sent a letter to be read at the
service, in which he pledged that his administration ``will work
tirelessly for the strict enforcement of civil rights as well as for
absolute equality for all Americans.''
   In Washington, Bush commemorated the holiday with a glowing
tribute to King in a speech to about 300 prominent blacks.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' Bush told members of the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   Looking ahead to his inauguration on Friday, Bush said: ``What
becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us. We must not fail
him. We must not fail ourselves.''
   In South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins marked the
holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King on a bushy plot of land
in Pretoria where the new U.S. embassy is to stand.
   In Boston, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis invoked King's
memory when he announced an executive order that will bar the state
from buying goods and services from companies that have dealings
with the South African government.
   In Groton, Conn., 51 demonstrators were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct at the Electric Boat shipyard as they protested
the construction of Trident nuclear submarines. The demonstrators,
many carrying pictures of King and citing his belief in non-violent
protest, said the demonstration was held in observance of his
birthday.
   Elsewhere around the nation, planned observances of the King
holiday included the swearing-in of the first blacks on the Dallas
County (Ala.) Commission in more than a century. The ceremony was
scheduled for Selma, where King began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was to be symbolically tapped
today and church and school bells were being rung in Michigan.
Golfers were to tee off in a suburban Los Angeles tournament
benefiting King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   The observance at Ebenezer Baptist Church capped a week of
remembrance in King's hometown. At the church Sunday, King's widow
urged Bush to hold true to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation''
and to impose strict sanctions against South Africa.
   In addition, Coretta Scott King said in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' speech, the United States must do more by ``providing
education and economic assistance directly to black South Africans
who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' she said. ``But a kinder, gentler
nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   Mrs. King spoke before an estimated 1,200 people at the church
where King and his father were co-pastors. It may have been her
final ``State of the Dream'' address as president of The King
Center, a memorial and policy center in Atlanta.
   On Saturday, she announced that her 27-year-old son, Dexter Scott
King, would assume the presidency April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of
King's assassination at a Memphis, Tenn., motel in 1968.
   Today is the fourth year for the King national holiday. In 1983,
after considerable debate, Congress named the third Monday in
January as a national holiday honoring King, whose actual birthday
was Sunday.
   Most states also observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state
holiday. Among the few that don't is Arizona, where rallies were
planned in Phoenix and Tucson and where prospects are uncertain for
a measure that lawmakers plan to introduce this year.

   Thousands marched and prayed and church bells rang on the
birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., while
protesters demonstrated against states, schools and businesses not
observing the federal holiday.
   Three Ku Klux Klansmen handed out leaflets in New Hampshire,
fights broke out between blacks and whites in Louisiana and South
Carolina and racist graffiti was sprayed on signs on a California
highway named after King.
   King's survivors and others remembering him in services around
the nation said they harbored no illusions that his work was
finished.
   ``It's great that we celebrate his birthday but this day should
be a day where we recommit ourselves to finishing his dream,''
King's son, Martin Luther King 3rd, who was 10 when his father died
in 1968, told 500 people at a DePaul University church after
leading a candlelight march Monday night.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, spoke in Atlanta at an annual
ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband
delivered some of his most stirring orations.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on Dr. King's teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' she said.
   Security for the service was heavy following recent racially
motivated mail bombings in the Southeast. Bomb-sniffing dogs
inspected the church beforehand; visitors were required for the
first time to pass through metal detectors, and police took up
posts throughout the church during the service.
   Security also was heavy for a March of Celebration held later in
downtown Atlanta. Police estimated 400,000 people watched.
   A former top King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams,
complained that the parade trivialized the day and wasted money
better spent on the poor. ``This has been prostituted more than any
other holiday except Jesus Christ's birthday,'' he said outside an
Atlanta housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined Los Angeles' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in Boston. In
Memphis, Tenn., about 300 people gathered at The Lorraine Motel,
where King was assassinated on April 4, 1968.
   ``We didn't want the children to think that Martin Luther King's
birthday was just another day for watching television,'' said
Mardest Van Hooks, a Memphis teacher who helped bring a group of
youngsters to The Lorraine.
   The Washington-based Federal Holiday Commission said bells
chimed at 12:30 p.m. EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was tapped three times. The New York
Stock Exchange paused for a moment at noon.
   The holiday, first celebrated in 1986, fell on King's actual
birthday for the first time.
   In New Hampshire, one of four states without any form of King
holiday, students at high schools in Concord, Milford, Merrimack
and Wolfeboro staged protest rallies.
   ``Martin Luther King wasn't just for black people. He changed
everything for everyone, not just black people,'' Merrimack Valley
High senior John Morin, who is white, told fellow students.
   In Arizona, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a Phoenix crowd estimated at nearly 15,000 heard
lawmakers and community leaders at the Capitol urge them to vote in
a referendum this fall over whether to let a King Day observance
become law.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced Monday in the
Idaho Senate. Montana also has no form of King Holiday, while some
other states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways.
   About 200 people protested outside a bank in Buffalo, N.Y., that
stayed open. Norman Eenith, 35, held an outstretched dollar bill
and said, ``This is what it's all about.''
   In New Orleans, following a parade in King's honor attended by
tens of thousands, two whites were arrested after a fight in which
a black man was hit with nail-studded boards, officials said.
   At Garrett High School in Charleston, S.C., one of several area
schools that canceled the day off to make up for days lost during
Hurricane Hugo, about five black students angry at having to attend
school on the holiday assaulted two white students, Principal Rex
Whitcomb said. Police helped restore order.
   In San Diego, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,'' thought
to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' police said.
   In Florida, a county commissioner said he received numerous
telephone threats after he protested a newspaper advertisement
depicting King, a birthday cake and a garbage truck. The ad said
trash would be picked up as usual Monday.
   ``All of a sudden I recognized that I felt a particular fear
that as a young white man, fairly protected growing up, I had never
felt before _ what so many people in this group must have felt,''
Yordon said.

<TEXT>
   The Idaho House approved legislation
Wednesday to make Idaho the 47th state with a holiday honoring
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The House voted 53-27 for the bill previously passed by the
Senate. Later, the Senate accepted a House amendment that made the
holiday's complete name ``Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
Day.''
   Final approval by the Senate was expected Thursday before the
bill goes to Gov. Cecil Andrus, who proposed the holiday.
   The bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the
legislature last week. Opponents said their constituents didn't
care about Martin Luther King.
   ``We're told this isn't a black holiday, but yet we're also told
we can't change the name,'' said Rep. Stan Hawkins, a Republican.
``If you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this, you're
making a mistake.''
   Rep. L. Ed Brown, also a Republican and one of the bill's
sponsors, said the decision on the bill would ``say more about
Idaho than .. about Martin Luther King.''
   ``Idaho is not the state in the Union that's going to determine
Martin Luther King's greatness,'' Brown said. ``Forty-six states
and the federal government have already done that.''
   Brown said adopting a King holiday would ``send a very special
message to future generations about how Idahoans feel about
minorities.''
   Besides Idaho, only Arizona, Montana and New Hampshire have not
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday
honoring King on the third Monday in January.
   The Idaho Legislature created a state commemorative day in 1987,
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a House committee last
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the
perception some have of Idaho as a haven for racists.
   Opponents said they objected to another day off for government
employees. Proponents said Idaho's economy would suffer through
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the
holiday.

<LEADPARA>  Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to peace was high on the

San Jose this morning.;    "I'm coming to honor what Martin Luther King

<TEXT>     "Until you end war, you won't end poverty, and until you end poverty, you
won't end racism," Cossman said. "They are all tied together. The things he
represented are being set back by war in Iraq.";    He added, "Every time a
plane goes down, the money spent on that plane represents I don't know how
many other lives lost to poverty, in addition to the tragedy of the loss of
the pilot's life.";    Dr. Amos Brown, pastor of the Third Baptist Church in
San Francisco and chairman for that city's program today, was in San Jose to
ride the train.;    Brown saw definite parallels between King and the war in
the Middle East.;    "King was a non-violent prophet-philosopher who took a
stand calling for the end of the Vietnam War, even when it was unpopular to do
so," Brown recalled. "I often heard him say it would have been morally
inconsistent for him to talk about freedom and justice for blacks and not be
concerned about lives in Vietnam.";    He believes the slain civil rights
leader "would have said we should have gone to the conference table to
negotiate a settlement. He would have raised some serious questions regarding
the fairness and justice of 25 to 30 percent of the men and women in the
Persian Gulf being black or other minorities. He would have seen this as a
fallout of racism and injustice in our nation.";    In San Francisco today,
several hundred people gathered in a poor neighborhood in a march to
commemorate King's birthday.;    Participants carried placards that read
"There has got to be a way to connect the human race," and other slogans
reminiscent of the slain civil rights leader's non-violent philosophy.;    "We
have come to Bayview-Hunters Point to affirm peace in our society and to deal
with our domestic problems -- drugs and violence," said the Rev. Cecil
Williams of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.;    "This is an
affirmation of what Martin Luther King preached -- pro-peace, not anti-war,"
he said. "We want to live peace. We want to stop the war.";    In Atlanta on
Sunday, King's widow, Coretta Scott King and others observing the civil rights
leader's birthday remembered him as an advocate of non-violence and urged an
immediate halt to the Persian Gulf war.;    "Our most urgent short-term
priority at the international level is a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf,"
Coretta King said in her annual State of the Dream speech Sunday at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.;    In Texas, Girl Scouts in a Dallas parade honoring King on
Saturday carried a 10-foot-long banner saying, "King's dream did not include
war.";    Today's holiday winds up 10 days of celebrations marking King's
birthday. Assassinated in 1968, King would have turned 62 on Jan. 15. The
federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of January.;    In the 22nd
annual King ecumenical service this morning at Ebenezer, where King and his
father were co-pastors, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said he was angered by
war-related polls showing that many white Americans believe blacks who oppose
the war are unpatriotic.;    "Let's set the record straight," he said. "The
ethnic group that has produced the fewest number of traitors in time of war is
Afro-Americans.";    Jackson noted that a large percentage of blacks are
serving with the U.S. military in the Persian Gulf.;    A rally honoring King
was scheduled today in Helena, Mont. Montana, Arizona and New Hampshire are
the only states where his birthday still isn't a paid state holiday.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Worshipers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in Atlanta was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams, stood in
front of an Atlanta housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of King's dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, King's field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
David Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's
first elected black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, as he pounded three times with his fist on the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon.
   In New Hampshire, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 Merrimack Valley High School pupils walked
out of morning classes today in Concord to recognize Martin Luther
King Day, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
Mike Krumenacker, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, Arizona, thousands marched in
Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
Phoenix as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   On Sunday, Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the last year, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of Berlin and Beijing, Budapest and
Pretoria, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in Atlanta, more than 500 students and teachers at Booker
T. Washington High School joined civil rights leader Rosa Parks to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In Boston, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
October, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor Raymond
Flynn.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that Charles
Stuart himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor Flynn should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said Sadiki Kambon, director of a group called the
Community for Human Rights.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (October) night and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' Kambon
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in Mission Hill and the entire city.''
   In New York, Dinkins told about 400 people at Judson Memorial
Church that ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in Saturday, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' on Sunday that a black could occupy the White
House ``in our time.''
   In Seattle, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president and co-founder of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, addressed 900 people
Saturday night.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' Lowery said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of Martin
Luther King demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

   Church bells across the country tolled the loss of Martin Luther
King Jr. on his birthday Monday, a ringing reminder of the racial
conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to overcome but
which still haunt the nation.
   ``With each ring we are called to an accountability, an
accountability of the soul and of the heart's conscience that asks,
`What have you done to let freedom ring?''' asked Pennsylvania Gov.
Robert P. Casey during a ceremony at the Liberty Bell.
   A moment of silence was called to reflect on King's lessons of
non-violence in his pursuit of racial equality. The
Washington-based Federal Holiday Commission said bells chimed at
12:30 p.m. EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The New York
Stock Exchange paused for a moment at noon.
   ``Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, who pounded the Liberty Bell three times with his fist.
``Those who have been denied liberty love it most. Dr. King loved
liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   Most of the celebrations were peaceful, but the memory of King's
espousal of nonviolent resistance didn't prevent fights from
breaking out in New Orleans following a parade in his honor
attended by tens of thousands of people.
   Two whites were arrested after a fight in which a black man was
hit with nail-studded boards. A teen-ager was fatally stabbed and a
young black man was critically wounded by a stray bullet in
separate fights between groups of black teens, officials said.
   In San Diego, racist graffitti was sprayed on signs on a freeway
named for him,and demonstrations protesting non-observance of the
holiday took place in Arizona, New Hampshire and elsewhere.
   The observances followed church services, parades, and other
celebrations held during the weekend before the federal holiday,
which for the first time falls on King's actual birthday. He would
have been 61.
   Much of Monday's focus was on Atlanta, where King grew up as the
son of a Baptist minister.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on Dr. King's teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' said his
widow, Coretta Scott King, at an annual ecumenical service at
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband delivered some of his
most stirring orations.
   A ``March of Celebration'' also was held, despite bitter
objections from one of King's top lieutenants in the civil rights
movement who charged the parade trivialized the day and wasted
money that could serve the poor.
   ``This has been prostituted more than any other holiday except
Jesus Christ's birthday,'' the Rev. Hosea Williams said at a news
conference in front of an Atlanta housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined Los Angeles' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in Boston.
   During his lifetime, King led non-violent marches and protests
in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities.
   His first blow against racism came when he led a year long
bocott of segregated buses in Montgomery, Ala. From there he
established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to set the
pace of working peacefully for equal rights for blacks. In 1964, he
received the Nobel Peace Prize.
   He was shot and killed on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   But racial inequities and clashes still tear at America's
consciousness today.
   In the Southeast, there have been a series of bombings and
threats, apparently racially motivated, and in Boston race
relations were strained after an apparent hoax in which a white man
claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife and wounded
him.
   Boston residents on Monday spoke of the racial implications of
Charles Stuart's grisly fraud.
   ``The Stuart case has shown how fragile race relations are in
this country,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing. ``And it's become a
kind of metaphor for healing.''
   The day, however, came at a moment of gains for blacks, the
first day on the job for the nation's first elected black governor
in Virginia and the start of a new administion for New York City's
first black mayor.
   L. Douglas Wilder's victory in Virginia inspires, some said.
   ``Is it not poetic justice that the first day of Doug Wilder's
stay in office takes place on the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.?'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked at a prayer breakfast in
Washington, D.C.
   In New York, about 120 people who walked across the Brooklyn
Bridge to City Hall in the 10th annual march were greeted by Mayor
David Dinkins.
   In addition to the gala celebrations, King's birthday was marked
with protests.
   Several took place in Concord, N.H. About 150 Merrimack Valley
High School students walked out of morning classes to recognize
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which their school did not observe.
   A school custodian hoisted the American flag half-staff as the
students recited the Pledge of Allegiance during the half-hour
ceremony.
   New Hampshire is one of four states without any form of King
holiday. The others are Arizona, Montana and Idaho. Some other
states keep workers on the job, but mark the day in other ways.
   Several hundred students and faculty members at St. Paul's
School, which announced Monday morning that it would observe the
holiday, marched from the private school's Concord campus to the
Statehouse.
   More than 200 students in Milford, N.H., staged a sit-in at the
high school library, and 125 in Wolfeboro staged a lunchtime
demonstration that kept them out of classes for two hours.
   In another Concord demonstration, about 150 members of the
anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance marched from the Federal Building
to the Statehouse plaza to protest the Seabrook nuclear plant.
   They sang songs against the plant and such civil rights hymns as
``We Shall Overcome.'' Thirty-seven people who stayed inside the
Statehouse after closing time were arrested on criminal trespass
charges.
   In Arizona, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a Phoenix crowd estimated by police at nearly 15,000
heard lawmakers and community leaders at the capitol urge them to
register and vote in a referendum this fall over whether to let a
King Day observance become law. Another 2,000 people marched in
Tucson.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced in the Idaho
Senate, but an effort to win immediate consideration for a similar
bill was defeated in the South Dakota House.
   In Columbia, Mo., about 200 students sat down inside the
University of Missouri's administration building to protest the
school's decision not to cancel classes for the day.
   About 100 people in Monroe, La., demonstrated outside the
Ouachita Parish School Board to protest its refusal to observe the
holiday.
   In San Diego, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted overnight with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,''
thought to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' said police Lt. John
Gregory.

<HEAD>Coretta Scott King Seeks Federal Funds for Holiday Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta Scott King says Congress must provide
``the means and encouragement'' for the federal commission that
coordinates observances of the holiday honoring her late husband,
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``The Congress placed an enormous responsibility upon the
commission, but it gave no funds,'' Mrs. King, who chairs the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, told a House
panel Tuesday.
   ``I ask the Congress which gave birth to the national holiday to
help us continue our work _ to give us the means and encouragement
to complete the job we have just started.''
   The King commission was created on a temporary basis in 1984 as
part of a bill to make the civil rights leader's birthday a
national holiday. Because of opposition to the bill from some
conservative members of Congress, led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
funding plans for the commission were dropped in order to get the
bill passed.
   The commission's congressional mandate expires in April 1989,
and a bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., now before the
census and population subcommittee of the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee, would provide $300,000 in annual funding.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., a supporter of the Conyers bill,
said requests to the commission now outstrip what the group is able
to accomplish.
   ``The commission has more work than the meager resources it has
been able to raise from the private sector can begin to support,''
Weicker said.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., who chairs the House panel,
agreed and pledged to add an amendment to the legislation that
would increase funding to at least $500,000 per year.
   The commission processed more than 5,000 information requests
and helped 135 state and local governments plan holiday events in
1987, according to commission records.
   The Atlanta-based commission collected $183,552 in private
contributions in 1987, and has no paid employees, the records
showed.
   Nearly all money received went to producing newsletters and
pamphlets on King's life, said Lloyd Davis, the commission's
executive director. Staff assistance comes from federal employees
``loaned out'' from their agencies on a temporary basis, he said.
   By contrast, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United
States Constitution will receive $21 million in federal money this
year, while the United States Holocaust Memorial Council will
receive just over $2 million.
   ``We're talking about a desperate situation,'' Davis said. ``We
simply can't do it without some federal help.''
   Dymally said the bill should reach the full Post Office and
Civil Service Committee next week, and be considered on the House
floor in September.
   The holiday is officially celebrated on the third Monday in
January, which falls close to King's Jan. 15 birthday. The only
states that do not observe the date are Arizona, New Hampshire,
Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Idaho.
   Besides King, only George Washington and Abraham Lincoln have
their birthdays marked by national holidays.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. King revealed some of the plans for a second
March on Washington, to be held in commemoration of the historic
``I Have a Dream'' speech her husband delivered 25 years ago before
more than 200,000 civil rights activists in front of the Lincoln
Memorial.
   The celebration, scheduled for Aug. 27, will focus on
employment, housing and civil rights issues, she said.

   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered from the pulpit by
fellow clergymen Sunday as a man whose ``spiritual genius'' and
Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom.
   The official national holiday in his honor isn't until Monday,
but King was hailed in sermons and speeches Sunday, the day the
murdered civil rights leader would have turned 60.
   ``It's not just a one-day remembrance, but we need to remember
every day what he stood for and what he died for,'' the Rev. Clay
Evans, who worked with King, told worshipers at Fellowship Baptist
Church in Chicago. ``I think we have to make it not just a dream,
and not just make it a hollow day ... but a holy day.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, delivered her annual ``State of
the Dream'' speech to 1,200 people crammed into Atlanta's historic
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father were co-pastors.
   She urged President-elect George Bush to hold true to his call
for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' by imposing strict sanctions
against South Africa and providing direct financial support to
``black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in that
troubled land.''
   Mrs. King urged Bush to ``put behind the politics of the past''
by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable
housing, a stepped-up war on drugs and racial violence and the
appointment of federal judges ``who are as tough on discrimination
as they are on street crimes.''
   King, born Jan. 15, 1929, was assassinated April 4, 1968, at age
39 on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tenn. His killer, James
Earl Ray, is in prison.
   In 1983, after considerable debate, Congress approved creation of
a holiday to honor King on the third Monday in January. It was the
first holiday honoring a black American. The first official national
celebration was held in 1986.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday as well as a
federal holiday in all but a handful of states.
   Many cities and states planned their main celebration for Monday.
Bush planned to attend an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by
the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   King's birthday was to be observed at a number of other
celebrations in the capital, including a benefit and fashion show.
   In Michigan, a state senator was selected to ring the state's
Liberty Bell at the Capitol at 12:30 p.m. EST Monday. At the same
moment, bells at churches, schools and colleges throughout Michigan
will ring in memory of King. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, which
can no longer be rung, will be struck symbolically.
   In Selma on Monday, the first blacks on the Dallas County
Commission in more than a century will take the oath of office. It
was there that King began the historic 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But Sunday was a day in particular to remember King, who drew his
inspiration, his rhetoric and his philosophy from his Christian
faith, in churches.
   ``King was (a) man who was concerned about people regardless of
color and ethnic background,'' said the Rev. J. Allen Nimmo of the
Tenth Street Baptist Church in Camden, N.J.
   ``America should remember that Martin Luther gave his life that
we might live together,'' said Nimmo, who knew King and his family.
``The dream has not yet come true, but I think we are going to get
there. But we are going to have to struggle together.''
   Some who stopped to remember King this weekend had more personal
memories.
   ``He was a man who enjoyed a good laugh, missed his wife and
children when he was away, who got sad sometimes, who could be a
perfect friend,'' said Helen Maybell Anglin, who runs a restaurant
in Chicago. Another soul food restaurant of hers, the now-defunct
H&amp;H Cafe, which was one of King's favorite Chicago eateries.
   Even as supporters of King celebrated his spirit, some warned
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic. Others said that
racial bias is on the rise.
   ``There is a clear and present danger that the dream of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. is at risk of being derailed,'' the Rev.
Wyatt Tee Walker, chief of staff for King in the early 1960s.
   ``The establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us
into becoming comfortable with Martin Luther King,'' Walker told
worshipers at Riverside Church in New York City. He compared King to
Jesus and said King was ``the only authentic spiritual genius that
Western religion has produced.''
   Hazel Dukes, president of the New York state conference of
branches of the NAACP, said King ``would be very disappointed with
us.''
   ``He would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us
coming together, the races of people, Jews and gentiles, white and
black,'' she said.
   In a speech at a Harlem church to about 1,500 people, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson said that too many young blacks have a misconceived
notion of what their civil rights are. He chastised youngsters who
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs.
   ``That is a civil wrong. Dr. King did not die for your right to
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin. Stay the dream. Don't betray the
dream,'' Jackson said.

<TEXT>     It is on loan to Gavilan College from the university's Martin Luther King

Stanford.;    Leah Halper, a writer and journalism professor at Gavilan,
arranged for the exhibit to celebrate both King's birthday and Black History
Month in February.;    "Too often Black History Month goes unmarked," she
said. "It's important to acknowledge the contributions to society that
different groups have made.";    Halper learned of the traveling exhibit
through Stewart Burns, Stanford's associate editor of the King project, and
wanted to make it the focus of what might be Gavilan's first formal
celebration of Black History Month.;    "It's very important that everything
that has been gained in civil rights has been fought for and we need to
remember the people that did that," she said.;    "I think it's well worth the
drive up to Gavilan. I hope the people from the greater Gilroy, Morgan Hill
and Hollister areas come to see it.";    Using photographs, magazine articles
from the 1960s and documents from the permanent collection of King papers, the
traveling exhibit "tries to tell the story of the black freedom movement and
King," Burns said.;    Since this is perhaps Gavilan's first formal exhibit
for Black History Month, he said, "It's fitting they would have a really high
quality exhibit.";    He also said that the exhibit's title accurately
reflects the experience of African-Americans and others during King's era.;   
"We use 'black freedom movement or black freedom struggle,' " he said,
"because 'civil rights movement' doesn't do justice to the depth and
significance of the movement. It really was a movement for freedom.";    Plans
call for the exhibit to be available to Bay Area public and private schools,
from elementary through college levels. Public schools will be given top
priority, Burns said.;    Meanwhile, the project's main task, producing
volumes of King's speeches, sermons, writings, correspondence and other
papers, continues at Stanford.;    Initial volumes, Burns said, are scheduled
for publication by the University of California Press in 1992.; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTEDThe exhibit will be shown through Feb. 15 in the Gavilan library and
may be viewed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday-Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

<HEAD>Official King Holiday Wins Final Legislative Approval In Idaho</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation declaring the third Monday in
January an official state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
won final legislative approval today.
   Senate passage of the bill establishing the Martin Luther King
Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day removed Idaho from the dwindling list of
states still refusing to honor the slain civil rights leader with
an official holiday.
   The bill, clearing the Senate on a 28-11 vote, now goes to Gov.
Cecil Andrus, who called for its passage in his State of the State
address to open the session last January.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' said Sen. Mary Lou
Reed, a Democrat, citing the past four years since the state
designated the third Monday in January as a commemorative day for
King.
   Only three other states are now without King holidays _ Montana,
New Hampshire and Arizona.
   The Idaho measure, however, faced a somewhat rocky road in a
Legislature that has passed some of the toughest anti-racism laws
in the nation, including a criminal malicious harassment law and
mandatory hate-crime reporting.
   After winning initial Senate passage, it was sidetracked in the
House until a compromise was agreed to on the formal name. The
agreement added Idaho Human Rights Day to the designation.
   The holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in part to
offset the negative image the state has developed because of the
presence of white supremacists at the Aryan Nations compound of
Richard Butler in northern Idaho.
   But now with the new holiday and the laws enacted in past
sessions, Mrs. Reed said, ``We have the finest package of human
rights legislation in the nation.
   ``Richard Butler and his small band is just a pitiful bunch,''
she said. ``The Aryan Nations people are now moving into the states
of Wyoming and Montana.''
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between $100,000
and $2 million depending on whether payroll is considered, and
King's radical political background.
   Andrus said, however, that ``more than a holiday to honor one
man, it will be a day to honor all like him, who believe that no
person can truly be free when even one other person is denied
liberty.''

CITY CELEBRATES KING'S BIRTHDAY, ITS DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. descended on Parcher Plaza -- the heart of 
civic Glendale -- for the first time Monday, as about 80 city officials and 
employees celebrated the 61st birthday of the slain civil rights leader with an 
outdoor party. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. David Scott of the North Glendale United Methodist Church delivered a 
speech, calling for continued progress toward racial unity and citing King's 
famous "I Have a Dream" address. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale High School Chamber Choir opened the festivities with a soulful 
rendition of the national anthem and entertained the crowd after the speech. 
Volunteers served free turkey and ham sandwiches and potato and macaroni salad, 
and Mayor Jerold Milner read a proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the celebration mirrored hundreds of King festivities around 
the country. But for at least one Glendale minority employee, it was a special 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago it was uncomfortable for minorities to come into this city at 
any time, particularly in the evenings," said Glendale Community Relations 
Coordinator Rick Reyes, who has worked for the city for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today there are pockets of resistance, but the attitudes are slowly 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as three years ago, a black delicatessen owner left town after 
attacks by vandals who repeatedly smeared her store with racist graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the city quietly recognized King's day with a proclamation and a 
lunchtime movie in the basement of city hall.

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year, five years after Congress created a national holiday on Jan. 15 to 
commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, only four of 29 Orange County 
cities -- and the county itself -- have officially recognized the day and its 
meaning. At the rate additional cities join in, it will be well into the 21st 
Century before the holiday is given its just due. 
</P>
<P>
Congress made the birthday of the slain civil rights leader a holiday because 
he stood for justice and equality for all races. Those who lived through the 
days when King led nonviolent demonstrations to force the white society to come 
face to face with its own racism will never forget the role this eloquent and 
peaceful man played in national change. But, while the most virulent forms of 
racism have disappeared, there are still gains to be made for blacks in 
America, and in Orange County. As an indication of the non-acceptance of blacks 
here, their numbers have remained virtually stagnant for a decade, still 
numbering less than 30,000 of a population of more than 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Martin Luther King Day is not just for blacks. It also represents 
the struggle for equality of all people who come to America in search of 
freedom. In Orange County, this includes large communities of Vietnamese 
refugees and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Seal Beach added Martin Luther King Day to its list of employee 
holidays. The year before, Santa Ana joined the cities of Irvine and Huntington 
Beach, as well as Orange County, to celebrate the symbolic day. During this 
coming year, other cities should join with them so that, well before the turn 
of the century, it is a holiday observed by all in Orange County.

<TEXT>
   Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered in church services
nationwide Sunday on the eve of what would have been his 61st
birthday, and the slain civil rights leader's widow called on
President Bush to help unify America.
   Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of the dream''
address at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband was pastor,
before about 1,000 people, including such civil rights leaders as
the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Joseph Lowery.
   Mrs. King reflected on the dramatic social changes of 1989 in
other parts of the world and her husband's philosophy of civil
disobedience.
   ``The cataclysmic changes we have seen in Eastern Europe, in
China and in South Africa since last year have deep roots in this
very pulpit,'' she said.
   Mrs. King, noting that Bush is to deliver his State of the Union
address in a few days, recalled a State of the Union speech in the
1960s by then-President Johnson.
   Johnson ``captured the imagination of the American people just
by saying three little words, `We shall overcome,''' Mrs. King said.
   ``A quarter of a century later, President Bush has the same
opportunity,'' she said. ``He can help unify America if he will
break with the past by ending the arms race and working for
programs to provide jobs and educational opportunities for all
Americans.
   ``If he will avoid the kind of military entanglements that
destroyed (Johnson's) war on poverty, he can unify America and lead
the world to a higher destiny,'' Mrs. King said.
   Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban development,
presented Mrs. King with a large photograph of a Chinese student
standing in Beijing's Tiananmen Square holding a sign reading, ``We
Shall Overcome.''
   ``The dream lives on not only here, but throughout the world,''
Kemp said.
   Mrs. King called on King supporters to carry on her husband's
dream.
   ``Let's be clear that the future depends on us and our
determination to do God's will,'' she said. ``If you take nothing
else away from here today, let it be a conviction that you can make
a difference.''
   Earlier, Jackson, a former Democratic presidential contender and
former King aide, spoke to textile workers in Louisville in central
Georgia from the steps of the Jefferson County Courthouse within
sight of an old slave auction block.
   He urged all workers to stand up against their bosses for a
living wage and decent working conditions.
   ``As long as the plug is pulled and the lights are out, we're
all the same in the dark,'' Jackson said. ``Regardless of color,
hunger hurts.''
   In New York City, Mayor David Dinkins, the first black to hold
that office, told about 400 people at Judson Memorial Church about
King's struggle for equality and the need to continue.
   ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era,'' Dinkins said.
``It is up to us to push on into the bright light of day.
   ``Dr. King dreamed of an inclusive society, where people would
be judged by their good will and their good deeds,'' he said.
``That is my dream for our city.''
   In Cleveland, Roman Catholic Bishop Anthony M. Pilla presided at
an afternoon prayer service at St. John's Cathedral.
   The Rev. Howard Moody, senior minister at Judson Memorial,
expressed concern at Sunday's service that King's dream had not
been fulfilled.
   Racial strife shows that the ``dream has been deferred and we
haven't lived up to the promise,'' said Moody, who is white.
   ``Racism and prejudice is still alive and well in this country
despite everything he did,'' Moody said. ``I don't think white
people have lived up to what he hoped we would. He was betting
everything on us. He bet his life, finally, that we would change.''
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   King's teachings were honored Sunday in Miami as about 100 to
150 Haitian exiles staged a peaceful demonstration for democracy in
their Caribbean island nation. Demonstrators called for a halt in
U.S. aid to Gen. Prosper Avril's government and that Avril, on a
trade mission to Taiwan, be kept from returning home.
   For the first time, the holiday falls this year on King's actual
birthday, Jan. 15. There were plans in all 50 states and 144 other
countries for bells to ring and for a moment of silence in honor of
King at 12:30 p.m. EST. The New York Stock Exchange also planned to
pause, and the Liberty Bell was to ring in Philadelphia.
   In Los Angeles on Saturday, hundreds of volunteers, including
Mayor Tom Bradley, planted nearly 400 Canary Island Pine trees
along a seven-mile stretch of Martin Luther King Boulevard.
   At a banquet in King's honor at the University of Kansas in
Lawrence on Saturday, Martin Luther King III said his father's
dream is a long way from reality.
   ``The reality is that time has not arrived,'' King said. ``We
still have a long way to go ... to try to achieve his unfinished
work, to create a world where freedom, justice and equality becomes
reality to all mankind.''
   King said black enrollment in colleges has been declining, and
that black people are still denied advancement in business.
   King's birthday became the 10th national holiday in 1986.
   Forty-six states and the federal government mark the holiday.
The four states that do not recognize the federal holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire. Wyoming is observing the
holiday this year only.
   Arizona's holiday is on hold, and the state faces more months of
debate before voters settle the controversy in November. It began
when former Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a King holiday
by executive order in 1986 only to have it rescinded by his
successor, Republican Evan Mecham.
   According to a poll published by the Arizona Republic newspaper
Sunday, 71 percent of those surveyed would vote to repeal a law
passed by the Legislature that would set a holiday for King and do
away with Columbus Day.
   But when Columbus Day was eliminated as an issue, 49 percent of
the 808 respondents said they supported a King holiday in
principle, 40 percent opposed it and 11 percent said they did not
know.
   In Phoenix on Sunday, a supporter of the King holiday there said
efforts to stop the referendum went against what King stood for.
   ``You have to remember Dr. King's part of his movement was to
get people the right to vote so now that the `people' have said
`put it on the ballot' to circumvent them from voting would almost
go against some of the principles,'' said the Rev. Warren Stewart
Sr. ``So what we have to do is the more difficult task, and educate
people on why Martin King ought to have a holiday in Arizona.''

Dennis Ulysees, 31, a stonemason from Tacoma, Wash., stood in front of Martin

"He has never known segregation," continued Rogers, 39. "He has grown up in a 
privileged environment. I want to make certain he knows who he is and where he 
came from, that this man was responsible for the freedoms he has. I don't want 
him ever to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Every day people gather here in the heart of Atlanta's Sweet Auburn district to 
pay homage to King, who died April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., the victim of an 
assassin's bullet. But on this day, which would have been King's 60th birthday, 
thousands are expected to gather at the site's reflecting pool where his tomb 
is mounted on a pedestal. Inscribed on his crypt are King's words: "Free at 
last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last." 
</P>
<P>
The two-block-long national historic site was set aside by Congress in 1980 and 
has been administered since by the National Park Service. Its purpose is to 
protect and interpret for the benefit, inspiration and education of present and 
future generations the place where Martin Luther King Jr. was born, lived, 
worked and worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year 840,000 visitors came here, half black, half white," explained 
Randolph Scott, 58, a former Norfolk, Va., high school history teacher who has 
been the site's superintendent for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the site's points of interest: the home at 501 Auburn Ave. where King was 
born; his tomb a block away at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for 
Non-Violent Social Change, founded in 1968 and headed by his wife, Coretta 
Scott King; and Ebenezer Baptist Church, located two blocks from his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Father, Grandfather 
</P>
<P>
His father, Martin Luther King Sr., was pastor of the church from 1931 to 1975; 
his grandfather, A. D. Williams, presided from 1894 to 1931. Martin Luther King 
Jr. preached his first sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church when he was 17 and 
served as co-pastor with his father from 1960 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that his body lay in state and also where his mother, Alberta 
Williams King, was slain six years later as she played the organ during a 
religious service. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-story, 14-room Queen Anne clapboard home where King was born and 
lived until 1941, visitors are taken on a tour by ranger Shelly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people say they can feel Dr. King's spirit, feel his presence in this 
house," said Lewis, 30, of Bolton, Miss. "Many visitors get quite emotional. 
They break down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Also born there were his brother, A. D., who drowned in a swimming pool 
accident in 1969, and his sister, Christine King Farris, a professor at 
Atlanta's Spelman College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Belongings 
</P>
<P>
The home contains the family's original furniture, including the piano King 
played as a boy, his baseball glove, Monopoly game, family icebox and washing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Auburn was a mecca of Atlanta's leading black business and commercial 
enterprises and a middle-class black residential area when Martin Luther King 
lived here," site superintendent Scott said. The Park Service now owns 13 
turn-of-the-century homes and buildings in 21.5-acre site and plans to acquire 
27 more, he said. Seven have already been restored to their original state. 
</P>
<P>
Among the area's buildings is Atlanta's famed Royal Peacock Club where Duke 
Ellington, Billy Eckstein, Louis Armstrong and other well-known black 
entertainers performed. John Wesley Dobbs, grandfather of former Atlanta Mayor 
Maynard H. Jackson, is credited with giving the area its nickname, Sweet 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
At the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change, the Park 
Service operates a museum filled with memorabilia and photographs highlighting 
the life of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
On display are the Nobel Peace Prize he received as well as the Medal of 
Freedom, his clothing, clerical robes and favorite neckties. Behind glass is 
the key to Room 307 at the Lorraine Hotel where King was killed, the wallet he 
was carrying when shot, his handwritten sermons and well-worn Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important to my mother, my brother and my two sisters is the 
ever-growing interest in my father and what he worked for in his lifetime," 
said Martin Luther King III, 31, a Fulton County, Ga., commissioner. "I hope 
and pray it will continue to grow with his memory helping to achieve justice 
and equality for all mankind."

SOME WORKERS MUST MARK THE HOLIDAY ON THEIR OWN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Early Monday morning Zack Harmon called his workplace to say he would be out 
sick. Hours later, though, Harmon appeared to be in suspiciously good health. 
He stood with his 2-year-old son perched upon his shoulder and watched the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade flow down King Boulevard in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Like Harmon, many Los Angeles workers and students were forced to feign illness 
or expend vacation days or accumulated time off Monday in order to participate 
in the observance of what would have been the civil rights leader's 61st 
birthday. Though the third Monday in January was designated a federal holiday 
honoring King in 1986, many offices and some private schools still remained 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon echoed the sentiments of other absentees who could be found along the 
parade route when he explained his decision not to report to work. It is 
important, he said, to commemorate a man and a movement that "changed the face 
of the whole nation. That's why I'm here and that's why he's here," he said, 
indicating his son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a financial analyst, said calling in sick was the only way he could get 
the day off, and that his employers were aware of the ruse and accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I was sick, but they know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said their bosses are less benign. They described personal battles to 
persuade school officials and employees to recognize the day. 
</P>
<P>
M. Jeremy McCauley, an analyst at McDonnell Douglas, said he was was appalled 
when he read the latest company newsletter. Across the top ran a line in bold 
print informing employees that Jan. 15 was to be "a regular working day." 
</P>
<P>
"I was burned up by that," he said. "The inference is that it is not as 
deserving as any other holiday . . . enough so that they put it in the 
newsletter." 
</P>
<P>
To observe the day, McCauley would have had to use a vacation day, a sick day 
or a personal day. He decided to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's no big deal. It's no special day and I don't understand that. It 
shows little respect or concern for Dr. King." 
</P>
<P>
Incensed, McCauley already has begun writing a letter to the company newspaper 
detailing his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hanson, spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said company holidays are 
negotiated with the union. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has 13 holidays a year and King Day is not one of those that they 
chose to put in, at least not so far," he said. Hanson also noted that many 
company holidays have been consolidated so employees have a week off from 
Christmas through New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have given employees the option of using a floating holiday to 
observe the day. Barbara Hughes, an employee at Warner Brothers, used a 
floating holiday to observe King Day. But Hughes feels that is a way of 
sidestepping the issue. Going to the parade was her way of "making a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to maybe show management that we as employees at Warner Brothers should 
have (King Day) as a holiday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Friedman, company spokesman, said King Day was not a union holiday, so the 
studios were open. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Brummell, a sales clerk at Sears, used a personal day off she had saved. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave his life, so I can at least take one day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To Elimu Kiongozi, an aerospace employee who could be found at work Monday, the 
sanctioning of the holiday by schools and officials is less important than 
African-Americans acknowledging the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We should just take the day off whether The Man is going to let us or not . . 
. even if it costs us," said Kiongozi, adding that other leaders like Malcolm X 
and Marcus Garvey should have days of commemoration in the African-American 
community as well. 
</P>
<P>
While the holiday was observed by public schools and universities, some 
students of private schools found themselves engaged in the controversy over 
observing the day. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at Occidental College, classes were held Monday, but many of the 
school's students chose to attend an anti-apartheid rally at the South African 
Consulate as a way of observing King's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
A candlelight vigil was held Monday night as the students' first organized 
attempt to convince the administration that the day should be a school holiday. 
Frances Hill, the school's news director, said Occidental is on the quarter 
system and does not observe other holidays such as President's Day. The 
school's administration is sympathetic to the request of students to observe 
the day, she added.

ECHOES OF STRIFE HAUNT U.S. ON KING'S BIRTHDAY

Church bells across the country tolled the loss of Martin Luther King Jr. today 
as echoes of the racial conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to 
overcome continued to haunt the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, worshipers at King's church were urged on the slain civil rights 
leader's birthday to keep alive his memory and his philosophy of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man who is a deep current in our memory," said the Rev. Cecil 
Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco. 
"Let us live then not only his dream, but let us live the practice of 
nonviolence and unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
Church services, parades and other celebrations were held nationwide during the 
weekend before the federal holiday, which for the first time falls on the slain 
civil-rights leader's actual birthday. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been 61 today. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Mayor Tom Bradley observed the holiday today by ringing the 
City Hall bell three times. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, meanwhile, demonstrated at the 
downtown headquarters of Security Pacific Bank to protest the bank's decision 
to stay open on the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned today in Atlanta was a "March of Celebration" parade, being 
televised nationally for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats, apparently 
racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flare-up of racial tensions in 
Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white man had claimed that a black 
mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife. 
</P>
<P>
It also comes at a time of gains for blacks -- the election of David N. 
Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's first elected 
black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the world," said James 
Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial Equality, as he pounded three times 
with his fist on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. "Those who have been denied 
liberty love it most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, one of just four states without some form of King holiday, 
thousands marched in Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed 
crowd carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown Phoenix as 
they headed for a rally at the Capitol.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, a day away from his party's
presidential nomination, invoked the memory of Martin Luther King
Jr. Tuesday and pledged to work to ``inspire and uplift this
country.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat and his designated running mate,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, received a tour of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center from the civil rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King.
   Earlier, Dukakis, his wife, Kitty, and adviser Paul Brountas had
breakfast in the candidate's hotel suite with AFL-CIO president
Lane Kirkland and his wife, Irena.
   Dukakis' aides, sensitive to accusations that labor wields too
much influence in the Democratic Party, did not list the breakfast
session on his schedule.
   An AFL-CIO spokesman called the breakfast ``routine.''
   ``I'm sure what they talked about was how to win in November,''
said federation spokesman Rex Hardesty.
   Dukakis was spending most of the day in his suite working with
speechwriter Bill Woodward on the address he will deliver Thursday
when he accepts the presidential nomination.
   He met for nearly an hour with the Democrats' Hispanic members
of Congress, a meeting they said Dukakis asked for. Rep. Albert
Bustamante of Texas said they talked about involving Hispanics in
the campaign and in the transition team, if Dukakis is elected.
   ``He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the
Hispanic community in Congress,'' said Bustamante. ``We were real
pleased.''
   While the convention wound up its debate on the platform,
Dukakis attended a closed fund-raiser in a downtown office
building. Accompanying the Massachusetts governor was his cousin,
Academy Award-winning actress Olympia Dukakis.
   The last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the
day with announcement that aides to Dukakis and Jesse Jackson had
reached agreement on most platform differences.
   With Mrs. King leading the way, Dukakis and Bentsen and their
wives looked at exhibits at the King Center.
   The first one they stopped at contained mementos of the passage
of legislation establishing a national holiday commemorating King's
birthday, Jan. 15.
   One of the exhibits was a photograph of President Reagan signing
the legislation. It included an inscription, ``To Coretta King.
With respect and high esteem on a very special day.'' It was
signed, ``George Bush.''
   The Republican vice president is Dukakis' certain opponent in
the fall election.
   Other exhibits included the key to Room 307 at the Lorraine
Motel in Memphis, Tenn. King was standing on the balcony outside
that room when he was shot and killed in 1968.
   The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to King, as well as the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded him posthumously, also were
displayed.
   The final stop on the tour was King's tomb, inscribed, ``Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. 1929 - 1968. Free at last, Free at last,
Thank God almighty I'm free at last.''
   In a brief speech that included several quotations from King,
Dukakis described the slain civil rights leader as ``a man of
action, he was a man of inspiration.''
   Bentsen was nearby, and Dukakis said that if elected he and his
vice president ``are going to do our very best, with your support,
to inspire and uplift this country.''
   Dukakis praised the convention keynote speech by Texas State
Treasurer Ann Richards and noted that neither he nor Bentsen ``have
ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory.''
   Then he added, ``And after Jesse gets through tonight, none of
us will meet the standard Ann Richards and Jesse Jackson set for
this convention.''
   Jackson was the featured convention speaker Tuesday night.

   James Meredith, whose enrollment as
the first black at the University of Mississippi sparked rioting in
1962, now is fighting white liberals instead of white supremacists.
   ``I was engaged in a war and the only thing that has changed is
the enemy,'' Meredith told reporters Sunday on the eve of the
national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr.
   ``When we went to Mississippi my enemy was the white
supremacists. My enemy now is the white liberal.''
   His enrollment at Ole Miss resulted in riots that were
suppressed by federal troops. But he since has called integration
``the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.''
   Meredith said he never considered himself a part of the
civil-rights movement.
   ``That's always been an insult to me,'' he said.
   Meredith blamed many of society's ills on a ``liberal elite,''
which he said wants to keep blacks in a second-class position under
the pretext of helping them.
   Meredith surprised civil-rights activists in September when he
went to work as an adviser to arch-conservative Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.,
   Since Helms' election to the Senate in 1972, he has vigorously
opposed civil-rights legislation and other domestic programs
favored by many blacks.
   Meredith, speaking to reporters before an address at Mount
Holyoke College, had little to say about King or Helms' opposition
to creating of the King holiday.
   ``The issue is not about Martin Luther King's birthday being a
national holiday,'' he said. ``The issue is about the Martin Luther
King holiday commission.''
   Helms has opposed funding for the federal commission Congress
set up to promote the holiday. He says establishing such a
commission for one individual sets a bad precedent.

   The youngest son of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. has resigned as president of the center that
carries his father's name amid talk of a rift among the leadership
over the center's direction.
   Dexter King's resignation was announced Thursday by the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, but no reason
was given.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said King stepped down because
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were
reports of a rift between King and his mother, Coretta Scott King.
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams said the center was
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which the elder
King founded.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. King,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' said Williams, a former
lieutenant of the elder King. ``When they started talking about
leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing,
and both got hurt.''
   Mayor Andrew Young, who was an aide to the elder King in the
'60s, was quoted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying the
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   A King Center official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Mrs. King might return to the presidency she relinquished to
her son.
   The King Center is a non-profit organization devoted to
education about King's teachings and philosophy. It also urges
action on international racial issues, especially apartheid in
South Africa, and is host to the annual Martin Luther King Jr.
birthday week celebration.
   The SCLC has taken an activist approach to the problems of
poverty and racism since it was founded in 1957 by King and the
Revs. Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement,'' Lowery has said.
``When you do that, you step on toes and you don't become the most
popular kid on the block.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a follower of King in the 1960s and a
former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said
in a telephone interview from Chicago that the two groups are
complementary rather than competitive.
   ``The fact that Dr. King remains a frame of reference for
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized,''
Jackson said, referring to the center.
   ``The SCLC's legacy (is) direct action, challenging the racism,
challenging anti-semitism,'' he added.
   Dexter King, 28, was elected in January to take over from his
mother, who remained as chief executive officer. He said he wanted
to cut the center's dependency on donations and put it on a solid
financial base so it could ``market and disseminate'' non-violent
teachings.
   King could not be reached at the office of his business,
Visionary Development Corp.
   In a statement from the King Center, board Chairman Jesse Hill
Jr. did not address the reasons for King's decision.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill wrote.
   The King Center, on Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue, contains a
museum and Martin Luther King Jr.'s tomb.

   The ouster of Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, who
canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader Martin
Luther King Jr., was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating
King's assassination 20 years ago.
   Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery
announced Mecham's conviction by the Arizona Senate Monday at the
awards dinner that night.
   About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights
anthem, ``We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background.
   ``I hate to rejoice,'' Lowery said, ``but I feel good about this
... We did overcome. Justice has been served.''
   Mecham was removed from office 20 years to the day that King,
who founded the SCLC, was shot to death in Memphis, Tenn.
   Mayor Andrew Young, an aide to King and an ordained
Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse:
``Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''
   In Altamont, Utah, meanwhile, where Mecham grew up, his removal
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances.
   ``It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been
blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin Ona Rust of
Altamont. ``I'm very disappointed in the people of Arizona.''
   Mecham graduated from Altamont High School in 1942 and moved
away after joining the service in 1943. He is scheduled to address
the high school's commencement ceremony May 27.
   A former classmate, Beverly Fieldsted, who was one year behind
Mecham in high school, said Mecham's removal must stem from a
misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent.
   Mecham canceled a King holiday for state workers on Jan. 12,
1987, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by
some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock
groups.
   He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
official actions or offhand remarks.
   Among other things, he defended the use of the word
``pickaninny'' for black children.
   ``I think Gov. Mecham exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of
spirit,'' Lowery said in an interview. ``I think it had to be a
corruption of spirit in order to insult Martin Luther King and the
birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, stood thoughtfully after being
told of Mecham's impeachment, and declined to comment.
   The SCLC dinner was held to present the group's annual Martin
Luther King Jr. Memorial Drum Major for Justice Awards.

RACE RELATIONS: PAST SNUBS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. HAVE MADE AMERICA'S FINEST 
CITY MORALLY INELIGIBLE TO TAKE THE SPORTING EVENT AWAY FROM ARIZONA.

Less than two weeks ago, the best way to define the Yiddish word chutzpah was 
to tell the story about the child who did away with his parents, then appealed 
for leniency because he was an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
But on Nov. 7, the kid was outdone by San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, San 
Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos and the entire San Diego Super Bowl Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
When the National Football League moved to shift the 1993 Super Bowl out of 
Phoenix after Arizona voters rejected a referendum establishing a state holiday 
on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, San Diego leaders, ignoring our 
city's shameful behavior concerning the slain civil rights leader, appealed to 
the NFL to award the big game to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine the track record of America's Finest City over the last several 
years, beginning in 1986 when the San Diego City Council, in a highly 
controversial move, changed the name of Market Street to Martin Luther King 
Way. Almost immediately, a coalition arose to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, San Diegans voted overwhelmingly to strip King's name off 
the downtown thoroughfare and return the original name. 
</P>
<P>
The council then revived the issue by announcing that it was looking for 
another way to honor King. It voted to name the city's new waterfront 
convention center for him and called on the Port Commission to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The move seemed assured because the city's three appointees to the commission, 
plus National City's representative, said publicly that they would comply. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Larsen, one of San Diego's three appointees, changed his mind and 
switched his vote, scuttling another tribute to King. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter feelings about the whole ugly incident had subsided until two days 
before Election Day, when a television sportscaster told the world that Super 
Bowl XXVII might be moved to another site unless Arizonans voted in favor of 
the King holiday referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The threat revived the possibility that San Diego, a loser in the bidding for 
the 1993 Super Bowl, might get another shot at the game and affected the 
Arizona election, some believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that moment," said Bill Shover, a leading supporter of the King measure, 
"we had a 14% to 18% lead. But then came that CBS report and people here felt 
threatened. There's a lot of Barry Goldwater attitude in this state. 
Independence. Frontier independence." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hudgins, president of the Martin Luther King Better America Committee, 
added, "I think Sunday's report held a gun to the collective head of the 
Arizona electorate, which turned around and told them what to do with the Super 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the polls closed and the "nays" won by less than 1% of the 1.1 
million votes cast, the San Diego appeal, in the form of a letter from 
O'Connor, was sent to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego isn't alone. The Rose Bowl, another runner-up to Phoenix in the 
competition for Super Bowl XXVII, also wants to host the game. But as far as I 
know, Pasadena hasn't insulted King's memory the way San Diego has. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there's no telling how this will end or where the January, 1993, game 
will eventually be played. 
</P>
<P>
What does matter is that San Diego was hypocritical enough to even suggest that 
this particular game be moved here. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a loyal San Diegan and Charger fan. The money and national exposure that 
the game would bring -- Super Bowl XXII generated $125 million here in 1988 -- 
would be good for the city. I would love nothing more than to see another Super 
Bowl game played here. 
</P>
<P>
But not this game. San Diego doesn't deserve The Chutzpah Bowl any more than 
the newly orphaned child deserved leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tagliabue and Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., I 
don't believe that the Super Bowl should be played in a state that has formally 
rejected naming a holiday for King. 
</P>
<P>
And in much the same way, football would be making a horrible mistake if it 
awards the 1993 game to a city that has consistently bent over backward not to 
honor this man who sought to achieve full civil rights for all.

<HEAD>Idaho Legislature Approves King Holiday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
won final approval in the Legislature on Friday, making Idaho the
47th state agreeing to adopt the federal holiday.
   Senate passage of the measure on a 28-11 vote assured it of
becoming law with Gov. Cecil Andrus' promised approval.
   The vote was one of the Legislature's last acts before
adjourning for the year, and came four years after the state
designated the third Monday in January as a commemorative day but
not an official holiday for King.
   Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana also have refused to
designate a holiday.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' Sen. Mary Lou Reed
said. ``We have the finest package of human rights legislation in
the nation.''
   The Legislature has passed some of the toughest laws in the
nation against racial harassment and discrimination. But the King
holiday, after winning initial Senate passage, was sidetracked in
the House.
   Final passage came when the Senate agreed to a House amendment
to call the holiday Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day.
   A black community leader, the Rev. Ellis Robinson of St. Paul
Baptist Church in Boise, said the action extended the holiday
beyond King to ``anyone who's ever struggled and worked for the
rights of others.''
   ``We're not looking at this as a victory for black people,''
Robinson said. ``We're looking at it as a victory for all people.''
   The King holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in
part to offset the negative image the state has developed because
of the presence of white supremacists at the Aryan Nations compound
of Richard Butler in the state's panhandle.
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between $100,000
and $2 million, depending on whether payroll is considered.

<TEXT>     San Francisco police Lt. Gerald McCarthy said late Monday that police had
no suspects in the slaying. Although three young men were taken into custody
at the scene, McCarthy said they were released after questioning.;    McCarthy
said an argument between two groups of young men apparently preceded the 2:15
p.m. killing. But he said it was unclear whether Miller was part of the
argument. Miller, he said, was shot once in the chest.;    Later in the day,
San Francisco police delayed the departure of two southbound trains while
searching the Martin Luther King Day Freedom Train for youths who had robbed
another youth of his coat at gunpoint.;    McCarthy said the robbery report
was not linked to the shooting at the Civic Auditorium.;    Capt. Michael
Yarov and a team of at least 10 officers escorted three young men into custody
just before 5 p.m. at the CalTrain station at Fourth and Townsend streets.;   
According to police, the robbery victim, who was not injured, got off the
train in San Francisco and told officials that a group of youths held him at
gunpoint and took his coat.;    The violence came on a day when people at the
rally repeatedly expressed the wish for peace so often echoed by King.;    At
the day's start, at the Cahill Station in San Jose, the air was charged with
enthusiasm and anticipation as thousands gathered to board the sixth annual
Freedom Train bound for San Francisco and a celebration of King's birthday.;  
 "I'm here because this is one way I can find out about my culture," said
Malinda West, a senior at St. Andrew High.;    Among the estimated 5,000
aboard the train was 11-year-old Jimmy Cates, a sixth-grader from Bret Harte
Junior High School in San Jose who had recently written a biography on the
civil rights leader.;    "I want to hear people talk about Dr. King," he
said.;    It was the fifth Freedom Train ride for 81-year-old Veronica Jesse
of San Jose.;    "It's like a little vacation for me," said the petite senior
citizen who leans slightly and walks with a cane.;    Jesse and the other
riders were greeted by the Rev. Martin Grizzel at the Civic Auditorium.;   
"Brother Martin is shining down on us right now, and he is applauding us from
another land right now," he said to the 5,000 people who packed the
auditorium. About 1,000 others stayed outside the auditorium.;    Most of
those at the celebration had taken part in an orderly march through city
streets, and many marchers carried signs calling for an end to war in the
Persian Gulf.;    Jesse was accompanied by 11-year-old Nicole King and her
mother, Pam Burrell. Both were part of a community group called PACE, designed
to aid the elderly, and had been assigned to help Jesse along the trip. "I
like taking care of people," said Nicole, as she sipped a lemon-lime soda.;   
Only the news that the teen had been shot during the celebration seemed to
dampen her enthusiasm as she shook her head slowly.;    "It's too bad. It's a
pity," said Burrell. She said they heard nothing of the commotion that took
place upstairs where the shooting had occurred.;    The turnout at San
Francisco's sixth annual official observance of King's birthday was one of the
largest in the country. In Oakland, more than 500 people took part in a march
and rally.;    The San Francisco march began in the predominantly black Bay
View-Hunters Point area, with about 2,000 participants. Marchers walked four
miles to the railroad station to meet the Freedom Train riders, then headed
six blocks on Market Street to the auditorium.;    Organizers said the San
Francisco march was primarily dedicated to King's life, but others broadened
the focus to include statements against the Persian Gulf war.;    In contrast
to last week's spirited anti-war demonstrations during which participants
occasionally clashed violently with police, the march proceeded peacefully
with about a dozen officers on motorcycles and four or five squad cars
escorting the crowd.  </TEXT>

CALIFORNIA 94 RENAMED TO HONOR MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-mile stretch of California 94, from downtown San Diego to its interchange 
with California 125 in La Mesa, was formally christened Monday as the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-and-white signs, each 14 feet long by 3 1/2 feet wide, along the 
state route were unveiled Monday at a press conference officially acknowledging 
the name change, San Diego's latest effort to find a permanent memorial for the 
slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the memorial issue has thrust the city in a racially and 
politically divisive debate. The renaming of the freeway has been one of the 
least favorite choices of San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, a black community leader who has fought to have the 
San Diego Convention Center named for King, said at the unveiling that, 
although he supports renaming the freeway, he isn't satisfied, and that San 
Diego must still deal with what he called racism and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the San Diego City Council decided against seeking a name 
change for California 94 and instead voted to designate Market Street as Martin 
Luther King Way. But, a year later, San Diego voters rescinded that decision by 
overwhelmingly approving a referendum that restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, a private group, led by members of the Chamber of Commerce, 
worked with black leaders to find another replacement, settling on a 
scholarship fund and King statue to be built in Balboa Park. Fund raising for 
the $750,000 goal has stalled at about $150,000, civic leaders said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Also attempting to move ahead was the City Council, which called on the Board 
of Port Commissioners to name the new convention center in King's honor, a 
recommendation pushed by the King Tribute Advisory Board. The group held a 
series of eight poorly attended public hearings before voting on its 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
By last July, the port board decided by a 4-3 vote to keep King's name off the 
center, which opens to the public Friday as the San Diego Convention Center. A 
Stevens-led group has promised to protest and picket the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that vote that Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state 
Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) introduced a resolution asking the 
Legislature to rename California 94. The Legislature approved the request in 
September, specifying, however, that private donations be used to pay for the 
new signs. 
</P>
<P>
The Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee was formed to raise the money. Its 
chairman is Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God in 
Christ on Imperial Avenue. Sharing the leadership of the group are Gordon C. 
Luce, chairman of Great American Bank; Kim Fletcher, chairman of HomeFed Bank, 
and Deddeh. 
</P>
<P>
The group has raised $1,400 of the $2,700 needed for the signs, according to a 
committee spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Arizona House Passes Martin Luther King Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona House of Representatives has approved
a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state
Senate.
   The bill, which would designate the third Monday of each January
as ``Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day,'' passed the House in a
35-24 vote Thursday.
   Democrat Carolyn Walker, the chief Senate sponsor, said there may
be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.
   ``I have a, shall we say, gut feeling that this may be the
year,'' she said.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who supports the King holiday,
issued a statement congratulating the House.
   ``I now appeal to the Senate for similar, non-divisive passage of
the King legislation so that I may sign it and together we can move
Arizona forward,'' she said.
   Former Republican Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached last spring
for attempting to thwart a death-threat investigation and misusing
funds, drew fire in 1987 for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a
move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that

   Martin Luther King Jr. ``would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs'' if he were living,
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan said today at an observance
of the slain civil rights leader's birthday.
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' Lujan told an overflow crowd in the 850-seat
auditorium of the Interior Department.
   ``There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug
use,'' he said. ``Martin Luther King would not stand for drug use
and neither should we.''
   ``Part of our commitment to educating young Americans must
include programs to discourage them from the deadly scourge of
drugs,'' Lujan told the audience.
   ``If Dr. King were alive today, he would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the next
generation from destroying itself,'' he said.
   C.T. Vivian, a former member of King's staff who now heads the
Black Action Strategies and Information Center, told the crowd in
which black people were in a slight preponderance, ``We would not
be meeting in this room right now if it were not for Martin King.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said Vivian. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''
   Later, a slightly smaller crowd gathered for a wreath-laying
ceremony outside the Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his
celebrated ``I have a dream'' speech in the climax of a civil
rights march in 1963.
   James M. Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, told
the group, ``The sound of Dr. King's words still rings in our ears.
As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his
presence.''
   King, leader of the black civil rights movement in America, was
shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis. James Earl Ray is serving
a life sentence for the slaying. King's birthday is being observed
Monday as a federal holiday. He was born Jan. 15, 1929.

CAN WE FINALLY HONOR DR. KING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the 60th birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. draws near, the San 
Diego City Council has the opportunity to give the slain civil rights leader an 
early birthday present by voting Tuesday to name the city's new convention 
center for him. 
</P>
<P>
If the San Diego Unified Port District, which is building the convention 
center, also approves the name, San Diego will have gone a long way toward 
clearing the debris of the citizen initiative that stripped King's name from a 
major downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's checkered history in trying to establish a public tribute to 
King, there will still be those who try to persuade the council and the port 
commissioners that the convention center is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the commission should ignore those voices. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasing everyone is not the point. There is no building or street that would 
not generate criticism. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is that the country's seventh-largest city has no major 
public tribute to the man who probably did more for civil rights than anyone 
since Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for San Diego's leaders to show some of the conviction of the 
man they are trying to honor. 
</P>
<P>
Already, too much time has passed; King was slain in 1968. Already, the city 
has earned an embarrassing reputation for racism. Two attempts to name streets 
here for King have failed; first, when the council rejected a proposal to 
rename part of Euclid Avenue and 54th Street, and again when the voters 
reversed the council's decision to rename Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to name the convention center for King was made by a 
council-appointed citizens committee that worked for almost a year, holding 
hearings throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the Port District should wholeheartedly endorse the committee's 
recommendation -- and not dilute it by using only King's last name, as 
Councilman Wes Pratt suggested in an attempt to fend off opposition. 
</P>
<P>
We also urge the council to approve a Chamber of Commerce proposal to establish 
a memorial to King in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the memorials would make a strong statement that the city recognizes 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s profound and courageous contribution to this and every 
community.

<HEAD>World to Celebrate King Day Amid Democracy Triumphs, Bomb Violence</HEAD>

   Pro-democracy demonstrations around the world and
fear gripping the Southeast after recent mail bombings are adding
meaning to this year's celebrations honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
   Bells in 144 countries and the 50 United States will ring out
simultaneously and Wall Street will pause for a moment of silence
Monday on what would have been the slain civil-rights leader's 61st
birthday.
   For the first time, King's birthday will be celebrated on a
large scale in white-ruled South Africa. A weeklong celebration
will climax Jan. 20, when about 10,000 people are expected at a
Johannesburg event honoring black leaders including Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak.
   In this country, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire have not
recognized the day as a state holiday. But organizers said bells
will ring in those states, and in the 47 states with King holidays,
at 12:30 p.m. EST, when the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia is tapped.
   In King's hometown of Atlanta, the center of King Week
celebrations, the 1990 holiday comes amid death threats that
followed last month's mail bombings of civil rights and judicial
targets in three Southeastern states.
   ``With the Klan and the mail bombs, this year it has a more
special meaning for everybody,'' said state Sen. Arthur Langford,
who portrays King in a yearly production of Langford's play ``Life
of a King.''
   ``People must understand that, in the words of Dr. King, we must
learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish
together as fools.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said she will try to deflect
attention from the racial violence.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said last week in announcing the week's events.
``It needs to be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with in the
proper manner.''
   Mrs. King said she instead would emphasize pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe.
   ``The same philosophy, strategy and tactics of non-violence that
we used to break down the walls of segregation are now being used
to tear down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain,'' she said.
   King Week 1990, sponsored by the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change and the King Federal Holiday Commission, culminates
Monday, the first time the holiday has fallen on King's actual
birthday.
   King led a non-violent movement for racial equality in the 1950s
and 1960s that led to passage of federal legislation ending
official discrimination and segregation. He was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
   In addition to the three states without King holidays, an
official King Day in Arizona is on hold. Wyoming's will be
celebrated for the first time, but only this year.
   In Arizona, Gov. Rose Mofford last fall signed into law a bill
to create a paid state holiday. But opponents filed petitions
calling for a referendum, keeping the law from becoming effective
until the vote. A King Day breakfast in Phoenix, however, is
expected to draw 1,500.
   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan bucked the wishes of the
Republican-controlled Legislature and issued an executive order
calling for the holiday. However, the order only applies this year.
   Events scheduled in Atlanta this year include the unveiling of a
sculpture at the King memorial center and a speech by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   A parade along Peachtree Street will conclude Monday's events
and will be nationally televised for the first time.
   Stoney Johnson, King Center media director, said security will
not be increased during any of the center's King Week activities
despite the mail bombs.
   ``It's so intense anyway that we don't need any more,'' he said.
   But Danny Levitan, executive director of the Center for
Democratic Renewal, which tracks hate group activity, warned that
violence may erupt in Atlanta just after King Day and the rest of
the nation ``should expect some attempts to disrupt events or
commit acts of violence'' Monday.
   On Jan. 20, Mississippi white supremacist Richard Barrett plans
a protest on National Park Service property across from King's
crypt in Atlanta. Park Service lawyers are reviewing the plan but
are expected to grant Barrett a permit, agency spokesman Paul
Winegar said.

   Communities planned celebrations and other events Monday to honor
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., including a
candlelight peace march in suburban Detroit and an anti-apartheid
demonstration in California.
   King's birthday will be observed as a federal holiday Monday in
all but six states, including Arizona, where it will be business as
usual at state offices.
   In New York City, a mural painted by high school students
depicting non-violence was unveiled Friday, and Mayor Edward Koch
mayor spoke of the ``grace and glory'' King brought to the United
States.
   In Michigan, the celebrations ``help us keep Dr. King's dream
alive and provide opportunities for all people to renew their
commitment to work for a society in which there is one standard of
equality and human rights,'' said state Sen. Jackie Vaughn.
   John Roy Castillo, director of the Michigan Civil Rights
Commission, said King's legacy has helped advance racial equality.
   ``Tremendous progress has been made over the last 20 to 25
years,'' he said Friday. ``There are more minorities who are elected
officials, there are more minority businesses, more professionals.''
   But he noted the high poverty and school dropout rate among
minorities.
   A symposium was planned Sunday and Monday at the University of
Michigan to honor King's work. Willie L. Brown, Jr., speaker of the
California Assembly, was to give the keynote address Sunday and
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a close associate of King's, was
scheduled to speak Monday.
   The end of King day will be marked by a candlelight peace march
at Roeper City and Country School in Bloomfield Hills, a wealthy
northern suburb of Detroit.
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., 26 teen-agers moved into the South
African consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protest to
mark King's birthday.
   The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to
19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office,
singing songs such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and other protest
anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering.
   They said they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when
fellow protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate
King's birthday and to denounce South Africa's system of racial
segregation.
   The mural unveiled Friday at the Bronx Regional High School in
New York City was inspired after a student at the school was killed
in 1987. Ten students painted, kept journals and did research about
non-violence for the 10-month project.
   ``This is a world they'd like to change and make more peaceful,''
said Mark Weiss, the school principal.
   The mural depicts Indian peace leader Mohandas Gandhi, King, a
sign saying ``end segregation in public schools'' and two hands
shaking, one black, one white.
   In Arizona, federal and city offices will be closed Monday but
all state offices will remain open.
   King's birthday was a state holiday in Arizona for a brief time.
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, created the holiday by
executive order in 1986 after the Legislature refused to act. But,
as one of his first official acts as governor, Evan Mecham rescinded
the order before the first holiday could be celebrated. The action
touched off the first major controversy of his short-lived
administration.
   Mecham said he acted because Attorney General Bob Corbin, a
fellow Republican, had said that Babbitt's order was illegal because
a holiday requires legislative approval as well.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who succeeded Mecham following his
impeachment and removal from office last year, is on record in favor
of a King holiday, although she has not followed Babbitt in creating
one by executive order.

VANDALS MARK HOLIDAY BY DEFACING SIGNS BEARING DR. KING'S NAME ON 94 FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
On the day honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., vandals spray-painted a 
swastika and racial graffiti Monday on California 94 freeway signs carrying the 
slain civil rights leader's name. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of California 94 was christened in 
King's honor Nov. 20, the letters KKK were painted across one of the signs on 
the westbound side of the freeway near the Lemon Grove exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two signs were painted with the letters SWP, which police believe 
stand for Supreme White Power, and with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about 9 a.m. 
on the east side of the freeway near Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. Fred England said. 
</P>
<P>
The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring 
Street exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Walker Smith, pastor of the Christ United Presbyterian Church 
and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You 
can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to King has been 
a sore point for San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Board of Port Commissioners, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the City 
Council's request to name the convention center after King. The San Diego 
Convention Center opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four 
new signs on California 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, who led the convention center fight, denounced the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the 
elected leadership in San Diego has not taken a position on this. The 
leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should 
come out and condemn this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God on Imperial 
Avenue, was chairman of the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee, which was 
formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of the freeway after King is the last of several official attempts 
to find a place to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the City Council voted against naming California 94 for King 
and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year 
later, voters rejected Martin Luther King Way and restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that battle, members of the Chamber of Commerce worked with 
black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in Balboa 
Park, which hasn't been erected. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, following the Port District's decision on the convention 
center, the Legislature approved renaming California 94 at the urging of 
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula 
Vista). But the Legislature stipulated that private donations be used to pay 
for the new signs.

<HEAD>King Assassin Claims FBI Framed Him For 1968 Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty to
assassinating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., says he was framed to
cover up an FBI plot to kill the civil rights leader and wants the
government to reopen his case.
   Ray, 60, was sentenced to serve 99 years for King's murder in
Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968. The Tennessee parole board has
scheduled a January parole hearing for him, but Ray says he is not
hopeful.
   ``I doubt very much they'll give me a parole,'' he said. ``I
think the only way I'll get out of here is through a jury. If they
wouldn't grant me a trial I don't see how they'll grant me a
parole.''
   Ray pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on March 9,
1969, but recanted three days later and has not received a complete
trial to prove his innocence.
   He alleges the FBI threatened to jail his father and brother if
he didn't sign a confession. Ray's father was a fugitive from prison
and his brother spent several years in jail.
   In an interview at Brushy State Prison in East Tennessee with
talk show host Morton Downey Jr., Ray claimed he was set up in a
plot to kill King, whose calls for economic justice for minorities
and effective use of non-violent protest drew the wrath of then-FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover.
   He said the government has refused his requests to review the
evidence against him, has never conducted ballistics tests on the
alleged murder weapon and has suppressed witnesses and
investigations that could have cleared him.
   ``Since they won't, they must be hiding something,'' Ray said of
the FBI. The show is scheduled to be aired Nov. 28.
   King was in Memphis the day of his assassination to support a
strike by city sanitation workers seeking higher pay. Ray was
identified from fingerprints on a rifle found near the Lorraine
Motel in Memphis where King was killed as he stood on a balcony.
   Hosea Williams, an aide to King present when he was shot, said
during taping Monday of ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show '' that ``I've
never believed Ray killed Dr. King.''
   Williams said King was convinced that Hoover's FBI was plotting
his death. He also said he was surprised to find days after the
assassination that ``Ray had no political philosophy. He was just a
two-bit redneck hustler.''
   Many blacks have expressed anger that the Tennessee board has
scheduled a January parole hearing for Ray. Under a 1985 law
providing parole hearings for inmates held for 20 years, Ray became
eligible for parole consideration this month.
   The law was designed to allow the state to relieve prison
overcrowding.
   James M. Brown, chairman of the Tennessee Voters Council and a
member of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Committee,
called Ray's parole hearing ``cruel, dangerous and shameful,'' and
said he would ask Gov. Ned McWherter to call it off. He noted the
hearing in January would coincide with the Jan. 16 holiday honoring
King's birthday.
   But McWherter told reporters Monday that he will not interfere
with the decision of the board, which by law is an independent state
agency.
