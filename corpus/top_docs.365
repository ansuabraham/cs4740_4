<HEAD>President Calls For Peace Negotiations With Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joaquim Chissano said Monday
his country is weary of war and said he authorized church leaders to
present government peace proposals to guerrillas.
   Chisano said the church officials and a government delegation
were in Nairobi for talks with guerrilla leaders on Wednesday. In
Portugal, a rebel spokesman said the guerrilla delegation would
consider the government proposals.
   It was not immediately clear what the government proposals would
include.
   An estimated 100,000 people have died in the 12-year-old civil
war that broke out after Mozambique gained independence from
Portugal. About 1.6 million Mozambicans are refugees, and half the
country's 14.7 million people depend, at least partially, on food
aid.
   Chissano, who in the past has rejected negotiations with the
Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas, said Monday he decided to
negotiate because of ``the sentiments of the population vis a vis
the war.''
   He said that although the Mozambican people repudiated the
guerrillas' ``acts of violence'' they also had ``a great desire for
the end of the war.''
   Chissano said he asked Catholic and Protestant members of the
19-church Mozambican Christian Council to meet with a guerrilla
delegation in Nairobi, Kenya to find out ``what they want,'' the
government news agency, AIM, reported.
   AIM quoted Chissano as saying the government will not inist that
the guerrillas lay down their arms, but that they ``end all acts of
terrorism and banditry.''
   Chissano said a Mozambican government delegation consisting of
provincial leaders was also in Nairobi to clarify the government's
position for the Kenyan government or the church delegation.
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
1977, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by South Africa from
1980-84, until South Africa signed a non-aggression pact with
Mozambique.
   The Mozambican government continued to accuse South Africa of
violating the agreement, but relations have improved recently and
the Mozambican government now says support for the guerrillas still
comes from South Africa, but it does not say who is behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the United States and Portugal.

<P>
Peace is proving an elusive commodity in Mozambique, where a population of 15 
million is teetering on the edge of famine. 
</P>
<P>
"Every issue you discuss always comes back to the same point -- the need for 
peace," said a senior European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation 
policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the 
Mozambique government. 
</P>
<P>
"The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same 
people destabilizing Mozambique," the European diplomat said. "If you believe 
the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will 
come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned 
that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the 
population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United 
Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years 
beginning with 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area 
of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or 
early next year and we have no resources to fall back on," Simkin said in an 
interview. "We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive 
relief campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the 
Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and "donor 
weariness." 
</P>
<P>
Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September 
that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in 
Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever 
multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked 
about peace by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened 
optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all 
Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market 
economy, political pluralism and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
"You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining 
power," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from 
Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for 
further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to 
protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian 
Ocean port of Beira. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe 
troops," President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York 
recently. "All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops 
should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow 
if possible." 
</P>
<P>
Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white 
minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing 
force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas 
from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used 
primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against 
Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white 
security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it 
against Maputo. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and 
good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut 
all official links with Renamo. 
</P>
<P>
Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off 
from weapons and communications supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including 
Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique, 
continued to support the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
They believe other support came from groups within Portugal -- Renamo's 
official headquarters are in Lisbon -- and also Britain, West Germany and the 
United States.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Announce Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebel forces have issued a peace
plan saying they would rather participate in elections than carry on
their 12-year-old battle to oust the government by force.
   Their 16-point plan, released in Nairobi Tuesday, represented an
answer to an earlier proposal by the Mozambican government of
President Joaquim Chissano.
   The rebel plan said neither the rebels nor the government would
gain from continued fighting.
   ``It is not Renamo's intention to change the existing order in
Mozambique through armed force,'' said the two-page document,
referring to the Portuguese acronym for the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance.
   ``The armed struggle is just a last recourse in the defense of
the people against the negation of their rights,'' the two-page
document said.
   Renamo has been fighting the Marxist-oriented government since
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1977. The war has
killed an estimated 600,000 people.
   The rebel proposal followed a week of discussions that began Aug.
8 in Nairobi between Renamo and a delegation of Mozambican Roman
Catholic and protestant church leaders.
   During the talks, the church officials presented a 12-point peace
plan from the Mozambican government.
   Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said the rebel proposal was a
response to Chissano's offer, which was never made public.
   In its proposal, Renamo called for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the southeast African nation and urged ``genuine'' peace
negotiations be held.
   The United States and many other Western countries have been
providing non-military aid to the Mozambique government, which
continues to get the bulk of its arms from Soviet bloc. Some Western
countries, including Britain and Portugal, provide some security
assistance. Zimbabwe has large number of troops in Mozambique
helping the government fight the war.
   Chissano said recently he has accepted South Africa's word that
it no longer aids the rebels. However, Mozambique still believes the
rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in South Africa.
   Renamo's statement said the rebels want negotiations toward ``a
national reconciliation without winners or losers'' that would
``finally end in peace.''
   Renamo's other proposals included a call for its own recognition
``as a political force,'' an end to verbal attacks by Chissano's
government and general elections. The guerrilla proposal also stated
Renamo's opposition to human rights abuses.
   ``Renamo is a guerrilla force whose survival depends only on the
people, therefore it is by nature against any atrocity that risks
the lives of the people, its reason for being,'' said the document.
   The rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against
civilians while seeking food or new recruits.
   In an English-language news release accompanying the proposal,
Dhlakama said the church leaders and rebels addressed the withdrawal
of foreign troops and possible ways of ending the conflict.
   The closed-door meetings between church leaders and rebels were
held under Kenyan government auspices.
   The Nairobi talks followed Chissano's request to Presidents
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to mediate an
end to conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
   Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries. An estimated
6 million of its 15 million people receive food aid.

<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African leaders trying to mediate
peace talks between the Mozambican government and guerrillas say
conditions are becoming ripe for direct talks, Mozambique's foreign
minister said Monday.
   Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said on Radio Maputo that
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
had made progress in their efforts, and the Mozambican government
is prepared to talk to members of the Mozambican National
Resistance.
   Pascoal said the mediators told the Mozambican government ``that
the conditions are becoming ripe for a direct dialogue'' between
the Mozambican government and Renamo, the guerrilla group.
   The Kenyan and Zimbabwean leaders have been facilitating talks
between Mozambican churchmen and guerrilla representatives.
   The Mozambican National Resistance began fighting the government
forces in 1977. White-run Rhodesia first supported them, then South
Africa.
   The South African government has said it no longer supports the
guerrillas, but Mocumbi said ``within South Africa, some forces,
even if they are not supported by the government, continue to seek
to use the Renamo bandits as an instrument.'' He said there had
been a reduction in the amount of aid reaching the guerrillas from
across the border, but some assistance continued.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives, displaced more
than 1 million people and left about half the population in need of
food aid.

<HEAD>Bush Urges End to Mozambique Civil War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday saluted Mozambique's
march toward democracy and economic reform, urging President
Joaquim Chissano to begin talks ``at the earliest opportunity'' to
end the 10-year-old civil war.
   Chissano assured Bush that his government was already taking
steps ``to enter into a direct dialogue'' with the RENAMO rebels as
soon as possible.
   Chissano, whose African country has abandoned Marxism and
shifted its sights toward the West, congratulated Bush on U.S.
efforts ``to promote peace and democracy in southern Africa,''
especially Namibia and South Africa.
   Bush, at a departure ceremony after talks in the Oval Office and
over lunch, offered a strong endorsement of Mozambique's reforms,
which he said had also ``buoyed the Mozambique peace process.''
   ``For that, Mr. President, I salute you. Yet we look forward to
even further reforms,'' said Bush, who expressed concern about the
millions of Mozambicans suffering from both the war and drought.
   ``We urge all parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as
to avoid further suffering,'' he said.
   Chissano, who became president in 1986 after Samora Machel died
in a plane crash, said his government had put forward a draft
constitution that would provide for universal sufferage, including
direct election of the president and the People's Assembly.
   Chissano called his reception at the White House ``another giant
step forward'' for Mozambique. It came five years after a
path-breaking visit by Machel to Washington during the Reagan
administration.
   Chissano, speaking English, said he told Bush ``of the decision
of my government to enter into a direct dialogue with RENAMO as
soon as possible, and about the measures already taken to bring
this decision into effect.''
   Chissano expressed appreciation ``for the stand the United
States has taken on the war in Mozambique and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the Mozambique
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   Mozambique, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975,
formally abandoned Marxism last summer. As a reward for embracing
private enterprise and a free-market economy, Bush recently struck
the country from the U.S. list of Marxist states, opening the way
for lending and trade concessions.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of Zimbabwe and Kenya mediating.
   Chissano expressed the hope the United States would ``spare no
effort until peace, stability and economic prosperity are achieved
in the region of southern Africa.''
   An estimated 3.2 million Mozambicans have been driven from their
homes, either to internal or external exile during the civil war.
The international community has had to give Mozambique $300 million
to buy food every year.
   Mozambique, on the southeast coast of Africa, has a population
of 15 million.
   RENAMO was created originally by the white South African
government to counter the Mozambican government's support for the
African National Congress. However, South Africa's new president,
President F.W. de Klerk, has cut off assistance to RENAMO and
recognized the ANC.

   Ten years ago, guerrilla chieftain
Robert Mugabe put pen to paper in London to end a bloody seven-year
war for control of his homeland, Britain's last colonial outpost in
Africa known as Rhodesia.
   That all-party peace pact signed on Dec. 21, 1979, silenced the
guns and led to the birth of black-governed Zimbabwe four months
later.
   A decade later, as president of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is on the
receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels
based in Mozambique.
   While Mugabe was able to lead Rhodesia to peace as Zimbabwe
through talks, he is opposed to similar direct negotiations with
the insurgents, who have threatened to bring their war into
Zimbabwe.
   Alfonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance seeks to
undermine Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano's socialist
government.
   The 12-year-old war has left an estimated 500,000 to 700,000
dead and created about 1 million Mozambican refugees. Almost half
of Mozambique's 15 million people require some food aid.
   The guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital to
landlocked Zimbabwe's economy, and Mugabe has stationed 12,000
troops in Mozambique at a crippling cost of $450,000 a day.
   Dhlakama's rebels now routinely cross the scrub-studded plains
and pine-carpeted mountains into Zimbabwe to raid tea and coffee
plantations, native villages and state schools.
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in these
forays, and tens of thousands have been herded into state-guarded
villages, upsetting life all along the 800-mile frontier.
   ``The Rhodesians forced many people into so-called protected
villages when they were fighting Mugabe's guerrillas,'' said a
Roman Catholic missionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``So there are villagers today who are suspicious that they're
being placed in similar settlements by the government they
support.''
   But missionaries back the government's contention that
Zimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because of
the rebels.
   The guerrillas, known also by their Portuguese acronym Renamo,
have been accused of widespread atrocities, including the killing
of children, mutilating of victims, rape, and destruction of entire
communities.
   The rebels were founded in 1977 by former Rhodesian Prime
Minister Ian D. Smith to hound Mugabe's guerrillas in their
Mozambican bases.
   Mugabe ended aid for Renamo when he came to power and no
government currently acknowledges assistance.
   Mugabe and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi have been acting as
intermediaries in indirect talks in Kenya between the rebels and
the Mozambique government. There have been no breakthroughs since
the talks began in July.
   Mugabe has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks for
Mozambique, insisting Renamo disavow violence and lay down its arms
first.
   Renamo, in turn, demands Zimbabwe withdraw its troops from
Mozambique before face-to-face negotiations can be considered.
   Renamo also demands that Mozambique's government allow it to
take part in elections as a legal party.
   The Mozambican government says it will not accept a second party
but is considering a proposal that would allow people who are not
in the ruling party to run for Parliament.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today preached peace
and reconciliation in northern Mozambique, where a 13-year civil
conflict has forced 1 million to flee and left 6 million at the
edge of famine.
   The Roman Catholic leader traveled from Maputo, the capital, to
this Indian Ocean port city in the devastated north, where he
celebrated Mass before thousands of people, including many refugees.
   The pope lamented ``the prevailing situation of insecurity due
to violence which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress,
leaving limited space for freedom.''
   Beira, which has port and rail facilities that reach into
landlocked African nations, has been a frequent target of attacks
by rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance, known by their
Portuguese acronyn as Renamo.
   The rebels in a statement today from Portugal claimed their
troops killed 46 soldiers from Mozambique and Zimbabwe in the last
30 days, including one near Vila de Mungari, southwest of Beira.
Rebel leader Alfonso Dhlakama also said he hoped the papal visit
would contribute to peace in Mozambique.
   Some Mozambican bishops have been urging President Joaquim
Chissano's Marxist government to start talks with the rebels. John
Paul told Chissano Friday night that ``the efforts of my brother
bishops in Mozambique have always received my backing.''
   The Marxist government, however, has refused to negotiate and
has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with ``armed
bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' Chissano told the
pope.
   The Mozambican army, assisted by Zimbabwean forces, has been
able to keep the rail lines running for the past year.
   Renamo guerrillas also have been extremely active in Nampula
province, where the pope will stop this afternoon for a meeting
with local Roman Catholic clergy.
   The conflict that started in 1975 between the government and the
guerrillas has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into
neighboring countries and left an estimated 6 million of
Mozambique's 14.5 million people in need of food aid, according to
relief organizations.
   The anti-Marxist guerrillas, believed to number between
12,000-22,000, are able to roam the countryside almost at will.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have caused
tremendous economic damage and have been accused of widespread
civilian atrocities. Renamo denies the charges.
   The U.S. State Department, in a report released in April,
estimated the rebels had killed 100,000 civilians in the past two
to three years.
   Earlier this week, Renamo announced a unilateral cease-fire
during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay.
Nonetheless, Mozambique announced extensive security measures for
the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him.
   Mozambique is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern Africa. He has visited Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and
Lesotho and made a brief, unscheduled stop in South Africa after
his plane was diverted in bad weather.
   Mozambique, which also has been ravaged by drought in recent
years, receives most of its military assistance from the Soviet
Union, but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations.
   The United States is the largest donor of food aid to
Mozambique, and Britain has been providing military training.
   Mozambique also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring South Africa, which has backed Renamo in the past.
South Africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but Mozambique has continued
to charge South Africa with providing assistance.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Mozambique Approves Peace Plan with Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MFUWE LODGE, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mozambican government has approved
a peace plan involving negotiations with the guerrillas to end the
country's 12-year civil war, the top U.S. official on African policy
said.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
made the announcement Thursday at the Zambian president's safari
lodge after meeting with Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano.
   Cohen, ending a week-long tour of Africa, headed today to
Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler.
   Briefing Kenneth Kaunda at the president's lodge in eastern
Zambia, Cohen said Chissano had received the approval of the Central
Committee of the ruling party to engage in ``a full-fledged peace
process through negotiations over the conflict in his country.
   ``He has asked the United States to be helpful and we have agreed
to do whatever he thinks we should do to contribute to this
process,'' Cohen said.
   Earlier at Maputo airport, Cohen said Chissano indicated he might
ask the United States to meet with the guerrillas, and that such a
request would be seriously considered.
   Kaunda said he would be willing to meet ``in confidence'' with
F.W. de Klerk, the leader of the ruling National Party in South
Africa and designated to be the country's next president, before or
after the South African parliamentary elections in September. De
Klerk would not become president until September, when he is
virtually certain to succeed P.W. Botha.
   Kaunda has previously said he would be willing to meet de Klerk
after South Africa granted independence to Namibia, whose elections
are not scheduled until November.
   Kaunda did not give a reason for offering to move up a proposed
meeting with de Klerk, but he welcomed the meeting last week between
Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African
National Congress, which has its exile headquarters in Zambia.
   Kaunda said he would also encourage the ANC, which has been
waging intermittent guerrilla attacks in South Africa since 1961, to
talk to the South African government.
   Cohen praised Kaunda for offering to meet de Klerk, whom Cohen
had talked to early this month. He said de Klerk was ``a man who is
willing to listen to ideas.
   ``I believe it is important the he listen not only to the ideas
of Prime Minister (Margaret) Thatcher and (West German Chancellor)
Helmut Kohl, but that he also talks to African leaders, because he
is an African and has to find African solutions to the problems of
South Africa,'' Cohen said.
   ``I am persuaded that the president truly seeks to resolve the
conflict through a political settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is now important for RENAMO (the Portuguese acronym for the
guerrilla organization) to reciprocate by accepting the principle
that no group in Mozambique should seek to impose its will on the
people or government through use of force or violence,'' Cohen said.
   Chissano ``indicated that the United States could play a role in
facilitating the peace process. We agree to play a role and will
continue discussions to decide how this can best be carried out,''
the U.S. official added.
   The national news agency AIM said Cohen made it clear that the
United States' role would be on the side of the Mozambican
government and ``not as a mediator.''
   He said Chissano ``indicated that he might ask us to meet RENAMO
some time. If he does this, we will consider it seriously.''
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
1977, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by South Africa from
1980-84, until South Africa signed a non-agression pact with
Mozambique. The Mozambican government continued to accuse South
Africa of violating the agreement, but relations have improved
recently and the Mozambican government now says support for the
guerrillas still comes from South Africa, but it does not say who is
behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the United States and Portugal.

   Government and rebel leaders traveled
to neighboring Malawi today for their first direct peace talks
aimed at ending a 13-year-old civil war, the national news agency
reported.
   Afonso Dhlakama, commander of the Mozambique National Resistance
known by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO, arrived in Malawi's capital
Blantyre, the AIM news agency said.
   The delegation of the leftist government included Transport
Minister Armando Guebaza and Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi, both
members of the Political Bureau of the ruling FRELIMO Party, AIM
said.
   ``By midday, all the actors in the drama were present in
Blantyre, although the talks had not yet begun,'' AIM said.
   Also in Blantyre to mediate the talks were government officials
from Kenya and Zimbabwe.
   Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi and President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe arranged several indirect, low-level meetings last year
aimed at bringing the two sides to the negotiating table.
   Earlier today, a spokesman for the guerrillas in Lisbon,
Portugal, denied that RENAMO would hold talks in Malawi.
   ``We are prepared to meet anytime, anywhere, except Malawi,''
Manuel Frank told the independent TSF radio station in Lisbon.
   RENAMO had said it would prefer talks in Kenya or Portugal,
which ruled Mozambique until 1975.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives and turned the
southeast African nation into one of the poorest countries in the
world. Almost half of Mozambique's 15 million people require food
assistance and the annual per capita income is less than $200.
   The rebels are active throughout Mozambique, waging hit-and-run
attacks on both military and civilian targets. They have been
accused of committing atrocities against civilians.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although South
Africa openly backed them in the early 1980s, and the
white-minority government of Rhodesia helped them until it became
black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   The rebels have demanded recognition by the government and free
elections in Mozambique, but their political aims have never been
clear.
   Chissano's government officially dropped its Marxist label last
year and has moved away from its socialist-oriented economy toward
a more market-oriented system in recent years.
   The government has proposed a new constitution to allow
elections in which independents could challenge candidates from
Chissano's ruling party, the Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique. However, the government has refused to allow opposition
parties.
   The government receives most of its military aid from the Soviet
Union, but it also has developed good relations with the West in
recent years. The United States is the leading donor of food aid in
Mozambique.

   From Casa Banana, his headquarters deep in the Mozambique bush, guerrilla leader Afonso Dhlakama has become one of the key players in the international sanctions war against South Africa. 

   Mr. Dhlakama, the 33-year-old leader of the Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, is a chubby, bespectacled man who gave up his accounting studies for guerrilla warfare more than a decade ago. 
He and his 22,000 rebels are fighting to overthrow Mozambique's tottering Marxist government, which has been further weakened by the recent death of its first president, Samora Machel. 

   But Renamo also is engaged in a broader struggle against all of black southern Africa that is interfering with international sanctions meant to seal off South Africa. 

   Claiming that it is a black nationalist movement that has no sympathy for the white minority government in Pretoria, Renamo denies that it receives military aid from South Africa. 
But the fact that Renamo's actions play into Pretoria's hands, as well as a history of South African contacts with the guerrillas, have much of the world believing otherwise. 

   Renamo controls most of the Mozambique countryside, and has been able almost at will to attack the oil pipeline, railway, roads and Indian Ocean port that make up the Beira Corridor. 
Were it free from guerrilla attack, the Beira Corridor could provide black southern African countries with an alternative to the present practice of moving the bulk of their trade through South Africa. 
So important is this route in isolating South Africa that the U.S. and several European countries have considered coupling their own sanctions against Pretoria with an aid package to upgrade the carrying capacity of the corridor and keep Beira open. 

   A stable and upgraded Beira Corridor would enable the so-called frontline states, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Zaire, Malawi and Botswana, to reduce their dependence on South Africa and impose economic sanctions on Pretoria. 
But if Renamo continues to blow up the pipeline and railway and hijack trucks, South Africa will retain its intimidating position. 

   "Renamo can render the Beira Corridor so insecure that it won't function," says Andre Thomashausen, a law professor and Renamo analyst at the University of South Africa in Pretoria. 

   And without a functioning Beira Corridor, the black states of southern Africa are trapped. 
Zimbabwe, which has been making the loudest noises about imposing sanctions against Pretoria and would be the hardest hit by any countersanctions, has recently been forced to turn to South Africa for tons of fuel because of supply disruptions in the Beira Corridor. 
About 90% of Zimbabwe's foreign trade passes through South Africa; it is about 50% for Zambia, Zaire and Malawi. 

   Despite the advantages for South Africa of continued Renamo successes, Pretoria stridently denies that it aids the rebels. 
Indeed, it says it wants to improve economic ties with the Mozambique government, now headed by Joaquim Chissano. 
Besides, says a Foreign Ministry official, "Renamo isn't hard up for financial help. 
It has a hard time using up what it has." 

   The Mozambique National Resistance initially was nurtured by security forces in neighboring white-ruled Rhodesia. 
But when black rule came to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa became the main supplier of arms and training, Western diplomats say. 
On occasion, South Africa's deputy foreign minister flew to the Mozambique bush to meet with the rebels. 

   In early 1984, South Africa signed an accord with Mozambique promising to halt its support to the rebels. 
While Renamo offices in South Africa were closed, the suspicion of continued aid to the rebels hasn't diminished. 
President Chissano last week accused South Africa of airdropping supplies to Renamo. 

   Today, diplomats and analysts of the Mozambique war say, Renamo is so strong, compared with the ragged government troops, that it could continue its fight without outside aid. 
In recent months, the rebels have captured several cities in the north and made occasional forays into Maputo, the capital. 
Last year one siege of Maputo was so tight that President Machel slept at night on a yacht several miles offshore, according to press reports. 

   Because of Mozambique's economic crisis, government soldiers are poorly clothed and fed and, despite the assistance of Soviet bloc advisers, badly trained. 

   The Renamo guerrillas are also badly clothed, but they feed off the land, which they control, and they claim to have captured big reserves of Soviet-made arms from government troops. 

   Mr. Dhlakama, who was educated in a Roman Catholic missionary school, says he wants free elections in Mozambique and respect for human rights. 
But, despite such talk, and the stories about Renamo soldiers carrying Bibles, the rebels have a reputation for banditry. 
The government says Renamo's tactics include random attacks on civilian buses, kidnapping and cutting off the noses and ears of peasants who cooperate with the government or resist joining the rebels. 

   Renamo charges the government with religious persecution and with imprisoning opponents in "reeducation camps." 
One way Renamo built up its support initially was by running a radio service that informed people about government prisoners. 

   Mr. Dhlakama, the son of a tribal chief, talks about victory within two years. 
"Militarily, Renamo could win the war. 
It could storm the presidential palace," says Mr. Thomashausen. 
"But it won't unless it has a strategy for the day after." 

   So far, such a strategy hasn't emerged. 
Mr. Dhlakama is said to be interested in pushing for a reconciliation with the government because he realizes there isn't enough expertise within Renamo to run a government by itself. 
And without a reconciliation, the government troops might take to the bush and continue the war. 

   Sources say Mr. Dhlakama also realizes that governing the country would be nearly impossible without international support, which has so far been denied because of his group's ties to South Africa and because the international community recognizes the government. 

   Mr. Dhlakama is said to be jealous of Jonas Savimbi, the high-profile leader of the anti-communist guerrillas in Angola who is received by leaders around the world. 
As a result, Mr. Dhlakama is trying to spruce up his image: his eyeglasses, worn to make him look older, are said to be only window glass, and he is studying English and listening to the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp.

<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe says he will
consult with President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya in the next few
days to prepare the way for peace talks between warring sides in
Mozambique.
   The African leaders are negotiating to end a 12-year war that
has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half of
Mozambique's 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on food
aid.
   Mugabe said he expects to contact Moi ``in the next few days''
to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance, also known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO.
   The peace initiative, headed by Moi, aims at bringing the
guerrillas to a conference table with representatives of President
Joaquim Chissano's Marxist-oriented government, Mugabe said.
   ``We are looking forward to cooperation by RENAMO, as much
cooperation as possible,'' he told reporters Friday, a day after
his return from an Organization of African Unity summit in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia.
   ``We hope eventually there will be direct contact between the
Mozambique government and Renamo. It is these two parties that must
negotiate a settlement to their problems,'' he said.
   Mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust the
Maputo government and are accused of widespread atrocities. They
are considered right-wing because they used to be armed by South
Africa, but their political goals are unclear.
   Mugabe said Chissano asked him on July 10 to join Moi as a
mediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and a
weak infrastructure inherited from Portuguese colonizers, has
placed Mozambique among the world's poorest nations.
   Mugabe met with Moi at the African summit and the two agreed to
``draft parameters on the way we hope to operate'' and compare
notes soon afterward, Mugabe said.
   He said a meeting with Mozambican rebel officials will follow,
but gave no details.
   Landlocked Zimbabwe has 12,000 troops fighting alongside
Mozambican government forces and guarding transport links and an
oil pipeline through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean.
   The proposed rapprochement follows a U.S.-brokered peace accord
for southern African involving independence for Namibia and the
withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops in Angola.
   Until the June 22 cease-fire between Angola's government and
Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed rebels, Zimbabwe opposed similar
negotiations in Mozambique.
   At first, the Mozambican rebels rejected Mugabe as too partisan
to mediate. But earlier this month they accepted his role in the
peace initiative.
   Chissano's government is debating negotiations with the rebels
at the annual congress of its ruling Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, the country's sole legal political party.
   The congress Friday presented a new policy document that drops
all references to Marxism, Leninism and Western imperialism. But it
says the party remains committed to socialism.
   The alterations coincide with a new government drive to end
central control of the economy and reflects Maptuo's improving
relations with Western countries such as the United States, Italy
and Britain.

   Pope John Paul II urged the Marxist
government Friday to make peace with guerrillas and offered to let
the church mediate in this war-torn country, where 6 million people
live on the edge of famine.
   ``In the face of this lamentable situation, when the opportunity
arose, I have never ceased to repeat, `No to violence and yes to
peace,''' the pontiff told President Joaquim Chissano after
arriving from neighboring Swaziland.
   ``The efforts of my brother bishops in Mozambique have always
received my backing,'' John Paul told Chissano, who was baptized a
Roman Catholic but now is non-practicing. About one-eighth of
Mozambique's 11.7 million people are Catholic.
   The bishops have been urging Chissano's government to start
negotiations with anti-Marxist rebels of the Mozambique National
Resistance, known by their Portuguese acronym, Renamo. The
government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops
for advocating talk with ``armed bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' Chissano told the
pope at the Ponte Vermelha (Red Point) palace, built by the
Portuguese colonialists before Mozambique became independent in
1975.
   ``Your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces the
paths of hatred, the trade of war, the murder of innocents and the
inadmissable methods of terrorism,'' Chissano said.
   The 11-year-old civil war in this southeast African country has
forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboring
countries. Nearly half Mozambique's 14.5 million people are in need
of food aid, according to relief organizations.
   Mozambique is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern Africa. In addition to Swaziland, he also has visited
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop in
South Africa on Wednesday after his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The Renamo guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000 and
22,000, roam the countryside almost at will and have caused
tremendous econonic damage.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have been
accused of widespread civilian atrocities. Renamo denies the
charges.
   The U.S. State Department, in a report released in April,
estimated the rebels killed 100,000 civilians in the past two to
three years.
   Renamo this week announced a cease-fire during the pope's visit
and wished the pontiff a good stay. Still, Mozambique announced
extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling
to see him at stops in Nampula, Beira and Maputo, the capital.
   Mozambique receives most of its military assistance from the
Soviet Union but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations. The United States is the largest donor of food aid in
Mozambique, and Britain has been providing military training.
   Mozambique also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring South Africa, which has backed Renamo in the past.
South Africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but Mozambique has continued
to accuse South Africa of providing assistance.
   Mozambique regularly refers to South Africa as the ``racist
regime,'' but on Monday Chissano hosted South African President
P.W. Botha on his first summit meeting in a black-ruled African
nation.
   The Vatican has tried to prod the peace process in Mozambique by
sending one of John Paul's top cardinal aides to meet separately
with Botha and Chissano in July. Also, some Mozambican bishops
reportedly have maintained contacts with Renamo.
   Chissano met the pope in May in Rome, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to move the peace process ahead.
   In Mbabane, Swaziland, earlier Friday, the pope preached about
the virtues of monogamy at a Mass attended by Swaziland's
20-year-old king and his four wives.
   King Mswati III, the world's youngest monarch, sat
expressionless as the pope told a crowd of 10,000 at the capital's
national stadium that God intended each husband to have one wife.
   The pope, who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escorted
by spear-carrying warriors, spoke from an altar topped by a turret
manned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars.

  [Text] Speaking in Tete Province yesterday, President of 
the Republic Joaquim Chissano announced that the government has 
decided to temporarily suspend its troop demobilization process. 
As a reason for such a decision, the Mozambican head of state 
said that the Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] troop 
demobilization process had not been balanced. He also noted the 
need for making technical corrections to the figures and lists 
that Renamo has been supplying to the UN Operations in 
Mozambique Technical Unit. 
  NOTICIAS reports that President Joaquim Chissano made that 
announcement after visiting the troop assembly area in Ulongwe, 
the capital of Tete Province's Angonia District. NOTICIAS also 
reports that the Mozambican head of state warned the soldiers of 
the need for them to remain in the area for a while longer. He 
explained that it is an area that continues to deserve special 
attention. NOTICIAS says President Chissano was indirectly 
referring to the fact that Renamo soldiers continue to be 
powerfully armed and terrorizing the civilian population in many 
parts of Tete Province. 
  The president of the Republic traveled 260 km on the road 
between the city of Tete, the provincial capital, and Angonia 
District. He passed many areas where Renamo continues to 
prevent the Mozambican Government from implementing the National 
Reconstruction Program and other political organizations from 
doing their political work. 
  NOTICIAS also reports today that a South African citizen was 
distributing photographs of Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in one 
of the areas visited by the Mozambican head on his way to 
Angonia District. That South African citizen had not been 
allowed to come into the country from Malawi, but was 
subsequently seen in Mozambican territory.

   Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano said
Thursday his government is willing to start talks within several
weeks with the RENAMO rebels on ending the country's 10-year civil
war.
   Chissano said he was awaiting an answer from the rebels through
mediators who have been trying to bring the sides together. He
praised the United States for a seven-point proposal it presented
both sides last year to help them overcome their reluctance to
negotiate.
   ``We feel we can now go into talks,'' Chissano told reporters at
a news conference summing up three days of talks with President
Bush, top officials of his administration and congressional leaders.
   ``If RENAMO gives us a quick answer, we are ready to start,'' he
added. Negotiations could begin as soon as Chissano returns from
next week's ceremonies marking the independence of neighboring
Namibia, he said.
   RENAMO had been reluctant to accept one of the points that deals
with recognition of Mozambique's government and its constitution,
Chissano said. But now, the rebels appear willing to recognize the
government and recognition of the constitution can be worked out
during the actual peace talks, he said.
   Mozambique, which in recent years has renounced its Marxist
doctrine and shifted to a market-oriented economy, is drafting a
constitution that would allow independent candidates to run in
elections, he said. Individuals from RENAMO would be eligible to
participate, Chissano said.
   The people of Mozambique will also vote this summer on a
proposal to allow more than one political party. If that happens,
RENAMO could compete in elections, he said.
   Mozambique has been devastated by the fighting with RENAMO,
founded in the 1970s by white South Africans to counter the
government's support for the guerrillas of the African National
Congress. The group has been accused by U.S. officials and human
rights monitors of savage attacks on innocent civilians.
   Chissano said he was satisfied that the South African government
of F.W. de Klerk had stopped all assistance to RENAMO. He said
South African authorities were cooperating with his government to
stop aid for the rebels from inidividuals in South Africa. The
organization also has wealthy right-wing backers in Portugal and
Brazil.
   While praising de Klerk for progress he has made toward starting
talks with his country's black majority about the future of
apartheid, Chissano also urged the United States to maintain its
economic sanctions against South Africa ``until everyone is sure
the process is irreversible.''
   Chissano said he had asked Bush for additional financial help to
rehabilitate his country and help an estimated 5.6 million refugees
and handicapped people. Mozambique receives more than $100 million
annually from the United States, making it the largest aid
recipient in sub-Saharan Africa.

   A decade ago, thousands of guerrillas
flooded across the border from Mozambique to mount a final assault
against the white-minority government in what then was call
Rhodesia.
   Today, eight years after Rhodesia became black-governed
Zimbabwe, battalions of troops, including guerrilla veterans of
that independence war, are strung along the same border _ this time
to block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting to
overthrow Mozambique's government.
   The outcome of the guerrillas' strikes in Mozambique and inside
Zimbabwe will have a major impact on the fragile economies of the
troubled region in southern Africa.
   Several black-ruled states are striving to divert their trade
traffic from South Africa to Indian Ocean ports in Mozambique, a
former Portuguese colony, in a bid to loosen their economic
dependency on the South Africans.
   The rebels, in turn, vow to continue sabotaging Mozambique's
supply lines that also serve Malawi, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   So far, the 12,000 to 20,000 guerrillas of the anti-government
Mozambique National Resistance seem unharried by the conventional
forces ranged against them in Mozambique and Zimbabwe _ some 30,000
Mozambican regulars, more than 12,000 Zimbabweans, 2,000 Tanzanians
and a few hundred Malawians.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves nationalists opposing a
Marxist-based government, roam Mozambique's 10 provinces and mount
frequent raids into Zimbabwe with virtual impunity.
   ``It's very strange being on the other side,'' said a young
Zimbabwean corporal who fought the Rhodesians under the name
Comrade Hammer.
   ``We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. But
these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they
think and what they might do next.''
   The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO,
originally were formed by the Rhodesian intelligence service in
1977, two years after Mozambique's independence from Portugal, to
harass nationalist guerrillas directed by Robert Mugabe from inside
Mozambique during Zimbabwe's 1973-79 independence war.
   Mugabe became Zimbabwe's prime minister at independence from
Britain in April 1980 and cut support to the Mozambican rebels. But
South Africa took over the reins until 1984 when it signed a
non-aggression pact with Mozambique. Since then, Mozambique claims
South African support has continued, a charge denied by the South
African government.
   The Mozambican rebels declared war on Zimbabwe last year after
Mugabe vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in Mozambique
would fight to keep its government in power.
   Since then they have stepped up raids along the 750-mile
frontier of forested mountains and scrub-dotted plains.
   Rebels have killed scores of villagers and some security-force
militias. They have abducted hundreds of civilians, including
children, and marched them at gunpoint into Mozambique, apparently
as dragooned recruits.
   They also have destroyed government schools, clinics and
development projects; robbed country stores and remote homesteads
of food, drink and clothing; ambushed buses and looted passengers;
ordered workers to leave forestry estates, coffee plantations and
orchards; rustled cattle, sheep and goats.
   Mugabe has exhorted his troops ``to erect an impassable defense
along our border'' to prevent fresh incursions.
   He also urged them to renew military efforts inside Mozambique
``to completely deny the enemy any ... chance to sabotage our
arteries to the sea.''
   Lt. Col. Solomon Mujuru, a wartime guerrilla chieftain and now
Zimbabwe's army commander, called on civilians living along the
frontier to report people they suspect might have links to the
guerrillas.
   But Mujuru said Zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand in
counterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eight
months ago.
   Before June, Mujuru's soldiers and the rebels clashed only in
Mozambique.
   Since then, troops of Zimbabwe's new 5,000-member 6th Brigade
have reinforced border defenses, militias are guarding farms,
villages, schools and clinics and cross-border movement has been
banned except at established immigration posts.
   Anti-personnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thought
to cross into Zimbabwqe and the identification papers of some
65,000 Mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened by
local authorities and the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees.
   In addition, courts have cracked down on local peasants
suspected of links to the insurgents. Early in February, a Mutare
judge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five years
for failing to report the presence of bandits to officials.
   At stake in the conflict is not only the survival of Mozambique,
its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine.
   Also at issue is the fate of the so-called Beira Corridor, a
186-mile trade route that meanders through mountains, fertile
valleys and swamps from the Zimbabwean border city to the Indian
Ocean port of Beira in Mozambique.
   A fifth of the overseas trade of the black-ruled neighbor states
flows along the corridor's railroads and highways. Landlocked
Zimbabwe receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridor
pipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas. Most of that
trade and oil previously went through South Africa.
   Both Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique have
rejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with the
guerrillas, arguing that the rebels are puppets of South Africa's
government and have no support from either the East or the West.
   Mugabe, at the graduation ceremony for the 6th Brigade in
September, said he was forced to form the unit because of what he
called South African destabilization in the region.
   ``South Africa's subversion of Mozambique's ... sovereignity had
the potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea,'' Mugabe
said.
   ``The survival of Mozambique is our survival,'' Mugabe said.
``The fall of Mozambique certainly also will be our fall.''

<HEAD>Mozambique, Rebels Postpone Direct Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first direct peace talks between
Mozambique's government and right-wing rebels have been postponed.
   A communique Wednesday by officials of Mozambique's leftist
government and mediating countries said the talks did not begin as
scheduled Tuesday in Malawi, which borders the troubled southeast
African nation.
   The discussions were to include Mozambican Cabinet ministers and
Alfonso Dhlakama, head of the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrilla army, known by its Portuguese acronym Renamo.
   The communique said without elaboration that the talks were
postponed because of ``difficulties experienced by the Kenya and
Renamo delegations.''
   ``Efforts are continuing to set a new date in the near future
for the process to begin in Malawi,'' said the statement, published
by the official Malawi News Agency, Mana.
   Renamo has been fighting for control of the territory for 13
years and opposes the one-party rule of President Joaquim Chissano.
The war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, mostly
civilians.
   The Mozambique national news agency, AIM, had reported from
Blantyre on Tuesday that Mozambican Cabinet ministers and the
leader of the guerrillas had gathered in the city for the talks.
But Renamo did not sign Wednesday's communique. The host government
for several days declined to grant visas for Western correspondents
seeking to report on the meeting.
   Renamo has opposed Malawi as a venue, favoring either Kenya or
Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler that granted
independence in 1975.
   Malawian officials, contacted by telephone from the Zimbabwean
capital, Harare, said they were not authorized to discuss the
aborted meeting beyond what was published in the communique.
   The Blantyre talks were expected to focus on President
Chissano's proposals for a new constitution to allow independents
to oppose the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique at
elections.
   But Chissano has rejected demands for the creation of opposition
parties.
   Kenya and Zimbabwe have for several months brokered low-level
peace talks.

   President Bush, trying his hand at African
peacemaking, called today for early negotiations to end
Mozambique's 10-year civil war.
   Bush issued the plea after talks with Joaquim Chissano, the
president of the former Marxist state.
   At a departure ceremony after talks in the Oval Office and over
lunch, Bush said Chissano's government has taken ``significant
steps to heal divisions which threaten your nation. And we urge all
parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as to avoid further
suffering.''
   He praised Chissano for strengthing ties with the United States
and adopting reforms on voting, property rights and religious
freedoms, but said more needs to be done.
   ``We look forward to even further reforms,'' the president said.
``So we talked today of common concerns like refugee issues and
Mozambique's humanitarian concerns _ the crisis in humanitarian
concerns, I might add.''
   Chissano said he assured Bush that his government was ready to
enter into direct talks with rebel forces as soon as possible. He
also said he expressed appreciation ``for the stand the United
States has taken on the war in Mozambique and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   Chissano appeared taken aback by the crush of television cameras
on hand to witness the start of his Oval Office visit.
   As the crews pushed their long boom microphones toward his face,
Chissano asked, ``What do you do with all these photos? It's too
many.''
   The media people were ushered out as Bush and Chissano, seated
in wingback chairs by the fireplace, began their talks in private.
   A U.S. official who briefed reporters about today's visit said
the government of Mozambique and the RENAMO rebels were nearing
agreement on starting peace talks.
   ``I believe they're in a pre-negotiating stage right now to
determine the framework for their talks. And we're hoping that they
will take the final step to get together,'' said the official, who
spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the Mozambique
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   Mozambique, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975, has
dropped its Marxist ideology and turned to private enterprise and a
free-market economy in recent years. As a reward, Bush recently
struck the country from the U.S. list of Marxist states, opening
the way for lending and trade concessions.
   ``It is our belief that because so many of RENAMO's demands have
been met already, it should not be too difficult to enter into a
negotiated settlement in the near future,'' said the official.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of Zimbabwe and Kenya mediating.
Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen and other U.S. officials
also have been trying to help.
   The United States reportedly has a seven-point plan that would
meet both sides' preconditions for talks.
   ``We have been acting as a facilitator. And we will be wanting
to consult with President Chissano at this time to see what more we
can do to help the start of direct negotiations,'' said the
official.
   The war has been a costly one. An estimated 3.2 million
Mozambicans have been driven from their homes, either to internal
or external exile. The international community has had to give
Mozambique $300 million to buy food every year.
   Created originally by the white South African government to
counter the Mozambican government's support for the African
National Congress, RENAMO has in recent months lost much of its
ideological and financial support.
   When President F.W. de Klerk came to power in South Africa last
year, he stopped assistance to RENAMO. He since has dropped the ban
on ANC and has made overtures to its leadership designed to lead to
talks about the future of the apartheid racial discrimination
system.
   RENAMO still gets money from sympathizers in Portugal and Brazil.

<HEAD>Report Mozambique Allowing Churchmen to Talk to Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marxist Mozambique has decided for the
first time to allow talks with right-wing rebels in a bid to bring
peace to the former Portuguese colony, a church leader said Tuesday.
   The Rev. Filipe Sigue Banze of the Mozambique United Methodist
Church told reporters that a mediation committee of church leaders
has been set up with the blessing of the Maputo government to
contact the Mozambique National Resistance.
   The resistance group, also known by its Portuguese acronym
RENAMO, has been blamed for widespread atrocities, making hundreds
of thousands of people homeless and forcing tens of thousands more
into exile.
   Guerrillas who have been fighting for control of the southeast
African territory for a decade, control most of the countryside and
make it dangerous for civilians to venture out of the capital,
Maputo.
   ``The government believes that since the churches represent many
of the people it is for the churches to establish dialogue with the
destabilizers of the region,'' Banze told a news conference.
   There was no immediate comment from the Mozambique government.
Until now, President Joaquim Chissano's government had refused to
allow any dialogue with the rebels, arguing they are terrorists on
the payroll of neighboring South Africa.
   In recent talks with Chissano, South African President P.W. Botha
pledged that all support for the rebels had stopped.
   Banze said the Peace and Reconciliation Committee was established
by the 17-member General Christian Council of Mozambique under the
leadership of Anglican Bishop Denis Sengulane.
   Committee members first met Chissano in August and got specific
instructions to seek direct talks with the rebels, he said.
   ``We the leaders of the church believe we can carry out that
role,'' Banze said. The first problem is finding the leaders, who
are scattered throughout Mozambique, he said.
   Banze said the committee hoped to report progress in peace
efforts at a meeting with Chissano next month.
   ``We do not know what the atmosphere will be like,'' the cleric
said. ``If it is favorable on the one side we will then speak to the
other side. We have to take it as it comes.''
   Ultimately, Banze said, the committee hoped to get the government
and the guerrillas to talk to each other.
   Banze was among 150 church leaders and human rights activists at
a five-day World Council of Churches conference in Harare on South
African destabilization in the region.
   The guerrrila group was created by the intelligence services of
the Rhodesian government in 1977 to harass black nationalist
guerrillas who used Mozambique as a launching pad for offensives
into Rhodesia.
   The General Christian Council of Mozambique does not include the
Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination in the
country with about 2 million adherents out of the 15 million people.
Half of Mozambicans adhere to traditional animist beliefs and about
10 percent are Moslem.

   Negotiators for Mozambique's leftist government and
the nation's rebels held their first direct peace talks this week
and said today they would try to end the 13-year-old insurgency.
   The talks, involving the rebels' No. 2 leader and a government
minister, could lead to a cease-fire by the end of the year, said
Mario Raffaelli, a parliamentary deputy who monitored the talks for
the Italian government.
   Both sides met Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at the Rome
headquarters of San Egidio Community, a religious organization that
aids poor immigrants in Italy, and which also observed the talks.
   The negotiations were not announced ahead of time and were held
privately.
   An estimated 600,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
war in the southeast African nation. The rebels have been accused
of widespread civilian atrocities by the U.S. State Department and
others.
   The war has left Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the
world. Annual per capita income is about $200 and almost half the
15 million people require some level of food aid.
   Leading the Mozambican government delegation in the talks was
Armando Gebuza, minister of transport and communication. Raul
Domingos, No. 2 official for RENAMO, as the rebels are known,
headed the other delegation.
   ``We could be optimistic'' about the possibility for a
cease-fire, Raffaelli said. ``I think it's realistic that there
could be one by the end of this year, maybe in time for
Christmas,'' said Raffaelli, a Socialist who formerly was the
Foreign Ministry's undersecretary for Africa.
   Raffaelli said both sides would meet again in Rome ``as soon as
possible,'' probably within several weeks.
   RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican National
Resistance, has been fighting a war against the government of the
country, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``Keeping in mind the greater interests of the Mozambican
nation, both sides have agreed on the necessity to put aside that
which divides them, and to concentrate, with priority, their
attention on that which unites them, toward creating a common
working base to realize, in a spirit of mutual comprehension, a
dialogue within which they can debate their different points of
view,'' said a communique signed by the two sides and released
today.
   Both sides said they were ready to commit themselves toward
``the search for a working platform to end the war and to create
political, economic and social conditions that will allow a lasting
peace and the normalization of life of all Mozambican citizens.''
   Before the peace talks this week, efforts by Kenya and Zimbabwe
had failed to get both sides to the negotiation table.
   Raffaelli said both sides agreed a month ago to have the talks
held in Italy. The Vatican was informed about the peace efforts but
was not directly involved, officials at the news conference said.
   Pope John Paul II visited Mozambique in September 1988.
   RENAMO says its wants recognition as a political party and free
elections, but its political program has never been clear. No
government publicly supports the rebels, although South Africa
openly backed them until it signed a mutual non-aggression pact
with Mozambique in 1984.
   Mozambique's ruling Frelimo Party dropped its Marxist label last
year and has been liberalizing the economy and politics. The
government of President Joaquim Chissano is working toward a more
market-oriented economy and is considering a constitution that
would allow independents to run for parliament. however, it has not
come out in favor of allowing opposition parties.
   The Mozambican government still receives most of its weapons
from the Soviets, but it has developed increasingly close ties with
Western countries.
   Britain helps train government troops and the United States is
the leading food donor to Mozambique.

   President Joaquim Chissano has
announced that, for the first time in Mozambique's history,
opposition parties will be allowed to compete for power.
   The move, reported Tuesday by the national news agency AIM, was
considered a major concession that could help end the nation's
13-year-old civil war.
   The conflict has claimed about 100,000 lives, most of them
civilians.
   ``For those who want to form parties, as long as they obey the
law, as long as they behave peacefully, we have no right to prevent
them from doing so,'' AIM quoted Chissano quoted as saying.
   Chissano said the political bureau of the ruling FRELIMO party
had voted unanimously to adopt a multiparty system and that it
should be in place for parliamentary and presidential elections
next year.
   FRELIMO has ruled Mozambique as the sole legal political party
since independence from Portugal in 1975. The party was Marxist,
but has undergone reforms in recent years and officially dropped
its Marxist label last year.
   Rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance began their
insurgency in 1977, and the war has made this southeast African
nation one of the poorest countries in the world.
   Almost half of Mozambique's 15 million people require food aid.
More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the annual per
capita income is under $200.
   The rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym, RENAMO, demand a
multiparty system and free elections.
   The government and rebels held their first direct talks three
weeks ago in Rome. No major breakthroughs emerged, but more talks
are considered likely.
   Asked if RENAMO could become a legal political party, Chissano
said, ``I don't imagine that RENAMO will have any difficulty in
fulfilling the criteria.
   ``RENAMO knows the country, they have people in all the
provinces and districts. They have the possibility of creating a
base, though how big it would be, I don't know.''
   The rebels have no clear political program. They have devastated
the country with hit-and-run attacks and have been accused of
widespread civilian atrocities by the U.S. State Department and
others.
   The government controls the major cities, but the rebels are
active throughout the country in rural areas.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although South
Africa openly backed them before signing a 1984 mutual
non-aggression pact with Mozambique.
   Mozambique still receives most of its military help from the
Soviet Union. But the government has developed close ties with the
United States and other Western countries in recent years.
   Britain helps train the army and the United States is the

   President Joachim Chissano blamed
South Africa for Mozambique's devastating civil war but sent an
emissary on a goodwill mission to the white-ruled nation, raising
the possibility of a summit meeting.
   Chissano spoke harshly of South Africa at the opening of a
conference convened Tuesday by his Marxist-oriented government and
the United Nations to address Mozambique's emergency relief needs
for the coming year.
   Mozambique says 6 million of its 14.5 million people need
emergency food aid. It has appealed for 900 million tons of donated
food, as well as other assistance, with a total cost of $380
million.
   Mozambique attributes most of its problems to the insurgency
waged since 1977 by the Mozambique National Resistance, which it
says is backed by South Africa in violation of a 1984
non-aggression treaty.
   But as the conference began, Chissano dispatched Cooperation
Minister Jacinto Veloso with a conciliatory message for South
African President P.W. Botha. South Africa's Foreign Ministry said
Veloso met with Botha, conveyed Chissano's interest in improving
relations and discussed a possible summit meeting between the two
leaders.
   The Foriegn Ministry quoted Botha as offering to promote
regional development and saying the two countries should stop
accusing each other of breaching the 1984 non-aggression accord.
   In the treaty, Mozambique and South Africa pledged to halt
assistance to insurgents fighting the other country's government.
   There is widespread international support for Mozambique's claim
that South African security forces continue to provide logistical
aid to the Mozambican rebels despite the treaty.
   The conference in Maputo was attended by about 200 delegates
from U.N. agencies, relief organizations and foreign governments.
   A U.S. delegate, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Roy Stacey,
accused the Mozambican rebels of ``one of the most brutal
holocausts against ordinary human beings since World War II.''
   Stacey said the rebels' supporters, ``wherever they may be,
cannot wash the blood from their hands unless all support for this
unconscionable violence is stopped immediately.'' Without
specifying figures, he said the United States intended to make
Mozambique its largest aid recipient in sub-Saharan Africa.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a message to
the conference, said Mozambique ``remains the target of externally
supported acts of destabilization.''
   ``This continued reign of terror has increasingly involved
random and brutal killings, pillaging of the population, wide-scale
destruction and sabotage,'' he said.
   In his speech, Chissano said South Africa was engaged in a
``criminal and irresponsible'' strategy to weaken black-ruled
southern African states.
   He said the rebel movement ``has its command in South Africa,
where it receives all kinds of aid.''
   A Swedish official, Sten Rylander, urged the international
community to provide security assistance, as well as emergency aid,
in order to protect relief projects.
   Despite the strains between Mozambique and South Africa, there
have been signs of increasing cooperation.
   The two governments have engaged in negotiations aimed at
rehabilitating a major hydroelectric project in Mozambique that has
been frequently targeted by rebel saboteurs.
   On Monday, the chairman of South Africa's largest conglomerate
held talks with Chissano and other Mozambican officials in Maputo
on the possible involvement of Anglo American Corp. in developing
Mozambique's natural resources. Anglo's chairman, Gavin Relly, said
his company might be interested in forestry, agriculture and
natural gas projects.

Mozambique and Its People: Pawns in a Brutal Struggle

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> AFRIC </IN>
<TEXT>
   Of all the horror stories in the world this year, one of the most appalling is that of Mozambique. 
Four and a half million people, one-third of the population, are near starvation; 100,000 have died of malnutrition. 
Infant mortality is among the highest in the world: 375 out of every 1,000 children die before the age of five. 
Clinics, schools, farms and factories have been destroyed throughout most of the country. 
Water and electricity services are usually disrupted; gasoline is scarce, as are transport vehicles. 

   Massacres are not uncommon. 
Women and children have been hacked to death with machetes or burned alive in buses; 424 Mozambicans were slaughtered in the village of Homoine on July 19; 92 in Manjacaze on Aug. 10; 51 in Taninga on Oct. 18. 
Refugees from the rural areas have fled to the capital, Maputo, or to neighboring countries. 

   All of these devastations are a result of the decade-long war between Mozambique's Frelimo government and the mercenary force known as MNR, or Renamo. 
After 400 years of Portuguese rule, Frelimo won independence for Mozambique in 1975. 
A year later, Portuguese colonists and Rhodesian intelligence agents, angry that Frelimo was supporting guerrillas based in Mozambique and seeking to overthrow the white-settler regime in neighboring Rhodesia, created Renamo. 

   Though unsuccessful at blocking independence in Zimbabwe, these forces did not abandon their goal of destabilizing both it and Mozambique. 
Since the death of Mozambican leader Samora Machel, Renamo has formally declared war on Zimbabwe and increasingly carries out brutal attacks on villages there. 
Last June, 11 villagers were killed at Kgodora near Rushinga, about 12 miles inside Zimbabwe. 
In October, 13 peasants were killed with machetes at Chiredzi in southeastern Zimbabwe. 
On Nov. 19, Renamo atacked a school on a tea plantation near Chipinga, killing five children, cutting ears and noses off nine others and abducting 20. 

   In Mozambique the war is severely undermining the economy. 
The national debt stands at $4 billion, and the cost of supporting the war equals that. 
Production is crippled and there is a trade deficit of $447.8 million. 
Under such circumstances Frelimo's economic-recovery program has little chance of succeeding. 
Prime Minister Joaquim Chissano has appealed to Britain and other EEC members for humanitarian aid and has called on neighboring countries for assistance. 

   Meanwhile, South Africa continues to supply Renamo, as it has since 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence. 
South Africa perceives the political dislocation and economic dependency of its neighbors as vital to the preservation of apartheid and its own internal security. 
The familiar rationale that these nations pose a communist threat in the region is used to prolong this war of carnage. 

   Right-wing politicians in the U.S. -- inter alios Jesse Helms, Robert Dole and Jack Kemp -- and organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and Free the Eagle, are also drumming up support for Renamo's murderers, again with the claim that Mozambique is a Soviet colony. 
Of course, visitors to Maputo see no evidence of a Soviet presence: no battleships in the harbor, no soldiers in uniform. 
The right wing might as well be worried about a Scandinavian takeover of Mozambique. 
Countries from that region and elsewhere in the West send humanitarian aid and relief workers to minister to the victims of South African-backed violence. 
Britain has sent military officers and advisers to train the armed forces of Frelimo. 

   In an attempt to recover from a devastating series of natural disasters and to stop South Africa's support for Renamo, Machel signed a nonaggression pact with South Africa in 1984, the Nkomati Accord. 
He agreed to remove ANC bases from Mozambique in return for South Africa's abandonment of Renamo. 
Machel carried out his part of the bargain; South Africa did not. 
And justified repugnance at this flouting of an accord has no doubt fueled suspicions, persisting through several investigations, that the South Africans did after all have a hand in the air crash that killed Machel. 

   When Zimbabwean/Mozambican forces overran a Renamo base in Gorongosa, they found documents detailing the collaboration of South African military officers and government ministers with the MNR. Witnesses to massacres and escaped prisoners of the mercenaries report seeing South African supplies and military equipment. 
Guns with serial numbers obscured and bullets traceable to South Africa's military have been captured. 
Numerous sightings of South African-marked aircraft -- e.g., near the Malawi border when Renamo seized the town of Milanje in Zambezia Province in September 1986 -- have been logged. 

   The Reagan administration has acted with caution in Mozambique, although it is under steady pressure from the fanatic ultraright to provide military assistance to Renamo. 
The confirmation of Melissa Wells, the new U.S. ambassador to Mozambique, was opposed by Sen. Helms and others on the issue of whether she would accept the role of mediator between Renamo and Frelimo. 
Furthermore, considerable propaganda aimed at magically transforming Renamo from an army of mercenaries into "freedom fighters" or "a popular resistance movement" continues to flow from the offices of various senators and congresspersons. 
Very little, if any, reliable information on Mozambique finds its way into the mainstream press. 

   There are two stories in Mozambique: extreme human suffering and the country's strategic political and economic importance to South African hegemony in the region. 
Mozambicans are among the poorest people in the world. 
Thousands live in abandoned railroad cars, and these are the lucky ones. 
According to some who were captured by Renamo and have escaped, many soldiers in the MNR are peasants, often children, who have been given a choice, fight or die. 
There are rumors that Mozambican miners in South Africa are presented with the same choice. 
They are then trained in military camps inside South Africa and sent back to form the MNR cadres. 

   Prime Minister Chissano, aware of the way in which men and boys are conscripted into the bandit ranks, is now proposing an amnesty for those who want to lay down their arms. 
These people have been pawns in a much wider struggle; not that of some imagined East-West confrontation, but the prolonged struggle of colonization, liberation and recolonization that makes such strange allies of Thatcher and Chissano, or Jonas Savimbi and South African general Magnus Malan. 

   South Africa is hanging on to apartheid by a fascistic military and police apparatus. 
Its leaders are not really afraid of being slaughtered by black communists but of losing economic and political power over an enormously rich region. 
Their tactics are spelled out in the language of starvation, mutilation and economic destruction inflicted on Mozambique. 
That the American right and politicians such as Robert Dole should applaud the agents of these horrors is perhaps the most squalid of all the conservative "crusades" available to us at this season.

   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya are set to meet Monday for talks aimed at
ending the 12-year-old civil war in Mozambique.
   About 100,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
war, which has made refugees of another 1.6 million people and
ruined the economy of the southern African nation.
   Mugabe and Moi are expected to confer with Afonso Dhlakama,
leader of the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government.
   The rebel and government delegations are not expected to meet,
but to exchange proposals through the mediating presidents.
   Mugabe on Saturday announced the visit to ``compare notes'' with
Moi after he met in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare with President
Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique. Details of their discussions were
not released.
   Last month, Mugabe said Chissano asked him to join Moi in trying
to negotiate an end to the war.
   The Mozambique government representatives _ Roman Catholic and
Protestant members of the Mozambique Christian Council _ reportedly
are carrying a 12-point peace plan from Chissano, but details have
not been made public.
   Dhlakama and the church delegation arrived in Nairobi late last
week. They originally were to meet in Kenya's capital last month,
but Dhlakama failed to arrive.
   The rebels initially rejected the mediation of Zimbabwe, which
has about 12,000 soldiers fighting alongside Mozambican government
forces to protect rail links and an oil pipeline from the Indian
Ocean.
   The rebels formerly were backed by the white-ruled government
South Africa in their fight to oust the Marxist Maputo government.
But they no longer have open support from any government and are
widely accused of atrocities against civilians.

THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty-stricken Mozambique's 16-year civil
war gets under way in Rome today where President Joaquim Chissano is due to
meet his rebel opponent for the first face-to-face peace talks.
Observers say there is a new-found sense of realism on both sides at the
talks, born of a recognition that Mozambique and its 15m people simply
cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction.
The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation
caused by the worst drought in Mozambique's history but exacerbated by the
war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at
least 4m people to flee their homes.
The outcome of the talks is also vital to efforts to resuscitate
Mozambique's aid-dependent economy where average per capita income is less
than Dollars 80 and where Mr Chissano says half the country's people cannot
feed themselves.
Hopes are high that after two years of failed talks, the warring sides,
tired by fighting and the suffering inflicted on their people, may now be
prepared to reach agreement. The optimism is boosted by the involvement in
the talks of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the foreign ministers of Italy
and Botswana.
A critical role is also being played behind the scenes by the European
Community, the United Nations and Mr Tiny Rowland, the chief executive of
Lonrho, which has substantial but unfulfilled agro-industrial commercial
interests in Mozambique.
However, the same nagging obstacles which have defeated eleven rounds of
peace talks held over the past two years remain as formidable as ever.
Renamo, the right-wing rebel group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, has little in
the way of a political programme to present as a basis of dialogue. It was
originally formed and supported by the Rhodesian secret service in 1974 to
combat the communist black nationalist Frelimo party, which swept to power
in Mozambique a year later.
After Zimbabwean independence in 1980, South Africa continued the military
and logistical support of Renamo as part of its destabilisation and sabotage
campaign in hostile neighbouring states. Throughout this period, Renamo
never tried to build a mass popular base, like other rebel insurgencies, but
adopted tactics of sabotage and terrorism against civilians.
The end of the Cold War, the abandonment of communism by Frelimo and
introduction of liberal political and economic reforms followed by the
changes in South Africa have left Renamo an anachronism. However, now backed
by right-wing extremists in Portugal and South Africa, it has continued its
campaign of terror and destruction.
Fears are also widespread that one of the reasons Mr Dhlakama has been
reluctant to speed the peace process is that he may not exercise control
over his troops, many of whom are no more than marauding bandits.
Efforts to reach a successful ceasefire between the two sides as a prelude
to political dialogue has broken down over Renamo's demand that the Frelimo
government withdraw an estimated 5,000-7,000 Zimbabwean troops stationed in
Mozambique to guard trade routes and an oil pipeline between the two
countries.

   President P.W. Botha of South Africa,
on his first summit-level mission into black Africa, met Monday
with leaders of Mozambique's Marxist government, which has blamed
much of its woes on Botha's nation.
   President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique shook hands with Botha
at an airfield welcoming ceremony, then took him on a tour by jeep
of the nearby Cahora Bassa hydroelectric project before a two-hour
meeting.
   Afterward, Botha said he invited Chissano to visit South Africa
and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their
support for regional cooperation. They said committees would be
formed to deal with issues such as trade, economic development and
migrant labor.
   South Africa has signed an agreement to help rehabilitate the
Cahora Bassa project, in the northwestern province of Tete. The
power line leading to South Africa from the dam near Songo has been
sabotaged repeatedly by guerrillas which Mozambique claims are
aided by Botha's security forces.
   Chissano said Botha gave assurances that South Africa was not
helping the rebels.
   Botha was to go to Malawi later for talks Tuesday with President
Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Malawi is the only African state that has
full diplomatic ties with South Africa.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites have
established a racially segregated society and the 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   Botha and Chissano were to discuss a mutual non-aggression
treaty signed by their countries in 1984.
   The treaty lapsed in 1985 when Mozambique produced evidence that
South Africa violated the agreement by continuing to assist the
Mozambique National Resistance, or RENAMO. That guerrilla movement
began an insurgency two years after Mozambique won independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   The civil war, combined with drought, has left millions of
Mozambicans homeless and hungry.
   Many Western governments, including the United States, have
increased aid to Mozambique and support its claim that the rebels
receive covert logistical and communications aid from South Africa.
   South Africa insists it no longer helps the rebels, and Botha
was expected to attempt to persuade Chissano to mute the
allegations.
   Botha was accompanied on his trip by his Defense Minister Gen.
Magnus Malan and Foreign Minister Pik Botha. Chissano's delegation,
which left the capital of Maputo for Songo early today, included
three Cabinet ministers and two military commanders, according to
the Mozambican news agency AIM.
   As part of an effort to improve its regional image, South Africa
has in the past year expanded its trade mission in Maputo and
pursued economic development possibilities in Mozambique.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating the Cahora Bassa project in Tete so South Africa can
purchase power.
   The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from
Cahora Bassa to South Africa.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, Mozambique and
South Africa maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in South Africa,
and Maputo's electricity is supplied by South Africa.
   During his 10 years in power, Botha has had few chances to
travel in black Africa. In 1986, he was one of numerous dignitaries
who attended the coronation of Swaziland's King Mswati III, and in
1987 he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in
Angola.
   He had hoped to visit Brazzaville, Congo, earlier this year in
conjunction with peace talks on Angola and South-West Africa, or
Namibia, but Angola's Cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle
the talks if he came.

   In the gnarled branches of ancient
baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from Mozambique peacefully nest,
giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil
war next door.
   During one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland
into marshes this time of year, Manuel Thomo and his family, human
refugees from the war in Mozambique, huddled around a camp fire
beneath the branches of another baobab tree, a temporary home for
them and several other families.
   Rag-clad and diseased, hungry and frightened, more than 400,000
Mozambicans have crossed into neighboring Malawi in the past 17
months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the
government.
   The refugees have abandoned the poorest country in southern
Africa for refuge in the region's second poorest nation.
   ``This is the major refugee problem in Africa south of the
Sahara, excluding Sudan and Somalia,'' said Raymond Mkanda, a
Tanzanian who heads the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
operation in Malawi.
   ``The pressure on the land is pretty heavy. Malawi doesn't have
adequate land for its own people and the refugees are occupying
land normally used for farming.''
   For generations, Mozambicans have been welcomed visitors across
the 1,000 miles of unguarded border they share with the Malawians.
   But fighting between government troops and the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance, more commonly known by the Portuguese acronym
RENAMO, have sent waves of Mozambicans fleeing into Malawi.
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and has a
government based on Marxist theory.
   The refugees have put a strain on Malawian resources and caused
security problems.
   Drought last year has forced Malawi, once one of the Africa's
few food exporters, to look elsewhere for food to feed its own
people.
   Increasingly, men suspected of being RENAMO fighters have
crossed into Malawi to steal livestock and relief rations from the
refugees. A cattle stealing raid in January ended with the deaths
of three Malawian villagers who resisted the raiders, officials
said. They were the first Malawian casualties of the cross-border
intrusions, which also have cost the lives of several Mozambican
refugees.
   Landlocked Malawi is one of Africa's smallest and most densely
populated countries _ nearly 8 million people in the country about
the size of Pennsylvania.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimates the number of
Mozambican refugees in Malawi will reach a 500,000 by the end of
the year.
   ``Half a million refugees in a small country like Malawi is a
very big problem,'' said S.S. Kamvazina, principal secretary in the
Ministry of Health and the chairman of the joint committee
responsible for the refugees' care.
   An estimated 330,000 more Mozambican war refugees are in nearby
Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, according
to the UNHCR.
   Most of the refugees arrive with similar stories of abuse from
both sides in the Mozambican conflict.
   Government troops accuse civilians of collaborating with the
rebels and take reprisals. RENAMO fighters, in turn, frequently
force villagers to carry supplies on long marches. The civilians
who falter or weaken are beaten or killed, some of the refugees
have charged.
   ``Some of the refugees take weeks wandering through the
countryside to avoid fighting,'' Mkanda said.
   For others, it's a short walk across an asphalt ribbon known as
M1, Malawi's major north-south road connecting the capital,
Lilongwe, with Blantyre, the country's largest town.
   For 60 miles, M1 serves as the border between Malawi and
Mozambique.
   Lush fields of maize (corn) and other crops crowd both sides of
the road.
   But while mud huts dot the landscape on the Malawian side,
abandoned buildings and deserted huts line the Mozambican side.
   The former owners have fled, taking tin from the roofs and
windows from the buildings to use in build new homes on the Malawi
side of the road.
   During the day, some Mozambicans venture across the road to work
their old fields, but never too far inland to risk running into a
rebel or government patrol.
   Mozambicans living along M1 were among the first to flee the
fighting. That first mass movement, in September 1986, brought
40,000 refugees to Malawi. Three months later, the number had
nearly doubled and by March 1987 it reached 100,000.
   Over the next 12 months the refugee population quadrupled.
   ``It's very difficult for the government to cope with the
problem,'' said Kamvanzina, the Health Ministry official. ``We get
no notice that tomorrow so many people are coming in.''
   More than 168,000 Mozambicans have settled here in the
southernmost district of Nsanje, the largest refugee concentration.
Refugees now outnumber the local population and the surrounding
mountainsides are being denuded by the newcomers who fell trees for
firewood and huts.
   Because of the influx _ as many as 100 a day _ it takes up to 10
days for officials to build even temporary shelter for the new
arrivals. Many of the refugees in the teeming camp near Mangkokwe
wear clothing fashioned from burlap sacks that once held their
rations.
   ``Those who are coming in now are in terrible condition _
malnutrition, no clothes, tuberculosis,'' said District
Commissioner Geoff Mwanja, the chief government officer for Nsanje.
``War has reduced human beings to beasts. If there was a way of
ending this thing, it would be very, very nice.''
   The U.N. refugee commission has budgeted $13 million for Malawi
in 1988 _ a ``seriously conservative figure,'' Mkanda said.
   International aid has started to pour in, including $1.2 million
from the U.S. Agency for Internationnal Development.
   ``Repatriation is the most durable solution,'' Mkanda said.
   Nobody expects that soon.
   ``They might be here for some time _ five years, 10 years,''
Mkanda said. ``Even if there is change tomorrow in Mozambique, that
doesn't mean that everybody will leave.''

   Pope John Paul II, his shoulders
draped with a leopard skin, on Sunday urged the Marxist government
and rebels to end their 12-year civil war and called for
international aid to rebuild the country.
   ``I felt the heart of the people bleed,'' the pope told Roman
Catholic bishops, criticized by the government for advocating
negotiations with the Mozambique National Resistance rebels.
   During the last full day of a 10-day trip through southern
Africa, the pope comforted victims whose limbs were blown off by
land mines, celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium decked with
political banners and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 5,000
when he blessed an orphanage in a slum of reed huts.
   He met with anti-apartheid clergy leaders from neighboring South
Africa, which Mozambique's government has accused of aiding the
guerrilla insurgency. The civil war began shortly after Mozambique
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' he
said, urging citizens of this nation on the Indian Ocean coast of
southeastern Africa to follow ``the path of dialogue and
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among
brothers.''
   Addressing himself to the rebels, the pope said: ``Abandon the
paths of violence and vengeance. Put aside destructive action and
try to save what's left.''
   The government, he said, ``should make efforts in the sense of
building.''
   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the
international community,'' he said. ``Let me stress the urgency of
this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacification and immediate
aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.''
   The government accuses the guerrillas of massacres and
destruction of crops. The rebels deny such charges.
   Among the crowd of about 50,000 were the anti-apartheid church
leaders from South Africa, including the Rev. Allan Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Rev.
Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches. They are leaders of a civil disobedience campaign
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid, South Africa's
system of racial segregation.
   Boesak and Chikane, at a news conference following the meeting
with the pope, criticized John Paul for meeting with South African
authorities.
   Boesak suggested that the pope should have made more explicit
criticisms of apartheid during his 10-day tour of southern Africa,
which included an unscheduled stop in South Africa because of bad
weather in Lesotho.
   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was a
propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained
previously about the omission of their country from the official
itinerary.
   Chikane said at the news conference that the pope had met with
officials who were ``persecuting us'' and had been escorted by
``people who torture us.''
   Banners at Machava Sports Stadium bore slogans such as
``Apartheid is the Nazism of our era'' and ``One does not negotiate
the motherland, one defends it.''
   During his homily, the pope said Mozambique should be afforded
``peace from the outside, of an ideological, military and economic
nature'' _ an apparent reference to South Africa, which has been
accused of using a variety of tactics to harrass Mozambique.
   The pope wore a leopard skin, a symbol of power to many
Africans. Most of the crowd at the stadium joined a 300-strong
choir in singing the hymn ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus' in the
Tsonga language, to the accompaniment of drums and hand-clapping.
   Gifts of ivory carvings, fruit and a brass chalice were carried
up a red-carpeted stairway to the altar. Children released balloons
and white doves, one of which alighted briefly on the head of a
white-robed priest.
   The pontiff, who returns to Rome on Monday, has visited
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and made a brief,
unscheduled stop in South Africa when his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The war in Mozambique has forced 2 million of the 14.5 million
population to flee their homes and left millions more in need for
foreign food aid.
   Mozambique has been campaigning for more international relief
aid. Food and other supplies do not always reach the rural areas
where they are needed because of attacks by guerrillas and
transportation difficulties.
   John Paul offered $50,000 to patients at Maputo Central
Hospital, where he visited six wards before the Mass. He blessed
and gave Vatican medals to amputees and other victims of guerrilla
attacks, and he kissed children lying in their beds.
   ``I suffer because you are suffering and it is not in my power
to cure you,'' the pope said.
   In July, the Vatican tried to encourage peace efforts in
Mozambique by sending one of John Paul's top aides to meet
separately with Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and South
African President P.W. Botha.
   Chissano met the pope last May in Rome, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to advancing the peace process.
   About one-eighth of Mozambique's people are Catholic. The
government does nothing to promote or encourage religion, but
tolerates the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups and
has been working to improve strained relations.
   The government recently returned places of worship that it said
were mistakenly confiscated during a period of nationalization
following independence. But hospitals and schools formerly run by
churches remain nationalized.

   On the eve of Pope John Paul II's fourth
African visit, bishops from nine nations on Thursday urged the
Marxist Mozambique government to talk peace with right-wing rebels.
   
   Archbishop Jaime Goncalves, president of the nine-nation
Inter-Regional Meeting of Bishops of Southern Africa, said ongoing
negotiations to end the 13-year conflict in Angola set the stage
for peaceful dialogue in Mozambique.
   ``Considering the situation in this region where people are
trying to solve conflict through dialogue, Mozambique should also
take part in calling people together to talk about ending the
war,'' Goncalves said. ``Mozambique should take the opportunity
now.''
   Goncalves, addressing a news conference in the capital of
Harare, said the Mozambique government refused to meet with leaders
of the Mozambique National Resistance, also known by the Portuguese
acronym RENAMO.
   Some 70 bishops from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe are gathered in Harare for the meeting.
   The pope will close the 10-day meeting Saturday at the beginning
of his first tour of five black-governed nations neighboring
white-ruled South Africa.
   Goncalves denied the Catholic Church in Mozambique was in direct
confrontation with the government in Maputo.
   ``At first the government said they did not agree with the
Catholic Church. Now they say they understand the position of the
church,'' Goncalves said.
   Mozambique won independence from Portugal in 1975 after
centuries of colonial rule and a decade of guerrilla war waged by
Marxist rebels of Frelimo, the Mozambique Liberation Front. The
front is now the ruling party.
   Frelimo at independence accused the Catholic Church of siding
with the Portuguese in that conflict, but relations between church
and state have since warmed.
   Goncalves said the bishops discussed ``the problem of peace'' in
southern Africa, in line with the theme of the Pope's visit. The
papal tour will emphasize human rights in a region split by ``war
and injustice,'' Goncalves said.
   ``The church must consider what we can do for peace, justice and
welfare in this region,'' said Goncalves, who heads the Catholic
diocese of Beira. That port city is in northern Mozambique, where
RENAMO rebels have been blamed for the slaying of thousands of
civilians.
   The pontiff is scheduled to visit Mozambique before returning to
Rome on Sept. 19.
   Mozambique has accused South Africa of backing RENAMO, a charge
denied by Pretoria.
   Zimbabwe has about 12,000 troops fighting alongside government
forces in Mozambique and has repeatedly opposed dialogue with the
rebels.
   Both the Harare and Maputo governments argue the guerrillas have
no specific ideological aims and are simply terrorists supported by
South Africa.

   Local militiamen and soldiers from
neighboring Zimbabwe stand guard over a pipeline, railroad and
crumbling highway. In the soporific heat, they talk of past
campaigns and the possibility of peace.
   There was a time when the enemy, an ubiquitous rebel army
accused of many atrocities, launched attacks of 1,000 men on the
three facilities, which are lifelines to the sea for Mozambique's
inland neighbors.
   For the last few months, quiet has prevailed in the Beira
Corridor ascending from the port of Beira, through nearly 200 miles
of fertile savanna flecked with forests and swamps, to the Vumba
Mountains of Zimbabwe.
   Observers suggest the rebels, who remain active on either side
of the zone, prefer to attack poorly equipped government troops
rather than the heavily armed Zimbabwean military.
   ``We have a few firings along the road, that's all,'' said Col.
Michael Dube, one of the men commanding several thousand Zimbabwean
soldiers who have helped guard the transportation corridor since
1984.
   About 12,000 Zimbabwean troops are scattered throughout
Mozambique to help government forces.
   Dube's troops make routine seven-day foot patrols from Lamego, a
mosquito-infested base camp on the edge of swamps about 45 miles
inland from the Indian Ocean coast.
   Armored convoys run another 110 miles westward to the Zimbabwean
brigade headquarters at Chimoio, just across the border, carrying
supplies to the soldiers and Mozambican militia posts.
   The corridor has remained open through most of the war, closing
only long enough for repairs to the railway after mine explosions
and other sabotage by the guerrillas, who began fighting in 1977.
   Two Beira-bound trains trundle along the corridor most days,
carrying potash and railroad ties from Botswana, tin and cobalt
from Zaire and Zimbabwean tobacco and granite. Trucks overloaded
with Zambian copper pound along the highway.
   Western donors and investors have contributed more than $400
million since 1986 for repairs to the transport system and
rebuilding Beira's port and infrastructure.
   Keeping soldiers in Mozambique costs Zimbabwe about $20 million
a year, according to official figures, and up to seven times that
by private estimates. Zimbabwe is infinitely better off than
Mozambique, but still is among the world's poorer nations.
   White settlers who ruled Zimbabwe when it was a British colony
called Rhodesia helped establish the rebel force to fight
Mozambique's Marxist government. Mozambique became independent of
Portugal in 1975, two years before Renamo was formed.
   South Africa later became Renamo's main supporter, with the aim
of undermining Mozambique economically, and openly supported the
guerrillas until the two governments signed a peace agreement in
1984. No government now acknowledges aiding Renamo.
   President Joachim Chissano's ruling party, known as Frelimo,
officially dropped its hard-line Marxist policies in 1989. In July,
the government said Mozambique's first multiparty elections would
be held next year.
   Renamo has demanded recognition by the government and free
Western-style elections, but has not made its political aims clear.
The guerrillas will be allowed to participate in the 1991 elections
if they lay down their arms.
   The war has killed an estimated 600,000 Mozambicans, displaced
more than 1 million and made the southeast African nation one of
the poorest in the world. Nearly half the 15 million people require
some food assistance and per capita income is less than $200 a year.
   Peace talks have begun in Rome between the government and exiled
rebel leaders, but Col. Dube's men wait for peace with little cheer
or optimism.
   He and his junior officers sipped Dao, a cheap Portuguese red
wine, in a tidy dining tent and said peace would not come easily.
   Zimbabwean soldiers, with their far superior firepower,
equipment and air support, have little faith in Mozambican
government troops.
   ``When there's trouble, the first thing Frelimo do is run
away,'' said Dube, a Soviet-trained veteran of his own country's
war for independence, which ended a decade ago.
   A young officer, who asked not to be identified, said
militiamen, soldiers and rebels alike turned to banditry.
   The Zimbabweans have been accused of using armored vehicles,
which are seldom searched, to smuggle out ivory, gemstones,
valuable carvings and marijuana, which grows wild in central and
northern Mozambique.

<HL> South Africa Warms to Marxist Neighbor --- Talks With Mozambique On Reopening Dam Generate Hope </HL>

   The Cahora Bassa Dam, a huge hydroelectric plant spanning the Zambezi River in northwest Mozambique, is capable of producing enough power to satisfy all of this country's energy requirements and 8% of South Africa's needs as well. 

   But for much of the past decade, Cahora Bassa has generated nothing but pity. 
Its mighty turbines, silenced by the sabotage of anti-government rebels nurtured by South Africa, are a sorry monument to Pretoria's habit of destabilizing its neighbors. 
"It's such a shame," says Fernando Juliao, the general manager of Mozambique's state-controlled electricity company. 
"When you think of Cahora Bassa, you always think of political problems." 

   Recently, however, Cahora Bassa has begun generating a current of hope. 
Talks between South Africa, Mozambique and Portugal (which built the dam during its colonial rule here) to rehabilitate the power project have sparked optimism that Pretoria, the dominant political and economic power of southern Africa, is ready to back up its "good neighbor" rhetoric with action. 
If so, a meeting in Lisbon of the three countries this month could complete plans to put Cahora Bassa back on stream by year's end. 

   "If Cahora Bassa goes through, it will be the first concrete achievement of South Africa in regional cooperation," says Melissa Wells, the U.S. ambassador to Mozambique. 
"It will be a milestone and something that should be built upon." 

   Diplomats and government sources in both countries believe that agreement on Cahora Bassa will pave the way for a meeting between Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and South African President P.W. Botha. 
The negotiations over Cahora Bassa, which began in November, already have prompted an unprecedented exchange of letters between the leaders. 
Political and military officials of both countries have held meetings designed to resurrect the Joint Security Commission, a consultative body that collapsed in 1985 over charges by Maputo that South Africa was continuing to support the Mozambican rebels, called Renamo. 

   "Cahora Bassa cuts across everything in our bilateral relations," says Glen Babb, South Africa's deputy director general for foreign affairs. 
"It's a matter of putting mutual interests first." 

   For South Africa, which urgently needs the additional energy capacity Cahora Bassa can supply, the project is ripe with irony. 
"Cahora Bassa is forcing South Africa to take sides in Mozambique," says a Western diplomat in Maputo. 
"If the rehabilitation is to succeed, they have to take a stand against Renamo." 

   Renamo was set up in the mid-1970s by agents of the white Rhodesian government intent on destabilizing the new post-colonial Marxist government in Mozambique. 
When Rhodesia became black-ruled Zimbabwe in 1980, the white government of South Africa began assisting Renamo. 
The rebels soon gained control of much of the Mozambique countryside, and the Cahora Bassa line made an easy target for sabotage. 
Eventually, the power was cut off. 

   To get the power flowing again, South Africa must cooperate with the Mozambican government to protect the line, which runs for 558 miles inside Mozambique, from further Renamo attacks. 
Sources in both countries say South Africa agreed to contribute "nonlethal" aid, such as trucks, mine sweepers, and medical supplies, and to supply the bulk of the $30 million needed for the first phase of rehabilitation. 
Both sides vigorously denied reports that South African advisers will train Mozambican soldiers, though sources say South Africa may need to train a small number of people to use specialized equipment. 

   Still, there are doubts about whether the line, much of which runs through rebel-controlled territory, can be protected without coming to some kind of accommodation with Renamo. 
Mozambican officials, who claim Pretoria still assists the rebels, say it is up to South Africa to tell Renamo to lay off the line. 

   At the moment, though, Renamo seems to be under no one's control in the countryside, making its reaction to the Cahora Bassa rehabilitation unpredictable. 
In apparent protest to the talks, Renamo has attacked a main road leading to Cahora Bassa, making overland travel to the dam unsafe. 
Diplomats here say the rehabilitated line could make an even more inviting target to rebel leaders anxious to prove their independence from South Africa. 

   The South African government insists it severed ties with Renamo after the signing of the Nkomati Accord with Mozambique in 1984. 
Under that agreement, Pretoria promised to cut off aid to Renamo while Mozambique pledged not to harbor guerrillas of the African National Congress, the liberation movement working to topple the South African government. 

   "We do not and will not support Renamo," says David Laubscher, South Africa's trade representative to Mozambique. (The two countries don't have full diplomatic ties.) 
"No matter what the history of Renamo is, or the previous accusations, at this stage the question is to start off and cooperate with Mozambique." 

   South Africa hopes Cahora Bassa's rehabilitation will foster reconciliation talks between the Mozambican government and Renamo. 
Chances for this seem remote, as Maputo, which accuses the rebels of committing atrocities in the countryside, refuses to meet with Renamo. 
But Mr. Babb, the South African official, says Cahora Bassa "will show that reconciliation is the only solution for Mozambique." 

   It also will show, say energy officials from both countries, that reconciliation between the politically hostile states in southern Africa is the only solution for regional economic development. 
South Africa, which uses two-thirds of the electricity consumed on the continent, could use the 1,500 megawatts it can get from Cahora Bassa to allow Eskom, its utility, to defer expenses of building a new power plant. 

   For Mozambique, Cahora Bassa is a domestic power source that will reduce the country's reliance on South African-supplied energy. 
Mozambique currently pays 15 million rand ($6.7 million) a year for electricity from Eskom, almost 10% of Mozambique's annual export earnings. 

   "Anybody with common sense wants to get Cahora Bassa working again," says Mr. Juliao. 
"Look, our political problems can't last forever. 
Even wars have to end sometime."

   Mozambican rebels claimed Monday that
government forces backed by Zimbabwean troops and planes have
launched a major offensive against guerrilla positions in central
Mozambique.
   A statement distributed in the Portuguese capital by the
Mozambican National Resistance said 2,500 Mozambican and Zimbabwean
troops attacked rebel strongholds in the Gorongoza highlands Monday
in Sofala province.
   The statement said the offensive was spearheaded by troops
carried by Zimbabwean transport planes and backed by Soviet-built
combat planes and helicopters.
   The Mozambican news agency AIM reported Saturday that government
forces had destroyed four rebel camps the past week, one in Sofala
and three in the south.
   The AIM report said 57 rebels were killed in the actions, but
gave no indication these were major operations. AIM made no mention
of Zimbabwean troops.
   Rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama is thought to have his headquarters
in Gorongoza, 560 miles north of the capital Maputo.
   The rebels, who are also known by the Portuguese acronym Renamo,
said a column of infantry and artillery was supporting the airborne
troops. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
   The Renamo statement said the attack showed the ``bad faith'' of
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who together with his Kenyan
counterpart Daniel arap Moi has been attempting to mediate
tentative peace moves to end 13 years of fighting in Mozambique.
   Despite intermittent talks between Renamo officials and
Mozambican church leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, since last July,
reports of violent clashes have continued.
   Earlier this month, the government accused Renamo of killing
over 50 civilians in an attack on a train bringing Mozambican
miners from work in neighboring South Africa.
   The rebels have faced repeated accusations of civilian massacres
since they launched their insurgency in 1977, two years after
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal.
   South Africa formerly supported the rebels, but since a 1984
accord between Maputo and Pretoria no government openly backs the
rebels.

<TEXT>
   The United States should act as a
mediator between South Africa and Mozambique in a bid to resolve
Mozambique's 12-year civil war, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said
Tuesday.
   Botha said at a news briefing that the talks should include the
governments of South Africa and Mozambique, with the United States
mediating and the Soviet Union welcome to participate.
   He did not say if the talks should include rebels of the
Mozambique National Resistance, who have been waging a guerrilla war
since 1977 in a bid to undermine the country's Marxist government.
   South Africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s, but says it
halted assistance in 1984 under the terms of a mutual non-aggression
pact with Mozambique.
   Mozambique has accused South Africa of continuing to aid the
rebels, a charge South Africa denies. South African President P.W.
Botha visited Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano in September
and relations have improved during the past year, although
Mozambican officials still contend on occasion that South Africa
continues to support the guerrillas.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have ravaged
Mozambique's economy with hit-and-run attacks on civilian and
military targets.
   Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and an
estimated 6 million of its 15 million people need food aid.
   The United States is the leading donor of aid to Mozambique,
which has increased ties with Western nations in recent years
although most of its weapons come from the Soviet Union.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that (the Mozambique) war will
have to stop,'' Botha said. ``I have no illusions about what is
ahead of us, but I know it can be done.''
   He said he envisioned negotiations similar to last year's talks
on southern Africa involving Cuba, Angola, South Africa and U.S.
mediators. More than a dozen rounds of negotiations culminated in
December with an agreement for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 troops
from Angola and for South Africa to grant independence to Namibia,
or South-West Africa.
   Botha said today that the southern Africa agreement appears on
track. Cuba already has withdrawn more than 3,000 soldiers from
Angola, although it was not required to reach that figure until
April 1.
   South Africa is to begin implementing Namibian independence on
April 1, leading to U.N.-supervised elections Nov. 1.
   The Angolan rebel movement UNITA was not included in the peace
talks and has vowed to continue the 13-year-old war until it has a
power-sharing agreement with Angola's Marxist government.
   It is not clear how the Mozambique National Resistance would
respond to any regional peace agreement in which it did not
participate.

<F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Text] At mass rallies held in the capitals of Malema and 
Lalaua Districts of Nampula Province today, President of the 
Republic Joaquim Chissano said the promoters of war in 
Mozambique have begun to return to the country, because they are 
convinced conditions have already been created to take the reins 
of power. Speaking to large crowds, Chissano mentioned the cases 
of Portuguese nationals currently residing in South Africa and 
Portugal as the ones returning to Mozambique, where they have 
launched a campaign to discredit the Mozambican Government. 
Chissano said the campaign is based on the old colonial 
principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves. 
He said such people have always backed Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] in the destruction of Mozambique, though 
they never believed in the capacity of Afonso Dhlakama's 
movement to govern anything. 
  The president of the republic said the destruction of the 
town of Lalaua, while it was under Renamo occupation for 45 days 
beginning July 1991, was ordered by those who have never 
accepted the country's independence. Chissano was referring to 
people who abandoned Mozambique before and after independence to 
settle in Portugal. 
  The president of the republic warned the residents of the 
two 
towns that in the current multiparty system there are people who 
promote campaigns on behalf of their parties, promising to 
resolve the nation's problems in a short period of time. 
  Chissano's speeches in Malema and Lalaua focused on peace, 
national reconciliation, and hard work on the basis of unity of 
all Mozambicans from north to south of the country. The 
Mozambican head of state accused those who claim that the 
Mozambique Government is formed mainly by southerners, of 
promoting division in the country. Chissano said that that was 
not true, giving as an example the various ministers included in 
his delegation who come from different parts of the country. 
Chissano added: Frelimo chooses competent people for 
government posts, regardless of their ethnic origin. 
  Malema residents demanded from Joaquim Chissano that 
passenger services be revamped along the recently renovated 
Nacala railroad. Nampula residents often travel on tank cars and 
rail cars. The residents also complained about serious cases of 
police brutality at railroad stations. Asked to explain the 
lack of passenger coaches, the director general of the 
Mozambique Railroad enterprise said that there were 200 
passenger coaches in 1975, but today there are only 46 
throughout the country. The others, he said, were destroyed 
during the war. Chissano commented on this issue, saying: those 
who destroyed the rail cars should buy them, instead of asking 
us for money. 
  As in his visits to Gaza, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, the 
president of the republic urged Malema and Lalaua residents to 
vote in large numbers during the October elections to choose the 
best representatives of the Mozambican society for the future 
government. 
  Chissano returned to the city of Nampula this evening. 
Tomorrow, he is scheduled to leave for Nacala where he will 
assess the damage caused by the Nadia cyclone and address a mass 
rally. Chissano will meet the province's businessmen after his 
return from Nacala.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Mozambique peace pact promises end to 16-year civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPPOSING leaders in Mozambique's civil war signed an accord yesterday
which could bring peace to the country for the first time in three decades.
At a ceremony in Rome, President Joaquim Chissano and Mr Afonso Dhlakama,
leader of the Renamo rebels, agreed to end hostilities in the 16-year civil
war by October 1. The war, which followed a guerrilla conflict seeking
independence from Portugal, achieved in 1975, has devastated the already
impoverished country.
War and drought have forced a quarter of the 15m population to flee, and
fighting has seriously hindered efforts to avert starvation.
The six-page agreement, the result of nearly two years of intermittent
talks, calls for the international community and the United Nations in
particular to help monitor the agreement, which provides for Mozambique's
first multiparty elections.
Implementation of the pact will be a formidable task, given the destruction
of the infrastructure and fears that Renamo is not so much an organised
movement as a collection of gangs and warlords. Yesterday's news that Renamo
attacks continued during the latest peace talks may be a symptom of this
kind of indiscipline.
Participants in Rome remained optimistic, however. 'This is an historic day
for the people of Mozambique and Africa . . . Please, no more deaths,' said
Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who, with church leaders and the Italian
government, helped arrange the pact.
President Mugabe and President Chissano paid tribute at the signing to the
role played in the long peace process by Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of
Lonrho, the British conglomerate. 'Well done, Tiny,' said Mr Mugabe,
embracing Mr Rowland, while Mr Chissano spoke of 'our friend Tiny'.
Lonrho has big commercial, agro-industrial and mining interests in
Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Mr Rowland's involvement in the peace process goes
back over two years, when he arranged the first meeting of the two sides in
Malawi. He has also been trying to mediate in the Sudanese civil war.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Cuban Troops Enter Mozambique</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels claimed Saturday that
hundreds of Cuban combat troops have entered the southern African
country to help government forces fighting in the country's
12-year-old civil war.
   A Mozambican National Resistance statement said almost 600 Cuban
soldiers have arrived in Maputo in the past week and warned the
presence complicates ongoing peace talks.
   There was no immediate comment on the claims from President
Joaquim Chissano's Marxist government.
   Peace talks between the guerrilla organization and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government resumed this week in
Nairobi, Kenya. No details of the negotiations have been released by
either side or Kenyan mediators.
   During talks last month, the two sides said they exchanged peace
plans.
   The rebel statement, released in Lisbon and signed by the rebel's
resident delegate Manuel Frank, said the Cubans are members of
motorized infantry units. It said they arrived between Aug. 25 and
Monday in the Mozambican capital and more are slated to arrive next
week.
   According to Frank, government officials claim the Cubans are
Mozambicans returning from training in East Germany.
   The rebel claims come as Cuba is involved in a phased withdrawal
of about 50,000 troops in another southern African country, Angola,
under an agreement in exchange for South Africa pulling out its
troops from Angola and granting Namibia independence.
   Mozambique receives military aid from the Soviet Union and its
allies and has accepted several hundred Soviet, Cuban and East
German advisers.
   But the only foreign troops known to be fighting the rebels
alongside Mozambican government forces at present are 12,000
Zimbabwean soldiers protecting an oil pipeline and road and rail
links from Mozambique's Indian Ocean ports to their landlocked
nation.
   Saturday's guerrilla statement said the government has yet to
answer the rebels' call for direct talks.
   South Africa used to back Mozambique's guerrillas, but says it
ended its support in 1984 when it signed a mutual non-aggression
pact with Mozambique.
   No government now openly supports the rebels, who are accused of
widespread atrocities against civilians.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha will make
his first official visit to neighboring, Marxist-ruled Mozambique,
the countries said Friday.
   Botha's meeting Monday with Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano will underscore the improving relations between the
long-hostile countries, although Mozambique continues to charge
that South Africa supports an 11-year-old guerrilla insurgency in
Mozambique.
   Botha, during his 10 years as head of South Africa's
white-controlled government, has paid an official visit to
Swaziland and made a secret visit to South African troops fighting
in Angola.
   But he has not made an official state visit to neighboring
Botswana, Mozambique or Zimbabwe, three of the so-called front-line
states that vehemently oppose South Africa's apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   Mozambique's national news agency AIM, quoting unidentified
official sources in Maputo, said Botha and Chissano would meet in
the town of Songo, in the far-northern province of Tete.
   The South African Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed
Botha's visit, but did not release any details. The department also
said Botha would travel Tuesday to Malawi, the only African nation
that has full diplomatic relations with South Africa.
   The sources quoted by AIM said Botha and Chissano would discuss
``matters of common interest'' and would meet ``in the spirit of
the Nkomati Accord.''
   The accord is a mutual non-aggression treaty signed in 1984 by
Botha and Chissano's predecessor, Samora Machel, during a ceremony
at the two countries' border.
   Machel was killed in a plane crash on South African territory in
October 1986. Mozambique blamed South Africa for the crash, saying
a false radio beacon lured the plane off course, but a South
African-organized panel of international experts blamed the
accident on errors by the Soviet crew.
   Chissano, chosen in November 1986 to succeed Machel, has
increased Mozambique's contacts with the West, which now provides
extensive aid to the war- and drought-wracked country.
   The Soviet bloc continues to supply weaponry and military
training, but most Western governments support Chissano's
government and have denounced the often brutal tactics of the
rebels.
   Mozambique has repeatedly accused South Africa of violating the
1984 Nkomati Accord by assisting the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrilla movement. South Africa, which aided the rebels before the
accord, says it has halted the assistance.
   In the past year, South Africa has expanded its trade mission in
Maputo, pursued economic development possibilities in Mozambique
and revived a joint military monitoring commission established in
the Nkomati Accord.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating a giant hydroelectric project near Songo so it can
purchase electricity from Mozambique.
   The Mozambique National Resistance rebels repeatedly have
sabotaged the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric project.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, Mozambique and
South Africa maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in South Africa,
and Maputo's electricity is supplied by South Africa.
   Botha's trip comes four days before the arrival in Mozambique of
Pope John Paul II, who will be making a three-day tour at the close
of a regional trip.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Leonel Matias in Maputo on the </F>
"London Last Minute" program] 
  [Text] President Joaquim Chissano has admitted publicly for 
the first time that the Mozambican Government could make use of 
force against neighboring Malawi in connection with the alleged 
illegal entry into Mozambican territory of armed Malawi Young 
Pioneers [MYP] men, who belong to Malawi's ruling Congress 
Party, MCP. This is the first such statement to have been made 
by the Mozambican head of state since those Malawian youths 
allegedly came into Mozambique at the end of last year and since 
the two governments had met in January and agreed to cooperate 
to settle the problem. Speaking to Mozambican Television, 
President Joaquim Chissano had this to say: 
  [Begin Chissano recording] With regard to the use of force 
by 
us, everything depends on the outcome of those efforts to settle 
the problem. If the outcome dictates the need to use force, 
then it will be the country's duty to defend its territorial 
integrity. I think, though, that it will not be necessary to go 
that far. [end recording] 
  There are contradictory reports concerning the alleged entry 
of armed MYP men into Mozambican territory. Some government 
sources have already accused the Mozambique National Resistance, 
Renamo, of giving shelter to those youths. Renamo has, however, 
challenged the government to tell the United Nations where those 
men are. Other reports say that those MYP men were placed in 
Mozambique to be used at a later stage to destabilize Malawi, 
should the ruling MCP lose. This is the first major incident 
between the two countries ever since Mozambique threatened to 
place missiles along the border. The Mozambican Government had 
said at the time that Malawi was involved in a major Renamo 
military offensive aimed at creating the so-called Republic of 
Rombezia. 
  However, the Mozambican Government is also having a bad time 
of relations with neighboring Zimbabwe. Maputo is annoyed about 
the fact that the Zimbabwean Government led by Robert Mugabe, 
who fought his war of independence with the support of the 
Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, and later helped the 
Frelimo government in its war against Renamo, should now be 
giving greater attention to relations with Renamo.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Mozambique
rebels has called off peace talks with Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano's government.
   Afonso Dhlakama, head of the Mozambique National Resistance,
said on South African television Sunday the rebels would not take
part in the talks because government soldiers, backed by troops
from Zimbabwe, had started a new offensive against the rebels.
   The rebels have been battling Mozambique's government since
1977. They say they are seeking recognition as a political party
and free elections. But the rebels' political goals have never been
clear; they have been accused of widespread atrocities against
civilians.
   Periodic peace talks have been held in Rome. There have been no
breakthroughs, but more negotiations were expected.
   Zimbabwean troops have been assisting the Mozambique government
for several years. Their primary aim is to help protect
Mozambique's Beira corridor railroad, which is landlocked
Zimbabwe's shortest route to the Indian Ocean.
   The Mozambican war has left the southeastern African country one
of the poorest in the world. Annual per capita income is less than
$200 and almost half the 15 million people require some food
assistance.
   Chissano, a former Marxist, has been making political and
economic reforms. Mozambique's parliament is debating a new
constitution that would allow opposition parties to compete in
elections next year.

   Rebels fighting the Marxist government of
Mozambique are still getting aid from South Africa, a State
Department official said Wednesday.
   But Alison Rosenberg, deputy assistant secretary for Africa, said
she didn't know the source of the money or how much was being sent.
   ``We've done our best to publicize our views in Mozambique and
we've told the South Africans of our concern,'' Ms. Rosenberg told
the House Foreign Affairs African subcommittee.
   The Mozambique National Resistance, known by its Portuguese
acronym of RENAM0, has been fighting the government for 12 years,
starting shortly after the nation won independence from Portugal.
Thousands of Portuguese colonists fled Mozambique to neighboring
South Africa and many support RENAMO.
   The Mozambique news agency AIM says 600,000 people, most of them
children, have died as a result of the fighting. Refugees estimated
at 800,000 to 1 million have fled to Malawi.
   Mozambique and Malawi are among the world's poorest countries.
The average citizen earns about $150 a year, according to the World
Bank.
   But Edward V. K. Jaycox, the bank's vice president for Africa,
listed both among the African countries where incomes are beginning
to improve after a decade or more of decline. At a news conference
Wednesday, he singled out Malawi for what he called a tremendous
performance despite the burden of caring for the refugees.
   South Africa, where the average annual income reached $1,890 in
1987, is among the most prosperous African countries.
   In 1984, Mozambique and South Africa agreed that South African
aid to the rebels would cease and Mozambique would expel guerrillas
of the African National Congress who attack South Africa.
   ``We support the accord,'' Ms. Rosenberg said.
   The Mozambique government has charged South Africa with violating
the agreement.
   Last month, U.S. officials welcomed a call by South African
Foreign Minister Pik Botha for the United States to mediate the
fighting. E. Gibson Lanpher, the State Department's top official for
southern Africa, said he wanted to find out if Botha's proposal
included RENAMO.
   Botha said he envisioned negotiations like those of last year on
southwest Africa. They included representatives of Cuba, Angola,
South Africa and U.S. mediators and resulted in an agreement that
South Africa would begin the grant of independence to Namibia on
April 1.

   Howard Ruff says in his Jan. 20 letter that Renamo represents the anti-communist resistance forces in Mozambique, is an indigenous movement and is supported by the majority of Mozambicans. 
Well, is this the view of the U.S. government? 

   Here are excerpts from the testimony of Chester A. Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, before the Subcommittee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, June 24, 1987:
   "Another persistent myth about Mozambique holds that the insurgent movement Renamo is a democratic alternative to the government of Mozambique. 
Here again, a little history is in order. 

   "Renamo was created by the Rhodesian secret services in 1977 to punish Mozambique for the country's assistance to Zimbabwean liberation movements. 
With Zimbabwean independence in 1980, sponsorship of Renamo was taken over by the South African Defense Force . . . 

   "Renamo appears to draw most of its adherents from the Ndau-Shona tribal group of central Mozambique. 
It has shown little capability to expand its political influence in other areas of the country or to create a cohesive political organization, even in areas where it has ethnic support. 
Credible reports of Renamo atrocities against the civilian population have undercut its popular appeal, as have increasingly apparent divisions among its military and political leaders." 

   Let your readers judge who is accurately describing Renamo.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Drops References To Marxism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Frelimo party presented a
new policy document Friday that drops all references to Marxism,
Leninism and Western imperialism.
   The document, submitted at the party's first national congress
since 1983, says Frelimo, the Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, remains committed to socialism. But it deletes
references to ``the class struggle'' and says party members should
``express the aspirations of the entire people.''
   The alterations coincide with a new drive by the government to
end a 12-year-old civil war that has devastated the economy and
left millions of Mozambicans dead, displaced or dependent on food
aid.
   President Joaquim Chissano has asked Presidents Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe and Daniel arap Moi of Kenya to arrange for preliminary
peace talks with rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance.
   For many years, Mozambican authorities have accused neighboring
South Africa of supporting the rebels, but Chissano said this month
he was prepared to accept assurances that the South African
government no longer sanctioned such aid.
   Frelimo took power in 1975 after a prolonged guerrilla war
against Portuguese colonial rule. Frelimo leaders established a
one-party, Marxist-Leninist state and described themselves in a
1983 policy document as ``the vanguard of the worker-peasant
alliance.''
   The new document describes the party as ``the vanguard of the
Mozambican people'' and deletes a previous reference to
Mozambique's role in a ``world anti-imperialist front.''
   That change reflects Mozambique's improving relations with
Western countries such as the United States, Italy and Britain,
which supply substantial quantities of aid.
   Mozambique's government has maintained its close ties with the
Soviet Union and other East bloc countries. The new policy document
calls for ``an independent foreign policy based on the defense of
national interests.''
   The government for several years has been moving to end central
control of the economy. It has met loan conditions from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and has experienced
modest growth in the past two years after a decade of sharp decline.
   Frelimo also has proposed allowing businessmen, property owners,
shopkeepers and religious believers to join the party after years
of poor relations.
   About 200,000 of Mozambique's 15 million people belong to
Frelimo.

   Mozambican rebels claimed Friday that
Zimbabwean warplanes bombed rebel-held territory in western
Mozambique and killed 129 civilians.
   No immediate comment was available from Zimbabwe, which like
Tanzania has troops helping President Joaquim Chissano's Marxist
government fight the right-wing Mozambique National Resistance.
   A rebel statement distributed in Lisbon, Portugal, said the May
21 and 30 attacks in Tete, Manica and Gaza provinces are an attempt
to force civilians to seek refuge in government-controlled areas.
   Soviet-built MiG-21 jet fighters and Mi-8 helicopters were used
in the attack, the rebels said.
   The Mozambique National Resistance regularly denies accusations
that its guerrillas commit widespread atrocities against civilians
in the hit-and-run insurgency they have waged since 1977, after
Portugal gave Mozambique its independence.
   South Africa denies it is continuing aid for the rebels despite
signing a non-aggression pact with Mozambique in 1984.

<TEXT>
TO suffer one war can be disastrous. To experience four in less than three
decades accounts for the catastrophe that is Mozambique.
But if this week's peace accord - a belated consequence of the complex peace
process under way in southern Africa - is put into effect, recovery can at
last begin. Behind it lie the end of superpower rivalry and the proxy
battles it led to, and the South African government's decision to negotiate
a post-apartheid constitution.
For Mozambique, however, the benefits have been a long time coming, and its
tribulations go back many years.
The guerrilla campaign that won independence from Portugal in 1975 proved a
pyrrhic victory, triggering an exodus of hundreds of thousands of whites,
many of whom sabotaged what they were forced to leave behind, leaving the
country bereft of skills.
Ill equipped for independence after centuries of Portuguese misrule,
Mozambique's plight deepened when it took the part of rebels in the conflict
in neighbouring Rhodesia.
Rhodesian retaliation took two forms: attacking guerrilla bases and economic
targets such as power stations and bridges, and creating Renamo, the rebel
group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, co-signatory to yesterday's agreement.
Rhodesia's emergence as independent Zimbabwe in 1980 brought no respite.
South Africa took over its role as the backer of Renamo, training and
supplying a loosely organised army of local war lords, renegades and
defectors from the ruling Frelimo party.
By then Mozambique was playing a frontline role once more, providing a
secure base for the military wing of the African National Congress (ANC) of
South Africa.
But by 1984, enervated by civil conflict and Pretoria's attacks, Mozambique
submitted to her powerful neighbour. In May 1984 the late President Samora
Machel and the then South African president, Mr PW Botha, signed the Nkomati
non-aggression pact.
Unconsulted and unprepared, the ANC was bundled out of Mozambique. In
return, South African assistance to Renamo was to end.
It never did. Covert aid to the rebels continued at least until President FW
de Klerk took office in South Africa in 1989, and there is some doubt
whether it ended then.
The seeds of Renamo were the black soldiers who had served Portugal's cause
in the run-up to independence, many of whom took sanctuary in Rhodesia. But
they fell on fertile ground. Popular at first, Frelimo steadily alienated
many of its supporters, by mismanagement of the economy, its authoritarian
style, or by ignoring or overriding the wishes of traditional community
leaders.
Renamo, tutored by US and South African advisers, refined its ideology,
portraying itself as a movement that stood for multiparty democracy and a
market economy.
And although it is renowned for its brutality, in recent years its claim to
grass-roots support has gained credibility. But whoever wins the promised
elections that lie ahead will inherit an impoverished nation deeply scarred
by war.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Ambush Train From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rightist rebels ambushed a passenger
train en route from South Africa to Maputo, killing eight people and
injuring 38, Mozambique's national news agency AIM reported Thursday.
   State radio blamed Wednesday's attack on ``forces within South
Africa'' trying to wreck an ongoing peace initiative between
Marxist-ruled Mozambique and South Africa.
   In South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha condemned the bombing
and reiterated that his government no longer supports the guerrilla
Mozambican National Resistance.
   In a statement, Botha said South Africa is opposed to violence as
a means of settling the Mozambique conflict.
   AIM said the train hit a land mine 30 miles northwest of Maputo
then was fired on by rebels, who have waged a hit-and-run insurgency
since 1977.
   President Joaquim Chissano's government contended South Africa
violated a 1984 non-aggression pact and continued to aid the
guerrillas. But relations between the neighbors have improved.
Chissano and South African President P.W. Botha held a summit
meeting in September and Pik Botha last month opened new offices for
Pretoria's trade mission in Maputo.
   A Radio Mozambique commentary said unspecified elements in South
Africa were helping the rebels in attempts to destroy the peace
initiative.
   ``The forces that command banditry, at whatever level they are to
be found within South African society, are telling us through the
explosions of these mines, the rattle of these machine guns, that
they do not want peace and cooperation between Mozambique and South
Africa,'' the radio said. ``They want war, death and destruction.''
   Mozambican sources in the past have suggested a possible split
within the South African government regarding Mozambique, with
relatively moderate Foreign Affairs officials favoring rapprochement
and some military officers wanting covert aid for the rebels to keep
Mozambique weak.

<DATELINE>NAMPULA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, mired in a civil war
that is sinking the country ever deeper into poverty and famine, is
making overtures toward its two main enemies.
   The 12-year-old war is stalemated, and Mozambique's Marxist
leaders now appear interested in making a deal with South Africa to
complement generous amnesty terms offered to rebels of the
Mozambique National Resistance.
   Since the amnesty law took effect in December, an estimated 500
to 700 guerrillas have surrendered with a government promise that
they will be not be punished for their war activities.
   Also, Mozambique's president, Joachim Chissano, sent Cooperation
Minister Jacinto Veloso to South Africa on April 26 with a
conciliatory message for President P.W. Botha. The possibility of a
summit meeting was discussed.
   A day earlier, Chissano met with Gavin Relly, chairman of South
Africa's giant Anglo American Corp., to discuss possible business
ventures.
   Chissano continues to accuse South Africa of supporting the
rebels in violation of a 1984 non-aggression pact, a charge
Pretoria denies.
   However, Mozambique's decision to renew high-level contacts with
South Africa suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the
war, which the U.S. State Department says has claimed an estimated
100,000 lives in the past three years.
   The fighting in northeastern Nampula province, visited recently
by a group of Western journalists, is representative of the
deadlocked war in many parts of Mozambique.
   The rebels roam the countryside at will, attacking villages to
obtain supplies and often kidnapping residents as forced laborers.
   Government troops fight an almost entirely defensive war,
attempting to protect economic installations and to keep
transporation routes open, but seldom seeking out the rebels in the
bush.
   Eighteen of the 21 district capitals in Nampula province have
been attacked since last October. Refugee camps are swelling and
food is in short supply in most areas. Hospitals dispense aspirin
and anti-malaria tablets, but not much else.
   Repeated rebel sabotage on the railway that runs across the
province prompted a European consortium to halt repair work until
the government can guarantee their security.
   ``The frequent attacks disrupt the villages and discourage
people from staying and planting crops,'' said Jacob Jeremiah
Nyambir, the provincial governor. ``We are trying to reorganize the
military and stabilize the civilian situation.''
   Nyambir and other local officials cited several incidents that
highlight the military's shortcomings.
   Nyambir pointed on a map to the three main rebel camps in
Nampula province, but said the military has never been able to
carry out attacks against the locations.
   When rebels raided the northern coastal city of Angoche last
year, they they were repelled by the military, local officials
said. However, the rebels kidnapped 300 civilians and the army made
no attempt to pursue them.
   Because of poor communications, word of rebel attacks on remote
villages can take a week to reach the city of Nampula, the
provincial capital, Nyambir said.
   He said the provincial government has been unable to promote the
amnesty campaign because Nampula's radio station isn't powerful
enough to broadcast much beyond the city limits and leaflets
haven't been published because the printing press is broken.
   Nonetheless, 16 rebels seeking amnesty turned up in the town of
Moma on April 9, but local authorities had no idea what to do with
them, Nyambir said. It took a week before someone could reach
Nampula and receive instructions on how to handle the surrendered
men.
   The war has made Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the
world and is the primary cause of a famine in which an almost 6
million of the country's 14.5 million people need food assistance.
   There are more than a million refugees inside the country and
700,000 Mozambicans have fled to neighboring states, including
South Africa.
   The rebel movement, created in 1977 by what was then white-ruled
Rhodesia, opposes the Marxist policies of the FRELIMO party
government, but beyond that its aims are vague.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels and they appear
to have generated little support among the civilian population with
their repeated raids on villages in which they often kidnap
residents and force them to carry supplies and grow food at rebel
bases.
   ``Nowhere have I found support (for the guerrillas),'' said U.S.
Ambassador Melissa Wells. ``I've only found fear and terror.''
   Those who have been kidnapped say the guerrillas make little
effort to explain their positions.
   ``They showed me a picture of their leader and told me that when
they come to power everyone will have a car,'' said Luciano Alouta,
31, who was kidnapped by the rebels in July and escaped a month
later. ``I did not believe what they told me or understand what
they were fighting for.''
   The rebels threatened to kill anyone who left their camp and
made no attempt to become friendly with the captured civilians,
Alouta said.
   Refugees at several different camps in Nampula told similar
stories. In the town of Ribaue, some residents said they sleep in
the surrounding woods to avoid being kidnapped in one of the rebels
frequent nighttime attacks. The hospital and the local
administration building were destroyed, but a cotton gin manages to
keep going, despite four guerrilla raids in the past year.
   The nearby village of Lalaua sits empty following a rebel attack
in early April in which 50 huts, about a quarter of the village,
were burned. The rebels did not occupy the village, but residents
are afraid to return, saying they fear a repeat attack.

   Police today hunted the killers of a
Mozambican rebel leader, and the rebels accused Mozambique's
Marxist government of assassinating him.
   Evo Fernandes, an influential figure in the Mozambican National
Resistance, was shot five times before his body was dumped outside
Lisbon, police said.
   The body was found Thursday on a country road about 20 miles
west of Lisbon after he met with suspected agents of the Mozambican
government, his wife said.
   Lisbon's Judiciary Police said in a statement today that
Fernandes had been shot once above the left eye, three times around
the heart and once in the stomach.
   The statement said police were investigating several clues they
expected to shed light on the crime.
   In a statement issued in Lisbon today, the rebels blamed the
Mozambican government for ``the barbarous crime.'' The government
of the southern African nation denied the allegation.
   The rebels, also known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO, have
been fighting a guerrilla war since 1977 to topple Mozambique's
government. Guerrilla representatives operate in Portugal, the
colonial ruler of Mozambique until 1975.
   Hundreds of police had been searching for Fernandes since
Monday, when his wife, Yvette, said he disappeared after meeting
two men who said the Mozambican government had empowered them to
initiate peace talks with the rebels.
   Fernandes, a founder and former secretary-general of RENAMO,
believed the two men he dined with Sunday were authorized to
approach him to set up negotiations with Mozambican officials, his
wife said.
   When her husband failed to return, Mrs. Fernandes said Monday
she believed he had been abducted by Mozambican security agents.
   Mozambican Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said today his
government had no connection with the killing.
   Mozambique ``does not commit acts of terrorism,'' he told the
official news agency AIM. He suggested that Fernandes was killed as
a result of ``splits and conflicts'' within RENAMO.
   Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro condemned the
assassination.
   Mozambique and Angola have criticized Portugal for allowing
rebel spokesmen to operate in Lisbon. The Lisbon government says it
will act to prevent subversive actions by the rebels but cannot
interfere with the free speech of their spokesmen.
   Fernandes' body was found in undergrowth beside a road about six
miles north of the resort town of Cascais, where he lived. Cascais
is about 20 miles west of Lisbon.
   Fernandes, 44, a Portuguese citizen born in Mozambique, was
secretary-general of RENAMO from 1983 to 1986. He was later demoted
to head of the guerrillas' research department, but he remained an
influential figure within the group.
   RENAMO's Lisbon spokesman Manuel Frank said today that Fernandes
had gone to Mozambique in January and met rebel chief Afonso
Dhlakama. Dhlakama condemned the killing and praised Fernandes as a
``fighter for freedom'' in a statement distributed in Lisbon.
   Fernandes' predecessor as RENAMO secretary-general, Orlando
Cristina, was shot to death in his bed in April 1983 in Pretoria,
South Africa. Some reports blamed the murder on a rebel power
struggle, but RENAMO blamed Mozambican security agents.
   Fernandes was married twice and had six children.

   Rebels seized dozens of villagers in
Gaza Province and then massacred 54 of them with axes, clubs and
machetes near the southern coastal town of Xai-Xai, the official
news agency AIM said Wednesday.
   AIM said 13 women and eight children were among those
slaughtered on Monday night by guerrillas of the Mozambique
National Resistance and that 17 people were wounded, 15 of them
seriously.
   The agency, citing a report in Maputo's Noticias newspaper, said
most of the victims were kidnapped and forcibly marched to the
Fidel Castro village, just outside Xai-Xai and about 90 miles
northeast of Maputo, the capital.
   Mozambique's civil war has gone on for 12 years. It has resulted
in an estimated 600,000 deaths, created more than a million
refugees and left nearly half of the nation's 14.7 million people
dependent on food aid.
   No government acknowledges supporting the insurrectionists.
   The attack came while rebel leaders and government
representatives were in Kenya trying to resolve the war. Mozambican
churchmen, acting on behalf of the government, met the rebels
Tuesday, but no major breakthroughs were reported.
   The guerrillas have been accused of widespread civilian
atrocities in their battle to undermine Mozambique's socialist
government.
   South Africa openly supported the rebels until 1984, but says it
since has abided by a mutual non-aggression pact with neighboring
Mozambique.
   President Joaquim Chissano said recently he accepted South
African statements that it no longer aids the rebels. Mozambique
still believes the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups
in South Africa, however.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Renamo drops Mozambique election boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique's first multi-party elections were back on course last night
after Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the country's former rebel movement,
reversed his eve of poll decision to stage a boycott.
The Renamo leader changed his mind under intense pressure from the United
Nations, western countries that have helped fund the elections, and from
neighbouring states, including South Africa.
It would have been made clear to him that he could expect no sympathy from
either regional or international governments, and Mr Dhlakama may well have
been warned that the frontline group of southern African states were
prepared to offer military assistance to the newly elected government of
Mozambique should Renamo resume its guerrilla war.
'The fact that Zimbabwe had committed troops (to Mozambique) in the past was
a strong incentive to Dhlakama to sit up and take notice,' said Mr Greg
Mills, director of studies at the South African Institute for International
Affairs.
He said the sending by South Africa of Deputy President Thabo Mbkei and
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, with the blessing of other regional
states, to pressure Mr Dhlakama had shown the Renamo leader the depth of
anger at the boycott, which had threatened to unhinge years of work to
restore peace in the impoverished country.
The boycott decision, said Mr Mills, announced only hours before polling
began on Thursday, highlighted a deep split within Renamo, which fought a
16-year war against Mozambique's formerly Marxist rulers of President
Joaquim Chissano's Frelimo party.
'There is a very big split within the (Renamo) party, with Dhlakama and his
advisers on the one side and a large number of party officials who realised
Renamo had very little option,' said Mr Mills.
Mr Dhlakama changed his mind after negotiating through the night and morning
with officials from the United Nations, western embassies and the National
Election Commission. He declined to answer questions about his volte face.
The Commission extended the country's two-day presidential and parliamentary
elections and voting will continue today. Mozambicans and African leaders
had feared the Renamo boycott could lead to a renewal of the civil war which
ended with a peace accord between Renamo and Frelimo two years ago.
'A shadow has been lifted with Dhlakama's decision,' the United Nations
special envoy to Mozambique, Mr Aldo Ajello, said.
Mr Ajello, in charge of the 7,000 strong UN peacekeeping force, said his
impression was that the election had gone well so far.
President Chissano, widely expected to be returned to the presidency and
capture a majorty of the 250 parliamentary seats at stake, welcomed the
decision: 'This is what all of us wanted,' he said.
There remain doubts, however, about the Renamo leader's intentions, and many
observers do not rule out the possibility that Mr Dhlakama will cry foul
when the reults are declared.
Final results are not expected until mid-November. Mr There are 12
presidential contenders and 14 political groups vying for a place in the
assembly.

   Last year, southern Africa was
ablaze with wars in Angola, Mozambique and Namibia that all seemed
to defy a solution. Today, Namibia is on the road to independence,
Angola has a cease-fire, and there are moves afoot to begin peace
talks in Mozambique.
   Each conflict has been fueled by separate forces, but a common
ingredient for the improved regional climate has been South Africa's
campaign to mend relations with its long-hostile neighbors in black
Africa.
   Since August, South Africa has:
   _Withdrawn its troops from Angola, where they fought
intermittently since 1975 alongside the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The rebels and the
Marxist Angolan government reached a cease-fire agreement last week
that took effect Saturday.
   _Begun implementing a U.N.-supervised independence plan in
Namibia, the territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.
   _Held a series of top-level meetings with Mozambique and offered
financial assistance to help repair the country's war-devastated
economy.
   Black-ruled nations remain skeptical of South Africa, saying the
country's policy of apartheid at home and its destabilization
campaign abroad caused the regional turmoil.
   But there has been a sharp reversal in the political tides since
the middle of 1988, when conflicts dating to the 1960s and 1970s
appeared ready to escalate again.
   ``Those who were part of the problem yesterday are now part of
the solution,'' Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said Friday
night after returning from an African summit in Zaire, where the
Angolan cease-fire was announced.
   ``To make myself clear, I don't think the South Africans will go
back on their word'' in Angola or Namibia, Chissano was quoted as
saying by the national news agency AIM.
   In May 1988, the heaviest fighting in the Angolan war was
reported around the southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale. Angolan
government troops, backed by Cuban soldiers, fought the combined
UNITA-South African forces to an apparent standoff.
   The Cuban troop strength in Angola had surpassed 50,000 and South
Africa acknowledged 3,000 soldiers more-or-less based in Angola.
   Faced with an expensive, open-ended conflict and mounting white
casualties, South Africa apparently decided to leave Angola. Peace
talks between South Africa, Angola and Cuba _ but not UNITA _ began
in late May 1988.
   South Africa completed its withdrawal from Angola in August. In
December, the three countries signed a regional peace accord that
called for South Africa to halt aid to UNITA and to grant
independence to Namibia. In return, Cuba has agreed to a phased
troop withdrawal.
   UNITA, meanwhile, continued to fight for a power-sharing
agreement until the cease-fire was announced. Zambia's President
Kenneth Kaunda called the agreement ``a great moment for Africa.''
   The rival Angolan parties still face difficult negotiations, but
a commission elected at the summit plans to oversee the integration
of UNITA into the current one-party state.
   In Namibia, a 23-year bush war waged by the South-West Africa
People's Organization, or SWAPO, against South African rule appears
over.
   An estimated 10,000 SWAPO supporters celebrated the accord on
Saturday with a rally, and SWAPO leaders said that ``we must now
wage peace.''
   South Africa announced Saturday it was down to 1,500 troops in
Namibia, a week ahead of the U.N. deadline under the territory's
independence plan. South Africa had an estimated 50,000 soliders in
Namibia before the independence plan took effect April 1.
   The independence plan almost fell apart the day it began when
more than 1,000 SWAPO guerrillas crossed into northern Namibia in
violation of the regional peace agreement.
   More than 300 guerrillas and 27 security-force members were
killed, but the fighting has stopped and pre-independence elections
are planned for November. Independence is expected to come early
next year.
   Zambia's Kaunda, one of South Africa's harshest critics in the
past, said black African states would consider strengthening ties
with South Africa if Namibian independence goes smoothly.
   With tangible successes in Angola and Namibia, southern African
leaders have turned their sights toward the region's most active
conflict, Mozambique, where the Marxist government has fought the
rebel Mozambique National Resistance since 1977.
   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, whose troops support
Mozambican government forces, said the plan to end the Angolan war
could have parallels for Mozambique.
   Although the two wars differ in some ways, ``the (Angolan peace
talk) principles deserve the attention of the Mozambicans,'' he was
quoted as saying Friday by Zimbabwe's ZIANA news agency. ``I am sure
something will unfold soon.''
   Mozambique's Chissano said he hoped the Angolan agreement would
encourage the rebels to take up an amnesty offer in effect since
January 1988.
   More than 3,000 rebels, out of a force estimated at 12,000 to
22,000, already have accepted the offer, according to government
figures.
   On Saturday, Chissano said President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire
had agreed to act as a mediator between the government and the
guerrillas, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
   Chissano has refused to negotiate with the rebels, but his
government has quietly encouraged unpublicized talks between local
church leaders and the rebels, according to sources in Mozambique.

   The United States would be willing to consider
a mediation role to help end Mozambique's civil war but is seeking
clarifications regarding South Africa's proposed peace plan, U.S.
officials said Wednesday.
   The comments by U.S. officials responded to a call Tuesday by
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha for the United States to
mediate an end to the 12-year civil war in Mozambique.
   ``We welcome South Africa's expression of interest in ending the
tragic conflict in Mozambique that has brought endless suffering and
death to hundreds of thousands of Mozambiquan citizens,'' said State
Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   ``We encourage the government and people of Mozambique to achieve
a durable peace in their country. If that government were to ask us
to play a role in this regard, we would be prepared to give
thoughtful consideration to exactly how we could be of assistance,
either as mediator or otherwise,'' Redman said.
   But the United States is uncertain whether Botha's proposal
includes the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, known as RENAMO,
said another official.
   ``We are seeking clarification on that,'' said E. Gibson Lanpher,
the department's top official for southern Africa. Lanpher also said
``it's an open question whether the South African government has
made that decision'' of stopping aid to RENAMO.
   South Africa helped RENAMO in the early 1980s but says it stopped
such aid in 1984 under terms of an agreement with the government.
However, the Mozambique government continues to accuse South Africa
of aiding RENAMO.
   ``It is clear that South Africa's longstanding relations with
RENAMO give it the ability to play a constructive role in ending the
conflict if it's prepared to do so,'' Redman said.
   In testimony Wednesday to the House Appropriations Committee's
subcommittee on foreign operations, a refugee organization that
operates in the region said it was skeptical of South Africa's
claims that its support for RENAMO had ceased.
   William Frelick of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private
group, said RENAMO ``is the Khmer Rouge of Africa, and Mozambique is
its killing field.''
   RENAMO engages in ``systematic visciousness that puts it in a
class by itself,'' including mutilations of babies, forced labor of
the elderly, looting, torture and the killing of more than 100,000
people, he said.
   A State Department human rights report issued this week agrees
with this assessment, but disagrees with human rights groups'
suggestions that the RENAMO brutality has increased.
