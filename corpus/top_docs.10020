  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- There will be more 
exchanges between the capital markets of China and the United 
States, with the Shanghai-based Petrochemical Shareholding 
Company Ltd entering the U.S. capital market in the form of 
American Depositary Receipts (ADR). 
  U.S. investment in China will benefit both sides, J. Carter 
Beese, director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said here yesterday at a symposium on how to enter the capital 
market of the United States. 
  The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government and the Bank of New York. 
  Carter Beese said that he was happy about China's plan to 
issue one billion U.S. dollars-worth of global bonds in the 
United States. It will be the first time for China to enter the 
capital market of the United States. 
  Shanghai Vice-Mayor Wu Kuangdi agreed to Carter Beese's 
view. 
  Now three Shanghai-based companies have entered the capital 
market of the United States in the ADR form. Xu thought that 
they would help establish a good image for Chinese enterprises 
in the United States. 
  Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, 
estimated that the trading volume of ADR in the United States 
will grow from 20 billion U.S. dollars last year to some 25 
billion U.S. dollars this year, which will probably involve new 
enterprises from China. 
  Joseph M. Velli, vice-president of the Bank of New York, 
also 
lectured at the symposium, telling some 200 Chinese stock 
exchange officials how to enter the capital market of the United 
States in the form of ADR.

  [Text] [Announcer] A meeting between Ukraine's President 
Leonid Kravchuk and former U.S. President Richard Nixon is to 
take place soon. What does Leonid Kravchuk himself expect from 
this meeting? Volodymyr Tatarenko asked him to answer this 
question: 
  [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] The principal goal of the 
meeting is to involve private capital in Ukraine. We are 
setting such a goal while discussing this issue in the United 
States because we know that, and it seems to me that I had 
already said this at the news conference: No matter what credits 
are granted to us, unless private capital is invested in 
Ukraine, because it makes the bulk of the capital...[pauses] By 
the way, do you know how much the United States invests in 
foreign countries annually? Four hundred and fifty billion 
dollars. Can you imagine this? Half a trillion dollars are 
invested. But it is not the state that invests, but private 
firms. These are the Morgan, General Motors, Pepsi Cola, 
Johnson and Johnson, and so on and so forth. They have capital 
and they invest it. So, to involve them we here have to act 
relevantly adequately. That is to say, conditions, protection 
of [investments], and a market itself must be created. However, 
there should be promotion. 
  Therefore, the main goal of my meeting with vice president 
[title as heard] Mr. Nixon is to agree on how to involve private 
capital in Ukraine. This is the main thing. And to exchange 
opinions on the political situation. He has relevant 
instructions from relevant circles in the United States and he 
wants to draw his own conclusions proceeding from his own 
observations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And what if he meets the 
opposition leaders? 
  [Kravchuk] He is welcome to do this. I will not object to 
this. I will even propose this to him. Let him listen to the 
opposition leaders. I would only want him to ask them to show 
him their programs. Not just words, but programs. Because, 
there are quite a few amateurs whose hobby is to talk a lot. If 
he considers their programs and they are better and more 
effective, believe me, we will glorify our dear opposition. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A seminar opened 
here today to discuss the access of Chinese enterprises to the 
capital market of the United States. 
  Some 150 Chinese and American securities experts, 
accountants 
and lawyers attended the one-day seminar, which was jointly 
sponsored by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the 
Bank of New York of the United States. 
  Fu Fengxiang, vice-chairman of the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission, said at the seminar that China's 
securities market has experienced fast development since the 
country started reform and opening 15 years ago. 
  He said that a good environment for securities business in 
China has taken shape. 
  Fu told the participants that China adopted nearly 20 laws 
and regulations concerning securities last year. And it is 
going to promulgate a securities law in the near future to 
provide better legal protection for the management of securities. 
  He noted that Sino-foreign cooperation in the economic field 
has expanded from joint ventures to capital investment. 
  China recently issued depository receipts in the United 
States which have shown positive results, Fu said. 
  Fu expressed his belief that the seminar will effectively 
encourage Chinese enterprises and their securities to enter the 
world market, especially the U.S. capital market. 
  Joseph M. Velli, executive vice-president of the Bank of New 
York, briefed the participants on the U.S. capital market, 
saying that according to an estimation of his bank, China will 
become the most important new depository receipts-issuing 
country. 
  He added that many international companies and individual 
buyers are "very interested" in China's stocks issued in the 
United States. 
  J. Carter Beese, commissioner of the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New 
York Stock Exchange, and Thomas D. Sanford, vice-president of 
the Bank of New York, answered questions raised by participants.

 [Editorial: "Fallen Walls"] 
  [Text] Another taboo of the modern world has collapsed with 
the end of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on 
Vietnam. After 19 years the embargo was maintained mainly for 
historical reasons. 
  Little remains of the differences that led the two countries 
to war in the 1960's and 1970's. Vietnam has withdrawn its 
troops from Cambodia. With a single party system, and without 
worrying about subjects like human rights, Vietnam has gradually 
opened its market to the rest of the world. 
  The truth is that Vietnam allowed itself to be contaminated 
by the winds of trade and prosperity that turned the Far East 
into the greatest laboratory of economic experiences at the turn 
of the century. To a certain extent the embargo created more 
distress for American companies than for the Vietnamese 
themselves. 
  In a country where everything literally had to be 
constructed 
or reconstructed, capital from Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South 
Korea, and from the former colonial world power, France, among 
other European investors, poured in. 
  Melting the ice with the United States was more difficult, 
but it began in the mid-1980's when the Americans were still 
grieving over the humiliation of the military defeat. 
Curiously, there were not as many difficulties on the 
Vietnamese side. The economic reforms thus gained momentum in 
1986. Given the events in the USSR, the failure of Communism 
contrasted with the bewildering acceleration of the market 
economies in the neighboring countries. 
  U.S. goodwill, which Vietnam needed to gain access to 
international capital, was generated through a cooperative 
attitude over a subject that touched the heart of the Americans: 
The location of the prisoners of war whose whereabouts were 
unknown. Last year President Clinton withdrew the veto the 
United States imposed on help from international financial 
institutions. From then on, the embargo was psychological and 
political rather than economic. 
  We wonder when and how the same thing will happen with Cuba. 
The main objective of that embargo was to combat Communist 
infiltration in the continent and in the direct area of 
influence of the United States. 
  That motive no longer exists. The Cuban Government is in 
tatters and whenever they can, Cubans move from a government job 
to small private businesses. 
  Paradoxically the embargo is the only way Fidel Castro can 
still touch the nationalist feelings of the increasingly 
disillusioned Cubans. It is his last chance to carry the Cuban 
flag. 
  If the embargo were lifted it would be doubtful if the Cuban 
regime would survive the avalanche of opportunities that would 
be created by the arrival of capitalist agents, that is, 
development.

BRADY CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON LATE IMF LOANS 




From Associated Press 




WASHINGTON 




Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today the United States will support 
increasing the resources of the International Monetary Fund only if it agrees 
to crack down on poor countries behind in their loan payments. 


Brady's comments, to IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, came one day after 
finance leaders of the world's seven largest industrial powers endorsed a 50% 
boost in the fund's resources to $180 billion from the current $120 billion. 


Brady acknowledged that the 152-nation lending organization needs more money to 
meet new demand for its loans from Eastern European countries moving from 
communism to capitalism, as well as for developing nations. Although the United 
States had supported a smaller boost, he said it has agreed to 50% as a 
compromise. 


"We firmly believe that the IMF must have adequate resources . . . to continue 
to fulfill its critical responsibilities in the world economy," he said. 


However, he said the United States will support an increase in capital 
contributions from member nations, called quotas, only if the fund adopts a new 
strategy to wring $4 billion in back payments from 11 countries -- Sudan, 
Zambia, Peru, Honduras, Guyana, Cambodia, Vietnam, Liberia, Panama, Sierra 
Leone and Somalia. 


"These arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the IMF's financial integrity 
and its central role in the world economy," Brady said. 


The Group of Seven -- finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the United 
States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy -- met 
Sunday in an ornate caucus room in the Capitol.

 ["Outcries Over `Threat From Japan' in the U.S." -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today says the U.S.-Japan relations in the past 
were relations of senior-junior alliance in which Japan was 
thoroughly subordinated to the United States but, now, Americans 
are raising a hue and cry over "threat from Japan" as Japan's 
ambition to overshadow the United States has surfaced following 
the end of the Cold War. 
  Noting that some Americans are of the opinion that Japan 
might be the only country which can say "no" to the United 
States in the post-Cold War period, the article says: 
  Japan at last began to say "no" to the United States. The 
Japanese prime minister said "no" when discussing trade friction 
and other issues with the U.S. President during his visit to the 
United States last year, thus breaking down the talks. 
  The United States is very nervous about such developments. 
It is alerted against the stark fact that Japan may become its 
archrival in the future in executing its global strategy. For 
their conflicting interests the United States is trying to hold 
down Japan. But Japan has built up "defences" and is stubbornly 
resisting it. 
  Noteworthy here is it that the United States is being driven 
into a position of passive defence. 
  After the Second World War Japan has surfaced as an economic 
power under the U.S. shadow. It has unfolded a challenging and 
ambitious economic strategy and began to regard the United 
States as nothing, in the belief that in the present-day world 
where the Cold War has come to an end the economic potential is 
the real strength and, accordingly, those who established 
economic supremacy would come at the helm of power for world 
domination. 
  In recent years the United States has annually suffered a 
deficit of more than 50 billion dollars in trade with Japan. 
Worse still, Japan is extensively buying land and businesses of 
the United States. Words are rife now in the U.S. public that 
should such development continue the Japanese capital would 
swallow up the whole territory of the United States some time in 
the future. The United States is raising terrific outcries over 
Japan's trade offensive, calling it the "second attack on Pearl 
Harbour". 
  Meanwhile, Japan, broadening new markets, is continually 
increasing investments to form its economic sphere. 
Subsequently, the United States is gradually going into the 
passive. 
  Japan is also trying by degrees to free itself from the U.S. 
control militarily. By legalizing the troop dispatch overseas 
of its "self-defence forces" and accelerating its own nuclear 
armament Japan is intending to take the initiative and act a 
political power in the international arena. 
  Now, Japan has made all material preparations for the 
production of nuclear weapons any moment. The United States is 
very uneasy about this. 
  Some quarters of Japan say they cannot forget the atomic 
bombing of the United States on the territory of Japan, and 
agitate people by saying Japan must call it "to account for" 
this in the future. 
  Judging from all this, one can see that what Japan seeks is 
to exhaust the United States in the economic, military and other 
domains and take the initiative in the international arena. 
  At present, the United States is trying to keep Japan under 
its control, and the latter is intending to get the upper hand 
by fostering its own strength without letup, while pretending to 
make concessions to the former and seemingly currying favor with 
it. 
  The relations between the United States and Japan, each 
having an axe to grind, will take a turn for the worse with the 
passage of time.

 ["Imperialism Near Its Doom" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The imperialists are 
bluffing, holding forth about the "end of socialism," but it is 
none other than imperialism that is approaching its doom, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. The article says: 
This is well illustrated by the serious crisis the 
imperialists now are undergoing. 
  Above all, socio-class antagonisms have grown worse in the 
imperialist countries because of the reactionary and corrupt 
nature of the capitalist system. 
  The capitalist political system is a political system and 
order which was framed up by a handful of the capitalist class 
to oppress and exploit the popular masses who account for an 
overwhelming majority of the population. Hence, the class 
antagonisms between the reactionary ruling class and the popular 
masses are increasing day by day. 
  In 1992 alone violent protests of dissatisfied workers 
against the reactionary policy of the government took place in 
the United States on 111,000 occasions. This graphically shows 
to what extent the socio-class antagonisms have gone in 
imperialist countries. 
  With the money-is-everything tendency fully reflected in 
politics, plutocracy is holding sway in capitalist society. In 
Japan, the cabinet had to resign and the Diet was dissolved 
before the expiry of its term repeatedly due to bribery cases 
involving political circles including the "Lockheed scandal". 
  Economic crisis is deteriorating in imperialist countries. 
  The annual federal financial deficits of the United States 
are more or less 300 billion dollars and the state debts far 
exceed 4,000 billion dollars. 
  The economy in Britain, Japan, Germany, France and other 
countries is also floundering like a ship in distress. Japan is 
now in the grip of worst depression since World War II, which 
gives a glimpse of the society of this country seized with 
uncontrollable uncertainty for the future. 
  The serious crisis of the imperialists is also manifested in 
all cases of corruption and social vices rife in these countries. 
  The United States called the "drug kingdom" has more than 30 
million addicts. 
  Violent criminal cases like murder and robbery are getting 
more uncontrollable in the imperialist countries. 
  The imperialists, with false propaganda about the "end of 
socialism," are trying to divert elsewhere the public attention 
from the serious crisis of destruction they are now undergoing, 
cause ideological vacillation among the revolutionary people of 
the world who aspire after independence, progress and socialism 
and to break their faith in socialism so as to stem the tide of 
history. But this is a foolish dream.

REVISED TAX LAW NEEDED TO PUT AMERICAN CAPITAL TO WORK IN THE ECONOMY 




By GEORGE MAROTTA, George Marotta is a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover 
Institution and a certified financial planner in Palo Alto. 




Everyone agrees that the United States is lagging badly in the competition for 
international markets. Temporarily, a declining dollar is keeping us in the 
game by making our products less expensive to foreigners. But a strong Japan 
and a soon-to-be economically unified Europe will continue to challenge our 
economic supremacy. 


What the Bush Administration adopts now as an economic game plan will be very 
important in determining whether America can remain competitive over the long 
term. 


A decrease in the capital-gains tax rate from the current maximum of 33% may 
well be the most important action we could take at this time. (Formerly, 
capital gains on properties held more than six months qualified for "long-term" 
treatment and a top capital gains tax rate of 20%.) President Bush has proposed 
a maximum rate of 15% on investments held for at least three years. 


Most economists agree that a lower capital-gains rate would increase U.S. 
savings, support the current economic expansion and increase America's 
international competitiveness. Although many will argue that such a reduction 
would favor the wealthy class, there are many reasons to support such a move: 


 -- The United States is disadvantaged in international competition because of 
the high cost of capital. Interest rates are high because our savings rate -- 
at about 4% of gross national product -- is one of the lowest, if not the 
lowest, among the major industrialized countries. High interest rates favor 
debt investment rather than stock ownership. The U.S. capital-gains tax rate is 
now the highest among our major competitors. This reduces our ability to 
innovate and compete. Japan, France, West Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea 
all exempt long-term capital gains from taxation. 


 -- A reduction in the capital-gains tax rate may actually increase tax 
revenues, according to recent academic and governmental studies. The rush to 
sell stocks at the end of 1986 in order to take advantage of the last days of 
the low 20% top rate proves that the size of the capital-gains tax base is 
highly sensitive to the tax rate. Conversely, as rates rise, individuals enter 
into fewer transactions. Thus, while more revenue is collected per dollar of 
"realized" gain, there are fewer gains realized, shrinking the tax base and 
revenues. A decrease in rates could help reduce the budget deficit. 


 -- Reducing the capital-gains tax rate is needed to create more jobs. From 
$25,000 to $50,000 of capital is needed to create one new job. Small businesses 
with fewer than 100 employees provide most of the new employment opportunities. 
Between 1978 and 1985, the number of small company start-ups more than doubled, 
rising from 270,000 to 640,000, creating 15 million new jobs. 


The formation of small businesses is very sensitive to the capital-gains tax 
rate. The number of offerings of stock in new firms has exploded every time 
there has been a reduction in the top capital-gains tax rate, as there was in 
1979 and in 1983. 


 -- Although the United States is the "leader" of the capitalistic free world, 
we are very unfriendly to capital. Capital gains are taxed also at the state 
level, increasing the overall rate well above the federal maximum of 33%. 
California and New York have the highest combined rates of 39.2% and 38.6%, 
respectively. 


Many states had budget surpluses in 1987, which were the result of heavy 
selling of common stock to take advantage of the low capital-gain tax rates 
expiring at the end of 1986. In contrast, state deficits in 1988 were the 
result of the higher rates that became effective at the beginning of that year. 


 -- Liberals will argue that lower capital-gains taxes favor the rich. However, 
such taxes are really on the creation of wealth. This tax is a voluntary one. 
It can be avoided by not selling an asset in which a gain exists. No 
transaction, no "realized" gain, no tax! Furthermore, an asset held until death 
will escape all capital-gains taxes, as they receive a "stepped-up basis" to 
the heirs. 


Actually, the 1986 capital-gains tax increase fell most disproportionately on 
the average investor. The average marginal tax rate on the capital gains faced 
by all but the highest taxpayers has more than doubled, rising to 23% from 
10.4%. 


 -- Much of the so-called "gains" on capital are really not gains at all, but 
simply inflation. For example, while the cost-of-living index has gone up about 
200% since 1970, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was about 1000 in 
1970, would have to go 3000 just to keep up with inflation. However, if you 
bought stock in 1970 and sold it now, the government would tax the gain from 
1000 to the present level 2286, a gain of 1286 -- even though there has been no 
gain in real purchasing power. 


Congress gave homeowners over 55 years old a one-time tax break on $125,000 of 
realized gain on the sale of their home to compensate for inflation gains. They 
need to apply the same treatment to common stocks, and to homeowners under 55. 
(Britain has no capital-gains tax on principal residences). 


It seems ironic that while the whole world, including China and even the Soviet 
Union, are discovering the benefits of the free markets and the advantages of 
the capitalistic system, the United States remains most unfriendly toward 
existing capital and the creation of needed new capital.

HANOI OKS EXODUS TO U.S. OF FREED POLITICAL PRISONERS 




From Associated Press 




BANGKOK, Thailand 




The United States and Vietnam on Sunday announced an agreement for former 
political prisoners and their relatives to be resettled in the United States, 
with the first group of 3,000 expected to leave this year. 


A joint statement, released in Bangkok, said the two sides hope to begin by 
October "a program for the resettlement in the United States of released 
re-education center detainees and their close family members who wish to 
emigrate to the United States." 


The Communists toppled the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April, 1975, 
and hundreds of thousands of people were put into the camps of manual labor and 
political re-education because of their ties to the old regime. 


The U.S. government has sought a formal program for their resettlement since 
1982, but political bickering barred progress. 


The agreement was reached in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, in talks last week 
between teams led by Vu Khoan, Vietnamese assistant foreign minister, and 
Robert L. Funseth, U.S. senior deputy assistant secretary of state. 


Funseth said the pact "starts healing the last big wound remaining from the 
war, which is that these people who were clearly associated with the United 
States have not been allowed to leave Vietnam and be united with their 
relatives. . . . "

 [Editorial: "The Year 1994 and Clinton's Dreams"] 
  [Text] The United States had a very difficult year in 1993, 
according to many. Most of the observers are unanimous on two 
points: 
  --The United States is planning for the future and the 
current uncoordinated policies are part of that planning. 
  --The Democrats as well as the people of the United States 
have made a mistake in electing Clinton as their President. 
  In any case, in 1993 the United States passed through a 
period in which it experienced problems inherited from the 
Republicans, including the events in Somalia and the ambivalence 
toward Russia. 
  However, in the Middle East the United States was successful 
in implementing a compromise more controversial and more 
treasonous than the Camp David accord. When 'Arafat--stripped 
of his gunbelt--shook hands with Rabin on the White House 
grounds, there were many who banged their heads against the wall 
in sheer fury. Some were not even Palestinians but had realized 
that the days of the Cold War had actually come to an end and 
most of the terms of that era had lost their true meaning. 
  In the early days of 1994, the U.S. President will have two 
very important meetings: with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in 
Geneva and with Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow. The Geneva 
meeting is of vital importance to the United States. If Hafiz 
al-Asad joins the trend of compromise, the Gaza-Jericho accord 
will be insured. In addition, if Israel makes peace with Syria, 
it will be able to enter the Middle East markets and the 
longstanding dream of the Zionists will materialize. 
  However, if Hafiz al-Asad insists on his former stance, the 
Gaza-Jericho accord will meet with the same fate as the Camp 
David accord. It will become the unsuccessful and isolated plan 
of an individual named 'Arafat who has neither legitimacy nor 
popularity. 
  Clinton will also have to empathize with Yeltsin and at the 
same time beware of someone such as Zhirinovskiy as the trend of 
events in Russia seems to be uncontrollable and unpredictable. 
The Russians need billions of dollars of assistance and the 
United States cannot hope to have such capital returned, 
especially since it does not know what to do about the vacuum 
created by the disbanding of the Warsaw pact in Eastern Europe. 
  Thus, it appears that the United States has difficult days 
ahead in 1994, especially since a united Europe is economically 
stronger than the United States. Even though it is not endowed 
with the U.S. political strength, it has very strong industries 
and considers rivalry in trade and commerce of greater 
importance than politics. The United States is aware that if it 
is hesitant in its approach toward countries such as the PRC and 
if it takes political considerations into account in its 
bilateral relations, Europe will immediately sign numerous 
agreements and will conquer the markets. 
  All these circumstances are not completely subservient to 
the 
wishes, needs, and capabilities of the Democrat administration 
in the United States, as Washington's cohorts and competitors 
have gauged the conditions prevailing in the world and have 
unconditionally demanded their rights. Therefore, Clinton will 
not be able to see all his dreams come true in 1994.

    Assistant Minister on U.S. Financial Talks 
  SK2901113094 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 29 Jan 94 p 17 
 SK2901113094 
  Seoul THE KOREA TIMES 



Language:  English 
Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Assistant Finance Minister Yim says Seoul wants the 
United States to unify dialogue channels on financial issues. 
He added that it is the United States that led to a stalemate 
in the Uruguay Round financial services negotiations. Yim said 
Washington threatened to take the exemption from the most 
favored nation (MFN) status, an act which is a violation of a 
universal principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. "The United States declared in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations that it will adopt a two-tier approach to deny MFN 
status to countries that Washington argues reject full national 
treatment and market access to U.S. financial services 
companies," Yim said. 
  If the United States had stuck to the MFN principle, the 
multilateral financial services agreement would have been 
reached in Geneva last December, Yim said. 
  In an apparent displeasure over the US trade 
representative's 
[USTR] comment on Korea and Japan as "free riders" in financial 
services, Yim said the purpose of the USTR is to open foreign 
markets. Kantor made a special reference to Korea and Japan as 
free riders out of attempt to maximize "announcement effect" in 
prodding these countries into opening further their financial 
markets. 
  He said it is regrettable for the USTR to complain over the 
Korean financial market while the U.S. Treasury Department does 
not make any comment. 
  Korea is one of a few countries where a large number of U.S. 
financial firms are operating. As the Korean and Japanese 
markets are attractive, the USTR seeks to open their financial 
markets wider, he said. 
  Yim said the USTR is not interested in African countries 
where few or no American firms are operating. 
  Why does the United States complain that Korea is unwilling 
to open its financial market at a time when the nation has been 
accelerating the implementation of the financial reform plan? 
Yim said it is because American firms can find "attractive 
business opportunities" here. 
  Yim acknowledged that Seoul has not accommodated part of the 
U.S. requests because some of its proposals are "out of tune 
with international practices." 
  For example, the United States wants American bank branches 
here to use head office capital as their branch capital. But 
even Germany and France do not accept this request. "As Korea 
has no power to inspect head offices of foreign banks here, it 
can not check the credit worthiness of each bank. Thus it is 
unreasonable for American banks to try to link their head office 
capital to Korean operations," he said. 
  Asked to comment on what action Seoul will take if 
Washington 
takes a retaliatory step against Korea, Yim said "it is the last 
thing we want". But "we do not want a situation where the 
United States retains the right to restrict operations of Korean 
firms in the United States while American financial firms are 
expanding business here." 
  In the Uruguay Round, "We made it clear that if any country 
restricts the overseas activities of Korean financial firms, we 
will take a similar reciprocal retaliatory action against the 
financial firms from the specific country, Yim said. [no end 
quotation mark as published] 
  If Washington seeks to take an exemption from the MFN 
standing to discriminate against specific countries, other GATT 
member countries will take similar actions, adding that the 
United States will face international criticism for violating 
the basic principle of the GATT, Yim said.

    Data on Foreign Investment in Slovenia

Language:  Slovene 
Article Type:CSO 

 [Article by Manka Kremensek: "How Much Foreign Capital Is in 
Slovenia?"] 
  [Excerpt] Ljubljana -- [passage omitted] Germany, Austria, 
and Italy are the main foreign investors in Slovene businesses, 
accounting for 65.9 percent of all foreign capital investments, 
or 81.6 percent of their value. Investors from other countries, 
such as the United States, are not too interested, as seen from 
the table below. 
  It is hard to obtain statistics on the origin offoreign 
capital, where it is invested, and the amounts. The Ministry of 
Foreign Relations and Development has collected such data. It 
must protect business interests, however, and does not want to 
release the information. 
  However, it is known that there is substantial foreign 
capital investment in some businesses, e.g., Austrian capital 
has a 51-percent share of Henkel-Zlatorog in Maribor; in the 
tobacco factory in Ljubljana, German capital has a 56-percent 
and French capital an 18-percent share; the paper manufacturer 
in Kolicevo is 94 percent capitalized by Italians; and Uniteh in 
Skofja Loka is 51 percent capitalized by Austrians. 
  Slovenia is in great need of foreign investors, and it is in 
the country's interest to attract as many as possible. Of 
course, at the same time it must protect its national interests. 
  The adopted strategy should strive to attract foreign 
investors while at the same time protecting areas that are of 
national importance. A passive policy toward foreign investment 
means that we miss the opportunity to direct foreign capital 
into those economic sectors which need it most right now.

 [From the "Last Minute" program presented by Joao Antunes] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] after Washington officially 
established diplomatic relations with Luanda, the (?relations) 
between the two capitals [words indistinct]. What is more, the 
expected opening of channels and [words indistinct] very far 
from corresponding to the true expectations of the Luanda 
authorities. This evening, we asked Angolan Ambassador in 
Washington Jose Patricio what is the Angolan Government's 
assessment of relations with Washington. Did it expect more or 
did it expect less? He gave the following reply. 
  [Begin recording] [Patricio] In general, we expected more 
both at a bilateral level and in the multilateral role played by 
the United States as a mediator and as a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council. All the same, we have to recognize that 
there has been some progress. It could not do more because of 
an impeding factor, the war. 
  [Antunes] You speak of an impeding factor. There is a 
feeling, however, that the Luanda authorities expected the 
United States to be more vigorous in condemning the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Is that 
true? 
  [Patricio] We always expected the United States to adopt a 
more vigorous stand with regard to UNITA's war-mongering stand. 
It seems, however, that the U.S. administration has been having 
difficulties in playing its rightful role in the field of 
mediation and its [words indistinct] normalization of relations 
at the bilateral level. All the same, recent developments show 
that there will be greater transparency in Washington's role 
both at bilateral and multilaterlal levels. I say this, basing 
myself in the last correspondence that President Bill Clinton 
had with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. President Clinton 
has abandoned the indecision of the past where the U.S. 
administration viewed the government as simply one of the 
parties in the conflict. 
  [Antunes] Mr. ambassador, (?there are reports) that 
Washington is expected to play a more active role in peace talks 
in Lusaka [words indistinct]? 
  [Patricio] Well, there is a link between all the capitals 
which play the mediating role, that is Washington, Lisbon, and 
Moscow. It is evident that Washington, being the capital of the 
world power, has a more important role than other mediators. 
Washington also has this responsibility because it was part of 
the conflict since UNITA was an instrument of the U.S. policy. 
We should not forget this factor. [end recording]

 ["Text" of Foreign Ministry communique -- place and date of 
issue not given] 
  [Text] On 20-21 May 1994, U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State Winston Lord on behalf of the U.S. Government and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai on behalf of the SRV Government 
exchanged letters of agreement on the establishment of liaison 
offices in the capitals of the two countries. 
  According to the agreement, the initial form of official 
representation of Vietnam in the United States and of the United 
States in Vietnam will be liaison offices, and the heads of 
these offices will be called head of the liaison office. The 
two offices will work within the framework of the 1963 Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations, to which both sides are 
signatories. 
  The opening of liaison offices in the capitals of the two 
countries marks an important developmental step on the path to 
the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United 
States, thus creating favorable conditions for the two 
governments to continue to resolve issues of common concern and 
meeting the interests of the two peoples and the interests of 
peace, stability, and development in the region.

  [Text] Salta, May 22 (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
Argentine ambassador to the United States, said that he supports 
the approval of a patents law, adding that "all countries, and 
not only Argentina, agree that it is advisable to recognize the 
intellectual rights of researchers." 
  Granillo said: "This is accepted even by the association 
organized to defend national laboratories. Besides, it is not an 
Argentine commitment with the United States alone, it is a 
commitment with the entire international community." 
  The ambassador recalled that Argentina "and another 106 
countries signed the GATT agreement," which "obligates" 
Argentina "to approve a law recognizing patent rights." 
  "The real problem will be if Argentina wants to join NAFTA, 
because the requirements here are much tougher and anyone 
wanting to join in must respect the local rules of the game," 
Granillo Ocampo said, during an interview with the daily EL 
TRIBUNO from this provincial capital. 
  Granillo Ocampo said Argentina "will try to balance what we 
and others must give up," adding that "we must not be afraid of 
this type of conflict, as on most other topics we are working in 
absolute harmony, together and in agreement." 
  The Argentine ambassador said "it was vital" for Argentina 
to 
join NAFTA "to consolidate the model," because "when a country 
coordinates its macroeconomic polices with other countries, the 
rules of the game are consolidated and stabilized." 
  Regarding Argentina's trade deficit with the United States, 
Granillo Ocampo said the situation was not dramatic, as the 
deficit is the result "of an important increase in imports in 
capital goods used in the incorporation of new technologies." 
  "Argentina let a lot of time go by without investing in 
technology. The deficit ended up producing a very large hole, 
which condemned the country to suffer a loss of competitiveness 
and trade deficits," Granillo Ocampo said. 
  The ambassador dismissed the possibility of creating a 
common 
front with Australia and the United States on agriculture 
subsidies, adding that "we are negotiating only because we must 
face a situation that hurts us all." 
  Regarding the purchase of planes equipped with radar, the 
ambassador said the country "got the planes it was looking for." 
  Asked about the possible sale of Pampa planes to the United 
States, Granillo Ocampo said: "Price conditions established in 
the offer will determine whether we can go ahead with the deal."
