FUTURE HURRICANES MAY PACK MORE PUNCH 




By JOY ASCHENBACH, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 




The names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of 
Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in 
the future. 


"The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater 
in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says 
meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes 
hurricane patterns. 


Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s 
and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought. 
Rainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricane 
activity, was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969, he says. A 
second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought. 


The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from 
tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa. The well-watered conditions 
in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) 
in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967. 


Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No. 5, or 
catastrophic storm. The atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically 
and its wind speed exceeds 155 m.p.h. 


In the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms. 
In the '88 and '89 seasons -- June through November -- there have been five. 


Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and 
the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western 
Hemisphere. Its atmospheric pressure dropped to 885 millibars and its wind 
speed reached 200 m.p.h. 


This September's Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico 
before clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an 
atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches). Officially a 4 on the 
Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark 
Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 


The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the 
western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars. Outside the Atlantic 
area and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. 


Fortunately, most Atlantic-region hurricanes do not develop to their worst 
potential. In this century, only two No. 5 hurricanes have struck the United 
States with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys 
and 1969's Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana. In 1980, 
Allen, the mightiest Caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch 
before it hit the Gulf Coast of Texas. 


"If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, 
there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms," Gray said. 


But in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five 
times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population 
and property development along coastal areas. 


The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any 
yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. 


Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea. 
They get their power from the water's warmth. To develop, they need tropical 
ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 


"If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," 
Emanuel explains. "Sea-surface temperatures set the upper limits." 


The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect 
tropical ocean temperatures. 


The gradual warming of the Earth results from the greenhouse effect, caused 
primarily by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, 
which, like the glass of a greenhouse, trap heat.

GLOBAL WARMING STORM LINK PROBED; 


PREDICTED RISE IN OCEAN TEMPERATURES MAY INCREASE WINDS 




By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 




Hurricane Hugo is a harbinger of the type of high-intensity storms that can be 
expected more often in the future due to the greenhouse effect and the 
resulting global warming, researchers said Tuesday. 


Warming ocean and air temperatures will feed extra energy into the hurricanes, 
increasing their wind speeds by 20% to 25% and their maximum intensity by as 
much as 60%, according to computer models. 


"We can say with some confidence that the frequency of Category 4 and Category 
5 hurricanes (the most severe) will increase, but we can't say by how much," 
said meteorologist Richard Anthes, head of the university consortium that 
operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 




Gilbert Sets Record 


In fact, the most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean, 
Hurricane Gilbert with wind speeds of more than 200 m.p.h., occurred last 
September. But neither Gilbert nor Hugo can be definitely linked to global 
warming, researchers noted. "It's impossible to link one event to climatic 
change," Anthes said. 


Researchers are generally cautious in their predictions about the effects of 
global warming. 


"It's difficult to take something as complex as a hurricane and attribute 
changes to a single cause like warmer temperatures, simply because the 
atmosphere is such a complex mixture and there are so many physical processes 
going on," said Ohio State University atmospheric scientist Jay Hobgood, one of 
the researchers whose models are the basis for projections of hurricane 
strengths. 


"There's an awful lot of uncertainty and an awful lot that is not understood," 
added meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
another modeler. "But if ocean temperature goes up, the intensity of extreme 
hurricanes will go up." 




'Seat-of-the-Pants Feeling' 


And, said meteorologist Rainer Bleck of the University of Miami, there is a 
growing consensus among researchers that this is what will happen. But "that 
conclusion is not based on scientific results yet," he added. "It is more of a 
seat-of-the-pants feeling." 


The link to global warming occurs because heat is the engine that drives 
hurricanes. Strong sunlight heats both air and water near the Equator, causing 
a greater evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The warm, moist air expands 
and rises, creating a ring of low pressure and storms around the Equator known 
as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. 


As the moist air rises, it cools, causing its moisture to condense into clouds. 
But that condensation releases a tremendous amount of heat stored in the 
gaseous water, accelerating the heating and rising of the air. 




Starts With 'Kicker' 


Although scientists do not yet know under precisely what conditions hurricanes 
form, this condensation and heat release is the "kicker" that starts vast 
amounts of air climbing upward, drawing in ever-larger quantities of moist air 
from the ocean surface, Bleck said. 


Eventually, the Earth's rotation causes the fast-moving air masses to spin in a 
counterclockwise motion in the Northern Hemisphere or clockwise in the 
Southern. 


Hurricanes typically take five to six days to form, eventually spreading over 
an area of thousands of square miles and developing wind speeds that range from 
75 m.p.h. (the official minimum for a hurricane) to more than 200 m.p.h. The 
storms continue as long as they can draw warm moist air from the ocean. 
Hurricanes peter out when they pass over cold water or land. 




Gases Trap Heat 


Climatologists predict that global warming -- caused by the accumulation of 
carbon dioxide and certain other gases in the atmosphere, which trap the 
Earth's heat like the panes of a greenhouse -- will cause both ocean and air 
temperatures to increase, perhaps eventually by as much as 10 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 


A warmer ocean causes more water to evaporate, and warmer air can hold more 
water vapor. Both factors would increase the strength of hurricanes. 


"That's what you see in reality," Hobgood said. "If you have warmer air, warmer 
water, you do get a more intense storm." 




'Need More Research' 


The problem, he added, is that warming will not occur to the same extent 
everywhere, and other conditions caused by global warming, such as stronger 
winds at high altitudes, might mitigate some of the effects of heating. "We 
need to do a lot more research," he said. 


The researchers did have one piece of good news. Hurricane Hugo will probably 
sap the strength of tropical depression Iris, which is following close behind 
it. It will probably also push Iris northward into the Atlantic, keeping it 
from striking the United States or islands in the Caribbean.

HURRICANE EXPECTED TO MISS HAWAII 




From Times wire services 




HONOLULU 




Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii today on a course that would take it 
150 miles south of the state's southernmost island, meteorologists said. 


"Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little from it, but not 
much," said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here. "But 
then you can't be too optimistic." 


At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was 830 miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, 
southernmost in the chain, moving west-northwest at 20 m.p.h., Manning said. 
Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 m.p.h.. A storm is classified a 
hurricane when that speed reaches 74 m.p.h. 


At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass south of Hawaii 
Island, the "Big Island," on Tuesday night.

HURRICANE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL STORM 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




Hurricane Nana lost its punch, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center 
in Miami expected it to slowly continue losing strength as it remained nearly 
stationary in the Caribbean. Nana, which is now designated as a tropical storm, 
had top winds of 70 m.p.h., but it still posed a threat to Bermuda. Nana, the 
eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, moved north-northeast at 
nearly 5 m.p.h. and was expected to turn toward the northeast today.

STORM LOSES HURRICANE STATUS; MORE FLOODING IN EAST 




By from United Press International 




Tropical Storm Lili veered away from the mid-Atlantic coast Saturday, its 
hurricane status a memory, but the remnants of two other storms created 
floodwaters from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania before disintegrating. 


The National Weather Service reported that Lili, which had once carried 92 
m.p.h. wind gusts, dropped to tropical storm status Saturday as it began 
turning toward the north. 


A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the extreme southern coast of 
Virginia, with a tropical storm watch over the remainder of the Virginia coast. 
A tropical storm watch, with a coastal flood watch and heavy surf advisory, 
also was posted for the Delaware and Maryland coasts. 


As of Saturday afternoon, the storm was about 175 miles east of Cape Hatteras, 
N. C., and was moving north at about 14 m.p.h. Its peak winds of 65 m.p.h. 
extended up to 115 miles eastward, but it was expected to turn northeast and 
pick up speed as peak winds diminished. 


Weather officials said small craft from Hatteras to Eastport, Me., should 
remain in port. 


The strong winds combined with glass-smooth waters to produce ideal conditions 
for windsurfers who flocked to Pamlico Sound, which lies between North 
Carolina's Outer Banks and the mainland. 


Rain from two tropical storms that weakened and fell apart after hitting land 
caused some problems Saturday along the East Coast, where nine people were 
killed earlier in the week. 


A major flood was working its way down the Ogeechee River in east-central 
Georgia, the weather service reported. The level of the upper Ogeechee River 
was six feet above flood stage, the highest level since the 1940s. 


Heavy rains caused flooding over portions of northwest Virginia, western 
Maryland and eastern West Virginia. Many rivers and streams were overflowing 
their banks, and numerous roads were closed. 


A small-stream flood watch remained over northeast Pennsylvania, and flood 
watches also were posted over portions of New York state and northern Vermont. 


The remains of Tropical Storm Marco -- which earlier absorbed remnants of 
Tropical Storm Klaus -- were moving northward through the Carolinas, but the 
weather service said it had broken into a multitude of minor storms and was no 
longer trackable. 


In the Carolinas, six deaths were attributed to the storms. Two were traffic 
fatalities and four were the result of a collapsed dam, officials said. Georgia 
authorities reported three deaths from flooding near Augusta. 


Elsewhere Saturday, it was windy in the West with winds gusting to 57 m.p.h. 
near Pocatello, Ida., and 58 m.p.h. at Laramie, Wyo. 


Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, and the town of Spruce Lodge 
reported two inches of new snow. 


It was 84 degrees in Cape Hatteras, breaking the record high of 83 degrees set 
in 1986. It was the seventh record high tied or broken during the past week.

advantage of the winds. Associated Press

suitable load tests (see subpart E of part 3280). The revised standards also 

require that the ground anchoring and foundation support systems continue to 

be designed by a registered engineer or architect in a manner adequate to 

withstand the higher wind forces specified. 





III. Section-by-Section Analysis 





The Secretary has determined that the following changes should be made 

to the standards: 

(1) 



Section 3280.4



_The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is 

added to the list of organizations issuing standards that are incorporated by 

reference. The street addresses are corrected for two other organizations 

listed. 

(2) 



Section 3280.5



_Technical and conforming corrections are made to 

standardize paragraph designations to 



Federal Register



 format and clarify the 

information to be included on data plates. The new requirements also 

incorporate changes to the data plate adopted in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975, 

55003) for effect in October 1994, in order to avoid having inconsistent 

requirements become effective within a short time. 

The data plate is also being expanded to indicate that manufactured 

homes should not be located within 1500

&rsquo; of the coastline in Wind Zones II and 

III unless the home and its anchoring or foundation system are designed for 

the increased requirements of Exposure D in ASCE 7&hyph;88. The data plate will 

now also indicate whether the home has been equipped with storm shutters and, 

if shutters are not provided, will strongly recommend that the home be made 

ready for these devices in accordance with the method described in the 

installation instructions. 

(3) 



Sections 3280.302(a)(8), 3280.303(d), 3280.305(c)



_The definition 

and references to ``hurricane resistive design'' in these sections are deleted, 

in favor of the Wind Zone II and III designations in the revised Basic Wind 

Zone Map. These changes will result in the identification of design wind 

forces and wind speeds for which the home has been designed, rather than the 

designation of homes as ``hurricane resistive.'' 

(4) 



Section 3280.304



_The incorporated standards are amended to 

require that the minimum design loads be based on ASCE 7&hyph;88, which replaces 

the obsolete ANSI A58.1&hyph;1982 standard currently referenced in this section. 

In addition, the National Design Specification for Wood Members (NDS), 

incorporated by reference, is updated to the most current specification issued 

by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). Because manufacturers 

will need to redesign the structure's resistance to wind forces, the redesign 

should be accomplished with the most current design values for wood. 

Accordingly, the 1991 NDS is incorporated in its entirety into the standards. 

(5) 



Section 3280.305(c)



_The standards are amended to require that for 

manufactured homes in high wind areas, the home and each wind resisting part, 

including components and cladding, be completely designed to resist the design 

wind pressures specified for a 50-year recurrence level by ASCE 7&hyph;88 or the 

pressures specified in a table of equivalent design wind load provisions. The 

Department has designated three wind zones: Zone I (current wind design 

requirements for Zone I); Zone II (design wind speed of 100 mph); and Zone III 

(design wind speed of 110 mph). 

The Table of Design Pressures in the proposed rule is clarified and 

expanded. Editorial revisions to clarify the application of the uplift 

pressure requirements for exterior roof coverings, eaves and gables. In 

addition, footnotes are included to indicate: 

&bull;Distributional pressure effects between windward and leeward walls; 

&bull;The application of the Table is limited to roof slopes between 10 and 

30 degrees and that horizontal drag pressures need not be considered for roof 

slopes under 20 degrees; 

&bull;The design uplift pressures are the same regardless of whether they 

are applied normal to the roof surface or to the horizontal projection of the 

roof; and 

&bull;Exterior roof and wall coverings (excluding glazing), sheathing, and 

fastenings need not be evaluated for the design pressures specified by the 

Table, when fastened to a 3/8

&rsquo;

&rsquo; structural rated sheathing and the sheathing is 

oriented and secured to framing members in accordance with the fastening 

schedule specified in the Table. 

The Basic Wind Zone Map is revised by delineating the boundary between 

Wind Zones I and II as the 90 mph isotach, and the boundary between Wind Zones 

II and III as the 100 mph isotach, on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map. 

This change will result in certain areas of existing Wind Zone II being 

located in the modified Wind Zone I. The boundary between Wind Zones I and 

III in Alaska is now designated as the 90 mph isotach on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 map.

There are not enough DAPIA personnel in the HUD system to 

review and approve design changes within the time provided for the 

effectiveness of this rule (83, 124, 136, 179). 





Response: 



The Department has agreed to delay the effectiveness of the 

new requirements for 180 days, which should allow sufficient time for the 

DAPIA process, as well. 





Comment: 



The Department should consider requiring the DAPIA approval 

stamp on all pages of a manufacturer's installation instructions (48). 





Response: 



The final rule continues to require that the manufacturer 

provide installation instructions certified by a registered professional 

engineer indicating at least one acceptable system of anchoring (24 CFR 

3280.306(b)). However, the Department will consider the suggestion to require 

a DAPIA approval stamp on each page of the manufacturers' installation 

instructions when developing future revisions to the Manufactured Home 

Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282). 





Comment: 



Some explanation is needed about the effect of the new 

standards on ``B'' letters, interpretative bulletins, and compliance 

determinations (122). 





Response: 



This new standard supersedes any portions of ``B'' letters, 

interpretative bulletins, and compliance determinations that are in conflict 

with this standard. 





Comment: 



If the higher standards are adopted, manufacturers will prefer 

to build modular homes that meet the necessary State standards. 





Response: 



Manufacturers are free to channel their activities in any way 

that best responds to market forces. In the development of the regulatory 

impact analysis, the Department has accounted for the cost of potential lost 

business. To the extent that manufacturers could redirect their production to 

alternative housing, the costs of the higher standards would be lessened. 

However, as noted above, the Department believes that the trend in State 

standards also will be to stricter wind standards. Therefore, while 

manufactured homes may experience a price increase because of these standards, 

they will be affordable relative to site-built homes meeting the higher State-imposed standards. 





Comment: 



The Department should prepare a brochure on hurricane 

awareness and windstorm protection. 





Response: 



As noted in the discussion on Improved Anchoring and 

Foundation Systems earlier in the preamble, the Department is reviewing what 

would be an appropriate consumer information disclosure requirement on 

installation. As part of that review, the Department may consider 

requirements on the disclosure of general information relating to high winds 

and hurricanes, and may coordinate with FEMA on the development of a brochure 

on hurricane awareness and protection for occupants of manufactured homes. 














(



Note:



 Other specific comments that have become moot as a result of the 

decision not to proceed with changes in Wind Zone I and requirements relating 

to a permanent foundation system are not addressed in this preamble.) 





III. Description of Changes to the Standards 





Because of the risk of loss of life to building occupants and the 

extraordinary loss of property due to Hurricane Andrew, the Department has 

determined that it is necessary to amend the Federal Manufactured Home 

Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to raise the level of wind 

resistance standards, especially in areas subject to high winds. 

Specifically, the Department is amending the FMHCSS to include a Basic Wind 

Zone Map that is based on the map contained in the incorporated standard 

ASCE 7&hyph;88, ``Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.'' 

The revised map contains a more concentrated area for the 100 mph wind 

zone than was specified in the current standard or the proposed rule. The 

boundary between Wind Zones I and II follows the 90 mph isotach on the 

ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map, while the boundary between Wind Zones II and 

III remains the 100 mph isotach indicated in the proposed rule. The design 

wind speeds for high wind areas are designated as 100 mph for Wind Zone II and 

110 mph for Wind Zone III. This rule does not change the current design wind 

speed for Wind Zone I. 

Based on the revised map, this final rule enumerates the States, 

Territories, and local governments in which the more stringent standards will 

be applicable. The enumerated areas are those that the Department has 

determined to be at least partially within the higher wind zones demarcated on 

the revised map. The Department also will monitor local building code 

requirements and will consider adoption through rulemaking of requirements for 

manufactured homes that are comparable to any more stringent requirements 

established for site-built homes by a State or local building authority. 

The current wind standard for manufactured housing is considered 

inadequate because it addresses only positive (external) design wind pressures 

for walls, components, windows, and cladding, without specifying that designs 

must take into account the effect of negative pressure (suction) on these 

building elements, as well as internal pressures on walls and roof/ceiling 

systems. The formulae used in ASCE 7&hyph;88 also include other factors, which 

account for higher uplift forces on roof eaves, ridges, overhangs, and 

corners. These and other issues are now addressed in high wind areas by 

requiring the manufactured home structure, components, and cladding to be 

designed to resist design wind forces for Exposure C, as specified in 

ASCE 7&hyph;88.

CREW TRAPPED IN CAPSIZED OIL RIG IN GULF; 


HURRICANE PERILS TEXAS, LOUISIANA 




By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, Times Staff Writer 




HOUSTON 




Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana 
coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work 
vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. 


Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was 
plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter. The Coast Guard also said 
there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another 
boat. 


Rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for 
survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves. The hope was 
that at least some of the crew would be in airtight cabins with enough oxygen 
to survive until help reached them. But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead 
said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in 
excess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building. 


Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that 
Chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the 
lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. 


The 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., 
capsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La. It is a self-propelled vessel 
with legs that can be extended to the ocean floor. The boat was ordered into 
port because of the impending storm. 


Late Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of 
Galveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h. Officials at the 
National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land 
some time this afternoon or evening. 


The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the 
western Louisiana or upper Texas coast. Hurricane warnings were issued from 
Freeport, Tex., to Morgan City. Tropical storm warnings were issued as far 
south as Port O'Connor, Tex., and as far east as Mobile, Ala. Bob Ebaugh, a 
weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was 
expected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas. 


Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf 
Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through 
early fall. Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane 
staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows. 


One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should 
the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane. In that event, the 
Houston area would have "extensive flooding," said Bill Evans, flood watch 
director for the Harris County Flood Control District. 


Besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 
feet above normal. Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the 
hurricane season June 1. Tropical Storm Allison dumped huge amounts of rain on 
Texas and Louisiana in June, and Tropical Storm Barry dissipated in the 
Atlantic without reaching land.

the use of the 1991 NDS without exception, which lowers earlier manufactured housing industry projections of the
lumber changes and estimated costs for complying with the new standards.







Scope of Requirements











Comment:



 The prescriptive standards in the proposed rule would eliminate the ability of manufacturers to be innovative in
developing safer and more attractive homes.







Response:



 A number of the prescriptive standards in the proposed rule have been removed in the final rule. For those that remain,
manufacturers can utilize 24 CFR 3282.14, to take advantage of the Department's policy encouraging innovation through
alternative construction.







Comment:



 Because the proposed rule was largely justified as a response to damages incurred in hurricane-prone areas, the standards
and time frames contained in the proposed rule should not be applied to other zones subject to lower wind speeds.







Response:



 At this time the Department has deleted the proposed changes to Zone I from the final rule. Therefore, homes designated
to be sited in Zone I must comply with the previous wind standard for those areas. However, many commenters and the Advisory
Council indicated that the Department should strive to bring the Federal standards to a level of comparability with
conventional housing standards. The Department will review existing wind standards in the remaining areas of the
country for possible future action.







Choice of Standard











Comment:



 The Department has not demonstrated that ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the appropriate standard to be adopted for the higher wind
loading requirements. For example, the Standard Building Code may be a more appropriate standard for the purposes
of this rule.







Response:



 A number of engineers have written in support of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard, noting that the standard was developed
based on scientific studies performed in wind tunnels, which were subsequently verified by tests on full-scale structures.
By adopting the Southern Florida Building Code (SFBC), which incorporates the Standard Building Code, the people
of south Florida thought they were protected by one of the toughest building codes, with respect to wind. However,
the wind load requirements of the SFBC now have been surpassed by other codes that are based on recent research. For
example, the SFBC does not reflect peak gusts or use pressure coefficients as high as are now considered suitable.
As a result, the SFBC design wind speed of 120 mph would only correspond to a design wind speed of less than 100 mph for
many elements of the construction. As previously noted in this preamble, Dade County has adopted (effective January
1, 1994) the wind loads section of ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only.







Comment:



 No model code has adopted the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. The Department does not justify its attempt to impose more stringent
standards for manufactured housing than are applied to site-built homes. It is an abuse of Federal authority to impose
standards that go well beyond any State building code currently in existence (87).







Response:



 The relationship between the model codes and ASCE 7&hyph;88 is discussed earlier in the preamble in the section on
Development and Adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88. In addition, the Department notes that the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard already
is incorporated into its Minimum Property Standards (24 CFR part 200, subpart S), which apply to certain site-built
housing within the Department's jurisdiction.



The current wind load requirements for manufactured housing for high wind zones correspond to a wind speed of 80 mph;
other types of housing are subject to much higher design wind speed requirements in the same high wind areas. Therefore,
as noted by the AARP in its comments (150), adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88 actually will ensure substantial equivalence
of wind design requirements between manufactured and site-built housing.



Furthermore, Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties in Florida have adopted ASCE 7&hyph;88 (with the 110 mph wind
load) for site-built homes, and the Department believes other coastal jurisdictions will follow. Model codes also
have adopted or are moving toward the adoption of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. In fact, by not including the higher
standards for the remainder of the country (Zone I), a majority of manufactured homes produced in this country will
comply to a standard well below the building codes currently in existence for site-built housing.







Comment:



 The Department should recognize ``deemed-to-comply'' standards.







Response:



 The Department considered the deemed-to-comply standards, but determined that a performance standard would allow
manufacturers flexibility to be innovative in their approach to compliance with the standards. Such innovation
will reduce the cost associated with strict adherence to the deemed-to-comply standards.







Comment:



 The rule expands the ASCE 7&hyph;88 definition of ``components and cladding'' to include exterior coverings and
fastenings, and the limited availability of these materials may make compliance difficult (221).







Response:



 The Department has made alternative provisions in the standard for adequate resistance of exterior coverings to
specified design wind pressure requirements.







Enforcement











Comment:



 The proposed rule did not address testing issues. The Department does not specify whether the proposed structural
design changes have been subjected to destruction testing. (144) Although there is no agreement on a testing protocol,
truss suppliers will need time to retest their many truss designs. (8, 16, and incorporated by reference in others)
The need to test many types of siding, siding gauges (thicknesses), and accessories, fasteners, and fastener patterns
also may lead to tooling changes, which will require more time. (9)







Response:



 Testing will continue to be evaluated under the DAPIA review process, which is not revised by this rule. However, the
Department has extended, to 180 days (or, for some provisions, one year) from today's publication of the rule, the
implementation schedule for the new requirements, in order to give producers sufficient time to comply with the standards.







Comment:



 The existence of multiple wind zones and corresponding requirements within a single State creates difficulties
with respect to enforcement, as well as with production. It is not clear who bears the responsibility for monitoring
the placement of homes within a wind zone for which they are intended (87, 91, 92, 610).

HURRICANE HITS EAST TEXAS, LOSES PUNCH AFTER LANDFALL 




From Associated Press 




HIGH ISLAND, Tex. 




Hurricane Chantal roared ashore Tuesday on the upper Texas Gulf Coast with 80 
m.p.h. winds and driving rain, killing one person and leaving scattered power 
outages and flooding but apparently causing little serious damage. 


The storm was blamed for the death of a man who fell from an oil platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. No injuries were reported in Texas. 


The hurricane's sustained wind speed never exceeded 80 m.p.h. and decreased to 
75 m.p.h. as it moved inland. About three hours after the storm made landfall 
Tuesday morning at High Island, it had weakened further and was downgraded to a 
tropical storm. 


Thirteen people had been plucked from capsized fishing vessels in the stormy 
Gulf of Mexico by Coast Guard helicopter crews. The Coast Guard also sent a 
patrol boat and a jet into the storm Tuesday to take water pumps to two shrimp 
boats in trouble. 


Up to 15 inches of rain was forecast for parts of eastern Texas, where many 
areas remained saturated from a tropical storm six weeks ago. Meteorologists 
said that with rivers and creeks still high from the earlier rain, residents in 
low flood-prone areas should take precautions. 


A Galveston shelter housed some 1,000 people for the night, but it was closed 
by midday as the worst of the storm passed. Shelters in Port Arthur and 
Beaumont were vacant by mid-morning after only about an inch of rain fell. 


About 30 people spent the night at the high school in High Island, a lightly 
populated fishing and resort community midway between Port Arthur and 
Galveston. 


"My house started to move and it's not a mobile home," said Jim Chaney, of 
nearby Crystal Beach. "That's about the time we decided we should be moving 
along." 


"We were real lucky," added Donny Jones, who lives near High Island. His home 
suffered minor damage when a 60-year-old pecan tree blew over. 


In Houston, winds up to 40 m.p.h. caused downtown skyscrapers to sway and 
creak, but no damage was reported. 


Roofs were blown off a few houses and some utility poles were blown down along 
the coast. 


At High Island, barrels rolled along roads and the metal roof of a Veterans of 
Foreign Wars hall was shredded. Residents lost power although the few 
businesses in town remained open. 


"We get worse thunderstorms than this," said Betty Barrow, a 28-year resident 
of High Island. "People are always casual about these things here. The 
old-timers don't worry about these things; they just stay."

be determined using an appropriate complex terrain screening procedure (e.g., CTSCREEN) and should be documented
in the monitoring/modeling protocol. The necessary meteorological measurements should be obtained from an appropriately
sited meteorological tower augmented by SODAR if the representative plume height(s) of interest exceed 100m. The
meteorological tower need not exceed the lesser of the representative plume height of interest (the highest plume
height if there is more than one plume height of interest) or 100m.

Stability Categories. 



The (P&hyph;G) stability categories, as originally defined, couple near-surface measurements of wind speed with
subjectively determined insolation assessments based on hourly cloud cover and ceiling height observations. The
wind speed measurements are made at or near 10m. The insolation rate is typically assessed using observations of cloud
cover and ceiling height based on criteria outlined by Turner.50 In the absence of site specific observations of cloud
cover and ceiling height, it is recommended that the P&hyph;G stability category be estimated using the solar radiation/delta-T
(SRDT) method described in section 6.4.4.2 of reference 66. This method requires measurements of total solar radiation
during the daytime and temperature difference (



D



) at night (see Temperature Difference Measurements), coupled with average wind speed at 10m above ground level.
This technique is modified slightly from that published by Bowen et al. (1983),136 has been evaluated with three on-site
data bases,137 and allows practical and reasonable implementation of the preferred Turner method.55

Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic 
whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach goers out to sea and capsizing boats from 
Maine to New York. But by late in the day, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 
m.p.h. and it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 
miles south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane 
Center in Florida said. Earlier, at least six people were reported missing and 
three people apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the 
sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high, even on some rivers. "People 
shouldn't be out there," said Jarred Randall, a Narragansett, R.I., police 
sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from the water.

Summary of NIST Report 





As part of its review of the adequacy of the Federal Manufactured 

Housing Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS), the Department contracted 

for a study by Dr. Richard D. Marshall of the National Institute of Standards 

and Technology (NIST) [Report NISTIR 5189, May 1993]. According to Dr. 

Marshall and several other investigative reports, damage to manufactured homes 

in Hurricane Andrew ranged from loss of roofing to total destruction. In 

general, HUD-labeled units suffered less damage than did pre-HUD units. 

However, conventional residential construction adjacent to manufactured home 

parks performed better, in some instances significantly better, than did 

manufactured homes. Based on wind speed assessments and damage surveys, it 

appears that HUD-labeled manufactured homes began to experience damage to roof 

and wall coverings at fastest-mile wind speeds of up to 95 mph (43 m/s), and 

significant structural damage at wind speeds of from 100 to 120 mph (45 to 54 

m/s). 

Commonly observed failures included loss of roof membranes and blow-off 

of roof sheathing, failure of uplift straps at truss-to-wall connections where 

staple crowns pulled through the strap, loss of cladding on endwalls and near 

corners where large negative (suction) pressures developed, loss of 

appurtenances with resultant missile damage and damage to the primary house 

unit at connection points, complete separation of the superstructure from the 

floor and chassis frame, and loss of the complete unit because of the failure 

of tiedown straps or the withdrawal of soil anchors. The NIST report also 

pointed out that the capacity of the anchors appeared to have exceeded the 

marginal resistance of the superstructure, and that if the superstructure 

separation failures had not occurred, the number of anchor systems failures 

could have been much more widespread. 

In almost every case in Florida, some form of anchoring had been 

installed. Outside the area of strongest winds, there were relatively few 

anchor failures. Within the radius of strongest winds, anchor failures that 

were observed involved 2 ft. (610 mm) helical ground anchors (some embedded in 

about 3 cu.ft. (0.8 cu.m) of concrete) or rock anchors into coral. No 

failures of 4 ft. (1.2 m) helical anchors were noted. However, it is not 

clear that any anchors of that length were actually installed in the area 

subjected to the highest winds. 

Dr. Marshall of NIST compared wind load provisions of the current FMHCSS 

with the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard ANSI/ASCE 7&hyph;88, 

the South Florida Building Code, the Standard Building Code, and wind design 

provisions proposed by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Based on these 

comparisons of design loads for manufactured housing units of typical 

dimension and geometry, considering the rationale for using importance factors 

and unreduced pressure coefficients, and in view of the fact that it is a true 

consensus standard, Dr. Marshall concluded that ANSI/ASCE

 7&hyph;88 should be the 

basis for updating the wind load requirements for manufactured housing. In 

addition, since the NIST study only addressed design loads, in the interest of 

safety and economy, it was also recommended that prescriptive requirements of 

the proposed standard be consistent with the specified design loads and that 

testing and analysis to assure this consistency be conducted. 





ASCE 7&hyph;88: Consensus Procedures for Development and Adoption 





The ASCE, founded in 1852, is the oldest civil engineering organization 

in the United States and has a membership of more than 110,000. The ANSI/ASCE 

Standard 7&hyph;88, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures 

(November 1990) (ASCE 7&hyph;88, in this preamble), was developed by ASCE based on 

studies conducted at academic and research institutions in the United States 

and other parts of the world. 

ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the only truly consensus minimum design load standard 

currently available in the United States. The ASCE rules, approved by the 

American National Standards Institute (ANSI), require all standards committees 

to have a membership balanced between producers, consumers, building 

officials, and general interest groups. Each of these groups represents 

between 20% to 40% of the committee membership. At the time ASCE 7&hyph;88 was 

adopted, 89 members were on the standards committee. 

The approval or revision of an ASCE standard is an elaborate process, 

which involves extensive balloting and resolution of all negative votes. When 

a standard is to be adopted, the standards committee is broken down by 

expertise into task committees. Those task committees draft the standard and 

present it to the full standards committee for balloting. All objections 

within the standards committee are satisfied by one of three ways: (1) the 

objector agrees to withdraw the objection; (2) by a vote of 75%, the full 

committee accepts the objection and changes the standard; or (3) by a vote of 

75%, the full committee rejects the objection. The full committee then votes 

on the standard. 

In order for the standard to pass the full standards committee, at least 

65% of the committee membership must vote and 75% of those votes must be in 

the affirmative. Moreover, the affirmative votes cannot be less than 55% of 

the approved voting membership. After the standard passes the standards 

committee, it is issued to the public for further comment. As in the 

standards committee, all objections are individually considered and processed 

in the same manner (i.e., withdrawn or accepted or rejected by a vote of 75% 

of the standards committee). After a certain cutoff date and after all 

objections are addressed, the standard is published as an ASCE consensus 

standard.

Administrators International (BOCA); the Standard Building Code (SBC) of the 

Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI); or the Uniform 

Building Code (UBC) of International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO). 

Wind load provisions in these model building codes are based on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 

standard, but with some modifications. 

The ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard considers all of the factors that influence the 

magnitude of wind loads on a building. In addition to wind speed, those 

factors include: (1) Terrain surrounding the building, (2) shape of the 

building, and (3) desired safety of the building frame and components. The 

model building codes use most of these factors from ASCE 7&hyph;88, but modify some 

of the factors based on experience; because of tradition, other factors are 

not considered. 

Some provisions of model building codes are adopted from industry 

manuals. The use, adoption, and modification of wind-load factors by the 

model building codes result from an attempt to simplify the wind-load 

provisions and react to the concerns of affected industries and special 

interest groups. In general, these modifications by model code agencies 

result in lower design requirements for wind forces than would be required 

under ASCE 7&hyph;88. 

Even with these modifications, final wind loads for most buildings are 

fairly consistent in all model building codes. All three of the major model 

building codes incorporate the basic wind speed map of ASCE 7&hyph;88, and 

reference the ASCE standard in whole or in part, but either modify the 

standard or require additional prescriptive design and construction 

provisions. In addition, all three provide the use of ASCE 7&hyph;88 as an 

alternative to be applied at the discretion of the designer. 

However, the model building codes do not cover the design or 

construction of manufactured housing. The only control local governments have 

over manufactured housing and mobile (manufactured) home parks is through 

certain zoning regulations, or anchoring, set-up, or installation 

requirements. As noted by one commenter (150) and discussed in the next 

section of this preamble, incorporation of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard will be 

critical to ensuring continued acceptance of manufactured housing by local 

jurisdictions in high wind areas. 





Building Codes in Southern Florida 





Generally, the local jurisdictions in Florida have adopted modifications 

of the SBC or South Florida Building Code (SFBC). As one of its primary 

recommendations in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the 18-member Dade 

County, Florida, Grand Jury stated that the 35-year-old South Florida Building 

Code must be rewritten to duplicate the tougher, national wind standard of 

ASCE 7&hyph;88. The Grand Jury recognized ASCE 7&hyph;88 as a standard that more 

adequately reflects the design strength necessary for windows and doors. In 

acknowledgment of the Grand Jury's recommendations, the Dade County Building 

Code Committee adopted (effective January 1, 1994) the Wind Loads section of 

ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only. The Grand Jury further recommended 

that Dade County officials issue a moratorium on the permanent replacement of 

manufactured homes until officials could be assured that the replacement homes 

meet the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standards. Further, noting that lower standards are 

applied to manufactured housing than to conventional housing, the 1992 Fall 

Term Grand Jury asserted that ``the low standard amounted to discrimination 

against those persons unable to afford the costs of conventional housing.'' 

In its Final Report, filed August 4, 1993, the Dade County Grand Jury 

referenced the initial Grand Jury findings regarding the engineering 

advantages of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard and commended its adoption into the SFBC. 

The Grand Jury reported that: 








[T]his additional and essential modification of the SFBC should 

provoke a wide-ranging improvement of most of our building 

designs, methods and products. It should also result in the 

building of structures that will provide greater safety and 

security during a hurricane. 










In order to protect those living in and near manufactured homes, the Grand 

Jury has reiterated the recommendation that a moratorium be instituted on the 

installation in the County of any new mobile homes that do not meet the wind-loading standards of ASCE 7&hyph;88. 





In addition, the SBCCI, after assessing the damage caused by Hurricane 

Andrew, concluded that standards applicable to manufactured housing need to be 

reviewed to bring them up to the level of other construction types, unless 

society is willing to consider manufactured homes to be expendable. The SBCCI 

said that even if manufactured homes are considered expendable, the issue of 

the hazard they present to neighboring buildings and structures needs to be 

addressed. Accordingly, they further concluded that steps need to be taken to 

strengthen the structural frame, enforce tiedown provisions, and assure that 

the installation of homes is done by those who are knowledgeable in the 

requirements of the code. Unless these issues are addressed, the SBCCI 

believes there will continue to be great costs associated with hurricane 

damage. 





Improved Anchoring and Foundation Systems 





Enforcement of anchoring and tie-down systems for manufactured housing 

construction has generally been considered a State or local government and 

their building officials' responsibility. Section 3282.303 of the 

Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282) 

urges, but does not require, State Administrative Agencies to monitor 

installation of manufactured homes. Thus, standards for foundations and 

anchorings and enforcement of those standards are not uniform among the 

States, and in some States are nonexistent. For example, the State of Florida 

has statewide laws related to installation, but enforcement of those laws is 

left to local building officials, while Louisiana is one of 23 States that 

does not regulate installation of manufactured homes at all.

HGSYSTEM estimates the expected area of exposure to concentrations above user-specified threshold values. By imposing
conservation of mass, momentum and energy the concentration, density, speed and temperature are evaluated as a function
of downwind distance. 







g. Plume Behavior 







1. HFPLUME and PLUME: (1) are steady-state models assuming a top-hat profile with cross-section averaged plume variables;
and (2) the momentum equation is taken into account for horizontal ambient shear, gravity, ground collision, gravity-slumping
pressure forces and ground-surface drag. 



2. HEGADAS: assumes the heavy cloud to move with the ambient wind speed, and adopts a power-law fit of the ambient wind
speed for the velocity profile. 



3. PGPLUME: simulates the passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point from HFPLUME or PLUME for steady-state
and finite duration releases. 







h. Horizontal Winds 







A power law fit of the ambient wind speed is used. 







i. Vertical Wind Speed 







Not treated. 







j. Horizontal Dispersion 







1. HFPLUME and PLUME: Plume dilution is caused by air entrainment resulting from high plume speeds, trailing vortices
in wake of falling plume (before touchdown), ambient turbulence and density stratification. Plume dispersion is
assumed to be steady and momentum-dominated, and effects of downwind diffusion and wind meander (averaging time)
are not taken into account. 



2. HEGADAS: This model adopts a concentration similarity profile expressed in terms of an unknown center-line ground-level
concentration and unknown vertical/cross-wind dispersion parameters. These quantities are determined from a
number of basic equations describing gas-mass conservation, air entrainment (empirical law describing vertical
top-entrainment in terms of global Richardson number), cross-wind gravity spreading (initial gravity spreading
followed by gravity-current collapse) and cross-wind diffusion (Briggs formula). 



3. PGPLUME: It assumes a Gaussian concentration profile in which the cross-wind and vertical dispersion coefficients
are determined by empirical expressions. All unknown parameters in this profile are determined by imposing appropriate
matching criteria at the transition point. 







k. Vertical Dispersion 







See description above. 







l. Chemical Transformation 







Not treated. 







m. Physical Removal 







Not treated. 







n. Evaluation Studies 







1. PLUME has been validated against field data for releases of liquified propane, and wind tunnel data for buoyant
and vertically-released dense plumes. HFPLUME and PLUME have been validated against field data for releases of HF
(Goldfish experiments) and propane releases. In addition, the plume rise algorithms have been tested against Hoot,
Meroney, and Peterka, Ooms and Petersen databases. HEGADAS has been validated against steady and transient releases
of liquid propane and LNG over water (Maplin Sands field data), steady and finite-duration pressurized releases
of HF (Goldfish experiments; linked with HFPLUME), instantaneous release of Freon (Thorney Island field data; linked
with the box model HEGABOX) and wind tunnel data for steady, isothermal dispersion.

and FEMA have also reported a total of 11,213 manufactured homes destroyed in 

Florida and Louisiana in Hurricane Andrew, and an additional 3,016 

manufactured homes experienced major damage. Almost 36% of all housing units 

destroyed during Hurricane Andrew were manufactured homes. 

The loss of these units had implications extending beyond the loss of 

the homes and possessions of their owners. These homes, shredded by the 

winds, also became dangerous flying missiles, inflicting more property damage 

on neighboring structures. 

In its October 1992 report on Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Emergency 

Management Agency (FEMA) stated that, ``in all areas, mobile homes 

(manufactured housing) were most susceptible to damage or destruction. Many 

mobile homes imploded from the wind loads of Hurricane Andrew. In coastal 

areas, where mobile homes were properly `cradled' and elevated, the cradled 

foundations remained intact, but the mobile homes mounted to these foundations 

were often heavily damaged or destroyed.'' 

Concerns for potential losses during high winds in coastal and other 

areas were identified previously in a May 1991 report by the Federal Emergency 

Management Agency (FEMA), which predicted that the United States can expect 

more hurricanes of greater intensity during the 1990s and early 2000s than it 

has experienced in recent years. Furthermore, estimates suggest that by the 

year 2010 the population density on Florida's coasts will have increased about 

130 percent from the 1988 level. Moreover, as the national population ages, 

an increasing percentage of coastal inhabitants will probably be older 

individuals, a group more likely to occupy manufactured houses. The American 

Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reports that 40 percent of the 

purchasers of new manufactured homes are at least 50 years old. The elderly 

can be more difficult to evacuate and may be more prone to be injured during 

periods of extreme high winds. 

The technology for achieving economical wind resistant designs in 

housing is available. It involves calculations of risk for extreme wind-prone 

coastal areas and the establishment of construction standards based upon these 

risk calculations. Through use and implementation of this approach, risks of 

injury and death can be minimized and economic loss limited to acceptable 

levels in coastal areas subject to high winds. 

In determining a course of action to address these issues, the 

Department had to balance two competing concerns: (1) The need to raise 

manufactured housing standards, to protect individuals, their homes, and their 

neighbors from future high winds; and (2) the need to preserve the 

affordability of a key source of low-cost housing. This rule is the result of 

the Department's decision to improve protection of homeowners in hurricane- 

prone areas as soon as possible, but to delay making changes to the standards 

in lower wind-risk areas, in order to give adequate consideration to cost 

factors. Although the changes are expected to increase costs to consumers in 

the high-wind areas, the Department has concluded that the increases are 

justified, because the improved standards will significantly reduce future 

losses to occupants and the public by strengthening the features that make 

manufactured homes vulnerable to damage and destruction in high winds. 

Perhaps more importantly, the improved standards may help avoid the 

inestimable costs of devastation to people's lives and emotional health and to 

the communities, in the likelihood that another powerful hurricane hits a 

community of manufactured homes in the hurricane-prone regions of the country. 





Field Investigations_Hurricane Andrew 





Among the major deficiencies contributing to manufactured housing damage 

in Hurricane Andrew were inadequate connections between exterior roof or wall 

coverings and supporting sheathing or framing and between walls, roofs and 

floors. In particular, losses of roof coverings were widespread, and were 

considered by some to be the first mode of failure for manufactured homes 

damaged in Hurricane Andrew. Other roof-related damage was due to loss of 

sheathing, failure of connections, or a combination of these problems. 

Numerous failures of uplift straps also occurred, when the staples pulled out 

through the metal straps, permitting the straps to tear away from the members 

to which they had been fastened. In some cases, entire sections of roofs were 

blown away. 

Another common area of failure was loss of exterior wall siding. Metal 

or plastic siding used in manufactured housing was readily damaged or 

penetrated by flying debris during the high winds in Hurricane Andrew. Loss 

of roof or wall cladding allows the building to be penetrated by the weather 

and has far-reaching consequences beyond the area of envelope integrity. 

As a result of these losses, and damage to windows and doors, there was 

significant water damage and deterioration to many manufactured homes. In 

addition, failure of coverings or attachments to the manufactured home 

structure also caused missile-type damage to other homes.

HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US
history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana,
inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the
low-lying city of New Orleans.
The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed
north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday
night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun
country.
Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was
much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to
total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior
member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per
hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City,
Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles
west of New Orleans.
Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday
afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained
windspeeds were below 75 mph.
Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and
thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths
in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining
industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was
cut.
The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said
that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn
of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property,
he said.
In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose
basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band
across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house
sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill
in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and
shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been
badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and
health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all
water.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the
insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have
raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 26 -- Research in atmospheric 
science has received a boost with the commissioning of a unique 
radar at Gadanki near Tirupati, which will also ensure safe 
rocket launchings from Sriharikota, launched 80 km away, reports 
PTI. 
  With this new facility, Indian scientists will be able to 
make a detailed study of lower and middle atmospheres and also 
the region of the ionosphere above 100 km, according to Dr P. 
Balarama Rao, director of this radar facility. 
  A link-up of this radar with control room at Sri Harikota 
will enable space scientists to watch out for turbulence and 
wind shears before a rocket is launched. 
  Called Mesophere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar, the Rs 100 
million-facility has been established jointly by five different 
agencies, including, space and defence departments. 
  It consists of a 1024 computer-controlled antenna, arranged 
in 32 rows, whose powerful beam at 53 mega-hertz frequency can 
be aimed at six pre-set directions. 
  Echoes received from the atmosphere are analysed by a 
computer, giving almost instantaneous readings of wind speeds at 
different heights. 
  Atmospheric scientists all over India will have access to 
this MST radar, said to be one of the very few in the world, and 
perhaps the only radar close to the Equator, where the 
atmospheric processes are quite different from those at higher 
latitudes. 
  According to Dr Balarama Rao, the radar will have 
applications ranging from short-term weather forecasting to 
long-term vertical transports of trace elements. It will measure 
vertical wind speeds that cannot be measured from any other 
technique. 
  Dr Rao said the radar also provided Indians the unique 
opportunity to observe "gravity waves" generated by tropical jet 
streams, storms, and interaction of strong winds with large 
mountains. 
  The radar will take only a minute or two to detect wind 
shears and turbulences that could pose hazards to rockets in 
flight.
