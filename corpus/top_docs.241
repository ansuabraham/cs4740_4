  [Text] Caracas, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera carried out his first cabinet change, only 117 
days after the start of his government and in the mist of a 
profound economic crisis. 
  Caldera, who assumed the presidency on 2 February, appointed 
Alberto Poletto, Luis Carlos Palacios, Ciro Zaa, and Carlos 
Bernandez as ministers of Development, Central Office of 
Coordination and Planning [Cordiplan], Transport and 
Communication, and Venezuelan Investment Fund, respectively. 
  Caldera's restructuring of his cabinet has been interpreted 
by local political experts as a sign that the president is 
prepared to make a switch to an economic policy less populist 
than the one he proposed during the elections campaign and 
closer to the neoliberal policy implemented by former president 
Carlos Andres Perez. 
  Apparently, Caldera, who was one of the most severe critics 
of the free market policy promoted by Perez, has been unable to 
structure an economic formula out of the neoliberal guidelines. 
  Venezuela is living through a difficult economic situation, 
with a fiscal deficit estimated at more than $4.5 billion, a 
severe depreciation of the bolivar, and an explosive social 
situation fueled by a significant fall in the purchasing power 
of the people. 
  President Caldera put Carlos Bernandez at the head of the 
organization in charge of privatizing state enterprises. 
Bernandez has always been linked to the local banking sector and 
he has been president of the Bank of Venezuela, which is one of 
the most important banks in the country. Bernandez has offered 
to increase the privatization process. The local media has 
described his appointment as a victory for the financial sector, 
which was able to produce the departure of Abdon Vivas Teran, a 
politician very close to Caldera and to his electoral offer for 
an economy with a human face, from the Venezuela Investment Fund. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the new Cordiplan minister, replaces 
Enzo del Bufalo, a dissonant voice in Caldera's economic team. 
The new minister is closer to the free economy concepts that the 
Caldera administration apparently wants to adopt in this new 
phase. 
  Also, Alberto Poletto, president of the Foreign Trade 
Institute, will be development minister, which joins these 
departments to create the Industry and Commerce Ministry. 
  Ciro Zaa has been virtually forced to leave the Urban 
Development Ministry to take over the Transport and 
Communication Ministry vacated by Cesar Quintini, who was 
accused of maintaining an attitude of tolerance in multiple 
cases of corruption in his ministry. 
  Zaa will be replaced by Francisco Gonzalez, former president 
of the Urban Development fund. The responsibilities of Special 
Affairs Minister Pompeyo Marquez have been expanded and from now 
on he will also be responsible for the government's social 
programs.

<F P=106> [Report by Fabiola Vecchionacce from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera attended an event held to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan 
Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry]. President Rafael Caldera criticized price increases 
of certain products as well as profiteering in the sale of 
dollars, which are acts of corruption that should be fought. 
That was part of Caldera's speech during the celebration of the 
50th anniversary of Fedecamaras. President Caldera pointed out 
that all sectors of society must join Solidarity's efforts so it 
can make progress. 
  Caldera also talked about the importance of opening up 
opportunities for foreign investment by providing greater legal 
guarantees. He said private and public corruption must be 
fought. Let us listen to excerpts of what Caldera said. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] We have seen how the prices of 
certain products have been increased. The Venezuelan people are 
undoubtedly being hurt by this. It is an act of corruption that 
we have to fight. We know that [words indistinct]. That is why 
an atmosphere such as this, with a spirit of friendship and of 
solidarity, can lead us to expect that we can all make an 
effort. Just as the Venezuelan private sector condemns a 
government official who steals the people's money through public 
works that are built, it should also condemn a private sector 
member, who buys dollars to resell them for an undue profit. 
[end recording] 
  In addition, President Caldera agreed with Fedecamaras 
President Edgar Romero Navas that the fight against inflation 
must not be stopped because, according to Romero Navas, the 
country requires a series of changes. Romero Navas also said 
coherence and compromise are needed in the executive cabinet. 
He said our business and political criteria on the handling of 
the country's resources should also be taken into account.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] ...the Investment Fund of Venezuela [FIV] and former 
Bank of Venezuela President Carlos Bernardez Losada was 
appointed to the post. Observers believe President Caldera's 
decision to remove FIV President Abdon Vivas Teran was prompted 
by the way he handled Aeropostal's privatization, which was 
considered a failure because the bid was declared invalid. 
  It is also said the decision was prompted by the rejection 
of 
Air Force Commander General Otto Garcia Rivara, who reportedly 
objected to the fact that one of the enterprises participating 
in the bid was a Colombian airline. He believes Aeropostal is a 
strategic Venezuelan company, and one must take into account the 
border problems we have with our neighbor. 
  OCI [Central Information Office] chief Guillermo Alvarez 
explained that Abdon Vivas Teran will remain in the government 
even though he has left the FIV. This means he will possibly be 
appointed to another post in the ministerial cabinet. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez] I cannot report new changes. 
These are the ones the president authorized us to announce today. 
  [Briceno] Does this mean Mr. Abdon Vivas Teran is now out of 
the government? 
  [Alvarez] He is obviously out of the post he held. This does 
not mean he is out of the government. [end recording] 
  Alvarez announced Alberto Poletto will still be in charge of 
the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. This situation might 
propitiate a merger of the ICE and the Development Ministry, 
which would become the industry and commerce ministry. 
  Ciro Zaa Alvarez has been appointed to the MTC [Ministry of 
Transportation and Communications]. Zaa was formerly in charge 
of the Urban Development Ministry and Francisco Gonzalez, 
current president of the Urban Development Fund, was temporarily 
appointed to the post. President Caldera's plans include the 
unification of these infrastructure ministries. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios has been appointed to the Central 
Office 
of Coordination and Planning, replacing Enzo del Bufalo, who 
tendered his official resignation to the head of state. Another 
appointment made by President Caldera was that of Alfredo 
Gruber, current president of Palmaven in the Venezuelan 
Petroleum Corporation who will be in charge of the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana. 
  To conclude, Pompeyo Marquez has been given responsibility 
for coordinating the government's social programs. The new 
ministers will be sworn in by President Caldera on Monday [30 
May] at Miraflores Palace.

newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said that the most 
prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading rumors. He added 
that this, however, is countered by reality because our 
democratic system is firm and stable. Caldera made this 
statement during a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva at the Yellow House. Caldera 
recalled that recently rumors persistently circulated in the 
country about his presumed death, which had to stop when all 
Venezuelans confirmed that he was totally active. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] I am convinced that the democratic 
system in my country is a firm and stable reality, and will be 
maintained despite all the rumors unleashed by those who are 
interested in creating situations of violence and instability, 
taking advantage of the grave circumstances of an economic 
crisis. We are all aware of the seriousness of this crisis and 
we know that we must make great efforts to overcome it. [end 
recording] 
  Caldera attributed the fall of the bolivar to the wave of 
rumors, which in turn has increased inflation. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] We are fighting against inflation, 
but rumors are the main cause for its increase. We are facing a 
situation of shortages and price fluctuations in which 
speculators take advantage of any factor or announcement that 
the inflation rate is up to increase prices to unacceptable 
levels. We will handle this problem with courage and 
determination. [end recording] 
  President Caldera said that despite the crisis in the 
financial system, the fact that foreign investors are still 
interested in investing in our country is proof that Venezuela 
will be able to overcome this crisis and reactivate its economy. 
  Meanwhile, Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said that 
his country is willing to assist Venezuela under the current 
circumstances and to strengthen commercial ties between both 
countries.

  [Text] Maracay -- The National Armed Forces [FAN] will 
respect the decision by President-elect Rafael Caldera, who will 
take the oath of office on 2 February as president and commander 
in chief of the FAN. 
  This was made clear by Major General Angel Rafael Montero 
Revette, inspector general of the Army, who will be the next 
minister of defense according to the statement Rafael Caldera 
made to the nation. Montero Revette presided over a ceremony in 
this city at the Maracay Branch of the Army Noncommissioned 
Officers School, where he was questioned by some journalists on 
whether there would be problems with the Caldera announcement 
regarding changes in the High Command. 
  The next defense minister said he thinks there will not be 
problems in the FAN with the appointment of a new military High 
Command, because President-elect Caldera knows very well the 
military laws and attributions he will have when he takes over 
as commander in chief. According to Gen. Montero Revette, FAN 
personnel will begin observing Rafael Caldera's decisions at the 
very moment he assumes the presidency of the Republic. He added 
that according to the Constitution, FAN personnel are 
subordinated to the civilian rule exercised by the chief 
executive. Consequently, he concluded, there will be no problems 
in this regard.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera said the stay of 
proceedings against the military personnel involved in the 4-F 
[4 February 92] and 27-N [27 November 92] events will continue 
on course as it should. 
  The president made these statements in Valencia following 
the 
ceremony for the episcopal ordination of Monsignor Reinaldo Del 
Prette Lissoi, which the president attended as the guest of 
honor. 
  [Caldera] It was a very beautiful, solemn ceremony and a 
fine 
expression of the feeling of the Venezuelan people. It was also 
a recognition of the brilliant figure of Venezuela's 
ecclesiastic youth. I am very satisfied because I think it is a 
sign of vitality, force, and faith in the Venezuela we all want. 
  [EL GLOBO] What can you tell us about the stay of 
proceedings 
against the coupists? 
  [Caldera] That will continue on course as it should. In a 
way, I am committed to the country. My conscience has committed 
me to solving this problem, which must be solved in a way that 
strengthens peace and unity in the Armed Forces and among the 
Venezuelan people. 
  [EL GLOBO] And what about the salary increase you announced? 
  [Caldera] That is being considered to see how it will be 
processed, because there are various options in the Labor Law. 
The Labor Ministry will bring it up at the next cabinet meeting. 
  [EL GLOBO] What has the governor of Carabobo State proposed 
in terms of decentralization? 
  [Caldera] It will continue in a constructive manner, because 
we want harmony between national, regional, and municipal 
authorities. 
<H5>  Support From the Governors </H5>
  Carabobo Governor Enrique Salas Romer, president of the 
Association of Governors [of Venezuela, AVG], said President 
Caldera has "the support of the AVG independent of the positions 
its members may have. We maintain our support for the person 
chosen by the people to guide the destiny of the country." 
  Salas Romer said some of the president's statements make him 
feel optimistic about Caldera's attitude toward the 
decentralization process, which "is not a goal but a reality 
based on the economic, social, educational, and political growth 
of the Venezuela that extends beyond Caracas and which also 
demands the participation of the people of Caracas."

  [Text] Caracas, 27 May (EFE) -- Enzo del Bufalo, minister 
of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning, today 
resigned in what appears to the beginning of a crisis in Rafael 
Caldera's government. 
  Del Bufalo has become the first minister of Caldera's 
government to resign from his post in the 114 days of the 
current administration. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out 
that in the coming hours other officials will leave the cabinet 
team. 
  Christian Democrat Caldera is preparing to make important 
changes in his government team, which in the eyes of his 
political adversaries, has offered an image of contradictions 
with regard to his policies, particularly in the economic field. 
The changes, it appears, are an attempt to revitalize his 
government, which appears trapped between the severity of the 
crisis and social demands. 
  Today, the Venezuelan press points out that all the 
ministers 
will place their posts at the president's disposal, thus making 
it easier for Caldera, who assumed power on 2 February, to make 
the changes he may deem necessary. 
  The opposition has accused Caldera of offering a 
contradictory image with regard to the policies that he insists 
on applying, and his ministers have found themselves in 
seriously contradictory positions. Nevertheless, it is a 
tradition of the old-time politician, who already governed 
Venezuela between 1969-74, to make his decisions under total 
secrecy until he decides to inform the nation, such as when he 
designated his cabinet a few hours before assuming the 
presidency. 
  The departure of Transport and Communication Minister Cesar 
Quintini has been reported by the Venezuelan media as a fact, 
although he has denied his resignation. Quintini is accused of 
maintaining a tolerant attitude with regard to corruption in his 
ministry. 
  Rafael Irribarren, deputy minister of transport and 
communication, resigned one month ago from his post after 
accusing Quintini of obstructing his efforts to dismantle the 
complex network of corruption that functions in that ministry. 
Irribarren charged that in his ministry, licenses, permits, and 
other official documents are sold and that commission fees are 
charged for granting concessions. 
  Local political sources claim that Quintini's continued 
presence in his post has created serious doubts about Caldera's 
will to struggle against corruption, one of the electoral 
banners that took him to the presidency. Other ministers are 
unhappy because they believe they have not received the support 
they need for a successful start to their duties. 
  In almost four months of government, Caldera has had to face 
a grave economic crisis, with a fiscal deficit of more than $4.5 
billion. The devaluation of the bolivar has become a pressing 
problem for Caldera. The dollar, which at the beginning of the 
month had been valued at 127.15 bolivares, this past Wednesday 
was valued at 175. 
  It appears that Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios 
and 
Agriculture Minister Ciro Fonseca Anez could also leave the 
government.

  [Text] As we have reported, everything seems to indicate 
that President Rafael Caldera was prompted to replace Venezuelan 
Investment Fund [FIV] Minister Abdon Vivas Teran for failing to 
sell Aeropostal through the bidding process. 
  Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the Secretariat of the 
Presidency, has admitted that the chief of state has made this 
decision, because he wants to accelerate the process of 
privatization. He has added the former minister has established 
the bases for this policy and the government will develop it: 
  [Begin recording] [Egana] He has established solid and 
important bases, and the government will continue his efforts on 
such bases. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there anything concrete in this 
regard? 
  [Egana] A plan of privatization is already under way. 
  [Reporter] What is in store for Vivas? 
  [Egana] The president of the Republic will decide. 
  [Reporter] It was said the first attempt at privatization 
has 
failed. Will changes be made? Will a new element be introduced 
to make it more effective? 
  [Egana] Using the bases already established, the government 
will try to make greater efforts to attract foreign investments 
that are needed at this time. [end recording] 
  When asked whether the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will 
have a greater role in the government in view of the changes, 
Egana has said the country has achieved greater participation 
during the administration of President Caldera.

  [Text] Caracas, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- On 1 July, President 
Rafael Caldera will unveil in Caracas new economic measures with 
which he seeks to overcome the country's economic and financial 
crisis, an official source said today. Pompeyo Marquez, special 
minister and presidential adviser, said in Maracay, an 
industrial city 80 km west of Caracas, that the plan will focus 
in particular on social programs and reactivating production. 
  To that effect, Marquez said the measures will cover three 
major areas: stockpiles--to prevent hoarding; employment; and 
training. The measures are intended to raise Venezuelans' 
standard of living, although most problems will not be totally 
resolved, Marquez noted. 
  Venezuelans are anxious following the collapse of seven 
banks 
and last week's 8.65 percent devaluation of the bolivar to the 
level of 210 bolivares to the dollar. Local economists have said 
that Caldera is leaning toward exchange rate controls, a measure 
the economy minister opposes. Marquez said he supports controls 
on prices and imports because those measures will stamp out 
speculation and capital flight.

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila said after 
meeting with President Rafael Caldera that so far no petroleum 
cooperation agreement has been reached among Russia, Cuba, and 
Venezuela, although the possibility has not been ruled out. 
  The Cuban official said talks are currently under way among 
the three states for a possible petroleum cooperation agreement 
and that each is prepared to establish a commercial operation 
that is favorable to the three countries. The Cuban vice 
president stressed, however, that the issue was not discussed 
with President Caldera because the tour of South American 
countries is focused on strengthening relations with Cuba. 
  [Begin Lage recording] We did not discuss the issue with

satisfaction with his election and stressed our desire for a 
better future for Venezuelans. [end recording] 
  In the short 24-hour visit to Venezuela, the Cuban vice

problems related to his gastrointestinal system have forced the 
minister to resign. 
  Perez Davila coordinated the health area of President Rafael 
Caldera's government and later headed the liaison commission 
with the Health and Social Welfare Ministry. 
  In spite of his youth and having a good professional record, 
today Perez Davila is leaving the ministry for health reasons. 
He expressed his regrets to President Rafael Caldera. It was 
learned yesterday morning that Perez Davila sent a letter to the 
president of the Republic in which he explained the reasons for 
his resignation. In that letter he told President Rafael Caldera 
that he is sure the work of the new authorities at the Health 
and Social Welfare Ministry will be successful, because the 
persons working in the ministry are highly qualified and 
motivated. 
  President Caldera will now have to appoint a new health and 
social welfare minister, which must be a person highly qualified 
to direct a ministry confronting a serious hospital crisis.

  [Text] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information 
Office [OCI] director, has said that, so far, the alleged 
removal of ministers from the executive cabinet are merely 
rumors, which must be denied because there are no official 
statements about it; in other words, the government is denying 
the continuous rumors on an alleged cabinet reshuffle reportedly 
planned by President Rafael Caldera. Vicente Briceno has the 
story: 
  [Begin recording] [Briceno] Alvarez reported that 
Transportation and Communication Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales 
still heads that ministry, but Quintini, who was at Miraflores 
Palace apparently attending a Council of Ministers meeting on 25 
May, refused to deny reports of his alleged removal from the 
cabinet. Alvarez noted that any governmental change is the 
decision of the president alone, thereby explaining that 
ministers are not hired, nor do they buy their posts. 
  The OCI chief rejected the existence of any ambiguity as a 
result of the division in the economic cabinet by ironically 
stating that the only division at the Council of Ministers is 
Defense Minister Division General Rafael Montero. 
  [Alvarez] There were rumors on a subject inherent to the 
president: the change, dismissal, or removal of ministers. No 
one else can make this decision. Therefore, these are 
unofficial rumors. 
  [Briceno] Despite the OCI director's statements, it is a 
fact 
that President Caldera could be thinking about revamping the 
executive cabinet. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Jun (AFP) -- The controversy regarding 
possible coup attempts in Venezuela heightened this weekend with 
new charges that implicate Defense Minister Rafael Montero 
Revette, despite denials by President Rafael Caldera. 
  Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the thwarted 
February 1992 military coup, charged in a communique to the 
media that Minister Montero Revette conspired last year against 
the then Defense Minister Radames Munoz in an alleged coup that 
did not materialize. 
  "Current Defense Minister Gen. Montero Revette was involved 
up to his neck in the military coup that Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz was going to carry out last December," Chavez states in 
his communique. The retired military officer also maintains that 
"there is plenty of evidence. The (provisional) government of 
Dr. (Ramon) Velasquez (1993) had the evidence, and his interior 
minister was fully aware of that conspiracy." 
  According to Chavez, the former minister was "protected" on 
that occasion by the ruling political parties, because "a coup 
of that sort would maintain the status quo, corruption, and the 
privileges of ruling political and economic groups and would 
quell the struggle of the people to improve their welfare." 
  Chavez was imprisoned after the coup attempt until his 
release two months ago, when he benefited from a presidential 
amnesty granted by President Caldera, within the framework of 
the Armed Forces' peace process. This amnesty led to the release 
of virtually all those implicated in the February and November 
1992 coup attempts. 
  A few days before taking office last February, Caldera asked 
Vice Admiral Munoz and the ranking military command accompanying 
him to resign. He appointed Montero Revette, who until that 
time was Army commander, the new defense minister. Although, 
with the change in the military high command and release of the 
coupist officers, Caldera managed to maintain a period of calm 
in the military sector for several months, charges of new 
conspiracies surfaced this week. 
  Alberto Muller, retired general and current senator, charged 
that Munoz is preparing a new coup, while Montero Revette said 
that "rightist and leftist" groups are conspiring. Montero 
Revette mentioned Chavez and the "Red Flag" organization, among 
other leftist groups. 
  This wave of rumors was denied this week by Caldera, who 
said 
that "the most prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading 
rumors." Caldera said: "I am convinced that the democratic 
system in my country is a firm and stable reality." Venezuela, 
which has been a representative democracy for 36 years, 
experienced two thwarted coups in 1992, and since then coup 
rumors have surfaced periodically in the country.

newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said the bolivar 
fluctuations will not affect the future of the Group of Three 
[G-3] free trade agreement. He made this statement at a joint 
news conference in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where the G-3 
countries are meeting and where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
is taking place. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] Bolivar fluctuations will not 
affect the G-3 free trade agreement, because there will always 
be ways to prevent any eventuality from obstructing the basic 
element: trade among sister nations. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has said the 
trade agreement will come into effect soon due to the rules 
previously stipulated in the treaty signed by Venezuela, 
Colombia, and Mexico. The first reaction to this treaty will 
come from investors of the three countries. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] Although an immediate deregulation 
was included in the agreement, the G-3 free trade agreement is 
of utmost importance for a number of products. We must bear in 
mind the lifting of customs duties will take 10 years; this is 
why free trade will be progressive. I believe, however, the 
same thing that happened when Mexico signed a free trade 
agreement with Chile will happen again: the doubling in trade 
within a year, because the expectations and clear-cut rules have 
made businessmen aware that there were regulations that would 
control trade and make trade grow. We hope the agreement among 
Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico will yield very significant 
results soon. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
said the prospects of this agreement regarding larger markets 
and production are compelling mechanisms with which to defeat 
poverty. The Aztec head of state was questioned about the G-3's 
contribution to help fight poverty. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We in Mexico are convinced the 
only 
way to permanently defeat poverty is to recover sustained 
economic growth, because without well-paying jobs there are no 
possibilities of permanently eradicating poverty. [end recording]

impeachment referendum, that is, the possibility that people 
could impeach any government official, including the president, 
who fails to perform his duties. He made these statements at the 
opening of a play called "Venezuela, Political Crisis, and 
Constitutional Reforms." He also said that participative 
democracy must be the main aspect of the amendments to ensure 
that people will have a say in the nation's important 
sociopolitical issues. He also rejected all doubts that the 
community will not be able to understand the amendments due to 
the large number of articles. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] People will not discuss the 
amendments article by article; they will merely reply yes or no, 
as is done in every democratic country. They will ratify or 
reject the amendments drafted by the National Congress. [end 
recording] 
  He also said that it is necessary to give the Venezuelan 
people a greater opportunity to participate and more power in 
view of the situation the country is currently experiencing.

  [Text] Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera has said the 
country's fiscal deficit is worsening mainly because of the 
crisis in the banking sector -- a crisis he says has prompted 
irregular, unjustifiable, and perverse pressure on Venezuelan 
currency to convert it to foreign currency, which is 
impoverishing our nation. 
  He said the state currently does not have a plethora of 
resources as it did in the past when resources were squandered 
and used to encourage physical and moral corruption. He said: 
"We do not have a great deal of money in our budget; instead, we 
have found a tremendous deficit that is getting worse for a 
thousand reasons." 
  Speaking at the Saturday inauguration of a newly built 
section of the Trapichito neighborhood in Valencia, President 
Caldera noted that although resources are scarce, there still 
exists a great deal of hope, desire, and a strong work ethic in 
the nation. He added that, through the joint efforts of various 
state offices that deal with public housing and slums, the 
nation will face these social problems, which it still considers 
a priority. 
  "I feel a special calling to resolve the housing and slum 
problems, and the government I head is committed to this and 
intends to struggle and open the way to clean up slums 
throughout the country and boost housing at every level in 
accordance with the economic needs of the dwellers," Caldera 
concluded.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Angel Montero 
Revette has said certain officers involved in the 1992 coup 
attempts will be promoted to the next rank on 5 July after the 
head of state approved the list proposed by the qualifying board 
and the four branches of the military institution. 
  [Reporter Vicente Briceno] Gen. Montero Revette has made the 
announcement from Miraflores Palace, disclosing the decision by 
the president with whom he met for approximately three hours to 
review the military promotions that will be submitted to 
Congress in the coming days. 
  Through the Senate's Committee of Defense, Congress will 
study the appropriate files. Montero has reported the approval 
of the following promotions: 30 brigade generals, 10 of which 
are in the Army, six in the Air Force, eight in the National 
Guard, and six Navy rear admirals. 
  Also up for promotion are 120 colonels, broken down as 
follows: 40 in the Army, 25 in the aviation division, 35 in the 
National Guard, and 20 ship of the line captains in the Navy. 
  As the minister explained, the promotions to the ranks of 
vice admirals and division general were left pending for next 
week because President Rafael Caldera was unable to review them. 
Montero has said that based on a decision by the president, a 
group of officers from the four branches who participated in the 
1992 coup attempts will also be promoted on that same date. 
  [Begin Montero recording] These officers, primarily from the 
Army, rejoined the force more than two years ago and are working 
in troop commands in different posts of the organization. They 
have the same rights and duties of other officers. For that 
reason, those entitled to a promotion are evaluated. He may or 
may not be promoted, but not due to the coup attempts, because 
that is over for us. [end recording] 
  [Briceno] The defense minister has added that, like the 
officers who participated in the 1992 coup attempts, the 
enlistees who joined them in these actions will also be 
promoted. President Caldera has dropped the charges against 
these soldiers. 
  Commenting on the return to the country of General Francisco 
Viconti, Montero has said President Caldera, as Armed Forces 
commander in chief, and the Defense Ministry have felt his 
return to military active duty is impossible; for that reason, 
he will be discharged.

  [Text] Caracas, 3 Feb (EFE) -- A day after his inauguration 
and following a military parade in his honor, Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera today was involved in a minor traffic 
accident as his vehicle was leaving the Plaza de los Proceres in 
Caracas. 
  According to eyewitnesses, a television cameraman, while 
filming Caldera's departure, approached a horse of the Honor 
Guard escorting the presidential car, spooking the animal and 
prompting it to rear. 
  According to sources close to the president, the president's 
chauffeur was forced to brake abruptly to avoid hitting the 
horse. In the mishap, Caldera received a blow so sharp that it 
broke his pen into three pieces. 
  The president, who complained about pain in his ribs, will 
be 
examined by doctors at the Miraflores Palace, seat of the 
Venezuelan Government.

<F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno and Aneris Gonzalez from "The News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] [Moreno] The economic cabinet of President Rafael 
Caldera today announced the general strategy or guidelines of 
the economic plan to be implemented over the next five years. 
One of the highlights is that Venezuelan Petroleum will give 10 
percent of its shares to its employees. Other major points 
include an emphasis on decentralization and private investments. 
Various sectors support the plan and think President Caldera is 
on the right track. Time will tell, however, and we have to wait 
and see how the economic plan proposed by the Caldera cabinet 
works. 
  [Gonzalez] It is worth mentioning that a large number of 
people from all sectors--namely, CTV [Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers], Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce 
and Services], and Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]--have 
gathered here at the Eurobuilding Hotel, as you can see your 
screen, to discuss and review the entire economic program. As 
you rightly pointed out, Ligia, the opening to private 
investment is one of the highlights of this strategy, and, in 
some way, it has grabbed the attention of all sectors of society.

  [Text] Members of the executive cabinet of President-elect 
Rafael Caldera will work in coordination in order to reactivate 
the country's productive apparatus. Here is a report on the 
plans of the new ministers, to whom we wish lots of success. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] First, we will 
interview Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. What are 
your first measures going to be? 
  [Burelli] Work. 
  [Reporter] What are your plans? 
  [Burelli] Reinforce or restore Venezuela's image abroad, 
which has recently deteriorated. 
  [Enzo del Buffalo, nominee for chief of the Central Office 
of 
Coordination and Planning of the Presidency] We will try to 
conduct profound reforms in the basic industries and oil 
sectors. We will try to complement those reforms with policies 
consonant with the current circumstances in order to stabilize 
the foreign exchange rate, control inflation, and reduce fiscal 
deficits through austerity measures already announced. 
  [Rafael Angel Montero Revette, nominee for defense minister] 
We will review the Armed Forces plans and above all, we will 
reactivate and improve the Armed Forces social welfare plan. 
This includes the areas of health and housing, so our soldiers 
can live and work under better conditions. 
  [Abdon Vivas Teran, nominee for president of the Venezuelan 
Investment Fund] We will strengthen the privatization process. 
We will try to promote it on the basis of solid, technical, 
conceptual, and at the same time participative plans. We 
believe that participation will serve to increase the state's 
efficiency, distribute wealth, and make the productive apparatus 
more efficient. 
  [Ciro Anez Fonseca, nominee for agriculture and livestock 
minister] My priorities will be based on the president's 
interest to encourage productive sectors, particularly the 
agricultural sector, which has suffered difficulties during the 
past few years which we hope to resolve in the near future. 
  [German Luis Soriano, nominee for tourism minister] One of 
the most important activities in the country's economic 
development in the next few years will be developing tourism as 
an activity that not only will create new jobs but will also 
help develop important regions in the country that have been 
neglected in the past. 
  [Juan Nepomuceno Garrido, nominee for labor minister] The 
social welfare plan must be defined by the president of the 
Republic. So far we have not.... [pauses] I know his opinion 
and he knows mine, we both know what the country's current 
situation is. You can be sure that President Caldera will have 
in me a faithful, loyal minister, who is willing to work, follow 
his policies, and lead the country to a path of well-being. 
  [Ruben Creixems, nominee for justice minister] What was not 
done in 20 years cannot be done overnight. We must, however, 
work hard to attain our goals. 
  [Julio Sosa, nominee for finance minister] I believe 
balancing the budget is fundamental to curbing inflation, or at 
least reducing it to an acceptable level. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] Judging from unofficial yet reliable information 
circulating yesterday among journalists at Miraflores Palace, 
Cesar Quintini Rosales, transportation and communications 
minister, will not be the only one to leave President Rafael 
Caldera's executive team. 
  Quintini will reportedly be joined by Development Minister 
Luis Carlos Palacios; Ciro Anez Fonseca, agriculture and 
livestock minister; and Roberto Perez Lecuna, environment and 
natural renewable resources minister 
  Development Minister Palacios has apparently followed the 
government's general guidelines in the commerce and industries 
sector, and certain people say the tendency will be to fall back 
and return to subsidies. Labor unions have criticized the 
minister, and it is believed that he is trying to absorb 
organizations like the Institute for Consumer Education and 
Protection (IDEC) and the Institute for Business Competition. 
  No one knows if the minister's problems stem from actions 
taken by his brother. Rumor has it that the minister's brother 
went to the Institute for Business Competition and demanded that 
the organization change its decision to prevent the merger of 
Heinz and Yukery "because he is the minister's brother." 
Environment Minister Perez Lecuna has been forced to face the 
critical problem created by the water shortage. The extended 
drought has spread a desperation among the people that has not 
been seen in many years. Nevertheless, there is no information 
on any errors or omissions on the minister's part that could 
serve as the basis for his removal. 
  As for the agriculture and livestock minister, organizations 
like Fedeagro [National Federation of Agricultural-Livestock 
Producers], Fedenaga [Venezuelan Cattlemen's Federation], and 
Fedenaca [Peasant Union] have demanded Ciro Anez Fonseca's 
removal, bitterly complaining about the minister's inability to 
act as a mediator to renegotiate the 143 billion bolivar debt in 
the agriculture sector and obtain a higher preferential rate to 
finance this year's harvest. 
  Cesar Quintini Rosales' problems in the Transportation and 
Communications Ministry are well known. They began with the 
resignation of deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who reported 
the existence of corrupt groups supported by high-ranking 
officials. Quintini is not alone. Rumor has it that he is 
supported by Hugo Perez La Salvia, a member of the commission 
conducting the investigation of Iribarren's charges, the results 
of which remain unknown. Journalists report that he was fired, 
but yesterday Quintini denied dismissing him.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has indicated that in 
Venezuela, there is a high demand for foreign exchange by 
speculators and that his government has been questioned for 
political rather than economic reasons. Caldera stated that an 
abnormal situation prevails in the country but added that his 
government will win the confidence battle. 
  Caldera emphasized the fact that there are currently two 
crises. One is the institutional crisis resulting from the 
trials of former Presidents Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andres 
Perez and the transitional government led by Jose Ramon 
Velasquez, which gave public employees a salary increase without 
enough available funds. The other is the economic crisis 
resulting from the intervention involving Banco Latino.

could impeach any government official, including the president, 
who fails to perform his duties. He made these statements at the 
opening of a play called "Venezuela, Political Crisis, and 
Constitutional Reforms." He also said that participative 
democracy must be the main aspect of the amendments to ensure 
that people will have a say in the nation's important 
sociopolitical issues. He also rejected all doubts that the 
community will not be able to understand the amendments due to 
the large number of articles. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] People will not discuss the 
amendments article by article; they will merely reply yes or no, 
as is done in every democratic country. They will ratify or 
reject the amendments drafted by the National Congress. [end 
recording] 
  He also said that it is necessary to give the Venezuelan 
people a greater opportunity to participate and more power in 
view of the situation the country is currently experiencing.

  [Text] Central Information Office Minister Guillermo

Orloge), adviser to the IMF, the United Nations, and the World

exchange rate for two months. 
  Alvarez said the expert's recommendation contradicts the 
economic policy of President Rafael Caldera as well as the 
economic policy of private economic organizations, such as the 
Higher Institute of Administration Studies, Iesa, and the 
Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, Venamcham. The adviser 
participated in the forum: "Post-Sosa Plan Alternatives for 
Venezuela," where he said that President Caldera should adopt 
these measures, otherwise, the crisis will deepen and [words

  [Begin recording] [Alvarez] That is the center of the

  [Alvarez, interrupting] No, quite the opposite; it disagrees 
with sectors of the private economy. 
  [Reporter] I meant the government's economic policy. 
  [Alvarez] The government's economic policy is absolutely 
independent from what Mr. [name indistinct], the IMF, Venamcham, 
and Iesa might say. Absolutely different. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] break from IMF? 
  [Alvarez] No, perhaps a break between the IMF and Iesa and 
Venamcham. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera agreed, during a meeting held at La 
Guzmania presidential residence, to increase bilateral 
cooperation and fully use consultation and political dialogue 
mechanisms. 
  The two presidents decided to create a high-level binational 
commission that will be chaired by their foreign ministers and 
comprised of the ministers in charge of bilateral cooperation 
issues. The presidents also agreed to hold the second meeting 
of the Venezuela-Brazil political consultation mechanism in our 
country. Furthermore, they issued instructions to authorities 
in the foreign trade sector to assess and step up the 
negotiations to reach an economic complementation agreement 
within the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
framework. 
  Even though no agreements were signed in the meeting, it 
helped establish the groundwork for common projects in different 
sectors. In the highway sector they agreed to finish highway 
BR-174 and to broaden a land transportation agreement. In the 
electric sector they reached an agreement for the purchase of 
Venezuelan energy. In the hydrographic sector the topic was 
navigability between the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. In the 
mining sector they will work jointly to protect Indians at the 
border area. In the ecology sector the issue was ecological 
tourism in a joint action to recover areas degraded by illegal 
miners. In the steel works sector the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron and 
Steel Works] furnaces will manufacture iron and manganese alloys. 
  Later, during a news conference, the Brazilian president 
said 
his government is carefully analyzing border problems with our 
country, adding that neither Venezuela nor Brazil should neglect 
looking into these issues because they might cause an atmosphere 
of uncertainty in the relations between the two nations. 
Moreover, President Rafael Caldera said that following the 
talks with his counterpart he is fully convinced the current 
Brazilian Government is clearly inclined to adopt the necessary 
measures to prevent illegal mining on Venezuelan territory. 
  [Begin recording] [Franco, in Portuguese] It is clear that 
the border problem between Brazil and Venezuela will be 
carefully analyzed. We have a very extensive border with 
Venezuela, a border that was abandoned by our peoples. Now with 
the presence of President Rafael Caldera and with the presence 
of the Brazilian Government, we will be able to study and 
carefully analyze those aspects which today cause problems in 
our relations. 
  [Caldera] I am fully convinced that the current Brazilian 
Government is clearly inclined to adopt all the measures 
possible to prevent the garimpeiros' [Brazilian gold seekers] 
illegal mining activities in Venezuela -- both by watching the 
border and by adopting precautionary measures in the State of 
Roraima and other border states where they may have their 
operations centers and by enforcing legal measures through 
Brazilian courts against those who have perpetrated illegal 
actions in this area. [end recording] 
  Referring to the first meeting held between the heads of 
state of Venezuela and Brazil, Gilberto [as heard] Poletto, 
minister of state and president of the Foreign Trade Institute, 
and Andres Velasquez, governor of Bolivar State, agreed that new 
roads have been opened to strengthen bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Poletto] There was talk about stepping up 
the negotiations to sign an economic cooperation agreement 
between Venezuela and Brazil because this had been discussed a 
couple of years ago. This will bolster the partial agreement we 
currently have, perhaps by adding more products and including 
some additional norms. The goal is to consolidate and improve 
trade relations between Venezuela and Brazil, which have 
recently increased but are still insufficient compared with the 
immense possibilities we have in different trade sectors. 
  [Velasquez] Specifically referring to the Brazilians' case, 
I have had the opportunity to discuss a specific proposal. All 
the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish 
with the Brazilian Government should include a specific 
agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe 
Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or 
logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the 
garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length 
because the latest information we have, based on investigations 
that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just 
involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as 
scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and 
the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug 
trafficking. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by General Fernando Ochoa Antich, Venezuela's </F>
former defense and foreign minister: "The Coup d'Etat"] 
  [Text] I read Hilarion Cardozo's statements with great 
interest, not only because of their striking content but because 
he has always accurately interpreted the Venezuelan military's 
thinking and feelings. His position is clear. He says there 
are three groups in the Armed Forces. The first one, described 
as conservative, will follow ideas similar to the ones endorsed 
by the 27 November coup leaders and which are close to economic 
right-wing groups. Another one is located, as far as I 
understand, in the organization's middle ranks and has 
progressive tendencies. It maintains contacts with radical 
groups in our political sector. A third group prefers to give 
the Caldera government the military strength to face the current 
crisis. Cardozo is right. Three groups exist and have existed 
in the Armed Forces since 1958. 
  We recall the initial efforts of Rodolfo Jose Cardenas, the 
right-wing trend of the conspiracy against Luis Herrera, and the 
first basis of military support for Romulo Betancourt when he 
decided to put a stop to leftist congressmen of the era 
following the Encanto train attack. I believe it is necessary to 
clairfy Cardozo's proposal. Two groups have always existed in 
the Armed Forces, united by a national feeling: one, a majority 
devoid of political passion, which carries out its professional 
military job, and the other, which thinks the Armed Forces is 
the path to power. 
  What Cardozo failed to explain in his statement is that the 
politically-influenced group requires sufficient social 
deterioration to convince the majority of the Armed Forces of 
the need for a coup d'etat. Without those special conditions 
existing in the country, a coup simply would fail and would not 
be more than a coffee shop conspiracy. President Caldera and 
his government have sufficient political experience to prevent 
the forming of support around the minority group that might 
stage such a coup d'etat. I am certain of that. What does 
concern me is the vast popular unrest that exists against the 
leadership sectors for maintaining excessive privileges and 
unbridled ambitions. We Venezuelans blame that leadership for 
the misguided administration of the country. Until 1970, we had 
faith in creating a modern, developed, and different society. 
Expectations ended in utter failure and frustration. That 
perception permeated the Armed Forces and was the cause of the 4 
February and 27 November coups. The prospect that Rafael 
Caldera would come to power, with all his moral authority and 
abilities, calmed the country during those historic moments and 
again created new confidence in the Armed Forces. That is the 
true origin of the existing institutional stability. 
  Certainly, Rafael Caldera must reestablish a national 
consensus to avert a coup d'etat. Hilarion Cardozo is clear on 
this, but he does not interpret or say this consensus can only 
be secured by achieving profound national change. That is the 
government's dilemma. If it does not face the existing 
political, financial, labor, and judicial state of affairs and 
continues with sweeping reforms, popular resentment will again 
infiltrate the Armed Forces' ranks, creating the climate for a 
coup d'etat -- hence the real fear of Hilarion Cardozo and 
traditional party leaderships. They know the first obligation 
of a politician, moreso if he is a chief of state, is to 
preserve power. What will Rafael Caldera do if he feels that 
the very basis of his government is threatened? Will he permit 
a climate for conspiracy or, on the other hand, will he prefer 
to lead the national resentment, conducting the big changes 
required by the country? Only time will tell.

newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has sworn in new directors 
for FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and 
the General Bank Superintendency--Norys Aguirre and Tesalio 
Cadenas, respectively. After they were sworn in, both officers 
ruled out controls on foreign exchange. They also said they 
intend to evaluate the assistance given to banks as well as the 
proposals made by Gustavo Roosen, special commissioner for 
financial reforms. 
  FOGADE Director Norys Aguirre stressed her institution's 
duty 
to restore confidence in the financial system, and she said that 
currently the state is the greatest FOGADE contributor. She 
referred to strategies by the leadership of FOGADE by announcing 
reforms to the law that created this fund. 
  [Begin Aguirre recording] Basically there are two 
strategies. 
One is the short-term strategy, and this is the immediate 
solution to the current banking crisis. The long-term strategy 
deals with reforms, and if these are needed I will be the first 
person to propose them, as I have done up to now, through 
Congress to the government, in due course. I am not afraid to 
make changes. If a complete FOGADE reorganization is needed, 
this will be done. [end recording] 
  For his part, Tesalio Cadenas admitted that the General Bank 
Superintendency had faults that failed to prevent greater 
control--in other words, stricter control--of the Venezuelan 
financial system.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has described 
the rumor mill as a criminal tactic to undermine the country's 
prestige abroad and the calm of citizens. He noted that the 
rumor mill has been active these past few days, and that even 
the health of President Rafael Caldera has been questioned. 
  Escovar Salom gave no information on the inquiry conducted 
on 
a destabilization plan that includes this chain of rumors but 
termed them sources of unrest that seek to crumble the public's 
support for the Caldera government. He insisted this thing about 
the bogeyman is no cliche, but rather a conspiracy that involves 
a manipulation of the public and in no way is related to social 
unhappiness or protests over the water shortage. 
  [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Some people have made the 
absurd assertion that I want to explain the social crisis by 
blaming the bogeyman. I never said that. You are the first to 
know that is not so. You clearly heard what I said. The social 
crisis, which the government acknowledges, the economic crisis, 
and severe difficulties the country is experiencing is one 
matter. The manipulation and tactics by some sectors that have 
an interest in heightening the crisis and seeking other goals is 
another matter. That is what these sectors are trying to do. The 
events that took place over the weekend are clear proof that my 
remarks were serious and justified. I mean the rumor campaign. 
This rumor mill is criminal. I mean all these announcements of 
the future of the bolivar, devaluation, and alleged financial 
and fiscal measures the government is purportedly going to take. 
[end recording] 
  Commenting on the resignation of some members of the 
cabinet, 
Escovar Salom said any decision on the matter falls solely 
within the purview of President Caldera. On another matter, the 
Interior Minister commented on the border dispute between Merida 
and Zulia States. He noted this problem must be handled with 
utmost caution and prudence.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (DPA) -- The administration of 
President Rafael Caldera will implement controls on prices and 
on the dollar exchange to cope with the severe financial and 
monetary crisis in Venezuela, congressmen from three political 
parties announced after meeting with the chief of state. 
  Spokespersons for the ruling National Convergence, the 
Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), and the opposition workers 
Radical Cause Party expressed their support today at Miraflores 
Palace for the government's "emergency" measures and requested 
tighter controls on the banking system. One-third of the 
country's banks ended up in state hands due to the liquidity 
crisis at nine institutions. 
  The opposition Social Christian Party, Copei, and the social 
democratic Democratic Action Party did not express their 
position on the new official measures of Caldera, who began his 
second government term on 2 February. The 78-year-old president 
will address the country on a television network tonight to 
announce the new measures. 
  As a reflection of the severe situation, the dollar has 
jumped from 117 bolivares (national currency) in late April to 
200 last Thursday. The government has availed itself of a 
prolonged banking holiday that began on Friday to draft the new 
measures. 
  According to commentators, the Venezuelan state provided 
assistance "without sufficient guarantees" to new banks in 
crisis on the order of $4 billion. This "financial crack" began 
last January with the intervention at Banco Latino, until that 
time considered the country's second most important bank. The 
state intervened at eight other banks two weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace for the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] The situation recently provoked by the abrupt 
increase in the dollar's price, from 118 to 127 bolivares, 
prompted a meeting between President Rafael Caldera; Jose Bouza 
Izquierdo, chairman of the National Banking Council; and Berend 
Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms; as well as Andres 
Caldera, minister of the Presidency Secretariat, and Ciro Anez 
Fonseca, minister of agriculture and livestock. 
  The well-known banker attributed Friday's decrease in the 
rhythm of the devaluation, from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, to 
actions that were coordinated by the Central Bank of Venezuela 
and private banks. This has managed to positively control the 
dollar's exchange rate which has prevailed since last week. 
  [Begin Bouza Izquierdo recording] Nothing new or different 
is 
happening. The government has just ratified one more time that a 
foreign exchange control or a maxi-devaluation are not part of 
our current plans. I believe this is enough to believe we do not 
have to rush out and buy foreign currency with anguish, under 
pressure, or with nervousness. In fact, this only pushes the 
price upward and people who go to the parallel market will pay 
amounts that far exceed the foreign currency's real value. The 
banks are within the limitations that are characteristic of the 
operations we carry out, supplying the foreign currency that the 
Central Bank of Venezuela passes on to us. Our actions are 
within an absolutely regular scheme. I do not think we should 
feel concerned or nervous. That will only worsen the situation.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera said yesterday that 
summoning a constituent assembly is not the solution to the 
country's problems. He also urged the Congress to include the 
impeachment referendum in the constitutional amendments to 
create a "truly participative" democracy. 
  The president noted Colombia's positive experience in this 
area, adding that it is possible to reform the system "without 
breaking the constitutional thread." 
  Speaking during the presentation of the book Venezuela, 
Crisis and Constitutional Reform at the Avila Hotel, he 
said he was among those who think the congressional debate on 
the reform should begin where the past legislature left off. In 
any case, a bicameral commission should be named to promptly 
update the study and to include new proposals. Caldera indicated 
four kinds of referenda must be included in the reforms: a 
referendum to impeach, a referendum to consult, a referendum to 
approve, and a referendum to confirm. As an example, he said a 
matter as important as the delimitation of marine and underwater 
areas with Colombia must be submitted to a popular consultation, 
"because a mere ratification by Congress would not be 
sufficient." 
  Regarding federalism, Caldera explained he views it as the 
adequate strengthening of administrative decentralization that 
avoids "the destructive abuses" of centralism but does not 
restore the vices of the old system of cronyism. 
  "I have been asked, not without malice, if now as president 
I 
continue supporting the possibility of revoking the mandate of 
the head of state and any top official, and I have said I would 
feel bad if it were not approved," he warned. The president said 
he is confident that the congressional debates will have a 
favorable outcome and that the stumbling blocks to a favorable 
outcome will be removed.

President-elect Rafael Caldera, Gonzalo Garcia Bustillos, the

between Caracas and Havana are excellent and friendly. 
  In statement to journalists, Garcia Bustillos said president 
Caldera's Government is willing to maintain friendly relations 
with Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos also expressed his rejection of the 
economic 
blockade the United States has maintained against Cuba for three 
decades, and he said measures of this sort should not be 
implemented at this time. 
  Garcia Bustillos recalled that President-elect Caldera views 
the theory of social justice as the basis for international 
relations, and he said this theory should go into effect in 
today's international community. 
  Garcia Bustillos favored Cuba's reintegration into the OAS 
as 
part of the family comprising all of the states in the 
continent, and discussed the situation and the recent economic 
measures implemented in Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos said he met with President-elect Caldera to 
exchange general views regarding foreign policy.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (AFP) -- Today in Caracas, political 
analysts highlighted the news that President Rafael Caldera's 
administration, which will be four months in power on 2 June, 
faces its first crisis due to ministerial disagreement over the 
course of economic policies. 
  Government sources confirmed today the resignations of 
Planning (Cordiplan) Minister Enzo del Bufalo and Transport and 
Communications Minister Cesar Quintini, and said Caldera is 
expected to announce his new cabinet by Monday [30 May] at the 
latest. 
  According to political observers, Del Bufalo's departure is 
due to his "conceptual differences" with government economic 
proposals. Quintini was accused of "not touching the Perez 
corruption structures (referring to jailed former president 
Carlos Andres Perez) that rule the ministry," by his former 
deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who resigned. Others who will 
leave their posts are the ministers for urban development and 
environment and natural renewable resources. 
  Central Information Office Chief Guillermo Alvarez Bajares 
justified the change of ministers arguing that this is not a 
single party administration and its heterogeneity makes 
differences understandable. Alvarez denied that the removal of 
ministers proves the failure of certain policies and he pointed 
out that the president has the power to modify and restructure 
his council of ministers at any moment. 
  The current cabinet, made up of 26 ministers, the federal 
district government, and the head of the Presidential Committee 
to Reform the State, had been restructured by Caldera on 31 
January, two days before becoming president.

<F P=106> [Interview with Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera by </F>
an unidentified reporter at the Supreme Court of Justice in 
Caracas; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Caldera] I understand that the budget is something 
that is quite important; nevertheless, it is not something that 
has priority status. There are other issues that are above 
financial considerations. 
  [Reporter] Do you then believe it is something related to 
moral values? 
  [Caldera] Fundamentally, all of the problems we are 
experiencing in the country originate from the moral crisis we 
have been confronting. 
  [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed within the 
judicial branch, what are the initiatives you have proposed? 
  [Caldera] [words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed in the 
judicial 
branch, could you explain what your proposals will be? 
  [Caldera] Well, at this point in time it would be impossible 
to explain all of the reforms that have been proposed. It would 
be necessary to first start by reforming the Constitution. A 
general constitutional reform entails several proposals which, 
by the way, would include recommendations by Supreme Court Vice 
President Alirio Abreu Burelli -- recommendations similar to 
those made last year by Magistrate Josefina Calcano de Temeltas 
in an address in which she proposed the creation of a 
constitutional court. 
  In addition, there are numerous other opinions that include 
reforming the Constitution, laws, and related administrative 
orders. These proposals are currently being received favorably 
because of something that is quite true, and that is this: All 
Venezuelans are convinced that we are facing a very difficult 
situation. The next administration and government will face a 
very complicated situation, but it is necessary for us to begin 
now, because the moment is fundamental if we expect to reach the 
21st century under the best conditions for democracy. 
  [Reporter] In terms of the value-added tax [VAT], at this 
time there are eight annulment appeals that... 
  [Caldera, interrupting] There you go, dragging me into the 
VAT again! 
  [Reporter] Of course, this the issue the people are most 
interested in. 
  [Caldera] That is alright; it really does not matter. My 
position with respect to the VAT is quite clear. Now, I would 
not like to venture and express a judicial opinion at this time 
and place. Of course, out of respect for the Supreme Court of 
Justice, I am forced as a private citizen to... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President, right now there are 
eight annulment appeals to repeal this bill. What can you say 
about this? 
  [Caldera] I can only say that this issue must be decided as 
quickly as the previous appeals were resolved. 
  [Reporter] What are your final proposals? 
  [Caldera] I am committed to struggling to eliminate the VAT 
in a way that will also reform the tax system, establish a tax 
on those groups that are living in better conditions and can 
afford to pay, and not increase the tax burden on the less 
privileged sectors. 
  [Reporter] Anyway, in your opinion, what actions should 
be... 
  [Caldera, interrupting] That is enough for now.

statement when he participated in the inauguration of the day of 
reflection on constitutional reforms held at the Catholic 
University amphitheater. 
  Caldera indicated that measures have been taken on the 
alleged destabilization plan by the corresponding intelligence 
corps and an investigation has been opened on the case. With 
regard to the constitutional reforms, the president said that 
although this is not the solution to the nation's problems it is 
a condition for making the major changes the nation awaits.

  [Text] For President Ramon J. Velasquez, as well as for 
President-elect Rafael Caldera, the imposition of price controls 
on family basket products comes in response to a public plea. 
The fixing of prices on 10 family basket products via price 
controls does not imply, in President Ramon J. Velasquez's 
opinion, that a step backward will be taken in the process of 
modernizing our economy. This measure is an attempt to halt 
speculation. 
  Meanwhile, on this same subject, President-elect Rafael 
Caldera said the measure should be temporary, and he explained 
that in his government taxes will have to be paid. 
Nevertheless, the idea is to get those who have more to pay 
more and not for those who have less to pay more. 
  Asdrubal Batista, economic adviser to Caldera, also 
commented 
on the VAT and price control issues. For Batista, the VAT is 
part of a tax system that unfortunately lacks fairness, and, 
therefore, in his opinion, the whole tax system should be 
totally reformed. 
  Here is what President Velasquez said: 
  [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Speculation has become 
widespread and therefore it is the government's duty, as 
indicated by law, to take steps necessary to protect the 
consumers -- in other words, the majority of the people. In the 
coming months, a number of reforms will have to be passed by 
parliament. It is not that we will be taking a step backward in 
the economy's modernization process. No, not at all -- no one 
is thinking such a thing. Venezuela cannot step backward, 
because those conditions of fiscal abundance in which everything 
was subsidized and everything was protected was a situation of 
false harmony that no longer exists. Unfortunately, this 
situation no longer exists. [video cuts to interview with 
President-elect Rafael Caldera] 
  [Caldera] We want those who can pay more to pay more, while 
not placing a heavy burden on those who have less and, in turn, 
can pay less. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that this can be done? 
  [Caldera] There is apparently willingness to implement the 
measures necessary to save the fiscal deficit and to orient the 
nation's economy. This economy should not be inflationary in 
order to allow the necessary stability to develop. [video cuts 
to interview with Caldera adviser Asdrubal Batista] 
  [Batista] It is regretful that currently those who have less 
are paying more proportionately than those who have more. This 
is what economists call a (?regressive tax) -- that is, an 
implicit imbalance in the direct tax collection system. This 
situation must be corrected, otherwise problems will occur over 
and over again. In short, accounts cannot be paid, expenses 
cannot be met, public services deteriorate completely, and the 
people feel general dissatisfaction because the state is not 
meeting its commitments. There is a law of dimension, and I 
think it is as follows: The state must allocate funds for its 
expenditures, and at the same time these disbursements must be 
permanently and cleanly financed through taxes paid by the 
community. [end recording] 
  All concurred that it is the next parliament that must 
assess 
the extent of the changes the nation has experienced and take 
appropriate action.

  [Text] Caracas, 25 May (AFP) -- A tax on luxury items 
(between 10 percent and 30 percent) and wholesale transactions 
(10 percent); a new tax code; reforms to the income tax; and a 
new fiscal stamp law were approved on Wednesday by President 
Rafael Caldera's administration, it was officially reported in 
Caracas. 
  The approval of these taxes and laws complete the package of 
new fiscal mechanisms proposed by Caldera. Part of these 
mechanisms had been approved earlier -- a tax on bank debits 
(0.75 percent) and new laws for the concession of public works 
and for a budget. 
  Caldera received special powers from Congress approximately 
one month ago for the implementation of this series of taxes and 
tax laws. The powers are valid through today and they authorize 
him to issue a decree approving these laws instead of submitting 
them for parliamentary discussions. 
  Upon reporting the approval of these new taxes, with which 
the government expects to overcome this year's fiscal gap -- 
calculated at approximately $6 billion -- Finance Minister Julio 
Sosa said the Venezuelan economy is leaning toward 
stabilization. Sosa also said that the currency could be 
revalued in about two weeks. The bolivar, whose exchange rate 
has dropped considerably for a month, has been devalued 30.93 
percent, and its parity with the dollar is currently 182 
bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa said that parity could rise to 
150 bolivares in approximately 15 days.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- Today, the Venezuelan 
Government announced a series of changes in President Rafael 
Caldera's cabinet. These changes are designed to improve 
coherence in the government team. According to Guillermo 
Alvarez, chief of the Central Information Office, the new 
development minister will be Alberto Poletto, president of the 
Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. Poletto will continue to be 
president of the ICE, and in the future, this office will become 
the ministry of industry and commerce. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the current development minister, will 
head the Central Office of Coordination and Planning. Palacios 
will replace Enzo del Bufalo who, according to the press, 
resigned because of serious differences with the other members 
of the economic cabinet. 
  Ciro Zaa, currently minister of urban development, has been 
appointed transport and communications minister. Zaa replaces 
Cesar Quintini who was accused of not being willing to attack 
the corruption spotted in the department by former Deputy 
Transport and Communications Minister Rafael Iribarren. 
  Francisco Gonzalez, currently president of the Urban 
Development Fund, will replace Ciro Zaa as the new minister of 
urban development. The Urban Development Fund will shortly come 
under the Urban Development Ministry. 
  One of the changes that surprised all the local political 
observers took place in the Venezuelan Investment Fund, 
responsible for the privatization process. Abdon Vivas Teran, 
head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has been replaced by 
Carlos Bernardez, a former president of the Bank of Venezuela, 
the oldest private bank in Venezuela. 
  The chief of the Central Information Office also announced 
that Alfredo Gruber will be the new president of the Venezuelan 
Guayana Corporation, the most powerful state-run business group. 
Gruber will replace Francisco Layrisse who, a few days ago, 
announced that he wishes to return to private practice. 
  The latest addition to the cabinet, announced today, has 
been 
the appointment of Pompeyo Marquez, currently a minister without 
portfolio, as coordinator for the government's social programs. 
The new members of the cabinet will be sworn in on Monday [30 
May] and will start to work immediately, Alvarez said.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Committee of the Social Christian Party 
[COPEI] today analyzed the cabinet changes made over the weekend 
by President Rafael Caldera. The COPEI leadership believes the 
country's problems will not be solved with simple cabinet 
changes. 
  The National Committee's conclusion was announced by Acting 
Deputy Secretary General Freddy Delgado Dalo who said that it is 
necessary to establish a coherent policy. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] The National Committee believes 
that simple cabinet changes, in this case by rooking [enroque], 
will not solve the country's problems. The country is demanding 
the definition of policies and coherence in government policies, 
not the substitution of some men for others. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Segundo Melendez, leader of the Movement Toward 
Socialism [MAS], said that these changes are appropriate. 
  [Begin Melendez recording] As you know, we expressed our 
views on this last week. The decision made by the president is 
aimed at something we believe to be essential, and that is the 
need to create coherence and unity in the economic cabinet. This 
is very important for conducting the overall economic policy. 
[end recording] 
  Democratic Action Party leader Pedro Tabata Guzman has said 
that it is necessary to see how effective these changes really 
were. 
  [Begin Tabata recording] With this rooking move made by the 
president, all he did was create expectations. For some time now 
we have been saying that there was much incoherence among those 
who formed President Caldera's economic cabinet. I believe we 
must now wait to see if things change. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Radical Cause Party believes that the changes 
have been appropriate. This was announced by party leader Pablo 
Medina. 
  [Begin Medina recording] Some appointments seem to be 
appropriate. We believe that naming Pompeyo Marquez as head of 
the government's social programs is quite appropriate. Also 
appropriate is the appointment of Ciro Zaa as transportation and 
communications minister since the former minister's actions had 
been questioned by former Deputy Minister Rafael Iribarren. 
However, in general terms, we do believe the bankers have 
greater control of this cabinet. The fact that Julio Sosa 
remains as finance minister, that Carlos Bernardez was appointed 
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, and that Gustavo 
Roosen remains in an overly privileged position, indicates that 
the country's bankers have made progress in controlling the 
cabinet. Despite this, some of the changes made do seem 
appropriate. [end recording] 
  However, National Convergence believes that the growing 
number of bankers in the cabinet has a clear purpose. This was 
said by National Convergence Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui. 
  [Begin Uzcategui recording] There is a financial crisis, and 
the least that can be done is to reinforce the financial sector. 
If there is need to create an environment of trust in our 
economy and the future of our currency, then appointing 
experienced men, successful men--these men have not failed in 
their profession--is positive. Therefore, I do believe it is a 
positive move to create this image of credibility. All of them 
have been involved in banking activities with substantial and 
excellent banks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Josefina Blanco] </F>
  [Text] A warm afternoon and a superb view of Mount Avila 
greeted Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. A UH-214 
Army helicopter took the Portuguese premier and his entourage 
from the Maiquetia Airport to the General Francisco de Miranda 
Air Base in La Carlota. The group included Foreign Minister 
Jose Durao Barroso, Commerce and Tourism Minister Fernando Faria 
de Oliveira, and Luis Sousa de Macedo, secretary of state for 
Portuguese communities. 
  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera received the 
distinguished party with words that recalled the long and close 
relations between both countries and the beneficial presence of 
the large Portuguese community in Venezuela: "....the Portuguese 
presence in Venezuela has without doubt proved to be very 
positive," the Venezuelan president said. Both leaders met at 
the recent Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, at the beginning of this week. 
  The Venezuelan reception committee included Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli, Tourism Minister Herman Luis Soriano, and 
Armed Forces Commander Otto Garcia. 
  Upon his arrival, Cavaco Silva, who is 54 years old, has a 
degree in finance, is a professor and member of the Social 
Democratic party (PSD), and is visiting this country for the 
first time, highlighted the importance of his four-day mission 
in Venezuela. He comes, he said, to strengthen the existing 
political, cultural, economic, and business relations between 
both countries. The head of the Portuguese nation said he was 
accompanied by 50 of the most important and significant 
businessmen in his country. 
  Cavaco Silva also said that he visited the country as a 
member of the European Union (EU) and that the talks would thus 
cover the strengthening of relations between the EU and the 
Latin American countries, taking into account the fact that 
Venezuela has played an important role in furthering integration 
in the region. 
  Cavaco Silva's presence in Venezuela will seal three 
cooperation agreements between both countries. One is a two-way 
investment and protection agreement, another will cover the 
prevention, control, and surveillance of drug use, and the third 
is for technical cooperation in several fields such as 
agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and maritime transportation.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>
  [Text] I am very concerned about the situation created by 
the implementation of the IVA on the general public. I am 
especially concerned about the exorbitant speculation that has 
been unleashed in the country, largely due to a lack of 
information and control. 
  President-elect Rafael Caldera thus argued his opposition to 
the IVA in the light of the court decision forcing the 
government to suspend its implementation. 
  Caldera said: "I clearly informed President Velasquez' 
administration" of the impoverishing effects the IVA would have 
on the people. 
  President Velasquez feels committed and forced to maintain 
the IVA because he views it as a pledge he made at the time of 
his election. As a concession, he agreed to an exemption in a 
number of fundamental areas such as food, medical treatment, 
medicine, and travel. 
  According to Caldera, these exemptions were agreed upon with 
the promise to increase taxes on luxury items. However, he 
believes it might be better to adopt a position more like that 
of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. The tax should be 
imposed more heavily on sectors that are better able to pay, 
which would at least partially reduce the fiscal deficit. 
  The president-elect returned to the issue of speculation to 
point out the current government's "apparent powerlessness" in 
dealing with it. In view of this situation, he said, the events 
and reasons that led to the court decision were "obvious. 
Everyone acknowledges them." 
  Caldera said: I am not prepared at this moment to issue a 
legal opinion concerning the origins, background, and 
consequences of this measure, which is quite new in Venezuela's 
legal history. I would prefer to express an opinion after 
gaining a clearer view of this matter. 
  Caldera announced that following the installation of the 
legislature he will introduce a "complete and full proposal to 
reform the tax system." The idea is to put the burden on those 
who can really pay the tax.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from the Miraflores Presidential </F>
Palace in Caracas; from "The News" newscast] 
  [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez and President-elect 
Rafael Caldera, have said there are no plans to control the 
exchange rate of the Venezuelan currency. The two appealed for 
calm and for preventing a flight of foreign exchange because 
this would not help the situation, on the contrary, it would 
worsen it. They insisted that common sense will determine the 
dollar exchange rate. 
  The two agreed that the measures announced last night by 
President Velasquez will be maintained and there will be 
continuity. President-elect Rafael Caldera has reiterated his 
support for the announcements made by President Velasquez. 
  [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Banking policies will be 
conserved, first because they are the product of lengthy 
analyses in which bank authorities and bankers have 
participated; they are the product of experience; and they are 
the result of the banking sector's decision to respond 
positively to the Venezuelan situation. 
  [Calderas] The measures that have been announced have my 
support and that of all Venezuelans because the financial 
situation is important for all of us. In that declaration there 
are very important points. It not only lists the current 
government's commitments that will be inherited by the 
government over which I will preside, but also lists the banking 
sector's commitment making it obligatory for the presidents of 
the country's largest banks to maintain a healthy financial 
system and a system deserving of the Venezuelan people's trust. 
[end recording] 
  The president-elect reported his government's firm decision 
to back judicial rulings because although he has nothing against 
anybody, he believes the country wants the implementation of 
severe measures to prevent a repeat of past events. 
  The Banco Latino intervention board was sworn in this 
afternoon at the Presidential Palace. Finance Minister Carlos 
Silva introduced to the media the three members of the board 
noting that the three have much banking experience. 
  [Begin recording] [Silva] We trust they will objectively 
evaluate that bank and adopt the necessary measures. 
  [Board President Jose Santo Domingo] Regarding our future 
plans [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The scheduled 28 January reopening 
of 
the bank could be modified now that you have been sworn in as 
bank interveners? 
  [Santo Domingo] I think that date will stay. Yes. The 
Deposit Guarantee Fund will supply funds necessary to pay 
accounts having a balance under 100,000 bolivares. [end 
recording]

Cuban biotechnology products to Venezuela, as well as the need 
to intensify the struggle against the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  Lage also met with several Venezuelan businessmen and will 
travel early tomorrow to Colombia. 
  [In the same cast, Rebelde adds that during his trip to 
Caracas, Lage reiterated Cuba's interest in promoting Latin 
American investments in Cuba, which is taking measures to adapt 
its economy to global conditions. Lage met with Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and other officials. 
Lage added that Cuba is opening to foreign capitals, preferably 
in Latin America, with which it hopes to strengthen political 
ties and move toward integration. Lage stressed that Cuba does 
not want to become capitalist, just to adapt to the global 
situation and perfect the socialist model.]
