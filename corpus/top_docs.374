<HEAD>Panel Hands Agent Orange Decision Back to Derwinski</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some Vietnam veterans
exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski is expected to make the decision around Thanksgiving
as the result of court-ordered regulations for determining the
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer.
   Nearly 12,000 disability claims once denied by the VA are now
pending as a result of a court order issued in May by U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco.
   Derwinski was looking for the Environmental Hazards Advisory
Committee, made up largely of scientists, to clear up some of the
arguments over Agent Orange.
   But the panel, in its first ruling on Agent Orange, acknowledged
Friday that it couldn't come up with a definite conclusion. The
committee said it ``does not find the evidence sufficient at the
present time to conclude that there is a significant statistical
association between exposure to (Agent Orange) and non-Hodgkins
lymphoma.''
   They added they ``cannot rule out such an association.''
   Veterans' groups blame Agent Orange for cancers that have turned
up years later in former soldiers who were exposed when the United
States used it to clear jungle area in Vietnam during the war.
   Veterans say their non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma
and other forms of cancer were caused by the defoliant.
   The government has long said that cancers cannot be definitively
linked to Agent Orange. No studies have been undertaken looking at
veterans who were exposed to the chemical because government
scientists contend they cannot create such a sample.
   In his ruling in May, Henderson said the VA had used criteria
more stringent than Congress intended in a 1984 law that ordered
benefits to veterans exposed to the herbicide.
   The VA has said the new regulations give Derwinski the freedom
to give veterans the benefit of the doubt absent any strong
recommendation by the committee, made up largely of scientists.
   The committee will meet in late January to address studies
covering Agent Orange exposure and soft tissue sarcomas as well as
porphyria cutanea tarda, an ailment that produces chronic skin
lesions. Those are the other two ailments addressed in Henderson's
court ruling.
   Several of Derwinski's actions have been interpreted as signs
that he wants to take action, if only limited, in favor of
veterans. Those include his decision not to appeal the May ruling,
his appointment of retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as a special
adviser and his statements that he will give veterans the benefit
of the doubt.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during the war, and a
son who served in Vietnam died of a cancer believed linked to
exposure.
   The American Legion, which has accused the panel of bias,
criticized Friday's statement.
   ``They spent entirely too much time on crossing the t's and
dotting the i's,'' said Richard S. Christian, a deputy director of
the American Legion.
   The main suspect in Agent Orange is the contaminant dioxin, a
byproduct of industrial processes known to be an extremely potent
carcinogen in laboratory animals. Its effects on humans are less
well documented.
   Of the roughly 230,000 veterans who have told VA they were
exposed to Agent Orange, 635 have documented cases of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, the VA says.
   There are 35,000 veterans seeking benefits for problems linked
to Agent Orange exposure.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Backs Compensation for Vets With Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>

   Vietnam veterans who suffered cancer and other
diseases after exposure to Agent Orange should receive disability
payments, says a government adviser who had ordered spraying of the
herbicide.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. told a Department of Veterans
Affairs advisory panel that he believed 27 cases of illness, mostly
cancers, could be sufficiently linked to Agent Orange exposure to
justify compensation.
   Zumwalt spoke to the Environmental Hazards Advisory Committee as
its newest member and as a personal adviser to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski Jr.
   The committee on Wednesday began reviewing scientific evidence
on the health effects of Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt speaks from a unique perspective: as commander of naval
forces in Vietnam, he ordered the spraying of the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide, which was used to deny jungle cover
to the enemy.
   In addition, Zumwalt's son, who served in Vietnam, died of a
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure, and a grandson has birth
defects linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt urged the panel to take a fresh look at the scientific
evidence on Agent Orange. He also said a study he conducted for
Derwinski parallels the work of an independent group of scientists
hired by three veterans' groups.
   That group, the Agent Orange Task Force, said this month there
was enough evidence to justify compensation for eight diseases or
ailments that have been linked to exposure. The panel said there
were 13 other health problems, mostly cancers, for which there is
sound evidence of connection but not yet enough evidence to justify
compensation.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' Zumwalt said. He contended the VA panel lcked a
systematic approach or epidemiological perspective.
   Zumwalt went further, saying he believes 27 ailments, mostly
cancers, could be compensated using VA criteria that were adopted
as the result of a court order last year.
   The main diseases cited by the task force, Zumwalt and others
are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, soft tissue sarcoma,
chloracne and other skin disorders, liver disorders, a metabolic
disorder known as porphyria cutanea tarda and birth defects.
   Zumwalt's list includes 13 kinds of cancer in addition to those
already cited.
   The VA has said it will come up with final rules this year on
compensation. Derwinski must make the decision based on the
recommendations of the 15-member advisory committee, a panel of
scientists and lay people.
   The VA decided in March to award compensation for 1,800 Vietnam
veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on a
Centers for Disease Control study that found an increased risk of
the disease among Vietnam veterans as a whole. The study was
inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   About 36,000 claimants have been denied compensation despite
their contention that Agent Orange exposure caused their health
problems. About 240,000 say they have been exposed to the herbicide.
   The Zumwalt statement heartened congressional Vietnam-era
veterans who have pushed for legislation to award compensation.
   ``The evidence is there,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``The
only question left is whether or not the federal government is
willing to accept its responsibility.''

   Three kinds of cancer and five other diseases
among Vietnam veterans can be traced to exposure to the defoliant
Agent Orange, according to a scientific report released Tuesday by
veterans groups.
   The report, released on the eve of a congressional hearing on a
bill to pay benefits to Agent Orange victims, produced no new
evidence. Rather, it reviewed existing studies.
   Lawmakers pushing the benefits praised the study by the Agent
Orange Task Force, seven scientists assembled by the American
Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Veterans Legal
Services Program.
   ``It is not only appropriate but it is scientifically correct''
to award compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed to the
dioxin-containing defoliant, said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a
Vietnam veteran and sponsor of Senate legislation to award
compensation.
   The report said proof exists of a ``significant statistical
association'' between herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma; soft-tissue sarcoma; chloracne and other skin disorders;
early liver disease; and porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic
disorder.
   The scientists also said there was enough evidence to give the
benefit of the doubt in awarding compensation to veterans who were
exposed and suffer from Hodgkin's disease, neurologic and
reproductive problems and developmental problems with their
offspring.
   They say there's limited evidence of an association between
exposure and a large number of cancers, as well as immunological
abnormalities and psychological problems.
   A Senate bill has been passed and a House bill introduced to
provide benefits to veterans who claim their diseases were a result
of exposure. The bills differ in cost _ $36 million for the Senate
version and $89 million for the House version _ length of coverage
and number of diseases covered.
   A Veterans Affairs subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony
Wednesday on the House bill sponsored by Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a
co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress.
   Both bills would create an independent panel of scientists under
the auspices of the independent National Academy of Sciences to
review herbicide studies. Critics say the government has
intentionally tried to influence the evidence on Agent Orange to
avoid paying benefits.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski has decided to award benefits
to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma sufferers who served in Vietnam. That
decision was made March 29 as the result of a study by the Centers
for Disease Control.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure and a variety of ailments. Only a handful _ those
for chloracne _ have been granted.
   About 240,000 veterans believe they may have been exposed to the
herbicide and have requested physical examinations, VA says. A
total of 12 million gallons of Agent Orange was sprayed during the
war to remove ground cover and crops.
   Agent Orange is a phenoxyacetic herbicide contaminated with
dioxin during manufacture. Dioxin is the main disease-causing
suspect.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen.''
   The scientists on the panel say an influential private study of
Nitro, W.Va., Monsanto workers exposed to dioxin has been
discredited because of allegations of scientific fraud. So has an
important study of industrial workers in Ludwigshafen, West
Germany, they said.
   The scientists were especially critical of the VA and CDC for
ignoring animal studies, especially because agencies such as the
EPA gives them such strong consideration.
   VA scientists say the animal dioxin studies are less reliable
because of the variety of reactions from species to species, and
because there is documented human exposure, said VA spokeswoman
Donna St. John.
   The two bills cover only a few of the ailments: non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and chloracne. The House
version adds melanoma and basal cell carcinoma.
   Oliver Meadows, the chairman of the VA's outside Environmental
Hazards Advisory Committee, dismissed criticism in the new report
that it ignored a large number of studies and that it used a
``simplistic tallying system'' to weigh data.
   The panel has only examined the connection between Agent Orange
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The new report covers all the possible
ailments.
   The panel found in November that an association cannot be proved
or disproved. The VA panel meets later this month to consider other
cancer studies.
   The CDC study of six kinds kinds of cancer found an increased
risk of only one _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma _ among Vietnam veterans.
It found no such increase in soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's
disease, and nasal, nasopharyngeal and primary liver cancer.
   The study looked only indirectly at Agent Orange exposure.

   A Vietnam-era commander who advises the
Veterans Affairs Department on Agent Orange said Wednesday veterans
should be compensated for 27 cancers or other afflictions he says
were linked to the herbicide.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.'s assessment came at the
opening of two days of hearings by a VA advisory committee on
health effects related to herbicide exposure.
   The panel's conclusions will help determine whether the VA will
award service-connected disability payments to Vietnam veterans
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated herbicide.
   The department has already decided to award compensation for one
related cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on
a congressionally mandated study of cancer among Vietnam veterans.
The study, however, was inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt was commander of naval forces in Vietnam, and ordered
that the herbicide be sprayed. His son, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, was a
patrol boat commander at the time and died two years ago at age 42
of cancer purportedly linked to exposure. A grandson suffers from a
birth defect also purportedly linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt has recently been an adviser to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski and is a member of the VA's advisory Committee
on Environmental Hazards.
   He said his conclusions closely paralleled those of a group of
independent scientists retained by the American Legion, Vietnam
Veterans of America and the National Veterans Legal Services
Project.
   That group said earlier this month the VA's advisory Committee
on Environmental Hazards ignored a large body of data. The
scientists said they found evidence to compensate veterans for
eight ailments or diseases, and evidence to consider compensating
for 13 others.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' Zumwalt said.
   Zumwalt said compensation could be justified for 27 afflictions,
including soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne and other skin disorders,
liver disease, Hodgkin's disease, neurologic defects, birth
defects, leukemia and 13 other cancers.
   Derwinski was still reviewing the private report from Zumwalt
and could not comment on it, said spokeswoman Donna St. John.
   The government and veterans advocates have been at odds for
nearly a dozen years over the link between Agent Orange and various
diseases. The government Centers for Disease Control has concluded
that there is no way to determine which veterans have been exposed.
   Some 12 million gallons of the herbicide was sprayed between
1965 and 1970. The herbicide was contaminated during manufacture
with dioxin, regarded by the Environmental Protection Agency as a
probable human carcinogen.
   More than 36,000 veterans have been denied claims as a result of
the impasse. Derwinski, in deciding not to appeal a court case a
year ago, paved the way for the issue to be reconsidered.
   In another development dealing with Agent Orange, the Internal
Revenue Service said it has declared non-taxable the payments to
veterans from a fund established in 1984 by herbicide manufacturers
as a result of a lawsuit. Some 60,000 servicemen who served in
Vietnam from 1961 through 1972 or their survivors are eligible for
payments.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes VA's Refusal to Compensate Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>

   A report to Veterans Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski sharply criticizes the government for its longstanding
refusal to compensate Vietnam veterans for illnesses linked to
Agent Orange exposure.
   The report by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. was released the same
day an advisory panel to the Department of Veterans Affairs paved
the way for compensation to Vietnam veterans suffering from a rare
cancer known as soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Derwinski is expected to decide in late May or early June
whether to award compensation for that form of cancer.
   ``I hope this is the beginning of the end of the nightmare Agent
Orange victims have suffered,'' said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle,
D-S.D., a co-chair of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress caucus.
   The VA Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards made its
recommendation Thursday after reviewing scientific studies on the
connection between dioxin and herbicide exposure to soft tissue
sarcoma.
   Zumwalt, one of four lay members of the 15-member panel,
criticized the committee Wednesday for its previous handling of the
Agent Orange question. The panel was created by Congress in 1984 to
investigate the link between exposure and a host of ailments,
largely cancers, that Vietnam veterans have been complaining about
since the 1970s.
   A federal court order last year, which Derwinski declined to
appeal, forced the panel to begin its work anew. Although the last
Agent Orange was sprayed in 1971, the VA has awarded only a handful
of Agent Orange claims, and those were all for a skin condition
called chloracne.
   Derwinski decided in March that all Vietnam veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be compensated.
   The American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America and outside
scientists commissioned by the two groups have long criticized the
government's refusal to acknowledge health hazards associated with
Agent Orange. The herbicide was contaminated with dioxin, labeled a
``probable human carcinogen'' by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   On Thursday, the VA released a report that Zumwalt compiled for
Derwinski.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, flawed methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' Zumwalt wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for specifically analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to
Agent Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not
outright governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to
Vietnam veterans associated with exposure to dioxin,'' he wrote.
   Zumwalt referred to the federal Centers for Disease Control,
given responsibility by Congress for conducting Agent Orange
studies because of ``evidence of VA's footdragging.''
   Zumwalt repeated allegations raised in a congressional hearing
last summer that CDC sabotaged its Agent Orange study, suggesting
``that political pressures once again interfered with the kind of
professional, unbiased review Congress had sought to obtain.''
   Compensation for Agent Orange will cost nearly $90 million for
only a few of the ailments linked to the herbicide, the
Congressional Budget Office says.
   CDC has maintained it cannot establish who among Vietnam
veterans was exposed to Agent Orange, making further study
impossible.
   Zumwalt said his own review of the scientific evidence suggests
28 ailments, mostly cancers, can be linked to Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt, commander of naval forces in Vietnam, ordered the
spraying of the defoliant in Vietnam and lost a son, a Vietnam
veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt has
said he nonetheless would have ordered the spraying because it
ultimately saved more lives than it cost.
   Zumwalt said the herbicide was used in undiluted form to remove
enemy cover, destroy enemy crops and clear vegetation around
military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and trails.
   He said more was sprayed than records indicate, because of
unofficial uses of the herbicide.

<TEXT>
   A former commander who ordered the spraying of
Agent Orange in Vietnam says veterans aren't the only ones to
suffer from the government's refusal to recognize the herbicide's
trail of cancer and birth defects.
   Testifying Tuesday before a House Government Operations
subcommittee, retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. said the
government's attitude casts doubt on how honestly it is dealing
with dioxin exposure in the environment.
   Agent Orange, used in highly concentrated form to remove crops
and enemy cover, was contaminated during its manufacture with
dioxin, an unwanted byproduct that the Environmental Protection
Agency considers to be a probable cause of cancer.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control, however, says it cannot
study the health effects of Agent Orange exposure on veterans
because it is impossible to determine reliably who was exposed when
jungles were sprayed to deprive enemy troops of cover.
   Veterans groups contend that military records can match spraying
activities with troop movements. Agent Orange
   Zumwalt, who commanded naval forces in Vietnam, reported to
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski in May that the
government and industry ``intentionally manipulated or withheld
compelling information on the adverse health effects'' associated
with exposure to the ingredients of Agent Orange.
   Key among those ingredients is dioxin, although scientists at
Tuesday's hearing said other contaminants may also be blamed for
cancers, birth defects and other afflictions.
   ``... The flawed scientific studies and manipulated conclusions
are not only unduly denying justice to Vietnam veterans suffering
from exposure to Agent Orange, they are now standing in the way of
a full disclosure to the American people of the likely health
effects of exposure to toxic dioxins,'' said Zumwalt.
   He reiterated charges by outside scientists that two influential
industry-sponsored studies on plant accidents used fraudulent data,
and that scientists refuse to use animal data clearly showing a
connection between dioxin exposure and disease.
   ``While dioxin apologists concede dioxin's carcinogenic effects
on animals, they insist that humanity has a miraculous dispensation
from the harmful effects dioxin wreaks on other species of the
animal kingdom,'' he said.
   Derwinski retained Zumwalt last fall as an unpaid adviser to
help resolve the Agent Orange question, which has been debated for
two decades.
   Since Derwinski took over last year as head of the Veterans
Affairs Department, compensation to veterans has begun.
   Without stating outright that Agent Orange exposure was the
cause, the VA has decided to compensate the few thousand veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcomas, both rare
forms of cancer.
   Zumwalt said in his report May 5 to Derwinski that based on his
review of scientific literature, those two cancers and 25 other
afflictions should be considered to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski chose Zumwalt because of his unique position. As a
commander, he ordered the herbicide to be used. Among those serving
in Vietnam at the time were Zumwalt's son Elmo, who later died of
Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Other witnesses said Tuesday that more attention needs to be
focused on both key ingredients of Agent Orange, not just the one,
2,4,5-T, that was contaminated with dioxin.
   They said the other ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and
other ailments linked to Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D
was also contaminated with harmful compounds, some related to
dioxin, they said.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   The farm-chemical industry believes further research into 2,4-D
is needed, but the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it exists at all, industry
spokesman Garry Hamlin said in a telephone interview from
Indianapolis.

<HEAD>VA to Pay Vietnam Veterans for Soft Tissue Sarcoma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration has decided to
allow disability payments to Vietnam veterans with soft-tissue
sarcoma, a rare form of cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski announced the action
Friday, the second time this year the VA has decided to award
compensation for cancers linked to exposure to the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide that was sprayed in undiluted form
during the Vietnam War.
   On March 29, Derwinski announced that veterans suffering from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would be eligible for compensation.
   Friday's decision was based on the recommendations made by the
VA's Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards, a panel
of outside scientists and lay people. It found Thursday that there
is ``at least as likely as not'' a significant statistical
association between the disease and exposure to Agent Orange.
   The ruling in March was based on a study by the Centers for
Disease Control study of selected cancers. Researchers found a 50
percent increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among Vietnam
veterans, but the study looked only indirectly at whether Agent
Orange was the cause.
   The CDC study found no such increased risk for soft-tissue
sarcoma. But the advisory committee's examination of other
scientific literature relating to herbicide and dioxin exposure
tilted the balance in favor of compensation.
   ``I believe this is another step forward in resolving a most
difficult and emotional issue,'' Derwinski said. ``We intend to
proceed as quickly as possible to award compensation to these
veterans who are so deserving of our care and concern.''
   For years, Veterans have been seeking compensation for diseases
they say were caused by Agent Orange, a combination of two phenoxy
herbicides, one of which was contaminated with the byproduct dioxin.
   As many as 28 health problems, mostly cancers, can be associated
with exposure, according to Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a special
adviser to Derwinski.
   VA plans to publish its final compensation regulation for
soft-tissue sarcomas in early fall. An estimated 1,100 veterans or
their survivors are expected to receive compensation for
soft-tissue sarcomas to start with. An additional 50 claims
annually are expected thereafter, given the long latency period for
cancer.
   Soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors found on
muscles and connective tissue or in body fat.

<TEXT>
   More Agent Orange was sprayed in Vietnam than
official records show, a former commander said in a report Thursday
that also suggests ``a discernible pattern, if not collaboration,''
to deny veterans compensation.
   Also, a Veterans Affairs Department panel issued a ruling that
brings compensation closer to veterans exposed to the herbicide who
suffer from soft-tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer.
   Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., in his report to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski, said he was certain from his experience that
more Agent Orange was spread than recorded.
   ``Combat units ... frequently conducted `unofficial' sprayings
of Agent Orange obtained from out of channel, and thus unrecorded
sources.'' said Zumwalt.
   ``Additionally, as commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Vietnam, I was
aware that Agent Orange issued to Allied forces was frequently used
on unrecorded missions,'' Zumwalt said in the report.
   The report, issued May 6, was released Thursday, a day after
Zumwalt told an advisory panel to the VA he believes that 28
diseases are linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt, a special
adviser to Derwinski, was recently named to the department's
Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards.
   The panel on Thursday determined it is as likely as not that a
significant association exists between soft-tissue sarcoma and
Agent Orange exposure.
   Derwinski is to decide by June whether to award disability
payments to veterans with that disease. Derwinski decided in March
that all Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be
compensated.
   The advisory committee in August will examine studies relating
dioxin and herbicide exposure to a skin disease known as chloracne,
and a metabolic disorder known as porphyrea cutanea tarda.
   The two reports make it likely that veterans will be compensated
for soft-tissue sarcoma. VA spokesman Bonner Day said the
department had no figure on how many Agent Orange claimants said
they have soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Zumwalt's report said the herbicide was used in strengths far in
excess of that suggested by the manufacturers. The makers have
settled a class-action lawsuit brought by afflicted veterans.
   He also criticizes government actions and studies on Agent
Orange, including the activities of the advisory panel.
   His broadsides backed up claims by veterans who have been trying
to get compensation for more than a decade and who claim the
government has had to be pushed to move and has ignored evidence
supporting links between Agent Orange and cancers.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, faulty methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' Zumwalt wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for ... analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to Agent
Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not outright
governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to Vietnam
veterans for disabilities associated with exposure to dioxin.''
   Committee chairman Oliver Meadows said he would not comment on
the Zumwalt report.
   Zumwalt ordered the spraying of the defoliant in Vietnam and
lost a son, a Vietnam veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange
exposure.
   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide, which contained
cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed from 1965 to 1970, according to
records.
   Zumwalt said, however, ``a significant, if not major source of
exposure was from non-recorded, non-Ranch Hand operations.'' Ranch
Hand was the name for the aircraft spraying operation.
   ``Evidence readily suggests that at the time experts knew that
Agent Orange was harmful to military personnel,'' he said.
   Zumwalt said that in addition to removing enemy cover and
destroying crops, the herbicide was sprayed to clear vegetation
around military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and
trails.

   The decision by the Veterans Affairs
Department to award compensation to Vietnam veterans suffering from
one rare form of cancer doesn't resolve the dispute over exposure
to Agent Orange.
   The decision, announced Thursday, could make it possible for the
VA to close the doors to compensation for a host of ailments linked
to the herbicide used in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970 to deny jungle
cover to the enemy.
   Based on a study released the same day by the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta, VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
said he would award 100 percent disability payments to any Vietnam
veteran suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Payments would be retroactive, and widows and children would
receive survivors' benefits as well. More than 1,800 veterans or
their survivors could receive compensation as a result, according
to VA data, at a cost of $23 million the first year and about $25
million in subsequent years.
   Veterans advocates were pleased with the immediate decision but
remained skeptical about the study's application to the larger
Agent Orange questions. The government has insisted there is no
scientific proof of a link between the herbicide and a host of
ailments, mostly cancers.
   ``When the study was designed, CDC admitted that the study
population was significantly diluted with unexposed veterans, that
it lacked a meaningful measure of exposure and that it lacked the
statistical power to detect anything less than a 100 percent
increase in certain cancers,'' said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle.
   Daschle, D-S.D., is co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in
Congress Caucus and wrote legislation to make the disease and
others suspected of having a link with Agent Orange exposure
service-connected.
   The CDC ``Selected Cancers Study'' looked at the occurrence of
cancer in all Vietnam veterans in relation to men who did not serve
in Vietnam. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the only cancer found in the
study to have had an unusually high incidence.
   Derwinski was initially very careful to say his decision was not
an Agent Orange decision, but he and his aides were fuzzier in
later remarks.
   Derwinski at one point said he made his determination based at
least in part on the work of a VA-commissioned panel of outside
scientists. That group reported last November that it could not
find, but neither could it rule out, a statistically significant
association between Agent Orange exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   As a result of that finding, Derwinski had said he would
postpone a decision on Agent Orange compensation until after the
CDC study. He had planned, however, to wait for the advisory
panel's recommendation in May.
   Derwinski jumped the gun Thursday, but he insisted the panel
would continue its work on the Agent Orange issue. Derwinski is
also consulting with Elmo Zumwalt, the retired admiral who ordered
Agent Orange spraying and whose son died of a cancer linked to
exposure.
   Some 36,000 Agent Orange claims have been made for the lymphoma
and other ailments have been made, and almost all have been
rejected. About 230,000 veterans have asserted they have been
exposed to Agent Orange.
   The CDC study left some questions unresolved. It noted, for
example, that Navy veterans were more inclined to get the disease
even though they were least likely to have been exposed to Agent
Orange. It also said the lowest incidence was among veterans of III
Corps, the area of highest Agent Orange use.
   John Hanson, an American Legion official, said the study
neglected to point out that the III Corps area included Saigon,
which wasn't sprayed.
   Deputy Veterans Secretary Anthony J. Principi said VA was making
the presumption that any veteran who served in Vietnam was exposed
to Agent Orange. But Hanson said such a determination dilutes any
statistical sample to the point where an Agent Orange determination
is impossible.

   Farmers and homeowners frequently use
weedkillers that contain a key ingredient of Agent Orange that may
be more harmful than previously thought, scientists told a
congressional panel Tuesday.
   ``It appears to me that there are other contaminants in
herbicides, as well as herbicides per se, which have not been
adequately evaluated for carcinogenicity in animals let alone
studied for their effect ... in humans,'' Daniel Thau Teitelbaum, a
Denver physician, told a House Government Operations subcommittee.
   Teitelbaum studied industry records as part of the class-action
lawsuit by Vietnam veterans against the makers of Agent Orange.
   In the 20 years of controversy surrounding whether the
government should pay benefits to ailing Vietnam veterans who were
exposed to Agent Orange, attention has focused on dioxin
contamination 2,4,5-T _ one of the herbicide's two key ingredients.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen'' and 2,4,5-T has been out of
circulation for years.
   But scientists told the subcommittee that the other key
ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and other ailments linked to
Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D was also contaminated with
harmful compounds, some related to dioxin, according to testimony
on the government handling of Agent Orange research.
   The farm-chemical industry says ongoing research into 2,4-D is
needed but that the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it does indeed exist, industry
spokesman Garry Hamlin said in a telephone interview from
Indianapolis.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   Teitelbaum, noting that use of 2,4,5-T was first discontinued
because of concern about birth defects, said studies were needed on
possible birth defects resulting from 2,4-D exposure.
   Two National Cancer Institute studies have shown an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a rare cancer, in ``frequent users
of agriculture chemicals,'' said NCI researcher Shelia Hoar Zahm.
   The studies of farm workers in Kansas and Nebraska found that
the risk grows or drops according to skin exposure and how soon
after exposure the worker changed clothes.
   Vietnam veterans were exposed to Agent Orange in concentrations
far in excess of the normal strength, special adviser Elmo R.
Zumwalt Jr. has told the Veterans Affairs Department.
   The department said this year it would compensate veterans for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for another rare cancer _ soft tissue
sarcoma. However, the government maintains that exposure can't be
documented.
   Zumwalt, a retired admiral, ordered Agent Orange sprayed in
Vietnam to clear dense jungle. His son, who served in Vietnam,
later died of cancer, which Zumwalt attributes to Agent Orange. he
said 27 ailments can be linked to Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt, appearing before the subcommittee on human resources
and intergovernmental relations, reiterated his contention that
government and industry officials ``intentionally manipulated or
withheld compelling information on the adverse health effects
associated with exposure to the toxic contaminants contained in
Agent Orange.''
   In a related matter, Rep. Ted R. Weiss, D-N.Y., said his
subcommittee had forced the Air Force to release a 4-year-old draft
report showing an increase of birth defects among the offspring of
those who handled and sprayed Agent Orange from the air.
   Patti Turner, a spokeswoman for the Air Force Surgeon General's
office, said the conclusions were premature.

<HEAD>Veterans' Administration to Reconsider Agent Orange Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory committee to the Department of
Veterans Affairs this week may open the door a crack to disability
benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Responding to a federal court decision in May, the 15-member
Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards will look
again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to
clear dense foliage that hid the enemy.
   This time, however, the committee will use standards considered
less strict than those used for determining other service-connected
disabilities.
   No one is predicting the outcome. But there is agreement that VA
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski wants to resolve the issue quickly
and in favor of veterans.
   ``I don't think he's going to fool around very long,'' VA
spokesman Don Smith said. ``He's so far exhibited a degree of
willingness _ if not impatience _ to go along rather rapidly with
this.''
   Once the committee does its work Derwinski is ``kind of on his
own as to how he wants to fly on this,'' Smith said. He said
Derwinski will make a final determination on the committee's
recommendations within two weeks of receiving results of the
meeting.
   According to one congressional source, Derwinski's actions mean
``he's almost promised people'' that he will take some positive
action for veterans.
   Veterans blame exposure to Agent Orange for cancers, skin
diseases and genetic damage leading to miscarriages or birth
defects. The committee will spend its first two days reviewing
about 20 or 30 studies on the connection between exposure and
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, one of the most frequently cited cancers,
then study other diseases at later meetings.
   On Friday, it will issue recommendations on non-Hodgkins
lymphoma and Agent Orange.
   The four-year-old advisory committee and government scientists
have thus far rejected a link between Agent Orange exposure and
health problems other than a skin condition known as chloracne.
   The American Legion, the prime veterans' group in this dispute,
contends the committee has a longstanding bias against veterans.
   Not so, says Oliver Meadows, the disabled veteran and scientific
layman in charge of the panel. ``Their greatest interest is their
own integrity as scientists,'' he said.
   The government says the main problem with studies up to now is
that there has been no way to verify exposure to dioxin. The
American Legion and others say the government has detailed records
on spraying activities that can be combined with equally detailed
records on troop movements.
   Agent Orange, an orange-brown liquid that was shipped in
orange-striped barrels, was sprayed in Vietnam from January 1965 to
April 1970. More than 230,000 veterans have registered with VA
claiming to have been exposed. More than 36,000 veterans have filed
for disability benefits claiming Agent Orange exposure caused their
problems, and two have been granted compensation _ for chloracne.
   Agent Orange is suspect because it contains ``phenoxy''
herbicides associated with certain cancers as well as dioxin, which
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   Dioxin's links to human health problems are disputed, although
its links to human birth defects are more firmly established.
   A ruling in May by U.S. District Judge Thelton E. Henderson in
San Francisco created a way out of the impasse over Agent Orange. A
new administration and the elevation of the Veterans'
Administration to cabinet status added another ingredient.
   Henderson ruled May 2 that the VA imposed an ``impermissibly
demanding test'' for linking Agent Orange with health problems.
   Although the VA has relied on a ``cause and effect''
relationship in determining service-connected disabilities, the
committee was to use a different standard: ``a significant
statistical association.''
   Derwinski told Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh on May 8
that he had decided against an appeal.
   New regulations for reviewing studies using the new standard,
effective Wednesday, say a link will be deemed to exist if the
studies associating Agent Orange with health problems outweigh the
evidence that there is no association.
   The regulations say the VA secretary can give the ``benefit of
the doubt to the conclusion that the association exists.''
   In early October, Derwinski named Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as a
special adviser with a specific emphasis on Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during Vietnam, and he
lost a son who served in Vietnam to a cancer linked with that
spraying. Zumwalt is known as a veterans' advocate on this issue.

   The dispute over compensating Vietnam veterans
for a host of cancers and other ailments believed to be linked to
Agent Orange exposure is back in federal court.
   In a lawsuit filed here Thursday, two veterans groups asked that
federal scientists be forced to complete a study on the health
effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and their children.
   The suit said the Reagan administration ordered the study
canceled in 1987, four years after it began, because of concerns
that civilian claims against government and industry would follow a
decision to compensate veterans.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by the American
Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, five individual veterans and
four surviving spouses.
   It said that without the study, mandated by Congress in 1979, it
is impossible to persuade the Veterans Affairs Department to award
disability and death payments to thousands of veterans who were
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated defoliant.
   The herbicide, used to destroy ground cover and crops, has been
blamed by veterans groups for 19 cancers and a variety of other
health problems, including birth defects.
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers: soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   The soft-tissue sarcoma decision was based on the
recommendations of an advisory panel acting under a court order to
reconsider the scientific evidence. The lymphoma decision was based
on a Centers for Disease Control study of Vietnam veterans that
only indirectly looked at Agent Orange exposure.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said the lawsuit will set
back his effort to resolve the Agent Orange dispute. He began that
effort shortly after he took office by deciding not to appeal a May
1989 federal court ruling that VA standards on Agent Orange
disability claims were too strict.
   The ruling in San Francisco came as a result of a lawsuit filed
by the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``Now, these organizations have acted to return to the courtroom
with litigation aimed at forcing the scientific conclusions they
want,'' Derwinski said. ``Their suit impugns the integrity of
respected scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control whose
work thus far has added much to what we know about the health of
Vietnam veterans.''
   The CDC, in canceling the study, said there was no
scientifically valid way to document who was exposed. The American
Legion and independent scientists say records of troop movements
can be matched with spraying records to find the likely exposed
veterans.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs opened the
door Wednesday to independent scrutinity of its effort to determine
whether there is a link between exposure to Agent Orange and a
variety of diseases.
   The offer follows years of challenges to the credibility of the
VA, Centers for Disease Control and the Defense Department. Critics
have charged the government with ignoring the scientific evidence
of a connection between exposure and cancers and other diseases.
   The offer came during testimony by VA Deputy Secretary Anthony
J. Principi before a House Veterans Affairs subcommittee.
   Principi told the subcommittee on compensation, pension and
insurance that the department would agree to a review by the
National Academy of Sciences, to having its own panel of outside
scientific advisers enlarged, or to subjecting its work to outside
review.
   Two Agent Orange compensation bills pending in Congress call for
establishment of a scientific review procedure through the National
Academy, an independent group of scientists that advises the
government.
   ``Should Congress conclude that the process would be lent
credibility by our consulting with additional outside experts ...
we would be pleased to do so if that kind of consultation would not
unduly delay our progress,'' Principi said.
   But Principi also asked the subcommittee to put off
consideration of a compensation bill. The bill would award
service-connected disability payments to Vietnam War veterans who
contend they suffer due to exposure from one of four kinds of
cancer or from a skin disease known as chloracne.
   The bill would also pave the way to compensation for other
ailments as the evidence comes in.
   Principi asked that the law be held in abeyance until the VA
comes up with final regulations Oct. 1 on who should be compensated
and for what diseases. Those regulations depend in part on the
recommendations of VA's Advisory Committee on Environmental
Hazards, a 15-member panel of scientists and lay persons.
   The committee meets later this month.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski has appointed his
personal adviser on the Agent Orange issue, retired Adm. Elmo
Zumwalt, to fill a vacancy on the committee. Zumwalt ordered
spraying of Agent Orange during Vietnam and also lost a son who
served in Vietnam to cancer.
   ``We have, I believe, more than demonstrated our good faith,''
Principi said, saying the VA set its course a year ago when it
decided against appealing a federal judge's order that it draft new
Agent Orange regulations.
   But the House sponsor of the compensation bill, Rep. Lane Evans,
D-Ill., suggested the VA was trying to further postpone delivering
benefits to veterans. There is no guarantee the department will
decide to award compensation in its final rules.
   ``I think you are proceeding on a good-faith basis, but I
believe the veterans who suffer from Agent Orange can't wait,'' he
said.
   Evans' bill would compensate exposed veterans who suffer from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma, and basal
cell carcinoma, as well as chloracne. The measure is expected to
cost $89 million a year.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure to Agent Orange and a host of ailments. Only a
handful of benefits have been granted, for those suffering
chloracne.
   Dioxin, labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as a
``probable human carcinogen,'' is suspected as the primary but not
the only ingredient causing ailments among veterans exposed to
Agent Orange.

   Government scientists are expected to release
a study this week that will help determine officially whether
Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange
suffered cancers and other ailments as a result.
   The study by the federal Centers for Disease Control, which the
Veterans Affairs Department says will be released Thursday,
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among Vietnam vets.
It is another step in a 12-year battle to gain benefits for
veterans who blame cancers, skin disease and miscarriages in their
spouses on the powerful foliage killer.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski last November said he would put
off a determination on whether to award benefits until after the
study was completed. Following its release, the study must be
reviewed by a VA advisory committee of outside scientists.
   Derwinski will make a determination at the end of May after the
committee meets, VA spokesman Don Smith said last week. Final rules
should be in place in October. The decision also could influence
legislation in the House and Senate requiring compensation to
veterans.
   Derwinski said in a recent interview that the decision on Agent
Orange will be the most difficult he's made since becoming the
first VA secretary a year ago.
   ``The advice is so terribly conflicting,'' he said. ``There's no
consensus out there.''
   Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed citing Agent Orange as a
cause of disabilities. An additional 230,000 veterans have told VA
they were exposed to the herbicide, which contained highly toxic
dioxin and other suspected harmful ingredients.
   The new Selected Cancers Study by the CDC in Atlanta does not
look at whether veterans were exposed to Agent Orange, which was
sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops.
   According to the VA, the new study will determine whether
Vietnam veterans are at higher risk of developing soft-tissue
sarcoma, lymphoma and nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer. The
study began in 1985.
   CDC spokesman Chuck Fallis said he could not confirm that the
study would be released Thursday, the day given by the VA and the
American Legion.
   VA says the study can be combined with other studies, mostly
dealing with the exposure of industrial and farm workers to dioxin,
to tilt the balance one way or the other regarding a possible
connection to disorders.
   The Legion, however, is telling veterans not to hold their
breaths.
   ``The government has ducked the issue of Agent Orange for more
than a dozen years,'' National Commander Miles S. Epling said. ``We
are tired of waiting for more studies, especially irrelevant ones.''
   The Legion contends the CDC scuttled an earlier attempt at a
study by saying no reliable sample of veterans can be found. The
Legion says CDC has ignored detailed military records of troop
movements and spraying activities that could produce such a study
group.
   A Legion study claims to have established a connection between
Agent Orange and skin rashes and blisters, fatty tissue tumors,
hypersensitivity of the eyes to light, and an increased risk of
miscarriages among spouses. The Legion says the study was too
limited to reach further conclusions regarding other cancers.
   VA says scientific advisers to Congress and the administration
have rejected the Legion study because it relied on questionnaires
filled out by the veterans themselves.
   The Agent Orange issue was revived last May when U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson said VA had used too rigid a standard _
cause and effect between exposure and disease _ in evaluating Agent
Orange studies.
   Derwinski decided not to appeal Henderson's order that the VA
need only find a ``significant statistical association'' between
exposure and disease before determining to award compensation.
   The VA's outside Environmental Hazards Advisory Committee met in
November to review about 30 studies dealing with herbicide exposure
and its relation to non-Hodgkins lymphoma using the new criteria.
   The group said it could neither find nor rule out a significant
statistical association, giving little guidance to Derwinski.
   Derwinski said afterward he would wait for the new CDC study. He
cited remarks by members of the committee that such a study would
be useful.

   A long-awaited government study of cancer among
Vietnam veterans found no evidence linking the disease with
exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, officials said Thursday.
   The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which looked
only indirectly at Agent Orange, did find veterans at increased
risk of a relatively rare cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But
researchers noted the risk was greater among veterans who served on
ships than those who served on land, where the herbicide was used.
   In Washington, Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski quickly
said he would order the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay
disability compensation to vets suffering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   The study was immediately attacked by veterans groups, which
complained it failed to sufficiently examine the cancer risks among
the thousands of soldiers who actually worked with the dangerous
herbicide during the war.
   ``It is not an Agent Orange study,'' objected Mary R. Stout,
president of the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``This is only a look at Vietnam veterans'' who had cancer,
added John Hansen, spokesman for the American Legion.
   And Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era
Veterans in Congress Caucus, said: ``This action has been a long
time coming. However, it is not the final word. We cannot forget
the many other veterans who are also suffering and dying from Agent
Orange-related diseases and who have just as much evidence
supporting their claims.''
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the U.S. military to remove jungle
cover and crops in Vietnam, contained dioxin, a highly toxic
chemical which some studies have found to increase cancer risks.
   Criticism of the study focused on its methods, which involved
comparing cancer patients of Vietnam-veteran age to healthy
counterparts.
   The study ``only indirectly evaluated'' Agent Orange exposure,
because of the technical difficulties in determining two decades
later how much a patient may have been exposed to the herbicide,
the CDC said.
   Specific analysis of dioxin exposure was impractical, partly
because researchers don't know how cancer may skew the results of
blood tests for dioxin levels, said Dr. Daniel A. Hoffman,
assistant director for science at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   ``Our study was designed to look at Vietnam experience and
history, and secondly to ascertain the likelihood of exposure,''
Hoffman said.
   The study, conducted over five years, surveyed 2,067 cancer
patients who were of approximate Vietnam service age _ between 15
and 39 in 1968, at the height of U.S. troop involvement. They were
compared to 1,776 men of similar age who had no history of cancer.
   Both groups were studied for risk of six kinds of cancer,
including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group of
cancers that the CDC concedes has been ``of great concern among
Vietnam veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to have a roughly 50 percent increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said CDC Director William
L. Roper.
   That conclusion, the CDC said, came in part because the cancer
risk among Vietnam veterans ``seemed to be the opposite of the
pattern for use of Agent Orange.''
   Vets from the Navy's ocean ships had somewhat higher cancer
risks than those who served on land. And veterans from the region
of heaviest Agent Orange use were at ``somewhat lower risk'' than
others, the CDC said.
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men 35-59, the age group of most Vietnam vets.
The risk for Vietnam vets overall is about 1.5 per 10,000, Roper
said.
   The risk nearly doubled _ 90 percent higher _ for Navy veterans
stationed on ocean ships.
   The 50 percent higher risk is what epidemiologists call ``a weak
association,'' Hoffman said: It is statistically significant, but
``anything less than a twofold increase can sometimes be caused by
other factors.''
   The CDC found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The VA had been awaiting the study before deciding whether to
award benefits to vets exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000
claims have been filed citing the chemical as a cause of
disabilities including cancer, skin disease and miscarriages by
soldiers' wives.
   In announcing the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma benefits, Derwinski
mentioned only the link between Vietnam service and the lymphoma.
He didn't say the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   Payments, which would be retroactive, are expected to cost $23
million the first year and $25 million a year in succeeding years,
VA officials said. Based on the study, the VA estimated 1,800
veterans are due compensation, and there will be 450 new cases each
year.
   The complaints before the VA aren't the only ones about Agent
Orange. A class-action lawsuit against the seven manufacturers of
Agent Orange was settled in 1984 in U.S. District Court in New
York, and payments began last year.
   The court has estimated that 30,000 veterans and 18,000 survivor
families would be eligible for benefits from a settlement fund of
at least $240 million.
   The settlement's court-appointed administrator, Washington
attorney Kenneth Feinberg, had yet to see the CDC study and
couldn't say what effect, if any, it might have on the case, his
office said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Department of Veterans Affairs for the
first time acknowledged a link between cancer and exposure to
Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War, and
announced it will pay disability benefits to Vietnam veterans
with soft-tissue sarcomas.
   In March, the VA said it would grant disability benefits
to Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, another rare
cancer. It was the first time the government recognized a
connection between cancer and service in Southeast Asia. That
conclusion was based on a Centers for Disease Control study
that found a correlation between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
service in Vietnam.

   But the CDC study didn't find any connection betwen
exposure to Agent Orange and cancer. Veterans groups have
long contended that exposure to Agent Orange has led to a
higher incidence of cancer among Vietnam veterans, and in its
ruling Friday, the VA department conceded that there may be
such a connection.
   The latest decision rejects part of the CDC study, which
didn't find a link between service in Vietnam and five other
cancers, including soft-tissue sarcomas. But a VA advisory
committee reviewed scientific literature on the connection
between soft-tissue sarcomas and exposure to herbicides
containing dioxin and recommended that cancers be considered
service-connected and eligible for benefits.
   The ruling by VA Secretary Edward Derwinski means that
approximately 1,100 veterans or their survivors will qualify
for compensation. The department estimates it will recognize
an additional 50 new claims a year for soft-tissue sarcomas,
which are difficult-to-diagnose tumors found on muscles and
connective tissue or in body fat. The VA projects it will pay
about $8 million a year as a result of the decision.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking
another look at the cases of all Vietnam veterans whose benefits
claims due to exposure to Agent Orange were denied, and easing the
standards for receiving compensation.
   The change became known Thursday when VA Secretary Edward
Derwinski said the government will not appeal a federal judge's
decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting
compensation for victims of Agent Orange.
   Derwinski's decision was seen as a major step toward disability
benefits for some of the more than 34,000 veterans of the Vietnam
War who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems.
   Derwinski said the VA will follow the judge's instructions to
review all previously denied claims and use new, statistical
standards to decide whether specific diseases are presumed to have
been caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``It's a very significant step,'' said Mary Stout, president of
the Vietnam Veterans of America, a 35,000-member group that filed
suit over the VA's denial of benefits in Agent Orange cases. ``I
think it does show that there's a new Veterans Administration and a
new administration that's taking a different view of the Agent
Orange situation.''
   Agent Orange was widely sprayed by U.S. forces in Vietnam as a
defoliant. Its medical effects years and decades later on the
soldiers who handled it or were exposed to it have been the subject
of intense legal and scientific debate.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ruled this week in San
Francisco the VA had used an ``impermissibly demanding test'' in
requiring proof of a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure
to Agent Orange and specific diseases.
   Instead, he said, the agency should require only a finding of a
statistically significant correlation or ``increased risk of
incidence'' _ a less difficult standard to meet.
   Derwinski, a veteran and former member of Congress, said he had
begun ``a good hard look'' at the department's Agent Orange policy
even before the federal judge's ruling. He said he concluded it was
not good policy and ``frankly not good politics'' to fight the
ruling.
   VA officials said the department will direct its 11-member
scientific committee that reviews Agent Orange issues to take a new
look at all scientific and medical studies of Agent Orange using
the new statistical standard.
   Derwinski said he expected final decisions on the diseases by
October.
   Deputy Secretary Anthony Principi said the VA would consider any
veteran who served in Vietnam to have been exposed to Agent Orange
and would not require specific proof they were in an area where the
herbicide was sprayed.
   The department, which until this year was known as the Veterans
Administration, has consistently held that only one disease, a skin
condition known as chloracne, was caused by exposure to Agent
Orange during military service.
   As a result the VA has denied disability compensation for
veterans who claimed exposure to other diseases, including cancer.
The VA has provided medical treatment for those conditions, however.
   Whether those cancers and other illnesses can be linked
statistically to Agent Orange exposure has been a matter of
dispute. Derwinski's decision puts that question before the VA's
panel of scientists and other experts, which had concluded there
was no scientific link based on the previous standard.
   Derwinski and other VA officials said they had no way to
estimate the potential cost to the government in added benefits to
veterans if the panel agrees to a statistical assumption that
additional diseases were caused by Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The cost is irrelevant,'' Derwinski said.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, said Derwinski's decision was in line
with congressional wishes that compensation be decided ``on the
basis of sound scientific and medical evidence.''
   ``The judge has said that the department has written the
regulations too narrowly and the department has agreed to go back
and rewrite them,'' Montgomery said. ``I think the secretary has
made the right decision.''
   Of the claims related to Agent Orange already filed, nearly
7,000 involve three main categories of illness _ non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT _
for which some contend links to Agent Orange have been established.

<HEAD>Study: Vietnam Military Dogs Had Almost Twice as Many Testicular
Tumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dogs exposed in Vietnam to the same chemical
sprays as U.S. soldiers developed almost twice as many tumors of
the testicles as military dogs that served only in the United
States, federal investigators report.
   In a study published today in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, researchers said the increased number of testicular
cancers among canine veterans of Vietnam may predict the
development of such tumors among American servicemen who served in
the same country.
   ``The dog is a sentinel model for man,'' said Howard M. Hayes, a
National Cancer Institute researcher and coauthor of the report.
``He could be used to foretell the risks for exposure to the same
chemical insults'' encountered by soldiers in Vietnam.
   Hayes and his coauthors examined autopsy records for dogs that
served with American troops in Vietnam from 1968 to 1973. They also
examined autopsy records of dogs that served in Vietnam and later
died elsewhere.
   These records then were compared with those of military dogs
that served only in the United States, Japan, Korea and Thailand.
   Hayes said the dogs serving in Vietnam had 80 percent more
testis tumors of all kinds than did dogs that served only in the
United States. The Vietnam dogs also had 90 percent more seminomas,
a malignant tumor of the testis.
   Dogs serving in Korea, Japan and Thailand had fewer of both
types of tumors than did the U.S. dogs.
   To further verify the risks, Hayes said his group examined
records of 96 male dogs that served in Vietnam and died elsewhere
between 1974 and 1978. These records were compared with those of
dogs that served only in the United States and died during the same
period.
   ``We observed the 96 Vietnam veteran military working dogs to
have significant excess risk for seminoma, which supported the
findings in the earlier period,'' the report said.
   Additionally, the study showed that dogs that served in Vietnam
had 70 percent to 100 percent more testicular dysfunction than did
dogs that served only in the United States.
   Hayes said about 99 percent of the military dogs in the study
were German shepherds, a breed that has a predisposition to
testicular tumors.
   As a result, he said, the dogs ``may be a particularly sensitive
sentinel for exposures leading to increase seminoma risk in man.''
   Dogs in Vietnam, Hayes said, served side-by-side with infantry
troops and were exposed to the same chemical sprays, such as the
herbicide Agent Orange, as were the soldiers.
   Unlike most of the humans, however, the dogs' tours in Vietnam
were not limited to one year.
   Additionally, Hayes said the dogs in Vietnam were treated
several times with tetracycline, an antibiotic used to control a
tick-borne parasitic disease. The tetracycline, the study said,
``may have contributed to the increased risk of testicular
problems.''
   Veterans' groups have contended for years that soldiers who
served in Vietnam have experienced more cancers and other ailments
as a result of their exposure to chemical sprays while in Vietnam.
Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used to defoliate the jungle, has
come under particular attack by veterans' groups as the cause of
cancers and skin ailments.
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs announced earlier this year
that it would provide compensation to Vietnam veterans who have
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma, two cancers that
have been associated with chemicals in Agent Orange.
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a special adviser to Veterans
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, said in an interview that there now
is no compensation provided to Vietnam veterans who develop
testicular cancers. He said the new study may cause tumors of the
testis to be considered as possibly service-related illnesses for
Vietnam veterans.
   ``I've already recommended that testicular cancer be included
and this (the Hayes study) is powerful evidence in support of it,''
he said.
   Zumwalt had a son who served in Vietnam and later died of
cancer, which Zumwalt attributed to Agent Orange.

   The Centers for Disease Control said today its
long-awaited study of Agent Orange shows Vietnam veterans at
increased risk of only one type of cancer _ and ``no evidence''
that the risk stems from exposure to the dangerous herbicide used
in the war.
   The study, which had been criticized by veterans groups even
before it was released, focused on Vietnam veterans and cancer, and
``only indirectly evaluated Agent Orange exposure,'' the CDC said.
   But it added that the cancer risk among the vets in the study
``seemed to be the opposite of the pattern for use of Agent
Orange.'' Veterans who served on Navy ships were somewhat more
likely to get cancer than those who served on land, and veterans
who served in the region of heaviest Agent Orange use were at
``somewhat lower risk'' than others, the CDC said.
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the U.S. military to remove jungle and
crops in Vietnam, contained dioxin, a highly toxic chemical that
some studies have found to increase the risk of cancer.
   The CDC study, conducted over five years, surveyed male cancer
patients who were the right age to have served in Vietnam, whether
they did serve or not. They were compared with a group of similar
males with no history of cancer.
   The patients' medical records were examined for six kinds of
cancer, including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group
of cancers which the CDC concedes has been ``of great concern among
Vietnam veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to be at a roughly 50 percent increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a ``relatively rare'' cancer of
the lymphatic system, the CDC said.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said CDC Director William
L. Roper.
   There was ``no evidence,'' the CDC reported, ``that
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was more likely to develop in one group of
Vietnam veterans than in another.''
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men 35 to 59, the age group of most Vietnam vets.
The risk for Vietnam vets is about 1.5 per 10,000, Roper said.
   But the CDC found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The Veterans Administration has been awaiting the study before
making its decision on whether to award benefits to veterans
exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed
citing the chemical as a cause of disabilities, including cancer,
skin disease and miscarriages by veterans' wives.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said today that based on
the study he would order compensation paid to veterans suffering
from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Derwinski, in announcing the move in Washington, mentioned only
the link between Vietnam service and the lymphoma. He did not say
the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   His announcement speeds up VA action on the findings; the agency
had said it would submit the study to a review panel.
   American Legion officials told their Vietnam veteran members in
advance of today's announcement that they should not be too
optimistic about this study, which was mandated by Congress.
   ``The government has ducked the issue of Agent Orange for more
than a dozen years,'' said the legion's national commander, Miles
S. Epling. ``We are tired of waiting for more studies, especially
irrelevant ones.''
   The legion has accused CDC of ignoring military records that
could have produced a more detailed study.
   The CDC study found that the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was
nearly double _ 90 percent higher _ for Navy veterans stationed on
ocean ships than for non-veterans. That was the only statistically
significant risk for any branch of service, said Dr. Daniel A.
Hoffman, assistant director for science at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   For all veterans, the 50 percent higher risk of that type of
cancer is what epidemiologists call ``a weak association,'' Hoffman
said. While statistically significant, ``anything less than a
twofold increase can sometimes be caused by other factors,'' he
said.
   The CDC study did not suggest reasons for the increased risk for
one cancer over another, or for the increased risk among Navy
sailors at sea.
   The study did not include blood tests to determine the actual
amount of dioxin that might remain in the cancer patients'
bloodstream two decades or more after military service.
   Hoffman said such tests were not a practical way to determine
dioxin exposure because it is possible that test findings might be
tainted by the patients' illness itself.

   Vietnam veterans suffering from cancers and
other ailments presumably linked to exposure to Agent Orange would
receive government compensation under a bill introduced Tuesday in
the House.
   The measure represents the latest round of a struggle between
veterans' advocates, who say the government is ignoring evidence
about the deadly herbicide, and government scientists, who say no
clear cause and effect can be established.
   ``This legislation takes the important breakthrough step in
creating a presumption that certain conditions, if developed in an
individual after exposure, are presumed related to that exposure
and are our country's responsibility _ not a burden of that
conflict to be borne in tragic isolation by the veteran,'' said
Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., a Marine veteran of Vietnam and one
of 60 co-sponsors of the bill.
   The bill, introduced by Reps. Lane Evans, D-Ill., and Martin
Lancaster, D-N.C., allows veterans to be compensated longer and for
more diseases than a version that has cleared the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee.
   Under the House bill, costing about $40 million a year, veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and
basal cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability
benefits. So would their survivors.
   The bill would also establish a presumption of service
connection for any Vietnam veteran with chloracne, a skin
condition, provided it occurred within a year of service.
   The Senate bill, covering only soft tissue sarcoma and
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, would provide benefits until April 15, 1992.
   The House and Senate bills would both require extensive
record-keeping based on health reports and tissue samples from
veterans. Both would ask the National Academy of Sciences to review
scientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, with
the Department of Veterans Affairs making its benefits
determinations based on those reviews.
   Veterans are already allowed to receive outpatient and hospital
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.
   The Senate passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measure
never emerged from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
committee, and the senior minority member, Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
sent their colleagues a three-page letter Tuesday calling the newly
introduced bill ``premature at best.''
   They cited an ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control
on the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,
due for completion next spring. They also cited a federal court
order to change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studies
and the recent creation of a U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals to
review claims.
   But supporters of the bill say the CDC and VA have dragged their
feet in trying to determine whether a link exists between Agent
Orange exposure and the various afflictions.
   CDC was accused in a House Government Operations subcommittee
hearing two weeks ago of botching or rigging its Agent Orange study
to fail. CDC contends it dropped a massive study of Agent Orange
exposure because there was no way to tell who was exposed.
   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide wre sprayed during the
war to remove the lush foliage that provided ground cover to the
enemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmful
chemicals.
   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel served within the
borders of South Vietnam. About 250,000 have told VA they believe
they were exposed, and 35,000 have applied for disability benefits.

   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., whose son died of
cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange that his father had
ordered sprayed in Vietnam, has been named a senior adviser to
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, the department said
Friday.
   The appointment of Zumwalt, 68, is one of several steps the VA
department has taken under Derwinski to address the concerns of
veterans who have health problems that they say are linked to
exposure to the defoliant.
   The VA said Zumwalt will counsel on a variety of issues, but
``the first on the agenda will be Agent Orange.''
   Zumwalt, who retired as chief of naval operations in 1974, was
commander of in-country naval forces in Vietnam in the late 1960s,
when Agent Orange was sprayed in the Mekong Delta.
   His son, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, had served as a patrol boat
commander at the same time. He died in August 1988 of a form of
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. He was 42.
   A grandson, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a congenital
dysfunction of his physical senses. Agent Orange has also been
blamed for birth defects.
   The father has said he still would have ordered spraying the
defoliant because overall casualties were reduced.
   The two co-wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son,'' about the
experience. It was later made into a television movie.
   On Monday, the VA Department published regulations creating
less-stringent guidelines for determining whether there is a link
between Agent Orange exposure and a host of ailments. A VA panel
will re-examine studies in November in light of the new guidelines.
   Government scientists have said there is no way of determining a
positive link, a position challenged by veterans groups and outside
scientists. The American Legion, for example, has released a major
study showing that exposure is related to benign fatty tumors,
adult acne, skin rash with blisters, several other ailments and an
increased risk of miscarriages in wives of veterans.
   Although the study said it couldn't determine a link with cancer
because the sample was too small, the legion said the methodology
proved such a study could be made.
   The new regulations allow for a link to be established if
studies ``permit the conclusion that it is at least as likely as
not that the purported relationship between a particular type of
exposure and a specific adverse health effect exists.''
   Some 35,000 veterans have filed Agent Orange claims, but only
five have been allowed because of the policy that no firm
connection exists. More than 230,000 veterans have reported their
exposure to the VA. About 2.6 million personnel served within the
borders of South Vietnam.

   David Maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his
country. His country, until now, has disagreed.
   The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the
shoulder seven years after Maier's discharge from the Navy.
   But the Vietnam veteran, now 46 and living in Bay Village, Ohio,
puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide
U.S. troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast Asia. He is
convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored Mekong River water
pumped aboard his ship for showers.
   Like more than 34,000 other Vietnam veterans who believe they
have become ill because of Agent Orange, Maier applied for
government disability benefits. And like all but five of those
applicants, he was denied.
   Now Maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a
federal judge's ruling in San Francisco last month that found the
government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the
doubt.
   To the surprise of many veterans, the Bush administration decided
not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary Edward Derwinski
announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for
the Veterans Administration, would rewrite its rules for granting
disability.
   Derwinski's decision could open the door to claims from hundreds
of thousands of Vietnam veterans.
   Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent
Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never
applied because they believed they didn't stand a chance of getting
disability.
   Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously
optimistic that the VA has changed its attitude along with its name.
   ``It is our feeling at this point that Secretary Derwinski really
does want to see some change,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, the group that brought the lawsuit in
San Francisco.
   Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep
bitterness that many Vietnam veterans feel toward a government that
they believe used and abandoned them.
   ``We'll believe it when we see it,'' said James Sparrow, the
executive director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, an
advocacy group based in Stamford, Conn.
   ``It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they
can,'' said Sandra Hosty, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a
San Francisco group that provides counseling and representation for
veterans seeking benefits.
   Still, Ms. Hosty added, ``I would love to be surprised. I would
love to be wrong.''
   Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was
stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a
50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
   In Vietnam, U.S. troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to
strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked
devastatingly well.
   The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is
present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance
ever tested on laboratory animals.
   Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the
herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT.
   The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe
skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that
they got the rash from Agent Orange, a burden that has been
impossible for most to meet.
   However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of
responsibility, the VA has provided free medical care to anyone who
believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange.
   Under Derwinski's new orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits,
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a
``significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange
and a disease.
   A scientific advisory committee planned to review the proposed
changes at a meeting today with changes to be published in the
Federal Register. Derwinski will make a final decision on the
changes, probably in October.
   Once new guidelines are in place, the VA's advisory committee
will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and
diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final
decision will be up to Derwinski.
   The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest.
After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical
companies settled out of court for $180 million in 1984.
   Derwinski has said cost is irrelevant to the VA's stance.
Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or
Social Security, currently range from $73 a month for a veteran who
is 10 percent disabled to $1,468 a month for a veteran who is 100
percent disabled.
   If just 30,000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled, the
cost to the government would be more than $26 million a year.
   For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt
the VA will adopt sweeping changes.
   ``The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of
thousands of claims,'' said Sparrow. ``I just don't see how they
could do it.''
   Fred Juarbe, director of the National Veterans Service program
for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, commended Derwinski for taking ``a
step in the right direction.''
   Still, Juarbe said, ``I think the bottom line is, we're still
going to require legislation. ... Given the way the VA has ruled in
the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the Department of
Veterans Affairs to carry out this policy.''
   One such piece of legislation was introduced in Congress earlier
this month. A bill by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., would provide disability benefits
for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma,
two of the diseases associated with Agent Orange.
   ``It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most
connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to
begin helping Vietnam veterans,'' said Kerry, a former Navy
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the Mekong Delta.
   George Claxton, a former Army sergeant who was, along with Maier,
one of the original plaintiffs in the San Francisco lawsuit against
the VA, said he is optimistic about prospects for change.
   ``I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated
with justice and compassion,'' said Claxton, 46, of Lansing, Mich.,
who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis
and a nervous disorder.
   However, he added: ``Personally, I don't ever expect to be paid
back for what Agent Orange did to me. You pay a heavy price for
war.''

   Government scientists, who a week ago
announced that a study found no link between Agent Orange exposure
and a rare form of cancer among Vietnam veterans, say the herbicide
cannot be ruled out, either.
   The chief investigator for the Selected Cancers Study said
Wednesday that the findings don't eliminate an Agent Orange
connection.
   ``The study does not rule out that Agent Orange may cause
cancer,'' Dr. Edward Brann of the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta told the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   Asked about this afterward, Brann added: ``Agent Orange may
cause cancer. We don't know from this study.''
   In a summary of the study released last week, CDC said: ``We
found no evidence that the increased risk of NHL (non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma) might be related to exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam.''
   The summary noted the study's determination that sailors with
the least exposure to Agent Orange were more prone than ground
troops to get the disease, and that veterans from the region that
included the area of highest use of the herbicide had a lower risk.
   ``These data, along with evidence from other studies regarding
the likelihood of Vietnam veterans' exposure to Agent Orange, make
it quite unlikely that the increased risk of NHL among Vietnam
veterans results from exposure to herbicides,'' it added.
   Brann and CDC Director William L. Roper told lawmakers that the
study must be seen in the light of other scientific research.
   Still, members of the panel questioned the reliability of the
study in the 12-year-old debate over Agent Orange. Brann himself
said he did not approve of one major question veterans were asked
to determine whether they had been exposed to the herbicide, which
was sprayed on jungle areas in Vietnam to deny cover to the enemy.
   Veterans were asked if they had been in defoliated areas.
   Interpretations of the CDC study by scientists, veterans
organizations and the Department of Veterans Affairs have varied
widely because the new report looked only obliquely at Agent Orange
exposure.
   The original intent of the study was to look at Agent Orange and
its relationship to various cancers on the assumption that 25
percent of Vietnam veterans were exposed to the herbicide.
   CDC later changed course, however, deciding that the ``results
of several studies'' make the premise of 25 percent exposure
``unlikely.''
   The study found a 50 percent higher risk of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma in all Vietnam veterans compared with the overall male
population, but no significantly higher risk for five other
cancers. The VA last week decided to award disability payments to
those veterans as a result.
   Agent Orange were sprayed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970,
according to the VA. The herbicide has two active phenoxy
ingredients, but the prime suspect is another ingredient, dioxin,
with which it was contaminated.
   Dioxin is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   More than 36,000 of the nation's 2.6 million Vietnam veterans
have requested benefits based on claims they suffered diseases
attributable to Agent Orange. Only three of those veterans have
been granted disability payments _ for a skin condition known as
chloracne.
   Roper said the Air Force's ``Ranch Hand'' study of the people
who flew the Agent Orange spraying operations and handled the
barrels of the herbicide puts the new study in the right
perspective.
   He said the men in that study were known to have been exposed to
dioxin, yet have not developed cancers.
   But Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, said that study ignored the
ground troops who ``ate, breathed, drank and sometimes slept in
Agent Orange.''

   David Maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his
country. His country, until now, has disagreed.
   The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the
shoulder seven years after Maier's discharge from the Navy.
   But the Vietnam veteran, now 46 and living in Bay Village, Ohio,
puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide
U.S. troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast Asia. He is
convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored Mekong River water
pumped aboard his ship for showers.
   Like more than 34,000 other Vietnam veterans who believe they
have become ill because of Agent Orange, Maier applied for
government disability benefits. And like all but five of those
applicants, he was denied.
   Now Maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a
federal judge's ruling in San Francisco last month that found the
government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the
doubt.
   To the surprise of many veterans, the Bush administration decided
not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary Edward Derwinski
announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for
the Veterans Administration, would rewrite its rules for granting
disability.
   Derwinski's decision could open the door to claims from hundreds
of thousands of Vietnam veterans.
   Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent
Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never
applied because they believed they didn't stand a chance of getting
disability.
   Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously
optimistic that the VA has changed its attitude along with its name.
   ``It is our feeling at this point that Secretary Derwinski really
does want to see some change,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, the group that brought the lawsuit in
San Francisco.
   Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep
bitterness that many Vietnam veterans feel toward a government that
they believe used and abandoned them.
   ``We'll believe it when we see it,'' said James Sparrow, the
executive director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, an
advocacy group based in Stamford, Conn.
   ``It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they
can,'' said Sandra Hosty, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a
San Francisco group that provides counseling and representation for
veterans seeking benefits.
   Still, Ms. Hosty added, ``I would love to be surprised. I would
love to be wrong.''
   Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was
stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a
50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.

lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT.
   The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe
skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that

<HEAD>Secretary Derwinski Delays Agent Orange Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans' Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski
says he won't decide before March whether to grant disability
payments to Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski said Friday he won't make his decision until the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta releases the results of a
study begun in 1985. The study is expected in March.
   After a Nov. 3 advisory committee meeting, Derwinski had
promised a decision in a few weeks.
   CDC epidemiologists in 1985 launched a major study of the health
records of thousands of veterans to see if they were at increased
risk of five types of cancer: lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and
nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer.
   The advisory committee said after reviewing more than 30 studies
that it could not find a statistically significant relationship
between a rare cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and exposure to the
chemicals used in the defoliant Agent Orange.
   In May, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the
department had been too strict in denying disability benefits on
the grounds there was no proof that those chemicals caused the
illnesses cited by some 34,000 veterans.
   Instead, the judge said the department need only find
statistically significant associations between exposure and
illness. Derwinski decided not to appeal the decision.
   Derwinski said in a statement Friday that several committee
members had said the CDC study could weigh heavily in their
recommendations.
   ``I am as determined now to resolve this issue as I was when I
decided not to appeal the court decision, but it is logical to wait
for a few extra months for the results of the CDC cancer study,''
he said.
   Agent Orange, used in Vietnam to strip vegetation cover used by
guerrillas, has been blamed by veterans' groups for many disorders,
particularly cancer, because it was contaminated with dioxins, a
byproduct of its manufacture.
   Some of the 75 dioxin compounds are among the most powerful
causes of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, but it has
never been proven they can cause cancer in humans.
   Exposure to dioxin in high concentrations is known to cause
chloracne, a skin disorder, and recent work has led some scientists
to suspect dioxin may also cause birth defects.
   In 1986, Congress required the Veterans Administration to give
hospital care to any veteran exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam
unless the VA found some other cause for his disability.

<P>
In a significant shift in federal policy, Vietnam veterans suffering from a 
rare form of cancer that they claim was caused by exposure to the defoliant 
Agent Orange will receive full disability benefits, Veterans Affairs officials 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control found in a study released 
Thursday that Vietnam veterans are 50% more likely than non-veterans to 
contract non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, even though they specifically denied a link 
between Agent Orange exposure and incidence of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Acting immediately after receipt of the CDC study, Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs Edward J. Derwinski ordered full benefits paid to some 1,800 veterans 
who currently suffer from the disease and to the expected 450 new cases 
expected each year for the next several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's decision marks the first time that the federal government has 
acknowledged a link between service in Vietnam and incidence of any form of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans groups applauded the decision, but said that tens of thousands of 
Vietnam veterans still await government help in coping with several cancers and 
other health problems they believe were caused by Agent Orange exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC study and the shift in VA policy will not end the long, bitter dispute 
over Agent Orange and cancer, veterans' advocates and government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While the CDC study found a clear link between service in Vietnam and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CDC Director Dr. William L. Roper stated: "The study 
did not find any evidence that the increased risk might be due to Agent Orange 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected and unexplained finding, Roper noted that sailors who served 
on ships far off the Vietnam coast suffered the highest incidence of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, also known as NHL. Soldiers and airmen who served in 
III Corps, the area of the heaviest spraying of the chemical herbicide, were at 
lower risk of contracting the disease, the CDC found. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said the link between service in Vietnam and the cancer was 
compelling enough to demand action, but the VA chief offered no opinion as to 
whether Agent Orange played a part in generating the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate may well go on forever," Derwinski said in a press conference. 
"There may never be enough scientific and technical evidence to put to rest 
forever all the charges and countercharges relating to Agent Orange." 
</P>
<P>
He called Thursday's action "a practical and humanitarian decision." He 
stressed it was "not a scientific decision, and it should not be seen as one. 
It was a policy determination. . . . Remember, this is a kinder, gentler 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 36,000 Vietnam veterans have applied for VA benefits on claims that they 
contracted cancer or other maladies as a result of exposure to Agent Orange, a 
defoliant containing dioxin, a highly toxic agent that was widely sprayed in 
Vietnam from 1961 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Agent Orange cancer claims have until now been denied, although 
21,000 of the Agent Orange claimants are receiving medical care from the VA, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary R. Trout, national president of the Vietnam Veterans of America and one of 
the most vocal critics of federal policy on Agent Orange, called Derwinski's 
decision "very positive." 
</P>
<P>
But she quickly added: "We still have some concerns. If it takes a 50% increase 
(in the incidence of a cancer) to win benefits, then it's going to take a very 
long time for other veterans" to be compensated for Vietnam-related health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Miles S. Epling, national commander of the American Legion, praised Derwinski 
for "taking one small step toward resolution of this problem we've been 
fighting for over 10 years." He said he hoped Derwinski would now speed 
consideration of claims based on 10 other maladies that veterans say are 
related to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But Epling blasted the CDC study as "irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with Agent Orange, and it says so. It's a piece of 
garbage as far as we're concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC study looked at cases of six types of cancer among Vietnam veterans and 
other men between the ages of 35 and 59. The study found that the Vietnam 
veterans were at no greater risk than the non-veterans of contracting five of 
the cancers: soft-tissue and other sarcomas, Hodgkin's disease, nasal cancer, 
nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer originating in the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The VA will continue to deny benefits to Vietnam veterans with these cancers 
who claim they are service-connected, but Derwinski left open the possibility 
that future research could support payment of such claims. 
</P>
<P>
For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes and lymphatic tissues 
that is similar to leukemia, Vietnam veterans were 50% more likely to come down 
with the disease than those in the same age group who did not serve in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
NHL has a latency period of 15 to 25 years and if left untreated is virtually 
always fatal. Chemotherapy has prolonged the life of a number of NHL patients 
but has not reversed the degenerative disease. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said that for VA purposes, any Vietnam veteran with NHL will be 
considered 100% disabled and will be paid full benefits -- today worth about 
$1,527 a month -- for the rest of his life. Widows and children of NHL victims 
will also be entitled to maximum compensation, $500-$1,000 a month depending on 
the veteran's rank at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Vietnam veterans who claim Agent Orange-related health problems 
are eligible for compensation from a $180-million fund established by seven 
chemical companies that produced the defoliant. The firms agreed to provide the 
money as the result of a class-action lawsuit by veterans. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 17,000 servicemen have been declared eligible for compensation from the 
fund and have received a total of $84 million, according to attorneys handling 
the fund.

<TEXT>
   The jury remains out on Agent Orange even
though a decade has passed since Congress told government scientists
to determine whether a link exists between the herbicide and
ailments among Vietnam veterans.
   Hearings last week on Capitol Hill showed that while veterans
demand compensation for ills _ including cancer, birth defects, and
miscarriages _ they maintain are linked to exposure to the
dioxin-containing substance, scientists are disputing how to go
about a study.
   There were charges of political concerns eclipsing scientific
ones, and pleas for science to yield to human concerns. Critics of
the Centers for Disease Control, where most research is done, say
results and action are long overdue.
   ``It's just terribly frustrating,'' said Paul S. Egan,
legislative director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. He said
veterans were literally ``drenched'' with Agent Orange and nothing
has happened, yet ``we're alarmed if there seems to be dioxin in
coffee filters.''
   Action is possible in the next year or two, due in part to a
decision by Edward J. Derwinski, secretary of the new Veterans
Affairs Department.
   The former congressman was put on the spot when U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco ordered the VA
department to revise how it determines the possible health effects
of exposure to Agent Orange.
   Henderson said the VA had imposed an ``impermissibly demanding
test'' for connecting Agent Orange with health problems.
   Derwinski decided against an appeal, meaning there will be new
rules in October.
   The new rules would affect the claims by nearly 35,000 veterans
who say they have disorders caused by Agent Orange. Only five claims
have been allowed, and those were all for a skin ailment known as
chloracne.
   The Senate may pass legislation that would provide interim
temporary payment of VA benefits to Vietnam veterans suffering from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma and soft tissue carcinoma, both cancers linked
to Agent Orange.
   Already, because of legislation passed in 1981, lower-income
veterans ``who believe'' their health problems are caused by Agent
Orange may receive VA care, the VA says.
   The Senate had passed an interim payment measure last fall, but
it was opposed by the Reagan administration and died in the House.
The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee approved a new bill last week.
   The sponsors, Sens. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., and Thomas Daschle,
D-S.D., take Derwinksi's decision on the appeal as a good sign.
   On the House side, the outlook is questionable. Tim Sechrist, an
aide to Rep. Douglas Applegate, says Applegate wants to look at the
VA's new regulations. The Ohio Democrat is chairman of the Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee on compensation pension and insurance.
   VA Committee chairman G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery of Mississippi
told his hospitals and health care subcommittee Monday: ``I am
concerned that too many times the emotion surrounding this topic is
the result of apparent mismatches between hoped-for results and the
actual scientific results of studies of Agent Orange. ...
   ``In the other body, there is legislation pending that deals with
compensation for certain diseases on the basis of feared exposure to
Agent Orange. We should not act until exposure is known and the link
between exposure and disease is assessed. We know we cannot simply
rely on service in Vietnam as an indicator of exposure.''
   Those were the issues government scientists were supposed to
start addressing 10 years ago. Hearings Monday and Tuesday showed
what has happened.
   CDC scientist Dr. Vernon N. Houk said a study is impossible
because its results can't be validated. The result was cancellation
in 1986 of a massive epidemiological study undertaken in 1983, with
$19 million of its cost unspent.
   VA was given some $3 million of that last year to conduct blood
tests on Air Force veterans of Ranch Hand, the Agent Orange spraying
operation in which 1,200 people participated. The Air Force, in an
ongoing study criticized by outsiders, says so far the death rate
among Ranch Handers is no different from that of the general
population and there is no proof of a link to cancer.
   Houk said there was no way to prove where a soldier was when 12
million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over Vietnam between
1965 and 1970 to destroy the dense foliage that provided cover to
the enemy.
   Witnesses, including former government scientists, challenged the
CDC in a hearing Tuesday of an oversight subcommittee of the
Government Operations Committee. They said CDC ignored detailed
records of spraying and troop movements available in Washington and
elsewhere, and tried to water down both the Agent Orange study and a
separate Vietnam Experience Study.
   Government scientists, in turn, criticized a study done by
Columbia University scientists Jeanne and Steven Stellman for the
American Legion.
   The study, matching a mail survey of 6,810 veterans with
government records on troop movements and herbicide spraying, found
a correlation between Agent Orange and various health complaints
reported by the veterans. There were no results on cancer.
   Congress' Office of Technology Assessment said the American
Legion self-reporting study suffered from inaccurate recollections
by veterans 20 years after service, imprecise depiction of
locations, and spray paths that are too wide to be useful.
   Governments officials say more will be known next spring when CDC
releases a study of the incidence of selected cancers in Vietnam
veterans. They also say scientists are better able to test blood for
dioxin and they have a better idea how long dioxin remains in the
body.
   Whatever those results, one scientist says an open mind is the
answer. ``As long as there are millions of veterans and family
members who have a legitimate health concern regarding this issue,
it is incumbent upon us to consider any and all possibilities, and
certainly to consider new technology and lateral approaches in this
area,'' said Dr. Michael E. Kafrissen, former visiting scientist at
CDC.

   The Senate approved legislation Thursday that
would give Vietnam-era veterans disability benefits for certain
illnesses associated with U.S. use of Agent Orange.
   The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through April
15, 1992, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to
make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.
   A broader version is pending in the House.
   Passage of the Senate bill by voice vote was a victory for
veterans advocates, who have been battling government scientists.
They have accused various agencies of ignoring evidence about the
deadly herbicide while government scientists have said that no
clear cause-and-effect relationship has been established.
   ``It has been a long, hard struggle,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the bill and chairman of the Veterans
Affairs Committee. ``Too many Vietnam veterans and their families
have suffered anguish for far too long.''
   ``This bill is important ... obviously because it creates a
presumption in favor of veterans,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
a Vietnam veteran. He said the measure makes it clear that ``there
will not be an adversariness in the attempt by veterans to seek the
services that they are entitled to. ... It does not open up a
Pandora's box of benefits because these are two very rare
diseases.''
   The bill was discussed on the Senate floor late Wednesday and
passed with little difficulty Thursday morning.
   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel were in South
Vietnam during the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some
250,000 have told the Veterans Administration, now the Department
of Veterans Affairs, that they believe they were exposed, and
35,000 have applied for disability benefits.
   Veterans already are allowed to receive outpatient and hospital
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Approximately 12 million gallons of the herbicide were sprayed
during the Vietnam War to remove the foliage providing ground cover
for the enemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmful
chemicals.
   The bill in the House would allow veterans to be compensated
longer, and for more diseases. Under it, veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and basal
cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability benefits.
So would their survivors.
   The House bill has been estimated to cost $40 million. No such
estimate was available for the Senate version, although it would be
considerably less.
   The Senate bill establishes _ for the first time _ a presumption
of service connection for any Vietnam veteran with chloracne, a
skin condition, provided it occurred within a year of the time the
person's service tour ended.
   Both bills require extensive record-keeping by the Veterans
Administration based on health reports and tissue samples from
veterans. Both would ask the National Academy of Sciences to review
scientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, with
the Department of Veterans Affairs making its benefits
determinations based on those reviews.
   The Senate passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measure
never emerged from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of that
committee, and the senior minority member, Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
sent colleagues a letter last month calling the House bill
``premature at best.''
   They cited a continuing study by the Centers for Disease Control
on the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,
due for completion next spring, and noted a federal court order to
change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studies and the
recent creation of a U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals to review
claims.
   But supporters of the bill said the CDC and VA had moved too
slowly to determine whether a link exists between Agent Orange and
the various afflictions.
   During a House Government Operations subcommittee hearing in
early July, the CDC was accused of rigging its Agent Orange study
to show no direct link. Officials of the health agency maintained
that it dropped a massive study of Agent Orange exposure because
there was no way to tell who was exposed.

<HEAD>Panels Challenge VA Authority To Award Back Payments to Vets With
Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressional committees are challenging a
Veterans Affairs Department decision to award back payment of
previously denied claims to Vietnam vets suffering from a rare form
of cancer linked to Agent Orange.
   The Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate
veterans committees wrote a letter to the VA earlier this month
challenging the authority of the department to award retroactive
benefits.
   But the legal issue is caught up in the emotional and complex
issue of compensating veterans who claim they have a variety of
ailments due to exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   The letter, which was first disclosed in Saturday's editions of
The Washington Post, said benefits may be awarded only
``prospectively'' _ from the date of the new regulation _ and not
retroactively.
   It said the VA's decision to set a retroactive effective date
for awarding benefits was unprecedented.
   ``We question whether you have such authority under current law
with respect to a claim after its denial has become final,'' the
April 18 letter to VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said.
   The issue arose March 29, when the VA announced it would award
benefits to anyone who served in Vietnam and later developed
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The announcement came the same day the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said Vietnam vets
had a 50 percent higher risk of developing the disease than did men
who hadn't served.
   But the VA, in its attempt to defuse the lingering Agent Orange
issue, used its file of past Agent Orange claims to come up with
the number of lymphoma victims who should be compensated.
   The government consistently denies a connection between exposure
to the defoliant and a host of ailments, despite claims of veterans
groups, a class-action lawsuit that was settled, and a number of
independent scientists.
   Derwinski asserted that the benefits were for not for Agent
Orange exposure but for anyone who served in Vietnam who has the
cancer. VA was thus able to give some relief without conceding an
association between exposure and disease.
   The same CDC study ruled out an increase in several other
cancers among Vietnam veterans that have been linked to Agent
Orange exposure. The CDC has acknowledged that the study does not
disprove a connection.
   The VA estimated it would have to pay up to $25 million a year
in death and disability benefits to the 1,800 afflicted veterans or
their survivors. It is drafting new regulations to award the claims.
   Should the VA reverse its March 29 decision, those who were
previously denied claims could refile for benefits. The benefits
would become payable from the date of the new regulations or the
date of the CDC study, said Charles Peckarsky, an adviser to the
House committee.
   The letter, which originated in the House VA Committee, is
signed by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat
who chairs the committee; Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., the ranking
minority member; Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the
Senate VA Committee; and Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, the
ranking Republican member.
   VA spokesman Dennis R. Boxx defended Derwinski's action, saying,
``He believes that the decision was a legal decision, but just as
importantly, a fair and humane decision that was appropriate given
all the complex questions and issues.''
   He said the development is ironic because the VA ``is often
accused of not trying to do things that are humane and fair and
compassionate.''
   The committee leaders' views are not necessarily shared by all
the members.
   ``I don't think it behooves veterans advocates to be working
against veterans benefits,'' said Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member
of the committee and a leader of the Vietnam-era veterans caucus in
Congress.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down VA Rules, Orders Vets' Claims Reopened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the U.S. government to
reconsider the Agent Orange health claims of more than 31,000
veterans because existing rules ``sharply tipped the scales''
against those exposed to the toxic defoliant.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson struck down the Department
of Veterans Affairs' regulations that denied Agent Orange
service-related benefits for cancers and all other diseases except
one non-fatal skin condition.
   In a ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of Agent
Orange claimants, Henderson said the department was wrong to
require direct proof that the dioxin-containing herbicide caused
various diseases.
   The department, formerly known as the Veterans Administration,
should give claimants the benefit of the doubt, he said.
   Veterans' advocates praised the decision, which was made public
Monday.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' said
Mary Sout, president of Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying
for years, that the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing. ... I am optimistic that Congress will now act
quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the Vietnam War.''
   Vietnam Veterans of America again will sponsor legislation to
require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer _ soft-tissue
sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and establish a new,
independent scientific panel to study the herbicide's health
effects, said Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for the 35,000-member group.
   A similar bill was passed by the Senate last year but died in
the House, Kasinitz said.
   The veterans department was represented by the Justice
Department. Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown declined to comment on
the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it.
   The United States used Agent Orange to defoliate forests in
Vietnam. Its health effects are sharply disputed.
   In 1985, the VA ruled that only a non-fatal skin malady,
chloracne, could be considered an effect of exposure to the
herbicide. The agency based its ruling on a review of studies of
Agent Orange's effects by an 11-member scientific committee.
   Henderson rejected an attempt by the veterans' group to
challenge the scientific panel's review. But he said the standards
the VA used in making its rules violated a 1984 federal law
designed to help Vietnam veterans get health benefits.
   The VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits
were sought, the judge said. Instead, the agency should have
required only that statistics show a significant correlation
between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an ``increased risk of
incidence,'' he said.
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
members of Congress who helped pass the law indicated they opposed
an overly stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof
was unnecessary, Henderson said. The law's ``remedial purpose''
also favors a lenient standard, he said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of causation, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, Henderson said.
   He also said the VA erred by refusing to apply to its Agent
Orange regulations the same ``benefit of the doubt'' policy it used
to review individual benefit cases, which favors the veteran in
close questions.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' Henderson
said.
   Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any
diseases to the service-connected list for Agent Orange. But
Kasinitz said he was encouraged by the performance of Veterans
Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski.
   ``We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a
fair review under the current administration than we did under the
past one,'' Kasinitz said.

   A Vietnam veterans group in Florida
said Monday it has lost patience with federal government efforts to
study the effects of Agent Orange and will conduct its own survey
on exposure to the toxic defoliant.
   ``This state - the Vietnam veterans of Florida - have said
enough is enough,'' said David Kaufman, a veteran from Fort
Lauderdale. ``We're going to take the bull by the horns.''
   Florida, with about 527,000 Vietnam veterans, is the first state
to attempt such a project, according to Kaufman, chairman of the
Agent Orange Committee of the Vietnam Veterans of Florida.
   The survey has the backing of national Vietnam veterans groups
and individual scientists at the Department for Veterans Affairs,
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease
Control, Kaufman said.
   ``There are scientists and epidemiolgists who work for the VA
and the EPA who are outraged at this latest CDC fiasco,'' Kaufman
told reporters.
   A congressional study released last month charged that the CDC
misspent $6.6 million while conducting a disputed study of the
effects of Agent Orange.
   An estimated 12 million gallons of Agent Orange, composed
primarily of cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed over Vietnam by
U.S. troops between 1965 and 1970 to destroy the jungle that hid
the enemy.
   Veterans groups say exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to
19 types of cancer and other health problems, including birth
defects. Earlier this year, the VA decided to award compensation to
veterans with two rare cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Agent Orange.
   Since 1981, some lower-income veterans who believe their health
problems are caused by Agent Orange have received VA care, the VA
said.
   But the veterans are a long way from getting the government to
acknowledge that Agent Orange has caused lingering diseases in
veterans and birth defects in their children, veterans groups say.
   The CDC has said that military records did not identify veterans
who had been exposed to the chemical.
   ``We're going to provide them with information,'' Kaufman said.
   He said there are 116 scientists from the VA, CDC and EPA ``who
have pledged that if we get them the surveys they will go through
them.'' Those scientists, whom Kaufman would not name, also helped
write the 116-question survey, he said.
   The organization has printed only 1,000 surveys thus far. It
wants to get 500,000 distributed and returned within six months.
Kaufman said it will cost about $3 million to conduct the survey,
and that veterans would have to raise money as they go to pay for
the project.
   About 200 surveys were handed out Monday to veterans gathered
for Veterans Day ceremonies at the group's Tallahassee
headquarters, Kaufman said.

<TEXT>
   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, son of the
admiral who ordered the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam and who
was exposed to the defoliant himself, died at his home Saturday
from cancer. He was 42.
   Zumwalt, a lawyer, said he never blamed his father for his
disease. The two co-wrote a book titled ``My Father, My Son,''
which was made into a television movie.
   Zumwalt was diagnosed in January 1983 as having stage 4
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In February 1985, during his ninth biopsy,
doctors discovered he had stage 3 Hodgkins disease, another form of
lymphoma.
   Agent Orange contains highly toxic dioxin. Veterans had
contended that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses.
They said it caused miscarriages by wives of servicemen and birth
defects in their children.
   Zumwalt's son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   In an article published in the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 1984,
Zumwalt said: ``My father, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., was a strong
advocate of the use of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. That
doesn't mean that I hold him responsible for any disease I may have
incurred. He did what he felt he had to do to reduce casualties. I
did what I felt I had to do. I volunteered for service in Vietnam
because I felt whatever the risks, that was where I belonged. Even
now at the age of 38 I'm confronted by undoubted perils. I am not
sorry I went.''
   On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court removed the last legal
obstacle to a $180 million settlement between Vietnam veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the 1984 settlement.
   The $180 million settlement now totals about $240 million with
interest. As many as 250,000 people could receive money from the
settlement.
   The elder Zumwalt said he ordered Agent Orange sprayed over the
Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive ``the Viet Cong back
1,000 yards off the water's edge.''
   He commanded Naval forces in Vietnam from 1968-1970, then served
as chief of Naval operations until 1974 when he retired from active
duty. His son served in Vietnam from June 1969 to August 1970 as a
lieutenant junior grade commanding a patrol boat.
   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then
and I am convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally
hundreds and maybe thousands of lives,'' the elder Zumwalt told The
Associated Press in 1985.
   In addition to his son, Zumwalt is survived by his wife,
Katherine; and his daughter, Maya, 13.

<HEAD>Jail Cells More Crowded Despite New Construction</HEAD>

   Crowding increased at local jails between 1983
and 1988 as new construction failed to keep pace with a 54 percent
jump in the number of prisoners, the Justice Department says.
   The amount of space for each inmate shrunk 6 percent from 54.3
square feet in 1983 to 50.9 square feet in 1988, despite a 43.7
percent increase in total jail space, according to a study released
Sunday by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   A census of the nation's 3,316 jails found that on June 30,
1988, there were 341,636 prisoners living in 17.4 million square
feet of space. Five years earlier, 223,272 inmates occupied 12.1
million square feet.
   The bureau's study found that 28 percent of the nation's jails
in 1988 housed more than 40 percent of their inmates in cells
smaller than the standard of 60 square feet recommended by the
American Correctional Association.
   In 1983, only 23 percent of the jails housed inmates in cells
smaller than the standard.
   The proportion of jails placing five or more people in a
``housing unit'' increased from 24 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in
1988, the study said, and the average occupancy rose from 2.4
inmates per unit to 2.5 inmates.
   In 1988, 61 percent of all jail inmates lived in the most
crowded facilities.

<HEAD>Agent Orange Study Expected This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study expected to be released this week will
help determine officially whether Vietnam veterans who were exposed
to the herbicide Agent Orange suffered cancers and other ailments
as a result.
   The study by the federal Centers for Disease Control, which the
Veterans Affairs Department says will be released Thursday,
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among Vietnam vets.
It is another step in a 12-year battle to gain benefits for
veterans who blame the powerful foliage killer for cancers, skin
disease and miscarriages in their spouses.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski last Novemer said he would
postpone a determination on whether to award benefits until after
the study was completed. Following its release, the study must be
reviewed by a VA advisory committee of outside scientists.
   Derwinski will make a determination at the end of May after the
committee meets, VA spokesman Don Smith said last week. Final rules
should be in place in October. The decision also could influence
legislation in Congress requiring compensation to veterans.
   Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed citing Agent Orange, which
was sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops, as a cause of
disabilities. An additional 230,000 veterans have told VA they were
exposed to the herbicide, which contained highly toxic dioxin and
other suspected harmful ingredients.
   The new Selected Cancers Study by the CDC in Atlanta does not
look at whether veterans were exposed to Agent Orange.
   According to the VA, the new study will determine whether
Vietnam veterans are at higher risk of developing soft-tissue
sarcoma, lymphoma and nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer. The
study began in 1985.

Mr Leake Hangala, the mines and energy permanent secretary, said the
government was drafting mining legislation, a mining tax policy and a labour
code to promote mining and energy exploration.
He added that he hoped the legislation would be enacted during the current
session of the national assembly.
Only two days ago the South African company Revere Resources announced it
intended to develop a major copper mine in Namibia. Mr Hangala described
this development as exciting.
The company said it planned to spend about R280m (Pounds 48m) developing the
Haib porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit, where reserves of 1.5bn tonnes of
ore have been identified north of the Orange River border.
The mine is expected to begin initial production before the end of the year.

A federal judge has thrown out the Veterans Administration's rules on health

reconsider the claims of more than 31,000 Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
In denying most claims for health benefits related to Agent Orange, the VA 
wrongly required proof that the herbicide causes various diseases, U. S. 
District Judge Thelton Henderson said in a decision made public Monday. 
Statistical evidence showing a significant correlation between Agent Orange and 
the diseases would be sufficient, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another, sharply tipped 
the scales against veteran claimants," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide suit on behalf of Agent Orange claimants, Henderson struck down 
VA regulations that deny Agent Orange service-connected health benefits for 
cancers and all other diseases except one non-fatal skin condition, chloracne. 
He also ordered the VA to reopen all claims denied under those rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory with far-reaching implications," Mary Stout, president 
of Vietnam Veterans of America, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying for years, that 
the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a fair hearing. . . . I am 
optimistic that Congress will now act quickly to resolve this most painful 
legacy of the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for the 35,000-member group, said it will again 
sponsor legislation to require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer -- 
soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma -- and establish a new scientific 
panel, independent of the VA, to study the herbicide's health effects. A 
similar bill was passed by the Senate last year but died in the House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any diseases 
to the service-connected list for Agent Orange, Kasinitz said the performance 
so far of the secretary of the new Cabinet-level Department of Veterans 
Affairs, Edward Derwinski, provides some grounds for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a fair review under 
the current Administration than we did under the past one," Kasinitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The VA was represented by the Justice Department, whose spokeswoman, Amy Brown, 
declined comment on the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a defoliant by the 
United States in Vietnam. Its health effects are sharply disputed. 
</P>
<P>
The VA, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific committee, ruled in 1985 
that only one condition, chloracne, could be considered a service-connected 
effect of exposure to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the scientific 
committee's review of studies on the effects of Agent Orange. But the judge 
said the standards the VA used in making its rules violated a 1984 federal law 
that was supposed to help Vietnam veterans get the health benefits they were 
due. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect 
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits would be 
granted. Instead, he said, the agency should have required only that statistics 
show a significant correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an 
"increased risk of incidence." 
</P>
<P>
The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but comments by members 
of Congress involved in passing the law showed that they opposed an overly 
stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof was unnecessary, 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the VA had relied on statistical relationships, without requiring 
proof of causation, in granting benefits to veterans who were amputees and 
developed heart disease. Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to 
former prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, relying on a VA 
statistical study, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also found an error in the VA's refusal to apply to its Agent Orange 
regulations the same "benefit of the doubt" policy it uses for review of 
individual benefit cases -- a policy that favors the veteran in close 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the language of the law is unclear, the "remedial purpose" of the law 
favors a lenient standard, Henderson said. Noting that veterans would be 
entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual claims, he said 
Congress would not have intended to put them in a worse position through a 
collective regulation.

<HEAD>Zumwalt: Son's Death Pushes Him To Fight Harder For Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumalt Jr., who ordered
the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, says the cancer death of his
son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans
affected by the toxic defoliant.
   ``There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,''
Zumwalt said Saturday, the day his son died. ``I believe very
strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is
responsible for the problems many veterans are having.''
   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, 42, who was exposed to Agent Orange, died
at his home in Fayetteville. He was diagnosed in January 1983 as
having non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Two years later doctors found he had
lymphoma Hodgkins disease.
   Zumwalt's son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   Since the war, Adm. Zumwalt and his son had pushed for
government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange.
   On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court removed the last legal
obstacle to a $180 million settlement between Vietnam veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the 1984 settlement.
   In Washington, a White House spokesman said, ``The President and
Mrs. Reagan are deeply saddened and extend their prayers to the
Zumwalt family.''
   The younger Zumwalt was commanding a boat along the rivers of
the Ca Mau Peninsula when his father, the American naval commander
in Vietnam, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to defoliate the
jungle along the waterways in order to save servicemen by depriving
the enemy of concealment for ambushes.
   Before the spraying, U.S. forces had a 6 percent casualty rate
each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent.
   ``I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor
do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always
his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger Zumwalt
once said. ``I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a
man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.''
   Young Zumwalt once swam through water doused with Agent Orange
to collect weapons from a convoy of Viet Cong boats, winning over a
hostile crew that had called him ``the little admiral'' and ``brass
brat'' behind his back.
   The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with
the book, ``My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author John
Pekkanen. The book was presented in a made-for-television movie in
May.
   Zumwalt said his son was strong until the end, even joking and
teasing with family members during conversations that began Friday
evening.
   ``We had a long conversation, his wife and children and his
brother and me, with him from about 7:30 (Friday night) until about
1 o'clock this morning,'' the admiral said Saturday. ``He was
rational and very courageous.''
   Zumwalt was standing by his son's side with other family members
when his son died in his sleep.

   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, who died of
cancer two decades after his father ordered use of Agent Orange in
Vietnam, once swam through water doused with the defoliant to
collect weapons from Viet Cong boats.
   He won over his crew, but that swim may have marked the
beginning of his last battle, with the cancer that ended his life
Saturday at age 42.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the American naval commander
in Vietnam who ordered the spraying of the defoliant then thought
to be harmless, said his son's death will only push him to work
harder to force the government to compensate veterans who suffered
from Agent Orange's effects.
   ``There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,''
Zumwalt said the day his son died. ``I believe very strongly now

   Zumwalt was commanding a swift boat along the rivers of the Ca
Mau Peninsula when his father, the youngest man ever to serve as
chief of naval operations, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to
save servicemen from being killed by enemy ambushes along the
waterways.
   Before the spraying, U.S. forces had a 6 percent casualty rate
each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent.

<HEAD>Report Says Reagan White House Thwarted Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators say a Reagan White
House plan to deny federal liability in toxic exposure cases led to
the cancellation of a major study of Agent Orange's effects on
Vietnam veterans.
   A House panel concluded in a report issued Thursday that the
White House ``controlled and obstructed'' the study Congress
ordered from the Centers for Disease Control.
   The report by the House Government Operations Committee
supported arguments by the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans
of America. They filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the CDC
resume its study of the health effects of Agent Orange exposure
during the Vietnam war.
   ``While the Reagan administration defended the Vietnam conflict
as an honorable war, it worked behind the scenes to deny benefits
to the very people who sacrificed their health for their country,''
said Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee that
wrote the report.
   The report followed a 14-month investigation and hearings by
Weiss' subcommittee.
   In a written dissent, the subcommittee's ranking Republican said
the report's conclusion of a White House plot to cover up the truth
about Agent Orange ``is simply not supported by the facts.''
   ``Instead of advancing the debate on Agent Orange in a positive
direction, the human resources subcommittee has abused this issue
in order to launch an ideological assault upon a Republican White
House with which it has never agreed,'' Rep. Richard K. Armey,
R-Texas, said.
   Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during
the Vietnam war. It has been blamed by veterans groups for 19
cancers and a variety of other health problems, including birth
defects.
   Congress ordered the CDC study to determine whether Vietnam
veterans had been exposed to Agent Orange. It was to be used as a
basis for other studies measuring links to health problems.
   The report said the White House ordered the study's cancellation
after the CDC said it was scientifically impossible to use military
records to identify veterans who had been exposed.
   The committee said the study should have continued ``because CDC
did not document that exposure could not be assessed'' and
disregarded alternate methods of measuring exposure.
   ``The White House compromised the independence of the CDC and
undermined the study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding
the course of research, at the same time it had secretly taken a
legal position to resist demands to compensate victims of Agent
Orange exposure and industrial accidents,'' the report said.
   At the CDC in Atlanta, spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd said the agency
would have no comment because it had not seen the report. But she
said, ``We do stand by our studies and our decisions.''
   A spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Donna St.
John, said the agency had no comment.
   The study was officially monitored by a White House task force
called the Agent Orange Working Group. The House panel concluded
the White House controlled the study through the working group and
the Office of Management and Budget.
   The panel said that despite evidence Vietnam veterans are more
susceptible to certain forms of cancer and birth defects in their
offspring, the federal government has consistently refused to
acknowledge any link to Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The federal government has suppressed or minimized findings of
ill health effects among Vietnam veterans that could be linked to
Agent Orange exposure,'' the report said.
   But Armey said in his dissent scientific information has failed
to establish any conclusive link between Agent Orange and health
problems. He said that ``compensating veterans for simple exposure
to Agent Orange is a political decision, not a scientific one.''
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to
Agent Orange.

airmen who sprayed Agent Orange -- known as the Ranch Hand group -- with 804

Air Force Base in Texas, said there was "no evidence of a relationship between
dioxin and cancer of any kind, liver disease, heart disease, kidney disease,

diabetes, body fat, non-cancerous growths, cholesterol and white blood cell

sugar and fat and act as an irritant to the body," it said.;    It cautioned
that the results should not be applied directly to all Vietnam veterans
because most had less exposure to dioxin than members of the Ranch Hand group.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Senators Optimistic About Agent Orange Benefits Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators advocating disability benefits for
Vietnam veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by Agent
Orange said Thursday they were confident of finally winning
congressional passage after repeated setbacks.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said the compromise bill would
provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to
the chemical defoliant during the Vietnam War and now suffer from
either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Under the bill, disability benefits would extend only through
1993. Survivors' benefits for spouses would go through mid-April
1992. Congress, which by then would have received a new study by the
Centers for Disease Control, would have to vote to continue the
benefits.
   The measure is needed ``not only to help veterans with their
medical difficulties, but it is also important as a statement that
we intend to make good on our promises to help those who fought in
the war,'' said Kerry, a former Navy lieutenant who piloted a patrol
boat in the Mekong Delta.
   ``Too many veterans remember what it was like to fight the VC
(Viet Cong) They didn't have to come back here to fight the VA
(Veterans Administration, the name still used for the Veterans
Department),'' the senator said.
   Separate Agent Orange bills sponsored by Kerry and Sen. Thomas
Daschle, D-S.D., failed in 1987 and again last year. The Reagan
administration steadfastly opposed the proposals, saying more
scientific evidence was needed to link the chemical defoliant used
by U.S. forces in Southeast Asia to the cancers in the light of
several studies that failed to find such a link.
   But Kerry and Daschle, at a news conference introducing the
legislation, said positive signs from both the new administration
and Capitol Hill account for their optimism.
   The senators said they were encouraged by Veterans Affairs
Secretary Ed Derwinski and his decision last month not to appeal a
federal appeals court's decision striking down regulations to
restrict compensation for Agent Orange victims.
   Derwinski also ordered reviews of the cases of all Vietnam
veterans whose Agent Orange claims were denied. Daschle praised
Derwinski as the ``most sympathetic'' head of the Veterans
Administration since the Vietnam War.
   The bill's prospects improved when Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs, backed it late last year
after various changes to narrow its scope.
   The measure would cost an estimated $19 million annually in
benefits, Senate aides said.

   A federal judge threw out the Department of
Veterans Affairs' rules on Agent Orange health benefits, and
ordered the government to reconsider claims by more than 31,000
veterans.
   In a decision made public Monday, U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson said the agency wrongly required proof that Agent Orange
causes various diseases in denying most claims for benefits related
to the herbicide.
   Henderson, ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of
Agent Orange claimants, said the agency formerly known as the
Veterans Administration failed to give veterans the benefit of the
doubt.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' Henderson
said.
   Henderson struck down regulations denying Agent Orange
service-connected benefits for cancers and all other diseases
except chloracne, a non-fatal skin condtion. He also ordered the
agency to reopen all claims denied under those rules.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' Mary
Stout, president of the 35,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America,
said in a statement.
   ``The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying
for years, that the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing,'' she said. ``I am optimistic that Congress will now
act quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the Vietnam
War.''
   The government is expected to appeal the decision. The VA was
represented by the Justice Department.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown declined to comment on Henderson's
ruling, saying department lawyers had not yet seen it. She said the
department would review the ruling before deciding its next step.
   Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a
defoliant by the United States in Vietnam. Its health effects are
sharply disputed.
   The VA, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific
committee, ruled in 1985 that only chloracne could be considered a
service-connected effect of exposure to Agent Orange.
   Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the
scientific committee's review of studies on Agent Orange's effects.
But the judge said the standards the VA used in making its rules
violated a 1984 federal law that was supposed to help Vietnam
veterans get health benefits due them.
   Henderson said the VA improperly required proof of a
cause-and-effect relationship between the herbicide and a disease
for which benefits would be granted. Instead, he said, the agency
should have required only that statistics show a significant
correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an
``increased risk of incidence.''
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
comments by members of Congress involved in passing the law showed
they opposed an overly stringent standard and felt cause-and-effect
proof was unnecessary, Henderson said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of the cause, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, Henderson said.
   The judge found a second error in the VA's refusal to apply to
its Agent Orange regulations the same ``benefit-of-the-doubt''
policy it uses for review of individual benefit cases, which favors
the veteran in close questions.
   Although the law's language is unclear, its ``remedial purpose''
favors a lenient standard, Henderson said. Noting that veterans
would be entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual
claims, he said Congress would not have intended to put them in a
worse position through collective regulation.
   Vietnam Veterans of America spokesman Barry Kasinitz said the
group will again sponsor Agent Orange legislation.
   The measure would require Agent Orange benefits for two kinds of
cancer _ soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and to
establish a new scientific panel independent of the VA to study the
herbicide's health effects. The Senate passed a similar bill last
year, but it died in the House, Kasinitz said.

<TEXT>     "Anybody looking at this issue has to conclude that we may be in the same
situation with a whole new generation of veterans in a matter of months," said
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.;    Shortly after the gulf war began, opponents of
government benefits in Agent Orange cases yielded to pressure from veterans'
advocates to expand protection for diseases attributed to the widely used
jungle defoliant, which has been linked to some forms of cancer.;    'Taking a
big step';  "As war rages in the Middle East, we are taking a big step in
putting the Vietnam War behind us," said Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., spokesman
for Vietnam War-era veterans in Congress and a key sponsor of the Agent Orange
legislation.;    The Senate is expected to pass the bill today and send it to
President Bush for his signature. The administration backs the measure, in
part because it codifies into law the standards of the Department of Veterans
Affairs.;    In another action, the House voted 414-0 for changes to the
Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to increase protections for military
reservists called to active duty and others serving in the armed forces.;   
For example, the measure bars evictions of families of military personnel if
the amount of rent owed is less than $1,200, instead of $150 provided under
current law. It also requires automatic reinstatement of health insurance for
those called to active duty and delays civil suits against members of the
armed forces until July 1.;    Permanent benefits;  Under the Agent Orange
legislation, Vietnam veterans who suffer from two forms of cancer --
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma -- would be entitled to
permanent disability benefits for themselves or their survivors. In addition,
those who contracted chloracne, a skin ailment, within one year of their
Vietnam service would be eligible for benefits.;    In a provision that could
significantly expand existing benefits, the bill directs the National Academy
of Sciences to conduct comprehensive reviews of any evidence that Agent Orange
or other toxic chemicals used in Vietnam caused cancer or other diseases in
veterans.;    If the academy recommends payment of disability benefits for a
disease related to exposure to Agent Orange, the Department of Veterans
Affairs must act within 60 days to accept the finding or justify its refusal
to pay compensation in such cases.;    The bill also authorizes federal
funding of as much as $4 million to test dioxin levels in the blood of
veterans who served in Vietnam and who may have been exposed to Agent Orange.
Money for this purpose also must be approved in a separate appropriations
bill, however.  </TEXT>

MUSTO EXPLORATIONS, the Canadian-owned mining group, is in talks with 18
international mining companies on the development of a USDollars
450m-Dollars 500m project in western Argentina.
The company has a one year option to develop what it claims is a world-class
gold and copper deposit in the Andean foothills and is looking for partners
to share development costs.
It is close to completing an 18-month, Dollars 7m feasibility study of the
Bajo de la Alumbrera property for YMAD, a mining company owned by the local
provincial government of Catamarca. Musto intends to take up a one-year
option to develop the project in association with YMAD and international
investors.
If all goes well, the Catamarca mine would be the first major mining
investment in Argentina in decades. Argentina's xenophobic mining laws once
discouraged investment, but in June it introduced new legislation
eliminating investment barriers.
Musto says Bajo de la Alumbrera is 'one of the largest proven unexploited
porphyry copper/gold deposits in South America' and could produce 250m lb of
copper concentrate and 360,000 troy ounces of gold a year for 20 years.
Construction work would take two to three years before the mine could begin
production.
Among companies in talks with Musto are Cyprus, American Barrick Resources,
Placer Dome and RTZ. Musto is also negotiating financial packages with First
Boston and Chase Manhattan banks.
Progress is being held up, however, by negotiations in the Catamarca
legislature over the royalties it will levy on the mine.
The federal government says that 20 local and foreign mining companies are
operating nine mines in Argentina and are considering 64 possible new
projects in which they have already invested Dollars 103m. Officials say
that two of the largest projects should attract investments of Dollars 500m.
Brazil may cut its tin output by 10 per cent next year because of low prices
in the world market, but is in no hurry to join the Association of Tin
Producing Countries, which is co-ordinating producer efforts to reduce world
supply, Mr Samuel Hanan, president of Brazil's mining and construction
company Paranapanema, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Hanan, who was attending an ATPC meeting here, said Brazilian exports
could also fall by 10 per cent in 1994 from 18,500 tonnes in 1993, well
below an export limit of 24,000 agreed with the ATPC.

   I recently read William R. Havender's review (Bookshelf, Nov. 11) of "Dioxin, Agent Orange: The Facts" by Michael Gough. 
Mr. Havender states that, based on the information in this book, my father, Adm. E. R. Zumwalt Jr., need not feel guilt for his son's and grandson's tragic health problems. 

   I agree that my father should not feel guilty about these problems and that only animal studies to date show birth defects. 
However, the conclusion that the evidence of cancer in Vietnam vets from Agent Orange is exceedingly rare and a result from whatever it is that causes these conditions among ordinary Americans of similar age may need to be modified in the light of the most recent scientific study. 
That study, in the Sept. 5 Journal of the American Medical Association, states, "Men exposed to herbicides more than twenty days per year had a sixfold increased risk of NHL (non-Hodgkins lymphoma) . . . relative to nonfarmers." 
A reading of that article and the editorial published with it clearly indicates that a study by the National Cancer Institute demonstrates that Kansas farmers who used 2,4-D, one of the two principal elements in Agent Orange, without protective gear had six times more non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 

   Although Mr. Havender did a fine review of Mr. Gough's book and presented some of the facts regarding Agent Orange, I believe your readers will be interested in the most recent scientific data.

<LEADPARA>  The Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday said Vietnam veterans exposed to
Agent Orange could receive disability benefits for a nerve disease but denied
links between the herbicide and lung cancer. The VA also put off a decision on
whether diabetes is related to Agent Orange exposure, waiting for a National
Academy of Sciences study not expected to be concluded for another year.;   
VA Secretary Edward Derwinski said the proposals "are a mark of progress in
helping to resolve some of the lingering concerns felt by Vietnam veterans and
their families. We are committed to finding as many conclusive answers as we
can." But John Minnick, a spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans of America,
objected to what he called the VA's "piecemeal" approach to Agent
Orange-linked diseases.  </LEADPARA>

PAINT, THE MOST versatile and affordable decorating tool, can be used in 
traditional, contemporary, artful, whimsical or zany applications. Here's a 
comprehensive guide for those who may attempt their own decorative painting on 
walls, ceilings, woodwork or furniture. Each technique is clearly illustrated 
step-by-step in color photographs. What the authors call basic finishes -- 
sponging, mutton clothing, ragging, color washing, combing, spattering -- are 
dealt with first. Then comes information on more advanced techniques -- gesso, 
marbling, porphyry, granite, moire, tortoise shell, wood finishes, wood 
graining, and gold leaf. A glossary further explains terms and techniques.

<LEADPARA>  By a 99-0 vote, the Senate passed legislation Wednesday to provide permanent
disability benefits for Vietnam War veterans suffering from three specific
diseases tied to exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. Administration
officials said earlier this week that President Bush would sign the measure.
The bill, which cleared the House by a 412-0 vote Tuesday, ensures that
veterans who suffer from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and
chloracne, three diseases tied by scientists to Agent Orange, will qualify for
benefits. Payments may be available for victims of other diseases if the
National Academy of Sciences concludes that exposure to the herbicide, a
dioxin-based chemical that was used to thin jungle cover, caused or
contributed to their illness.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Agent Orange measure permanently extends disability benefits to Vietnam
veterans suffering from two types of cancer presumed to be caused by the
herbicide, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.;    Agent Orange
was sprayed by U.S. troops in Vietnam to defoliate jungle cover. For years,
the government refused to recognize a link between the herbicide and these
diseases.;    While some controversy still remains over the effect of Agent
Orange and its primary component, dioxin, the bill came to Bush's desk with
the unanimous approval of both the House and Senate.;    Sponsors of the bill
said Iraq's threat to use chemical and biological weapons against allied
troops contributed to the margin of passage.  </TEXT>

  [Abstract] Research on the reaction of ground water to 
disturbances caused by underground nuclear explosions was 
carried out during the period 1983-1989 using data from 96 
observation holes in the Semipalatinsk test range at distances 
0.3-10 km from the epicenter. The observations were made at the 
time of 44 underground nuclear explosions (29 in deep holes and 
15 in drifts) with a TNT equivalent from 6 to 150 kilotons. A 
change in hydrogeological conditions was caused by a change in 
the mechanical state of the rocks. The greatest change in water 
conductivity was observed in the neighborhood of holes 
containing the least water. In holes penetrating andesitic 
porphyries there was an average increase in water conductivity 
from 0.26 to 0.52 m[.sup]2[/]/day, corresponding to an 
increase in total rock porosity from 3.8 to 5.3%. An 
underground nuclear explosion results in disruption of natural 
hydrogeological conditions in a region with a relative radius 
r/q[.sup]1/3[/] to 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/], which is greater 
by an order of magnitude than the radius of the zone of 
fracturing induced during an explosion and which corresponds to 
the zone of irreversible local disruptions of the medium. 
Changes in hydrogeological conditions were caused by: an 
increase in the effective pressure of the fluid in water-bearing 
rocks; a change in the mechanical, and therefore, the filtration 
properties of reservoir rocks; formation of new filtration 
channels; formation of underground voids as a result of an 
explosion and their subsequent filling with ground water.

<HEAD>Most Vietnam Vets Escaped Heavy Exposure to Dioxin, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans group criticized a new report by the
federal Centers for Disease Control that suggests most Vietnam GIs
escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin, unless they handled
the herbicide Agent Orange.
   ``This study seems to be pretty much the same data that was
released a year ago, only a year ago it was portrayed rather
differently,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for the
35,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America.
   The CDC last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be
determined using military records of troop locations and spraying
of Agent Orange, which contained the deadly poison.
   ``Now ... they are jumping to the conclusion that very few
people were exposed,'' Kasinitz said Thursday in a telephone
interview from Washington. ``That was a bit of a jump in logic that
doesn't seem to be substantiated.''
   The CDC's new report, in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, describes a comparison of blood tests between 646
Vietnam veterans and 97 non-Vietnam veterans.
   ``Current TCDD (dioxin) levels were nearly identical in Vietnam
and non-Vietnam veterans,'' the researchers said.
   The latest study deliberately drew Vietnam veterans from
battalions that had served in areas most heavily sprayed with Agent
Orange around Saigon in 1967 and 1968, the CDC said.
   Only two Vietnam veterans, or 0.3 percent of all 646 tested, had
blood dioxin levels greater than 20 parts per trillion, considered
``clearly elevated,'' the researchers said.
   ``These two men each reported their health status as `excellent'
and did not attribute any health problems to Agent Orange
exposure,'' the researchers added.
   The two men were not among the 14 percent of the Vietnam
veterans in the study group who did link health problems to
exposure.
   ``This study is consistent with other studies and suggests that
most U.S. Army ground troops who served in Vietnam were not heavily
exposed to TCDD (dioxin), except perhaps men whose job involved
handling herbicides,'' the researchers said.
   But Kasinitz said the new report gives the ``unfortunate''
impression that small exposures to dioxin were harmless, which has
not been proven, ``and that there is no need for the government to
act to assist those that have been harmed.''
   Dioxin stays in the bloodstream for many years, and high levels
of the chemical can be measured with blood tests as long as two
decades after someone has been exposed, the researchers said.
   Agent Orange was used as a defoliant in Southeast Asia during
the 1960s by the U.S. military. Some Vietnam veterans contend it
has caused them such health problems as cancer, immune system
disorders and birth defects in their children.
   The U.S. Supreme Court just two months ago cleared the last
legal obstacle to a multimillion-dollar settlement that could
benefit up to 250,000 Vietnam veterans in a class-action lawsuit
against the seven manufacturers of Agent Orange.
   But scientists are still trying to settle a continuing
controversy over exactly what health effects the dioxin in Agent
Orange may have.
   Dioxin is known to be one of the most powerful causes of cancer
in laboratory animals ever tested. It has not been shown to cause
cancer in humans, but the Environmental Protection Agency
classifies it as a probable carcinogen.
