   Archaeologists unearthed a small marble
statue buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., the
first such find in 13 years, newspapers reported Sunday.
   The statue, which depicts a baby boy riding a dolphin, was found
Saturday in the House of the Casti Amanti, near the center of the
abandoned city, Il Mattino of Naples and other papers reprted.
   Archaeologists said the statue was apparently to be used to
decorate a fountain in the house, but that Vesuvius erupted before
workers had a chance to set it in place. Experts said traces of
paint coloring the hair blond and eyebrows black made the find even
more valuable.
   They believe the House of Casti Amanti was owned by a baker, who
lived on one side and kept a shop on the other.
   The last statue to be found in Pompeii was a bronze dug up in
1977.

   Masked gunmen bound and gagged unarmed
guards early Saturday at Herculaneum, a Roman city destroyed when
Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., and stole hundreds of treasures,
news reports said.
   Baldassare Conticello, the superintendent of the archaeological
areas of Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii, said the inventory of the
stolen goods was still incomplete, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.
   The missing items included about 200 gold bracelets and
earrings, a first century bronze vase in the form of a woman's head
and a 32-inch silver-and-copper inlaid bronze statue of Bacchus, he
said.
   At least four bandits wearing ski masks surprised four night
watchmen at their station, AGI quoted investigators as saying. The
custodians were forced at gunpoint to turn over the keys to a
building that houses hundreds of artifacts, the news agency said.
   It said the custodians were tied up and their mouths taped with
bandages. After a few hours, one of the guards was able to free
himself and sounded an alarm.
   Conticello said sale of the stolen goods would be difficult
since they were cataloged. But he said it was possible someone had
commissioned the holdup to enrich a personal collection.
   Walter Mazzitti, the head of Archeoclub of Italy, an
organization of people interested in archaeology, decried what he
called a lack of adequate security at major ruins in the Naples
area and syggested that guards there should be armed.
   Herculaneum, along the Bay of Naples and with the volcano at its
back, included the villas of wealthy ancient Romans. Its ruins,
discovered in 1709, are considered better preserved than those at
the more extensive complex at Pompeii, which was also destroyed by
Mount Vesuvius' eruption.

   An explosion that ripped through a
fireworks factory on the side of the Vesuvius volcano killed two
people, wounded three and produced panic in nearby towns, police
said.
   Monday's explosion was heard up to a half-mile away and the
inhabitants of nearby hamlets thought the volcano was erupting,
authorities said. Several firetrucks and a helicopter arrived from
nearby Naples and doused the flames.
   Police said they did not know the cause of the blast.
   The victims were workers at the factory, which produced
skyrockets.
   Vesuvius last erupted in 1944.

   Naples, Italy -- They call it the Villa of the Chaste
Lovers because, in Pompeii, couples depicted in wall
paintings usually are engaged in more compromising activities
than the exchange of a kiss. Behind a corrugated-iron
partition, locked to keep out the curious, lies the villa,
the only building currently under excavation.
   The rooms of the large three-floor Roman house still are
filled halfway up with crumbling gray ash. On the ground lies
a rusty nail at least 1,900 years old. In what was once a
bedroom, tiny rabbits and birds are delicately painted on the
black and red backgrounds. In the center of each wall, in a
one-square-yard space, the lovers are reclining on their
beds, kissing. Their privacy has not been violated since
these frescoes were buried in 79 A.D. by lava and ash spewing
from Mount Vesuvius all over the towns and villages around
Naples.

   On that blazingly hot dawn in August, what sounded like a
clap of thunder filled the air and the sky seemed to shake.
Mount Vesuvius appeared to split open, and a hail of burning
stones pelted down, followed by ash that filled the eyes,
mouths and lungs of the terrified inhabitants. Within three
hours, the small trading town was completely buried under hot
ash. Very few people escaped, out of a population estimated
at 20,000. Still today, one quarter of the 27-acre site is
buried and may remain so for many years. This is not so much
a pity as a saving grace. As long as the houses stay
blanketed in ash, they are safe from the combined damage
caused by weather, weeds, wanderers and vandals.
   "Pompeii is dying," says Baldassare Conticello, the
Palermo-born archaeologist who has directed operations at the
site for the past five years. "I'm engaged in a battle of
wits against time and the various Italian ministries."
   Time is the more insidious foe. When the tougher surface
of the wall paintings starts to thin out, the brick-based
pigment blows away like dust.
   As for the state, Mr. Conticello says between cigar puffs,
he spends his days trying to extract money from it: "The
Ministry of Cultural Heritage only gets 0.19% of the
country's total annual budget and, out of those two billion
lira a year {$1.6 million}, Pompeii gets only a fraction."
Mr. Conticello estimates that, ideally, Pompeii would need at
least 500 billion lira {$406 million} to save it from
disaster. He may be far from that goal, but he hasn't lost
the fight, he says. "I wouldn't be here if I thought that.
I'm 57 years old and I'm not going to call myself a loser
yet."
   Mr. Conticello lives with his wife and small daughter in
an apartment on the edge of the site, working a 12-hour day
to keep the city alive. He doesn't like Naples, and would
rather live in Rome, but he plans to stay. He recently
managed to get a 35 billion lira {$28.4 million} sum out of
the government, and with it, he intends to restore the
buildings, pavements and streets from the Amphitheatre at the
east of the town to the Forum at the west.
   As the most recent in a dynasty of archaeologists
inaugurated in 1748 by an abbot from Naples who began digging
near the Temple of Fortune, Mr. Conticello wants to use the
latest scientific methods to restore the site and present the
clearest possible picture of the thriving port city as it
stood. "Most of my colleagues dream of the past in terms of
romantic ruins. I'm much more pragmatic. I like jet planes
and modern architecture. I want to rebuild the houses just
enough to save them, but no more than that. Every time you
work on an ancient site you damage it, and the gamble is to
work out how much you can damage in order to restore."
   With assistance from IBM and Fiat, and a subsidy from the
Ministry of Labor, Mr. Conticello has been making a
computerized graphic database of Pompeii over the past two
years. First 160,000 square feet of paintings were digitized.
Then, the 105 archaeologists working on the project, and
various computer experts, cartographers and architects,
turned their attention to the 8,800 papyrus scrolls
discovered in Pompeii, now in the Natural History Library of
Naples. After photography, the gray-on-black lettering was
tinted purple and magnified to make it easier to read.
   Such computer models enable restorers to experiment
without fear of damaging the real work. On the site, however,
the workers as often as possible use stone and mortar, wood
and terra-cotta tiles, just as the ancient Romans did.
Earlier restoration techniques using reinforced concrete to
bolster walls and cement to restore paintings were "far too
brutal." The most urgent task, Mr. Conticello believes, is
roofing. "You can't understand architecture if the roofs
aren't there." In the areas near the Amphitheatre and in
Porta Marina near the Forum the roofs are painstakingly being
rebuilt with wooden beams and, whenever possible, the
original tiles.
   The sidewalks and streets have been worn down by the feet
of the two million tourists who tramp through Pompeii every
year. Using another ancient method, Mr. Conticello and his
team are rebuilding the sidewalks with "ciccio pisto", a
mixture of crushed terra cotta, mortar and volcanic stone.
"It acts as a sealant, protecting the houses from the
humidity that seeps up from the ground."
   Pompeii, as Mr. Conticello sees it, is not to be a
melancholy vision of ruins by Piranesi. He wants the Roman
houses to give visitors some impression of the community that
once lived here and to re-create the former border lines
between houses and gardens. With a botanist who is studying
the pollen and seeds as they were when trapped under the ash
on the day of the eruption, he can re-create the gardens
exactly as they were 19 centuries ago. They already have
replanted several gardens with vineyards and beds of violets
and roses.
   Mr. Conticello, who thinks of himself as an
archaeologist-cum-manager, has sworn that all the money gets
from the Italian state will go into restoration. But he would
love to start new digs in Pompeii or Herculaneum, the other
site nearby that was buried under lava, not ash. It covered
most of the ancient town under what is now many feet of hard
rock.
   Mr. Conticello is eager to create an international
foundation of businesspeople that would raise the money to
carry out the digs. "A single villa could yield more than 100
statues," he says. "Just imagine the prestige. We could build
a museum, something like the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation in
Venice."
   Nowadays, when the night starts to fall, a wailing siren
warns visitors that it's time to leave Pompeii. They don't
need to be urged, says one of the 200 guards who patrols the
grounds. "For those who don't know it, Pompeii is scary at
night. They're afraid of ghosts."
   But the living still are very much the masters of Pompeii.
Two men from the small modern village of Pompeii just beyond
the walls amble in and out of the ruins, cutting tender,
edible dandelion leaves with their pen knives, stuffing them
into plastic bags, and singing a Neapolitan love song at the
top of their lungs.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cookson in east European venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, is forming a joint
venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply the central and
east European markets with special refractories and systems used in the
steel continuous casting process.
The joint venture agreement involves Vesuvius International, Cookson's
Belgium-based subsidiary and Dolomitwerke Wulfrath, a Thyssen subsidiary.
Vesuvius will hold a 75 per cent stake in the new joint venture while
Wulfrath will hold the balance.
Both partners will inject their shares in their own existing east European
joint venture companies - Vesuvius Czechoslovakia Trinec and Ceramika
Wulfrath Skawina - into the new company. The local Czech and Polish partners
in the existing joint ventures will remain shareholders.
Mr Stephen Howard, chief executive in charge of Cookson's group corporate
development and chief executive of the Vesuvius division, said the joint
venture would enable both Cookson and Thyssen to lessen the risk involved in
eastern Europe and to establish a closer working relationship.
The central and eastern European markets represent annual steel production
of about 170m tons with German production representing about 30 per cent of
this.
The joint venture will initially have sales of between Pounds 25m and Pounds
30m a year, but turnover and profits are expected to grow quickly as the
switch to continuously cast steel production takes place.

   Volcanoes killed more people in the '80s
than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near
their slopes, a geologist says.
   ``We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the
world,'' said Robert Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who
coordinated the agency's response to the Mount St. Helens eruption.
   ``Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively
reliable. We just don't do enough of it.''
   Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows
_ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation,
Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000
people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows
_ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from Mexico's El Chichon in
1982, Tilling said. Mount St. Helens left 57 people dead or missing.
   In 1902, pyroclastic flows killed 29,000 near Mount Pelee in
Martinique, 6,000 near Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala, and 1,560
in the eruption of Soufriere on St. Vincent, said Tilling, who is
based in Washington, D.C.
   His count shows 13,080 more died during the six other deadly
eruptions this century: three volcanoes in 1951 and three others in
1911, 1919 and 1963.
   An average of 50 of Earth's 600 volcanoes erupt each year, most
without fatalities, and the rate ``has not changed much in
historical times. But because the world population has exploded ...
to 5 billion in 1987, the problem posed by volcanic and associated
hazards is greater now than ever before,'' he said.
   He said more than 350 millon people live on or within danger
range of volcanoes _ about 14 percent of the population.
   ``We spend a lot of effort at a few volcanoes _ and we need to,''
Tilling said in an interview. ``But we're not applying existing
(monitoring) technology to more volcanoes, especially in developing
countries where the risks and hazards are the greatest.''
   And, he said, the most dangerous volcanoes are the least studied.
   Part of the problem, Tilling said, is that volcanoes erupt
infrequently compared with natural hazards such as earthquakes,
major storms, floods and landslides.
   ``However in populated areas, even very small eruptions can wreak
havoc and cause widespread devastation'' such as the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption.
   The mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as Mount St.
Helens' May 18, 1980, explosion. But the tiny Colombian eruption
melted glacial ice, burying Armero and other towns under mudflows,
he said.
   Tilling urged an international effort to reduce volcano deaths.
The National Academy of Science and United Nations previously have
endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated
the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction.
   To reduce volcano deaths, scientists must identify high-risk
mountains, study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur
and whether the eruptions were explosive, map the routes of killer
flows to identify danger zones, then install monitoring equipment
where necessary to listen for earthquakes, uplift and tilting, and
other signs of activity.
   Asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring,
Tilling replied: ``There's the question.''
   Tilling said the 10 most deadly eruptions since A.D. 1000 were:
   _Tambora, Indonesia, 1815, 92,000 deaths, including 80,000 from
starvation.
   _Krakatau, Indonesia, 1883, 36,420 killed by tsunamis, or
volcanic tidal waves.
   _Mount Pelee, Martinique, 1902, 29,000 dead.
   _Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia, 1985, at least 22,000.
   _Vesuvius, Italy, 1631, 18,000 killed.
   _Unzen, Japan, 1792, 15,190 tsunami deaths.
   _Etna, Italy, 1169, 15,000 fatalities.
   _Kelut, Indonesia, 1586, 10,000 killed.
   _Etna again in 1669, 10,000 more victims.
   _Lakagigar, Iceland, 1783, 9,340 lives lost.

MEASURING the temperature of molten steel manually is dangerous and costly,
so Vesuvius International, part of Cookson, the international industrial
materials group, has developed a new long-life sensor which can measure the
temperature of molten steel up to 1,8000C for more than 300 hours at a time.
'Steel companies throughout the world are trying to improve the quality of
their steel,'said Wolfgang Loser, president of the German-based Accumetrix
division of Vesuvius.
'Our sensors will monitor the whole process, tell them second by second what
the temperature is and guarantee they produce the best quality steel.'
The new long life sensor, manufactured by the Accumetrix plant in Beaver
Falls,Pennsylvania, is made out of platinum and rhodium and can measure the
temperature of more than 18,000 tons of molten steel being cast at the rate
of six tons a minute.
Vesuvius is also working on a new range of sensors, the size of a walking
stick, which will measure the sulphur, hydrogen,oxygen, phosphor and
nitrogen content of steel.

<TEXT>
   Italy's minister of culture says he won't approve
construction of a four-lane highway adjacent to Pompeii's famous
ruins and across the ancient city's unexcavated necropolis.
   Carlo Vizzini, whose ministry protects and preserves
archaeological sites, said Thursday that ``in no case'' will he
approve a project ``that not only edges, but minimally touches''
excavations at Pompeii.
   Some members of Pompeii's city government proposed reducing
traffic congestion in the modern city by linking two existing
highways with a new one streching a little more than a mile along
the famous tourist attraction.
   Opponents argue the exhaust and viabrations will damage the
ancient stones, and that the highway will prevent excavation of
Roman archaeological treasures in the necropolis.
   The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried the city of
Pompeii.
   Guiseppe Galasso, a member of Parliament from the town of
Pozzuoli in the shadow of the volcano, calls the highway proposal
``the kiss of death'' for the ruins.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Kaufman tells ITV chiefs of bleak future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV COMPANIES are living 'everyday life in Pompeii before Vesuvius erupts',
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP, warned yesterday.
He told Yorkshire-Tyne Tees executives that the future looked bleak when the
rules governing ownership of television companies were relaxed to allow
hostile takeovers.
Chairing a Commons national heritage committee inquiry into the BBC's
future, Mr Kaufman said ITV companies needed to face reality.
'We are talking about minnows being swept away in a tidal wave,' said the
former shadow foreign secretary.
He suggested that ITV companies should merge with the BBC and turn
themselves into software suppliers of programmes for the new age of
broadcasting which he said was just around the corner.
Currently, ITV chiefs are only dealing in millions of pounds when huge
multi-media foreign organisations are talking in terms of billions in
overseas sales, he added.
'And the overseas rivals will oust British companies on their own territory
unless they face reality,' he said.
'We are already seeing 11 per cent of the British TV audience belonging to
Mr (Rupert) Murdoch and that is before Mr Murdoch has got going and that is
before the technological revolution has arrived.'
Mr Kaufman foresaw a reasonable future for the BBC and ITV only into the
early part of the next century - after that, he predicted, their audi-ence
levels would plummet.
'It is not a question of competing in the outside world, it is competing to
keep any kind of audience in this country when the new regime arrives,' he
said.
Giving evidence, Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman and chief
executive, said he refuted Mr Kaufman's volcano analogy.
'We are aware that Vesuvius might be erupting and we want to get ourselves
organised in a planned and proper way and not be running around like scalded
cats frightened about what is going to happen,' he said.
Mr Leach asked for the moratorium, which blocks foreign takeovers of ITV
companies and which is due to end in January, to be extended.

<LEADPARA>  ONE of the problems that parents face in trying to provide reinforcement and
enrichment for the lessons their children learn in school is that some of
those lessons deal with facts and theories that simply were not taught just a
few years ago.;    So parents must keep an eye out for ways to refresh their
own knowledge, and I try to make Family Learning a part of that process
whenever possible by sketching out a useful area of study and then providing
information about low-cost and no-cost learning materials that are appropriate
for use in the home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I am reminded this week of a theory in geology called "plate tectonics"
(tek-TAHN-iks), which was discussed only by scientists just a couple of
decades ago and now is taught in elementary and middle schools across the
country. This theory comes to mind right now because it helps explain an event
that happened just 11 years ago this week -- May 18, 1980 -- the eruption of
the Washington volcano known as Mount St. Helens.;    Historical value;    The
volcanoes we studied in school were consigned, for the most part, to history
classes, and, to be sure, there is a great deal of history to be learned from
them. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius (vuh-SOO-vee-us) in southern Italy in
A.D. 79, for example, caught the people in the nearby city of Pompeii
(pom-PAY) so much by surprise that many died where they stood, and the tons of
ash and rock that covered the city preserved it for nearly 1,700 years, giving
us our most accurate information about Roman life of that time.;    And this
Roman foundation to our knowledge of volcanoes was particularly important
because there are so many things that are associated with volcanoes that have
a Roman origin or connection. The word "volcano" itself derives from the Roman
god Vulcan, who was the blacksmith for the gods and who labored at his forge
deep inside a fiery mountain. The word "eruption" comes from the Latin word
meaning "to break out or explode," and "crater" is the Latin word for "bowl.";
   Lessons for today;    We didn't think of volcanoes and earthquakes as being
part of our time in history or our place on the planet. The Earth to us was
truly solid ground, or in the Latin phrase "terra firma." But today our
children are learning that that ground is anything but solid, and that
volcanoes and earthquakes are just the most violent outcomes of the slow,
constant and measurable drift of the Earth beneath our feet.;    The theory of
plate tectonics says that the surface of the Earth, its 50-mile-thick crust,
is broken into several large, shifting slabs. Some of these slabs or plates
bump into each other, some pull away from each other, and some slide by each
other.;    It is at the edges or boundaries of these plates, then, that molten
rock from deep inside the Earth can find its way to the surface. The Earth is
constantly reconstructing itself, and that is why the word "tectonics"
applies. It pertains to "building or construction" and is derived from the
Greek word for "carpenter.";    Map available;    The best visual display of
plate tectonics I have seen is a large (58- by 41-inch) map of the Earth that
plots all the major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have occurred
throughout history. These marks on the map occur all along the various plate
boundaries and form a stunning outline of the pieces in the Earth's fractured
crust. The map, titled "This Dynamic Planet," costs $3 (plus $1 for handling)
and is ideal for a classroom or bedroom wall.;    Send a check or money order
to U.S. Geological Survey, Box 25286, Federal Center Building 41, Denver
80225. I suggest you request the rolled (rather than folded) version of the
map. There is also a free, 45-page pamphlet that the USGS has produced
explaining volcanoes and plate tectonics, which can be obtained by calling
1-(800) USA-MAPS and asking for the pamphlet titled "Volcanoes."  </TEXT>

FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Set free from its tomb of lava - Susan Moore on an
exhibition which opened in London this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE morning of August 24 in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Pliny the
Younger, living in nearby Misenum, left a harrowing account of the awful
darkness that 'came rolling over the land after us like a torrent'.
Hit by showers of volcanic debris, earthquakes and asphyxiating gases,
Pompeii, together with Oplontis and Stabiae to the east, were submerged
under pumice-stone and ash. To the west, Herculaneum was engulfed by
volcanic mud that solidified to form a stone cover 10 metres thick.
These provincial coastal towns and cities of the Roman empire were
transfixed in the first century. They remained more or less undisturbed
until 1709 when a chance discovery in Herculaneum prompted the Bourbon kings
of Naples to start excavations to recover antique sculpture to adorn their
palaces.
When Goethe visited Pompeii and Herculaneum, the passages dug by the Bourbon
miners could be explored by lamplight, and the discoveries made there were
fuelling neo-classicism. Goethe wrote in 1787: 'Many a calamity has happened
in the world, but never one that has caused so much entertainment to
posterity as this one.'
Archaeological research, restoration and maintenance at the Vesuvian sites
had been in decline since the 1950s. Walls were crumbling and wall paintings
deteriorating. The sites would have deteriorated further if an earthquake in
1980 had not jolted the Italian government into action.
In 1981, an special archaeological administration was instituted for the
Pompeii area. By 1984, it had substantial - although still insufficient -
funds and an energetic soprintendente in Professor Baldassare Conticello. He
has masterminded what he describes as a new philosophy for Pompeii; it
involves the collaboration of archaeologists, geologists, biologists,
botanists, geotechnicians, physicists and even a climatologist.
The bonus of computer expertise came when IBM Italy and Fiat Engineering
joined forces in 1987-89 to form the Neapolis consortium. It transformed the
project by setting up one of the largest ever information technology systems
for archaeology, to address the task of preserving, restoring and
interpreting Pompeii.
First, the whole 140 square-mile area was electronically mapped, to produce
a grid on to which other data could be added. That information included over
12,000 catalogue entries of individual finds, and over 8,700 digitised
colour images of wall paintings, mosaics and artefacts - thus preserving,
electronically at least, Pompeii's most fugitive and precious treasures for
posterity. Excavation notebooks dating back to 1862 were committed to disk
and, like the Herculaneum papyri, made more legible on the computer screen
in the process.
Imaging techniques were developed to simulate restoration of damaged wall
paintings, allowing restorers to experiment without touching the frescoes
themselves. Data on the function of each building has shed light on
Pompeii's ancient social, political, religious and commercial life. At the
touch of a button, the computer reveals, for example, the existence and
whereabouts of a red light district, the distribution of shops and
workshops, or even take-aways.
On site meanwhile, Conticello inaugurated a systematic restoration of
Pompeii from east to west, further excavations and a new museum. A series of
publications, exhibitions and concerts raised awareness of the area and
brought more visitors and, with them, public funding. Publishing the finds
has also protected them. The entire collection of bronze and gold stolen
from the deposit at Herculaneum in 1990 was recovered last November, because
thieves were unable to find a buyer.
The most ambitious and critical consciousness-raising exercise to date is
the spectacular travelling exhibition, 'Rediscovering Pompeii'. It comes at
a time when digging has stopped and the computer is silent, awaiting a
second phase of funding. The show features 200 treasures and artefacts -
some only recently brought to light - and demonstrates the role of the
Neapolis technology in making the classical world more accessible. After
showing at New York, Houston (where is attracted over 350,000 visitors) and
Malmo, it opened in London at the Accademia Italiana this week.
Ironically, the disaster that totally extinguished life in two days and two
nights in the first century also ensured a kind of immortality. Voices
resound in streets, houses, baths and open public spaces. Graffiti and
inscriptions record sporting triumphs and forthcoming fights, political
propaganda, and fierce expressions of love, hate and undying friendship.
Casts made from the cavities left by the fugitive Pompeiians make for
chilling death masks.
Most poignant are those of a family found sheltering in its home. Recently
excavated just outside Pompeii's city walls, they show a man raised up on
his elbow to shoulder the roof timber that has fallen, cupping his hands to
cover the nose and mouth of his pregnant wife beside him.
In the exhibition, we find the highly defined contours of a lady from
Oplontis who took flight clutching a purse full of coins, rings and gems.
That little purse, and other items such as bone dice, a bronze colander,
bowls of carbonised olives, figs and prunes, speak as eloquently as any fine
marble, bronze or mosaic.
A surprising amount survives of gardens as well as houses. Botanists working
on the recent excavation of the House of the Chaste Lovers at Pompeii have
been able to determine the precise layout and planting (through pollens,
seeds and roots) of its formal inner garden. In time this will be
reconstructed; meanwhile a larger programme of replanting is under way. The
Pompeiian love of greenery is most vividly apparent in the enchanting
frescos of a recently excavated garden room that form the centrepiece of the
show, richly adorned with luxuriant naturalistic flora and fauna.
Pompeii was a thriving commercial city. Oplontis and Herculaneum, in
contrast, were graced by the villas of the rich. The former boasts the only
surviving ancient wooden furniture (patterned by elaborate geometric
marquetry), and the fine wall painting at the supremely elegant villa
thought to have belonged to Nero's second wife Poppea. A sequence of
open-air rooms, frescoed with abundant foliage and lined with flower beds,
eases the transition between garden and house.
The garden of Herculaneum's grand Villa of the Stags has supplied much of
the finest marble statuary in the show. Its 'Drunken Hercules' is
characteristic in its robust earthiness. This Hercules is no conventional
hero. He is portrayed peeing, legs spread wide in a desperate attempt to
remain vertical.
'Rediscovering Pompeii', Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, London SW7,
until June 21. Sponsored by IBM UK.

VOLCANO LOCKED MAYAN SETTLEMENT IN A TIME CAPSULE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: FOR EXCITED INVESTIGATORS, THE 1,400-YEAR-OLD CIVILIZATION IS A 
POMPEII IN EL SALVADOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a June evening 1,400 years ago, a volcano suddenly erupted in what is now El 
Salvador and sealed an entire prehistoric settlement in a time capsule, 
complete with the dirty dishes of a civilization that flourished 600 years 
before Columbus arrived in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
Buried beneath 15 feet of volcanic ash and extensively excavated for the first 
time last summer, the houses of the village of El Ceren are preserved in such 
exceptional condition that archeologists say the dwellings and their contents 
are as nearly intact as Pompeii, the Greco-Roman city buried by the eruption of 
Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. 
</P>
<P>
"No other site in the New World has domestic architecture so well preserved," 
said Paul Amaroli, an archeologist at Vanderbilt University who has visited El 
Ceren. "It's hard to wear out superlatives on this site." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement over El Ceren stems from the fact that although monumental 
architecture such as Mayan temples and Aztec tombs are abundant in the area, 
well-preserved households of the peasants and commoners who built the 
ceremonial cities and carried out commerce and farming are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Even more precious are dwellings that have been preserved with the clutter of 
everyday life -- the garden tools, the pots and jars, even the dead ducks in 
the courtyard -- found in the same locations as they were that day 1,400 years 
ago when the volcano exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"They lived better than we had pictured them," said Payson Sheets, an 
archeologist from the University of Colorado in Boulder who is leading the 
excavation of El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize now that their domestic adobe architecture was much more 
sophisticated than we thought. The structures sit on big, fired platforms. 
They'd be dry even during the rainy season. The roofs were substantial. These 
were not people living crowded and huddled in a mud hut. Even their poorest 
houses were better than much of the rural houses in El Salvador today. They 
really seemed to be fairly well off." 
</P>
<P>
In El Ceren, ceramic pots were found tucked into adobe niches where they were 
placed by the occupants. A digging stick leans against a doorway. A wooden 
pestle rests in a stone mortar. Enigmatic graffiti are still visible in one 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Two metates, the flat stones used for grinding flour, were discovered still 
resting on the forked wooden posts that supported them in use. Sharp obsidian 
knives, some with food residue still clinging to the blades, are wedged into 
the thatched roof, placed as if to be safely out of reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
And what may turn out to be the only book, or codex, as archeologists call 
them, to survive was found in a small cubbyhole beside three painted pots and 
an oyster shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Other codices survive from Mesoamerica, but they were all squirreled away 
someplace, hidden, and then ended up in collections. None of the codices are 
attached to a context. We don't know where they're from or who used them. . . . 
Here we have a book from an agricultural setting," said Harriet Beaubien, an 
expert in the conservation of antiquities at the Smithsonian Institution who is 
trying to preserve the painted codex found in a block of ash at El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan settlement of El Ceren was inadvertently uncovered by a bulldozer 
helping to construct grain storage silos in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets was in El Salvador, working at another site, and heard about the 
discovery of "recent houses" found under 15 feet of volcanic ash. Sheets said 
he expected the houses to be a hundred years old at the most. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a trowel and went looking for Coke bottles, pieces of tin, plastic 
wrappers -- something that would date the structures," Sheets said. "Instead, I 
found a prehistoric pot. Well, I thought, these people must have had an 
interest in prehistory. I still didn't know what I was dealing with. Then I 
started finding more pots and I took some thatch samples for radiocarbon 
dating." 
</P>
<P>
Radiocarbon analysis of the thatch dated the structure about AD 600. Sheets was 
immediately intrigued, but even though he received funding from the National 
Science Foundation to begin excavating the site, he said he did not think it 
was safe to bring colleagues and students to El Salvador, which was then in the 
midst of a civil war. Sheets did not return to work in El Salvador until last 
summer, when the first extensive excavations were begun. 
</P>
<P>
El Ceren was buried when a vein of basaltic magma from the nearby Laguna 
Caldera Volcano came into contact with water from Rio Sucio. The combination of 
super-hot magma and water created steam explosions that blasted clouds of hot 
steam and ash toward El Ceren, a village of still unknown size. The rain of hot 
ash sealed the village within a volcanic cast. 
</P>
<P>
To date, three extended households have been excavated, along with outbuildings 
and storerooms. Nearby were furrowed fields with rows of short, young corn 
stalks along each little ridge, leading Sheets to guess that the volcano 
erupted in June. The fact that objects like digging sticks and cooking pots 
were put away makes Sheets suspect that the eruption occurred at night. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Miller, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano 
Observatory who has studied the site, said he thinks there were several 
eruptions and ground shaking caused by volcanic earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the eruptions began, it would be hard to get away. With the fall of ash, 
it would be pitch black. The hot surges would be very lethal. The temperatures 
of the clouds would at least be boiling," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"There'd be hot, moist ash with larger chunks of rock sailing along or falling 
out of the sky. People would be scalded, their lungs would burn and they'd 
probably die of asphyxiation." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, and with some disappointment, Sheets said that no human remains have 
been found in El Ceren. Residents who watched the bulldozer find the first 
household report seeing human bones and described shapes that might have been 
body casts. 
</P>
<P>
They have disappeared. Sheets expects further digging to reveal remains in one 
of the several structures still not fully excavated, or in a household yet to 
be found.

   Today is Wednesday, Aug. 24, the 237th day of 1988. There are
129 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Aug. 24, A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted,
burying the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic
ash. An estimated 20,000 people died.
   On this date:
   In A.D. 410, Rome was overrun by the Visigoths, an event that
symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
   In 1572, the slaughter of French Protestants at the hands of
Catholics began in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The killings
lasted until October, and claimed some 13,000 victims.
   In 1814, British forces invaded Washington and proceeded to set
fire to the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a
non-stop flight across the United States, traveling from Los
Angeles to Newark, N.J., in just over 19 hours.
   In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression
pact.
   In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty went into effect, with the
parties agreeing that an armed attack against one would be
considered ``an attack against them all.''
   In 1954, the Communist Control Act went into effect, virtually
outlawing the Communist Party in the United States.
   In 1959, Hiram L. Fong was sworn in as the first
Chinese-American U.S. senator while Daniel K. Inouye was sworn in
as the first Japanese-American in the U.S. House of
Representatives. Both were from Hawaii.
   In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power as
it exploded a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific.
   In 1970, a bomb planted by anti-war extremists exploded at the
University of Wisconsin's Army Math Research Center in Madison,
killing 33-year-old researcher Robert Fassnacht.
   In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20
years to life in prison for the shooting death of rock star John
Lennon.
   In 1982, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin was installed as head of
Chicago's Roman Catholic Archdiocese.
   Ten years ago: Leftist guerrillas who had seized the National
Palace in Managua, Nicaragua, released the last of their hostages
after the government freed 59 political prisoners and paid a
ransom. The guerrillas and the former prisoners were flown to
Panama.
   Five years ago: Corazon Aquino, widow of Philippine opposition
leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr., returned to her homeland for her
husband's funeral, rejecting President Ferdinand E. Marcos' denial
that his government had any part in Aquino's assassination.
   One year ago: A military jury in Quantico, Va., sentenced Marine
Sgt. Clayton Lonetree to 30 years in prison for disclosing U.S.
secrets to the Soviet Union.
   Today's birthdays: TV personality Durward Kirby is 76. TV host
Dennis James is 71. Boxer Gerry Cooney is 32. Actor Steve
Guttenberg is 30. All-star shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. is 28.
   Thought for today: ``Nothing has really happened until it has
been recorded.'' _ Virginia Woolf, English author and critic
(1882-1941).

Armed robbers stole at least 200 ancient Roman gold artifacts from a storehouse 
in the excavation site at Herculaneum, a popular tourist center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two robbers climbed over the gates, tied up six guards and with the 
help of other robbers they let into the site, escaped with sacks full of gold 
bracelets, earrings and other trinkets dating from the 1st Century. 
Herculaneum, along with Pompeii, nine miles south of Naples, was an ancient 
Roman city engulfed by ashes and debris from an eruption of the Vesuvius 
volcano in AD 79. Museum officials said the stolen artifacts are irreplaceable 
and therefore priceless, but would be difficult to sell.

   Today is Thursday, Aug. 24, the 236th day of 1989. There are 129
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Aug. 24, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union
signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, each country pledging not to
``associate itself with any other grouping of powers which directly
or indirectly is aimed at the other party.''
   On this date:
   In A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the
Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic ash. An
estimated 20,000 people died.
   In A.D. 410, Rome was overrun by the Visigoths, an event that
symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
   In 1572, the slaughter of French Protestants at the hands of
Catholics began in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The killings
lasted until October, and claimed some 13,000 victims.
   In 1814, British forces invaded Washington, D.C., and proceeded
to set fire to the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a
non-stop flight across the United States, traveling from Los
Angeles to Newark, N.J., in just over 19 hours.
   In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty went into effect, with the
parties agreeing that an armed attack against one would be
considered ``an attack against them all.''
   In 1954, the Communist Control Act went into effect, virtually
outlawing the Communist Party in the United States.
   In 1959, three days after Hawaiian statehood, Hiram L. Fong was
sworn in as the first Chinese-American U.S. senator while Daniel K.
Inouye was sworn in as the first Japanese-American in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
   In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power as
it exploded a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific.
   In 1970, a bomb planted by anti-war extremists exploded at the
University of Wisconsin's Army Math Research Center in Madison,
killing 33-year-old researcher Robert Fassnacht.
   In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20
years to life in prison for the shooting death of rock star John
Lennon.
   In 1982, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin was installed as head of
Chicago's Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   Ten years ago: A 73-hour stand-off began at New York's Kennedy
International Airport as U.S. officials prevented the takeoff of an
Aeroflot jetliner until they could determine whether Soviet
ballerina Lyudmila Vlasova was returning home voluntarily after the
defection to the United States of her husband, dancer Alexander
Godunov. (Vlasova was ultimately allowed to leave.)
   Five years ago: On the heels of the Republican convention,
Democrat Walter F. Mondale said the proceedings had demonstrated
that President Ronald Reagan represented the party of the rich,
while Reagan questioned Mondale's commitment to a strong defense.
   One year ago: Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
picked up the endorsement of the AFL-CIO while Republican nominee
George Bush campaigned in California with President Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: TV personality Durward Kirby is 77. TV host
Dennis James is 72. Former secretary of education Shirley
Hufstedler is 64. Boxer Gerry Cooney is 33. Actor Steve Guttenberg
is 31. All-star shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. is 29.
   Thought for today: ``Posterity is as likely to be wrong as
anybody else.'' _Heywood Broun, American journalist and author
(1888-1939).

As the tall ships headed down the Tyne this weekend to race to Bergen, they
passed a send-off party thrown by a company claiming to be the only one that
plied its trade by sail from Newcastle which is still operating there.
Mind you, it very nearly wasn't, admitted Cookson Group's American chief
executive Richard Oster, recalling 1990 when the industrially-diversifed
caboodle almost sank. Nor does he ascribe its recovery primarily to the new
managers who have taken the helm.
When they decided to go for a one-for-four rights issue earlier in the year,
he confided, they were a bit anxious about the outcome of an already
arranged shareholders' visit to the plant of their Vesuvius ceramics
subsidiary at Newmilns near Glasgow.
They became more anxious still when not only did institutional investors and
others representing more than half of the stock ownership turn up, but
Vesuvius's UK chief Roger Brook blithely informed the visitors that nobody
from management would be showing them round the plant. Instead they were
divided into small groups and given a tour by shopfloor workers.
The moral was plain, Oster said. The rights issue was 96.3 per cent taken
up, and the rest of the shares readily sold. 'The workers did a better job
than the likes of me could have done,' added Brook.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cookson cuts borrowings by another Pounds
18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson, the industrial materials group, has announced a co-ordinated series
of acquisitions and disposals affecting its business supplying the European
steel industry.
Net proceeds from the four deals will be Pounds 18m.
The announcement follows the group's successful Pounds 82.8m rights issue,
which it said on Friday was 96 per cent taken up by shareholders. The
combined effect of the rights and the recent deals will be to reduce
Cookson's net borrowings from Pounds 330m to Pounds 230m.
Gearing, which was above 100 per cent when the group suffered a crisis of
confidence last autumn, will fall to 35 per cent.
Most important of the deals is the Pounds 23.7m sale of Cookson Plibrico
International to ILVA, the Italian state-owned steel group. Plibrico makes
furnace linings for steelworks and made operating profits of Pounds 2.9m
last year.
The other deals, which are worth less than Pounds 5m each, include the
acquisition by Cookson of Metacon, a private Swiss company which designs
slide gates for steel casting, and two acquisitions by Vesuvius Italia, an
existing joint venture of ILVA and Cookson.

<LEADPARA>  This date doesn't mean much today, but it was a bad one for the ancient
Romans. On Aug. 24, A.D. 79, Mount Vesuvius, which hadn't so much as hiccuped
in centuries, blew its top and buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. And later, in
the year 410, Alaric the Visigoth answered the double dealing of the emperor
by overrunning Rome. The Visigoths spent three days symbolically putting an
end to the Western Roman Empire by killing the people, looting the buildings
and generally tearing up the city. But being good Christians, they didn't lay
so much as a finger on the churches.  </LEADPARA>

Millionaire oilman J. Paul Getty in 1954 purchased a large ranch-style home on 
65 acres in Malibu, in which he opened a museum to display art objects he had 
been collecting. As his collection grew, Getty built a new museum, designed as 
a reconstruction of a Roman seaside villa that was buried in an eruption of Mt. 
Vesuvius in AD 79. Completed in 1974, the museum contains 38 galleries of art, 
including antiquities from Greece and Rome, as well as Renaissance and Baroque 
paintings and French decorative arts.

THE VOLCANO LOVER by Susan Sontag Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 419 pages
FATHERS AND CROWS by William T.  Vollmann Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 990
pages
THE PROMISE OF LIGHT by Paul Watkins Faber Pounds 14.99, 218 pages
IN A time when so many novelists are raiding the history books for subject
matter, you would have hoped that at least Susan Sontag, a writer
unsurpassed at tackling the major cultural questions of our time, would use
a foray into fiction to take an incisive look at the way we live now. No
such luck. Her third novel, The Volcano Lover, is a rich, intelligent,
historical romance that turns out to be little more than a prolonged
meditation on dormant themes.
The novel, set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tells the story of
Sir William Hamilton, his wife Emma and her lover Lord Nelson. Sir William
is the effete English ambassador to Naples whose main interests lie in
collecting art and studying Mount Vesuvius, active during his tenure in
Italy. After the death of his first wife he marries Emma Hart, a beautiful
yet coarse woman who in turn falls in love with Nelson, fresh from his
victories over Napoleon on the Nile.
I read the book in the hope that at some point it would erupt into
significance, that it would shed the quaint fabric of historical romance to
assume a more timely garb. But Sontag plays it pretty straight throughout,
using her skill to examine the political turmoil, aesthetic obsessions and
emotional dilemmas facing her largely frivolous characters.
It is a lively and erudite read, though nothing distinguishes it from the
glut of other recent novels that seem to grow more out of assiduous research
than any attempt to unravel the tangled knot of our times.
Another writer who has made good use of his library card is William T.
Vollmann. At 32, Vollmann stands as a living reproach to slothful young
writers everywhere, having already published something like 5,000 pages of
fiction. Fathers and Crows is the second in his seven-volume fictional
history of North America. It deals with the French Jesuits' conquest of
Canada and its indigenous population in the 17th century, giving us tales of
a continent's worth of priests, explorers and native people, most
interestingly one Catherine Tekakwitha, an Algonquin convert beatified by
John Paul II in 1980.
There is no doubting that Vollmann has a brain the size of Saskatchewan, and
that he is not afraid to have fun with history. He also possesses a
narrative skill that surfaces on occasion amid the welter of detail. But, in
the end, the book proves too dense a forest for the casual walker to find
his way through. The central narrative is complicated by numerous
geographical and temporal digressions, as well as enough personal and place
names to fill a phone book and an atlas. Strictly for the reader with a
specialist interest in the history of Canada, or those possessing a
Jesuitical temperament.
Another chasteningly productive young writer is 28-year-old Paul Watkins.
His fourth novel, The Promise of Light, is, like his earlier work, a
coming-of-age story cloaked in the guise of an adventure yarn. Set in 1921,
it follows young Ben Sheridan as he travels from his native Rhode Island to
Ireland after learning that the couple who raised him were not his real
parents. As he searches for his true identity he soon finds himself enmeshed
in the horrors of the Civil War, eventually forced to fight with the IRA
against the Black and Tans. As in all Watkins's work, the hero is forced to
undergo a bloody rite of passage before his true nature can be revealed.
Watkins's writing is as terse and lively as ever, employing a precision that
is often cinematic, particularly in the combat scenes. Unfortunately, the
story itself is somewhat predictable and superficial, draining the taut
prose of much of its narrative drive. One gets the feeling both Ben's and
Ireland's searches for selfhood are little more than pegs upon which the
author hangs daring midnight raids and heroic slogs across the bogs. And the
ending is informed more by the ethos of the B-Movie than serious fiction.
Watkins is a talented writer who should perhaps think of changing to a less
frenetic gear.

   The would-be novels began badly and
turned worse before their first sentences thudded to an end,
laughable tributes to a once popular Victorian master of banality
and gratuitous polysyllabic prose.
   And those were the winners!
   The 8th International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, sponsored
by the San Jose State University English department, unleashed its,
uh, best entries Thursday from ``the seamy underside of
literature.''
   The grand prize from the nearly 10,000 execrable entries from
around the world went to Ray C. Gainey of Indianapolis for this bit
of amusing, albeit repulsive, imagery:
   ``Professor Frobisher couldn't believe he had missed seeing it
for so long _ it was, after all, right there under his nose _ but
in all his years of research into the intricate and mysterious ways
of the universe, he had never noticed that the freckles on his
upper lip, just below and to the left of the nostril, partially
hidden until now by the hairy mole he had just removed a week
before, exactly matched the pattern of the stars in the Pleiades,
down to the angry red zit that had just popped up where he and his
colleagues had only today discovered an exploding nova.''
   For his effort, Gainey gained a word processor, confirming the
computer age adage, ``Garbage in, garbage out.''
   ``My wife was jumping up and down when she called me at work,''
said Gainey in a telephone interview. ``They dragged me out of a
meeting. I thought somebody was dead.''
   Gainey, who enters as many as 30 items a year, said he won
dishonorable mentions in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   The contest, founded by English professor Scott Rice, honors, as
it were, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton.
   Rice describes Lytton as the ``author of some of Victorian
literature's most turgid prose'' and notes that the ponderous,
meandering opening sentence to his novel, ``Paul Clifford,'' which
began, ``It was a dark and stormy night ...'' inspired not only the
contest but the famous literary beagle, Snoopy.
   The contest, which Rice calls ``a sneaky but enjoyable way to
encourage writing,'' invites insipid inkslingers to offer opening
sentences to the worst possible hypothetical novels.
   ``As anyone who has spent time on an entry knows, it takes a
good writer to write bad deliberately,'' Rice says.
   Here, then, are some of the deliberately bad winners, the creme
da dreck, in various genres:
   Detective Fiction _ ``Sgt. Tom Katt wasn't 100 percent sure of
anything but he knew something wasn't quite right when the factory
foreman told him that the nightshift guard had fallen into a vat of
baby oil and softened to death.'' _ Wayne D. Worthey, Washington,
D.C.
   Historical _ ```Rumbling, Schmumbling!' retorted Bulonius to his
wife's alarm at the sounds coming from Mt. Vesuvius, `that stupid
volcano always makes noise _ and besides, our insurance agent at
Pompeii Mutual says that if it does erupt we'll be covered.''' _
John L. Ashman, Houston.
   Vile Puns _ ``As Wilbur, long obsessed though unfamiliar with
pointilism, escorted his wife, Katy, into the Modern wing of the
local art museum, he exclaimed jubilantly, `Kay, Seurat!, Seurat!,'
to which she replied, yawningly, `Whatever, Wilby, Wilby.' '' _
Matthew Kaslow, Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Western _ ``Sheriff Blalock groped for his shooting iron, as the
thought that he was up for re-election crossed his mind, because he
wasn't going to let this varmint get away with insulting Miss
Beulah's girls, even if they did kind of resemble a string of
horses that had been rode hard and put away wet.'' _ Lucile R.
Addington, Dallas.
   Romance _ ``Jake liked his women the way he liked his kiwi
fruit: sweet yet tart, firm-fleshed yet yielding to the touch, and
covered with short brown fuzzy hair.'' _ Gretchen Schmidt, Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Adventure _ ``It was the third day of the Iditarod sled race,
and a frigid wind blew ice crystals into Preston's grizzled,
windburned face as he urged his dogs on: `Mush! Let's go, Jason,
Jennifer, Jeremy! Move it out, Chelsea, Brian! Come on, Buffy,
Muffy! Mush!'' _ Michael J. Saxton, Davis, Calif.

   A 19th-century painting set in ancient Rome of a
young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $153,450 _
nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $8.
   ``It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but
that isn't unique in art,'' said Sotheby's Simon Taylor after the
sale Tuesday of ``Diadumene'' by Sir Edward Poynter.
   The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for
once-neglected Victorian works. It had estimated the painting would
fetch up to $232,500.
   Poynter, in 1885, had painted the young woman nude but he added
diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the Royal Academy of
Arts and provoked letters from shocked viewers.
   One letter to the press, signed ``British Matron,'' said the
writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition.
Another letter said the painting would produce a ``burning sense of
shame'' in any ``modest woman on the arm of father, brother or
lover.''
   Poynter was known for such paintings but his most famous work,
reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day, was ``Faithful unto
Death.'' It depicted a Roman sentry staying at his post during the
destruction of Pompeii by the Vesuvius volcano.
   The seller and buyer of ``Diadumene'' were not identified.
   The painting had been auctioned in 1956 at a sale of the contents
of Ashley Manor, owned by Lady Agnes Chichester Dixon-Hartland.
   Top price at Tuesday's auction of 19th century European art was
$2.3 million _ more than double the estimate _ paid anonymously for
``Grandfather's Birthday,'' a family fireside scene by Austrian
artist Ferdinand Georg Waldmueller. It was a record for his work.

<TEXT>
   Six stolen artworks discovered a year ago hidden in the Paris home of an Italian have been returned to Italy, the Cultural Ministry announced yesterday. 

   A 15th-century triptych by Gabriele di Francesco was among the works. 
The painting, in three side-by-side panels, was stolen in 1985 from the altar of the Cathedral of Roniglione, 33 miles north of Rome. 

   A 15th-century painting by Francesco Raibolini, three 17th-century compasses with ivory cases, and Francesco Netti's 1800 "Procession of Penance During the 1794 Eruption of Vesuvius" also were recovered. 
They were stolen from Italy between June 1983 and August 1984. 

   The Italian news, ANSA, said the works were found in the home of Giambattista Ongaro. 
It quoted ministry officials as saying several other works that had been exported illegally from Italy also were found in the home. 

   No charges were filed against Mr. Ongaro. 
The ministry said there is no evidence to link him to the thefts.

<TEXT>UNDATED: gilt-edged investment.    Since the mayor of Thebes got
written up in hieroglyphics for ripping off a royal tomb in the reign of
Ramses IX, around 1130 B.C., the past has been up for grabs.    Alexander
the Great, Hannibal and Julius Caesar loaded the spoils of conquest onto
ox carts. Viking raiders plundered the Irish monasteries. Pompeii slept
for 1,800 years under the volcanic ash of Vesuvius until rediscovery brought
renewed destruction by Bourbon kings, Napoleon, the Nazis, liberating British
and American armies, and now tour buses.    Enrico Dandolo, the 82-year-old
blind doge of Venice, diverted the Fourth Crusade from the Holy Land to
Constantinople, and while the city burned, made off with the four exquisite
bronze horses adorning the hippodrome. The pious Venetian had a stone Bible
inserted beneath the paws of the winged Byzantine lion that now stands
in the piazetta as a shrine to St. Mark, patron of the city.    Along
came Napoleon, bent on making Paris the art center of the world, and
the gilt horses were set to pulling a victory chariot atop the Arc du Caroussel
outside the Louvre until a righteous Austrian emperor returned them to
Venice _not to Constantinople or the Isle of Rhodes from whence they were
originally hijacked.    Spanish conquistadors obliterated Aztec temples
in search of El Dorado. Nazi invaders filled railway cars with European
art for avid collectors Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, whose tastes
ran to plump renaissance nudes. Soviet technicians building the Aswan Dam
sent home scarabs and other pharaonic souvenirs in diplomatic pouches.
   French intellectual Andre Malraux was convicted of loading up a riverboat
with Cambodian temple idols and roof ornaments. The Americans followed
the French example in ransacking the Annamite and Cham monuments of Vietnam,
just as the Khmer Rouge, then the Vietnamese army, further ruined the ruins
of Angkor Wat.    Tomb robbing has been illegal since the first-century
reign of Emperor Vespasian, but every 30 minutes somewhere in Italy
a work of art vanishes into collections abroad.    But of all the displaced
art in history none has stirred such deep emotions or as many debates in
the House of Commons as Lord Elgin's marbles.    In 1801, while serving
as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, then ruling Greece, the Scottish
peer got permission from the sultan to collect the numerous sculptures
he saw being destroyed daily.    For Thomas Bruce, no good ever came of
his rescue mission. The first boatload went down at sea, and a considerable
part of his fortune went to divers hired to retrieve it. Just married,
he dreamed of marble halls for the family seat at Broomhall, Scotland.
Nearly bankrupt, he wound up selling the exquisite statues and columns
to the British Museum for about $160,000, less than half the cost of removing
them from the Parthenon.    ``Poor plunder from a bleeding land,'' lamented
Lord Byron, who denounced Bruce as a jackal, an idiot and a greedy ``stone
shop'' keeper.    But on first looking into a showcase of Elgin
treasures, John Keats poured forth his ``Ode on a Grecian Urn.''    The
seventh earl's marriage ended in an ugly divorce. A rare skin disease ate
away the tip of his nose. On his way home, he was taken hostage for three
years in the Napoleonic wars, nver resumed his diplomatic career and eventually
lost his seat in the House of Lords. Posterity provided the final calamity.
``Elginism'' became a synonym for rip-off adventures.    The art world,
however, is still divided over whether he ravished the glory that was Greece
or preserved it from Athenian neglect, Turkish cannons, traffic pollution,
airport vibrations and relentless invasion by tourists.    ``The damage
by tourists has been terrible,'' says fellow Scot Graham. ``There is absolutely
no justification for returning the Elgin marbles. Lord Elgin was not motivated
by profit like today's greedy collectors. Surely by now some statute of
limitations must apply.''    But Karl Meyer, author of ``The Plundered
Past,'' a fascinating study of the international traffic in stolen art,
said in an interview, ``The Elgin marbles are inseparably integral to Greek
culture.''    In his mind, the Parthenon, where Socrates taught young
Plato, and Pericles encouraged Phidias to sculpt those colossal statues
of the gods, and Alexander the Great piled his captured shields, ``stands
at the very summit of Greek achievement. There is no other case like it
in the world.''    Curator Peter Lacovera at Boston's Fine Arts Museum
differs: ``The British Museum has every right in the world to hang onto
the Elgin marbles, which otherwise wouldn't exist today.'' If returned,
he suggests the British government bill Greece for 173 years of storage
and maintenance.    In the intrigue-haunted world of antiquities, you
can never predict what will happen to the past.

<HEAD>Wright's Stuff: Industrial Artist Gets 1st Major Show 200 Years
After Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One artist grasped the importance of what was
happening in England in the 18th century when he chose scientific
demonstrations, iron forges and blacksmiths' shops for his
``peculiar'' subjects.
   Joseph Wright's first major show in London, opening today, comes
almost 200 years after his death.
   ``He deserved one before but this often happens in England,''
said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, at Tuesday's
preview.
   To avoid confusion with artists of the same name, Wright was
known in his lifetime as Wright of Derby, the Midlands town where
he was born and worked. He died in 1797 and the title has stuck
ever since.
   His most famous picture is of a group of people watching a
demonstrator pump air from a glass globe, causing a bird inside to
flutter in distress as it loses oxygen. The viewers react in
fascination or shock and one covers her eyes.
   A critic who saw it in 1768 wrote: ``Mr. Wright, of Derby, is a
very great and uncommon genius, in a peculiar way.''
   In those days, ``peculiar'' meant ``individual'' or ``unlike
others,'' says the exhibition organizer, Judy Egerton, who has
gathered about 200 works from around the world for the show.
   Two years earlier, Wright had shown another unique painting, of
a lecturer explaining the workings of an orrery, a clockwork model
of the solar system. His listeners, including two little boys, are
entranced and one man makes notes.
   There are no pictures like these anywhere else, art historians
say.
   The scene in each painting is illuminated by a candle lamp,
demonstrating Wright's mastery of light effects. His industrial
pictures show workers lit by the fires at which they work metals.
   Wright's scientific and industrial paintings won for him the
honor of being the first artist to directly express the spirit of
the industrial revolution.
   He was gripped by fire and light and returning in 1775 from a
visit to Italy he brought his paintings of the annual firework
display in Rome, the Girandola, and of a nighttime eruption of the
Vesuvius volcano.
   All these are in the Tate show along with many of the portraits,
by which Wright earned the bulk of his income.
   ``Wright fell into obscurity in the 19th century but in the
1920s he was appreciated by American collectors,'' Serota said.
   His paintings then rose in value. In 1984, London's National
Gallery paid $1.7 million at auction for his portrait, ``Mr. and
Mrs. Coltman.''
   Wright had charged Coltman 63 pounds for it in 1771, then the
equivalent of about $300.
   The ``Wright of Derby'' exhibition goes to Paris this summer and
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in the fall, the
first time the Tate has loaned a show to the Met, Serota added.
   ``Wright captures the excitement of scientific discovery,'' said
David Fraser, curator of Derby's museums.
   Derby Art Gallery has the largest collection of Wright's work
because its residents admired him and contributed in Victorian
times to the museum's purchase of his paintings.
   In the 1960s, the Derby church he was buried in was demolished
and its site now lies under a beltway. His remains were so
carelessly reburied in a local cemetery that no one now quite knows
where they are, the curator said.
   The exhibition is at the Tate Gallery through April 22, at the
Paris Grand Palais May 17 through July 23 and at the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art Sept. 6 through Dec. 2.

   ``Look at this! Think how frightened she must
have been,'' Rita Lowe exclaimed, trying to imagine her Italian
immigrant mother's awe on entering the cavernous registry room on
Ellis Island in 1907.
   ``Can you imagine, coming from a small village?'' she commented.
   Mrs. Lowe, 67, of Long Beach, Calif., was among the 371 people
who took the first ferry from Battery Park on lower Manhattan
across the harbor Monday for the first day that the ``portal to the
New World'' was reopened to the public as a museum celebrating
American immigrants.
   ``We came to be sure we were here this first day,'' said Mrs.
Lowe, who walked the halls of the restored building with relatives,
remembering her mother's tales.
   ``Coming from a small town, women were modest and the physical
embarrassed her. I can understand but she couldn't. She often spoke
of those first days here and would say to me: `I was healthy, not
sick. Why did they have to examine me that way?' ''
   ``We have to keep this place alive,'' Mrs. Lowe said. ``In
memory of her and for all those reasons why she came here, her and
all the others.''
   Laima Silaikis Hood, 50, of New York, came to the United States
from Lithuania in 1949. She didn't enter through Ellis Island, but
an uncle of hers had in 1910.
   ``The significance for me, being an immigrant _ a refugee _ is
that I can identify with those who came before,'' she said,
standing before photo murals and a display of century-old
immigrants' trunks, valises and baskets in the Baggage Room, a
great hall at the front entrance of the museum.
   The building contains a variety of exhibits on three levels,
many depicting what the incoming millions and their adopted country
were like when they got here.
   Patricia Sandler was enthralled with the display of immigrant
artifacts and said she wished she had thought to contribute an
heirloom from her grandparents, John and Maria DeSimone. They
passed through Ellis Island from Naples, Italy, in 1907.
   ``They had lived near Mount Vesuvius, and when it erupted they
had copper pots they put over their heads to protect them from
falling stones.
   ``We've had those pots all these years, things they kept in
steamer trunks as mementos,'' Mrs. Sandler said.
   Theodore Heretakis, 55, went straight from the ferry to the
island's seawall to scan the Wall of Honor. Among the 200,000 names
inscribed in copper he found the name of his father, Stavros, and
his father-in-law, Pantelis Gigourtakis, who came from Crete in the
1920s.
   ``I marvel at the achievement of all the immigrants,'' said
Heretakis, an engineer who lives in Commack. ``They all demonstrate
what our parents had, the hard work and aspiration.''
   Jerry Khlumsky, 48, of New York, said his grandfather, Joseph,
settled in Chicago in the 1890s after arriving in New York from
Prague, in what is now Czechoslovakia.
   ``I feel very close and yet there's a gap,'' Khlumsky said. ``I
feel a kinship with eastern Europe and this is sort of a meeting
place between here and there.''
   ``I can't believe people had the guts to leave and come where
they had no idea what they were coming to,'' said Jennifer
Wechsler, 18, of Los Angeles, who took in the museum with her
mother Judy on the last day of a visit in the city.
   Barbara Viborka, 54, of New York, reminiscing at the seawall,
said her parents came from Czechoslovakia, arriving in separate
ships.
   ``Growing up I heard about the trip all the time,'' she said.
``They never told me about the bad. They made a joke of it.
   ``Mother was just coming for a visit to see a cousin and go back
home. She was 16. But she was seasick 14 days and she said she
decided when she got here, `God put me on land and that's where I'm
staying.' ''

<HL> To Mark Year 2000, Some Events Will Be Out of This World --- Fears of Apocalypse Spark Plans for Rescue by Blimp; A Big Bash at the Pyramid </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ann Hagedorn (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Busy, busy, busy. 
So much work, so little time. 
Richard Kieninger is racing to assemble a fleet of blimps to rescue hundreds from the major earthquakes he believes will rumble across the globe on May 5, 2000. 

   His fleet will float serenely over the hurly-burly until calm is restored, which he figures will take two weeks. 
Then, he and his followers will land and start a brave new world like the one they now inhabit: Adelphi, Texas, the Town That Lives by the Golden Rule. 

   "Sounds kind of far out," Mr. Kieninger concedes cheerfully, "but it's wise to prepare. 
Some people could be driven mad just due to the terror of it." 

   You think that's weird? 
Think again. 
He's not alone. 

   The imminent arrival of the new millennium is just now beginning to dawn on the collective consciousness. 
While most of us have trouble trying to schedule a lunch date for next week, some folks are making plans already for the year 2000. 
Not all of them see a looming doomsday. 
Some see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for putting on the glitz. 

   One group has booked the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Egypt for a monumental bash on the eve of the new millennium. 
Some 1,750 revelers will travel in high style on the Queen Elizabeth II. 
The itinerary includes a stop in Marseille to load the cargo hold with cases of champagne that the French Champagne Growers Association has agreed to donate. 

   Comedian George Burns is planning to attend the black-tie affair -- with a date (he'll be 103). 
So are Deng Xiaoping and baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, according to the founder of the Millennium Society, Edward McNally, a lawyer in New York. 
Mr. McNally says Pope John Paul II has acknowledged the invitation but apparently hasn't decided yet whether to attend. 

   Then there are those who are more interested in the commercial possibilities of the new millennium. 
Twentieth Century Fox has registered a new corporate name: Twenty-First Century Fox. 
Publishers are filling bookstores with a raft of new titles on the topic by astrologers and other assorted soothsayers. 

   Lever Bros., the consumer-products giant, is test-marketing a new soap called Lever 2000 in Atlanta. 
An employee says the name initially was chosen in part because it was thought to suggest "a breakthrough in soap technology." 
But the suds-of-the-future concept apparently didn't go over big. 
So Lever 2000 now is being promoted as a soap designed to clean the body's "2000 parts." 

   "Soon, every major company will use it for some kind of promotion," Alvin Toffler, the author of "Future Shock," predicts. 
"And by the year 2020, there 'll be a whole new industry built on remembering the year 2000." 

   That kind of unwary optimism is alarming to disaster theorists like Mr. Kieninger, who frets that the world won't awaken in time to the imminent peril. 
He and his followers believe that a massive buildup of ice on the South Pole will force a catastrophic shift in the Earth's axis. 
In their view, the buildup will trigger a series of earthquakes, tidal waves and volcanic eruptions beginning in the mid-1990s. 

   Disaster theorists believe the earthquakes will reach a climax on May 5, 2000, when Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn become aligned with the Earth and the sun. 
"Office towers . . . would rock, flinging people around inside like rag dolls," writes Jeffrey Goodman in the last chapter ("Coping With Reality") of his book "We Are the Earthquake Generation." 

   By that time, Mr. Kieninger says confidently, he and his followers will be safely airlifted off the surface of the planet. 
So far, he says, 250 have reserved seats on the blimps, which will take off from sites in Texas, Illinois and an island in the South Seas. 

   Mr. Kieninger says he expects thousands more to seek refuge as the catastrophe nears. 
But that's no problem, he says. 
"We'll sleep in shifts." 

   Publishers are beginning to cash in on the burgeoning fears of an apocalypse. 
They're bringing out a spate of new books on Nostradamus, a prophet of the 16th century, who predicted an apocalyptic end for the world around the year 2000. 
Video stores in New York and California report waiting lists of up to three months to rent a film on the prophet narrated by Orson Welles. 

   Such fears aren't unusual, historians say. 
Toward the end of any century, says historian Hillel Schwartz, "there is always a sense of things falling apart." 

   Michael Barkun, a history professor at Syracuse University, agrees. 
In his paper "Apocalypse Chic: Waiting for the Year 2000," Mr. Barkun says a period of "nervous anticipation" typically precedes years ending in zeros. 
The more zeros, he says, the greater the anticipation. 

   All kinds of happenings will take on an exaggerated significance as harbingers of the future, Mr. Barkun says. 
He predicts the year 2000 will be a "lightning rod for people's anxiety about the future." 

   Robert Lerner, a history professor at Northwestern University, says the period before the year 1000 was characterized by "a jitteriness, a sense that the time was right for strange, portentous things to happen." 

   Legend has it that Europeans, fearing the end of the world, fled to the hills to await the Second Coming in the year 1000. 
The few remaining chronicles of the period suggest that little actually happened. 

   Seven years before the turn of the millennium, "Mount Vesuvius gaped far more often as is his wont and belched a multitude of vast stones," Radulphus Glaber, a monk of the Benedictine Order, wrote in 1005. 
Despite the ominous augury, the year turned out to be a real yawner. 
Otto III, the Holy Roman Emperor, dug up the bones of Charlemagne to remind his subjects of the empire's past glories. 
That was about it for excitement. 

   After the turn of the millennium, "there was a great sense of relief," says Mr. Lerner. 
Church building boomed. 
The monk Radulphus Glaber wrote that it was "as though the very world had shaken herself and cast off her old age and were clothing herself everywhere in a white garment of churches." 

   Mr. McNally and his Millennium Society are planning a more secular celebration. 
The group, which started planning its bash in 1979, currently has 3,500 members. 
If permitted, the group plans to stage events at 23 places around the world. 

   The celebration will begin in New Zealand, which lies just west of the International Date Line and will be among the first places in the world to enter the new millennium. 

   The group hopes to stage other celebrations at the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge, the Statue of Liberty, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Grand Canyon. 
With 12 more years to plan, Mr. McNally is dreaming even bigger dreams. 
"It may even embrace flights of the Concorde chasing midnight," he says.

<HEAD>Measuring Earthquakes, From Chinese Dragon Bowls to Laser Precision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today sensitive instruments detect every tiny
movement of the earth's crust, recording in detail disastrous
earthquakes like the one in Northern California on Tuesday.
   These geological tools represent the ultimate refinement in a
line that began almost 2,000 years ago with the ancient dragon bowl
that dropped a ball when shaken.
   The first earthquake recording device was credited to the
Chinese philosopher Chang Heng in the year 132.
   He developed a bowl with dragon-shaped heads located at eight
points around the outside. Each had a small ball balanced in its
mouth; during an earthquake the ball dropped out, landing in the
mouth of a toad statue located below.
   The location of a quake was supposed to determine which dragon
dropped its ball, and the instrument was said to have recorded a
quake 400 miles away that could not be felt by people near the bowl.
   J. de la Haute Feuille developed a similar device to record
quakes in the year 1703, filling his bowl to the brim with mercury.
In a quake, some mercury would spill on the side toward the quake.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the U.S. Geological
Survey, said that in modern measuring devices, instruments near the
center of an earthquake are knocked off their recording scale in a
violent temblor, but readings can be calculated from the waves
reaching more distant machines.
   Agency scientists at Menlo Park, Calif., near the site of
Tuesday's deadly quake, are now collecting all available
information on what happened.
   The basic tool today is a seismograph, an instrument developed
in the late 19th century.
   Basically, it is a box with a frame attached to the ground that
includes a suspended weight, which is able to swing. When an
earthquake causes the frame to move, inertia forces the mass to lag
behind and its swing is recorded by a pen and ink sweeping back and
forth over paper. That pen trace is the commonly shown seismogram.
   These machines can be set for vertical or horizontal shaking and
in modern machines the shaking produces an electrical signal which
is amplified to drive a pen, allowing them to be much more
sensitive than in the past.
   Over the years scientists have learned that earthquakes produce
more than one type of wave, and that the different kinds move
through the earth's crust at different speeds.
   By comparing the time of arrival of the different wave forms at
a seismograph, scientists can determine how far away a quake
occurred. Comparing the results at several locations allows them to
calculate the exact position of the quake.
   While these are still the primary instruments used to measure
quakes, geologists also have developed an array of other machines.
   For example, Russ pointed out that in parts of California along
the San Andreas fault, laser beams are used to measure land
movement.
   The laser is placed on a hill and shines on a target located on
the other side of a fault. Regular flashes of light allow the
scientist to compare the time it takes for the light to travel
between the two spots and thus calculate whether the light and
target are moving relative to one another.
   Other instruments buried in the earth can sense the stresses
placed on rocks. Measurements are also made of radon and other
gases released by the earth and sensitive meters can even trace
changes in the strength of gravity beneath the spots where they are
located.
   A pendulum was first used to record a quake in Naples in 1731,
with Nichomas Cirillo reporting that the amplitude of the swing
decreased with distance from the quakes.
   Using a magnifier trained at the image of a cross hair, focused
on a bowl of mercury, Robert Mallet was able to measure the speed
of waves in the earth following dynamite explosions in England in
1851.
   Luigi Palmieri installed a seismograph at Mount Vesuvius in
1856, but the instruments were brought into general use toward the
end of that century by a group of British geologists headed by John
Milne, working in Japan.
   Milne eventually managed to get seismograph stations set up
around the world, collecting data at a central observatory for
analysis.

   A fog-cloaked Mount St. Helens slumbered
through the 10th anniversary of its devastating eruption Friday but
scientists warned that it could awaken with a vengeance.
   The southwest Washington volcano killed 57 people and turned
verdant forests into an eerie lunar-style landscape in its May 18,
1980, eruption. And there is a ``high probability'' of another
major blast within the next 50 or 60 years, said geologist Dwight
Crandell.
   That eruption could have six times the force of the 1980 blast,
which had the power of a 24-megaton nuclear warhead or 2,500
Hiroshima bombs, he said. Crandell, now retired, co-wrote a 1978
government report that predicted the 1980 eruption.
   St. Helens is the peak in the Cascade mountains most likely to
erupt soon, but other volcanoes in the range should be watched
closely, said Tom Pierson, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver. The Cascades run
from northern California to southern British Columbia.
   Pierson said Mount Baker and Mount Rainier in Washington State,
Oregon's Mount Hood and California's Mount Shasta show some signs
of activity, such as minor steam eruptions and bulging. He termed
Rainier ``perhaps the most dangerous volcano in the Cascades''
because of its potential for destruction of a huge area of Puget
Sound lowland.
   None of the scientists said how far in the future such eruptions
might be.
   The volcano experts and government officials headlined a ``Ten
Years Later'' conference that attracted 250 scientists from across
the country.
   The 1980 eruption must serve as a warning to prepare for
inevitable volcanic disasters ahead, the scientists said.
   Better monitoring and early warning techniques must be
developed, smarter land use planning adopted and citizens must stop
building in the likely path of mudflows and flooding that eruptions
will generate, the experts said.
   Pierson noted the 21,000 deaths when a Colombian village was
wiped out by a volcano a few years ago and said population centers
are flourishing in the likely paths of flooding and mudflows from
American volcanoes.
   St. Helens is quiet now but scientists don't know how long the
calm will last, Crandell said.
   The mountain is being monitored in an unprecedented degree and
``almost certainly there will be a warning'' before another major
eruption, Crandell said.
   ``We are learning things that can be applied elsewhere,'' such
as the precursor earthquakes and bulging of the volcano flanks, he
said.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanoes were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting but something that happened somewhere
else,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano hazards for the
USGS.
   Wildlife biologists, foresters and other experts told the
conference the habitat, wildlife and vegetation around St. Helens
have rebounded in a stunning fashion. Virtually every species
devastated by the eruption has come back, they said.
   A helicopter tour of the area dramatized both the destruction
and the recovery. Though snow, rain and sleet obscured the peak
itself Friday, other signs of the eruption were evident _ barren
hillsides still caked knee-deep with gray-brown ash, giant trees
strewn like matchsticks, new river beds riding atop broad mudflow
plains and newly configured lakes.
   The swath of destruction cut by the flow of volcanic material
and shock waves traveling the speed of sound contrasts with the
lush stands of timber that survived.
   But renewal is obvious too. Herds of elk graze on vegetation on
steep slopes near the mountain and trees replanted in the volcanic
ash are growing sturdily, some of them already 30 feet tall. Rivers
and lakes boast good fish runs. A new highway is being punched
through spectacular terrain. Hiking trails abound.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Carving out a drama in the courtroom - Sore about its
treatment by the UK government, the Getty is determined to win possession of
the Three Graces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today the never-ending saga of the Three Graces moves into the courtroom. A
judge will decide whether the complaint by the Getty Museum of Malibu,
California, that the British Government has broken its own rules on the
export of works of art, has substance.
It is amazing it has come to this. The Getty, the most generously endowed
museum in the world, with a Dollars 4bn bequest from oil billionaire J. Paul
Getty to administer, has always prided itself on playing fair, on not using
its financial muscle to rampage through the treasure troves of nations.
It expects governments to play fair too. But having waited since 1989 to
take possession of Canova's statue, which it bought for Pounds 7.6m, and
confident that the August deadline postponing its export from the UK would
be the last, the Getty is up in arms at the unexpected delay. This enabled
Timothy Clifford of the National Galleries of Scotland to ride belatedly to
the rescue and unearth two rich friends of the UK, John Paul Getty II and
Baron Thyssen, who have promised Pounds 1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively
to save the Three Graces for the UK.
No wonder the Getty's mild mannered director John Walsh is roused. 'We have
been treated shabbily,' he said. 'The government has changed its own rules
and ignored its own deadlines whenever it was convenient. What's at issue is
not just the Three Graces: it is the fair administration of the export
review system in Britain.'
Few objects of art more suit the Getty than the Three Graces. Getty loved
antiquity. His museum is fashioned after a Roman villa which disappeared on
the eruption of Vesuvius. Canova's fantasy of the daughters of Jove
embracing in marble harks directly back to classical times.
A visit to the Getty on its hillside perch confirms that the Three Graces
would fit beautifully into an airy alcove there, alongside statues, framed
by the fountains, shrubs and frescoes of the museum and with the Pacific
Ocean in the distance. The likely loss of the statue has put iron into
Walsh's soul. It is not the first time the Getty has been pipped at the
post. A Duccio painting and a Bernini bust were also retained in the UK
thanks to the Clifford-Getty II partnership.
Despite an annual expenditure budget in excess of Dollars 200m, the Getty
Trust, which administers the museum, has traditionally behaved prudently.
'We have not used our cheque book to pay over the odds, nor have we hidden
behind false identities,' says Walsh. The trust has played the game,
respecting the national heritages of the European countries which mainly
hold the objects of art it seeks. 'We only succeed in acquiring about one
object in every four or five that we would like,' says Walsh. In the future
this restraint in spending the Dollars 60m or so a year the museum sets
aside for acquisitions may be loosened.
Apart from the increasingly restrictive export policies for antiques
operated by European Union nations, the Getty imposes its own checks on
acquisitions. It respects the passions of its founder, who mainly bought
antiquities, Renaissance and Baroque paintings and European decorative arts.
Its collection does not contain anything made after 1900, its painting
display culminating in a selection of dramatic works by Ensor, Munch and,
most notably, Van Gogh - a version of 'Irises' which at more than Dollars
40m was the Getty's most expensive single acquisition.
The 1900 time limit is unlikely to change, though Walsh has cast off some of
the self-imposed limitations: there is little point having so much potential
buying power if you do not try to form the finest collections in the world
in certain fields.
So the Getty has focused on photography. Its collection of more than 60,000
images, from Fox Talbot to American 20th-century greats such as Weston -
Walsh says a photography archive stopping at 1900 is a nonsense - is
considered the ultimate. Selective collections of drawings and manuscripts
have also been assembled.
But to the visitor the eye catchers are in the traditional areas: the
antiquities, purged of the rogue fake; the paintings, from Rembrandt to
David and including the most expensive Old Master ever acquired at auction -
Pontormo's portrait of Cosimo de Medici, which cost Dollars 35m in 1989; and
the panelled rooms displaying an ornate procession of French design, from
Regence through Rococo to Neo-Classical.
By 1997 a new museum, built atop a nearby hill with views across Los
Angeles, will open.
Called the Getty Center, it will cost Dollars 700m and be four times larger
than the villa, which will remain the home of the antiquities.
The rest of the collection, including many objects currently warehoused,
will move into a museum campus designed by Richard Meier. It is the
construction of the new museum which is absorbing most of the Getty's
invested revenues, though there are still millions to spare each year for
conservation projects and scholarship.
Although running two museums plus satellite activities will increase the
operating costs of the Getty Trust, the completion of the Center will leave
more money to spend. The Getty will want some fine objects to fill its new
galleries but it is finding it ever harder to acquire them. Walsh admits
this is a growing problem. Most of the pre-1900 masterpieces are safely
ensconced in museums worldwide.
The Getty can, however, make private deals: it recently acquired a very fine
Tiepolo through Switzerland. In spite of Walsh's protestations it certainly
pays top prices. Perhaps Turner's dramatic seascape 'Von Tromp doing the
will of his Master' is just about worth the Dollars 17m the Getty paid, but
other recent payouts, such as Pounds 4.95m for a Goya bull fighting scene
and Dollars 11m for a Sebastiano portrait of Pope Clement VII, look on the
high side.
These paintings were bought openly. The worry is that, affronted by the
delays and the dubious justifications of the UK government over the Three
Graces, the Getty will be inclined to go behind backs and negotiate
privately with British aristocrats, German princes, and French counts.
At the moment the art market is still suffering from post-recession blues
and little of unquestionable brilliance is coming forward. In a year or two
the Getty, with its bulging pockets, will be ready to power the market's
revival, while at the same time showing less sensitivity to national pride.

The Bourbons used to make their regal entry into Naples by sea. So did
Admiral Nelson in search of Lady Hamilton. It is, to this day, also the most
convenient way to reach the heart of Naples.
The heads of the G7 countries will, however, arrive by air for their meeting
this week. This is, yes, more in tune with the times, but air travel misses
the sweep of the Bay of Naples with the volcanic cone of Vesuvius in the
background.
Unfortunately, most people's impressions of Naples are coloured by negative
experiences within minutes of setting foot at its airport or two railway
stations. This is unfortunate because Naples is unquestionably the grandest,
if not also the most maligned and most chaotic, of the great Mediterranean
port cities. Naples and the Neapolitans deserve a second, even a third,
chance.
The airport ordeal begins even before landing, as the aircraft navigates a
perilous path between illegally built apartment blocks and the tops of
ancient chemical plants that ring the runway. Then comes the wait for
baggage which has a habit of losing itself. Be quick to report luggage that
does not arrive: I was once allowed to search the holds of five parked
aircraft and, eventually, located the lost piece about to be dispatched to
Bari.
Luggage in hand, it is best to opt for a taxi. The cardinal rule about
Naples taxis - who consider any passenger, especially one from out of town,
fair game - is always to check the meter works and is clocked on. This is
particularly adviseable for the journey to central Naples, which takes at
least 45 minutes.
Here is a fairly standard routine between passenger and driver: 'Could you
put on the meter?'
'I'm afraid it's not working.'
At this point you threaten to get out of the taxi.
If done with good humour, you will immediately be called Dotto (Doctor - a
sign of respect) and then be treated to a display of Neapolitan driving -
something to be experienced, not described. But you may still be cheated
with some spurious supplementary charge.
Naples offers two railway stations. Napoli Centrali is the main terminal.
But Centrali suffers the inconveniences of being surrounded by a square with
often grid-locked traffic and a high proportion of assorted eastern European
alms-seekers and local importuners. It is often easier to go to Napoli
Mergellina which is close to the sea front, less crowded and allows access
to the main hotel area in less than 10 minutes.
Inter-city trains only ever stop at one of these two stations. However,
there is a useful underground link between them - the only part of the
city's long-promised metro.
Public transport is erratic and crowded, although in less than six months a
new mayor has performed wonders. He has managed to reduce the appalling
traffic jams of the past merely by making the traffic police work. A large
number were found to have been clocking in, only to go home with the excuse
that the traffic was so bad that their presence made no difference. The G-7
summit is an additional incentive to spruce up the city and improve its
workings.
The city centre is usually easier and more enjoyable to negotiate on foot.
Going by bus can be an uncertain experience: it is not always easy to buy a
ticket before boarding, as passengers are meant to, but board anyway because
no one will bother to check.
The best of Naples hotels are on the corniche of Via Partenope, overlooking
a small marina and the ancient hulk of the Castel Dell'Ovo, with the Bay and
Capri in the distance. Prices are more or less the same, with the Vesuvio at
the top of the range - over L350,000 (Dollars 220) a night. The Santa Lucia
is well-decorated with Neapolitan antiques and has helpful staff, while the
Excelsior appeals to those attracted by faded grandeur. If you want to pay
less, look for the smaller s in Chiaia.
Via Partenope corniche has the advantage of being fairly self-contained. In
front, there are a good 15 restaurants around the Castel Dell'Ovo marina,
all serving good Neapolitan cuisine.
If you come to Naples on business, it is a shame not to see some of the
sights. The priority must be the Museo Archeologico (one of the world's top
museums, with the finest finds from Pompei). There is a surfeit of churches,
Roman and Greek ruins at Pausilypon, palaces and art collections. The
Capodimonte Museum, the most important art gallery, is currently closed for
restoration.
For those with time to go to Pompei, it can be reached by train from Napoli
Centrale. The journey, scheduled to last 45 minutes, in the manner of Naples
often takes longer.

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
any time," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HUGE ERUPTION LIKELY IN PHILIPPINES 'ANY
TIME'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano
today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology said.;    If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash
produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City, where the air base is
located, about 50 miles north of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not
erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at
least, Lipman said.;    Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the
eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he
said.;    The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark
Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near
the volcano.;    The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their
equipment, today  moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles
from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount
Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire"
on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes -- including
Mount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in
Washington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense
crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption,
600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half
a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until
volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath
the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.;    Other recent
volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and
Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption,
Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish
avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to
100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a
really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with
glowing ash, Lipman said.;    Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off
the avalanche is fatal. That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;   
Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base,
Lipman said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash --
indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their
engines stalled by the grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from
the base. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin
any day, would send ash directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity
-- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock
plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is
imminent, Lipman said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on
the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days
they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    Their predictions
might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already. But it
would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before
scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the
base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be
linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.;    "No reputable
scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.;   
More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted. "Two out of
500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  With a powerful midnight explosion that hurled stones more than three miles, a
Japanese volcano erupted Wednesday for the second time in nine days, and
scientists warned that a new and far more dangerous blast was in prospect.;

<TEXT>     Scientists said the Japanese eruption was unrelated to that of Mount
Pinatubo in the Philippines.;    Police called for precautions to be taken at
several more towns near the volcano. They also banned ships from the sea near
the peninsula where the volcano is located for fear of a deadly tsunami, or
sea wave induced by an earthquake.;    Scientists said their instruments had
detected a swelling of the volcano, indicating a buildup of pressure within
the 4,450-foot peak, and counted 18 tremors near the mountain Wednesday.;   
Also, it has been raining on the steaming mountain, which lies about 40 miles
east of Nagasaki and some 600 miles southwest of Tokyo on the island of
Kyushu. That has increased fears of mudslides as swollen creeks breach their
banks and loosen the accumulations of ash.;    Even though Unzen and Pinatubo
are both long-dormant volcanoes in the Far East that came violently to life
within days of each other, most volcanologists maintain that their
simultaneous eruptions are a coincidence.;    "There isn't any connection,"
said David Lescinsky, a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution and a
member of the Global Vulcanism Network. "These are two major ones, but it is
not unique that they are occurring at the same time.";    Some geologists are
investigating the possibility that the eruptions may be linked to a lurch of
one of the tectonic plates that make up Earth's crust. This idea, however,
appears to be a long shot.;    Though the two volcanoes are on the same plate,
Mount Pinatubo and Mount Unzen are so far away from each other that most
geologists say there is no direct link between the two events.;    At any one
time, several volcanoes are bubbling away or exploding someplace in the world,
often in its more obscure corners. Lescinsky said that in the last month more
than a dozen volcanoes have erupted, or at least become significantly active.  </TEXT>

   Much of Europe dug out Monday from a heavy
snowfall that snarled traffic and left thousands without
electricity. At least 12 people were killed and nine were missing
in the Continent's first storm of the winter season.
   Snow fell in France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and
Austria. In southern Europe, heavy rains flooded Venice and forced
the suspension of ferry services.
   Torrential rains fell on the French Riviera. Police in Nice said
two French people were killed Sunday night along the French-Italian
border when bad weather sent rocks falling onto their car.
   Police in Britain, where snow turned to rain and sleet Monday,
said 10 people were killed.
   Five mountain climbers were missing in northern Spain, where
small towns were cut off by the heavy snow. Seven major highway
mountain passes were closed in the provinces of Burgos, Cantabria,
Leon and Soria.
   A Spanish Air Force helicopter and a merchant marine tug
searched off the northern Spanish coast for four people on a French
yacht missing in the Bay of Biscay.
   Roads were closed in the central Portugal Serra de Estrela
range.
   Southeastern and central France were hit by heavy snowfall. The
main highway between Lyon and Grenoble was inaccessible, with
traffic rerouted to a small, one-lane highway. The Mount Blanc
tunnel through the Alps was closed.
   In Switzerland, snow closed roads and delayed train and bus
traffic. The Zermatt ski resort reported 3 feet of snow in 24
hours.
   In Austria, avalanche danger closed many roads in parts of East
Tyrol and western Carinthia. In northern Tyrol, ice on the Inntal
highway caused a 21-car pileup. Police said several people were
injured.
   German police reported numerous accidents on the southern German
autobahns because of heavy snow. Drivers were advised to use chains
on alpine roads.
   Schools in Turin were closed as northern Italy dug out from its
first pre-Christmas snow since 1964. Snow fell Sunday on Mount
Vesuvius and the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples, where heavy
winds halted ferry traffic.
   Wind-driven seas flooded Venice. By daybreak Monday, 40 percent
of the city was flooded, including low-lying St. Mark's Square.
   Train travel was disrupted as British Rail tried to clear
snow-covered lines. British Rail said it had only two snowplow
locomotives for 10,000 miles of track. It was considered a waste of
money to buy more when the country did not have heavy snow every
winter, the state-run network said.
   Six people were expected to appear before magistrates Monday in
Coventry, England, where looters stole jewelry, clothes and stereos
while police car patrols were halted by snow. Later, officers were
sent out on foot.

<TEXT>     "He's someone who eats it up," said Randy White, Harlow's friend and
colleague at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "He's able to totally
concentrate in those sorts of situations.";    The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo
finally gave Harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving
lives. When Harlow went to Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980,
geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes.
Bureaucratic delays kept Harlow from arriving at Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia
until a day after its 1985 eruption. Harlow and his team predicted the 1989
eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the
remote area.;    Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological
Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast
the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One
crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its
potential power.;    Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs
around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly
pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption
is imminent.;    Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past
six weeks. Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas,
the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more
than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the
narrow valleys west of the volcano.;    Philippine and U.S. Air Force
officials ordered evacuations Monday.;    Since late Tuesday, Harlow's
colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the
bunker at Clark Air Base, but do not believe the team is in danger. The
eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding Clark.
Prevailing winds are also away from the base.;    "I'm not so concerned," said
Pauline Lord, Harlow's wife. "My husband is not unaccustomed to danger.";   
Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an
undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and his professor took the entire
class to observe an eruption in Guatemala.;    "He's somebody who's fascinated
by that kind of energy," said Lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied
Harlow to several volcanoes. "It's wonderful to see that lava sloshing
around.";    Harlow's 5-year-old daughter, Megan, is not worried about her
father.;    "She knows Daddy is in the Philippines and that he's fixing a
volcano," Lord said.  </TEXT>

   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.

severe burns and clothes in shreds were taken to nearby hospitals after the

hundreds of yards from the mountain, site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster
200 years ago, when 15,000 people died. The area was jolted by earthquakes
early today, the Meteorological Agency reported.;    Miles away, thick
volcanic ash spattered windshields and covered buildings.;    "We are about

Shimabara city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.;    Glicken, who
worked for the U.S. Geological Survey until 1989, had moved to Japan to do
research.;    He had been part of the team of scientists studying Mount St.

Survey scientist David Johnston, who took Glicken's place.;    "If I heard a
volcano was going to erupt, I would head the other direction," Fuller said.
"But vulcanologists head right for it. It's not always a healthy thing.";   
After graduating from Stanford University, Glicken began his graduate work at
UCSB in 1980, Fuller said. Glicken eventually completed his Ph.D. on the topic
of Mount St. Helens in 1986, Fuller said.;    "He was a very serious student
who did good work," Fuller said.;    Prior to Monday's eruption, Glicken, who
is originally from Los Angeles, had been working and living in Tokyo as part
of his research for the university, Fuller said.;    Glicken's father, Milton
Glicken of Los Angeles, said Monday he had not heard from his son for several
weeks.;    The missing also included some police and firefighters who had been
keeping watch and photographing Mount Unzen, which is less than 30 miles from
Nagasaki.;    The search for survivors and bodies began today after the

to retreat after an eruption. They recovered four bodies and said 24 others

FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Taming the volcanoes - Improved forecasting
techniques are making it easier to predict eruptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volcanoes, which spit ash, ooze lava and create darkness in the middle of
the day, are impressive displays of nature's restlessness. They are also
life-threatening: more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the
1980s. They can cause millions of dollars in property damage and bring
industrial activity to a grinding halt.
New technology to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping to
minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause. After the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986, the US government
began taking volcanic forecasting seriously. The US Geological Survey, which
tracks volcanic activity around the world, was infused with new funds to
create a detailed database and update its techniques.
The new technology will not only help to save thousands of lives, it may
also save millions of dollars. According to the Aviation Safety Journal,
more than 60 aircraft have been damaged by drifting clouds of volcanic ash
since 1980. The repair of a 747 aircraft damaged during the 1989 eruption
from Redoubt Volcano in Alaska cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m).
The continuous eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea since 1983 has caused more than
Dollars 5m in damage, much of it to properties and crops affected by the
acid-bearing volcanic pollutants. Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped
out thousands of acres of productive timberland.
Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be
more devastating. Redoubt's eruption, for instance, caused a valuable oil
storage terminal to close for several weeks and halted most flights into and
out of the region.
Tourism often takes the hardest hit of all. When US geologists issued
eruption warnings in California's Long Valley in 1982, the resort area
turned into a ghost town almost overnight. And the tourist-based economy of
Guadeloupe neared collapse in 1976 after an international group of
volcanologists forecast the eruption of La Soufriere.
The Long Valley and Guadeloupe incidents are tinged with bitterness since
the predicted disasters never happened. Guadeloupe evacuated 72,000 people
and tourists stayed away. Yet the only crisis that hit the Caribbean island
was in the economic sphere.
Scientists blame these fiascos on insufficient data. 'The identification of
fresh volcanic glass in the erupted ash - which seemed to indicate that the
volcano was about to erupt violently - was a mistake,' wrote Richard Fiske,
a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution, about the incident.
Volcanologists today use more sophisticated techniques. Detailed databases
are maintained on all life-threatening volcanoes around the world.
High-frequency monitors to measure debris flows are now in place.
Earthquakes - often the first warning of volcanic activity - are tracked
with increasing accuracy. And changes in gas composition, electrical
conductivity and other clues are carefully monitored.
As a result, volcanic activity can now be forecast with substantial
accuracy, often pinpointing the eruption to within days or even hours of its
actual occurrence. When Redoubt erupted in Alaska in 1989 and Pinatubo blew
its top in the Philippines in 1991, volcanologists provided important
information, not only about the timing of the events, but also about the
direction of debris flows and ash blooms - vast clouds formed when tiny
pieces of lava or rock are thrown into the air.
'We used information on the ash blooms (during the Redoubt eruption) to know
which areas to stay away from, and which were safe to fly through,' says
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Air.
Companies can also take advantage of eruption forecasts to move valuable
equipment out of the way, and evacuate employees from the area.
'Businesses with sensitive electronics may want to shut down their air
filtration system during an ash bloom,' says Steven Brantley, public
information scientist with the US Geological Survey. Since ash blooms often
drift for many miles, they can wreak havoc on property well beyond the
life-threatening zone of eruption.
Volcanology can also be used for future planning. After much of its timber
was wiped out during the eruption of Mount St Helens, the paper group
Weyerhaeuser consulted experts to decide which areas should be replanted and
which avoided as too high-risk.
Not all businesses welcome the interference of volcanologists, however. In
Long Valley developers have refused to heed warnings in land use planning.
'We've had mixed results, because we can't force people to follow our
advice,' says Daniel Miller, a geologist with the US Geological Survey.
'We've had a very negative and unpleasant response from businesses in Long
Valley. They just don't believe that they might be in a risk zone and insist
on building things anywhere they please.'
Developers in the region complain that the volcanologists' warnings have
resulted in higher insurance rates, limited areas of potential development
and stoked the fears of tourists.
The relationship between active volcanoes and the communities that surround
them is not always confrontational. Kilauea has become a leading Hawaiian
tourist attraction. It is considered the ideal volcano. Because the eruption
is continuous, it is seldom life-threatening and ash blooms are rare.
Instead, the volcano throws up a scenic display of colourful lava, which
attracts hikers by day and creates a natural light show at night.
Scientists have gleaned much useful information from the decade-long
eruption.
'The resorts look to us to provide information on best viewing times, which
they pass on to the tourists,' says David Clague, scientist in charge of the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory at Kilauea. 'It's generally pretty tame as far as
volcano eruptions go, but it's spectacular at night because it's
iridescent.'

<LEADPARA>  For two days after ominous earthquakes and rising magma led to the evacuation
of nearly 90,000 people around Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, the Menlo
Park geologist who predicted the volcano's eruption wondered whether he had
done the right thing.;    "Your emotional swings are tremendous in a thing
like this," David Harlow of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park said
Monday after returning from a month near the volcano. "Are we doing the right
thing? Is our interpretation correct?"  </LEADPARA>

GEOLOGIST AGONIZED OVER PREDICTING VOLCANO
ERUPTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Harlow and a team of 14 other American and Filipino scientists proved
prescient when Pinatubo erupted June 12 in the first of a series of
spectacular explosions that are continuing. At least 296 people have died and
20 are missing, a tiny fraction of the number of people who would have been
killed without accurate forecasts.;    The evacuation in the Philippines was
the most successful effort ever to marry the new science of volcano prediction
with local disaster planning to save lives.;    'Not a lot of heroes'; 
Harlow, 47, one of a handful of volcano seismologists in the world, discounted
his "Indiana Jones" reputation and said the successful forecast and evacuation
was the result of "a lot of people taking a lot of responsibility and making
hard decisions. It was not an effort that had a lot of heroes, frankly.";   
Working with less than four hours of sleep per night in a windowless building
at Clark Air Force Base about 15 miles from the volcano, the geologists told
local and military commanders on June 8, that they could not guarantee the
volcano would not explode in the next 24 hours.;    That forecast triggered
the evacuation, June 10. The eruption could still have been weeks, or even
months, away, Harlow said.;    The only time he felt in danger, Harlow said,
was when the first major eruption came two days later.;    At 6 a.m. the ash
cloud and a small typhoon had completely obscured the mountain, leaving the
team dependent on its instruments: a string of seven seismographs to detect
earthquakes and two tiltmeters to measure the creep of the earth. By 10 a.m.,
the team was nervous enough to leave the base themselves.;    To leave or
stay?;  "Once we got outside the walls, we began to have second thoughts and
decided, 'Nah, we can handle this,' " Harlow said. "So we went back onto the
base.";    By 2 p.m., all the instrument stations between the geologists and
the volcano were out of service, and the team piled into a station wagon to
move about nine miles east.;    "By that time, it was as dark as the middle of
the night," Harlow said. "Ash was falling out of the sky. . . . All that time,
one of us was sitting out the window of the car, squirting soda on the
windshield to keep the mud and ash off. We were glad we had it.";    On the
open-ended Volcanic Explosivity Index, Pinatubo has been graded a high 5 or
low 6, making it one of the two or three largest eruptions this century. For
comparison, Mount St. Helens was a low 5. For Harlow, who has studied
volcanoes for more than 20 years, the experience was among the most rewarding
of his life.;    "One could say the volcano behaved very nicely," he said. "It
performed on schedule."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Robert Tilling of the USGS will
present a slide show, "Volcano: Friend or Foe," at 7 p.m. Thursday in the USGS
Building 3 conference room, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park.  </TEXT>
