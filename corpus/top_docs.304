   Classes were supposed to start here
Wednesday, but after a few howling minutes of chaos there was no
class, no school, and for many residents, no home.
   The twisters that tore into this northern Illinois community and
several neighboring towns Tuesday killed at least 24 people and
injured more than 300. As they flipped cars and tore roofs off
houses, the tornadoes also threatened to bury hundreds of lives.
   ``Life in Plainfield, Crest Hill, Joliet and surrounding towns
will never be the same,'' said an editorial in Wednesday's Joliet
Herald-News. ``It has only been a few hours since the tragedy
struck. It will take days, weeks and years to recover.''
   Scores of residents were left homeless. Some residents who had
been planning a new beginning were suddenly faced with nothing.
   Jerry O'Shea, a new teacher, was getting ready for the start of
classes and left Plainfield High School minutes before the twisters
hit. He returned Wednesday to a school in ruin.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welcome to Plainfield.''
   In the Warwick subdivision of Joliet, about 35 miles southwest
of Chicago, new homes finished in the last six months were reduced
to their foundations in minutes. Joliet officials had to explain to
a touring Gov. James R. Thompson that it wasn't a construction zone.
   ``All these homes were occupied,'' said Joliet Alderman Warren
Dorris. ``We lost 31 (homes) and we had three fatalities here. It's
just a shock.''
   There were even more homeless at a seven-building apartment
complex in Crest Hill, near Plainfield. Parts of the complex were
destroyed, and authorities were only allowing people into
relatively undamaged buildings to retrieve personal belongings.
   Norm Treonis, chairman of the company that owns the apartment
complex, said he was working to put displaced residents into some
of the company's other vacant apartments, rent-free, for up to two
months.
   Workers also were issuing checks on the spot to reimburse
residents for security deposits and rent. By late morning Treonis
had issued checks to more than 100 people for amounts ranging from
$200 to $600.
   Most storefronts along Plainfield's main thoroughfare, Lockport
Street, were shuttered Wednesday. But two insurance agencies were
doing a brisk business.
   ``We've had three dozen calls since eight o'clock this
morning,'' said Mike Hull of Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.
   In Plainfield Township people also hurried to clean yards and
what was left of their homes.
   ``We're just waiting for the insurance guy to come out,'' said
Jim Schmidt, owner of a frame house that suffered extensive damage
in the storm. ``Obviously it's going to be a while.''
   The American Red Cross had three shelters for the homeless.
While providing for immediate needs such as food and clothing, the
organization was also concerned about the long-term mental impact
of the disaster.
   The Red Cross will provide ``someone to talk to and some stress
counseling,'' said spokeswoman Michele McCrillis.
   ``A lot of people _ it hasn't hit them yet,'' she said. ``The
full shock isn't going to hit them probably for a little while.''
   The flat area southwest of Chicago is sometimes referred to as
``Tornado Alley.'' On June 23, 1976, three people were killed when
a twister passed through nearby Lemont. A 1969 tornado killed 33
people in Oak Lawn, a southwest Chicago suburb.

   National Guardsmen and fire officials
searched a muddy cornfield today for more victims of tornadoes that
flattened scores of homes and killed at least 24 people.
   The dead included at least nine people found near a demolished
apartment complex where six residents were missing, Lockport Fire
Chief Dave Martis said today.
   At least 306 people were treated at hospitals after the cluster
of tornadoes touched down in four spots Tuesday afternoon, cutting
an eight-mile trail of destruction leading to the northern Illinois
city of Joliet. At least 11 people were listed in critical
condition today.
   In nearby Plainfield, residents began returning to the rubble of
their homes.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' said 41-year-old Bruce Marshall as he tried to fashion a
makeshift cover for his roofless home.
   Gov. James R. Thompson declared Will County a state disaster
area, and requested that President Bush declare the area a federal
disaster to provide additional relief.
   ``Nothing in my personal experience ... compares with this,''
Thompson said during a tour of Plainfield today.
   Illinois Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced that the state will
provide at least $25 million for low-interest loans to tornado
victims.
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, thunderstorms Tuesday halted power to
70,000 customers in central and western Ohio. A tornado touched
down south of Tecumseh in southern Michigan and storms that ripped
through northern Indiana left at least one person dead. Pat Jones,
27, was killed when the house he was building in South Bend
collapsed.
   At least two tornadoes were spotted in northwestern
Pennsylvania, but no injuries were reported.
   Preliminary tallies made in the dark from the tornadoes in
Illinois suggested more than 100 houses were destroyed, in addition
to the apartment complex and a high school. The storms blacked out
17,000 homes and businesses, tossed trucks like toys and flattened
crops.
   ``Cars were flying all over the place,'' said Tony Aloisio, who
was driving by and stopped to help. ``It happened so fast that all
I could do was sit there and watch. Then 15 minutes later the skies
got blue like it had never even happened.''
   About 30 Guardsmen took up positions in the three affected
communities overnight and 150 were to arrive later in the day to
search for victims and provide security, said Col. Phil Becker, a
National Guard brigade commander.
   At least four people were arrested for looting, and five others
were taken into custody for interfering with rescuers, authorities
said.
   ``I saw everything out there,'' said Will County Executive
Charles Adelman. ``Refrigerators, TV sets, washing machines, cars
stacked three high.''
   The twisters _ experts were unsure exactly how many _ hit
Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill, and
Plainfield to the northwest.
   Crest Hill Mayor Don Randich was among the first firefighters to
arrive at the apartment complex. ``There were people wandering
around, dazed,'' he said. ``Automobile horns were blowing, but
there was no one in the cars. It was total confusion.''
   Martis said the bodies of nine people were found near the
apartment complex. Seven bodies, including that of a 4-month-old
baby, were lying in a cornfield, some of them 400 feet from their
apartments, and two were found in a car nearby, Martis said.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels or just their hands.
   The death toll was unclear. There were 24 confirmed fatalities
as of 8:30 a.m. today, and there may be 30 dead, said John Plunk,
acting director of the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster
Agency.
   The Red Cross said about 600 people left homeless were given
shelter.
   Michael Hejka, 28, was at a friend's house in Plainfield, a
community of 4,500, when the tornado hit. ``I saw trees bending,
and I said to my buddy, `It's a tornado!''' Hejka said. ``I said,
`Jump into the bathtub.' He jumped in, and I jumped in right on top
of him. The whole house lifted up, and then came down.''
   Plainfield High School was demolished and some of the 175
students and teachers inside were hurt. Catastrophe was averted
because coaches rushed dozens of athletes from a gym before the
roof collapsed.
   ``We had some very short warnings,'' said teacher Steve
Schernerhorn. ``We immediately took cover.''
   Teacher Mike Salisburg said cars in the parking lot were thrown
hundreds of yards.
   Will County is part of a frequently hit ``tornado alley.'' A
tornado hit Plainfield Township in 1984, injuring six people and
demolishing 14 homes. In 1976, a twister hit Lemont, 10 miles from
Plainfield, killing three people and injuring as many as 40. That
tornado damaged 375 houses and businesses.

   Tornadoes ripped through several
northern Illinois towns Tuesday, blowing residents out of apartment
buildings and leveling at least 100 homes and a school. As many as
26 were reported dead and the death toll was expected to rise.
   Local hospitals said at least 290 people were being treated for
storm-caused injuries.
   The tornadoes touched down at least four times just after 3:30
p.m. CDT along a seven-mile southwesterly path from the community
of Plainfield to Joliet, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago,
Illinois State Police said.
   In Crest Hill, on the outskirts of Joliet, eight people were
killed when the twister flattened an apartment complex, said
Lockport Fire Chief Dave Martis. Four bodies, including that of a
4-month old baby, were lying in a cornfield next to the complex,
and four others were pulled from the collapsed buildings and a car.
   ``When the storm went through, some of the buildings
disintegrated,'' Martis said. ``High winds blew some of the people
into the corn field.''
   Guy Allton, 16, watched the storm from his house near Plainfield
High School.
   ``We went outside, and there was picnic tables flying past our
faces and stuff,'' Allton said.
   Afterward he helped pull people from nearby houses, including
two badly hurt babies.
   ``Everything was messed up,'' Allton said. ``Lots and lots of
people hurt.''
   Officials' counts of the dead varied from 20 to 26, and some
said they expected to find more bodies when searching resumed
Wednesday.
   Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency spokesman Lynn
Bobo said late Tuesday that 26 people were killed.
   The Will County coroner said 20 bodies had been brought to a
central morgue as of 11:45 p.m. CDT. Others might be in transit,
but some may have been counted twice, said coroner Duane Krueger.
   Five people died in Plainfield, said John Watson, ambulance
services chief for the Plainfield Fire Department.
   Four people were killed in Joliet, including three in a
subdivision under construction, said Police Chief Dennis Nowicki.
   ``I'm not confident the death toll won't rise,'' said Will
County Executive Charles Adelman, noting that it wasn't known how
many people were inside the heavily damaged Plainfield High School.
   There were several arrests for looting, Adelman said.
   It wasn't immediately clear where the others of the 23 were
found.
   The National Guard was called out Tuesday evening to help state
police prevent looting and control crowds in the area, said Ms.
Bobo, the emergency services spokeswoman.
   Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan reported 17,000
customers without power in the area hit by the storms.
   Judi Mack, a spokeswoman for St. Joseph Hospital in Joliet, said
the hospital had received 157 storm victims. Only 25 were admitted
with injuries ranging from minor to severe, she said.
   Thirty-five people were taken to Silver Cross Hospital, where
they were in serious to fair condition, said spokeswoman Susan
Larson. Several other hospitals also reported treating storm
victims.
   Plainfield High School was destroyed and some teachers and
students were injured, said Steve Schernerhorn, who with other
teachers and student athletes crouched in the halls as the roof was
blown off.
   ``We had some very short warnings. We immediately took cover,''
he said in a telephone interview. He said about 25 houses near the
school were destroyed.
   Dozens of athletes were in the gym shortly before the tornado
hit, but coaches moved them to another part of the school just
before the gym roof collapsed onto the floor.
   Principal Jim Waldorf said as many as 175 people were in the
school at the time of the storm, and a number of them suffered
minor injuries.
   Teacher Mike Salisburg said some cars in the school parking lot
were thrown as far as several hundred yards.
   Major damage was also reported at St. Mary's Elementary School
nearby.
   Eric Curtis, 24, who lives a half-mile northwest of the high
school, said he was at home when the twister hit.
   ``I felt real bad pressure in my head,'' Curtis said. ``I saw my
dad running toward the house.''
   The Curtis house suffered only minor damage, but others in the
neighborhood were wrecked.
   Michael Hejka, 28, arrived at his friend's house five minutes
before the tornado hit.
   ``I saw trees bending, and I said to my buddy, `It's a
tornado!''' Hejka said. ``I said, `Jump into the bathtub.' He
jumped in, and I jumped in right on top of him. The whole house
lifted up, and then came down.''
   Phone lines into the area were jammed; many were reported down.
   At least nine emergency shelters were set up by local disaster
agencies and the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross was supplying clothing, toiletries and food.
   Will County is part of a frequently hit ``tornado alley,'' the
National Weather Service said. A tornado hit Plainfield Township in
April 1984, injuring six people and demolishing 14 homes. In June
1976, a twister hit Lemont, 10 miles northeast of Plainfield,
killing three people and injuring as many as 40. That tornado
damaged 375 houses and businesses.
   Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan reported 17,000
customers without power in the area hit by the storms.
   State Police spokesman Robert Fletcher said at least 50 houses
were leveled, about 30 of them north of Plainfield and 20 or 30
near the Louis Joliet Mall just outside Joliet.
   Other State Police officials reported 15 to 20 houses damaged in
unincorporated areas of Will County.
   Watson, of the Plainfield Fire Department, said emergency
workers found 40 homes flattened southeast of the city.
   At least six people were injured in pileups on Interstate 55
caused by violent winds, said State Police Lt. Clifford Mann. The
interstate at U.S. 30 was down to one lane of traffic because of a
semi tractor-trailer rig blown over, he said.
   Crops were flattened west and north of Joliet.
   Many roads were blocked by trees, and toppled electric towers
and downed lines sparked fires in Joliet, Mezera said.
   In Plainfield, a dumpster was lodged in the upper branches of a
tall tree, an empty dump truck was on its side and an empty van was
found after it fell off a bridge into the DuPage River. Seachers
were combing the banks of the debris-clogged stream.

   Rescuers on Wednesday searched a
tornado-devastated swath of northern Illinois for the missing and
the dead, while folks began salvaging belongings from homes the
twisters shredded ``like an eggbeater.''
   At least 24 people died and more than 300 were injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled across a region known as
``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   Scores of people were left homeless. Others spent the day
cleaning their yards, hammering on temporary roofs, sifting through
rubble, piling up belongings in pickup trucks lining the streets in
neighboring Plainfield. Offers of aid have poured in, including one
from the Soviet embassy in Washington.
   Theresa Rabaduex, a 23-year-old school bus driver who lived in a
complex ripped apart by the storm in Crest Hill, said tenants in
her building were being moved to free lodging ``but that doesn't do
you any good if you don't have any of your things. I don't even
have a bed.''
   She walked through the debris, trying to find her three black
cats. ``That's all that really matters to me,'' she said.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' Bruce Marshall said as he tried to fashion a makeshift
cover for his roofless home in neighboring Plainfield.
   The storms struck virtually without warning Tuesday afternoon
along an eight-mile path. Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest
Hill and Plainfield. Portions of Joliet also were damaged,
including a new subdivision of houses torn down to their
foundations just a few months after they were built.
   Gov. James R. Thompson said he's seen a lot of disasters during
14 years in office, but ``nothing in my personal experience ...
compares with this.''
   ``Anything that is still standing is pure luck,'' he said after
touring the stricken area Wednesday.
   ``All I can say is thank God the death toll is not in the
hundreds. We are very, very lucky.''
   President Bush declared the region a disaster area. The Soviet
officials called the governor's office seeking information on how
to help, Thompson said.
   Illinois will provide at least $25 million in state deposits for
low-interest loans to tornado victims, said state Treasurer Jerry
Cosentino.
   There were 24 fatalities confirmed Wednesday, and toll could
reach 30 dead, said John Plunk, acting director of the Illinois
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency. Officials said another
Plainfield man died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator
he used when power was lost in his home.
   More than 300 people were treated at hospitals, and authorities
said more than 70 remained hospitalized Wednesday. At least 11 of
them were listed in critical condition.
   Wednesday's weather, sunny and cool, gave the area some relief,
and the forecast called for fair skies the rest of the week.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy corn
field, but found none. Six people were believed missing from a
seven-building apartment complex next to the field.
   The infrared scan from a helicopter was intended to detect
differences in temperature that might lead them to victims.
   At least nine of the storm's deaths occurred near the
apartments, where some victims were blown 400 feet out of the
building, said Chief Dave Martis of the Lockport Fire District,
which includes Crest Hill.
   Downed power lines were scattered across several streets and
nearly 7,000 customers remained without power Wednesday in Joliet,
Plainfield and the Aurora area.
   The smell of fresh wood permeated the air as residents used
chain saws to remove trees tossed like matchsticks across their
yards.
   ``I've got lots of family members helping, and some four or five
guys from surrounding towns,'' said Don Kinley, 53, of Plainfield,
who lost most of the second floor of his home.
   ``I don't know them _ they just want to help,'' said Kinley,
tears running down his cheeks.
   Mike Thomas, owner of a Naperville wiring company, said he
decided to take the day off to help Kinley and other people because
``They'd probably do it for me.''
   Night clothes hung from trees that had leaves ripped from
branches. Cars remained in front yards, where they were dumped by
the storms. A garbage bin was impaled high in a tree.
   Mike Dehler, a 26-year-old restaurant manager sifted through the
debris outside what used to be his third-floor apartment.
   ``There's my water bed,'' Dehler said, pointing to a deflated
silver mattress. ``Hopefully I'm going to find some clothes in
these dressers. All I have is what I have on.''

   Survivors of northern Illinois' deadly
storm say it struck virtually without warning, and a weather
forecaster said that even when there are warnings, ``in most cases
it's too late.''
   ``Your chances of being warned before a tornado hits aren't all
that great,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Dickey
said Wednesday, pointing out that the notice comes only after a
tornado has been sighted.
   Multiple tornadoes Tuesday left at least 24 dead and more than
300 injured.
   ``We didn't get any warning,'' said Plainfield Police Chief Don
Bennett.
   The tornadoes that swooped into Plainfield appeared out of a
single thunderstorm that rumbled across northern Illinois for about
two hours, spitting hail 2 to 3 inches in diameter as it went.
   The weather service issued a severe thunderstorm watch at about
1:30 p.m. as the storm approached Rockford, then followed it up
with more notices as the storm moved southeast, warning of
dangerous lightning, heavy rain and strong winds.
   ``Remember ... severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do
produce a tornado with little or no advance warning ... so be on
the lookout,'' read one warning.
   But the storm seemed to be limited to hail and high winds.
   ``The system seemed to have gotten less threatening,'' said John
Plunk, director of the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster
Agency. ``Then this hit out of the blue. When it forms that fast
and moves that quickly, there's nothing you can do.''
   At 3:45 p.m., the first call came in to the weather service
reporting a tornado touchdown at Plainfield, said forecaster
Richard Kenneman. The weather service moved a bulletin at 3:51
p.m., but by that time the twisters had already smashed through the
town and into Joliet, about 15 miles away.
   Janet Fazio said the few teachers and administrators at
Plainfield High School at the end of the day didn't know the storm
was coming until a school worker eyed it while closing a window
that had blown open.
   ``The emergency radio didn't even go off in the main office,''
said Mrs. Fazio, a secretary.
   The tornadoes virtually destroyed the school, which had been
scheduled to open for classes Wednesday. Most teachers and
administrators had left for the day when the storm struck, and some
took shelter in the school vault.
   In a Joliet subdivision 35 miles southwest of Chicago, Rich
Alberti got the warning from his wife, Michelle, moments before
their house was destroyed.
   ``I was sleeping and she was getting ready to take a shower,''
Alberti said. ``She told me to look out. As soon as I saw it, I
knew it was a tornado. There weren't seconds to spare.''
   Kenneman said tornadoes themselves are too small to be detected
by available radar, but thunderstorms sometimes contain radar
patterns that indicate a tornado may be developing. The
thunderstorm Tuesday did not contain the telltale indications that
twisters were lurking inside, Kenneman said.
   More sophisticated radar is being developed. But, he said, even
fair warning can't always protect against nature's most devastating
force.
   ``Even assuming the whole warning process plays through
successfully and people hear the warning, there are some tornadoes
that are violent enough that they are flat out not survivable,''
Kenneman said.
   ``We have to live with the fact that, unless we want to live in
concrete reinforced bunkers and drive 80,000-pound steel cars, that
we are going to be vulnerable when weather is severe enough,'' he
said.

The most powerful series of tornadoes in this area in more than two decades 
tore a path of death and destruction across suburbs southwest of Chicago 
Tuesday afternoon, killing at least 23 people and flattening 100 homes, an 
apartment complex, a church and a high school in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Four separate tornadoes spawned by a hot, muggy storm cell touched down amid 
the subdivisions and cornfields in the vicinity of Joliet, about 30 miles 
outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals reported more than 280 people injured, many of them critically. 
Officials said they expected the number of deaths and injuries to rise through 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. James R. Thompson activated two Illinois National Guard units 
to help police maintain order and restore public services. As of late Tuesday, 
two people had been arrested for looting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the twisters slammed into the Cedar Woods Apartment Complex in Crest 
Hill about 3:40 p.m., knocking some three-story brick buildings to the ground 
and stripping the top two floors off others. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said they pulled several bodies from the rubble and were 
frantically searching for more victims as daylight faded. Some victims were 
thrown from buildings by the force of the storm and landed more than 200 yards 
away in a cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It was total devastation; it looked like a bomb had hit," said one fireman who 
helped pull bodies from the field. He said most of the dead were clad only in 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary Immaculate Church in Plainfield was almost completely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The storm mangled power and telephone lines and cut vital services to tens of 
thousands of residents in the area. It caused numerous traffic accidents on 
Interstate 55 as high winds tossed dozens of cars and trucks off the road. At 
least six people were injured in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Downed power lines sparked several small fires, officials said. Residents in 
some affected areas were warned not to drink tap water. 
</P>
<P>
At least two deaths were reported at Plainfield High School, which was hit 
point-blank by one of the tornadoes only a day before the beginning of the 
regular school year. At the time, several teachers and administrators were 
inside the building preparing for the start of classes, and members of the 
football and women's volleyball teams were practicing. 
</P>
<P>
The students raced inside the structure just moments before the twister smacked 
into it, blowing the roof off and toppling many walls. Miraculously, none of 
the youngsters were among those reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some very short warnings," said Steve Schernerhorn, a school 
administrator. "We immediately took cover . . . . There is no school left . . . 
. All the houses in front of the school are pretty much gone." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, 16-year-old Guy Allton watched from his home as the school crumbled. 
"We went outside and there were picnic tables blowing past our faces and 
stuff," Allton told Associated Press. "Everything was messed up. Everything on 
James Street is totaled. Lots and lots of people hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Candi Vance, another Plainfield student, was not at school when the storm hit 
but barely escaped with her life anyway. The 16-year-old Vance was visiting her 
grandmother in the Lilly Cash subdivision in Plainfield when a tornado swooped 
out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The two women had just begun to scramble down the stairs to the basement when 
the roof and much of the rest of the house collapsed. "It came down; the steps 
fell on top of us," Vance recalled. "All I could see was the sky. There's 
nothing left . . . . No one can believe we made it out alive." 
</P>
<P>
Vance was treated at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet for a twisted ankle 
and bruised bones in her knee. Her grandmother suffered cuts on one leg from 
the knee to the ankle and was bleeding badly when she was brought into the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, huge traffic jams filled the roads throughout the southwestern 
suburbs as commuters returning from work tried to navigate through darkened 
streets obstructed by floodwaters and debris. Police roadblocks and the lack of 
stoplights added to the congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people with injuries ranging from minor cuts to serious head 
wounds were shuttled by ambulances to hospitals in Joliet. One of the 
facilities was so overwhelmed that it set up an emergency treatment center in 
its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities set up several shelters in area churches and schools for those who 
had lost their homes or were having trouble coping with the lack of 
electricity. Clair Swan, superintendent of schools in suburban Shorewood, said 
all three of his district's schools would be used as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"At least 1,000 people, maybe more, will sleep here tonight," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents also opened their doors to those in need. A local radio 
station in Joliet was broadcasting the names and addresses of residents who had 
called in with offers to put up the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Area businesses also offered relief, including a bed-and-mattress shop that 
said it would let displaced people come in and sleep on the floor samples.

   Robert Whitesel had lived on Nuclear
Drive for 29 years, and the street name seemed grimly appropriate
as he surveyed the tornado-whipped wreckage of his house and those
of his neighbors.
   ``You have to laugh _ you can't cry,'' Whitesel said Wednesday.
``I'll probably rebuild it. In the meantime, I'll live with my
daughter.''
   At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled virtually without warning
across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles
southwest of Chicago. Damage was estimated at more than $100
million.
   Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest Hill and Plainfield,
where hundreds were left homeless.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy
cornfield but found none.
   Six people were believed missing from a seven-building apartment
complex next to the field. At least nine deaths occurred near the
apartments.
   Plainfield residents packed a high school gym Wednesday night to
hear how various government agencies could help. President Bush
declared the region a disaster area and Illinois offered at least
$25 million for low-interest loans.
   The crowd observed a moment of silence for those who died. Then
they got down to the needs of the living _ getting shelter,
portable toilets for neighborhoods without running water, trash
bins for the untold tons of debris.
   More than 70 people remained hospitalized today, at least 11 in
critical condition, authorities said. In addition, a Plainfield man
died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator he used when
power was lost in his home.
   And four people were injured today, one critically, when a
mobile kitchen sent in for relief workers exploded and caught fire.
   The explosion occurred when a propane tank overflowed while
being filled from a supply truck and the fuel was ignited by a
flame from a stove in the kitchen set up in a truck trailer, Fire
Chief George Plese said.
   A fire official had to clamp a hose leading from the supply
truck to the kitchen tanks, cut it, then pull the truck away to
stop the fire. ``We had a very dangerous situation,'' Plese said.
   Utility crews worked through the night to restore telephone and
electric service. About 5,000 customers remained without
electricity, officials said.
   The Red Cross, Salvation Army and other charitable groups were
out in force, but self-sufficiency also was evident.
   ``It's the kind of community where neighbors or family say `Stay
with us,' '' said the Rev. Donald Niswonger as he dished out beef
stew, pizza and lasagna at the Plymouth Congregational Church in
Plainfield.
   In Joliet, Roman Catholic Archbishop Joseph Imesch said an
evening Mass for the victims and their families. The tornado ``will
be a reminder of how fragile life is,'' he said.
   At Plainfield High School, newly hired English teacher Jerry
O'Shea stood amid water and broken glass in front of a shattered
trophy case in the main hallway.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welome to Plainfield. I don't know what I'll do now.''
   Most stores along Plainfield's main street were shuttered, but
two insurance agencies were doing brisk business. ``We've had
three-dozen calls since 8 o'clock this morning,'' said Mike Hull of
Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.

   Biology teacher Stephen Hunt died when a
tornado grabbed a truck in front of Plainfield High School and
dropped it onto the second floor of the science department, where
he worked.
   Only rooms away, business teacher Linda Kinnikin survived
unscathed.
   Behind the school, which was demolished, the twister leveled
Shirley and Gene Fassiotto's home, plucking their car from a now
nonexistent garage and depositing it upside down where the living
room once stood.
   Across the street, Lois Moffitt's brick ranch-style house still
stands.
   The capriciousness of the tornadoes that spun across northern
Illinois on Tuesday is painfully obvious to the survivors of the
storms.
   ``They say tornadoes touch down and jump all over the place,''
Mrs. Kinnikin said, shaking her head Wednesday as she examined the
rubble that killed her colleague.
   ``In a matter of a minute's time, it all changed,'' she said.
   The death toll climbed to 27 Thursday when a 3-year-old girl and
16-year-old boy died of injuries they suffered in the storms. More
than 300 people were injured.
   Hunt had been talking with Mrs. Kinnikin only a few minutes
before the tornado hit.
   ``He was a dedicated teacher,'' Mrs. Kinnikin said softly, her
eyes brimming with tears.
   Asked how she survived, she shook her head.
   ``I heard so much debris hitting the windows of the building,''
she recalled. ``There was no visibility because the rain was coming
down so hard.
   ``And when the window blew, I took off running for the men's
bathroom. My department chair and I huddled together in the men's
bathroom. I said `Oh, my God' three times, and it was over.''
   When she climbed out of the rubble, she saw the walls in ruins,
the roof blown off, and smashed cars in the parking lot thrown into
a heap.
   At least two dozen people died in the tornadoes that hit Joliet,
Crest Hill and Plainfield, about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   The twisters left more than 1,000 homes uninhabitable and caused
over $100 million in damage. The region has been declared a state
and federal disaster area.
   And the random misfortunes didn't necessarily stop when the
storms left. On Thursday, a truck serving as a mobile kitchen for
relief workers exploded and caught fire in Joliet, injuring four
people, one critically.
   Authorities said a propane tank overflowed while being loaded
and the fuel was ignited by a flame from a stove.
   Three people died on the Plainfield school grounds during the
storm, including Hunt.
   Bruch Reed, 15, said Hunt had like been like a second father to
him.
   ``I've done so much thinking about the people who died,'' said
Reed, who was at a park a few blocks away when the storm hit and
who was unhurt.
   ``I suppose we should'' feel guilty, ``not just because I
survived, but because my house was untouched,'' Reed said.
   ``You always think it doesn't happen, and won't happen to you,''
he said. ``It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, it can
happen.''
   Shirley Fassiotto knows. Her home was reduced to boards, bricks
and plaster strewn about the lot.
   ``We had just gotten to the basement when the walls came down,''
she said.
   Glancing across the street at Mrs. Moffitt's home, she added:
``You wonder. ... She just missed the path (of the twister), who
knows how.''
   ``It doesn't matter what kind of house you have or where you're
situated, the path is so erratic,'' said Mrs. Moffitt, who was
visiting a daughter in Joliet when the storm hit. Windows in her
home were shattered, and the roof was slightly damaged.
   Across the street and down a few houses, Don Erikson, 60, was
less lucky. He was looking out his living room picture window when
the storm hit.
   The tornado drove chunks of glass into his body and threw him
onto the couch. It also tossed his furniture around like toys and
blew off the roof _ but left several paper cups sitting on a
counter.
   Erikson was in fair condition Thursday at a Joliet hospital.
``He lost a lot of blood,'' said his son, Jeff Erikson, 30.

   Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the
beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April
through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the
nation's heartland.
   From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118
tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist's
office in College Station.
   More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,
records show. In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes
occur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the most
unstable, that average increases to about 36.
   A few twisters were already recorded in early March in Texas but
they did little or no damage. A tornado that touched down Tuesday
in central Louisiana, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes.
   ``People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. If
they wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late,'' said
Buddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
   Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas town
of Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162. In mid-November,
11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashed
towns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast.
   ``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. No matter how
much preparation you do there is some property damage and some loss
of life. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself
and property,'' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for the
governor's division of emergency management.
   One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and
tornado warnings issued by the weather service.
   A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of
a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential
funnel clouds.
   A tornado warning means one has already developed and has been
spotted. Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if you
are in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in the
nearest ditch or depression.
   At home, the best place to stay is a basement or underground
storm shelter. If no such shelter is available, go inside a closet
in the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavy
table.
   McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flying
debris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads and
present a low profile.''
   James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster
Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try
to outrun tornadoes in their cars.
   During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonald
said, ``people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at
90 mph.'' Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.
   Another misconception is about opening windows. It was once
believed that windows needed to be open to equalize air pressure
between the storm and the inside of a house to prevent the house
from exploding.
   McIntyre said there are enough natural openings in a house to
equalize air pressure, and ``if that tornado wants to open your
windows, it'll do that for you.''

<HEAD>Radar System That Might Have Warned of Twisters Wasn't Working</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tornado-warning radar system had been disabled
by lightning hours before killer twisters struck several towns in
northern Illinois, a National Weather Service forecaster said today.
   But the forecaster said he didn't believe the system could have
forecast the tornadoes that killed 27 people and injured more than
300 Tuesday across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35
miles southwest of Chicago.
   The weather service's Chicago office issued a severe
thunderstorm warning for the area, but did not alert residents to
the tornadoes until six minutes after they had touched down in the
communities of Plainfield and Crest Hill.
   The office is equipped with an early version of Doppler radar,
which might have provided five to 10 minutes advance warning of the
twisters, said forecaster Carl Williams.
   ``But there's just no way that you can say that it could have
done that,'' Williams said in a telephone interview. ``It's a
primitive system and I don't think it's being out had any effect at
all.''
   Williams said the Doppler radar has not been in wide use in most
weather service offices, but an ``add-on'' Doppler was installed in
1974 on radar equipment dating back to 1957.
   But the Doppler radar in Chicago was knocked out by lightning
hours before Tuesday's storms.
   The Doppler system can detect both those winds that are
approaching and moving away. When winds are detected moving in both
directions at the same time and at high speeds, meteorologists can
quickly determine that they are dealing with a tornado.
   A newer system called NEXRAD is being tested at the weather
service's National Severe Storms Laboratory, officials said. But
that system may not be installed until 1995, Williams said.
   The New York Times reported today that the weather service has
dispatched a team of researchers from the National Severe Storms
Laboratory at Norman, Okla., to assess the effectiveness of its
forecasters and timeliness of the alerts they issued Tuesday.
   ``We will do a complete assessment of the event,'' Robert
Maddox, director of the laboratory, told the newspaper. ``We will
look at the weather observations and the data available to forecast
offices, and if the team can agree on them we will offer
recommendations for improvements.''
   Calls to the Oklahoma lab went unanswered early today.

and Kelsey, were there. Storrer did not even notice that her nylons were

<TEXT>     The houses around her were gone, shattered by the force of the wind. So
great was the devastation that she could not tell where her own home had once
been. She looked around for the familiar landmarks, and they were all gone.;  
 Then she saw the girls, sitting on a curb across the street from what had
been their house. A great wave of relief swept over Storrer as she cried out
and embraced her daughters. She would find out later that Misty, her
14-year-old, had herded her 10-year-old sister, the two dogs and cat into the
basement just as the twister hit.;    This small bedroom community, just to
the east of Wichita, bore the harshest brunt of the dozens of tornadoes that
whipped through six states Friday, killing at least 29 people -- 19 of them in
Andover.;    In all, more than 70 tornadoes touched down from Texas to
Nebraska, the National Weather Service said. Twenty-six people died in Kansas
and three in Oklahoma. The twisters also left more than 200 injured and at
least 1,500 homeless.;    But the most serious damage was in and around the
Wichita area.;    "What I saw made me heartsick," said Kansas Gov. Joan Finney
after an aerial tour. "The suffering must be intense." She issued a state
disaster declaration, the first step in seeking federal assistance for the
devastated area.;    The worst tornado;  The most destructive of the tornadoes
left a path about a mile wide and 43 miles long. It first touched down
southwest of Wichita and then began, as all twisters do, to move to the
northeast. At least two trailer parks south of Wichita were destroyed and then
the tornado churned toward McConnell Air Force Base. The base hospital was
heavily damaged, the legal office was blown apart and a number of other
buildings were hit, including a wing of one of the base schools.;    The
tornado then took dead aim at Andover, a town of about 5,000. Alberta Wheeler,
who has lived in Andover with her husband, Kenneth, since 1946, was in the
kitchen of her brick home when the phone rang. It was her son, Richard,
calling from a Wichita bowling alley.;    "He said, 'Mom, hit the basement.
There's buildings falling down all over the place,' " she recounted as she sat
next to her now-roofless house. "I said that I was baking a pie and didn't
have time. And he said, 'Forget the damn pie and get to the basement!' ";   
Barely time to hide;  The basement steps were five feet from the telephone,
but the tornado was on the house by the time the Wheelers reached the bottom
steps. And, in no time, their residence of 45 years was all but gone.;    "It
just took a few minutes to tear everything up," she said. Or, as her daughter,
Holly, put it: "It looked like some hellacious giant came through and walked
on everything.";    Several hundred yards down the road, workers dug through
the Golden Spur Mobile Home Park, where all of the dead of Andover were found.
The trailer park was flattened, as if all of the 290 mobile homes had been put
through a shredding machine. The search for bodies continued through the
morning and afternoon, while some residents complained that officials were not
allowing them back into the area quickly enough to sift through the ruins and
salvage what they could.;    Down the block, Lonnie Bartlett picked up a
pizza, walked home and looked out the back window. He raced to the basement,
along with his wife and son.;    "It wasn't even that noisy," said Bartlett.
"It was kind of a swoosh.";    Like the others, his house is gone.;    A few
doors down, the Inglands crouched under the basement stairs and then looked up
to see daylight because their house had been flattened. Then, cautiously, they
made their way out.;    'Like gophers';  "It was like gophers popping their
heads up," Andy Ingland said, describing the post-tornado scene as his
neighbors in the subdivision reappeared.;    Throughout the day, like others
in this devastated area, residents looked for their belongings. A car in
Ingland's front yard was crunched like a soda can that had been stepped on,
and he pointed out a heavily damaged Honda yards away. No one seemed to know
who owned either car, or how far the cars had traveled before coming to rest.;
   Ingland said he had seen the tornado coming, watched it grow stronger and
more menacing as it approached.;    "That cloud was so big, so dark," he said.
"We just kept hoping the thing would lift up, but it just kept coming and
coming.";    During the day, he and his wife and friends had packed up what
could be salvaged from the wreckage, and not all the news was bad. The clothes
were dirty but could be cleaned. He had found his wallet. They had found all
of his wife's jewelry on the floor. And, of course, they were alive.;    "I'll
tell you what, I'll never own another house that doesn't have a basement," he
said.;    Fickle destruction;  As with almost all twisters, there was a
certain fickleness about this one. Ingland's living room was destroyed, but a
statue remained untouched on the fireplace mantel. Only one dish fell from
Alberta Wheeler's china hutch, while a piece of lumber pierced her wall only a
few feet away.;    At Suzie Storrer's, the family was able to find her
husband's wedding ring and her engagement ring -- but not the refrigerator or
washer and dryer.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>HESSTON, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least a dozen tornadoes Tuesday battered
south-central Kansas, killing a 6-year-old boy and another person,
injuring 14 others and extensively damaging more than 100 homes,
authorities said.
   Tornadoes also blew through sections of Iowa, Oklahoma and
Nebraska, causing widespread property damage, but no serious
injuries, authorities said.
   In Hesston, authorities were searching for two missing people.
   The town of about 3,000 poeple ``took a direct hit and there is
major damage,'' said a dispatcher with the Kansas Highway Patrol in
Wichita.
   Gov. Mike Hayden traveled to Hesston, which was left without
electricity.
   About 40 percent to 50 percent of the town sustained major
damage from the tornado, and debris was strewn everywhere, said
Phillip Kloster, manager of the nearby town of Newton who was
helping at the command post in Hesston.
   Thirteen people hurt in the Kansas twisters were taken to the
Newton Medical Center, about eight miles south of Hesston, said
spokeswoman Chris McKellip. Most had scratches, cuts and bruises.
   A 56-year-old woman who'd been traveling through Hesston when
the twister struck was treated for a broken arm at Wesley Medical
Center in Wichita, said a hospital spokeswoman.
   A dozen tornadoes touched down within a wide area of
south-central Kanas after 4:30 p.m., and continued into the
evening, said Highway Patrol Trooper Martin Berneking.
   ``We have approximately between 75 and 100 homes that have been
anywhere from completely destroyed to fairly seriously damaged,''
said Hesston city administrator Jay Wieland. At least five
businesses were destroyed and 15 were damaged.
   ``Surprisingly, we have very few people at this point who are
reported missing,'' Wieland said. ``We have temporary housing set
up at the high school and at the college. We have National Guard on
their way in now to help secure the area.''
   About 50 people went to Hesston High School's gym to spend the
night, said Principal Marvin Estes.
   The 6-year-old boy died at a home south of Burrton, which is
about 15 miles southwest of Hesston, when a chimney and fireplace
collapsed into a basement, said Harvey County Sheriff's
Investigator Byron Motter. Another child suffered minor head wounds
in the basement, where seven people had sought shelter from the
storm.
   Another person died in a home near the small town of Goessel,
which is about 10 miles northwest of Hesston, said Marion County
Sheriff Ed Davies. The victim's name was not released.
   In Hesston, the home of Charla Buscher, 14, was seriously
damaged by the twister.
   ``We're all really shook up,'' said Charla. ``A lot of the
houses here are leveled ... We had a car wash. It's gone.
   ``The northwest corner of Hesston is just, it's gone,'' she
said. ``There's nothing left. It just looks like as if it's just
starting construction''
   At a Pizza Hut, about 15 customers and employees took cover from
the storm in a walk-in freezer and two bathrooms, ``the two safest
places in the building,'' said restaurant supervisor John Anderson.
The storm tore the roof off the restaurant, but no one was injured.
   ``I was outside and I heard it roaring,'' said Dennis Eck, an
employee at a gas station, ``I flipped switches and we hit the
deck. The pumps are all torn up. We've got roof damage.''
   Eck said businesses north of his service station were
demolished, and that the post office suffered extensive damage.
   Civil Defense workers were on the scene. Initial reports said
the worst damage in Hesston was on the western edge of town.
   Wieland said power would be restored in a day and a half to two
days, and that emergency repairs were being made to water service.
   In the small eastern Iowa town of Worthington, a tornado
destroyed the fire house, 10 homes and three businesses, disaster
officials said. Fifty residents left homeless sought shelter with
the Red Cross.
   About 10 miles southwest of Worthingin, a twister leveled at
least three houses and damaged 13 farms, said Disaster Services
Director Dianne De Sotel.
   ``People were spotting them everywhere,'' she said.

   Rescue workers alternated between
exhilaration at finding the living beneath beams and shattered
glass and despair over holding dead children in their arms as they
dug through the rubble left by tornadoes.
   ``It will be many nights before I have a good night's sleep
again,'' said Will County Executive Charles Adelman, who helped
comb a cornfield next to the Crest Hill Lake apartment complex.
   At least eight died at the complex Tuesday as tornadoes skipped
through several northern Illinois towns, killing at least 24 people
in Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill,
and Plainfield to the Northwest. At least 293 people were treated
at hospitals.
   Four of the dead, including a 4-month-old baby, were found flung
into the cornfield next to the nine-building apartment complex.
   ``People were literally blown out of the building,'' said Crest
Hill Mayor Don Randich. Two of the dead were found in cars nearby
and two others were found in the building's rubble.
   Six of the apartment buildings were gutted and three had parts
of their roofs blown away. Clothing, cars and appliances were
strewn across the landscape.
   ``When the storm went through ... some of the buildings were
disintegrated,'' said Lockport Fire Chief Dave Martis, who was in
charge of the rescue effort at the site.
   At least 150 volunteer rescue workers rushed to the site,
including officers from more than 30 area police and fire
departments, said Plainfield Police Chief Don Bennett.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels _ or just their hands.
   Workers searched each building twice, sifting through debris
until well after dark.
   Volunteers aided by dogs, floodlights, cranes and bulldozers
looked for bodies. A National Guard helicopter shone a floodlight
on the cornfield.
   Though some workers wanted to keep looking through the night,
Martis called off the effort at 9:30 p.m. He said it was too dark
and dangerous to continue.
   National Guardsmen and fire officials resumed the search today.
   In Joliet, four people died, including three in a subdivision
where some houses were still under construction, said Joliet Police
Chief Dennis Nowicki.
   ``I had a little baby die in my arms ... and a little girl,''
said a Joliet paramedic who did not identify himself. ``The last
thing she said was she wanted her mommy, and her mommy was laying
there next to her dead, too.''

   A rusty toaster, a child's plastic sand
bucket and some soggy clothes were just about all that an angry
twister left behind when it came to call on Carol Levenston and her
4-year-old son.
   While hundreds of other Illinois tornado victims last week stood
in line to see their insurance agents, Levenston, whose second
child is due any day, pecked through the pile of rubble she once
called home.
   ``We had just really got started here,'' said Levenston, 30.
``We thought about (insurance) but we just never expected this to
come about.''
   The tornadoes killed 27 people and demolished more than 270
homes and 14 apartment buildings last Tuesday in the small towns of
Plainfield and Crest Hill, some 30 miles southwest of Chicago. An
additional 639 dwellings were damaged.
   By week's end, many residents were meeting with insurance
agents, calling building contractors and beginning to look to the
future.
   ``We're totally covered,'' said Scott Ellerbrock of Plainfield.
   Ellerbrock joked he is ``31 years old going on 80,'' after the
storm left only two walls of his house intact. He said his
insurance agent had already issued him a check and that, for his
family, the worst was over.
   ``Take your best shot _ I can take it,'' the Dow Chemical Co.
worker said. ``I've been through hell and I made it.''
   Ellerbrock plans to rebuild on the same site _ this time a
larger house for his wife and two young children.
   Throughout the area, insurance agents scurried to meet demand
left in the wake of the twisters.Many residents praised the quick
response of their agents.
   ``They came out Wednesday morning _ figured it was a total loss
for me,'' said Richard Vogen as he carried a few chairs from his
three-bedroom home.
   Vogen said his agents issued him a check on the spot.
   Two disaster relief centers were set up by the state and federal
governments to assist some victims with loans and outright grants.
   The newly appointed director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, Wallace Stickney, toured the disaster area Monday and
visited the two centers. Stickney, who also flew over the
devastation in a helicopter, praised the quick response of federal
and state emergency workers.
   ``We may be able to beat the response by a couple of hours next
time, but I think we've set a record here that's going to be hard
to match in the future,'' Stickney said.
   It is Stickney's first major disaster since taking over FEMA two
weeks ago.
   Ron Buddecke, a regional FEMA official, said Friday that the
agency antifipates serving a lot of people with insufficent
insurance or no insurance.
   Many residents of the modest Crestlakes Apartment complex in
Crest Hill, where at least nine of the fatalities occurred, said
their losses had not been covered.
   Paul Hendrix, 30, pulled ``a pillowcase full'' of clothes from
his apartment Friday. Hendrix said his losses were compounded by
looting on Wednesday and Thursday while he was working at an auto
dealership.
   ``I couldn't even afford to take off,'' said Hendrix.
   Even for the insured, the road was not easy. In Plainfield, an
unidentified man wept as he pleaded over the phone with his
insurance company.
   ``You can't call me,'' the man said. ``I have no phone. My home
has been destroyed. I'm sorry. I'm upset.''

   More rain fell today in the saturated South after
deadly storms unleashed more than 20 tornadoes across Texas,
shattering one town and forcing hundreds to leave their homes in
low-lying areas.
   One tornado killed a woman, and four people were swept to their
deaths in swollen creeks. The body of the fifth victim, a
12-year-old boy, was found in a creek west of Ennis today. Fifty
people suffered storm-related injuries.
   Thunderstorms lingered over southeastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma
and western Louisiana this morning. Rain was forecast for today
from the Mississippi Valley across eastern parts of the Central
Plains, Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Mississippi, western
Tennessee, western Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Although the severity of the thunderstorms over Texas lessened
this morning, new flash flood watches and warnings and some tornado
watches were posted throughout the state because of the likelihood
of more rain, especially in the Houston area. A tornado briefly
touched down in Houston today, but there were no immediate reports
of damage.
   Elsewhere, the low pressure system that brought persistent rains
to the Northeast moved out to sea on Wednesday. But at least 100
families in northern New Jersey remained in emergency shelters as
they waited for the Passaic River to crest today about two feet
above flood level.
   A predawn tornado Wednesday ravaged the small Texas town of
Jarrell, killing a woman who had been asleep in her mobile home.
The twister roared through the town of 1,000 people 40 miles from
Austin, demolishing 33 houses, 12 mobile homes and 16 businesses,
said David Barham of the state's emergency management office.
   Thirty-nine homes were damaged, along with the school gym roof.
   The tornado sheared utility poles, pulled down power lines,
uprooted trees, overturned several cars and trucks, including six
tractor-trailers on an interstate and spread debris along a
seven-mile path, authorities said.
   About two dozen people were injured and treated at hospitals.
   ``I heard a bolt of lightning and it wasn't more than five
minutes before all hell broke loose,'' said W.G. Schurhammer, whose
apartment house was damaged. ``By the time I heard it, I dove for
the corner and the windows broke.''
   A tornado Wednesday afternoon cut a quarter-mile-wide swath for
as much as 30 miles through east Texas, destroying homes and
injuring at least nine people. A twister near Houston injured eight
people, authorities said.
   Another twister touched down six miles northwest of Lufkin,
destroying eight homes in Allentown, said Angelina County sheriff's
officers. At least nine people were injured, they said.
   On Wednesday, flooding forced hundreds of Dallas-Fort Worth area
residents to leave their homes. Floodwaters caused a levee failure
along the Trinity River in Dallas and rising tributaries were
forcing more evacuations today.
   ``You could hear the roar of the creek right behind our
trailers,'' said Don Reiter, who escaped high water Wednesday in
Kennedale. ``We didn't take anything because it came so fast. Our
cars are gone, our boats are gone. What we have on our back is just
what we have.''
   In south Dallas, a car driven by a 56-year-old woman stalled as
she tried to cross a bridge. Firefighters barricading the bridge
urged her not to attempt the crossing, said firefighter Dennis
Ground.
   Ground said the woman scrambled to the top of the car and was
told to stay there. But ``the water got so rough it just knocked
the car off. Whether she had been in it or on top of it, it still
would have occurred,'' Ground said.
   The body of 73-year-old Grand Prairie man was found in his
truck, which had been swept into a flooded creek branch. A man was
killed when his car was swept into McAnear Creek south of Fort
Worth.
   Rescuers plucked people from yards, trees and car tops. The
pilot of a radio station helicopter pulled two girls and their
mother from the roof of their car just before it was swept away in
a rain-swollen creek in Cleburne.
   Of the six emergency shelters opened by the Dallas Red Cross
Wedenesday, only two remained open this morning, said spokeswoman
Sandra Pomeroy. She didn't know how many people were in the
shelters, but said, ``We served 150 breakfasts today. We served 200
dinners last night and yesterday we served 300 lunches.''
   Bobby Valentine, manager of the Texas Rangers baseball team,
sought help from a radio station helicopter to reach two of his
horses that were trapped by rising waters behind his Fort Worth
home.
   He was able to lead the horses to safety, but his son's pony
drowned.
   ``It was something, jumping off the helicopter into water
waist-deep,'' Valentine said.
   In some parts of the state, more than 6 inches of rain fell,
boosting monthly precipitation totals already far above average.
The Dallas-Fort Worth area has received 9.62 inches of rain for the
month. The area average is 4.5 inches and the record for May is
13.66 inches.

   Officials in Florida and Louisiana today mourned five people
killed in storms but said they were lucky that powerful twisters
blasting out of Gulf thunderstorms hadn't caused more fatalities.
   One tornado Thursday night wracked the Florida Panhandle fishing
village of Eastpoint, killing three members of a family. It
destroyed 19 houses and narrowly missed a nursing home.
   ``We haven't found the house (where the family died) yet. Their
bodies were found several hundred yards from where the house once
was,'' said Pat McWhinnie, Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher.
   In Louisiana, cleanup efforts began today in the wake of Thursday
morning's storms. Tornadoes hit seven parishes in the southern part
of the state, killing two people in mobile homes in the town of
Grosse Tete and damaging scores of homes there and 15 miles east in
Baton Rouge.
   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' said Willie Hurdle, an
Iberville Parish official who surveyed the scene at Grosse Tete.
``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't even here
anymore.''
   About two dozen others were injured in the tornado.
   Police sealed the town off to prevent looting and used dogs to
search the rubble for bodies or survivors.
   Officials used a chain saw to free an elderly woman from the
wreckage of her home.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter. He said two
companies of Louisiana National Guard soldiers would be sent to help
authorities enforce a night curfew to discourage looters.
   Baton Rouge Fire Chief Ron Spillman said four tornadoes touched
down 19 times in East Baton Rouge Parish, destroying or damaging
almost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses.
   From 400 to 600 people lived in the destroyed or damaged
residences, Spillman estimated. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless.
   Kimberly Carver was asleep in her mobile home at the Pecue Lake
Mobile Home Park when one of the twisters ripped through the
neighborhood.
   ``Somehow, I just ended up between the mattress and box springs.
Everything in my bedroom was flying. If I wasn't between the
mattress and the box spring, I would have gotten hurt. It happened
so fast,'' Carver said.
   Authorities reported three injuries in Baton Rouge, none serious.
   Gulf State Utilities crews worked into the morning to restore
power to about 3,500 residents in the Baton Rouge area.
   John Boss, a photographer for the State-Times in Baton Rouge, and
Rita F. Gilmer were caught in the middle of the storm near a bridge
over the Mississippi River.
   ``Two houses blew up right across the levee from where we were,''
he said. ``Limbs were snapping off trees and flying all over us. We
were afraid we were going to be hit by all the debris. I was scared
to death. It was hell.''
   In Florida, Franklin County Sheriff Warren Roddenberry said
today, ``We were extremely lucky. The devastation we've had and no
more than three fatalities and two minor injuries is just amazing.''
   A grandmother, mother and son died when the tornado hit their
home in Eastpoint, about 85 miles southwest of Tallahassee.
   Most of the demolished houses in Eastpoint were mobile homes,
officials said. Eight cars and several utility sheds also were
destroyed. A hardware store lost its roof, and a boat building
business was demolished.
   ``It was monstrous _ like the tornado in the `Wizard of Oz,' ''
said Tracey Hardman after seeing the twister. ``It was awesome.''
   The tornados were the worst to hit the Panhandle in three years,
said National Weather Service spokesman Ray Lowe.
   Earlier Thursday, a U.S. park ranger was hurt when a tornado
carried away the shelter at Gulf Islands National Seashore in which
she had taken refuge. Amanda Rhodes suffered a broken arm and cuts
when she was blown 10 to 15 yards. The 20-by-30-foot wood-frame
entrance station was demolished, officials said.
   Elsewhere in Florida, another tornado ripped the roof from a
grocery store near Perdido Key, southwest of Pensacola, causing at
estimated $75,000 to $80,000 in damage, said Cheryl Lively,
spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center.
   Another tornado demolished a home near the neighboring
communities of Holley and Navarre about 20 miles east of Pensacola,
Santa Rosa County authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Tornados and thunderstorms also swept through coastal Alabama,
damaging dozens of homes, but no serious injuries were reported,
authorities said.

   Tony DeVita still clutched his ``tornado
pillow'' hours after killer storms ripped through the Raleigh area
today, killing five people and injuring about 150 others.
   The tornadoes scoured a five-mile path through the heavily
populated northern section of North Carolina's capital city and its
suburbs before leaping to neighboring counties. Along the way, the
tornadoes ripped up DeVita's town house.
   ``It sounded like a rush of water, followed by a bunch of
shaking,'' DeVita said. ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors
were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up
like someone was going to replace it.''
   DeVita, 34, grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door. He
still held the pillow during an interview at a shelter in a central
Raleigh school.
   Forty-six people stayed at the shelter after the storms hit
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.
   ``If you felt a big, hot hair dryer blowing by you and the whole
place was shaking apart and if this (pillow) was the only thing that
protected your face, you'd hold onto it,'' DeVita said, calling it
his ``tornado pillow.''
   ``I had to dig my way out'' from the corner of the room, he said.
``I was kind of buried in rubble. In fact, I later found plaster in
my ears.''
   DeVita left his town house wearing only pajamas. He borrowed
clothes from neighbors _ a pink jacket from one, gray sweatpants
from another and socks from someone at the shelter. He still was
without shoes.
   Residents of the complex where he lived were told to evacuate
because of a gas leak. Mayor Avery Upchurch said at midmorning that
the danger of gas leaks had passed.
   DeVita and others weren't allowed to drive out because of the
leak, so they walked and waited for buses to take them to the
shelter.
   Elsewhere, when the sun rose, dazed residents emerged to survey
the destruction.
   ``My God, my God,'' said Ellie Sprankel, as she stood on a ridge
for a sweeping view of her town house subdivision and an adjacent
apartment complex in north Raleigh.
   Ms. Sprankle said she had lived eight years in Illinois and was
accustomed to tornado watches and warnings but had never experienced
one.
   ``They used to tell me it's like a freight train coming, but what
it's really like is a train on top of you,'' she said.
   Carolyn Davis surveyed her two-story town house by candle light
before sunrise. A large pine tree had slammed into her roof and its
top protruded through the ceiling into a bedroom.
   ``My insurance company is going to love this,'' she said. ``One
month, I've been here just one month. I can't believe it.''
   Jerry Thornton gasped in disbelief when he saw that a section of
his town house roof was gone.
   ``I didn't need to see that,'' Thornton said. ``What a way to end
the Thanksgiving weekend.''

   Tornadoes and thunderstorms throughout the Midwest killed 14
people, injured scores and left hundreds more homeless. Ten of the
dead were in Indiana, where about 50 twisters touched down.
   The most disastrous tornado tore a five-mile swath through the
southwestern Indiana town of Petersburg on Saturday. It killed six
people, injured at least 57 and destroyed more than 150 homes.
   ``It looked to me like there had been a bombing run made right
through the middle of Petersburg,'' said Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, who
viewed the town from the air Sunday. ``I'm confident we'll rebuild,
but it will be tough.''
   Residents of the mining and farming community of 3,000 already
had been without fresh water for two weeks because of flooding that
tore through levees along the White River and severed the water main.
   Bayh, who had requested federal disaster assistance after the
floods, signed an amended request Sunday and sent it to President
Bush. Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste also asked for disaster assistance
after dozens of families in two Ohio counties were left homeless by
the storm there.
   Tornadoes also were reported in Illinois, Minnesota, Kentucky and
Michigan on Saturday.
   More deadly weather struck the Midwest on Sunday. Wind-toppled
trees killed a 21-year-old woman camper in a state park in
south-central Wisconsin and two boys, ages 6 and 8, in a town park
in the central Indiana town of Mulberry.
   In Illinois, the storm Saturday destroyed about 50 homes and
damaged more than 100, most of them in Jasper and Shelby counties.
Authorities reported one woman died.
   In Albion, Ill., a new $4 million electronics warehouse was
leveled, Edwards County Coroner Mark Curtis said.
   ``It's just total devastation,'' Curtis said. ``It's
unbelievable. Everything they tell you about tornadoes _ the roar
like a train, the wind _ is true.''
   Also Saturday, a 10-year-old boy drowned in a storm-swollen river
in Milwaukee and an 82-year-old man was killed by a wind-blown tree
branch in the northwestern Missouri town of Stewartsville.
   A tornado in Harrison, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, destroyed 20
houses and 10 businesses and damaged another 100 houses and 50
businesses, police Sgt. Carl Butler said. No serious injuries were
reported.
   Winds up to 70 mph in Kansas knocked down power lines, leaving
nearly 50,000 homes without electricity and sparking grass fires. In
Arkansas, thunderstorms dumped heavy rain, causing flash flooding
that closed roads.
   Across Indiana, officials reported eight dead and at least 150
people injured Saturday in storms that left 24 cities in 15 counties
with significant damage. Officials tracked about 50 tornado
touchdowns during a four-hour period.
   The outbreak was the worst in Indiana since a tornado barrage in
1974 killed 47 people. A series of twisters on Palm Sunday in 1965
killed 137 people in 18 Indiana counties.
   The other Indiana tornado deaths were in Bedford, in the southern
part of the state, and in Putnam County in west-central Indiana,
said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management Agency.
   Hauer said the tornadoes were particularly devastating because
they spent long periods of time on the ground. One twister, he said,
was on the ground 38 minutes.
   More severe thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked central
Indiana on Sunday, downing trees and power lines.
   Clouds of black dust blown from freshly plowed fields created
blackouts on highways in the northern part of the state, causing an
18-car pileup on U.S. Highway 31 outside South Bend. Five people
sustained minor injuries, police said.
   At least 150 homes and 18 businesses in Petersburg were destroyed
and 120 homes and 58 businesses were damaged when Saturday's tornado
ripped through town, said Al Miller, field operations coordinator
for the State Emergency Management Agency. At least 57 people were
injured.
   There was no electricity in the town, and residents were urged to
stay away from their damaged homes after dark. State police and the
National Guard staffed roadblocks at the edge of town and used
generators to shine floodlights on Main Street.
   ``We want to keep out the sightseers and looters and people who
don't need to be here,'' said police Sgt. Norm Weber.
   Petersburg resident Mary Hall, 63, picked through the rubble of
her collapsed home early Sunday. She and her husband, Clifton, had
taken cover in the basement porch when the storm hit.
   ``The insurance man told us to save what we could, but there's
really nothing left,'' she said.

   A swarm of tornadoes and powerful storms struck the Midwest with
high winds and hail, killing a construction worker, damaging roofs,
knocking down power lines and leaving thousands blacked out today.
   More than 80 tornadoes or tornado-like storms touched down
Sunday _ 32 in Illinois, 25 in Wisconsin and 22 in Iowa and one
each in Indiana and Arkansas, and at least 160 reports of
thunderstorms with wind gusts over 50 mph, some with baseball-sized
hail, the weather service said.
   One man, a 39-year-old construction worker, was killed Sunday
night when a house he was building collapsed on him in high winds
in Crown Point, Ind., about 15 miles south of Gary, officials said
today.
   Sunday marked the region's second day of violent weather. In
rural Gretna, Neb., a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter
died after a tornado struck their mobile home Saturday night.
   Storm damage reports covered eastern Kansas, northeast Texas,
from Arkansas through southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and
western Kentucky.
   In eastern Iowa, more than 5,000 Iowa-Illinois Gas &amp; Electric
Co. customers were without power for several hours Sunday, and
several thousand Iowa Power And Light Co. customers were blacked
out in the Des Moines area.
   A car show near Rockford, Ill., ended as 81-mph winds tossed
tents, debris, and portable toilets. ``One outhouse flew right past
me and then I got hit by another one as I was running away,'' said
Dwight Dunlop, 21.
   The winds toppled a 60-foot-by-180-foot big top tent and pulled
out dozens of metal stakes that were driven into the ground. A sign
reading, ``Not responsible for damage,'' was all that remained
standing.
   At Winsome Park, a nearby apartment complex, high winds lifted a
10-car garage away from the vehicles it sheltered and threw it into
another building.
   In the Chicago area, winds gusted up to 55 mph, downing trees
and wires. Commonwealth Edison officials said high winds caused
electricity to be cut off to about 40,000 people in the Chicago
area, but by midmorning power had been restored to all but about
6,000 customers.
   An air traffic controller at Chicago's Midway Airport complained
of a sandstorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway and
O'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed by the
storm.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the weather-related problems were compounded
by a major fire at an Illinois Bell switching center in suburban
Hinsdale.
   ``The regular telephone lines linking the Chicago-area (air)
control center in Aurora with the towers at Midway and O'Hare go
through Hinsdale,'' Edelstein explained. ``Both towers switched
immediately to backup communications systems, but the bad weather
was nearing Midway, so approaches there were stopped.''
   Edelstein said that after the worst of the weather passed,
planes were allowed to take off from Midway, and the airport was
reopened to approaching flights after several hours. There was
little effect on O'Hare, he said.
   A tornado touched down near Elwood, Ill., southwest of Joliet
shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, tearing the roof off a condominium,
but no injuries were reportd, the National Weather Service said.
   In East Peoria, high winds ripped part of the roof off a popular
seafood restaurant, doing an estimated $200,000 damage. Authorities
said about 225 diners were inside the restaurant at the time, but
no one was injured.
   In north-central Wisconsin, two people were hospitalized with
injuries after high winds with rain and hail struck their mobile
homes in Marathon County. The extent of their injuries was not
immediately known.
   ``We've had several roofs blown off, power lines knocked down,
numerous reports of trees down, I'd say 20 or 30 reports,'' said
Jack Burbank, a civil defense official for Columbia County, just
south of Marathon.
   Thunderstorms with high winds rumbled across the northern half
of Indiana on Sunday, damaging buildings in Benton County and
Lebanon and injuring one person when a mobile home was blown over
in Wabash County, authorities said.
   A tornado with ice cube-size hail brought down trees and power
lines Sunday near Arkadelphia in southwest Arkansas, but no
injuries were reported.

   National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as
cleanup began Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that
injured more than 50 people and damaged or destroyed scores of homes
and businesses.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he
planned to declare the town a state disaster area on Monday. He also
sent about 100 National Guardmen to prevent looting and help clean
up the town, where more than a third of the homes and commercial
buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' said Jack Loeffler,
mayor of the community in southeastern Illinois.
   In Indiana, three people were injured in one county, and another
county estimated damage at half a million dollars. In south-central
Kentucky, a twister caused at least $10 million in damage to
businesses and homes in and around Franklin.
   Tornadoes in wintertime are unusual but not unheard of, according
to officials at the National Weather Service. A tornado Dec. 24
killed one person, injured 15 and destroyed 20 buildings in two
Nashville, Tenn., suburbs.
   In Allendale, about 130 miles east of St. Louis near the Indiana
border, a tornado Saturday evening cut through a 10-block area that
makes up about half the town of 600, leveling buildings and
uprooting dozens of trees.
   Loeffler said 53 homes and nine businesses were destroyed. An
additional 28 homes were severely damaged and 30 sustained some
damage. The post office, fire station, city hall and a school were
all destroyed, he said.
   ``The east half of the town's gone,'' said Marvin Jones, an
ambulance driver. ``Most of the streets are blocked by wires and
trees and debris. ... Belongings are scattered everywhere.''
   ``It's a mess is all you you can say,'' said a resident, Linda
Griesemer.
   Six to eight people were trapped in the rubble but were rescued
Saturday evening and brought to hospitals, Loeffler said.
   ``We feel very fortunate. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no fatalities,'' the mayor said.
   About 45 people from in and around Allendale, including at least
six children, were treated at Wabash General Hospital in Mount
Carmel, said spokeswoman Elaine Shaw. Four were treated at Lawrence
County Memorial Hospital in Lawrenceville.
   Twenty-seven patients remained hospitalized Sunday at Wabash and
seven at other hospitals, Ms. Shaw said. She said some were in
critical condition, but did not know how many.
   In Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured
three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30
farm buildings in the St. Thomas area southeast of Vincennes in
southwestern Indiana.
   The injured were treated at a hospital and released.
   The twister came within a mile of a highs school, where 2,500
people were watching a basketball game when the storm knocked the
power out.
   Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged
several houses and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area,
causing an estimated $500,000 damage, said Sheriff's Deputy Jim
Baylis. No injuries were reported.
   In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in
outlying areas of Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12
million in damage to businesses and homes, Simpson County
Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday.
   ``Miraculously, no one was injured,'' Harper said after touring
the stricken areas in the community of 7,700.
   The roof was blown off an ambulance garage at the
Franklin-Simpson Memorial Hospital. Damage also was reported to 25
homes and to 15 businesses in and near Franklin.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard
troops to help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David
Adkinson, operations manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency
Services.
   About 20 military police officers from the guard's Louisville
unit were being sent to Franklin, he said.
   Minutes before the twister tore through Allendale, tornadoes hit
nearby Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said.
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
couple of homes and several farm buildings were damaged, said state
police Sgt. John Muensterman. In Albion, five buildings were
damaged, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   People whose homes were destroyed planned to stay with friends or
relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to a shelter in
nearby St. Francisville, said Wabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds.

   Here is a state-by-state look at the tornadoes and severe
thunderstorms that have killed at least 27 people, injured more
than 500 and left hundreds homeless since Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Alabama: Seventeen people were killed in Huntsville on
Wednesday when a tornado touched down just before rush hour,
causing major damage. There were 463 injuries and about 1,000
people left homeless, authorities said. Three people were injured
in an earlier tornado in Clay County in eastern Alabama.
   _District of Columbia: Heavy thunderstorms packing 50-60 mph
winds swept through the Washington area during the Thursday morning
rush hour, flooding some streets. About 10,000 customers lost
power, mostly in the Maryland suburbs. No injuries were reported.
   _Georgia: 19 people were injured, four critically, and at least
200 people were evacuated Wednesday after a tornado struck two
mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25
miles southeast of Atlanta.
   _Illinois: Strong winds Wednesday morning destroyed about 15
homes and killed one woman in St. Clair County in southwestern
Illinois. Damage was estimated at $3 million to $5 million.
   _Indiana: A tornado was spotted Wednesday afternoon around
Richmond, close to the Ohio border. It ripped the top off a silo
and tipped a semi-trailer into a ditch. The driver was slightly
injured.
   _Kentucky: The storm Wednesday left at least 28 people injured;
damage was estimated at $2.5 million or more. A storm believed to
have been a tornado cut a mile-long swath of destruction through
the town of Flaherty in Meade County. Damage was also reported in
Bullitt, LaRue, Hardin and Pendleton counties.
   _Maryland, Delaware: Heavy winds on Thursday leveled a church
building in Kent County, Md., lifted roofs from buildings in
Baltimore and cut power to tens of thousands of utility customers,
authorities said. Reports of tornado damage came from Kent County,
Md., and Hockessin, Del. National Weather Service officials were
unable to immediately confirm the reports. No injuries were
reported.
   _Mississippi: Scattered damage and power outages were reported
Wednesday after radar showed tornadoes in Neshoba and Kemper
counties in the east-central portion of the state. No injuries were
reported.
   _New Jersey: High winds and tornadoes were blamed for one death,
at least four injuries and widespread damage and power outages
Thursday. A tornado touched down in Piscataway shortly after noon,
collapsing on house and damaging 10 to 12 others. One person
suffered a minor injury. A bridge connecting Elizabeth with New
York City was closed after two tractor trailers overturned in heavy
winds; one truck driver died and a passenger was injured. Two minor
injuries were reported in Bergen County.
   _New York: A severe thunderstorm Thursday sent a tree crashing
through an elementary school roof in Newburgh, about 60 miles north
of New York City, killing at least seven children and injuring 18,
authorities said. In New York City, a woman was killed by a 12-foot
steel beam that apparently had blown off her apartment's water
tower. Tornadoes were reported in Peekskill, just north of the city.
   _North Carolina: A pair of tornadoes were reported Wednesday in
Henderson County, where a vacant house was destroyed. No injuries
were reported.
   _Ohio: High winds described by local authorities as a tornado
hopscotched across north-central Ohio on Wednesday, ripping roofs
off barns and houses, destroying farm sheds and damaging trailer
homes. One man was hospitalized from a lightning strike and a woman
was slightly injured by flying debris.
   _Pennsylvania: High winds and funnel clouds ripped off roofs and
downed trees in eastern Pennslyvania on Thursday, shattering
windows in Philadelphia skyscrapers. No serious injuries were
reported, but at least 75,000 customers in southeastern
Pennsylvania lost power.
   _South Carolina: A tornado Wednesday downed power lines and
damaged 20 houses near Greenwood. No injuries were reported.
   _West Virginia: High winds knocked over trees, ripped roofs off
houses and toppled a trailer early Thursday in Jefferson County,

   Strong thunderstorms moved across parts of the Mississippi
Valley and the Plains and Midwest on Sunday, spawning tornadoes in
Iowa and Illinois and dropping hailstones up to 2{ inches in
diameter.
   Tornado watches covering the afternoon and early evening were
issued for parts of Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Some injuries were reported as a tornado touched down at Elwood,
Ill., just south of Joliet, Sunday night, tearing the roof off a
condominium and strewing debris, the National Weather Service said.
Several other tornadoes touched down in Illinois, and aircraft were
overturned at the Rockford, Ill., airport as winds gusted to 81 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were accompanied by heavy rain and
hail from southwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota through
central and southwestern Iowa, western Missouri and eastern Kansas
into eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   More than two dozen tornadoes swept through southeast Iowa,
damaging several homes near Ottumwa and tipping over mobile homes
in Libertyville. High winds also blew tree limbs through power
lines, causing scattered power outages around Des Moines. No
serious injuries were reported.
   High winds in Talbot, Ind., about five miles east of the
Illinois border, moved and damaged a storage shed, authorities.
Several unconfirmed tornadoes were reported in southern and central
Wisconsin, where storms damaged roofs and knocked down trees and
power lines. No injuries were reported in either state.
   Late Saturday, a tornado struck a mobile home southwest of
Omaha, Neb., and killed two people.
   Hail up to 2{ inches in diameter fell just west of Lawrence,
Kan., during the morning.
   Hail as big as golfballs pelted the Iowa towns of Anamosa and
Afton, and the areas of Carlise and Indianola, southeast of Des
Moines, and parts of Kansas and Missouri.
   Wind gusts of 50 mph were clocked while the storms crossed
central Iowa and tree limbs were reported blown down at
Marshalltown. Waterloo had gusts to 58 mph and three-quarter-inch
hail, and Dubuque recorded gusts of 67 mph.
   Hail up to an inch and a half in diameter fell in Missouri's
Nodaway County, about 50 miles north of Kansas City.
   To the south, showers and thunderstorms moved into northern
Louisiana and southern Arkansas, with one-inch hail reported at
Canton, Ark. Lightning set a house afire at Lone Star, Texas, the
weather service said.
   Showers were scattered ahead of the main area of thunderstorms,
extending from southern Illinois through western Kentucky and
western Tennessee into northern Alabama. Behind the front, showers
were scattered from central South Dakota into the Nebraska
Panahndle.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered from southwestern Oregon into
the northern valleys of California.
   Muskegon, Mich., warmed to a record 83 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Rock Springs, Wyo., to 97 at Laredo, Texas. The low for
the day was 22 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Great Lakes region through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
into the lower Mississippi Valley and central Gulf Coast.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted in southwestern Wyoming; in the
80s from the desert Southwest to the southern Plains, the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys and the Southeast into Florida;
in the 90s over the Arizona deserts, and south-central Texas and
the Rio Grande Valley; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the
rest of the nation.

   Residents of three states today struggled
to recover from tornadoes that destroyed a third of the buildings in
this southeastern Illinois town and injured more than four dozen
people.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' Mayor Jack Loeffler
said Sunday from an emergency command post in a bank.
   Twisters hit the Illinois towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and
Allendale on Saturday afternoon before moving into Indiana and
touching down near Vincennes. Late Saturday, a tornado cut a
two-mile path through the southern Kentucky community of Franklin.
   Fifty people were injured in Illinois, and 22 remained
hospitalized Sunday. The three people injured in Indiana were
released from hospitals by Sunday; no injuries were reported in
Kentucky.
   ``After seeing everything that's happened, we were pretty lucky
no folks were hurt,'' said Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper
in Kentucky.
   The National Guard was sent to the tornado-ravaged areas of
Illinois and Kentucky to help with the cleanup and to prevent
looting.
   Loeffler said the tornado cut through a 10-square-block area of
Allendale, destroying 53 homes and nine businesses, as well as the
post office, fire station, city hall and a school.
   On Sunday, the National Guard and other emergency workers cleared
trees and power lines that had been knocked down and other rubble
from streets, but hadn't made much headway on houses, said Gen.
Donald Lynn.
   Police said people whose homes were destroyed were staying with
friends or relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to
shelters.
   Shocked officials and residents of this town of 600 assessed the
damage Sunday.
   ``It's a mess is all you can say,'' said Allendale resident Linda
Griesemer. ``Houses are flattened, windows blowed out, roofs gone.''
   A damage estimate was not yet available, Loeffler said.
   Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and flew over the other
affected areas. He said he planned to declare Allendale a state
disaster area.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said. The tornado ``not
only took out a third of the homes, it took out almost the entire
downtown and all the public facilities.''
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
few homes and farm buildings were damaged. In Albion, five buildings
were damaged but there were no injuries, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   In Indiana, a twister came within a mile of Vincennes Lincoln
High School, where 2,500 people were watching a junior varsity
basketball game when the storm knocked the school's power out.
   ``People are moving back into their homes and salvaging what they
can,'' Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Reitmeyer said Sunday. ``We were lucky
last night. It didn't rain anymore after the tornado, so not a lot
of homes were water-soaked.
   ``One or two homes are really damaged extensively enough that the
people won't be able to live in them.''
   Five homes were destroyed and 25 were damaged by the tornado that
hit Franklin, Ky.
   ``It came and went so quickly that some people slept through it,
didn't know it had happened,'' Harper said.
   William Huff said he went to his front door to investigate the
booming sounds of the tornado.
   ``I opened the front door, and the next thing I know, the house
was gone,'' Huff said. His two-bedroom house was leveled.

   A powerful storm rose out of the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and
surged through the South, spinning off tornadoes that ripped apart
homes, toppled trees and injured dozens of people.
   The tornadoes touched down along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi
and in several places in rural Alabama. A powerful blast of wind
also swept through Columbus, Ga., but weather officials were
uncertain whether it was a tornado.
   Heavy thunderstorms or rainshowers also were reported from
Florida to Michigan, posing a threat of floods in some places. The
wet weather was the result of low pressure that was pulling
moisture northward out of the Gulf.
   The first two tornadoes were reported shortly after midnight in
the Gulf Coast town of Pass Christian, Miss., where at least 30
homes were damaged, the National Weather Service said.
   The storm drove northeastward during the night and a tornado
touched down just before dawn in Opp, Ala., damaging more than 40
homes and two businesses, and destroying two mobile homes.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a reporter with radio
station WOPP.
   The twister knocked out power, covered streets with the mangled
remains of trees and blew out windows. Ten people were injured, one
seriously enough to be hospitalized.
   Later tornadoes were reported in Pike and Barbour counties, to
the northwest of Opp.
   Three people were critically injured in Pike County, where the
twister hit about 10 miles south of the town of Troy. It ripped
apart three mobile homes and deposited a pickup truck in a tree.
   A spokeswoman at Edge Regional Medical Center in Troy said two
women, ages 86 and 44, and a 67-year-old man were listed in
critical condition.
   At South Macon High School in Alabama's Macon County, secretary
Portia Johnson said 11 girls suffered cuts and scrapes when the
ceiling collapsed in a girl's restroom about 7:30 a.m.
   In Auburn, an elementary school was closed after two trees
crashed into the building. The high winds also leveled a U.S.
Department of Agriculture barn and tore part of the roof off the
campus police station at Auburn University.
   In Columbus, Ga., which is just across the border from Alabama,
the storm struck with tornado-like winds shortly after 9 a.m.
   The storm ripped the roof off a service station, knocked out
power and phone service in parts of the downtown area and injured
two people, who were treated for lacerations and released from the
Medical Center, officials said.
   Wind damage also was reported in LaGrange, Ga., where two mobile
homes were destroyed and about eight other homes were damaged.
Trees also were uprooted, but no injuries were reported.

park and destroyed 88 houses and 11 businesses Friday night.;    In a big

40-acre Golden Spur Mobile Home Park were killed when a tornado destroyed 226
trailers and heavily damaged 15. Earlier reports had placed the town's death

   A state of emergency was declared in
Indiana in the trail of twisters that killed at least nine people,
injured more than 100 and littered the Midwest with debris,
authorities said.
   At least 130 people were injured Saturday night in Indiana in
about four tornadoes that touched down 50 times or more in the state.
   Eight people were reported killed in Indiana and one person was
left dead in Illinois, officials said. A few of the injuries in
Indiana were critical, state officials said.
   Elsewhere, twisters or tornado-force winds downed trees, knocked
out power and damaged homes and businesses in Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh sent the state's National Guard to Bedford
and Petersburg, the two hardest hit areas in southern Indiana.
   The Indiana National Guard dispatched medical workers, engineers
and ambulances to the region, where state police set up a temporary
command post to assist injured and homeless residents.
   A temporary morgue was set up at a fire station in Petersburg, a
city of 4,000 people about 40 miles north of Evansville.
   ``It's like a war zone,'' said Ed Thurman of nearby Vincennes,
who walked through Petersburg early today to view damage.
   ``Half of the town was destroyed,'' Thurman said. ``Homes,
businesses, an elementary school. It went right down the main
street. The mayor's house was demolished.''
   Temporary shelters in churches quickly filled up in Petersburg,
where flooding two weeks ago chased people from their homes, Thurman
said.
   Randy Harris of radio station WFPC in Petersburg said he was home
when disaster struck.
   ``It was just a very strong roar, almost like a low-flying jet,''
he said.
   Phil Roberts, deputy director of the Indiana Department of
Emergency Management, said eight people were confirmed killed in
Indiana _ four in Petersburg, two in nearby Union, one in Bedford,
which is 70 miles south of Indianapolis, and one in Putnam County.
   Jerry Hauer, director of the state emergency management agency,
initially had reported three people were killed in Bedford, but
Roberts said early today that figure was based on reports from local
authorities who later changed their count.
   One woman was killed in Putnam County when her mobile home
overturned, said Hendricks County sheriff's Lt. Steve Golden.
Details on the other deaths in Indiana remained sketchy early today.
   The tornadoes were deemed the most destructive to hit Indiana
since 1974, when about a dozen twisters touched down, Hauer said.
   A woman in the small, southeastern Illinois town of Browns was
killed and at least eight people in nearby Findlay and Newton were
injured by tornadoes, officials said.
   Electricity and gas service was turned off in Findlay, where
about 800 people live, for fear of leaks. Eleven homes were
destroyed and 25 others were damaged in the area.
   Hospitals around the Bedford and Petersburg areas treated many of
the Indiana injured, Roberts said. Utility service was knocked out
in those areas. Mike Garvey, a medical specialist for the Indiana
emergency management agency, said at least 75 people were injured in
the Bedford and Petersburg areas. Fewer than ten were critically
injured, he said.
   Among the injured were 27 people in a Bedford restaurant that was
destroyed, Roberts said. A service station and convenience store
were destroyed south of Bedford, witnesses said.
   Indiana State Police in Lafayette reported extensive damage in
Montgomery County about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. At least
two tornadoes touched down in that region.
   ``Some houses are reported gone,'' state police Cpl. Dave Murray
said of Montgomery County.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Wisconsin, several thousand residents of Fond du Lac, an
eastern Wisconsin city of 36,000, were temporarily without electric
service as tree limbs tore down transmission lines. No serious
injuries were reported.
   _In Minnesota, thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph and
hail moved across southeastern and east-central parts of the state.
A tornado damaged four farms Saturday one mile east of Goodhue in
southeastern Minnesota, but no injuries were reported, authorities
said.
   _ In Ohio, a tornado damaged several homes and destroyed a
restaurant in Harrison, outside Cincinnati, the National Weather
Service said. No serious injuries were reported.
   _ In Kentucky, a tornado overturned a house trailer and damaged
three others in the town of West Liberty, and two possible tornadoes
were reported elsewhere in the state, said police and the weather
service. No injuries were immediately reported.
   _ In Michigan, a tornado touched down in Big Praire Township,
damaging some of the many vacation trailers in an area where many
retirees live, said Newago County sheriff's dispatcher Bob Bain. No
injuries were reported and the extent of the damage was not
immediately known, he said.
   _ In Kansas, winds that reached 70 mph tore roofs from homes
throughout the city of Hutchinson. Downed power lines knocked out
power to nearly 50,000 homes and sparked grass fires.

   Tornados killed a child, injured at
least 14 others and damaged scores of buildings in northern and
western Oklahoma, authorities said.
   One twister, bearing winds of 100 mph, cut a mile-long swath in
Stillwater, hitting residential areas and the Oklahoma State
University campus. At least three other tornadoes touched down in
Oklahoma Tuesday night.
   A 4-year-old was killed in Stillwater as his mother drove to a
relative's home to take shelter, authorities said. Authorities said
the mother, who was cut, was unable to explain exactly what
happened when the storm overtook them.
   Damage was reported to six apartment complexes and other homes,
businesses and schools in this town of 40,000.
   About 40 units at a housing unit on the university campus was
reported damaged, and the storm tore part of the roof off the
physical education center.
   At least seven other people in Stillwater were treated for
injuries. The worst injury was a 75-year-old man who broke a hip.
   A twister hit the ground around midnight in Foyil, injuring at
least six people as it plowed across four miles of farmland.
   A tornado ripped off a roof near Kellyville in Oklahoma, and a
twister in western Oklahoma terrorized patrons and workers inside
an El Reno truck stop when it touched down near Interstate 40.
   With power lines down, residents of Stillwater and Foyil waited
for daylight today to reveal the extent of the damage.
   ``I'm going to go back tomorrow and see what happened,'' said
Stillwater resident Jean Annesley, who spent the night in a Red
Cross shelter after her home was hit. ``It's going to kill me. But
I'll survive it.''
   Mike Field stood in his yard and looked at the wreckage from a
school roof that littered the inside and outside of his heavily
damaged house. He and his family had made it to shelter.
   ``When we were driving back, I saw a lot of trees down and
thought that maybe the trees here in my front yard would be
damaged,'' Field said.
   ``We turned the corner, the first thing I saw was the roof gone.
My wife started crying. What are you going to do?''

<HEAD>Tornado Hits Georgia; High Winds and Rain Across Alabama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A violent storm front packing tornado-like winds and at least
one confirmed tornado racked parts of Georgia and Alabama this
morning, flipping trailer homes and downing trees and power lines
and critically injuring three people.
   Initial damage reports from Columbus, Ga., where the tornado
touchdown was confirmed, were sketchy. In Alabama, authorities
reported serious damage and injuries near Opp, which was hit by
tornado-like winds shortly before dawn, and to the northeast in
Pike County,.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a radio reporter with
station WOPP in Opp, a town of 7,000 about 60 miles north of the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The storm hit the town at about 5:50 a.m., knocking out power
and covering streets with the mangled remains of trees. Witnesses
said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some
neighborhoods showed widespread damage.
   At least 15 injures were reported in Alabama. Six people
required hospitalization, including three who were critically
injured in Pike County when a twister or tornado-force winds
demolished trailer homes. The entire state remained under a flash
flood watch.
   The storm system coursed into Georgia from the southwest,
sending a tornado spinning into Columbus at about 9:15 a.m.
   ``We have no severe damage that we know about,'' said Joy
Burnham, the city's emergency management director. She said some
damage was reported at a car dealership, and some roofs and trees
were blown down.
   Phone lines were down in the downtown Columbus area, according
to Southern Bell spokeswoman Lynne Bress. Georgia Power Co.
spokeswoman Meg Reggie said only a few hundred customers were
without power.
   It was the second tornado in downtown Columbus this month. On
Feb. 10, the city was hit by one of several twisters that touched
down in Georgia during a storm.
   In northern Georgia, where 10 inches or more of rain fell on
some sections last week, the National Weather Service predicted up
to 2 inches of rain today as the storms moved through.
   ``Everybody up here's praying for good things to happen,'' said
Trion Mayor Hoyt Williams, whose town was one of the worst hit by
the earlier rain. ``I don't know what protective measures to take.
Do you?''
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris has asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster aid for nine counties _ Carroll, Chattooga, Cobb,
Douglas, Fannin, Gilmer, Gordon, Murray and Walker _ because of
recent floods and tornadoes.
   A flash flood watch issued by the National Weather Service for
today covered an area that included Atlanta, Athens and Rome.
   Harris estimated Monday that storms since Feb. 10 have killed
six people and injured 32 in the state. He said 39 homes were
destroyed, while 470 houses and 129 businesses were damaged.
   In Alabama, the most severe damage today appeared to follow a
northeast path from Opp through Pike County into Barbour County. In
Pike County, officials said four people were injured in mobile
homes and a pickup truck was blown into a tree; in Barbour County,
sheriff's deputy R.H. Johnson said four house trailers were damaged.
   Trees and power lines also were snapped off in Chambers, Lee,
Tallapoosa, Bullock and Houston counties, and the wind was clocked
at 76 mph in Dothan.
   An elementary school in Auburn was closed after high winds sent
two trees crashing into the building. No injuries were reported. A
middle school at Auburn also was closed by a power outage.

   Severe thunderstorms raked parts of the Midwest Saturday,
causing widespread flooding and at least two deaths in Iowa and
Illinois. Tornadoes destroyed five houses in South Dakota and
ripped through a Nebraska town.
   Hundreds of Iowans were forced to evacuate their homes when up
to 6 inches of rain fell over parts of the state, and roads and
bridges were washed out. An 11-year-old girl was killed when she
was swept into a culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the
Mississippi River, Scott County authorities said.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central
counties disaster areas and sent the National Guard to help sandbag
low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed.
   The Weather Service said more thunderstorms and heavy rain were
likely overnight as a front of moist, unstable air moved through
the upper Midwest.
   In South Dakota, a tornado ripped a nine-mile path through
Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls, damaging 30 to 50 homes,
said Beresford Fire Chief T.A. Mullinex. He said about five homes
were destroyed but no deaths or injuries were reported.
   In Nebraska, a tornado hit the northeastern town of Madison
Saturday night, causing widespread damage just hours after areas
had been evacuated because of flooding, officials said.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant was torn off
by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's phone. She
wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   He said there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in
the community of 2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha. Another
tornado touched down further north near O'Neill earlier Saturday,
damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of severe
storms.
   Heavy rains also lashed western Illinois Saturday. A train
engineer was killed and three people were injured when a Burlington
Northern freight engine derailed at a washed-out bridge near
Morrison, Ill., authorities said.
   ``The train collapsed the weakened bridge and the two engines
with approximately 28 cars began a chain reaction collision,'' said
a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher. ``Workers were trapped in
the engine because they came to rest in about 15 feet of water and
mud from the swollen ditch.''
   The engineer's identity was not released. The injured were
treated at a hospital and released.
   In Iowa, scattered flooding was reported throughout the state.
Branstad declared Polk, Warren, Dallas and Jasper counties in
central Iowa and Johnson, Scott and Muscatine counties in eastern
Iowa disaster areas.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The river was expected to crest at 22 feet on Sunday, 11
feet above flood stage. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter
in central Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly
higher than the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest
at Des Moines near its 1947 record.
   All roads between Des Moines and west Des Moines were blocked
except Interstate 235 and police were going door to door in
low-lying areas offering evacuation help.
   A thunderstorm packing winds of at least 80 mph struck the
Ottumwa area in southeast Iowa shortly after 2 p.m., damaging trees
and at least two homes and downing power lines.
   A new outdoor storm warning system failed when the weather
service asked officials to activate it after a tornado was sighted.
Ottumwa Police Sgt. Jim Clark said the failure apparently was
caused by an electrical power surge from intense lightning.
   Travel was considered extremely dangerous all over eastern Iowa.
   In Cedar County, motorists along Interstate 80 between Durant
and Stockton were trapped inside and on top of floating cars, a
State Patrol spokesman said.

   A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest
blew north Thursday, knocking a cafeteria wall down on top of
lunching schoolchildren in upstate New York. The two-day toll was
at least 27 dead and hundreds injured.
   The cafeteria cave-in claimed the lives of seven children near
Newburgh, N.Y., and deaths also were reported in New York City, New
Jersey and Illinois. Seventeen people died Wednesday in Huntsville,
Ala., when a tornado packing 250 mph winds struck virtually without
warning, laying waste to a wide swath of the city.
   The storm churned around a collision of record warm air and
extremely cold air. The result was tornadoes and unusually severe
thunderstorms.
   By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated
1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch
against looting Thursday.
   No bodies were believed left in the rubble, but portions of the
city resembled a bombing target. A shopping center and clusters of
apartment buildings were leveled. Cars were piled atop each other.
Utility poles had been snapped like twigs.
   The National Weather Service said the tornado path had covered
between eight and 10 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as
250 mph.
   ``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a
blender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.
   As the storm moved north on Thursday, it knocked over trees and
ripped the the roofs off houses in West Virginia, injuring four
members of one family, two seriously. The storm also caused
flooding in Washington, D.C., blew the windows out of skyscrapers
in Philadelphia and destroyed a house in Piscataway, N.J.
   A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high
winds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. A
New York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown off
a water tower.
   In Wyckoff, N.J., high winds knocked a power line onto a gas
line, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of 20 homes,
according to police. No houses were burned.
   The cafeteria collapse occurred at the East Coldenham Elementary
School in Newburgh at about 12:30 p.m., when from 113 to 125
students in first, second and third grades were eating lunch, said
Newburgh police Chief John Kulisek.
   State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit
by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not
confirm that until investigators went to the scene.
   The center section of a cinder-block and glass wall fell in on
the cafeteria, showering the pupils with glass and concrete.
   ``You are talking about huge concrete blocks that fell on top of
the kids,'' state police Lt. Robert Hughes said.
   Seven children ages 7 and 8 were killed and 18 others were
injured, four critically, officials said.
   In eastern Connecticut, more than 75,000 Northeast Utilities
customers lost power in the afternoon, and 18,000 remained without
power at 9 p.m., spokeman Jeffery Kotkin said.
   Tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio and
Indiana. A severe thunderstorm in Illinois claimed one life and
caused several million dollars in damage.
   Altogether, the storms were blamed for at least 27 deaths and
more than 500 injuries over the two days.
   In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt said he would ask President Bush to
declare Huntsville a disaster area to open the door to millions of
dollars in federal relief. Mayor Steve Hettinger said no firm
damage estimates were expected until Friday, but he put the number
of homeless at 1,000.
   Hunt assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and
help law officers guard against looting. Police spokeswoman Susan
Williamson said there had been minor looting the night of the storm
but no arrests.
   The temperature, which had risen to 73 before the storm
Wednesday, plunged into the 30s early Thursday while rescuers
worked through the night under the glare of floodlights.
   The lights, powered by generators, produced an eerie glow in a
area that was otherwise largely without power. Tall cranes lifted
the heavy rubble, while workers with flashlights picked through the
smaller pieces.
   As daybreak came, people began returning to the scene, some to
look for valuables in ravaged cars or businesses, others simply out
of curiosity. Many carried cameras or videocassette recorders.
   Police Maj. Robert Moder said there was no indication that
anyone was left in the rubble.
   ``We don't have any reports of people missing,'' he said
Thursday morning.
   Moder said 463 people were injured and more than 150 of those
required at least overnight hospital treatment. Authorities had
said 19 people were killed but later lowered the death toll by two.
   All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were
killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to
be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march. The other victim
perished on the city's outskirts, authorities said.
   Most of the dead were in apartments and stores that were torn
into twisted wreckage, or in cars blown off the pavement.
   The tornado seemed to catch everyone by surprise.
   ``It was fast,'' said Lucy Lee Rusk, who moved to a Red Cross
shelter after her apartment was battered by debris. ``It was like
one big pop and that's when everything went.''
   The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm
warning at 3:54 p.m., but the tornado struck with no real warning,
said Brenda Page of the service's office. A tornado warning was
broadcast at 4:39 p.m., two minutes after the twister was sighted
on the ground at the old Huntsville airport.
   Ms. Page said radar showed a strong storm but not the conditions
usually visible during tornadoes.
   Danny Cooper, director of the Alabama Emergency Management
Agency, said three people were seriously injured in an earlier
tornado that hit a home in Clay County in eastern Alabama. He said
a tornado in northwestern Alabama's Lauderdale County destroyed
three homes.
   Alabama Power Co. reported Thursday that violent winds had
battered the switchyard of the Farley Nuclear Power Plant near
Dothan on Wednesday night, causing about three gallons of
concentrated PCBs to spill. A spokesman said no one was injured,
the nuclear plant was not affected and a cleanup of the
cancer-causing chemicals was under way.

   National Guardsmen helped keep order Wednesday
after up to 10 tornadoes churned through Arkansas, killing six
people, damaging scores of homes and businesses and temporarily
knocking out power to 16,000 customers.
   The twisters destroyed or damaged 240 homes and mobile homes and
eight businesses, said Gary Talley, spokesman for the state Office
of Emergency Services. No monetary estimate of the damage was
available Wednesday.
   Seven counties were declared disaster areas by Gov. Bill Clinton,
who set aside $350,000 in state emergency funds.
   At least 49 tornadoes touched down in Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Iowa on Tuesday night. A seventh person was killed in
southwest Missouri. The same storm system left three people dead in
road accidents in Colorado and was blamed for the electrocution
death of a woman in Illinois.
   The National Weather Service said the storms were caused by a
cold front colliding with warm, moist air.
   ``We saw it coming, but there was nothing we could do,'' said
Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansas town of Lonoke,
where two people were killed and about 30 houses were reported
heavily damaged.
   At the height of the storm, 16,000 customers of Arkansas Power &amp;
Light Co. lost power for different periods, said AP&amp;L spokesman
Jerol Garrison. By Wednesday morning, only about 1,000 customers
still had no power, he said.
   About three dozen National Guardsmen were called out for several
hours Wednesday morning to look for survivors and keep non-residents
away from homes in the Scott area in Pulaski County. A second group
of guardsmen performed similar duties in Van Buren County.
   Three of the tornado victims, a couple and their infant son, died
when their mobile home in Scott was battered by the last of the
tornadoes to hit the state, authorities said. They were identified
as Randall Dycus, 24, Kristi Dycus, 22, and their son, Waylon, about
1.
   Robert W. McCain and Juanita A. McCain, both 62, died when high
winds overturned their van on Interstate 40 near Lonoke, and Louis
Breckel, 68, was killed in Van Buren County when the storm destroyed
his home, authorities said.
   Breckel lived across the street from the new Southside High
School gymnasium, which was destroyed, Sheriff Kenny Lee said.
   ``Luckily, most of those people where the homes were completely
destroyed were all out at a high school basketball game'' in another
county, Lee said.
   William Brown, a 25-year resident of Scott, appeared resigned
Wednesday as he viewed the twisted remains of his home, which the
tornado lifted off its slab.
   ``We'll rebuild,'' Brown said, as he waited for his insurance
agent. ``Sure, we'll rebuild. This is home.''
   Next to the house sat his pickup truck, its windows blown out and
a stick almost an inch in diameter imbedded in the dashboard.
   The trees in the area, coated with the swirling fiberglass
insulation sucked into the storm's path, looked as if they were
blooming with pink cotton, and broken glass, uprooted trees and
loose boards were strewn everywhere. Two boats, hoisted by high
winds from a nearby bayou, sat 20 yards from the shoreline.
   A twister in Garland County demolished the Lake Hamilton Fire
Department, along with a half-dozen mobile homes and a barn, and 14
mobile homes were destroyed and the roofs of several residences were
damaged in Hot Spring County, said state Trooper Janet Welch.
   In Johnson County, said Sheriff Eddie King, ``We had several
homes demolished, six to 10 homes homes destroyed _ roofs blown out,
trailer homes flipped over. Trees were just twisted up, thrown in
people's yards. Cars were picked up _ one was thrown up into the
tree.''

   A tornado swept through a central Texas town early today,
killing one person, injuring at least two dozen others and
destroying an apartment complex while residents slept, state
officials said.
   Elsewhere in Texas, serious flooding in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area forced hundreds of people to evacuate to higher ground, and
two people were killed when their vehicles were swept away in
rain-swollen creeks. Police and firefighters performed several
dramatic rescues as the severe storm system brought a second day of
twisters, hail and heavy rain to the Southwest.
   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the last
couple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' said
Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin. Their car had been washed off
the road.
   In the Northeast, showers stretched from eastern Virginia to
southern New England. There was widespread flooding in northern New
Jersey.
   The pre-dawn tornado caused widespread damage in the little town
of Jarrell, 40 miles north of Austin, when it stayed on the ground
for about seven miles, carving a mile-wide path of destruction.
   ``There was extensive damage downtown. A 15-unit apartment
complex was destroyed,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety. Williamson County Sheriff Jim Boutwell
said about 15 homes also were destroyed.
   ``It looked to me like more than one twister went through there
because there were some parallel areas'' of damage, he said.
   Several homes and businesses and the roof of the high school gym
were damaged, and at least six tractor-trailers were overturned on
Interstate 35, causing authorities to temporarily close a six-mile
stretch of the road.
   The body of a 42-year-old woman was found in the debris of a
mobile home destroyed by the tornado, Boutwell said. A man who was
in the mobile home was uninjured.
   Hospitals in Georgetown and Temples said 24 people sought
treatment and at least three were hospitalized. A police spokesman
had earlier reported 30 people injured, and it was not known if
some residents were treated at the scene.
   The Williamson County Sheriff's Department said at least three
other reports of extensive damage came from the southern and
southwestern parts of the county, where two more tornadoes were
sighted.
   In the Dallas area, a woman was killed when she drove around a
barricade and her car was swept from a bridge into a creek, and the
body of an elderly man was recovered from a truck in a creek
branch, police said.
   From 150 to 200 people were evacuated from south Dallas, 50
people from Grand Prairie, and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, police
said.
   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who
had gone to check his cattle and was stranded by rapidly rising
waters, Geeslin said.
   The tornadoes came as severe thunderstorms unleashed twisters,
flash flooding and hail across a vast expanse of Texas from the Rio
Grande to the Red River.
   ``I've been working here since 1973 and this is the worst
thunderstorm I've ever seen,'' said Warren Kneis, supervisor for
the Federal Aviation Administration at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport control tower.
   In addition to Texas, which got 7 inches of rain in some parts,
flood warnings were also issued for parts of Louisiana and
Oklahoma. A tornado touched down near Westcliffe, Colo., and huge
hail pelted Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   A weekend storm that damaged more than half of the 190 Apache
tank-killer helicopters at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, could cost
$500 million, said Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the
House Defense Appropriations Committee.
   The weather service said 19 tornadoes had been reported in Texas
since Tuesday morning.
   Gainesville, a city of 14,000 people about 60 miles northwest of
Dallas, was among the hardest hit Tuesday. National Guardsmen
helped evacuate about 150 homes in low-lying areas threatened by
floods, said state Trooper M. Dial. Most evacuees were taken out by
boat.
   Animals at Gainesville's Frank Buck Zoo were taken to a cattle
auction barn because of flooding. Eighteen deer were missing, said
Milburn Cravens, Gainesville's director of community services.
   Emergency workers sandbagged houses in low-lying areas of
Idabel, Okla., after heavy rains threatened flooding. A flash flood
watch was still in effect today for much of southern Oklahoma.
Thunderstorms also pelted the western part of the state.
   In northern New Jersey, 11 counties were under flood warnings,
after another 2 inches of rain in the past 24 hours drenched the
already saturated area.
   There was widespread flooding in the Newark area, with water 2
to 3 feet deep clogging entrances to roads and stalling cars. Eight
residents of Westwood, N.J., who live near the Pascack Brook were
evacuated early today.
   Area meteorologists said more rain has fallen in the first 15
days of May than usually falls in the whole month. Newark
registered 4.2 inches between May 1 and midnight Monday, before the
new rains began, compared with an average of 3.6 inches for the
whole month.
   Similarly, the amount of rain that has fallen in the
Baltimore-Washington area in May is well over the average total for
the month.
   The National Weather Service reported that a stretch of 13
consecutive days of rain in May through today is the longest in 40
years of record-keeping at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport. The previous record for May was nine days set in 1979.

   Tornadoes skipped without warning like a
``big bouncing ball'' across North Carolina's capital city early
Monday, smashing homes and churches before heading into rural areas.
Four people were killed and at least 151 injured.
   ``I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought `Oh God, this is
it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said Betty Bell
of Raleigh.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Monday's twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches,
toppled several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto
houses and streets, leaving more 6,500 homes without electricity for
several hours. Trees were snapped several feet from the ground along
the storm's path.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh, where the storms
struck without any advance notice, said Mayor Avery Upchurch. The
National Weather Service issued no tornado warnings or watches
before the tornadoes struck.
   Roger Friedenson, a spokesman for the Insurance News Service in
Raleigh, said insurance companies anticipated a possible loss of $30
million in North Carolina from the twisters. The 1984 storms cause
$65 million in damage.
   Joe Dean, secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety, said
twisters touched down in 17 locations in Wake, Nash, Franklin,
Northampton, Halifax, Dare, Hyde, Pamlico and Currituck counties.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   The twisters first struck around 1 a.m., flattening a Raleigh K
mart store and four three-story apartment buildings nearby at the
start of a 10-mile path of destruction in northern Wake County.
   ``We flew over the area and it looked like a big bouncing ball
had gone through there,'' Upchurch said.
   Three K mart employees in the Raleigh store when the tornado hit
were all later rescued. One man was trapped in debris and had to be
pulled out.
   ``I went to the back of the store and saw I couldn't make it,''
said K Mart employee Michelle Jones. ``I got to the toys and hid.''
   Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap
with racks of clothing and other merchandise.
   Fire departments had crews out combing through damaged homes and
apartments in search of other victims.
   However, said Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton: ``To our
knowledge, all people have been accounted for.''
   Of 132 houses damaged, a third were destroyed, he said.
   Raleigh police were posted at areas of major damage to prevent
looting, authorities said.
   The Salvation Army in Wake County coordinated donations of
blankets and clothing for four temporary shelters set up for people
left homeless.
   Tony DeVita, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex, said he grabbed a
pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed.
   ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every
window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going
to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the
corner of the room.
   The Small Business Administration has been asked to assess
damages to determine if the counties will be eligible for
low-interest disaster loans, Dean said.
   ``What we are trying to do now is assess the damage and determine
how to help people affected by the storm,'' Dean said.
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
bulk tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber,and two hog operations
were destroyed, he said.
   The victims were identified as Pete Fulghum, 12, of Raleigh;
Janet Barnes, 8, of Raleigh; and Lee Roy Alston and his wife, Mary,
of Nash County.
   Authorities first said six people had been killed. They later
said one of the deaths turned out to be unrelated to the storm. The
toll was revised downward a second time, to four, after a second
check of Wake County hospitals, the State Emergency Response Team
said in a news release.

   A tornado slammed into a shopping
district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at
least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars
and homes, authorities said.
   ``It's total destruction where the tornado hit. Cars are piled
on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to
be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in
Montgomery.
   Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths,
said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency
Management Agency in Montgomery. Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305
people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that
struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with
rush-hour traffic.
   Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble
through the night for injured or dead.
   ``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment
complexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jennings
after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the
city's south section.
   ``It may be tomorrow before we have a final count,'' Gov. Guy
Hunt said at the state's disaster center in Montgomery.
   The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with search
and rescue equipment.
   Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and
Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the
damaged area. Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plunging
temperatures.
   ``We're even having a few snowflakes,'' said Cooper. High
temperatures in Huntsville were expected to be in the 30s Thursday,
he said.
   Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the
Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were
reduced to rubble by the tornado.
   ``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' news
photographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty of
staff and pupils when the tornado hit. Police reported one person
killed in a car outside the school.
   Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square
apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College,
which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in
scattered areas.
   ``Rescuers are digging in the rubble,'' state trooper W.L. Kelly
said. He said two people were killed when the twister hit house
trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville. The fifth death was
reported near the shopping district.
   The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's
Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space
agency or weapons testing center.
   ``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,''
Kelly said.
   Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the
tornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting,
reported widespread damage.
   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and
it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold
of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when
the twister struck.
   ``It started picking cars up and pushing them around, ... some
of them upside down, some of them just strewn around,'' he said.
   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus
performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said.
   ``All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just
popping and snapping over the top of us ... it was as if you were
looking into an arc-welder, they were so bright,'' he said.
   WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a
business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area. A
nearby shopping center also was damaged.
   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors were
having difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
   The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east
Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one
home and causing some injuries. Weather officials said people were
trapped inside a collapsed house.
   A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said
people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of
Sylacauga.
   Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather
swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service
placed most of the state under a tornado watch.
   A third tornado was reported shortly before 3:30 p.m. crossing
the Coosa River near Titus in east Alabama, the Weather Service
said.
   In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at
least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home
parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles
southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.
   Authorities in southwestern North Carolina said a pair of
storm-spawned tornadoes struck around 10:45 p.m., destroying a
vacant house in Henderson County.
   The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes inflicting
minor property damage in Kentucky and Mississippi.

   A tornado blasted through this North
Florida town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a
college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving
four people dead and 15 injured, officials said.
   The tornado touched down at 4:30 a.m. just west of Madison,
about 50 miles east of Tallahassee, and cut a 12-mile swath of
destruction, authorities said.
   ``There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out
there and thought we were all gone,'' said Marie Prince, a Madison
County sheriff's dispatcher. The tornado passed only four blocks
from her office.
   Four people were killed north of town, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.
Fifteen people were injured, but none of the injuries was critical,
according to Madison County Memorial Hospital administrator Jeannie
Baker.
   A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a
baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped,
Peavy said.
   Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the
tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said
Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson.
   ``It didn't leave any of it. Not even a dish. You'd never know
there was a trailer here,'' said Dorothy Butler, sister of one of
the victims.
   Rescue units from adjoining counties were helping out, along
with state law enforcement and forestry officials. State prisoners
were also on their way to help with the cleanup, Peavy said. He had
no estimate of the damage.
   The tornado was part of a storm system that struck across the
Southeast with high winds, lightning and hail. Trees, roofs and
mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were
reported.
   Madison, a town of about 3,500 people, is the county seat of
Madison County, a thinly populated tobacco growing area of piney
woods, rolling hills and swamps on the border with Georgia.
   The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping
center and then proceeded straight into North Florida Junior
College, where it ``totaled the new library and took the roof off
the auditorium,'' Peavy said.
   The twister blew away several homes, blew the roof off a nearby
church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.
   As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado,
Peavy said. He said the tornado's sweep through town lasted under
30 minutes.
   Electric company workers were restoring power throughout the
area.
   Two tornadoes struck near the towns of Malone and Bascom, about
100 miles to the west of Madison, said Jackson County emergency
management director John Mader.
   Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes
seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured.
Many county roads were blocked by fallen trees, he said, and
officials were surveying the area by helicopter.
   The tornadoes were spawned by a belt of thunderstorms being
pushed by a cold front. Hail the size of golf balls and damaging
winds hit Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   More than one inch of rain fell in one hour this morning in
Waycross, Ga., 70 miles northeast of here, and wind gusts of 40 mph
were reported in Valdosta, according to the National Weather
Service.
   Elsewhere in Georgia, trees and power lines were reported blown
down, a barn was reported destroyed and a tin roof was blown off an
old building.
   The winds destroyed up to nine mobile homes west of Bainbridge,
Ga., Monday night, injuring three people, one seriously. The
sheriff's office said the wind left the homes in shreds. Bainbridge
is 25 miles northwest of Tallahassee.
   A 9-year-old girl from Cottonwood, Ala., was injured by
lightning as she stood near a stove at her home Monday night. The
lightning accompanied a tornado that moved through southern Houston
County about 60 miles northwest of Tallahasse.
   In the eastern Georgia's Bulloch County, six mobile homes and
one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no
injuries were reported, the weather service said.
   Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern
Georgia and 15 northeastern Florida counties until at least five
hours after the tornado hit.
   Madison County has been hit by seven tornadoes since 1959 with
only one injury reported, according to the National Weather Service.

   Thunderstorms wreaked havoc across the middle Mississippi Valley
and the Southeast on Wednesday with lethal tornadoes, wind up to
100 mph and hail up to the size of baseballs.
   At least four tornadoes pounded the Huntsville, Ala., area. One
twister smashed into a residential district, a shopping area and a
school, killing at least two people and causing dozens of injuries,
police said.
   Southern Illinois was also hard hit by the storms, with one
woman killed by a falling tree, about 20 people injured and power
lines downed.
   Elsewhere, snow fell from the northern Rockies to the upper
Great Lakes, while unseasonably mild weather continued in the East.
   People in Alorton, Ill., a village of 2,700 about five miles
southeast of East St. Louis, were injured when trees fell on their
houses or mobile homes, said Bill Gamblin of the St. Clair County
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency.
   At Parks College in Cahokia, Ill., eight miles south of East St.
Louis, aircraft hangers were twisted and flattened and small
aircraft tossed around the airport by high winds, the National
Weather Service said.
   Storms in the area generated wind estimated at 80 to 100 mph,
the weather service said.
   The thunderstorms developed along and ahead of a strong cold
front and swept eastward from Missouri and Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms crossing northeastern Arkansas whipped up high
wind which blew away metal roofing being installed on a high school
gymnasium at Lepanto and dumped hail up to 2 inches in diameter at
Leachville.
   Heavy thunderstorms, possibly a tornado, struck the north
Georgia town of Palmetto late Wednesday, causing extensive damage,
authorities said.
   In central and southwest Ohio, thunderstorms packing winds up to
66 mph destroyed barns and a trailer home and tore the roofs off
several buildings. Some injuries but no fatalities were reported.
   An afternoon thunderstorm in east-central Alabama formed a
tornado which damaged at least one home, and the Clay County
Sheriff's office said an unknown number of people were injured in
one house.
   Thunderstorms sweeping across Tennessee spun off a tornado in
southeastern Madison Country, and dropped hail as big as baseballs
north of Jackson, the weather service said.
   Hail stones as big as tennis balls fell near Huntingburg, Ind.,
the weather service said.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was
1.22 inches at Peru, Ind.
   Wind up to 65 mph damaged roofs, power lines and trees in parts
of Kentucky and Louisiana, the weather service said.
   Severe thunderstorms also developed over Alabama and South
Carolina during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a
tornado north of Greenwood, S.C.
   Other showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavy rain, were
widely scattered along the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Light snow associated with an arctic cold front extended from
eastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into western Minnesota.
Snow also fell across parts of northern Wisconsin and Upper
Michigan.
   As much as 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible by Thursday morning
along the Lake Superior shore of Wisconsin.
   Strong northwesterly wind ushering the cold air into the
north-central states gusted above 40 mph during the afternoon,
creating wind chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero.
   Snow, high wind and rapidly falling temperatures associated with
the cold front briefly produced near-blizzard conditions in
Nebraska late Wednesday morning.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued in the East with afternoon
readings in the 60s in New England, and in the 80s over Florida,
southern Texas and southern Louisiana.
   Wednesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 degrees
above zero at Ely, Nev.

   Hurricane Gilbert spun off dozens of
tornadoes in Texas that killed at least two people as the nearly
spent storm steamed inland Saturday, a ``huge rain-making machine''
with potential for deadly flooding.
   Thousands of Gulf Coast residents from Louisiana to Texas began
returning home to areas struck only a glancing blow by the main
storm, at one time the most powerful on record in the Western
Hemisphere.
   ``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history
appears to have missed us,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus
Christi.
   Texans inland braced for more twisters and flash flooding, with
as much as 20 inches of rain expected.
   A tornado Saturday evening damaged 50 homes and destroyed 15 in
Del Rio, 150 miles west of San Antonio and just northwest of the
Mexican border, officials said. Two people were treated for minor
injuries and released, but scores of others spent the night with
relatives or stayed in shelters set up in the city, said police
dispatcher Don Weaver.
   Gilbert was downgraded early Saturday to a tropical storm. At
midday, its top sustained winds were 35 mph and it was downgraded
to a tropical depression.
   A woman was killed Saturday when a tornado hit her mobile home
south of San Antonio, some 300 miles north of Brownsville. A man
died in San Antonio when a tree toppled onto his house during a
thunderstorm Friday.
   In Alabama, a man trying to cross a rain-swollen creek in
Tallapoosa County southeast of Birmingham was swept to his death
early Saturday, officials said.
   A tornado heavily damaged a San Antonio apartment complex just
after sunrise.
   ``I just heard a loud, loud roar, like the wind blowing through
the broken patio door in my living room,'' said Wes Spencer, whose
apartment was hit.
   ``I just looked out, I freaked out. The roofs were gone on the
buildings. Cars were tossed all over the parking lot.''
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros also signed a disaster
declaration for his city so Air National Guard personnel could fly
in parts needed to repair air conditioning at two hospitals hit by
tornadoes earlier Saturday.
   At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed
on the storm in the Caribbean and Mexico. An additional 200 people
were feared drowned after a river swollen by rain from the
hurricane jumped its banks and overturned four buses Saturday in
Monterrey, Mexico.
   The storm never made an expected turn to the north and spared
the Texas coast, where thousands had fled to shelters after
boarding up homes and businesses along the entire length of the
state's 370-mile coastline.
   Gilbert rolled ashore late Friday afternoon in northeastern
Mexico with 120 mph wind about 150 miles south of Brownsville,
where gusts of 82 mph were recorded at South Padre Island.
   Laurie Swayze Miller, owner of a Harlingen jewelry store, picked
up the pieces after a twister hit her shop.
   ``A policeman found a diamond ring out in the parking lot,'' she
said.
   Wind gusted to nearly 40 mph at midday at Brownsville, but
coastal residents were allowed to return to their boarded-up homes
to begin cleaning up. Damage from the hurricane itself appeared to
be minor.
   South Padre Island and Port Isabel, which had expected to
receive the brunt of the once-fierce storm when it roared ashore,
reopened to the public at noon. Other coastal cities began closing
emergency shelters.
   ``I was surprised because I was expecting a lot of water,''
Eduardo Campiran, South Padre Island city manager, said Saturday.
``We have no knowledge of significant damage. Most of the damage is
like roofs, windows, awnings, this kinds of stuff.''
   South Padre Island Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr. estimated the storm
would cost local businesses $3 million to $5 million in lost
tourist revenue but said he expected business to be back to normal
by next weekend.
   Only a few low-lying coastal roads remained closed because of
flooding.
   The greatest damage appeared to be to trees, with many uprooted
or missing branches.
   ``It just trimmed the trees a little and that's about it,'' Ron
Reynolds, 31, said as he cleaned up around his home. ``My neighbor
back there had a tree go through a fence. We came through it real
lucky.''
   At 11 a.m., the National Hurricane Center put the storm center
220 miles west-southwest of Brownsville and 45 miles southwest of
Monterrey, Mexico, moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.
   Tornado and flash flood watches and warnings were posted for a
26-county area of southern Texas.
   Inland rainfall of 10-15 inches was likely with up to 20 inches
possible, forecasters said.
   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rain to the Rio
Grande Valley before heading north up the Mississippi Valley as a
``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center.
   In the 24 hours up to 7 a.m., Brownsville received 4.53 inches
of rain. In Louisiana, Reserve reported 5.7 inches in 24 hours.
   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley
and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,
forecasters said.
   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''
Zimmer said.

<NOTE>Eds: Iraan is cq, 2nd graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms spawned about 10 tornadoes from Minnesota to
Texas, killing two people and injuring 19. Late spring snow fell in
the Rockies.
   One twister late Friday near the west Texas town of Iraan caused
nine car accidents, and two people were killed. Mike Cox of the
state Department of Public Safety said the tornado apparently struck
cars on a highway.
   Fourteen people were injured in the accidents, including two
state troopers cut by flying glass when high winds blew out the
windows of their patrol car. Five more people were injured when a
house collapsed, authorities said.
   The twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the water
supply in nearby McCamey, where officials warned 2,400 residents to
conserve water.
   Also in Texas, a storm raked the Dallas-Fort Worth area with
winds of up to 60 mph and dumped 2 inches of rain in about 20
minutes, the National Weather Service said.
   The latest storms come after spring storms and some of the worst
flooding Texas has seen in 50 years killed 13 people and forced
about 10,000 from their homes. Forty-six counties have been declared
disaster areas.
   An unseasonable cold front pushing past the Rockies on Friday
caused the turbulent weather.
   Other tornadoes were reported late Friday in Wyoming, Nebraska,
South Dakota and Minnesota, the National Weather Service said.
   In northwestern Minnesota, stong winds thought to be a tornado
damaged at least three farms and felled trees near Felton.
   Forecaster Mark Ewens in Fargo, N.D., said the winds in Minnesota
were most likely a gust-front tornado, a rare twister that forms
ahead of storm fronts.
   ``They're small, weak tornadoes that nonetheless cause a lot of
damage,'' Ewens said.
   In South Dakota, twisters were spotted in central and eastern
parts of the state, but no damage was immediately reported. Severe
thunderstorms also crossed the state, bringing up to 3 inches of
rain in some areas.
   Severe thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes and golf-ball size
hail in central Nebraska, the weather service said. Five farm houses
were heavily damaged in Merna, and minor damage was reported
southwest of Sargent.
   A funnel cloud was spotted near Cheyenne, Wyo., but dissipated
quickly and no damage was reported. But thunderstorms dumped as much
as 4 inches of rain.
   Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains and was expected in northern
Colorado mountains.
   ``It is unusual for this time of year. It's not inconceivable,
but it is unusual,'' forecaster Jim Hatten said.

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers crawled through collapsed homes
and shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a
3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and
leaving 1,000 homeless.
   ``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a
blender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob
Caraway, whose specialty is cave rescues. He was among those called
out to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of the
dead.
   The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in
an arc spanning at least seven states from the Deep South to the
Midwest. The other tornadoes caused at least 19 injuries and
far-flung property damage.
   In Huntsville, teams with cranes and floodlights searched for
the injured or dead, hampered by wind-whipped rain and temperatures
that plummeted overnight from 73 degrees into the 30s.
   Gov. Guy Hunt sent 50 National Guardsmen to help and said he
would view damage Friday. His spokesman, Terry Abbott, said aerial
surveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25-mile path, much of
it straight through Huntsville.
   By this afternoon, severe thunderstorms were crossing the
Northeast. The National Weather Service put out a tornado watch for
parts of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,
all of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts,
Vermont and New Hampshire.
   In Pennsylvania, the weather service said it received
unconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knocked
down trees and power lines near Gettysburg.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Georgia, 19 people were injured, four critically, and at
least 200 people were evacuated after a tornado strus.C., and a tornado
toppled trees, downed
power lines and damaged 20 houses near Greenwood, S.C. No injuries
were reported in either state.
   _Tornadoes caused minor property damage in Mississippi, Kentucky
and Indiana.
   _In West Virginia, high winds believed to be tornadoes swept
Jefferson County early today, overturning trailers, blowing roofs
off homes and downing power lines, authorities said. Four people
were injured, two seriously.
   _Heavy thunderstorms destroyed at least a dozen homes in
Alorton, Ill., killing one person and injuring 20 others, five
seriously, authorities said.
   The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warning
Wednesday afternoon as the city's streets grew busy with the
approach of rush hour. In a matter of seconds, cars were hurled
through the air and crushed, and apartments and stores looked as if
they had been bombed.
   ``It was fast,'' said Lucy Lee Rusk, whose apartment was
battered by debris. ``It was like one big pop and that's when
everything went.''
   The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch earlier
in the day, but did not issue a more urgent tornado warning until
4:39 p.m. CST, when the tornado was spotted at the municipal golf
course. By then, it was already tearing up the city.
   A watch means a tornado is considered possible, while a warning
means a tornado is believed to exist.
   Huntsville Police Maj. Robert Moder said this morning that 463
people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school
and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
   Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at
19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll was
lowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies. She said
police had no firm reports of people missing.
   No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters
were in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were
reported injured. Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or
cars.
   Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000
and said officials were preparing a request for federal disaster
assistance.
   A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said
42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of
the survivors as ``shock, mostly, and disbelief.''
   ``They're thankful to be alive and they're thankful their
families are alive,'' he said, adding that the shelter had received
calls from around the country from worried relatives.
   The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed
22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency
management director in Montgomery.
   Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were
flipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees. The
roadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by
emergency workers treating the injured.
   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors had
difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
   Those in the tornado's path spoke with awe of its fury.
   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and
it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold
of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car.
   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus
performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said. ``All of these heavy
arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the
top of us. ... It was as if you were looking into an arc-welder,
they were so bright.''
   Kenneth Lenhard had undergone an operation at the Crestwood
Hospital on Wednesday and returned to his room about an hour before
a window in the next room blew out as the tornado passed.
   ``There wasn't anything I could do, so I covered my head,''
Lenhard said. ``I thought, `What the heck, I'm already half dead.'
''
   The downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford
Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to
rubble.
   Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by the
time the twister hit.
   The city is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the
Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from
the space agency or weapons testing center.
   At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuring
at least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.
   Near Palmetto, Ga., resident Jeff Bryant said his home at the
Sweetbriar Mobile Home Park near Interstate 85 began to vibrate
when the twister approached.
   ``Then we heard a large, loud, swirling and humming noise,'' he
recalled. ``It didn't sound like a train like everybody says it
does. I lived near a train track. It did not sound like a train. It
sounded more like a jet aircraft at very close range.''
   Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.
``It was picking up cars and tossing them like toys off the
interstate,'' he said. ``I saw one 18-wheeler flip over. The car in
front of us was flipped about 100 yards, and the guy was thrown out
of his passenger window and landed 50 feet from his car.

<HEAD>Tornado Deaths Below Average in '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the
tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as
changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters.
   Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even
so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation.
   In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59
killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99
fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.
   But while that's good news, it isn't an indication that the
danger has lessened.
   ``There is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring,
but the way to survive is through preparedness,'' said Ed Ferguson,
deputy director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in
Kansas City.
   Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in
recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are
most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.
   Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a
record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the
country. The average for November is only 23 tornadoes, and the
record had been 81, set in 1973.
   Last year also recorded the largest tornado outbreak in 14 years.
That took place on Mother's Day when 57 twisters tore through parts
of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. That outbreak didn't
cause any deaths, although 10 injuries were reported.
   Arkansas and Tennessee recorded the most fatalities last year
with six deaths apiece, followed by Florida with five. Four people
were killed in North Carolina and two each in Mississippi and
Nebraska. States with a single fatality apiece were Kentucky,
Michigan, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.
   The transition from winter to spring, spurring unsettled weather
and frequent thunderstorms, helps create tornadoes, violently
twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds.
   After a low point in the winter they begin to increase sharply in
March and peak in May with a national average of 166 twisters in
that month, according to records kept at the National Climatic Data
Center.
   June ranks second, averaging 150 tornadoes, followed by April
with 109 in a typical year. Other months averaging more than a
twister-a-day somewhere in the nation are July, 82; August, 57;
March, 50 and September, 38.
   Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their
tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon
and sunset, according to the National Center for Atmospheric
Research. Tornadoes are least likely during the early morning just
before sunrise.
   The typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about
two miles on the ground _ 87 percent of the time heading toward the
northeast, NCAR researchers report.
   But while an individual twister can cover only a small area, they
often come in groups and in the affected area destruction can be
total.
   The familiar funnel cloud is the most common sign of a tornado
although adjacent winds can also cause severe damage.
   When twisters are in an area, common sense and knowing a few
simple rules can save lives, the National Weather Service says.
   If tornadoes threaten, turn on radio or television to keep
current on the danger, the agency says. The weather service even has
its own radio network which can provide continual updates. If a
twister is reported, safety rules include:
   _At home, seek shelter immediately in a basement or interior
hallway. Stay away from windows and outside walls.
   _At school, move to hallways and lie flat on the floor with head
covered.
   _In a mobile home or trailer, leave immediately. Head for a
secure shelter or lie flat on the ground. Be wary of areas with poor
drainage, however, because of the possibility of flooding from the
thunderstorm.
   _At work or in public buildings, head for interior hallways on
the lowest floor, or designated shelter areas.
   _In an automobile, leave immediately. Do not try to outrun a
tornado.

   Tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Gilbert
caused more than $35 million damage in this inland southern Texas
city apparently harder hit than coastal cities that faced the main
storm, officials said Monday.
   ``It's amazing to me that no one was killed. This is far worse
than anything in Brownsville,'' Gov. Bill Clements said here after
touring ravaged areas of both cities. ``There is no place anywhere
that suffered this kind of damage.''
   Two people were killed in the 41 tornadoes that leap-frogged
across the state. Heavy rain swelled rivers in some areas, but no
injuries were reported.
   Clements said he would wait for county officials to send him
damage estimates before taking steps for a disaster declaration and
sending requests for aid to the federal government.
   A federal disaster designation would let businesses receive
low-interest loans to rebuild and some residents would be placed in
temporary housing for a certain period, said Ed Hargett, regional
director for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Earlier, Clements viewing damage in Brownsville on the southern
tip of Texas, which felt part of the hurricane's wind and waves.
   ``I think that all of us feel a sense of relief that we are
blessed that there is no more damage in Texas and more particularly
here in Cameron County than you have experienced,'' Clements said
after flying over waterfront areas at Brownsville.
   What little was left of the hurricane was moving across the
Midwest toward Illinois, leaving heavy rain in its wake.
   ``I don't think we are expecting much more in the way of trouble
from Hurricane Gilbert,'' said Laureen Chernow, spokeswoman for the
state's Emergency Management Council in Austin.
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros toured tornado-ravaged areas
Sunday, and said he wanted to extend his state of emergency
declaration through Friday.
   The declaration will enable the city to try to seek assistance
from the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies.
   ``I don't want to deny anyone potential help,'' Cisneros said.
   Twisters that raged through a residential area in the border
town of Del Rio caused an estimated $1 million damage, but no
injuries late Saturday, officials said.
   In Corpus Christi, two sea beaches in county parks were closed
because they had about $100,000 damage, Nueces County Commissioner
J.P. Luby said.
   ``The foredunes were extensively damaged,'' he said. ``The tide
went in and melted them away like butter.'' Foredunes along the
beach protect larger interior dunes from erosion.
   Luby, who said he would seek federal assistance in the park
cleanup effort, said county jail inmates will help clean up timber
and other debris and repair damage to the foredunes and parking
lots.
   But San Antonio, which opened up shelters for Gulf Coast
residents fleeing the pending storm, seemed to have suffered the
worst damage.
   One man was killed Friday when a utility pole struck his house
and a woman was thrown from her mobile home by a tornado.
   The storm system then spawned a tornado that cut a path through
Kelly Air Force Base, causing $3 million damage to 12 buildings and
an additional $25 million to aircraft parts.
   Another tornado destroyed the air-conditioning system at the
Veterans Administration Hospital, causing $2 million damage and
prompting Cisneros to issue the emergency decree so equipment could
be flown in and to avoid moving some 700 patients.
   Another tornado struck The Lodge apartments, destroying about
120 units, damaging 264 others and leaving 300 homeless. Other
twisters hit residential and businesses areas, causing about $5
million damage, officials said.
   Heavy rain caused the Rio Grande to rise about 30 feet from Lake
Amistad outside Del Rio to alcon Lake in Zapata.
   ``It didn't pose any problems because boaters were warned to get
off the river,'' Ms. Chernow said.

   Tornado-shocked victims tried to put their
shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of
twisters that killed four people, including a couple found with
their arms wrapped around each other.
   At least 17 tornadoes were reported early Monday, covering 200
miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people and causing
more than $50 million in damage.
   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark and
Vera Cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across the
street.
   ``I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know,
we are flying,'' said Cimerro. ``It was like a ride at the fair.''
   Their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured.
   A neighbor, 8-year-old Janet Barnes, died when a chimney
collapsed on her bed.
   Further north in Raleigh, 12-year-old Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum died
of head and chest injuries.
   In rural Nash County, Lee Roy Alston died with his arms wrapped
around his fatally injured wife, Mary, apparently in an effort to
shield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home,
authorities said. They had been thrown from the mobile home. Their
two children, ages 14 and 8, survived.
   Authorities had put the death toll at six, but later corrected it
to four.
   The tornadoes struck in nine counties, from Wake in the center of
the state, to Dare on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said. Most of
the damage was in Raleigh, where tornadoes cut a 10-mile swath.
   City Manager Dempsey Benton said the storm caused about $50
million in damage in Raleigh, the state capital. With about 85
percent of estimates completed, about 152 businesses and residential
buildings were destroyed, 301 buildings received major damage and
644 buildings minor damage, he said.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh.
   Damage estimates from other counties were not compiled.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Gov. Jim Martin asked the federal Small Business Administration
to declare Wake County a disaster area.
   The American Red Cross in Wake County got so many offers of
assistance that the agency ended up turning away some would-be
volunteers. Organizations rallied to supply everything from free
legal advice to tips about home repairs.
   The twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppled
several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses
and streets.
   A K mart store was flattened by the twister, and six Raleigh
residents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday with
looting the store.
   More than 6,500 homes were left without power, but by Monday
night electricity had been restored to all but 1,100 customers of
Carolina Power &amp; Light, said spokesman Kyle Hampton said.
   By nightfall Monday, most of those whose homes were damaged had
found somewhere to spend the night, either checking into hotels and
motels or staying with friends and relatives, authorities said.
   Only 17 people from five families spent the night at a Raleigh
middle school, the only shelter in Wake County, said Gloria Brown of
the county Department of Social Services.
   More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by
the storm, said Helen Sibley, nurse coordinator for the local Red
Cross chapter.
   ``That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she
said. ``People in the city don't think other people care much about
them, but when something like this happens, we come together.''
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations were
destroyed, Graham said.
   There were also losses of livestock in Wake, Halifax and Nash
counties.
   ``If federal disaster status is appropriate, I'll press for it
with all I've got,'' Graham said.
   The National Weather Service did not begin issuing tornado
warnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down in
western Wake County because the twister was too close to radar to
monitor, authorities say.
   ``If you are looking straight up at a storm you can't see much,''
said Rod Gonski, a meteorologist with the weather service at Raleigh
Durham International Airport.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   At another scene of tornado damage, officials in Ruleville,
Miss., have decided there will be no classes for children there for
at least a week and preparations will be made to move high school
students to an empty building in a nearby town.
   A tornado cut a 60-foot-wide swath through Ruleville on Saturday,
destroying six homes and damaging the Delta town's three public
schools and other structures.

   Crews using bulldozers, dump trucks and
front-end loaders today began clearing away the debris left by a
tornado that devastated this farming community's commercial strip
and a trailer park.
   Twelve people were injured, but warning sirens apparently averted
more serious casualties.
   Lincoln County sheriff's deputies and other public safety
employees conducted a house-to-house search today; afterward, they
said they believed every resident was accounted for.
   Officials estimated that the twister damaged 90 percent of the
downtown district and more than half the residences of this eastern
Colorado plains town.
   One grain silo was flattened like a beer can. Most of the town's
structures were twisted masses of metal and wood, and several
railroad cars were overturned.
   The sirens wailed for 10 minutes before the twister struck
Wednesday night, giving residents time to take shelter, officials
and survivors said.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who flew to the shattered town on a National
Guard helicopter early today, said he would seek a federal disaster
declaration.
   ``The business district is 50 to 75 percent destroyed,'' he said,
adding that damage was likely to run into the tens of millions.
   The town, 80 miles east of Denver, is known for helping
blizzard-stranded travelers forced off Interstate 70.
   It was without water, but limited electricity and telephone
service were reported restored by late morning, officials said.
   National Guardsmen brought bedding, food and other supplies.
   The town hall, a bank, a supermarket, a video store and a
nightclub were destroyed along Main Street.
   Most of the businesses were closed at the time; 10 people in the
nightclub were saved by taking refuge in the bar's cooler, a witness
said.
   Three guests at the Lariat Hotel piled into their bathtub and
pulled a mattress over themselves after the sirens went off.
   ``We were doing a lot of praying in that bathtub,'' said David
Thomas, 27.
   The tornado tore their room apart. ``It felt like somebody just
reached down and squeezed your whole body. My eardrums were coming
out,'' Thomas said.
   Most of the 20 to 25 homes at a trailer park on the edge of town
were damaged or destroyed, resident Bernard Goetz said.
   ``It's a lot of havoc, a lot of destruction, a lot of homes gone
out there,'' Goetz said.
   Two people were hospitalized; one was reported in serious but
stable condition with a fractured pelvis.
   The tornado spun out of thunderstorms that swept the plains east
of Denver with heavy rain and baseball-size hail. The National
Weather Service said nine other tornadoes touched down on the plains.
   In eastern El Paso County, two people were trapped in a mobile
home for about two hours after it was hit by a tornado late
Wednesday, Sgt. Dean Kelsey said. Both were hospitalized in Colorado
Springs.

   Midwesterners mourning neighbors killed in a deadly barrage of
tornadoes were hit Sunday by a second onslaught of thunderstorms and
high winds that raised the weekend weather death toll to 13.
   Wind-toppled trees on Sunday killed a camper in Wisconsin and an
8-year-old boy in a town park in Indiana, the state that bore the
brunt of the fierce weather that began Saturday night.
   Across Indiana, officials reported eight dead and at least 150
people injured Saturday in the state's worst tornado outbreak since
1974. The storms left 24 cities in 15 counties with significant
damage. Officials tracked about 50 tornado touchdowns during a
four-hour period.
   In Illinois, a tornado Saturday destroyed or damaged scores of
houses and killed one woman. Also Saturday, 10-year-old boy drowned
in a storm-swollen river in Milwaukee and an 82-year-old man was
killed by a wind-blown tree branch in the northwestern Missouri town
of Stewartsville.
   Twisters or high winds downed trees, knocked out power and
damaged homes and businesses from Kansas to Michigan and Ohio. In
Arkansas, thunderstorms dumped heavy rain, causing flash flooding
that closed roads.
   In the second round of deadly weather Sunday, high winds at a
campground in Rocky Arbor State Park in south-central Wisconsin
toppled a tree onto a tent, killing a 21-year-old woman and injuring
another woman in the tent with her another, according to the Juneau
County Sheriff's Department. The injured woman, 24, was hospitalized
in fair condition.
   In the central Indiana town of Mulberry, a 60-foot-tall felled by
80 mph wind blew down on three boys who were visiting Centennial
Park for a picnic, said Town Marshal Bruce Welton. The freak
accident killed an 8-year-old boy and left a 7-year-old boy in
critical condition and a 10-year-old boy in guarded condition,
hospital officials said.
   Severe thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked central
Indiana on Sunday, downing trees and powerlines, but no serious
damage or injuries were immediately reported.
   Clouds of black dust sucked from freshly-plowed fields by 40 mph
winds created blackouts on highways in the northern part of the
state, causing an 18-car pileup on U.S. Highway 31 outside South
Bend. Five people suffered minor injuries, police said.
   The most disastrous of the many tornadoes to touch down Saturday
ripped through the southwestern Indiana town of Petersburg, killing
six and leaving hundreds homeless just two weeks after floods
knocked out the town's fresh water supply.
   The other Indiana tornado deaths were in Bedford, in the southern
part of the state, and in Putnam County in west-central Indiana,
said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management
Agency. Hauer, who was unable to provide details of the deaths, said
said his staff had received reports that 150 people were injured
statewide.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh toured Petersburg and Bedford and viewed
other damage from the air on Sunday.
   At least 150 homes and 18 businesses in Petersburg were destroyed
and 120 homes and 58 businesses were damaged when the storm ripped a
five-mile path through town, said Al Miller, field operations
coordinator for the State Emergency Management Agency. At least 57
people were injured.
   ``The tornado clearly cut right through the middle of town,''
Bayh said. ``It looked to me like there had been a bombing run made
right through the middle of Petersburg.''
   Residents of the mining and farming community of 3,000 had been
without fresh water for two weeks because of flooding that tore
through levees along the White River and severed the water main. A
temporary pipeline carries water from a nearby power plant, but it
was unsafe to drink without boiling first.
   The Rev. Jeff Stratton said the townspeople had kept their sense
of humor despite the added hardship.
   ``I've joked with some friends here that I've heard from reliable
sources that tomorrow it's frogs and locusts,'' he said.
   Petersburg resident Keith Burch had just sat on the couch when
the tornado hit. He said he had no idea what was happening.
   ``The windows blew in and I started crawling into the bedroom,''
he said. ``The refrigerator blew up against me and pinned me against
the wall. That's probably what saved me. The rest of the house blew
in.''
   Elsewhere over the weekend:
   _ In Illinois, 30 homes were destroyed and at least 70 damaged in
Jasper County, while Shelby County reported 12 homes demolished and
26 others damaged. A 54-year-old Edwards County woman was killed
when a twister destroyed her home.
   _ In Ohio, a tornado damaged 100 houses homes and some 50
businesses in Harrison, outside Cincinnati, and up to 20 houses and
10 businesses destroyed, police Sgt. Carl Butler said. No serious
injuries were reported. At least 30 airplanes were damaged or
destroyed and one of three hangars was flattened at the Cincinnati
West Airport in Harrison, said Tim McKenna, whose family owned the
airport.
   _In Wisconsin, several thousand residents of Fond du Lac, an
eastern Wisconsin city of 36,000, were temporarily without electric
service as tree limbs tore down transmission lines. In Milwaukee,
searchers Sunday found the body of a boy, 10, who slipped into the
Menomonee River shortly after storms swept through the area the
previous evening.
   _In Minnesota, thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph and
hail moved across southeastern and east-central parts of the state.
A tornado damaged four farms Saturday one mile east of Goodhue in
southeastern Minnesota, but no injuries were reported.
   _ In Kentucky, tornadoes struck several counties, damaging homes,
tossing mobile homes, downing trees and knocking out power. At least
five people were injured, none seriously.
   _ In Michigan, a tornado touched down in Big Prairie Township,
damaging some of the many vacation trailers in an area where many
retirees live, said Newaygo County sheriff's dispatcher Bob Bain. No
injuries were reported, and authorities were unable to provide
detailed description of the damage.
   More than 110,000 homes and businesses were blacked out Sunday
because powerlines were downed by thunderstorms and high wind that
hit the state late Saturday and early Sunday.
   _ In Kansas, winds that reached 70 mph tore roofs from homes
throughout the city of Hutchinson. Downed power lines knocked out
power to nearly 50,000 homes and sparked grass fires.

   Midwesterners mopped up or continued battling flood waters
Sunday after tornadoes, thunderstorms and flooding hit parts of the
region, killing an 11-year-old girl in Iowa and a railroad engineer
in Illinois.
   Tornadoes that roared through South Dakota and Nebraska on
Saturday left damaged or destroyed farm buildings and homes and
uprooted trees in their wake. Up to half a foot of rain fell on
already-sodden ground in Minnesota and Nebraska.
   In eastern Iowa, Clear Creek jumped its banks, closing a
two-mile section of Interstate 80 on Sunday. Flooding knocked out
water service to the small town of Manning in the western part of
the state.
   Damage to just the eastern Iowa cities of Bettendorf and
Davenport along the Mississipi River was $21 million, officials
estimated.
   Heavy rains caused the collapse early Sunday of the roof and
part of a wall at the K&amp;M Manufacturing sheet metal plant in
Marshalltown in central Iowa. No one was at the plant at the time,
and there were no injuries.
   Eight inches of rain have doused Iowa over the past week; some
parts of the state got more than 5 inches of rain in a matter of
hours, said forecaster Scott Truett of the National Weather
Service's Des Moines office.
   Weather service flood specialist Ed May said some rivers were
still rising but predicted there wouldn't be much more flooding
beyond farmland.
   ``It's not unusual to have flooding in June. June's a wet
month,'' he said. ``What's unusual is the extent. We've got almost
all of the rivers in two-thirds of the state above flood stage.
That's kind of rare.''
   Michaella Aguiler, 11, was killed when she was swept into a
culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the Mississippi
River, authorities said.
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central counties
disaster areas on Saturday, and sent the National Guard to help
sandbag low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed. Guard
soldiers remained on flood duty on Sunday.
   Heavy rains lashed western Illinois on Saturday. Thirty-two cars
of an 88-car Burlington Northern freight train derailed when a
waterlogged embankment gave way near Morrison, killing the engineer
and injuring three other railway workers, officials said.
   Train workers were trapped in the engine because the locomotive
car they were in came to rest in about 15 feet of water and mud,
said a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher who refused to give
her name.
   The engineer was identified as Samuel Jiardina, 61, of La
Crosse, Wis. The injured were treated and released. Damage was
estimated at $2.1 million, including about 600 feet of damaged
track.
   Scattered thunderstorms pounded parts of northern and
west-central Illinois on Sunday night, but no damage or injuries
were reported.
   In southeastern South Dakota, a tornado hit so fast Saturday, it
knocked out power before warning sirens could be activated in most
areas. The twister left a nine-mile-long, three-mile wide trail of
destruction, but no injuries were reported.
   The tornado damaged 30 farms, five of them seriously, said Fire
Chief T.A. Mullinix in Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls.
One home lost its roof, Mullinix said. The twister also knocked
down power lines and several buildings and barns in Alcester 10
miles east of Beresford.
   Alcester Police Chief Kevin Booker said he got to activate
warning sirens for a few seconds before power was lost.
   Millinix estimated that damage could total at least $1.2 million.
   In northeast Nebraska, cleanup began Sunday in Madison following
a Saturday night tornado that caused widespread damage just hours
after 60 to 80 people had been evacuated from the other side of
town because of flooding, officials said. Accompanying torrential
rains caused widespread flooding throughout the northeast part of
the state.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant in Madison
was torn off by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's
phone. She wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   There were no reports of deaths or injuries in the community of
2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha.
   Another tornado touched down farther north near O'Neill earlier
Saturday, damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of
severe storms.
   In the southern Minnesota city of Fairmont, heavy rains flooded
streets because sewers were unable to keep up as winds gusted to 60
mph, the weather service said.
   Flooding also hit the basement of Fairmont Community Hospital,
which had to be pumped out by the fire department, said a hospital
supervisor who refused to give her name. The water posed no threat
to patients, she said.
   ``It looked like hurricane winds for a while,'' the supervisor
said. ``It was really bending the trees.''

   Here are some tornado facts from the National Weather Service,
Insurance Information Institute and news accounts:
   _Tornadoes can occur in any month, but are more frequent from
April through June and between 3 and 6 p.m.
   _Most tornadoes track southwest to northeast, but their paths
can spiral erratically.
   _The portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where
tornadoes are most likely to occur.
   _There were 32 tornado-related deaths reported in 1988, down
from 59 in 1987 and well below the average of 99 a year.
   _Less than 2 percent of all tornadoes are classified as violent,
with wind speeds of more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26
miles. The longest tornado on record went 219 miles across
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in March 1925.
   _Tornadoes travel at an average 30 mph, but can stand still or
go 70 mph.
   _The largest single outbreak of twisters on record was in April
1974, when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over two days.
   _When a tornado threatens, seek shelter in the basement or
central parts of the house, office or school building, away from
windows.

   Tornadoes slammed four Northeastern states Monday, killing at
least one person in Connecticut, injuring scores more and ripping up
dozens of homes and businesses. Thousands were left without power
and at least 200 people were believed homeless, officials said.
   Tornadoes wreaked havoc in two upstate New York towns and a Long
Island village, around three central Massachusetts communities and
in northwestern and coastal Connecticut. Twisters, which are unusual
in the Northeast, were also reported in northern New Jersey.
   Intense thunderstorms boomed over New York's Long Island and
Westchester County, producing damaging winds, hail and lightning.
Scattered storms also fell over southeastern New York, southern
Connecticut and northern New Jersey.
   The New York twisters cut a narrow path through the Putnam County
towns of Carmel and Brewster 30 to 40 miles north of New York City.
A separate tornado hit the Long Island village of East Moriches,
said Suffolk County fire communications spokesman Jay Sardone.
   Two people were treated for cuts from shattered glass and two
people were injured in separate auto accidents during the storm,
said Putnam Hospital Center spokeswoman Marjorie Schneider. One of
the car crash victims was admitted to the hospital, but his injuries
were not believed to be life threatening; the others were treated
and released.
   Both the Putnam and Long Island hospitals were operating on
emergency generators.
   About 10,000 Long Island Lighting Co. customers were without
power, the utility reported. ``It's a complete wipeout,'' said
utility spokeswoman Sue Roschak.
   A tornado tore off roofs and walls in a 250-unit condominium
development in Carmel, severely damaging 35 homes and damaging 35
others, said Putnam County spokesman Ken Lott. Red Cross spokesman
Larry Mackler estimated 200 people were left homeless.
   ``You're looking at these condos and the front walls are just
gone,'' said Eric Gross, a reporter for radio station WVIP who lives
in Carmel.
   ``You can look in and see their furniture on the second floor,''
he said. ``People told me they heard this horrible wind, looked
outside their windows, grabbed their kids and ran into the basement.
There are trees, five, six and seven feet in diameter that snapped
like matchsticks. Cars overturned and others were crushed.''
   Gross, who was on the outskirts of Carmel when the tornado hit,
said the storm lasted no more than two minutes.
   The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter at Carmel High School
with 200 cots, but virtually no one had gone to the shelter by early
Tuesday. People either stayed at the development to keep watch on
their property or stayed with friends and relatives, Lott said.
   Hundreds of Putnam County homes were without power and utility
crews were out working on downed power lines, said spokesman Mark
Welte of New York State Electric &amp; Gas, which serves the area.
   The Long Island tornado roared through a private airport,
demolishing a trailer that housed a skydiving school and injuring a
man inside. A small airplane was destroyed and several were damaged.
The man was hospitalized in good condition.
   In central Massachusetts, a series of ``mini-tornadoes'' knocked
out power and telephones, felled trees and damaged homes in the
Princeton, Steling and West Boylston areas.
   Most of the damage, however, was in woods, said Tom Holmes, chief
meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Worcester station.
   No injuries were reported.
   About half of West Boylston, a town of about 6,000 people, was
without electricity or phone service.
   More than 3,000 people in western Massachusetts were also without
power, said John Gustavsen of Northeast Utilities.
   Mini-tornados are small tornados 50 to 100 feet in length that
touch down briefly. Holmes termed the storm a ``super-thunderstorm.''
   In 1953, a tornado in Worcester and surrounding areas killed 90
people.
   In Connecticut, tornadoes were reported in Bantam in the state's
northwest corner and in the New Haven and Hamden areas, where the
mayors declared states of emergency. Heavy rain and golfball-size
hail fell in some areas.
   Waterbury Mayor Joseph Santopietro imposed a 10 p.m. curfew to
keep curious townspeople from hampering the storm cleanup. The city
also opened a shelter at Kennedy High School for those whose homes
were damaged.
   At least five homes in Hamden were destroyed and an industrial
park damaged when a tornado wound through the town around 5:30 p.m.,
police said.
   A 12-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on the tent she
was in at Black Rock State Park in Watertown in west central
Connecticut, state police said. Three other girls in the tent, part
of a church group from Stratford, were injured and taken to
hospitals in Waterbury.
   Thirty-seven people were treated in New Haven hospitals or minor
injuries, and 27 people were treated at Waterbury Hospital for
mostly minor injuries, although several people suffered broken
bones, officials said.
   More than 112,000 people in northwestern and southern Connecticut
were without power, said spokesmen for Northeast Utilities and
United Illuminating.
   ``Every crew we have is on the road and then some,'' said United
Illuminating spokesman Robert Fort, who estimated it would take 24
hours to restore power to all customers.
   Some the approximately 600 National Guardsmen on duty Monday
night were dispatched to Hamden and Waterbury to help assess the
damage, said Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Gov. William A. O'Neill.
   In northern New Jersey, twisters left behind downed electrical
wires and fallen trees, but no injuries were reported.

   Hurricane Gilbert's remnants swept from Texas to Illinois today
with heavy rain and flooding that forced evacuations in one
Oklahoma town. The storm earlier spun off 41 tornadoes and killed
three people in Texas and Oklahoma.
   The low-pressure system that last week was the strongest
hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere spread showers and
thunderstorms along a line toward the northeast, with gusts to
about 40 mph this morning.
   The storm system itself picked up speed to about 45 to 50 mph,
said Dan McCarthy, of the National Weather Service.
   ``It's scooting,'' said McCarthy, of the Severe Storms Center in
Kansas City, Mo.
   Meanwhile, workers in Monterrey, Mexico, searched for the bodies
of up to 200 people swept away when a river swollen by hurricane
rains poured over its banks and overturned four buses. Ninety
bodies were recovered and a total of 191 people were confirmed dead
in the aftermath of Gilbert outside the United States.
   Late Sunday, the storm moved over Wichita Falls, Texas, with
rain and high wind, and today it was over eastern Oklahoma.
   An area west of Wichita Falls was deluged with 4{ inches of
rain, and roads in Ozona, in western Texas, were under water. The
mass of moisture extended to Chicago.
   Parts of Oklahoma received up to 8 inches of rain in two days,
causing minor flooding.
   About a dozen residents of a low-lying area in Kingfisher,
Okla., evacuated late Sunday, and others were told to be ready to
leave. Kingfisher Creek was expected to rise as much as 4 feet
above flood stage today, said police dispatcher Lois Darling.
   ``It's already a foot past flood stage and rising,'' Ms. Darling
said early today.
   Elsewhere in Oklahoma, a 50-year-old pilot from Santa Fe, N.M.,
was killed late Saturday when his plane broke apart while flying
near Muskokee, northeast of Oklahoma City, in heavy rain produced
by Gilbert, authorities said.
   Although the brunt of the hurricane missed the U.S. Gulf Coast,
at least 41 tornadoes spun off by the storm damaged homes and
businesses in Texas.
   The Rio Grande River in southwest Texas was expected to rise to
12 feet above flood stage.
   In San Antonio, a man was killed Friday when a twister knocked a
utility pole onto his home, and woman died early Saturday after a
tornado ripped through her mobile home.
   ``We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and eventually
we'll get our own house put up if we get some money to buy lumber
and tin,'' said Deborah Dickens, whose mother-in-law, Emily
Dickens, was killed.
   Other tornadoes in San Antonio uprooted trees, snapped power
lines and tore off roofs. Damage there was estimated at more than
$35 million, including $25 million harm to aircraft parts at Kelly
Air Force Base.
   Sylvia Sulsh, 54, said she was taking a shower early Saturday
when a tornado struck her apartment at a San Antonio complex where
at least 120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and 300
tenants left homeless.
   ``I got out of the shower and braced myself against the door and
then I saw the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. Sulsh said.
   Mayor Henry Cisneros said the city was lucky the death toll was
low.
   Crews restored power and telephone service Sunday and removed
debris from streets, while those whose homes were damaged made
repairs.
   The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the
Caribbean, including 29 in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where it hit
with winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in
the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
   Offshoots of the hurricane produced heavy rain over the Florida
Panhandle last week and miles of roads and bridges remained flooded
today around the city of Milton, about 30 miles northeast of
Pensacola. So far this month, Pensacola has recorded 11.7 inches of
rain; normal rainfall for the period is 4.6 inches.
   The Blackwater River at Milton rose above its banks for a second
time in as many weeks Saturday, damaging about 40 houses and 20
mobile homes, said Tom Roche, civil defense director for Santa Rosa
County. The first round of flooding was caused by rain associated
with Hurricane Florence.
