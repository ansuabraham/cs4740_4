<HEAD>Dallas Museum to Store Stolen Medieval Art Until Ownership Settled</HEAD>

   The heirs of an American soldier accused of
pilfering medieval art treasures from a German church during World
War II have given the trove to a Dallas museum for safekeeping
while their ownership is settled.
   The Quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the
Dallas Museum of Art until the ownership is decided by a U.S.
District Court judge, museum director Richard R. Brettell said
Thursday.
   Brettell said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see
the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree. The
public likely will get to see the art once ownership is clear.
   ``Each party was interested in eventually displaying the art for
the people in Texas,'' Brettell said.
   The pieces will be moved from rural Whitewright, about 60 miles
north of Dallas, to the downtown museum within a week, he said.
   The Lutheran Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde church of Quedlinburg
claims that Joe T. Meador stole the trove while his U.S. Army unit
was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the brother and
sister of the soldier, have been negotiating with the church to
have the treasures kept in a neutral place while they haggle over
ownership.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his
siblings. The heirs claim to have several, but not all, of the 14
treasures sought by the church. The treasures include a 9th- or
10th-century wood reliquary, a container; a jeweled ivory-and-gold
comb; a Byzantine rock crystal flask; four small reliquaries in the
form of turrets, and a small heart-shaped reliquary.
   Two jeweled medieval manuscripts believed held by the Meadors
for several years were sold recently on the European art market.
   Brettell said he did not know how many objects the museum would
receive. He said they included gold, silver, ivory and crystal
articles from the 8th to 14th centuries.
   ``The Quedlinburg treasury is undoubtedly the most important
Carolingian treasury of the Germanies,'' he said. ``The objects
were made for important kings. They were in a repository which was
among the three or four greatest medieval repositories.''
   The Carolingian period refers to the reign of emperor
Charlemagne and his successors in the 8th through early 10th
centuries.
   Brettel refused to assign a value to the treasures.
   ``Important Carolingian objects have not traded hands on the
open market for the last generation and therefore it's impossible
to give a real and correct evaluation,'' he said.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Art Crime Update:
   German Booty in Texas

   An American soldier's theft of German church treasures at
the end of World War II began to surface this April. The New
York Times reported that a government-funded German
foundation had paid a $3 million "finder's fee" for the
Quedlinburg Gospels, a magnificent illuminated Carolingian
manuscript written in gold. The seller reportedly had
threatened the manuscript would be sold to a Japanese buyer.
John S. Torigian, a Dallas attorney acting for anonymous
clients, had arranged the transfer in Switzerland through
Heribert Tenschert, a Bavarian dealer in rare books and
manuscripts. Reaction to the sale was mixed. While pleased
that the Gospels might return to their home when
reunification takes place, many were incensed at the
extortion and disturbed by the secrecy of the seller's
identity.
   The Gospels and other medieval works of art from the
Quedlinburg cloister's treasury were stored for safety in a
mine shaft outside Quedlinburg in 1945 when American troops
approached. The U.S. Army knew treasures were missing, but by
1949, Quedlinburg was part of the Russian zone and later East
Germany, and the Army dropped its investigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among medievalists, the disappearance of the Quedlinburg
treasures was considered a major war loss. The convent had
especially beautiful things, 10th- and 11th-century gifts
from the Ottonian imperial family. The medieval works from
Quedlinburg now in Texas include a silver reliquary with
enamel plaques and carved ivory panels, a small group of rock
crystal vessels, crucifixes of gold and silver, and a carved
ivory comb.
   Shortly after the sale of the Gospels, Willi Korte of
Berlin's Prussian Cultural Heritage administration traveled
to the U.S. and followed a trail to the town of Whitewright
in northeast Texas, and to its bank, where heirs of Lt. Joe
T. Meador, who served in the unit that occupied Quedlinburg,
had deposited the treasures as collateral for a loan. Meador
apparently stole more than 10 works from the Quedlinburg
treasury. Witnesses who served with Meador have come forward
to tell of the theft from the mine shaft. Meador died of
cancer in 1980.
   The Church of Quedlinburg has brought suit in Federal
District Court in Dallas to recover the items, and the West
German government will foot the legal bill. A restraining
order will keep the treasure safe until its ownership is
determined. Meador's sister and brother are defendants and,
along with Mr. Torigian, subjects of a criminal investigation
seeking to discover whether they knew the objects were stolen
before transporting the manuscript to Switzerland for sale.
It later was reported that the IRS also is looking into their
possible tax liability, putting additional pressure on Jane
Meador Cook and Jack Meador to settle this deeply
embarrassing situation.

   In mid-July, Judge Vincent L. Broderick denied the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's motion to dismiss a 1987 lawsuit
filed by the Republic of Turkey to recover more than 200
ancient silver and gold artifacts that Turkey calls the
Lydian Hoard and the Met labels "East Greek." Turkey claims
the objects were plundered from a burial mound in Ushak and
smuggled out for sale. Although almost 20 years had passed
since the Met acquired the objects through purchases totaling
more than $1 million and through gifts from the two dealers
who made the sale, the court ruled that the museum could not
use the statute of limitations defense. Turkey's assertion
that the Met was not a good-faith purchaser needed to be
tested, the court ruled, adding that the museum may have been
aware of the artifacts' illicit export and may have
deliberately concealed their acquisition. The ruling cleared
the way to trial.

   Van Gogh's centenary exhibition in Amsterdam just closed
after drawing 1.2 million visitors, who admired, among other
paintings, three van Goghs from the Kroller-Muller Museum
recovered by Dutch police earlier this year. Meanwhile,
however, the Noord Brabant Museum in nearby s'Hertogenbosch
suffered the theft of three paintings from the artist's early
years in Nuenen. On the night of June 27, a window was
broken, the alarm system failed, and in the morning the
museum discovered it was missing works it values between $2.7
and $5.4 million.

   On July 4, Paris lost three paintings from three museums.
A small Renoir portrait of a woman, on display near a
staircase in the Louvre's Pavilion des Flores, was cut from
its frame during museum hours. About an hour later, the theft
of Ernest Hebert's portrait of "Monaluccia" was discovered at
the Musee Hebert, a small museum on the Left Bank. It too was
cut from its stretcher without tripping the alarm attached to
the frame. A third picture, a landscape of 1816 by Paul Huet,
was discovered missing from the museum of the city of Paris,
the Musee Carnavalet.
   Reaction was swift. The next day Jacques Sallois, the
director of the national museums, announced an unusual
decision: Five small museums in Paris would close until
further notice. In addition to the Musee Hebert, the Gustave
Moreau, Eugene Delacroix, Ennery, and Jean-Jacques Henner
museums will admit visitors only in pre-arranged groups and
for lectures. These museums were the homes or studios of the
artists, and the security staff in each could only be
described as minimal. Increased security was announced for
three of the capital's most popular tourist attractions, the
Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, and the Palace of Versailles.

   Print dealers in the Los Angeles area are relieved that
the Doremus twins, Paul Drake and Kevin, are in police
custody. The brothers allegedly worked together, one
distracting gallery staff while the other took prints, then
rolled or folded them, before the two left the gallery. The
"system" then required a visit to a paper conservator to
repair the damage and to alter the edition numbers. Once
framed, the stolen prints were consigned for auction.
Cooperation among victims, specialists at Butterfield's
auction house and Detective William Martin of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Art Theft Detail resulted in the arrests
and several felony counts for the brothers.

   The Quedlinburg Quagmire

   Forty-six years after an American soldier took medieval
treasures from the cave where they were stored, his heirs --
almost $3 million richer as a result of their brother's
misdeed and a German foundation's willingness to pay -- have
agreed to return the precious objects to Germany. The
settlement did not, however, "settle" all the issues in this
momentous repatriation, and the flap should continue on other
levels and in other jurisdictions.
   The parties to the Dallas lawsuit announced earlier this
year that they were settling out of court. "Final wording has
yet to be worked out," said Thomas R. Kline, who represents
the Quedlinburg church and Germany's Cultural Foundation of
the States. After the settlement, the art is expected to be
exhibited for two months at the Dallas Museum of Art before
it makes the return voyage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The soldier's heirs want the church and the foundation to
tell U.S. authorities that they are content with the return
of the objects, an implicit request that the government not
pursue the defendants. Transporting the manuscript to
Switzerland for sale may have been a violation of the
National Stolen Property Act, and estate taxes may have been
due on the treasure, but no charges have yet been brought.
Final wording might characterize the exchange of Quedlinburg
treasures for cash as something other than a sale, putting
the money outside the reach of the IRS. A private settlement,
however, would not be binding on U.S. government officials.
   Last spring, the Cultural Foundation of the States agreed
to pay a "finder's fee" of $3 million for Quedlinburg's
Samuhel Gospels, a highly important luxury manuscript of the
Carolingian period. The seller represented Jane Cook Meador
and Jack Meador, the brother and sister of the soldier who
died in 1980. The transaction was widely reported and led to
the discovery of more objects from Quedlinburg in a bank
vault in Whitewright, Texas, the Meadors' hometown. The
priceless works were there as a collateral for a loan. The
Quedlinburg church then sued for their return. The settlement
assures both sides an end to a long legal wrangle of
uncertain outcome. The Germans will get all the Quedlinburg
objects that were in the bank for somewhat less than they had
agreed to pay for the Gospels manuscript alone.
   In agreeing to pay the heirs of a thief, the German
foundation has opened itself to further "offers" from others
who possess Joe T. Meador's war booty. He gave an unknown
number of objects to friends and casual acquaintances in his
social circle in Dallas. If charges are not brought against
the heirs, what will deter the others from trying to arrange
similarly lucrative exchanges?
   It is hoped that the liturgical objects will return to
Quedlinburg, the medieval cloister to which they were given
by the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries. When
added to the 20 still in Quedlinburg, the 10 objects from
Texas would almost restore the treasury to its original size.
A suitably secure housing to display the newly famous works
is needed, an expensive proposition for a poor East German
town. The treasure would undoubtedly compensate for these
costs by attracting tourists and scholars to Quedlinburg.
   In a parallel turn of events, a March settlement for
"undisclosed consideration" allowed a Hans Baldung Grien
drawing, missing since World War II, to be carried back to
the Netherlands. It was returned by the estate of Ian
Woodner. A year ago, the Netherlands announced that it was
actively seeking the return of works from a collection of old
master drawings formerly belonging to financier Franz
Koenigs, who fell on hard times in the early '30s. The
government published a fully illustrated catalog of the 526
missing works from this superb collection of more than 3,000
drawings, which was purchased for the Museum Boymans in
Rotterdam from Koenigs's bankers as they fled from Hitler's
advance.
   The drawings soon caught the eye of Hitler's grand
acquisitor, Hans Posse, director of the Dresden Picture
Gallery, who was amassing art for the Fuhrer's proposed
museum in Linz. As the military prospects of the Third Reich
dimmed, Hitler shelved his museum plans and stored the art in
a Saxon castle. When the Soviets liberated the area,
thousands of works of art were carried to the U.S.S.R. The
Koenigs drawings are believed to be there too, but some
surfaced in the West in the early 1980s, and the Netherlands
realized that a major effort would be timely, given the new
openness in the Soviet Union.
   The drawing in question, a "Virgin and Child" by the
16th-century German master, turned up in the prominent New
York collection of Ian Woodner. The Netherlands approached
Mr. Woodner to ask for its return; rebuffed, it brought suit.
As is common, the trial was delayed by procedural motions,
and, indeed, a time-consuming translation of voluminous Dutch
documents and legal statutes was under way when Mr. Woodner
died. His heirs decided not to continue the fight.
   One of the fascinating issues that might have been
determined in trial is whether the decrees of the Dutch
government in exile, declaring invalid such sales of national
treasures for worthless Reichmarks, would have been
recognized by a U.S. court.

   An ancient marble Jupiter Capitolinus, just 10 inches
tall, was stolen from the Daedalus Gallery on Manhattan's
57th Street last fall. It was recovered, only three blocks
away, in March. That morning, Judith Nugee, a Christie's
expert in antiquities, was in New York reviewing possible
consignments. She was leafing through the January issue of
IFAR reports and recognized the Jupiter she had just examined
in storage.
   Christie's counsel, Patricia Hambrecht, called IFAR with
the news, then telephoned Detective Joseph Keenan of the New
York Police Department to come to collect the object. Later
that afternoon, Daedalus's director, Thomas Swope, identified
the sculpture in police offices. Christie's then asked the
would-be consignor to come in to sign a contract, and upon
leaving the auction house, the suspect was met by the police.
After questioning, the police arrested him; the man is said
to be cooperating, and the investigation continues.

A priceless 9th-Century manuscript of the Gospels that disappeared near the end 
of World War II will return to Germany, a government-run foundation said today. 
</P>
<P>
The manuscript, called the Samuhel-Evangeliar in German, disappeared in April, 
1945, in the town of Quedlinburg, apparently after U.S. military forces 
discovered an underground cache of artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The manuscript is now in Switzerland," said Erika Lancelle, an official with 
the foundation. It represents "one of the masterpieces of Carolingian (8th- to 
late 9th-Century) book illumination," the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
Lancelle said there will be a formal ceremony in Berlin to mark the 
reacquisition of the manuscript, the name of which she translated as Samuhel 
Gospels. It comes from the year 842 and is named after the scribe who wrote and 
elaborately decorated it. 
</P>
<P>
Lancelle said that a German antique dealer bought the manuscript from an 
American lawyer and that the priceless Gospels were then bought by the 
foundation. The foundation called the $3 million it paid a "finder's fee." 
</P>
<P>
It was not explained how the lawyer acquired the Gospels.

<HEAD>Trail of Art Treasures Reads Like Hollywood Script</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lost treasure. International intrigue. A lone
adventurer.
   The script for a Hollywood movie? Nope, this is a job for Willi
A. Kotre, an investigator who followed a trail of musty documents,
Cold War secrets and just plain luck to discover the lost treasure
of the Quedlinburg Cathedral in East Germany.
   ``But please, don't call me Indiana Jones,'' the soft-spoken
German said.
   The 36-year-old Kotre, a researcher for the Prussian Cultural
Heritage Foundation in Berlin, in May pinpointed a local bank as
the place where a dead former U.S. Army officer's heirs were
keeping the missing gifts of Germany's earliest kings.
   Now, the art's original owner, the Lutheran Church of
Quedlinburg, is suing the family of former Lt. Joe T. Meador for
return of the treasures. Meador died in 1980, bequeathing the
artwork to his brother, Jack Meador, and sister, Jane Cook.
   Lawyers for the church contend Meador stole the treasures in the
final days of World War II, mailed them to the U.S. and kept them
in his hometown of Whitewright, about 60 miles north of Dallas.
German officials want to bring the artwork home as a symbol of
German reunification.
   ``It is very difficult to take a historical account and
successfully trace a missing item to an individual,'' Korte said.
``Usually, you need some kind of postwar event _ like someone
trying to sell the art _ and then you have a case.
   ``That's what happened here.''
   An East German who helped in the case, Gunter Wermusch, told The
Dallas Morning News in a telephone interview from Berlin that Nazi
officials hauled the cathedral's treasures into the cave as Allied
troops approached in early 1945.
   Soon after Korte's search began, a London book dealer offered
one of the missing treasures, a 9th-century illuminated manuscript,
to the researcher's employer.
   Officials said the $9 million offer was rejected in late 1988
because of the price and potential problems from buying art taken
from another country. But it provided a clue that the dealer
apparently worked for a U.S. resident, they said.
   Korte said he began looking for detailed accounts of Army units
near Quedlinburg in April 1945. Spending months in the National
Archives records tracing U.S. operations, he then went to the
National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, the military's
service records repository.
   More than 1,000 names of soldiers assigned to the area were
found by Korte in over a week of research. He then turned to East
Germans and medieval art experts for further clues.
   Bavarian manuscript dealer Heribert Tenschert in February was
offered the illuminated manuscript, which had been in Europe
without a buyer for two years, the newspaper said.
   Tenschert said he relayed the offer to the Foundation of the
States, a private German cultural group. The foundation paid $3
million to Houston attorney John T. Torigian in April for the
manuscript, said Aoachim Fischer, a foundation director.
   Torigian termed himself a proxy for an unnamed U.S. client,
Fischer said.
   Dealers left out of the sale immediately began talking, said
Korte.
   ``Eventually, I learned the name of the bank, and it was short
work once I had that,'' he said.
   In May, Korte went to the First National Bank of Whitewright,
which was holding the artwork for the Meador family. Bank president
John Farley said he talked with Korte but gave him no information
about the treasures.
   Checks of his lists and a call to a Grayson County veterans'
group produced Joe Meador's name, said Korte. The Germans
negotiated in successive weeks with the bank and Torigian, who
represents the Meador family, the foundation said.
   But talks stalled on June 16, when word surfaced of a second
manuscript in Switzerland that was offered for $500,000.
   A Dallas judge has barred movement of the artwork.

   IRS Says Stolen Art Treasures Are Subject to Estate Tax

   After Joe Tom Meador of Whitewright, Texas, died in 1980,
his sister, serving as his executor, filed a state
inheritance-tax return showing an estate of about $120,000 in
stock, real estate and life insurance.
   The amount was too small to require a federal estate-tax
return. However, it failed to take account of Mr. Meador's
secret hoard of religious and art treasures that he stole in
Germany and France at the end of World War II while a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army artillery. At his death, the
stolen art passed to his heirs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Meador cache included medieval manuscripts and
reliquaries from the Quedlinburg, Germany, cathedral. It came
to the attention of the public in 1990, when Mr. Meador's
heirs sold a ninth-century illustrated manuscript of the four
Gospels to a foundation representing the Quedlinburg church
for a "finder's fee" that some reports say was as much as $3
million.
   Now the Internal Revenue Service claims that the stolen
works are subject to federal estate tax. In a private ruling
dated last Aug. 30 that has just come to light, the IRS also
declares that:
   -- The value of each item for tax purposes is the price it
would have brought, at the time of Mr. Meador's death, on the
open market -- including the illicit market of international
traffickers in stolen art.
   -- The estate isn't entitled to reduce its taxable value
by deducting recovery claims made by the Quedlinburg church
and other theft victims against Mr. Meador's sister and
executor, Jane Meador Cook, of Mesquite, Texas, and their
brother Jack, of Whitewright. The two siblings inherited the
stolen art. The IRS contends they knew something of its
origins and value.
   Attorneys for the heirs say they would have income-tax
liability for any money received in settling the recovery
claims or disposing of the art objects. But the attorneys
insist that there can be no estate tax on Joe Meador's
estate, because he never had legal title to the treasures.
   The IRS position is that Joe Meador had the economic
equivalent of ownership of the objects for 35 years and at
his death was able to transfer the same benefits to his
heirs. While the IRS found no such precedent in estate-tax
law, it said Joe Meador clearly would be treated as the owner
under income-tax law and, therefore, must be for estate-tax
purposes.
   But, says Randal Mathis, a Dallas lawyer for the heirs,
"We think the ruling is in error, and we're quite confident
that in the long run a court will so determine." Donald Lan
Jr., a partner of Mr. Mathis in the firm Strasburger &amp; Price,
adds: "It's a very big stretch to extend to estate taxes the
principles of income-tax law."
   Lawyers for the Meadors and the church say no overall
valuation has been placed on the collection. The recently
issued public version of the IRS's private ruling doesn't try
to set a value and doesn't name any of the parties to the
matter. But the facts described clearly relate to the
Quedlinburg-treasures affair, which was widely reported
starting in mid-1990.
   The treasures are being stored for safekeeping at the
Dallas Museum of Art, pending the final settlement of a
tentative agreement to restore them to the church. The Meador
heirs agreed a year ago to give up all of the objects in
return for a sum that hasn't been disclosed. Lawyers for the
family and the church won't discuss the dollar figure but say
it is less than the German foundation originally agreed to
pay for the single manuscript.
   Mr. Mathis says the final agreement has been delayed by
the difficulties of communication and of working within
different legal systems. He says the documentation ending the
church's civil suit against the heirs should be completed
amicably within two weeks, after which the financial terms
would be disclosed.
   Mr. Mathis and Mr. Lan say that they haven't discussed a
settlement with the IRS and that they are awaiting a formal
deficiency notice. At that point, the Meadors could appeal to
the U.S. Tax Court.
   The IRS could add claims for interest or for civil
penalties for such things as negligence or failure to file a
return. If it prevails, it could claim the heirs are liable
for the estate tax.
   The IRS won't discuss confidential matters about specific
taxpayers. But a spokesman for Texas state tax authorities
says: "Our file on the Meador case is open. We've been in
contact with federal authorities about it."

   The Rev. Friedemann Gosslau
said his heart soared when he heard that medieval artworks
belonging to his church are believed to be in a Texas bank.
   He has complete faith priceless objects that disappeared in 1945
at the end of World War II will be found and restored to his
500-member parish and Quedlinburg's 12th-century cathedral.
   ``We must defend the interests of the church. When the pieces
are here again, we will show them, but this time we'll need help
with security,'' Gosslau said with a smile.
   The treasures, among Germany's most famous artworks, are the
subjects of an international struggle. The Lutheran church in
Quedlinburg has filed suit in Texas to try to recover a collection
that includes a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or
10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal flask with
sides shaped like birds, and an ivory comb inlaid with precious
stones.
   It is believed the works were taken to Whitewright, Texas by the
late Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who served in
Quedlinburg in 1945.
   During the war, the objects were removed from the Romanesque
cathedral to a mine shaft to keep them safe from Allied bombing.
They disappeared in 1945.
   Gosslau came to Quedlinburg 25 years ago and learned about the
missing works by studying cathedral archives.
   ``I thought maybe we'd find traces and then convince the people
to give the pieces back peacefully. I dreamed of it, but I never
counted on it,'' Gosslau said in an interview in his home.
   The Lutheran minister said it was always thought the missing
pieces could have been taken by ordinary Germans during the chaotic
end of the Third Reich; by Nazi SS forces who seized the cathedral
at the start of the war; or by the American soldiers who occupied
the town.
   Then in May there was news that a private West German foundation
that searches for stolen artworks had recovered a 9th-century
illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels.
   ``We had no idea where it was. It's fantastic news and it's sure
it comes from the church because it is described in the
inventory,'' Gosslau said.
   A second illuminated manuscript also noted in church archives
was recovered in June. Full details of how those works were
recovered have not been made public and they have not been returned
to the church.
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered the First National Bank of
Whitewright to open its vault for inventory by the cathedral.
   ``We were proud of what we have, and about what we didn't have
anymore,'' Gosslau said. ``The cathedral treasure is small, but it
is exquisite.''
   He would like any pieces found in Texas to join the rest of the
treasure that is kept in glass cases in the cool stone vault
constructed in the Middle Ages to hold the priceless objects.
   The part of the collection still in Quedlinburg is a dazzling
display that includes a Syrian vase brought back by crusaders, a
4th-century translation of the Bible, and a 13th-century
gem-encrusted illimunated manuscript.
   In the Middle Ages, the vault guard was a nun trained to watch
over the works, which were used in services that the royal family
attended.
   Tourists taking the cathedral's guided tour are allowed to look
at the treasure vault, a small room with tiny windows at the top of
a staircase on the edge of the nave.
   During a tour this week, the guide did not mention the lost
treasures. Nor were they mentioned in the small guidebook to the
church on sale at the entrance.
   The town had no chance to seek recovery of the lost valuables
once it became part of East Germany in 1949. Contact was limited
until the country's former Communist leaders opened the country's
borders last year.
   ``We knew the crates were broken into and some things taken
away. But we didn't know where they went,'' said Walter Gold, the
city's cultural adviser.
   ``Because the world was divided, we had no contact with the West
so we couldn't do anything about it.''
   The remains of Heinrich I, Germany's first king, and his wife
Mathilde are buried inside the cathedral. Heinrich I died in 936.
   While the cathedral is still state property, Gosslau maintains
that according to old laws the treasure belongs to the parish and
should be returned to the vault.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (15): Start at 'The Gates of Hell' -
The city is blessed with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the

only in the afternoons

Where is the largest collection outside Scandinavia of the work of Edvard
Munch? And where is one of the finest private collections of European art?
Where is the only museum in Europe entirely devoted to native American
Indians? And where is the only museum showing the influence of coffee on
social and cultural life? Where did the Dada movement begin?
Where can one view a collection of 20th-century art, dominated by the works
of Augusto and Giovanni Giacometti and Giovanni's son, Alberto? Where is one
of the world's finest museums of Asian and African art? And which European
city threatens its graffiti artists with imprisonment?
The answer to all these question is, of course, Zurich. The city is blessed
with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the most enthusiastic
observer busy for a week or more.
The smaller contemporary art galleries tend to open only in the afternoons,
so it is a good idea to visit the main collections in the mornings.
Why not start your tour at 'The Gates of Hell' by Rodin outside the entrance
to the ultra-modern Kunsthaus in Heimplatz? Here, you can acquaint yourself
with the work of the leading Swiss 20th-century painter, Ferdinand Hodler.
There is also an excellent range of paintings, drawings and sculptures of
old masters and Zurich artists from the 15th century to the present. It is
here that one can see so much Edvard Munch and so much space devoted to the
Giacomettis.
The Kunsthaus is on the circuit for full-dress exhibitions of artists of
international repute and often has smaller studio presentations of
contemporary and local artists.
The Swiss National Museum (Schweizerische Landesmuseum) is a neo-Gothic
building which looks like an old castle complete with gate tower and wings
built around a central courtyard. It is across the street from the main
railway station and acquired notoriety in the late 1980s when drug addicts
converged in the adjacent Platzspitz park. The addicts have since been
shooed away and the park has been restored.
It displays artefacts of Swiss culture from the stone age to present,
including weapons, flags, uniforms, armour, toy armies, costumes, coins,
jewellery, seals, glass painting, religious painting and sculpture, whole
house interiors, watches, musical instruments and farm and industrial tools.
In short, one can discover a well-presented and informative illustrated
history of Switzerland.
The Rietberg Museum in Gablerstrasse is housed in the grounds of an
exquisite 19th-century neo-classical mansion, Villa Wesendonck, built for a
German merchant in imitation of the Roman Villa Albani. It long served as a
retreat for musicians and writers. Richard Wagner spent several years here,
and there is a monument to him.
After the City of Zurich acquired Baron Eduard Van der Heydt's famous Asian
and African collections in 1956, this villa became a public museum for
non-European art.
The Bellerive Museum, housed in another neo-classical villa in Hoschgasse,
is devoted to arts and crafts, including art nouveau textiles, tapestries
and modern furniture. Sadly, the display space is limited, but the care
which is taken in presenting the frequently changing displays make it well
worth a visit. In the summer the courtyard contains a sculpture exhibition.
Across the street from the Bellerive is the unique Heidi Weber Private
Museum. This was the last building built by Le Corbusier and is the only
modern example of 'total concept art', where architecture, sculpture, and
painting live in supposedly perfect harmony. It is open only from June to
October.
The Buhrle Collection (Stiftung Sammlung EG Buhrle), built on the fortune of
the great Zurich-based weapon makers, Oerlikon Buhrle, is small, but
contains some of the finest European paintings from several periods. The
impressionist and post-impressionist works are particularly dazzling. Here
one sees Manet's Swallows, Renoir's Little Irene and Cezanne's Boy in the
Red Waistcoat, among other masterpieces. The collection is open only on
Tuesday and Friday afternoons from 2pm to 5pm but alone is worth a trip to
Zurich.
If North American Indians are of special interest, the Indianermuseum in
Feldstrasse 89, with some 1,400 items in part of an old schoolhouse, is
worth a visit. On the same theme, try to find the Museum Leuengasse in
Leuengasse 10. This unusual exhibition space - it is an old nuclear bomb
shelter - is devoted exclusively to North and South American Indian and
Eskimo art and culture. It houses not only ancient works but also the
occasional contemporary artists on two levels proceeding ever deeper into
the earth.
In addition to these formal collections, the city's main churches are
repositories of wonderful works of art.
The 12th-century Fraumunster in Munsterhof is best known for the narrow
stained glass windows created by Marc Chagall in the chancel and south
transept and by Augusto Giacometti in the north transept. If you have time,
you can see the remains of the Romanesque cloisters on the south side of the
church, decorated with frescoes by Paul Bodmer representing the legend of
the foundation of the abbey as well as that of Grossmunster and the
Wasserkirch.
Across the Munsterbridge the Grossmunster cathedral, with the south tower
crowned by a colossal statue of Charlemagne, can be clearly seen. The
Grossmunster also dates from the Carolingian period, and it was here that
Huldrych Zwingli set off the Reformation in 1519.
The bronze doors of the north and south portals are by Edvard Munch and
inside are stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti. The crypt under the
choir is the best example of early Romanesque architecture in Switzerland,
and it contains the original statue of Charlemagne. The one on the south
tower is a copy.

   DALLAS -- A Texas family that inherited religious and art
treasures in 1980 formally agreed to drop its claim to the
treasures and allow them to be returned to the German
cathedral where they were housed before World War II.
   The settlement, signed by the last of 14 members of Joe
Tom Meador's family, ends an almost two-year-old dispute
between the family and the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg,
Germany. The works were taken from Quedlinburg in 1945, when
Mr. Meador was stationed there as a first lieutenant in the
U.S. Army artillery.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Meador brought the works, including medieval
manuscripts and reliquaries, to Whitewright, Texas, where
they remained until 1990, when some heirs agreed to sell an
illustrated manuscript to a German cultural foundation. The
church sued the family in federal court in Dallas later that
year. A tentative settlement of the suit was reached in
January 1991.
   Specific terms of the settlement weren't provided, but
both sides said the Meador family will receive less than the
$3 million that they were to receive for the illustrated
manuscript. The accord also calls for the art and religious
works to be exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art before
returning to Germany.
   The settlement didn't resolve a preliminary ruling by the
Internal Revenue Service that the trove should have been
listed as part of Mr. Meador's estate. "In the event that
ruling becomes final, we fully expect to challenge it in
court," said Randal Mathis, a lawyer for the Meador family.

<HEAD>Meador Confided in Friend About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier accused of smuggling medieval
treasures out of Germany near the end of World War II confided to a
longtime friend that he took the trove, a newspaper reported today.
   For years before his death in 1980, Joe T. Meador was torn over
whether to keep the artwork or return it, Owen Hunsaker, Meador's
college classmate in the 1930s, told The Dallas Morning News.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it,'' Hunsaker was quoted as saying.
   ``He struggled with that a lot,'' said Hunsaker, a 71-year-old
retired airline executive who lives in New York.
   Hunsaker said his friend told him he found the treasures in a
cave in 1945 in Quedlinburg, now in East Germany, and had simply
wrapped them in brown paper and used an Army post office to ship
them to his home in Whitewright, 60 miles north of Dallas.
   Hunsaker is the first person to explain how Meador allegedly
discovered the artwork and moved it. Reports about the case first
surfaced in The New York Times two weeks ago.
   The treasures included manuscripts, crucifixes and ancient
coins, which church officials said were gifts to the Quedlinburg
Cathedral from Germany's earliest kings.
   Lawyers for the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg contend that
Meador stole the treasures while serving as an Army lieutenant
among troops that occupied the area in April 1945.
   Meador left the cache to his brother and sister, Jack Meador and
Jane Meador Cook. They are disputing the church's claim of
ownership and trying to keep the items, which are worth millions.
   The Meador family is asking the church's permission to display
the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art or the Kimball Art Museum
in Fort Worth while the lawsuit over ownership is pending, the News
reported today.
   ``We have not as yet spoken with either museum,'' the family's
attorney, Randal Mathis, told the newspaper. ``We think that they
would be appropriate places for safekeeping.''
   Hunsaker was in the Pacific during World War II while his friend
fought in Germany. He said that during a visit to Whitewright in
1948, Meador showed him artwork that he said he had wrapped in
brown paper, marked as ``old books'' and deposited in a mailbox at
Army headquarters.
   He said Meador told him that he found the artwork in 1945 in a
cave filled with treasures of gold and silver, and filled his Army
jacket with ``as many treasures as he could hold'' before returning
to his headquarters.
   U.S. Army reports indicate the treasures were removed from a
mine shaft near Quedlinburg within three days after Allied troops
occupied the area in April 1945.
   Hunsaker, the News reported, said Meador did not tell him
whether anyone helped him remove the artwork or whether he returned
to the cave later to get more items.
   He said they sat for hours paging through a manuscript with an
elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels, and highlighted with
a silver figure of Jesus Christ with his hand risen in benediction.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Hunsaker said. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   Hunsaker said he frequently tried but failed to persuade Meador
to turn over the artwork to authorities.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' said Hunsaker. ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''
   Hunsaker said he last talked to Meador a few years before he
died.

   People who knew Joe T. Meador say they
can't believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in
medieval art from a German church while he was a soldier during
World War II.
   The possibility that Meador stashed the precious cache in a
Whitewright bank vault was the talk of this farm town Thursday,
when The New York Times quoted unidentified sources as saying he
was responsible for one of the century's biggest art thefts.
   ``I just don't believe he was that kind of a man,'' said
73-year-old Mary Bryant, who said she had visited Meador's home but
could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art.
   ``He didn't seem the type of guy to me that would do something
like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, who also lives in this town of
1,760 people about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The newspaper said Meador, in the final days of World War II,
took the objects from a church in Quedlinburg, an ancient castle
town in what is now East Germany. The Times based its report on
interviews with art experts, lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   Stolen was a small, silver display case inlaid with enamels and
precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a liturgical
ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock crystal flasks
and gold and silver crucifixes, and other treasures.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   Dietrich Kotzsche, a German authority in medieval decorative
art, said the Quedlinburg treasures, dating to the 9th and 10th
centuries, could be worth millions.
   The Times reported today that the church in Quedlinburg has
retained two lawyers to seek the return of the art.
   Meador died in 1980 at age 64. He co-owned a family hardware and
farm tool business and grew orchids in a greenhouse behind the
two-story Victorian home he shared with his mother, Mabel.
   ``He was the type of fellow that didn't mix with people much,''
said Odell Caraway, a member of American Legion Post 225 to which
Meador once belonged. ``As far as I know he's never been involved
in any kind of crooked stuff.''
   Willi A. Korte, a West German government official who
specializes in the repatriation of cultural property, and Thomas R.
Kline of the law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth of Washington and Dallas,
said they planned a trip to Dallas today to negotiate with Meador's
relatives, the Times said.
   Neither those lawyers nor John S. Torigian, an attorney for
Meador's brother, Jack, could be reached for comment Thursday by
The Associated Press.
   Meador was an officer in the 87th Armored Field Artillery, which
occupied Quedlinburg and guarded a mine shaft where the Times said
the treasures were kept. The items disappeared a few days after
U.S. troops took over the area in 1945, the newspaper said.
   Three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they had never
known their boss to show off any art works.
   The Times reported that a source it did not identify said the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan. Harrell Stowers,
the bank's executive vice president, would not confirm that
information Thursday when asked by The Associated Press.
   Jack Meador, his wife, Jean, and Meador's sister, Jane Meador
Cook, also would not comment Thursday.
   How the treasures got to Texas is a secret that may have died
with Meador.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement since the machine gun
deal,'' said Mayor Clarence Tillet Jr., who explained that a judge
once charged four machine guns in the town's name to avoid paying
sales tax.

   Art treasures allegedly pilfered by an American
soldier at the end of World War II have been given to a Dallas
museum while attorneys for his family and an East German church
haggle over ownership of the treasure.
   Attorneys for the church in Quedlinburg and for the heirs of
former Army Lt. Joe T. Meador, who allegedly took the centuries-old
objects, announced the agreement today at the Dallas Museum of Art.
   The museum agreed to provide a ``temporary, neutral safe
haven,'' said museum director Richard R. Brettell in a statement.
However, the pieces will not be displayed publicly until the
lawsuit brought by the church is settled.
   ``Claimants presently contemplate permitting the museum
subsequently to display the objects ... with terms for any display
to be negotiated later,'' the statement said.
   The objects to be brought to the museum include articles of
gold, silver, ivory and crystal dating from the 8th to 14th
centuries, the museum said.
   The agreement was reached today between law firms representing
both sides.
   The items have been in Whitewright, about 60 miles north of
Dallas, and Dallas since 1945, the museum said.
   The artworks have been stored recently in safety deposit boxes
in banks in those cities.
   The Lutheran church, Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde of Quedlinburg,
claims Meador, who lived in Whitewright, stole the trove while his
unit was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of
Mesquite, brother and sister of the deceased soldier, have been
negotiating a proposed move of the treasures to the Dallas museum.
   The ownership lawsuit is being heard by U.S. District Judge
Sidney Fitzwater of Dallas, who is expected to review the
agreement. Fitzwater on July 9 ordered the heirs and the church to
agree on a facility to store the items until the case is settled.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his siblings.

   An East German church is getting help
from West Germany to retrieve art treasures believed pilfered by an
American soldier at the close of World War II, a West German
official said Monday.
   East and West Germany also agreed to build an information
database aimed at the return of other art works that vanished when
the Third Reich fell.
   Litigation to retrieve the so-called Quedlinburg treasures from
bank vaults in Texas is already under way. The Foreign Ministry
said Monday that West Germany would pay the legal costs.
   Bonn's help in meeting the expense will be a major boost for the
Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg, which claims its treasures were
stolen at the end of World War II, said Klaus Maurice, director of
the West German Cultural Foundation of the States.
   ``Nobody knew until now who had to pay, but they will pay and
this is marvelous,'' Maurice said.
   The Quedlinburg treasures include two rare medieval manuscripts,
a jeweled, ivory-carved container for relics and several
rock-crystal and ivory objects. They were allegedly removed from a
mine shaft where they had been hidden in the final days of the war.
   Maurice said there was no doubt the art works in question were
authentic.
   The Quedlinburg treasures, among Germany's most famous art
works, were allegedly taken by a U.S. army officer stationed in
Quedlinburg, now East Germany, in 1945, and brought to his hometown
of Whitewright, Texas.
   The church is suing the sister and brother of the officer, the
late Joe T. Meador, to recover the treasures.
   Maurice said officials have no clear idea of how many other
works were allegedly looted from Germany's artitistic heritage in
the final months of the war.
   ``The problem up to now is that we had two states and it wasn't
easy to speak with East Germany,'' Maurice said. ``Now, this is
easier.''
   Maurice spoke after attending a two-hour meeting to dicuss
coordinated approaches toward retrieving lost German art. Also
attending the meeting was a Ministry of Culture representative from
East Germany, which is expected to formally unite with its Western
neighbor in December.
   The new database is to be established in Berlin and collect
information from museums, churches and other institutions
throughout the two Germanys, Maurice said. The database will
compare pre-World War II inventories with current records in an
attempt to get a complete picture of what is missing, he said.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Parisian cathedral of culture - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last
week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study
the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the
same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of
the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac;
and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship
between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at
Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres
as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all
over France.
I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to
mark the re-opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the
Palais de Chaillot. The story of this museum goes back to the 1880s when the
architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the
French public should have the chance to see, in Paris, the high points of
French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this
remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in
what was then the new Palais du Trocadero, which had originally been
designed by the architect Davioud for the Paris Universal Exhibition in
1878.
The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the
opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments.
Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity
consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments
including Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. He wrote a dictionary
of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his
conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the
parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century
engineering.
As the original progenitor of the museum, Viollet-le-Duc would have approved
of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original
Trocadero was transformed in 1937 by the architect Carlu into the Palais de
Chaillot, as the centrepiece of the Paris Universal Exposition of that year.
Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish
fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the Eiffel Tower. They remain
resolutely of the 1930s and provide an extraordinary contrast to the
architectural collections housed there.
For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics,
stranded in the 1930s splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic
energy of Mr Jack Lang and his ministry of education and culture to see the
potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of
work and inspiration from the young curator  - Mr Guy Cogeval, who came here
from the Louvre; in only six months he has achieved a considerable
transformation.
It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young
architect, Jean-Christophe Denise. This is a handsome light space in the
spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous
view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower (the furniture
is based on Carlu's original art deco designs); there is also a new
bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four
giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de
Carpeaux' - originally created by Paul Landowski in 1931. These look
dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths.
The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the Palais de
Chaillot, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The Musee du Cinema is
likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated Musee national des
Monuments Francais because of Mr Cogeval's great interest in film and his
plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic
arts.)
To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models
is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be
reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more
enjoyable. Mr Cogeval is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of
topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part
of the large programme of temporary exhibitions.
The first exhibition to be held is called 'Marseille a Paris', a version of
the very successful exhibition held in Marseilles. Its subject is the city
in the 19th century, considering both the physical character of the changing
city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of
artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans,
drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity
of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is
sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the
museum, but in 1994 there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.)
Marseilles grew and prospered in the 19th century, its artistic flowering as
aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to
show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively
unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters
and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense
exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African
trade and yet solidly rooted in the Second Empire in its architecture and
monuments.
The renewal of this museum in Paris is important for the broadening of our
architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the
solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun,
but I am sure Mr Cogeval will ensure that it continues with both scholarship
and excitement. It is a museum to watch.

<HEAD>Friend: World War II Officer Confided About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late World War II Army officer accused of
stealing priceless German art treasures at the end of the war
stumbled onto them during a battle and simply shipped them home in
a plain brown wrapper, a friend says.
   Owen Hunsaker, a college classmate of Joe T. Meador, said his
friend agonized over whether to return the stolen Medieval
artworks, but loved them too much to part with them, The Dallas
Morning News reported Friday.
   He said Meador was running for cover during fighting near
Quedlinburg, Germany when he ended up in a mine shaft and
discovered an ``Aladdin's Cave.''
   The Army lieutenant filled his jacket with ``as many treasures
as he could hold,'' Hunsaker said. He then mailed the artworks home
in a box wrapped in plain brown paper and marked ``old books.''
   Hunsaker, 71, of New York said Meador told him the story during
a visit in 1948. They had been college classmates in the 1930s and
kept in touch until a few years before Meador's death in 1980.
   The religious treasures stored in the mine shaft for safekeeping
from retreating Nazi forces disappeared in April 1945. They
belonged to Quedlinburg Cathedral.
   Lawyers for the Quedlinburg church contend Meador stole the
treasures and kept them in his hometown of Whitewright, Texas, a
tiny town about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church wants the treasures returned and has asked a federal
judge to prevent Meador's heirs from moving or disposing of the
artworks, believed to be stored in nearby bank vaults.
   Hunsaker's account is the first offering an explanation of how
Meador allegedly discovered and shipped the artworks that include a
bejeweled gold-covered manuscript, crucifixes and ancient coins.
   The artworks were gifts to the church from Germany's earliest
kings.
   During Hunsaker's 1948 visit to Whitewright, Meador took the
so-called illuminated manuscript ``wrapped in an old Texas quilt''
from a bedroom closet, he said.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said Hunsaker. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   He said it had an elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels,
highlighted with a silver figure of Christ with his hand risen in
blessing.
   Hunsaker said he frequently urged Meador to turn over the
artwork to authorities.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it. He struggled with that a lot,'' Hunsaker
said.
   Meador considered taking the artworks to Mexico to obtain phony
ownership papers, but abandoned the plan because he feared border
police, he said.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' Hunsaker said, ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''

<TEXT>
   Word that a local hardware and farm
tool vendor may have pulled off one of the century's biggest art
thefts while a soldier in Germany during World War II was the talk
of this town of 1,760 Thursday.
   There were more reporters than residents on the town's main
drag, about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   ``Not much happens here,'' said Carolyn Flaughter, ``You see
cameramen walking up and down the street. You just don't see that
every day.''
   According to a New York Times report Thursday, Joe T. Meador
transported the priceless pieces to Texas from Quedlinburg, an
ancient castle town in what is now East Germany.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan.
   Bank officials declined to comment on the reports. Harrell
Stowers, bank executive vice president, said he could not confirm
whether the treasures are or ever have been in the vault.
   Meador died in 1980. His brother, Jack, and his sister-in-law,
Jean, declined to comment Thursday.
   The Times based its report on interviews with art experts,
lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   The treasures include a small silver reliquary, inlaid with
enamels and precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a
liturgical ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock
crystal flasks and gold and silver crucifixes. Some of the
treasures were gifts from kings and emperors who ruled German
states in the 9th and 10th centuries.
   Meador was an officer with the 87th Armored Field Artillery, the
unit that occupied Quedlinburg and guarded the mine shaft where the
treasures reportedly were kept. They disappeared a few days after
American troops took over the area in 1945, the Times said.
   Three years after Meador died, his brother-in-law, Dr. Don H.
Cook, of Mesquite, Texas, sought to have two medieval manuscripts
evaluated, John Carroll Collins, a Dallas estate appraiser, told
the newspaper.
   A former employee of Meador's, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Meador reportedly showed his employees richly bound
gold and silver manuscripts.
   But three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they'd never
known their boss to show off any art works when they were around.
The three declined to give their names.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``Joe was a quiet man. I think Joe, in my way of thinking, was a
very, very intelligent man ... he seemed to mind his own
business,'' Mayor Clarence Tillett said.
   Tillett said he'd visited Meador in the house he shared with his
mother but didn't recall any unusual works of art.
   ``It wouldn't have surprised me for anything to come out of
Germany,'' Tillett said.
   Many residents recalled Meador as a loner whose most memorable
trait was his passion for growing orchids.
   ``He didn't seem like the type of guy to me who would do
something like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, a resident.

In the tiny Texas town of Whitewright, hard on the Oklahoma border, a scandal 
is brewing in which a man who raised prize orchids and ran a hardware store 
before his death 10 years ago may have been the perpetrator of one of the 
largest art thefts ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Joe T. Meador, by all accounts a quiet, unassuming man who served 
honorably in World War II and ended his service stationed in what is now East 
Germany in 1945. His unit was in charge of guarding a mine shaft that contained 
some of the world's most valuable art objects, hidden there at the time for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and a West German investigator are now 
looking to a bank vault in Meador's hometown of Whitewright, population 1,800, 
as the place where the treasures might at last be recovered. The investigation 
was disclosed Thursday by the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Texas to try to put some more nails in some coffins," said Willi 
Korte, the German investigator, in a telephone interview. "I have been to 
Whitewright before, and it wasn't because Triple-A recommended it." 
</P>
<P>
The first break in the case occurred last April, when, for a $3-million 
"finder's fee," one of the missing works was returned to a West German 
foundation, with the stipulation that the names of the sellers, as well as the 
name of the lawyer who negotiated the deal, would never be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the deal was cut for the artwork -- a 9th-Century jewel-encrusted, 
illustrated manuscript of the Four Gospels -- a spokesman for the foundation 
said the manuscript was taken to Texas by an American GI at the end of the war. 
That and other treasures were hidden in the mine shaft near Quedlinburg, a 
medieval castle town in Saxony-Anhault Province. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the manuscript was carried out in Switzerland, where such 
sales are protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy report in the New York Times pointed to Meador as the thief and his 
heirs as the people who arranged for the sale of the manuscript. Numerous calls 
to the relatives elicited a string of "no comments." The lawyer named as the 
intermediary in the transaction, John S. Torigian, left word that he would be 
taking depositions for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the bank where the remainder of the treasures are purportedly 
being kept would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Mike Satimauro of the Dallas office said the matter is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're intent on getting a better handle on what's supposed to be missing," he 
said. "We're trying to see if we do, in fact, have stolen articles and, if we 
do, we will do our best to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
While the FBI is investigating, the town of Whitewright went into an absolute 
swoon Thursday. Television crews in helicopters flashed overhead and the 
telephones never seemed to stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"This has thrown us into an uproar," said Mayor Clarence Tillett. "The whole 
town will be talking about this for some time to come. There's 1,800 people 
here and people usually know what's going on with everyone else in town. But I 
can tell you, all of us were surprised about this news about Joe Meador." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kennealy, the chief of police, said: "Nobody knows anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Korte, the investigator, said these kinds of thefts usually follow a similar 
pattern, in which art was taken, the thief dies and the heirs try to cash in on 
the treasure. In this case, the family members allegedly consulted with a 
number of experts about two manuscripts. Most of the experts told the family 
that the manuscripts probably were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a whole lot of sophistication, or they wouldn't have exposed 
themselves by having so many appraisals," Korte said. "I hope the family has 
some valuable information and some additional items." 
</P>
<P>
Korte said his first nibble came early this year, when word went out through 
the art world that one of the manuscripts could be had for the $3-million 
finder's fee. That was two years after the first word that the Quedlinburg 
treasures might be for sale, for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
"The offer clearly smelled like it was coming out of the U.S.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Korte was somewhat circumspect about how the field was narrowed to 
Whitewright, he said documents at the National Archives had been extremely 
beneficial. He said he had been looking for an officer to be the thief. Meador 
was a lieutenant when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
He said experience had shown that most such postwar thefts were "under the eyes 
of an American officer or with the participation of an American officer." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Meador, who had studied art in college, came back to Whitewright 
after his father became ill. By all accounts, he led a very normal life, 
waiting on people at the hardware store and raising orchids in the three 
greenhouses behind the family home. He never married. At graduation time, 
Meador provided free orchids to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Hasty, one of the pallbearers at Meador's funeral, said Thursday: "I 
heard from several people that Joe used to bring those manuscripts in the 
hardware store once in a while and left them laying right out there on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus in town is he didn't know the value of them. If he did, I don't 
think he would have laid them out on a counter in a hardware store downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this story.

   A federal judge has ordered an inventory of
medieval artwork believed stolen by a U.S. soldier from a German
mineshaft during World War II and stashed in a small-town bank
vault in Texas.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered Tuesday that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects, which have been valued in the millions
by German art experts.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the First National Bank in Whitewright and
the family of Joe T. Meador.
   Meador, a former Army lieutenant, is believed to have stolen the
objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright, about 60
miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II. Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the
objects in the bank for safekeeping, said branch President John
Farley.
   Farley said he never knew the art had been stolen and had been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership. ``We wanted to do
what was right,'' he said.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether charges can
be brought in the case because of statutes of limitations on thefts
of art.
   The judge on Tuesday dictated the circumstances of the inventory
down to the type of flash to be used in photographing the items,
the placement of the cameras and a requirement that all inspectors
wear cotton gloves.
   The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects were taken by Meador,
including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th
century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal flask and an ivory
comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Also listed as stolen are two manuscripts, one from about 1300
and the other from 1515, bound in precious metals and encrusted
with gems.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have refused to comment.
   Farley said the bank will ask to be dropped from the lawsuit
because First National never claimed to own the relics.

<TEXT>
   A 477-year-old manuscript taken from Germany by an
American soldier at the end of World War II has been returned to
its homeland.
   The law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth said Wednesday the Evangelister
manuscript, noted for its silver cover containing the figure of
Jesus Christ, was returned earlier this month and is being restored
in Munich.
   American soldier Joe T. Meador, who died in 1980, brought the
manuscript and several other items to America in 1945 from
Quedlinburg. They eventually wound up in the hands of First
National Bank of Whitewright.
   This is the second piece of Quedlinburg treasure recovered by
the German Cultural Foundation of the States. The Samuhel Gospels,
made in the 10th century, was recovered in Switzerland for a $3
million finder's fee, according to reports from the New York Times.
   The Lutheran Church is suing for the return of the other works,
which are being held in a Dallas museum.

<HEAD>Attorneys for German Church Say Family Is Hiding Treasures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for an East German church trying to
recover medieval treasures stolen during World War II allege that a
Texas family moved or hid some of the items in the last two weeks.
   In court documents, the attorneys accuse relatives of Joe T.
Meador of Whitewright of moving the articles from bank vaults in
Dallas and Whitewright so the lawyers wouldn't find them.
   Meador, who died in 1980, allegedly stole the items, including
centuries-old manuscripts of the Gospels, from the church in
Quedlinburg at the end of World War II.
   Motions filed in federal court Friday allege that Meador's
siblings, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, ``have been linked to
more than half'' of about 18 artworks taken from a mine-shaft
hiding place near Quedlinburg in 1945.
   The Meadors allegedly inherited the trove, valued in the
millions, when their brother died of cancer.
   Raymond A. Krell, a Houston attorney for the Meadors, did not
return phone calls Saturday from The Associated Press.
   Alan Harris, an attorney for the church, declined to comment on
the motions Saturday.
   No court action was taken Friday on the motions.
   The church filed a lawsuit Monday after three weeks of
negotiations with the family reached an impasse.
   The lawsuit, which also names the First National Bank of
Whitewright as a defendant, seeks unspecified damages. The bank has
held some of the artwork for at least the last three months, its
lawyer said.
   A U.S. State Department legal adviser said this week that the
lawsuit was filed after East German officials learned the treasures
were about to be moved to Switzerland, where secrecy laws would
make them impossible to trace or recover.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater granted a 10-day
temporary restraining order Monday barring movement of the trove,
pending a decision in the case. But he denied a plea by church
lawyers that the items be placed in court custody for safekeeping.
   On Tuesday, he ordered the church be allowed to examine,
photograph and inventory treasures being stored in vaults at the
Whitewright bank and the First Interstate Bank of Dallas.
   During an examination Thursday of Mrs. Cook's safe-deposit boxes
in Dallas, only one item believed to be a Quedlinburg treasure was
found, the church contends.
   Mrs. Cook removed several of the other items last week, the
church says, and an unidentified person rented a new safe-deposit
box and ``placed certain items'' into it. The objects were not
identified.

   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the small-town
bank that has been holding a cache of stolen medieval art to open
its vault for inventory by the East German cathedral that claims
the treasure.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater also ordered that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects.
   The art is believed to have been stolen from a German mine shaft
at the end of World War II by a U.S. soldier from Texas. German art
experts have said the treasures are worth millions of dollars, but
no specific estimate is available.
   The president of a First National Bank branch in the town of
Whitewright said he never knew the art had been stolen and has been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership.
   ``We wanted to do what was right,'' branch President John Farley
said in an interview published Tuesday in The Denison Herald.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from First National and the family of Joe T.
Meador, a former Army first lieutenant who is believed to have
stolen the objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright,
about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II.
   Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the objects in
the bank for safekeeping, Farley said. He oversees the Whitewright
branch but is based at Denison, about 70 miles north of Dallas.
   Farley told The Associated Press the bank will ask to be dropped
from the lawsuit because First National never claimed to own the
relics. He declined to answer further questions about the case.
   A church representative met with Farley on May 7 to demand
return of the treasures. The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects
were taken by Meador, including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary
from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask with sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with
precious stones.
   Farley and his attorney, Timothy Powers, told The Denison Herald
the bank had been negotiating with the church and the Meador family.
   The talks broke down last week when the story broke and
international attention focused on the bank and Whitewright,
population 1,760, Farley said.
   He said keeping the treasures did not affect the bank's daily
business or financial status.
   ``We're on the sidelines,'' he said. ``I'm sorry that we were
not able to get the parties to agree. It's not in anyone's best
interest to incur litigation costs.''
   Fitzwater revised his inventory order Tuesday after conference
calls with attorneys on both sides of the dispute.
   He also ruled on a defense request that had been informally made
Tuesday, but his office declined to reveal the nature of the
decision or the request until the request is formally filed with
the court Wednesday.
   Fitzwater dictated the circumstances of the inventory down to
the placement of cameras and a requirement that all inspectors wear
cotton gloves.
   Attorneys for the defendants did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have declined to comment.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether criminal
charges could be brought in the case because of statutes of
limitations on thefts of art and antiquities.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said criminal charges might be pursued under the
National Stolen Property Act. The law prohibits interstate or
international transport of stolen art or artifacts.
   The law might be extended to heirs if they knew the art was
stolen and transferred it across state lines, Maurer said.

<HEAD>East German Church Files Lawsuit in Artwork Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An East German church has filed a lawsuit
demanding the return of medieval artwork believed stolen by an
American officer in the final days of World War II.
   After hearing oral arguments by telephone Monday, U.S. District
Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater barred movement of the church treasures
without a court order.
   Fitzwater also ordered that representatives of the Lutheran
cathedral in Quedlinburg be allowed to inventory the cache. The
artwork is believed to be held in a bank in Whitewright, a town of
1,760 about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church hopes to recover 15 treasures that had been hidden in
a mineshaft during the war. The treasures disappeared in 1945,
shortly after American forces occupied the medieval castle town.
   Among the treasures, said Thomas R. Kline, the lawyer who filed
the lawsuit, are a rock crystal flask of Byzantine origin; a wooden
box decorated with silver, gold, ivory and precious stones, dating
from the 9th or 10th century and containing relics of Henry I; and
two manuscripts, one from about 1300 and the other from 1515, bound
in precious metals and encrusted with gems.
   Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who was among the U.S.
troops who entered Quedlinburg in April 1945, is believed to have
stolen the artifacts.
   After he died of cancer in 1980, his brother and sister, Jack
Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of Mesquite, obtained
the treasures and stored at least some in a vault at the First
National Bank, The Dallas Morning News said today.
   They apparently sold at least two of the pieces, the bejeweled
illuminated manuscripts, the newspaper said.
   A secretary for Jack Meador told The Associated Press on Monday
night that Meador had no comment on the lawsuit. Mrs. Cook also
declined to comment.
   An affidavit filed with the lawsuit said a church representative
had met with bank President John Farley to demand the treasures.
Farley confirmed that some of the artifacts are at his bank, The
New York Times reported today.
   Farley said he first saw the artworks in 1986 ``when a customer
of the bank brought me two manuscripts to have appraised.'' He
would not reveal the customer's name or disclose the number of
artworks stored in the bank.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said the lawsuit was filed primarily because
negotiations for return of the collection reached an impasse during
the weekend.
   An unidentified FBI agent was quoted by the Morning News as
saying it was unclear whether charges could be brought in the case.
   He said that the statute of limitations for interstate
transportation of stolen property is five years and that
international treaties governing theft of art and antiquities have
a 30-year statute of limitations.
   Maurer said charges might be pursued under the National Stolen
Property Act, a statute prohibiting interstate or international
transport of stolen art.
   ``The law would extend to heirs who knowingly transferred the
property across state lines,'' Maurer said. ``The fact that they
moved some of the artworks as recently as this year might make the
statute apply.''
   He said there is evidence the family knew for some time that the
art was stolen.

   The Army said it has thrown out all
records of its investigation into the World War II theft of German
medieval artworks that wound up in a small town in Texas.
   As a result, the Army may never know whether a former soldier
from Texas who died in 1980 was a suspect in the theft, an Army
spokeswoman told The Denison Herald in an interview published
Thursday.
   The artifacts, some of them stored in the vault of the First
National Bank in Whitewright, have been valued in the millions of
dollars by German art experts.
   A Lutheran church in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the bank and the late Joe T. Meador's
family.
   Meador is believed to have stolen the objects while an Army
lieutenant, and stashed them in his hometown about 60 miles north
of Dallas. He left the artifacts to a brother and sister.
   Army military police investigated the theft, but the file was
apparently destroyed in 1964 when records of all cases older than
15 years were purged, Barbara Parker, a spokeswoman at the U.S.
Army Crime Records Center in Fort Holabird, Md., told the Herald.
   Only records of historical interest survived the housecleaning,
Parker said.
   The Army abandoned the case in 1949 when Quedlinburg became part
of East Germany. Army spokesmen have said it is unclear whether the
military will reopen the case.
   The articles allegedly taken by Meador include a silver, ivory
and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century
Byzantine rock-crystal flask with sides formed like birds and an
ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Meador's heirs, Jack Meador, 70, and Jane Cook, 58, said earlier
this week that their unoccupied farmhouse was ransacked Monday
night by burglars who mistakenly believed the treasure was there.
   The burglary was described in a motion filed by Meador and Ms.
Cook seeking a protective order to keep all parties in the lawsuit
from discussing the case in public. U.S. District Judge Sidney A.
Fitzwater denied the motion Tuesday.
   The bank had acknowledged the artifacts are in the vault.
Fitzwater has ordered the bank to allow representatives of the
church to inventory and photograph the artifacts.
   Denison is 70 miles north of Dallas.

   An art expert says stolen German treasures stored
at Dallas Museum of Art rank among the world's rarest and most
important religious artifacts.
   One of the treasures may contain material linked to the Virgin
Mary, said Dietrich Koetzche of the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin.
   He visited Dallas to study the relics for a German church that
claims to own them. They were believed to have been taken from a
mine shaft at Quedlinburg, East Germany, near the end of World War
II by a soldier from Texas.
   The objects ``rank among the three most significant medieval
church treasures in Germany,'' he told the Dallas Times Herald. Joe
Meador, the soldier, died in 1980, leaving the art to his brother
and sister. It later was turned over to the museum.
   Officials say most of the treasures were reliquaries or
containers used to hold relics. Koetzche said he believes some
small reliquaries hold items belonging to the Virgin Mary, possibly
including a lock of her hair.

   Appealing to alienated Roman Catholics to
``Come Home'' to church, Franciscan friars in New York and New

   ``Too many alienated Catholics have heard only the voice of
authority,'' the Rev. Flavian Walsh says in an article about the
program in St. Anthony Messenger, a Cincinnati-based monthly.
   The ads, inviting telephone calls and participation in group
sessions, stress the gentler, compassionate side of the church.
Similar programs have also been used in Boston and Cincinnati.
   Of 15 million non-practicing Catholics in the country, 40
percent of them would like to mend fences and return to church
activity, according to a Gallup Poll, the article says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Art treasures plundered from conquered Nazi
Germany have been turning up from Moscow to Krakow to a tiny town
in Texas. Now, with the two Germanys ready to reunite, officials
hope to restore a cultural heritage that was torn asunder by war.
Part of that effort is to find the pilfered artwork and get it
back.

   In 1945, as the Red Army advanced on
Germany, a Soviet soldier stumbled across a stunning collection of
drawings and watercolors, by masters such as Rembrandt, Durer and
Van Dyck, stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering unit, bundled what
he could off to Moscow and stored the works in a museum. There they
sat for decades, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now, the aging soldier says the 364 pieces should go back to
their original owner, a German museum, the Kunsthalle in Bremen.
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has written to
his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, asking that the works
be returned.
   The Germanys, racing to reunite their politics and peoples, are
also trying to restore their cultural heritage, devastated by war
and its plunders.
   But the task is as monumental as some of the missing treasures.
   During World War II, German museums, libraries and churches
packed up their most valuable works and shipped them off for
safekeeping from Allied bombing raids. Later, many treasures were
again moved by the Nazis, to caves or salt mines, to hide them from
advancing troops.
   The destruction of war, the multiple moves, incomplete or
missing inventories, and plundering occupation troops all conspired
to conceal the fate of some of the treasures.
   Art historians say troops from both the West and the East moved
German artworks out of the country after the war.
   In addition, fires were often reported in art repositories. Some
historians question whether some of the fires actually occurred or
whether they destroyed everying that was claimed to have been lost.
   ``I fear that much of what was officially burned is still
somewhere,'' said one museum researcher who didn't want to be
identified by name.
   In addition to individual instances of plundering, many art
historians say some treasures were removed with official sanction
for use as cultural reparations.
   Although that policy was later rejected in the West and many
objects were returned, historians say it is not possible to tell
how much of what was taken was given back.
   ``The problem is that this was done by forces who were operating
like the intelligence forces, without documents or with documents
that were not declassified up to now,'' the museum official said.
``It was a problem of all four of the Allies.''
   ``For many years these things were considered lost anyway
because we had no information whatsoever,'' said a government
source in Bonn who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``You could say this is one of the last fields of really
finishing with the consequences of war.''
   In July, government and art representatives from West and East
Germany agreed to establish a Berlin-based databank to pool
information from museums, churches and libraries on missing art and
its last known location.
   Klaus Maurice, director of the West German Cultural Foundation
of the States, said the list could be completed in three years.
   ``We will make a list of what was lost, not what must be
found,'' he said. ``We don't want to give advice for police.''
   Improving East-West relations and recent finds have already
fueled hopes that more could follow.
   In a Texas court, an East German church, financed by West
Germany, is fighting the heirs of a U.S. soldier who the church
claims made off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
U.S. forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, 120 miles southwest of
Berlin, in 1945.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or 10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   An art investigator working with the Prussian Cultural Heritage
Foundation tracked the Quedlinburg treasures to Whitewright, Texas,
about 60 miles north of Dallas, last May.
   The foundation, which includes 15 museums in West Berlin, the
Prussian State Library and Prussian State Archives, houses the
collections of the former Prussian empire.
   Curators from its museums are working, with varying degrees of
success, to find and return their lost treasures, ranging from
Trojan gold to prehistoric baskets.
   The Bremen case is typical of what happened to Germany's art
during the war. The museum sent its masterpieces to several places
throughout the country for safekeeping in 1943, said director
Siegfried Salzmann.
   About 4,000 items went to a castle northwest of Berlin ``to
prevent damages by air attacks,'' he said. Soviet troops occupied
the area in April 1945.
   The Soviet soldier, Victor Baldin, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to Moscow, Salzmann said.

<HEAD>West Germany Buying Back Art that `Wandered' During Nazi Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quietly, unobtrusively and with limited
funds, West Germany has been buying back important artworks that
left the country during the Nazi era.
   Officials involved in the slow recovery of what Germans call
their ``wandered culture'' decline to say how much they've spent to
bring home some historically important works.
   But at least $29 million is known to have been spent over the
past five years in the effort the government has deliberately kept
on a low key.
   West Germany struggles with a particularly acute problem of
exiled art because of the volume of works sold during World War II
to help bankroll the Nazi war effort.
   Thousands of paintings, manuscripts, sculptures and other
cultural goods were salvaged from private collections or produced
abroad by Jews and intellectuals hounded from their homeland by
Adolf Hitler's regime. But only a fraction of the displaced art made
its way back to Germany after the war.
   ``We have no defined plan for buying up all the important
artworks that have wandered out of the country over the years, but
when the opportunity arises we make our best effort to get back what
has been lost,'' explained Hans Hieronymus, who heads the Interior
Ministry's office responsible for art acquisitions.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Hieronymus produced a
list of the major works repatriated over the past few months. They
included three 16th century paintings by Albrecht Durer, original
compositions of Richard Wagner and Robert Schumann, Franz Kafka's
1920 manuscript of ``The Trial'' and some personal letters, and a
1463 edition of ``The Apocalypse,'' one of the earliest products of
Johann Gutenberg's block-printing press.
   The most stunning indication of West Germany's commitment to
restoration of Germany's cultural heritage was the purchase five
years ago of The Gospel of Henry the Lionhearted, a handwritten,
552-page, 12th century volume that has commanded the highest price
to date for a book _ $18.8 million.
   A government art appraiser, Hartmut Vogel, says the Henry the
Lionhearted purchase was an inspiring success for West German art
circles as it rewarded an unprecedented effort of cooperation among
the sometimes fractious state and federal art dealers and private
cultural foundations.
   ``This was our masterpiece acquisition, but for the most part our
funds are too small to achieve much headway,'' Vogel told AP.
   He alluded to the purchase in mid-November of the Kafka
manuscript by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg as a bargain at $1.98
million. But that kind of surprise acquisition is unlikely to be
pulled off with any degree of frequency, he conceded.
   ``We have to be careful not to appear to be hunting dogs,'' said
Verena Tafel, one of five art historians busy collecting works for
West Berlin's Museum of German History, expected to open in the late
1990s.
   ``Every national museum tries to repatriate those artworks that
were lost during the Nazi regime,'' Ms. Tafel said. ``But being too
aggressive can have the result of driving the prices up.''
   An official with the Interior Ministry who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said recovery of famous German works from
abroad is an important facet of the government's acquisition policy,
``but we'd be stupid to publicly present this as a campaign.''
   He explained that a restrained profile in the international art
market is essential in outbidding hesitant competitors, and for West
German buyers to put out the word that they are embarked on a
repatriation project would serve only to price themselves out of the
market.
   Ms. Tafel noted, however, that museum collectors have to maintain
a delicate balance between discretion and enlisting popular support.
After learning of the West German government's plan to open a
historical museum in West Berlin, she said, the St. Louis Science
Center this fall returned free of charge an early German-made
scientific model of the human body that had been taken out of the
country during the Nazi period.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. government agreed to return about
6,200 paintings and drawings from the Nazi period that were
confiscated at the end of World War II. The propaganda artworks
commissioned by Hitler to depict model soldiers and citizens are
currently in storage at the Bavarian Army Museum in Ingolstadt
pending official decisions on how they should be presented.
   In cases where outright purchase is the only means of retrieving
expatriated artworks or items of special interest for German
museums, West German buyers concede they are fighting a losing
battle against wealthy Japanese collectors and British and American
curators with claims to significantly larger private funding sources.
   Sabine Fehlemann, director of the Von der Heydt Museum in
Wuppertal, traveled to London on Nov. 28 with authorization to bid
as high as $5.8 million for Pablo Picasso's ``The Acrobat and the
Young Harlequin.'' The bidding was opened at $8.6 million and closed
with the $38.6 million offer of Tokyo collector Akio Nishino.
   The 1905 masterpiece was a treasured possession of Wuppertal
until 1937, when Nazi forces confiscated the painting, declared it
``degenerate art'' and sold it to a Swiss collector for 80,000 Swiss
francs.
   ``I thought we had little chance,'' Ms. Fehlemann said after the
auction. ``But I wanted to see our Picasso just once more before it
disappears into a Japanese repository.''
   West German state collectors contend they enjoy fewer advantages
in the international art arena than their competitors because of the
dearth of private foundations to generate funds for public
acquisitions.
   The Interior Ministry's Hieronymus explained that public
offerings of important artworks often are advertised only a few
weeks or days prior to the auction, triggering a scramble for
donations from each of the 10 West German states, the federal
government and the public foundations. The cumbersome effort often
serves to stall presentation of a reasonable bid, he conceded.
   Increasingly priced out of the market for the best-known works,
the state collectors have concentrated instead on preventing the
further migration of German treasures.
   Under a 1955 law that charges the state with protecting national
culture, some 1,000 artworks in West Germany are designated by the
government as national valuables, restricting though not prohibiting
their sale or exchange abroad.
   ``We have to concentrate on preventing further losses,'' Ms.
Tafel said.
   ``In general, if a famous German work of art is on public display
in another country, that's enough to make us happy,'' she said.
``We're not like Melina Mercouri (the former actress who is Greece's
culture minster) _ we don't insist that everything must come back.''

<HEAD>Museum Expects Return of Art Treasures from Soviets Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West German museum said today it soon
expects to recover 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken
during World War II, including works by Duerer, Rubens and van Gogh.
   The works were taken to the Soviet Union after the war _ one of
numerous cases of treasures plundered or spirited away from the
defeated nation.
   Ursula Lichtlein, a spokeswoman for the Kunsthalle Bremen
museum, said officials there expect the 362 art works will be
returned next month or in October.
   She cautioned that ``negotiations are still under way'' with
Moscow, including questions of whether any payment will be involved.
   ``We have organized an exhibition for next year, so that we can
show the returned works to the public,'' Ms. Lichtlein said by
telephone from the northern port city of Bremen.
   The way the Bremen drawings and watercolors reached the Soviet
Union sounds almost like the plot from a suspense novel.
   In 1945, as the Red Army advanced on Germany, a Soviet soldier
stumbled across the stunning collection of drawings and watercolors
stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering corps, bundled what
he could off to Moscow, where he stored them in a museum. There
they sat, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now the aging soldier says the pieces should go back to the
Kunsthalle Bremen, their true owner.
   Kunsthalle Bremen director Siegfried Salzmann says about 4,000
items went to a castle northwest of Berlin ``to prevent damage by
air attacks.'' Soviet troops occupied the area in April 1945.
   The Soviet soldier, Viktor Baldin, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to Moscow, Salzmann said.
   Some of the museum's wartime treasures were returned after 1945,
but many others are still missing, Salzmann said.
   The soldier, now in his 70s, contacted the Bremen museum last
year and told them for the first time that some of what they had
given up for lost was secure in Moscow.
   ``We supposed they could be in the Soviet Union, but we didn't
know,'' Salzmann said in an earlier Associated Press interview. He
was on a business trip today and could not be reached for comment.
   The museum has invited Baldin to Bremen in September to help
write a reminiscence for the museum's catalog. Other artists'
represented included Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, van Dyck and Goya.
   Bremen's art treasures are stored for now in a museum in Moscow.
   During World War II, museums, libraries and churches packed up
their most valuable works and shipped them off for safekeeping,
often to the eastern reaches of Germany, away from Allied bombers.
   In a Texas court, an East German church financed by West Germany
is fighting the heirs of a U.S. soldier who the church claims made
off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
   U.S. forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, in what is now East
Germany, in 1945.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.

   Croatia's Art and Architecture Buried in Rubble

   Zagreb, Yugoslavia -- Smack in the middle of Europe,
divided by warring Byzantine and Frankish, Ottoman and
Austro-Hungarian claims to sovereignty, Yugoslavia's
Dalmatian coast has long been trod upon, plowed under and
fought over by a variety of civilizing influences with
dishonorable intentions: Saracens, Bulgaro-Macedonians,
Serbs, Venetians, Austro-Hungarians, Ottomans and Nazis. And
then there are the periodic earthquakes that shake up the
coastal towns, a matter of nature taking up where man-made
destruction leaves off.
   Through all of this, the medieval city of Dubrovnik -- an
almost perfectly preserved town that was once the seat of the
Republic of Ragusa -- has managed to remain intact. Until
now. More than 40% of the inner city has been destroyed in
the civil war between Serbs and Croats that began seven
months ago. The Serb-controlled federal navy showed up in
port in October and began shelling the 14th-century city
walls. In three months of fierce artillery and mortar
attacks, many of Dubrovnik's fine Gothic and Renaissance
structures have been reduced to rubble or burned down; what
remains has been scarred and pockmarked by federal forces
bent on teaching the secessionist Croats a lesson neither
they nor the rest of the world is likely to forget.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a civil war that has claimed so many lives and
displaced more than half a million people -- mostly Croats
fleeing the inexorable advance of the federal army -- concern
for carved stone and painted wood, however beautiful, may
seem fatuous. On the other hand, the sheer tonnage of
materiel dropped on Croatia, far more than the firepower
needed to secure key cities and land, belies the purely
aesthetic character of the damage. The wholesale destruction
of Croatian art and architecture has a sinister political
significance. Indeed, the Serb-backed forces seem bent on
destroying everything that bears witness to Croatia's potent
national identity.
   Hence the disproportionate number of historical, cultural
and religious buildings struck by shelling and bombing; the
more precious the site, the more vulnerable it is to attack.
The Ministry of Culture in Croatia claims that more than 500
monuments and historical buildings have been damaged or
destroyed in the fighting. Sacred buildings, notably Roman
Catholic churches, monasteries and cemeteries, are especially
popular targets: In just seven months of fighting, nearly 250
have been hit. The other repositories of Croatia's cultural
heritage are another army favorite; more than 370 museums,
libraries and archives have been damaged or destroyed.
   What's more, the monuments destroyed or under threat are
among the most beautiful in Europe; they represent a trove of
European art and architecture that stretches from antiquity
to the 18th century. A look at the places hardest hit by
federal troops makes it clear that they do not waste their
shells on insignificant buildings or plain little towns; in
November, Yugoslavian gunboats shelled the old coastal town
of Split, hitting the 11th-century St. Trinity Church, the
cathedral converted in the seventh century from Diocletian's
Mausoleum, and the newly excavated fourth-century Palace of
Diocletian. This palace, the largest and perhaps most perfect
example of late Roman palatial architecture extant, survived
the decline and fall of the Roman empire but has not
withstood the demise of the 20th-century Soviet empire built
in part on its foundations. A view of Split from the sea once
showed a gently aged jumble of Roman, medieval and
Renaissance buildings, their hard edges softened by centuries
of discreet decay; now the newly jagged skyline is decorated
by truncated spires and gaping holes in the city walls.
   The federal government's forces have also destroyed
several towns on the Serbo-Croatian front in the Yugoslav
interior. Vukovar, an ancient city on the Danube with many
buildings dating from the 16th-century Turkish occupation,
was substantially demolished in shelling during the early
months of the war. All that remains of one old quarter of the
town is half a church belfry and the Renaissance portico of
the narthex that stand precariously amid the
indistinguishable lumps of rubble that once made up the rest
of the church. In neighboring Ilok, a Yugoslavian patrol boat
on the Danube shelled the 15th-century St. John Capistran
Church and monastery; the roof has caved in and the
monastery's rich furnishings and considerable library have
been exposed by gaping holes in the walls.
   Such cities as Dubrovnik and Split are lucky in that they
retain much of their pre-war look and identity despite the
damage. But Karlovac is another matter altogether. The
16th-century Habsburg town built in the shape of a
six-pointed star has been hit by repeated waves of mortar and
shelling from the federal government's assault on this
strategic town. By mid-December, both Karlovac's industrial
sector and the old historical center had been razed by the
fighting, blurring the once-distinctive pattern created by
Hapsburg architects. More recently, however, the bombs came
so thick and fast (more than 500 mortars were fired on one
late December day) that no one knows how much or how little
remains.
   The Croat government in Zagreb takes its cultural heritage
seriously and has moved much of its portable art, including
paintings, icons and sculptures, and its sizable archives to
underground bunkers. But the army mortar often gets there
first, and much of the Renaissance and baroque art that
decorated the churches has been lost; what remains once the
smoke clears is carried off by looters. After Vukovar's old
Eltz castle was blitzed, its archives disappeared along with
its paintings and a valuable prehistoric collection excavated
from the neighboring settlement of Vucedol. A source in
Belgrade claims that the federal government has stockpiled a
huge collection of medieval and Renaissance art stolen from
Croatian churches. "We only hope," says a weary archivist
from the eastern town of Osijek, heavily battered by the Serb
forces that surround it on three sides, "that the Serbs
appreciate the value of all the loot they have carted off."
   It appears, to Croatians at least, as if the rest of the
world has been standing by while Croatia slowly drowns in its
own rubble. As is often the case, it has been left to a small
group of art historians, patrons and restorers under the
aegis of the Croatian Ministry of Culture, the
Kunsthistorisches museum in Vienna and Francesca
Thyssen-Bornemisza's ARCH foundation, an organization set up
to protect the cultural patrimony in Eastern Europe, to do
something. The group has set about compiling an inventory of
destroyed, lost or damaged property and is busy collecting
the material and equipment needed to restore the damaged
monuments and protect those that have been spared by the
federal pyrotechnics. Following a two-day conference held in
Zagreb in December, the group called on Unesco to sponsor a
fact-finding mission to assess the damage and to look into
the many artifacts carted off by looters and thought to be
stashed away in Belgrade. So far, the answer from Unesco has
been a resounding silence.
   A two-week-old ceasefire continued to hold yesterday as
the 12 members of the European Community, as well as a number
of non-EC countries such as Austria and Ukraine, recognized
Croatia and Slovenia. The United Nations sent 50 unarmed
peacekeepers to the area on Tuesday and promised as many as
10,000 if the truce is maintained. But fighting could begin
again any day. And unfortunately, no proposal drawn up by a
group of concerned art historians, however courageous, is
likely to prove equal to the Soviet-style arsenal still
available to the federal side. Until a definitive political
solution is reached, the destruction of both Croatia's and
the world's cultural heritage will continue -- not only in
the shelling of churches and archaeological sites but also in
the destruction of Croatia's vernacular culture, its wooden
farming villages and churches, less likely to be restored
than the grander historical monuments.

IT'S A FAKE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN EXHIBIT AT POMONA COLLEGE GIVES VIEWERS THE CHANCE TO SEE MORE THAN TWO 
DOZEN CLEVER COPIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pretend you are a wealthy art collector. Before you are two medieval 
manuscripts, both painted on vellum, both showing centuries of wear. 
Unfortunately, one is a fake. 
</P>
<P>
How will you discern which manuscript dates back to medieval times and which 
was painted by a notorious Spanish forger in the 19th Century? 
</P>
<P>
You might start by honing your connoisseurship at Pomona College's Montgomery 
Gallery, where "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger" is on display 
through Dec. 2. The exhibit, which is traveling across the country, was 
organized by curators at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
At this unusual show, viewers get a glimpse of more than two dozen fakes -- 
from 16th-Century Russian icons to the "Mona Lisa" to ancient busts of Roman 
youths. In some cases, the fakes are paired with genuine works in the same 
style. Viewers are invited to study them, read about the actual artist's style 
and background, then choose which piece they think is authentic. Sliding open a 
panel reveals whether the viewer has a future in art scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
As compelling as the "whodunit" tests are the cloak-and-dagger tales that 
accompany the forgeries, many of which have been exhibited as genuine for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Spanish forger" who faked the medieval manuscripts was a 
highly skilled and clever painter who went to great lengths to disguise his 
forgeries by using vellum that dated back to the Middle Ages, painting in the 
style of medieval illuminators and then "aging" his works. 
</P>
<P>
The forger, who art historians think was actually a Frenchman working in Paris 
during the Victorian era, went undetected in his own time. But 20th-Century art 
historians notice -- as Montgomery patrons may also -- that the forger was 
undone by his faces. To the contemporary eye, they smack of the cloying 
sweetness of the Victorian era and do not reflect the more somber, pious style 
of painters who worked in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Copying important works of art is a practice that dates back to ancient Egypt, 
says Montgomery Gallery Director Marjorie L. Harth, who points out that not all 
fakes and forgeries were initially meant to deceive. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, for instance, loved the classical Greek style and commissioned 
numerous copies of Greek art that were considered legitimate and highly 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists were illicitly copied during their own lifetimes. Painter and 
wood engraver Albrecht Durer went to court in the early 16th Century to halt 
reproductions. On the other hand, Rubens and Rembrandt encouraged their 
students and assistants to copy their work as a way to learn the master's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
And Jean Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875) occasionally signed his students' 
works to help them professionally in their careers, thus muddying the waters 
for generations of art historians to come. As a result, says Harth, practically 
all Corots -- especially landscapes such as the one represented in the Pomona 
show -- have come under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The public's fascination with art and forgeries may be heightened by the 
millions of dollars that masterpieces command today on world markets, Harth 
says. A Van Gogh self-portrait in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art was 
recently removed from display when its authenticity was questioned. Ditto the 
"Kouros," a classical Greek bust of a youth displayed by the J. Paul Getty 
Museum, which came under suspicion when a very similar sculpture known to be a 
fake appeared on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona show explains the high-tech tools today's art historian uses to 
detect fakes: X-rays, infrared photographs and pigment analysis. One work in 
the show, a supposed early 16th-Century "Venetian Renaissance" panel painting 
of St. George slaying the dragon, was revealed as a 19th-Century fake after the 
Walters Conservation Lab noticed some suspiciously heavy overpainting on the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
An X-ray revealed a late 16th-Century painting of the Last Supper underneath. 
Subsequent analysis showed that the scene of St. George and the dragon was 
painted over the earlier work in the 19th Century. The curators have removed 
several sections of the forgery to reveal the head of one of Christ's disciples 
and the small dog at Christ's feet, giving patrons a fascinating glimpse at a 
forgery exposed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to technical tools, historians use their knowledge to match 
artistic styles and flourishes with the appropriate cultures and epochs. 
</P>
<P>
Harth calls it "the complicated, interrelated workings of eye and brain." 
Perception, he says, is determined by context, "by the conditions, physical and 
intellectual, under which we see the work." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you know which one is authentic, it will look better than it did, and the 
one labeled fake will look worse," Harth promises. 
</P>
<P>
Fakes provide fascinating reference points for art historians. Like a slightly 
warped mirror, they reflect a skewed view of artistic reality -- but as with 
any illusion, they draw the viewer in. 
</P>
<P>
"Fakes speak eloquently of fallibility and of gullibility," Harth says. "Fakes 
. . . teach us to understand and to value authenticity in art." 
</P>
<P>
Forgers often are unable to transcend the barriers of their own time. A bust of 
a king from ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty is revealed as a fake by the 
playful, naive and human expression on the face. Walters curators say this is 
greatly at odds with the work of ancient Egyptian stone carvers, who depicted 
their kings as men of strength and power -- austere, remote and on a plane 
above mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, fakes give themselves away by sloppy inattention to detail. A 
"Gothic" ivory carving in the exhibit was revealed as a fake when scholars 
noticed that St. Catherine is seated in the center, with the apostles Peter and 
Paul to the sides. A true Gothic carver, pious and theologically schooled, 
would never have ranked a mere saint above the apostles. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-cultural faking is even more difficult than that which attempts to 
transcend epochs. A pink ceramic vessel, allegedly from 18th-Century China's 
Ching Dynasty, is revealed as a 19th-Century Western European imitation by its 
lack of subtlety and its inability to reproduce the two-dimensional composition 
of Asian art popular at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, forgers are artists in their own right and earn the grudging 
admiration of art historians for their clever, albeit misplaced, genius. 
</P>
<P>
Icilio Federico Joni (1866-1946) was a Sienese painter, restorer, art dealer 
and forger who specialized in Renaissance paintings. Joni, who often used 
panels that dated from the Renaissance to throw historians off the scent, was 
unmasked because he allowed too many paintings to trace their provenance, or 
ownership history, back to him. In addition, Joni gave all the characters in 
his paintings the same long, broad noses and elaborate halos. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Reinhold Vasters (1827-1909), the nearly perfect forger. A 
master goldsmith from Aachen, Germany, Vasters forged jewelry and decorative 
works in Renaissance style but was never exposed during his lifetime. The 
forgeries came to light in the early 1980s, when the working drawings for his 
fakes were discovered in the storerooms of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 
London. Perhaps, say the Walters curators, he left documentation to salve his 
ego and assure himself that his talent -- and his ability to fool the experts 
of his time -- would one day be known to all. 
</P>
<P>
Forgeries aren't always aesthetically inferior, either. Of the two Sevres 
clocks on display at the gallery, Harth says several curators would argue that 
the fake is actually superior. 
</P>
<P>
So what, then, is wrong with fakes? 
</P>
<P>
The Walters curators say: "A discredited work of art can only distort and 
obscure our view of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Harth adds that a forgery blemishes the reputation of the real artist and, 
perhaps more dangerously, creates a false basis of information about the artist 
and the period in question with which to judge future works. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) great, Harth says, "is not 
only that he painted beautiful pictures but that he painted certain pictures in 
a certain way at a certain time in the history and development of art. In 
addition to the craftsmanship, technique and cleverness of the painting, it 
shows genuine creative achievement."

STONE CASTLE OF CHILLON IMPRISONS DARK MEMORIES

Chillon! Thy prison is a holy place, 
</P>
<P>
 And thy sad floor an altar -- for 'twas trod, 
</P>
<P>
 Until his very steps have left a trace 
</P>
<P>
 Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod, 
</P>
<P>
 By Bonivard! ... 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lord Byron 
</P>
<P>
The rocky islet of Chillon, which Lord Byron helped make famous in the above 
sonnet and in his longer poem, "The Prisoner of Chillon," hugs the eastern end 
of Lake Leman (best known as Lake Geneva) a few kilometers from here. 
</P>
<P>
Byron created an unforgettable portrait of Francois Bonivard, who languished 
for four years in the Chillon castle dungeon. Even if not exactly true to the 
facts, the poem is a heart-rending statement of a man's devotion to his 
religious beliefs and a splendid introduction to one of Europe's most exemplary 
castles. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon, even without Byron's testimony, imposes itself upon one's 
consciousness. Three semicircular towers of the 13th Century dominate its 
exterior wall, while from the center of the fortress the castle keep rises 
above them. Edging in from the lake, the waters of the moat offer a tranquil 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The interior opens the darker aspects of castle life -- the dungeon, torture 
chamber, gibbet and arsenal, as well as its lighter side -- the banquet and 
receptions halls, bed chambers and chapel. 
</P>
<P>
These are aged spaces; they echo with stories of counts and dukes, of revelry 
and religiosity, of a spirit of long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon is a "restored" castle, to peg it correctly. The Bernese of Switzerland 
shored it up after a strong earthquake in 1584, but it was the archeologist 
Albert Naef, helped by detailed plans that showed the changes through the ages, 
who did the major work of restoration at the end of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon served many functions. At one time a fortress, a lookout, a princely 
residence, an administrative center, prison and arsenal, the building -- 
perforce -- always needed a bit of remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, judging from coins and other remains founded in excavations in 
1896, probably used the rock as an outpost. Later generations recognized the 
strategic position of this little islet: Between the lake and the mountains it 
stood above the narrow road that led south into Italy. It was an ideal spot for 
defense and to collect taxes on goods that passed that way. 
</P>
<P>
The castle keep, an old tower of refuge, probably was built in the 11th 
Century; on the land side -- the most vulnerable point of attack, the 
formidable towers, comprising a second exterior "curtain" wall, were added two 
centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that the House of Savoy held dominion over this part of 
Switzerland, and its counts made Chillon their ducal residence. The Bernese 
ended all that in 1536 when they captured the castle from their Catholic enemy 
and in the process freed its most famous prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls; 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand feet in depth below 
</P>
<P>
 Its mossy waters meet and flow; 
</P>
<P>
 Thus much the fathom-line was sent 
</P>
<P>
 From Chillon's snow-white battlement, 
</P>
<P>
 Which round about the wave enthralls: 
</P>
<P>
 A double dungeon wall and wave 
</P>
<P>
 Have made -- and like a living grave. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prior of St. Victor's, Francois Bonivard had been imprisoned by Duke 
Charles III of Savoy because he favored the Reformation and wanted to introduce 
it in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Byron, who visited Chillon in 1816, cast the situation in his poem, taking a 
bit of artistic license in the process. By then, Byron's celebrity 
notwithstanding, the castle had seen its better days; it was fast becoming a 
neglected anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
Years later the restoration changed all that, and today's visitor, with only a 
soupcon of imagination, can easily move back a few centuries in time. 
</P>
<P>
The old moat, having been cleared of detritus from the ages, still laps its 
water against grassy shore and stony wall. One crosses it via a covered bridge; 
it replaced the old drawbridge that must have succumbed to too many foot 
soldiers, too many closings and openings. 
</P>
<P>
Stately courtyards flanked by several levels of ceremonial halls and living 
quarters fill the upper floors, while down below, on the less penetrable lake 
side (surely the dankest part of the castle) the dungeon spreads its gloom. 
</P>
<P>
"There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,/ In Chillon's dungeon's deep and 
old," wrote the poet. But the vaulted ceiling and the columns of unembellished 
stone speak of a harmony, a quiet aesthetic, that belongs as much to a church 
as to a dungeon. 
</P>
<P>
From 1532 to 1536 Bonivard was here, chained to one of the pillars. The pillar 
still stands, close to the one where Byron, in the tradition of graffiti makers 
through the ages, carved his name. Now, 173 years later, the poet's name merits 
a glass-enclosed case, and like most graffiti, appears indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the dungeon, castle restorers found the ruin of what was the 
original chapel, a tiny structure hiding such fragments as a delicate shrine 
and a Carolingian altar stone. 
</P>
<P>
Up above, the rooms evoke the more princely side of medieval life: the Hall of 
the Chatelain (the high bailiff), with its handsome windows and pillars from 
the Savoy period; the Bernese chambers, with their decorative 16th-Century wall 
patterns of flowers and birds, and the Hall of Knights, once the grand 
reception hall for the Savoyards, and later the official room of the Bernese 
high bailiffs of Vevey, lords of the castle, who made Chillon their residence 
from 1536 to 1733. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernese coats of arms are set in the walls; the Bernese added a large 
fireplace and mullioned windows that overlook the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the halls serve as museums, wherein are displayed artifacts from the 
Middle Ages and early modern Europe: a musket from 1600, stone sculptures found 
in the moat and four large models that show the rock as it was, the first 
construction in the 9th Century -- after Chillon's strategic site became 
apparent, and the subsequent alterations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the oldest parts of the castle is the keep, a place where defenders of 
old could always, as a last resort, barricade themselves in its highest 
reaches. Builders over the centuries tried to make it all the more formidable, 
adding stories until it reached its present height of 86 feet. 
</P>
<P>
During the restoration its walls had to be reinforced. When they were opened, 
restorers found 50 large franc pieces minted during the 13th Century. One 
wonders whether they were deliberately put there for future generations to 
discover, or whether they were tucked away in some final act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
It is a relatively easy climb up the gnarled wooden steps that lead to the top 
level of the keep, and from there one commands a panoramic view of the castle 
with its courtyards and machicolated towers, the lake, and, hovering above it 
all, the mountains. These are the same mountains that Bonivard, climbing up to 
a small window, looked at with such longing: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw them -- and they were the same, 
</P>
<P>
 They were not changed like me in frame; 
</P>
<P>
 I saw their thousand years of snow 
</P>
<P>
 On high -- their wide long lake below, 
</P>
<P>
 And the blue Rhone in fullest flow; 
</P>
<P>
 Bonivard's story, preserved in Byron's stirring lines, no doubt represents 
only one among the many that might be whispered from the walls and battlements, 
from the rooms and courtyards of Chillon. For Byron, for today's visitor, the 
castle stands as a venerable and remarkably authentic testament to another age, 
another spirit.

The Castle of Chillon is at the eastern end of Lake Leman about 90 kilometers 
from Geneva. A train from Geneva Airport can get you to Chillon in less than an 
hour; the drive by car along the northern edge of the lake, via Lausanne, takes 
about an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Montreux, about two kilometers away, along with Vevey a little to the west, are 
the main resorts at this end of the lake. The cities offer an exciting night 
life -- casinos and discos as well as a full range of hotels in all price 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyatt Continental and the Hotel Excelsior are among the deluxe hotels. Just 
three minutes away from the castle is the Bonivard, a 19th-Century hotel 
recently refurbished. Many of the hotels offer packages: three days and two 
nights, starting at $75 U.S. per person. Weeklong packages also are available. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreux-Vevey area is the scene of several festivals: the Montreux 
International Jazz Festival in July and the Montreux-Vevey Classical Music 
Festival from late August until early October.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: City overflowing with art - Patricia Morison gets to
know Rubens and his compatriots better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas
of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then
Antwerp is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern
Europe.
This great maritime city on the Scheldt has its sombre side, its rotting
Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind
Victor Hugo's judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the
churches, sculpture adorning the houses, Rubens in the chapels . . . the
city is literally overflowing with art.'
In Hugo's day, Antwerp's dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course,
did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of
extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas.
Now there is Antwerp 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will
ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with
pleasures.
Perhaps the key fact of Antwerp's history is that as capital of the Spanish
Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start
at Onze Lieve Vrouwe, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It
has been under restoration for decades, but Antwerp 93 speeded the programme
up.
The entire interior is again visible, with Rubens's three wonderful
altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From May 26
to October 3, the cathedral has an exhibition, Antwerp Altarpieces, the type
of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for
churches from England to South America.
Any civilised visit to Antwerp must be partly about getting to know Rubens
better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the
running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day.
Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by
Rubens loaned from Copenhagen. Most were made by Willem Panneels, who was
put in charge of the studio between 1628 and 1630 while the master was in
England and Spain (May 15 to June 27).
So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that
you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the
sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox,
Rubens's friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to St
Jacobskerk. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of Steen is his
last masterpiece, The Madonna with Saints.
Jacob Jordaens at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 June 27) is the
flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the
artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in 1640, Jordaens immediately
put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career,
the Jordaens studio continued to be hugely successful even though its
master's talent declined as Rubens's never had. This should be the year and
the show to reevaluate Jordaens's achievement.
Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition
mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of
Antwerp's two first Golden Ages, in the 16th century and again in the early
17th century. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous
printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the
Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are
prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and
intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life.
Here, too, are portraits by Rubens, an intimate friend of the great
Balthasar Moretus. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the
scientific side of the humanist culture so important to Rubens and his
circle. Botany in the Southern Netherlands (13 March-June 13) comemmorates
the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, Dodoens, Clusius and
Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus
presses.
Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum Mayer van
den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable
19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den Bergh was a wealthy
connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was
always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic Virgin Mary.
Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In 1904, his mother built the
exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases
still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century
sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish
paintings. Few art-lovers realise that Breughel's chilling 'Dulle Griet' is
hidden away in the Mayer van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of
only seven of the artist's works remaining in Belgium.
Diamonds enter the festival in Diamond Jewellery from Antwerp's Golden Age
(April 23-September 26). At the city's distinguished Ethnographic Museum,
there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from Zaire (September
19-December 31). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but
summer will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the
Museum for Fine Arts, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
A marvellous guide-book for exploring Antwerp is Derek Blyth's Flemish
Cities Explored (Bodley Head, 1990). It would be nice if in Antwerp's great
year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein
recommended might indeed be accessible.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "Europe Is Expanding"] </F>
  [Text] The inclusion of three Scandinavian states and 
Austria is changing the political and intellectual-cultural 
prospects of the European Union [EU]. The imbalance toward the 
south is disappearing and, with the accession of the north and 
the east, the touch of Carolingian stuffiness is waning. Since 
countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the 
further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of 
cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is 
beginning to dominate. 
  The old-established members of the EC scene in Brussels have 
long predicted this development with regret, and they are not 
wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political 
"deepening" of the Union becomes a rhetorical postulate without 
any prospect for realization. At least the Scandinavians do not 
have any inclination toward integration in the form of a federal 
state. We are facing the end of the late romantic period. 
  With Finland, the Union gets 1,300 km of Russian border and 
the proximity of the Baltic states -- with all the flair and all 
the risk. In the case of Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the 
single market, that is, the real economic and trade policy 
advantage of the community, has the greatest attractiveness. 
However, particularly Finland and Sweden hope for an increase 
in security, at least in political support. With Austria, the 
German language section of the EU is growing. However, more 
important is its function as a bridge to Hungary, Slovenia, and 
Croatia. Here, too, the Union, which has so far been oriented 
toward West Europe, is going to receive a fruitful closeness to 
the East. 
  Until the date of accession at the upcoming turn of the 
year, 
several obstacles -- both in substance and in terms of 
referendums -- have to be overcome. These apply mainly to 
Norway and Austria. In both countries the result of the 
referendums is uncertain; in Finland and Sweden it is considered 
relatively certain. Germany has pushed the membership 
negotiations forward with great energy. As a result, It is 
natural and unavoidable that it has not gained just friends in 
the old European Community.

@  Art for America's Sake

   Unlike many Western nations that are rich in art, the U.S. has no laws limiting the export of cultural treasures. 
Italy, France and Great Britain all have laws to screen major works of art before export, and American buyers have often chafed at restrictions that delayed or undid their purchases. 
However, in anticipation of the May 31 sale of the Stillman Pontormo at Christie's, many Americans began to think for the first time that such restrictions might be a good idea here. 
Although privately owned, this great Italian mannerist portrait had been on loan to American museums for decades. 
The successful bid by the J. Paul Getty Museum brought a collective sigh of relief and blunted the edge of those worries: The painting will stay in America. 
But the problem will not go away. 

   Discussions are just beginning to get serious about whether American painting, sculpture, decorative arts and the art of native Americans should be kept at home. 
On June 20, at the convention of the American Association of Museums in New Orleans, the committee on museology unanimously passed a resolution drafted by Paul N. Perrot, director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, recommending that the museum community study the question and present recommendations to the relevant governmental authorities. 
Without restrictions on the export of cultural property, market forces play freely, not only for Rembrandts and van Goghs, but also for home-grown American art, artifacts and documents that speak to our history. 

   ---

   Although the U.S. has no strategy for keeping American heritage at home, our policy of helping other countries protect their cultural heritage is much stronger. 
In 1970, when archaeological plunder was endemic in the jungles of Central America as well as the mountains of Asia Minor and Etruria, Unesco adopted its "Convention on the Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property." 
More than 60 nations are now signatories, but the U.S. is the only one among them that could be described as an art importer. 
France, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are not parties to the convention. 
The U.S. Senate ratified the convention in 1972, but it was only in 1983 that Congress enacted enabling legislation, passing a bill that was a compromise between archaeological and commercial interests. 

   In accord with that law, the Cultural Property Implementation Act of 1983, the U.S. recently banned the importation of a type of Bolivian textile essential to religious and social ceremonies of the Aymara culture. 
The textiles in question are made from alpaca and vicuna wool in Coroma, a town high in the Bolivian Andes, and have been woven in the same manner since before the advent of the Inca or the Spaniard. 
The textiles have a silken luster, and enough had found their way to the U.S. for the Smithsonian to organize a traveling exhibition, "Aymara Weavings: Ceremonial Textiles of Colonial and 19th-Century Bolivia," in 1983. 
This in spite of export restrictions enacted by Bolivia in 1961. 

   Bolivia submitted a formal request to President Reagan to ban the import of these textiles, saying that the U.S. has been a major market for the weavings. 
Bolivia estimated that about half its sacred textiles had been smuggled out of Bolivia and found their way into American collections. 
The request was reviewed, following the provisions of the legislation, by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, a group of 11 archaeologists, dealers, private citizens and representatives of the museum community. 
The committee found that the loss created an emergency situation for the Aymara culture and recommended a five-year ban that went into effect on March 14, 1989. 
Customs is the agency charged with enforcing the ban. 
This is the second ban recommended by the committee; the first, in 1987, was to restrict the importation of pre-Hispanic material from El Salvador's Cara Sucia region.

   With the arrest in Miami of a former commissioner in the Buenos Aires police department, the stage was set for the recovery of old master paintings stolen in 1983 and 1987 from two museums in Rosario, Argentina. 
Juan Carlos Longo, 53 years old, and his common-law wife, Hilda Arias Longo, 40, were arrested after selling one of the stolen pictures, "Doves and Hens," attributed to Francisco Goya, to an undercover FBI agent. 
Special Agent James D. Keith of the Miami FBI called IFAR to confirm that this picture and others that Mr. Longo said were available were in fact stolen. 
After the sting and the arrests, the couple was extradited to Argentina, where Interpol continued the investigation and, in short order, arrested six other individuals and recovered a second work, "Portrait of Philip II," by Alonso Sanchez Coello, a Spanish 16th-century court painter.

   Rodin's "Mask of a Man With a Broken Nose" has been safely returned to the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, where it was stolen at gunpoint last November. 
An anonymous tip led the authorities to 24-year-old Stephen Shih, an unemployed truck driver, described by neighbors as "really nice," but also as "eccentric, peculiar and odd." 
Mr. Shih was charged with robbery, theft, receiving stolen goods, unlawful restraint and weapons offenses. 
If convicted, he faces a possible 40 years in prison. 
The police had to find the bronze without his help, however, and searches in and around the garage over which he lived were frustrating. 
Eventually, they found "Mask" well-wrapped and hidden in the basement of an apartment building owned by the accused's mother. 
Police and museum officials were jubilant at the happy ending, a rarity in art-theft annals, where the recovery rate hovers around 12%.

ART: LACMA'S 'TREASURES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM,' TAKEN FROM THE MUSEUM AT 
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, ILLUSTRATES THE MARCH OF ART THROUGH THE CENTURIES.

Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Delacroix, Degas -- given the list of 
stellar names from the pantheon in Western art history, it might seem odd to 
choose Francois-Xavier Fabre as the artist to represent the highly engaging 
exhibition, "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum: The Increase of Learning 
and other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre 
portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride 
of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show -- which opened 
Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to Sept. 9) -- surprisingly 
features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
The choice might be surprising, but it also turns out to be appropriate. The 
reason is that the Fitzwilliam, the first great university museum ever, has 
more on its mind than merely toting up celebrated names. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was established in 1816 by Richard, seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of 
Merrion, with a bequest to Cambridge University of his art collections and 
library, and a sum of money to care for both. (A sweet portrait of 19-year-old 
Richard, by the often eccentric Joseph Wright of Derby, hangs in the show.) The 
aim, according to the bequest, was to promote "the Increase of Learning and 
other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." The selection at LACMA, which 
numbers more than 160 items, suggests the diversity and scope of that intent. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest object is a delicate, incised drawing of a reindeer on a small, 
thin shard of limestone, dating from the Paleolithic period (about 12000 BC). 
The latest is also a drawing -- a 1918 pencil study of an actress wearing a 
large hat, by Amadeo Modigliani. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Asian, Middle Eastern and, mostly, European decorative arts, 
paintings, sculptures, coins, prints and many more drawings. Not everything is 
first-rate. The graceful Paleolithic reindeer may be regarded as among the 
finest examples of naturalistic art to have survived the ages, but the 
Modigliani is at best indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the celebrated names can't always be counted on to deliver celebrated 
works. Antoine Watteau's delicate chalk study of a man playing a flute falls 
apart in the crude rendering of the hands, while the Renoir painting of a 
street scene is, typically, a chromatic mess (the otherwise sensible catalogue 
wildly claims that it compares to "Luncheon of the Boating Party," far and away 
Renoir's finest painting). In the museum's historical chain, the 19th-Century 
holdings constitute the weakest link, forming a perfunctory coda to the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But individual excellence is not the only reason a museum -- especially a 
university museum -- assembles a collection. The Watteau drawing claims 
historical significance, serving as the model for figures in more than one 
painting by this important artist, while the Renoir is in part instructive 
simply because it dates from the same period as his great boating picture. As 
for the 19th-Century slump, it suggests the difficulty in making sense of 
contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, artistic events -- a difficulty 
common to any number of museums. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the gold far outweighs the dross in the galleries. The hard, jewel-like 
color of Bassano's early mannerist "Journey to Calvary" (circa 1540) gets my 
wholly arbitrary vote for Best of Show, while the furiously flailing limbs of 
Titian's monumental image of rape, "Tarquin and Lucretia" (1568-71), create a 
disturbing dramatic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Peter Paul Rubens' small oil on copper, "The Death of Hippolytus" 
(circa 1611), is as startlingly fresh as if it had been painted last week. 
Carlo Dolci's 17th-Century portrait of a contemplative scholar -- a fitting 
subject for a museum at Cambridge -- carries what is surely the most 
beautifully painted shirt collar ever: Like frosted glass, the translucent 
cloth creates a dazzling shadow play for the silver cloak tassel it conceals. 
</P>
<P>
The five medieval manuscripts and the many small bronzes -- especially an 
astonishing 2nd-Century BC figure of a drunken Hercules, which is believed to 
have been broken off the shoulder of a vessel -- are almost uniformly fine. And 
for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, here's a friendly warning: 
Avoid at all costs William Hogarth's delightful pair of paintings, "Before" and 
"After." They're raucously engaging images of a courtly lad and lass, but the 
bracketed event in question would doubtless make Jesse Helms apoplectic. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitively installed show is slightly marred by an annoying glare in the 
main gallery, which makes unobstructed viewing of the large Titian, Van Dyck, 
Guercino and Salvator Rosa difficult at best. (A makeshift space, carved from 
the well of the Ahmanson Building's atrium, the room has no ceiling to support 
adequate lighting.) Still, "Treasures of the Fitzwilliam" demonstrates 
something pivotal about the foundations of the modern era, something its 
"poster boy" makes plain. 
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier Fabre was a fashionable and successful painter of the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries. A student of the great neo-classical master, 
Jacques-Louis David, he won the requisite prize for any aspiring French artist 
-- the Premier Grand Prix de Rome -- and promptly left for Italy. He meant to 
insert himself as the inevitable destination for the on-going march of history 
and civilization: Imperial Rome to Renaissance Italy to the neo-classical turn 
of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Fabre's aristocratic portrait of a gentleman, "Allen Smith Seated Above the 
Arno, Contemplating Florence" (1797) is about as straightforward a declaration 
of this path of ascent as could be imagined. The actual identity of the sitter 
has long been in dispute (recent speculation is that he was American, not 
British), but clearly this tourist was a man of means. The picture's 
composition derives from a famous portrait of Goethe, with a notable 
difference: Smith's head, formally posed as a refined profile, is reminiscent 
of an ancient cameo. He is seated on a crude block of stone decorated with 
Egyptian hieroglyphs, a ruined Corinthian capital at his feet and the 
Renaissance city Florence spread out before his steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in period clothes and powdered wig, Smith is also wrapped in a tunic 
that approximates a Greek chiton or a Roman toga. The loping arches of a bridge 
that spans the Arno form a rhythmic procession leading gently to the graceful 
curve of the sitter's hand -- a sitter who has thus been deftly cast by Fabre 
as a living bridge to the classical past. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquired by the Fitzwilliam only in this century, the painting's 1797 
date is roughly coincident with the university museum's 1816 founding. The 
impulse that fueled one also fueled the other. It's easy to see the

THE TIMES SHOPPER: EUROPEAN ART FAIR IS FINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Plan ahead for the annual European Fine Art Fair -- the world's biggest 
exhibition and sale of antique paintings, prints, maps, furniture, objets 
d'art, jewelry, rugs and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will be held March 10-18 at the new Maastricht Exhibition and Congress 
Center. Maastricht, the oldest city in the Netherlands, with cobblestone 
streets and beautiful historic buildings, is in the province of Limburg, near 
the point at which the borders of the Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany 
intersect. 
</P>
<P>
The fair brings together more than 100 of the world's finest art and antique 
dealers from the Netherlands, Great Britain, United States, Austria, Belgium, 
France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This year's roster includes Richard Green (London, paintings), Eskanazi (Milan, 
carpets), Robert Hall (London, snuff bottles), Johnny Van Haeften (London, 
Dutch and Flemish Old Masters), Newhouse Galleries (New York City, paintings), 
Vanderven &amp; Vanderven (Netherlands, oriental porcelains) and Silber-Keller 
(Munich, silver, art nouveau, art deco). Participation is by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people are expected. They include curators from major museums 
plus private collectors, as well as lesser dealers and novices. 
</P>
<P>
Everything on exhibit is for sale. Prices are from several thousand dollars to 
several hundreds of thousands of dollars, but, regardless of the price, each 
piece must be considered "important" to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the exhibition is carefully scrutinized by a vetting committee. The 
committee not only verifies authenticity, but screens each piece to make sure 
it is rare and in good enough condition to be included at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Items that have been overly restored are not accepted. Nor are pieces of 
furniture that have been "married," i.e., the legs from a table with a damaged 
top have been removed and put on a different table top with damaged legs. 
</P>
<P>
The vetting committee's seal of approval is placed on every item, and copies 
are kept in the fair's office. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are fixed. Many of the tags on items are high, but they are based on 
genuine market value. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into the fair is like entering a museum. Only there is no glass 
encasement between you and the objets d'art. You can actually pick up an 
11th-Century Cambodian bronze statue of the Hindu God Vishnu or a Delftware 
platter made in the 17th Century and examine it at close range. 
</P>
<P>
No one will stop you from running your fingers over a 16th-Century, Flemish, 
wool-and-silk tapestry of an idyllic wooden landscape. You are invited to slip 
the brilliantly glittering diamond and ruby bracelet that once belonged to a 
French queen onto your wrist. You may sit down to rest on a late 16th-Century 
Chinese huang hua-li yokeback armchair. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these items have come from private collections and will go into private 
collections. The fair is the only time that they will be on public display. 
</P>
<P>
The vast interior of the exhibition hall will be transformed into a series of 
small galleries occupied by individual exhibitors. Some of the compartments are 
decorated like opulent rooms, others are more gallery-like. 
</P>
<P>
The diverse range of arts and antiquities will be presented in four sections, 
which makes viewing that much easier. 
</P>
<P>
The Pictura Section covers, from the Old Masters to Impressionists and early 
20th Century. The Contemporary Section includes post-1960 paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The Antiquaires Section offers European and Oriental furniture, bronzes, 
clocks, porcelain and glass, arms and armor, silver and jewelry, books and 
manuscripts. The Textura Section has textiles, carpets and tapestries, both 
European and Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue for the fair will be available only at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The piece de resistance at last year's fair was a beautiful Charles X French 
rosewood billiard table inlaid with citron wood, sold by Philippe Dufrasne of 
Brussels. Its price was only revealed to prospective buyers, and was not listed 
on the fair's registry of sales. 
</P>
<P>
There were also gem-encrusted reliquaries from the 13th Century, a set of five 
18th-Century Dutch glass paintings depicting members of the House of Orange, 
and a 17th-Century Flemish cabinet of ebony and stained fruitwood covered with 
paintings of landscapes. A set of stag's antlers (German)engraved with "The 
Wise and Foolish Virgins," dated 1563, was once in the William Randolph Hearst 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Items on last year's listing of sales included a Peter Paul Rubens (1557-1638) 
portrait of a bearded man, which sold for $850,000 to a Swedish collector. A 
Paulus Moreelse (1571-1638) painting of Pan playing his pipes sold for about 
$104,000, while a Salomon van Ruysdael (1628-1682) river landscape cost about 
$700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Peabody Museum purchased a 1717 Chinese export plaster figure of an 
unknown gentleman and a rare 18th-Century Chinese blanc de chine group of a 
foreigner riding on a liondog -- both for undisclosed sums. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of 18th-Century Arita porcelain vases and covers cost $14,980, but an 
exquisite Galle vase, dated 1900, decorated with a landscape in blue and yellow 
brought $3,088. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Louis Breguet's extraordinary traveling clock, made in 1817 and still 
ticking, was sold for $54,108. Two ornate golden bracelets set with pink topaz, 
emeralds and diamonds, made in England in 1835, cost $23,000, while a pair of 
fer de Berlin earrings, dated 1840, sold for about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary art that was purchased at the fair last year included an Andy 
Warhol portrait of Marlene Deitrich (1962, gouache and graphite on paper) for 
about $54,108, and "Beuys by Warhol," a silk screen and diamond point done in 
1960 for about $11,723. 
</P>
<P>
A 1972 untitled Willem de Kooning oil on newspaper, mounted on canvas, sold to 
a Swedish collector for about $67,635, and Sam Francis' "Triangle," dated 1975, 
was bought by a Belgian collector for $29,308. 
</P>
<P>
This year the fair will present a series of 12 lectures by specialists. 
Speakers include curators from Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, Boston's Museum of Fine 
Arts and Brussels' Royal Museum of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a program of concerts and recitals, including performances 
by the Moscow Ballet Ensemble, soprano Helen Lawrence and Amsterdam's Kamer 
Orkest. Maastricht's historic buildings are used as venues. 
</P>
<P>
The fair offers a gala first-night viewing and banquet. Tickets are about $50 
U.S., including the catalogue. Fair hours are Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m., Friday from noon to 9 p.m. Admission is about $14, including the 
catalogue.

FT  04 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: Mistaken identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now to get back to a subject I would have tackled in the past couple of
weeks except for other matters intervening. I shall not allow the week's
dreary round of comment on the British Budget to deflect me.
Last month, the 75th anniversary of almost everything was celebrated,
including the foundation of the Austrian republic. Never has this November
date seemed so relevant to current events, at least to the Austrian press.
The significance of the collapse of the empire was summarised in the
biggest-selling tabloid, Kurier. It noted that the monarchy's multi-racial
army occupied huge tracts of foreign soil by late-1918 and, 'in a typical
piece of Austrian nonsense,' surrendered in Padua to an Italian army it had
already beaten soundly.
We are still dealing with the consequences of the subsequent collapse:
Czechs and Slovaks pushed into a common state; millions of Hungarians left
as minorities and as potential problems for Romania, Serbia and Slovakia;
and Slovenes and Croats locked into a south Slav state where the Serbs
played the role of victor.
In Bosnia, there began a wave of persecution of those Moslems and Croats who
had been loyal to the monarchy. Austria lost South Tyrol and became 'the
state nobody wanted'; all the natives did want was union with Germany, so
the Nazis entered the country 20 years later under the pretext of
'expressing the true will of Austrians.'
Kurier concluded that the end of the empire was the 'beginning of an endless
tragedy of ethnic and national conflicts in central Europe.'
Die Presse adopted a complementary theme: in a modern Europe free of trade
restrictions, with open frontiers and possessed of a single currency, there
was only one historical precedent that mattered. The Habsburgs had provided
all this for a large part of the continent until 1918.
In the Salzburger Nachrichten, we read that the real anniversary was that of
1,000 years of Austria, which falls in 1996 - the year it plans to enter the
European Union. That, said a contributor to the paper, meant the country
would sacrifice a 'thousand million schillings' and 1,000 years of history
while receiving Ecus in exchange.
So, if Austria was at the centre of the storm which generated all the
European disasters of this century, it also provides the metaphor for a full
European union, for which it will sacrifice itself yet again.
The Dual Monarchy should indeed influence those in Brussels who are creating
a more boring Europe. The Austro-Hungarian model can add a dash of colour
and satisfy Euro-sceptics of different hues.
If Jacques Delors were to become, say, the Count of Brabant, he would appear
an even more attractive figure to the diverse populations of the Union. (The
title might carry with it the captaincy-general of the Belgian football
team).
Articles in Hello, and long-distance shots in the seedier London tabloids of
his wife on distant island beaches, would elevate this somewhat forbidding
figure to celebrity status.
He would be assisted by various new commissioners - the Duke of Connaught
would be the hereditary Commissioner for Peasants and Gentry, and the Duke
of Burgundy would make a fine food and drink supremo. A resurrected
Elector-Palatine would be president of the European Parliament, members of
which he would select personally.
By its very nature, the system would ensure the realisation of certain
socialist aspirations - a 'Europe of regions' would be an inevitable result.
Work sharing and jobs for life are at the core of the concept.
The post of head of state would pose some problems, though. Many would think
twice about a European emperor based in Vienna; but turning Otto von
Habsburg into a Carolingian figurehead enthroned in an already existing
European institutional capital, Strasbourg, would provide a decorative
addition to the scene. The Queen of England, as the first among equals of
European royalty, would supply the balance in the other half of a Dual
Monarchy.
And, finally, we should have a solution for the German problem. The
country's unification has not proved beneficial - it never has - so the
answer is to split it up again.
The old German Democratic Republic could re-emerge in slightly different
form as Prussia; Bavaria could gain what it always wanted - independence of
a sort; and Hamburg would concentrate on making money around the Baltic and
up and down the Elbe. Any number of daft and varied constitutions could be
provided to ensure that subsidiarity flourished.
To conclude with what might be an apocryphal tale, but one which has the
ring of truth: in 1920, a German weekly, presumably Simplicissimus, ran a
competition for the most startling headline of all time. The winner was:
'Archduke Franz Ferdinand Alive: Great War a Mistake.'
The time has come to rectify that mistake.

PRAYER BOOKS -- THE FIRST AFFORDABLE ART FOR THE 13TH-CENTURY MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the late Middle Ages, art in Europe was something that belonged to the 
rich and powerful. Royalty, high-ranking church officials and estate owners 
were the only ones who could afford to commission the spectacular paintings and 
reliefs now associated with that time. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime about the 13th Century, middle-class people in great numbers 
started to bring what is now considered high art into their homes. Only they 
didn't call them works of art; they were prayer books. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first affordable art," said Jennifer Haley, curator of the 
"Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibition that opened last week at the J. 
Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The exhibit of 20 prayer books handmade for home 
or monastery use will continue through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The books are spectacularly decorated with vividly colored designs and graphic 
illustrations of biblical or moral tales. 
</P>
<P>
"The books were made and bought for religious purposes," Haley said, "but they 
broadened people's lives in a lot of ways. You could even say that they were 
sort of status symbols." 
</P>
<P>
The earliest book in the exhibition is a 12th-Century monk's text, called a 
breviary, from the Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino, Italy. The 
calligraphy in the book, done by a scribe named Sigenulfus, is an artistic 
accomplishment in itself. But the chief artistic attraction of this volume that 
was a precursor to home prayer books is its fancifully decorated letters of the 
alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
As displayed at the museum, the book is opened to a frenzied, fanciful 
depiction of the letter C adorned with hordes of real and imagined animals and 
masses of interlaced vines. It is what a future generation would call 
psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of wild," said Thomas Kren, curator of manuscripts at the Getty 
Museum. "Unfortunately, we have no idea who the artist was. Most of the art in 
the books was not signed." 
</P>
<P>
The breviary, like most of the books in the exhibit, was part of a manuscript 
collection begun in the late 1950s by a German couple, Peter and Irene Ludwig. 
Their collection, which was bought by the Getty Museum in 1983, was assembled 
with the aid of a famed New York rare-bookseller, H.P. Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, Kraus wrote that finding the breviary was one of the 
crowning achievements of his career. He first saw it in 1962, when it was 
offered to him by a secretive Swiss book dealer, and he would have bought it on 
the spot had he not feared that the spectacular book had been recently stolen 
from its monastery home. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus traveled to the monastery in Monte Cassino to make inquiries. There, a 
kindly librarian told him what he prayed he would hear. The book, Kraus was 
told, had been missing from the monastery collection for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
"A pity, I said, but the tears welling up in my eyes were for joy," Kraus wrote 
in his book. "Had it been missing that long, it was no longer the monastery's 
property under law and nothing stood in the way of its sale. I could buy it 
without fear." 
</P>
<P>
Kraus, who died in 1988, bought the breviary for $30,000, a fraction of its 
real value. Kren declined to put an exact value on the book's worth today, but 
said that at auction it would be likely to fetch a seven-figure price. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest books in the exhibition that were made for home use are Psalters 
from the 13th Century. The illustrations in these books of Psalms were often in 
the form of a series of panels used to tell stories from the life of Christ or 
other biblical sagas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't love the idea of comparing them to comic books, but they do tell 
stories in somewhat the same way," Kren said. 
</P>
<P>
The books for the home market that really caught on, the Middle Ages gave way 
to the Renaissance, were known as Books of Hours. They served as guides to 
daily worship at prescribed times of day. "We found records that showed these 
books were very popular," said Haley, who worked as an intern earlier this year 
at the Getty Museum. She is now back in Princeton, N.J., where she is writing 
her doctoral thesis on 15th-Century manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
"They were especially popular with women who sought to emulate princesses and 
duchesses who were known to own several prayer books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
These Books of Hours were prohibitively expensive if done by known artists of 
the time. One example in the exhibition is a spectacular book illuminated by 
Flemish artist Simon Benning in about 1530. It was commissioned by Cardinal 
Albrecht of Brandenburg (who went down in religious history as the church 
figure Martin Luther rebelled against). 
</P>
<P>
Lower-priced Books of Hours, of which there are several in the exhibition, were 
still a bit on the expensive side for the average, middle-class citizen, but 
they were within grasp. "A book like this was a special purchase," Haley said. 
"It was the kind of thing, like a car, that you would not just go out and buy. 
It was a major investment, and you'd think about it a long time before buying." 
</P>
<P>
Although the books were used for religious devotions, their owners probably 
flirted at least a bit with the sin of pride. "They were not only objects of 
use, they were also something people liked to show off," Haley said. "It was 
kind of like people with high-priced books thinking of themselves as Cadillac 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
Johann Gutenberg and his printing press made hand-lettered and illustrated 
prayer books obsolete. Printed books were, of course, vastly less expensive and 
could be distributed far more widely. But they did lose their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"By the late 16th Century," said Kren, gesturing toward the books in the 
exhibition, "this art form was finished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The "Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibit will continue through Dec. 30 
at the J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu. Admission to 
the museum is free, but advance parking reservations are required. For 
information, call (213) 459-7611.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Iraqi Troops Plunder Kuwait Museum
   ----

<LP>
   While rampaging Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait City were looting
jewelry shops, shooting racehorses and making macabre dinners
out of rare zoo animals, some more disciplined troops from
Saddam Hussein's army made off with the treasures of the
Kuwait National Museum.
   "It is one of the most fabulous collections of Islamic art
in the world -- and it is all handpicked," said Esin Atil,
historian of Islamic Art at Washington, D.C.'s Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The museum that Ms. Atil remembers -- a cultural
storehouse of some 7,000 objects from countries as far-flung
as Spain and India, dating from the eighth century -- no
longer exists except as a shell. On Monday, a representative
for the Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington confirmed rumors of
looting that had been heard in U.S. museum circles. The
condition and whereabouts of the museum's manuscripts
(including one of the oldest surviving texts of the Koran),
medieval carvings, princely textiles and precious gemstones
are unknown.
   The most detailed report to date of the sacking has been
provided by a former researcher at the museum who escaped to
London this month.
   "I heard reports on the 26th of August that the soldiers
had gotten into the museum, and decided to go and check for
myself," said the researcher, who out of concern for family
members still in Kuwait asked that her name be withheld.
   Under disguise, she and a friend entered the museum and
were introduced to its "new director," a uniformed Iraqi
official from the Ministry of Information. On that visit, the
museum seemed intact. But on Sept. 4, she saw four large
Iraqi army trucks parked outside the museum.
   "This time I couldn't get in as close . . . but there
appeared to be people in civilian {dress} and uniforms," she
said. "Subsequently, I heard from others who had been there,
that they'd seen them {the soldiers} take out cases."
   Although grateful that the museum was not summarily laid
waste -- the fate of most Kuwaiti institutions -- the
researcher said she feared for the artifacts, many of which
are centuries-old and extremely fragile. Transport across the
desert in an army truck could damage ancient objects, and the
drastic change in climate could further affect sensitive
manuscripts, wood carvings and textiles.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi officials in Washington deny any
knowledge that this highly organized act of plunder took
place.
   "We don't have the slightest idea about that," said
Mahasin Yono, an Iraqi Embassy representative. "We don't have
any information regarding that matter." Nor, by her account,
does her government have any official position on protecting
Kuwaiti-owned art. If, as seems likely, the methodical
plunder of the Kuwait collection was planned from Baghdad, it
amounted to a direct insult to the legacy of the recently
deposed Kuwaiti royal family.
   The Kuwait National Museum was established in 1983 by two
members of the al-Sabah family, Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Sabah and his wife, Sheikha Hussa Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah.
Eager to create an Islamic cultural repository in their
country, the couple began collecting artifacts from all over
the world in 1975 and assembled a portion of them as a museum
with the help of Marilyn Jenkins, a curator of Islamic art at
New York's Metropolitan Museum. In 1985, the al-Sabahs
sponsored archaeological digs in Egypt.
   Sheikha Hussa is now in Switzerland. Her husband's
whereabouts are unknown. And all that remains for sure of
their magnificent museum collection is a small group of
objects now bound for exhibitions in the U.S.
   More than 100 pieces from the Kuwait National Museum were
on exhibition at the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad during the
time of the invasion. On Dec. 9, they will arrive in this
country for "Islamic Art and Patronage: Selections From
Kuwait," at Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery.
   Ms. Atil, who is curator for the show, little suspected
two years ago that the objects she would select for the show
might be all that would survive of the collection. Some of
the museum's greatest treasures were left off the list
because they were "too fragile or too important," she said,
clearly regretting her earlier scruples.
   "There was one very important 14th-century luster-painted
vase that had the name of the maker as well as the patron,
that had been broken and repaired," Ms. Atil said. "I felt we
should not handle this more than necessary. There were some
marvelous intact early Islamic glass vessels that I felt were
too dangerous to include . . . We took ones that were already
broken and repaired, because if anything happened they would
break in the old place."
   However, other rare objects did make it out of Kuwait for
Ms. Atil's show, among them a 10th-century astrolabe, a
10th-century marble column from a Spanish palace, late 16th-
and 17th-century Indian jewelry, and 16th- and 17th-century
Turkish rugs.
   Other treasures from the Kuwaiti museum owe their survival
to "Romance of the Taj Mahal," an exhibition at the Virginia
Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Nov. 25 (the show
then moves to New York's Asia Society). Although the
exhibition features just six objects from the Kuwait National
Museum, they include some of its finer examples of
17th-century Indian jewelry: a 530-carat emerald necklace, a
gold-inlaid dagger with a jewel-encrusted scabbard, and a
delicate cameo carved from onyx and rubies.
   The fate of these artifacts is as uncertain as that of
Kuwait itself. Ms. Atil's exhibition, which will tour the
U.S. through April 1992, may then head on to yet unscheduled
exhibitions in Europe. But the emeralds and other objects
from "Romance of the Taj Mahal" may have to stay put, thanks
to a White House executive order that has frozen Kuwaiti
assets in this country, along with those of its occupying
power, Iraq.
   "They will come back to us for safekeeping if the
executive order has not been lifted," said Pamela Jenkinson
of the Los Angeles County Museum, which organized the Taj
show.
   As for the bulk of the Kuwaiti collection, the refugee art
researcher in London is keeping her fingers crossed that
Saddam Hussein will turn out to be a good curator. "It has
taken us so long to get it together and get it to the Middle
East," she said. "It's sad, but we'll just have to hope."

THE RAPE OF EUROPA by Lynne H. Nicholas Macmillan Pounds 20, 498 pages
Art and war usually lie at the opposite ends of human experience, although
they meet sometimes in literature. But the fine arts presuppose peace: the
opportunity for the creation of painting and sculpture, and the repose
needed for their enjoyment, are fruits of tranquillity.
What, then, when art and war enter a different relationship, when
destructive, all-embracing modern war threatens to incinerate art galleries,
demolish cathedrals and museums, reduce statues to rubble, annihilate in
seconds the rich distillations of culture which have formed over centuries?
It is a 20th-century phenomenon that when great powers set upon each other,
everything is at risk, our lives and material treasures most of all.
One of the least known facets of the second world war is the fate suffered
by European art. In a book of brilliance Lynne Nicholas relates the period's
history from the novel perspective of what happened to Europe's material
culture under the Nazis. She tells the tale with absorbing narrative skill,
making an extraordinary achievement of scholarship read like a thriller.
Hitler and Goering were fanatical art collectors. Whereas the latter was
fairly catholic in his tastes, the former did not have tastes - he just knew
what he liked and disliked. He liked 19th-century German paintings, and he
disliked 'degenerate art', which meant Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism
 -and anything that looked distorted or 'unfinished'.
Another difference between Hitler and Goering was that whereas the latter
collected for himself, crowding his vast and vulgar palace, Carinhall, with
every sort of art, Hitler had imperial ambitions. He wished to turn his
Austrian hometown Linz into one of four great cultural centres of the Reich,
and the best art plundered from Jews and conquered neighbouring countries
was destined to hang there in a magnificent public art gallery he planned
for the city. By the end of the war the Linz gallery had accumulated 8,000
pictures, nearly twice the holding built up over a much longer period at
Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.
But the Linz plan was merely one corner of a vast displacement of art around
Europe during Hitler's 12 years, caused by many factors. The Nazis sold
'degenerate' art abroad to earn foreign currency. They looted art from Jews
and from occupied territories. The experience of the Prado collection during
Spain's Civil War persuaded curators everywhere in Europe, including
Britain, to make plans for safeguarding works of art against air attack; and
as soon as hostilities impended, tens of thousands of paintings, statues,
objets d'art, rare books and manuscripts were transported into the cellars
of castles beyond the Loire, quarries in Wales, and storerooms of
monasteries in remote corners of the Italian countryside.
With their usual thoroughness the German occupying administrations in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland and France - after some resistance, in this
last case, from the military government in occupied Paris - appropriated
vast stores of art. Guises of legitimacy were devised: any German art later
than 1500 AD was 'returned' to the Fatherland on the grounds that it had
been stolen in earlier wars. Jewish-owned art was simply confiscated. Public
art collections were 'safeguarded', an official euphemism for theft.
When the Allies invaded first Italy and then Normandy, they took with them a
desperately understaffed group of men detailed to protect the cultural
treasures that would be encountered in battle areas. This heroic group
managed much with their slender resources. Their greatest triumph, arguably,
was in preventing the US from appropriating works of art from Germany by way
of war reparations. A batch of 200 pictures was shipped from the American
zone in Germany to Washington where it might have formed part of a handsome
covering for the National Gallery's then under-occupied wall spaces. But
there was a vociferous protest from a group of courageous American
'Monuments' officers based in Germany, and in the resulting controversy the
US returned the works after they had been displayed to huge crowds at
galleries in various cities.
For this, and for their work in rescuing art at the close of the war, the
Allies' Monuments men turn out to be the heroes of Nicholas's tale. It is a
tale without an ending, because many works are still missing; and some great
achievements in material culture were destroyed, and can never be replaced.
And that, in the end, is the real danger in what happens when art and war
mix.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Art Crime Update:
   Easter Heist of Antiquities From Ancient Corinth

   Just before Easter, as people all over Greece headed to
their home villages or the seashore, jamming roadways, ports
and airports, thieves broke into the Archaeological Museum of
Ancient Corinth. Around 3 a.m., several persons attacked the
solitary 62-year-old night watchman and left him beaten,
bound and gagged. Before the day shift arrived to discover
the crime, the thieves had removed 271 objects -- many works
of Ancient Corinthian pottery; other ceramic works ranging
from the Geometric period to Attic black-figured and
red-figured vases, glass vases and sculpture, including a a
male Kourostype head from about 470 B.C.; and works dating
from Corinth's Roman period. Along with the antiquities, the
burglars took one million drachmas (about $6,100) in cash,
representing two weeks of staff wages and entrance fees from
foreign visitors.
   The thieves used a ladder purchased locally to reach the
museum's roof and descend into the courtyard. Having gathered
their loot, the gang tried without success to exit through
the heavy metal front door. They abandoned their tools,
climbed back up the ladder and then left it behind, covered
with fingerprints.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From his hospital bed, the guard said two of the men wore
hoods, that they spoke Greek and used walkie-talkies to
communicate with unseen accomplices. Authorities were
immediately notified, border guards alerted, and a huge
nationwide search for the perpetrators began.
   The theft is believed to be the largest ever of Greek
antiquities, and the Greek press suggests that plunderers of
archaeological sites recently have added museums to their hit
lists. Very few thefts from Greece are reported to Interpol
or to the International Foundation for Art Research, but
following the Corinth theft, Greek newspapers reported that
an alarming number of incidents, 231, occurred in the last
six months alone. The most important was a robbery in
November 1989 at the Archaeological Museum housed in the
Hospital of the Knights in Rhodes, where thieves also
disabled a night watchman and entered via the roof. Their
booty consisted largely of Mycenaean gold and jewelry.
   Although connoisseurs might dismiss many of the Corinth
items as of only mediocre artistic quality, the theft is a
terrible loss to archaeology. The excavations at Ancient
Corinth have operated continuously since 1896 under the aegis
of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The
school is the largest of the foreign archaeological
institutes in Greece, and since its founding in 1881 it has
been a home for students and faculty from 153 North American
colleges and universities who have used its libraries and
participated in its excavations. Excavations have unearthed a
Greek agora, a temple to Apollo, fountains and, from Roman
times, several small temples and a large amphitheater. The
American School built the museum in 1931 and enlarged it in
1958, but the collections and the museum and its contents are
the property of the Greek government.
   The Ministry of Culture, under its newly appointed head,
Tzannis Tzannetakis, issued a statement pledging to reinforce
museum security. As a rule, smaller museums in Greece have
few security guards during hours of opening and just one
watchman at night; electronic alarm systems are rare.
Skeptics have been quick to challenge the ministry to
activate those alarm systems that do exist to test which ones
would actually work and to see whether the police would
respond.
   The objects stolen at Corinth all were excavated and
studied, and many have been included in scholarly
publications, including the school's journal, Hesperia.
Should they be recovered, identification will not be a
problem since all the objects were photographed and properly
recorded, and each piece is marked indelibly to identify it.
   The city of Ancient Corinth, slightly inland from the
modern center, dates from Homeric times and became a maritime
power as early as the seventh century B.C. Early painted
pottery from Corinth was popular and has been found
throughout the Mediterranean. The city's artists also were
known for their bronzes, but most of them were melted down,
especially after Corinth was sacked in 146 B.C. by a Roman
army under Gen. Achaicus Lucius Mummius. Julius Caesar
restored the city about a century later.
   Corinth also was notorious as a city of pleasure, a sort
of ancient Las Vegas famed for its prostitutes and other
costly diversions. On the cliff above the ancient city,
archaeologists have excavated the remains of a temple to
Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Aristophanes is credited with
coining the verb "to Corinth," meaning to prostitute oneself.
Even in the 16th century, when Hans Holbein the Younger
painted a portrait of his mistress, Magdalena Offenburg, he
depicted her as a courtesan, "Lais of Corinth."

   "Sometimes things can get pretty cloak-and-dagger around here," Connie Lowenthal says. 
At the moment, things in the sunny pseudo-Tudor office where she and two other well-turned-out women sit seem about as sinister as a snoozing tabby. 
But appearances can be as deceptive as that fake Remington over the fireplace. 

   "I remember the phone call we got from two FBI agents on Staten Island," the titian-haired Ms. Lowenthal continues. 
"They said, 'We have a painting of a man on horseback with some naked ladies flying behind him -- is it stolen?'" 

   FBI? 
Stolen? 
Naked women? 
All in a day's work for Ms. Lowenthal and her associates. 
The trio may look like just a couple of ladies who lunch, but don't be duped. 
These babes are crime busters, warriors in the underpersoned battle against the billion-dollar-a-year rackets of art theft and fraud. 

   They fight under the banner of the International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR), a non-profit New York-based group. 
Their major weapon: A magazine. 

   The publication, IFARreports, hits the streets 10 times a year. 
Each glossy black-and-white issue pictures 100 to 200 of the stolen artworks reported to the group by law-enforcement agencies, insurance companies and theft victims around the world (the information also is recorded in IFAR's Art Theft Archive, which has logged 28,000 objects during its decade of operation). 
Sometimes the results can be dramatic. 

   Like the time a new subscriber opened his first issue to discover the marble head he'd just received from an overseas dealer was stolen. 
Thanks to IFAR, this portrait bust of Socrates was sent back home to Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli outside Rome. 

   On other occasions, life at IFAR really does turn cloak-and-daggerish. 
"Publication of stolen art sometimes does make objects too hot to handle and things do get returned through lockers at Grand Central and anonymous phone calls," observes Ms. Lowenthal, who became IFAR's executive director in 1985 after several years in the education department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

   The magazine's current issue describes how the 19th-century painter Edward Moran's "Squally Day at Newport" was recovered by a Washington gallery, in a parking lot, at night, in exchange for a lot of reward money. (About 12% of missing art eventually is retrieved, the same rate as for stolen boats.) 

   In another case, the magazine told how notes documenting a conversation between an IFAR staffer and a private eye helped lead to a Los Angeles pawnbroker's arrest for possession of a stolen Georges Roualt painting valued at a quarter-million dollars. 

   "It's really on-the-spot stuff; my husband says he's going to buy me a shoulder holster," jokes Margaret I. O'Brien, a London native who became editor of IFARreports in May after a career in advertising. 

   The third member of the IFAR triumvirate is 10-year veteran Virgilia Heimsath Pancoast, who runs the art authentication service. 
Within the past year the motherly Mrs. Pancoast, the office's dispenser of advice and Kleenex, married off a daughter and a son and also helped U.S. authorities probe the multimillion-dollar traffic in fake Dali prints. 

   This mild-mannered connoisseur provides IFARreports with some of its most lurid yarns of art thuggery and post-Holmesian detection. 
Mrs. Pancoast once aimed X-rays at a powerful painting of St. Paul attributed to the 17th-century French artist Philippe de Champaigne. 
Underneath the visible layer of paint was a completely different portrait of two figures -- in 18th-century dress. 

   IFARreports holds its 1,100 subscribers spellbound with tales of serendipity -- the man who discovered his stolen Cesare Detti odalisque listed in a Christie's sales catalog. 
And tales of woe -- the Bel Air chatelaine who one day took a good look at the picture hanging in a rarely used card room only to find that instead of her half-million-dollar impressionist oil the frame contained a high-quality photograph of the work. 

   Then there was the case of the devious dealer, a woman who exploited the art world's trust-and-a-handshake business practices. 
Until her fraud conviction, smooth-talking Claire Eatz worked an elaborate shell game. 
She'd take art from other dealers on consignment, sell it, and keep the proceeds. 
When pressed for payment Mrs. Eatz would get the pieces on consignment from the purchasers and return them to the original owners -- who no longer held title. 

   And let's not forget that painting of the gentleman and the naked ladies. 
After IFAR told the inquiring FBI agents the work was indeed hot, G-men working undercover on another case were able to retrieve it. 
The painting? 
Eugene Delacroix's "Tam O'Shanter Pursued by Witches." 

   Such major names as Delacroix surface only occasionally in IFARreports, especially in the annual issue containing the Interpol Most Wanted List (the current one includes paintings by Corot, Titian, Veronese and El Greco). 
Generally, however, thefts are skewed toward the most negotiable -- and portable -- pieces rather than the most valuable ones. 
"Anyone stealing a van Gogh is ridiculous," says editor O'Brien. 
"How ever can they expect to unload it?" 

   Judging from recent IFARreports, among the items the light-fingered particularly fancy are Oriental rugs, folk art and antique clocks, many conveniently equipped with handles. 
But thefts have lately included a second-century Roman general's sarcophagus, a 1476 Thomas Aquinas volume, and a group of antique mantels -- just about everything except the area in which IFAR director Lowenthal got her doctorate, 16th-century German sculpture ("there's not much traffic in it, licit or illicit"). 

   "With the thefts in one issue you could probably furnish a mansion," Ms. Lowenthal muses. 
"But between the Louis chairs and the prints and the ethnographic objects, it would be quite a tasteless assortment."

   Art Theft (and Sometimes Recovery): News From IFAR

   Although New York is America's leading art market, its
art-recovery law has not been a shining exemplar of Yankee
plain-spokenness. Indeed, New York has no statute expressly
for the recovery of stolen art, only an idiosyncratic muddle
of case law. Clarity, however, may be just around the corner.
The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, now has an
opportunity to define the law, in a ruling expected after
Labor Day.
   Just last year, a New York Supreme Court judge (the
state's lowest judicial level) rebuffed the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, saying it could not sue to recover a
Chagall gouache from Mrs. Jules Lubell because, since the
work's disappearance in the mid-1960s, the museum had taken
no action to report or recover it. But the Guggenheim is
back, having taken its case to the Appellate Division, whose
five judges decided unanimously in late January that the
museum's inaction should not prohibit it from bringing suit.
The Appellate Division's opinion said such cases should be
determined neither by statutes of limitations nor by tests of
due diligence, but rather by a court deciding whether both
parties had behaved reasonably at the time. Mrs. Lubell then
asked to have the Court of Appeals rule on the question, and
on March 29, despite the unanimity of the intermediate court,
it was decided that the highest court would do so.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Litigation to recover stolen art is not rare. Right now in
New York, the Republic of Turkey is waiting to hear if its
suit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, claiming
ownership of the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 works of ancient
silver, will be heard. The Netherlands is suing New York
developer and art collector Ian Woodner to get a Hans Baldung
Grien drawing it contends was in a collection stolen by the
Nazis.
   Earlier this year, Lebanon and Yugoslavia each asked a New
York court to freeze Sotheby's proposed sale of the Sevso
Treasure, a magnificent group of late Roman silver reportedly
purchased by the Marquess of Northampton in Switzerland in
the 1970s. The treasure is said to have an export license
from Lebanon, but Yugoslavia's papers assert that the
treasure was excavated in the early '70s near Pula in the
Yugoslavian province of Istria, where the Sevso family was
prominent, that its export was illegal, and that Yugoslavian
title to the silver is superior to any other.
   The New York Court of Appeals ruling will affect not only
the suits currently under consideration, but the behavior of
people in the art market. Every day, situations crop up in
which people require legal counsel, as they contemplate
acquiring works without provenance or decide whether or not
to return works of art requested by original owners.
   A Connecticut man came in to IFAR to inquire whether a
17th-century English clock he'd bought at an antique shop in
Valhalla, N.Y., had been stolen; we informed him that a
Manhattan dealer had reported the theft of one that appeared
to be identical in 1977. The clock now is worth upward of
$200,000, and attorneys for the two parties are negotiating.
   A private art dealer recently called IFAR's Art Theft
Archive to see if the beautiful Chagall oil painting he was
being offered was hot. He didn't know the sellers, and the
price was too low, he believed; "I'm not that lucky," he told
us. He wasn't. The painting had been stolen in Baltimore in
1970. Its current value is more than $1 million. Lawyers have
arranged the return.
   Civil suits are much more common than criminal actions in
cases of art theft. But April 30 is the trial date for
Madison Avenue art dealer Michael Weisbrod, who is accused of
buying two Chinese porcelains and an 18th-century pink coral
carving knowing they were stolen.
   The thieves had robbed museums in Detroit, Columbus, Ohio,
Albany, N.Y., Syracuse, N.Y., Boston and Baltimore of
decorative-arts items including a silver Tiffany pitcher; a
ceramic masterpiece of 1910, Adelaide Alsop Robineau's
"Scarab Vase"; the Chinese porcelains; and a group of English
antique pocket watches. They were caught after an attempt to
sell the watches. Mr. Weisbrod's attorney, Richard Berne,
told IFAR that he and his client are "confident that he will
be exonerated."

A NEW PAINTING -- AND A NEW PAINT JOB -- AT ART MUSEUM

The opening today of four newly painted and reinstalled galleries at the County 
Museum of Art makes all the artworks look like brand-new acquisitions, but one 
painting is the real thing. "St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the 
Father at La Storta," an Italian Baroque altarpiece by Domenichino, is a recent 
gift of the Ahmanson Foundation. The glowing devotional painting, depicting a 
saint at a spellbound moment, goes on view today in the museum's 17th-Century 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the museum does not disclose prices of new acquisitions, 
but the Domenichino is a rare and beautiful work that many institutions would 
like to have, according to Philip Conisbee, curator of European paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a great deal of eyebrow raising in the museum world" over 
LACMA's good fortune in landing the picture, museum director Earl A. Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though not well known and not in fashion, Domenichino's stock is rising. "He 
has been rediscovered in the last 20 years as part of a scholarly 
re-examination of Italian Baroque painting," Conisbee said. This particular 
canvas, which has been in private European collections and was purchased with 
Ahmanson funds from a London dealer, came to light in the early '80s -- just in 
time to be included in the appendix of Richard Spear's monograph on the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The richly colored altarpiece was commissioned for the Church of Gesu in Rome 
by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in about 1622, the year St. Ignatius Loyola was 
canonized. The painting hung in the church for awhile but was removed during 
Domenichino's lifetime and replaced with a copy made in his studio. Scholars 
believe that the original was privately sold, but records are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the Father at La Storta" 
portrays a priest on a journey in 1537 to Rome where he planned to seek papal 
approval of the new religious order of Jesuits. At La Storta, 10 miles 
northwest of Rome, the priest had a vision of the holy father and son in which 
Christ declared, "I shall be merciful to thee in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino has portrayed this episode in the priest's life as a moment of 
divine inspiration. The rapt priest, on his knees, looks up to the heavens 
where he sees God in human form, Christ holding and pointing to a cross (the 
symbol of the Jesuits) and angels. The congregation appears to float in a 
profusion of golden clouds that are composed of cherubic faces. 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino (1581-1641) was born Domenico Zampieri in Bologna. He was the 
favorite pupil of Annibale Carracci and a friend and rival of painter Guido 
Reni, two of whose works are owned by LACMA. They are currently in a traveling 
exhibition, but, upon their return, the museum will display them with the 
Domenichino and two earlier Ahmanson gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With 
the Smoking Flame" and Philippe de Champaigne's "St. Augustine." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino, who painted in a more classical style than Reni, is primarily 
known for frescoes on buildings in Rome and Naples. He did relatively few easel 
paintings. "There are maybe a dozen in the world," Conisbee said. "St. 
Ignatius" is a fine example because of its "classical perfection of form" and 
pristine condition. "Every brush mark is from Domenichino's hand," the curator 
said, noting that the painting had been properly cared for and not repainted by 
restorers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other refurbished galleries opening today display the museum's 
collections of 18th-Century art (including the recently acquired "Portrait of 
the Devin Family" by Louis-Michel van Loo), 19th-Century paintings and 
sculpture and works by the French Romantics.

MUSEUM PICKS FIRST CURATOR FOR INDIAN ART;

INDIAN PAINTINGS AT THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART.

<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art has appointed Ellen Smart its first curator of 
Indian paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, 45, will be in charge of about 1,400 Indian paintings and manuscript 
illuminations bequeathed to the museum in 1986 by Edwin Binney III, a former 
museum trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The Binney Collection, valued at $40 million to $50 million, spans more than 
seven centuries of Indian art from Rajasthan to Agra, from a rare, 12th-Century 
manuscript on palm leaves to 20th-Century paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take me a couple of years just to see what's here," said Smart, who 
begins at the museum in May. She will continue doing independent art research 
in Rhode Island until then. Her appointment was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smart first became acquainted with works in the Binney Collection when she saw 
them in a show in San Francisco in the late 1960s. At the time, she was 
studying for her master's degree at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with Indian paintings ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The works -- described by museum director Steven Brezzo as "a breathtaking 
addition to the (museum) collection" -- were held in probate until just last 
month, when complex negotiations between the museum, Binney's estate and the 
Massachusetts attorney general's office finally concluded. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of highlights from the collection is scheduled at the museum for 
next December. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, a specialist in 16th- and 17th-Century Mughal painting, received her 
Ph.D. in the art and archeology of South Asia from the University of London. 
She has worked as a research curator and a consultant for such institutions as 
the Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the Walters Art 
Gallery in Baltimore. In 1988, she was named a Fulbright Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Smart's publications range from children's books to articles in scholarly 
journals. According to Brezzo, it was important to find a curator "committed to 
public education" because Indian art has had so little exposure in San Diego.

   An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago. 
Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen. 
The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall. 
To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it. 
The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb &amp; Son representative. 
The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home.

   A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to Barbara Hammond, the museum's director. 
He sold them well below market value to raise cash "to pay off mounting credit-card debts," incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, Philip Russell, told IFAR. 
The curator, 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum. 
The theft was discovered early this year, soon after Ms. Hammond took her post. 

   Sentencing was postponed on Aug. 18, when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized for depression. 
His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three. 
But on Oct. 6, he had reason to celebrate. 
Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800. 
Instead, New York City police seized the stolen goods, and Mr. Krisher avoided jail. 
He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000. 

   ---Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side. 
Valued at $1.3 million, it was part of a four-crate shipment. 
The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing. 
Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be "lost." 
Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted." 

   Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree. 
Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from London. 
It was reported stolen in transit en route to Washington, D.C., in February. 
Months later, the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville, having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi.

   Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. 
About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures, were taken. 
The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery. 
As it turned out, Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family's home for a year. 
Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine. 
Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art.

   Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. 
The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988. 
According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years. 

   The precious canvas, cut from its frame at the time of the theft, was found in nearby Jena, hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves. 
No charges were brought against her.

   Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously. 
He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn. 
Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency. 
Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn. 

   The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake. 
They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and, with the help of the FBI, taped their conversation with him. 
After his arrest, the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Flanders comes to Cambridge - Patricia Morison enjoys
an illuminating collection of late medieval art at the Fitzwilliam museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON

<TEXT>
IT IS not tremendously likely, but imagine a day when conservators exercise
complete control over the shape of art exhibitions world wide. Imagine, too,
that the conservators then decreed that historic artifacts should lead
virtually risk-free lives at home.
No more grandiose government-sponsored shows of the like of last year's
Hispania-Austria, which procured hundreds of exceptionally precious
15th-century artifacts from museums in Europe and America, and freighted
them first to Toledo and then to Innsbruck. What kind of art exhibitions
might we then see?
An exhibition of 15th-century Flemish art which has just opened at the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge suggests what might be achieved if ever the
age of the jet-setting art-treasure ends. Splendours of Flanders; Late
Medieval Art in Cambridge Collections brings together some 70 exhibits -
panel-paintings, drawings, one well-preserved tapestry, sculpture, coins, an
iron-bound safe on wheels, printed books and illuminated manuscripts.
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of objects belongs to the Fitzwilliam's
own collection, where they can be seen (so long as you arrive on the right
day; the downstairs, with its medieval treasures in the Rothschild Gallery,
is closed in the afternoons.) A significant number of exhibits belong to
colleges and the University Library, and are not readily on view.
Not many Cantabrigians normally manage to inspect Sidney Sussex College's
iron-bound chest. It was brought back in 1607 from a synod in Flanders by a
Master who, like his 20th-century successors, seems to have been concerned
to step up college security. The massive chest had a complex locking
mechanism of three keys which required to be operated in sequence by the
junior bursar, the senior bursar, and the Master himself.
Queen's College has lent the exhibit which is the 'discovery' of the
exhibition; three panels showing scenes from the life of Christ, which would
have been the wings for a large altarpiece. Remarkably, it seems that the
panels may have been in England since before the Reformation.
The show's curators give this rare survival to the Master of the View of
Saint Gudule, a Brussels artist with a fondness for lively scenes and male
figures with features like pug-dogs. In Queen's chapel, the panels can be
viewed only from the front, whereas in the exhibition the saints on the
reverse are also visible.
Among the Fitzwilliam's own Flemish paintings, the most famous is Joos Van
Cleve's Virgin and Child, a lovely image of a baby who seems just that
instant to have fallen asleep on his mother's breast, to her huge
satisfaction. Another more modest Virgin and Child is thought to be by the
Joos's son, Cornelis Van Cleve. 'Daft Cleve' was one of the Flemish artists
who in the far less favourable conditions of the mid-16th century, decided
instead to try his luck in England where (for reasons unknown) he went mad.
Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of
Flanders'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are
several by the famous master, Simon Bening. One of his full-page
illuminations of The Annunciation shows in the margin a charming scene of
the Virgin apparently going for a stroll in the countryside, followed by an
angel, presumably carrying her workbox, not her lunchbox.
The Lord of Enghien we see in a full-page illumination in his personal Book
of Hours, kneeling before St Hubert, the patron of hunters. Someone else
paid handsomely for a Bruges manuscript with a fine set of the traditional
Labours of the Month, enlivening the calendar of feastdays and saints' days.
We can only see the book open at September, harvesting grapes, but
photographs of the other months also show scenes of sophisticated urban life
 -driving about in carriages and in May, courting one's mistress with a band
of minstrels.
What I particularly liked about this exhibition is its clear explanation of
the role of medieval religious books, particularly Books of Hours. These
were virtually mass-produced in towns like Bruges, Tournai, or Valenciennes.
Many were exported to England with the addition of English saints, such as
St Thomas Becket. In the Low Countries, ruled for a century by Burgundian
dukes with the keenest appreciation of fine books, it was an essential mark
of social status to own an attractive book of prayers.
The richer the client, the more miniatures and illuminated capitals he or
she could afford, not to mention 'personalised' books in which they and
their name-saints appeared. The skills of even a thoroughly dull painter did
not come cheap. In a fascinating and highly readable book published earlier
this year, Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work, (Yale; Pounds
35; 210pp.) Jonathan Alexander points out that in 1463, the celebrated
artist, Simon Marmion, earned enough from illustrating just one manuscript
to have the thatch on his house replaced with tiles.
By no means all the books are religious. The humanist outlook of the
Renaissance is represented by a group of manuscripts which do not come from
Cambridge. They are four superb illuminated manuscripts of classical texts
borrowed from the library established in the 18th century by Thomas Coke of
Holkham Hall in Norfolk. No doubt the famous agriculturalist particularly
enjoyed the page in the Virgil Collected Works which illustrates farmers'
tasks, everything from coppicing to luring a swarm of bees.
The fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is well worth having, not
least for an excellent historical introduction narrating how the Dukes of
Burgundy pieced together their great inheritance in the Low Countries, broke
with France, and created a Burgundian 'nation'. (A comparison between the
sexual appetites of Philip the Good and President Kennedy is
thought-provoking.)
Catalogue and exhibition are sponsored by the bank Gemeentekrediet (Credit
Communal) and the Flemish government, which has named the show Cultural
Ambassador for Flanders. Is this the first time that a foreign sponsor has
been willing to pay up for a show which will only be seen in a foreign
country? The Fitzwilliam made clear that the works of art were not going to
go to the Flemings. So the sponsor agreed that is the Flemings who must go
to Cambridge - after all, it is only a short hop to Stanstead. Is this,
then, to be the nature of arts sponsorship in the 21st century?

Saving the Cathedrals
---
By Nicholas Powell</HL>
<DD> 12/04/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Paris  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sweetly malicious smile on the face of the angel on the facade of Reims Cathedral is the second most famous artistic grin in France. 
It is second, of course, only to that on the Mona Lisa. 
But whereas Leonardo da Vinci's smug lady behind her protective glass panel is safe from everything bar nuclear war, the smile on the angel could one day be nothing more than a postcard souvenir. 
For the pollution gnawing away at Reims and the other 86 cathedrals of France has caused more damage over the past 100 years than the monuments suffered during seven centuries or so. 

   The French government, after decades of financial neglect, has voted extra funds to help restore cathedrals. 
But the current allocation of $16 million a year is grossly insufficient to counteract the effects of atmospheric pollution, the subsiding of earth under foundations, and even damage dating back to the two World Wars. 
Budget-gobbling projects such as the Orsay Museum, the Bastille Opera and renovating the Louvre -- which alone cost almost $1 billion -- put solving the problem of the sad state of France's cathedrals into a back seat for a number of years. 
Most French people are unaware of the plight of their Romanesque and Gothic masterpieces, which are visited, free of charge, by around 100 million visitors every year. 

   Some cathedrals fare better than others. 
Chartres, for example, built in the early 13th century, is in fine health, thanks to the unusually high quality of its stone. 
But Strasbourg, built between the 11th and 14th centuries in red sandstone, has suffered from modern pollution. 
Only a quarter of the sculptures on its western facade are original. 
The Last Judgment frieze was replaced in the 1840s and the statues of the Apostles were resculpted in 1910 and again in 1983. 
The weak foundations of the northern tower were reinforced with concrete early this century, which has had the side effect of putting strain on other parts of the structure that now need to be consolidated. 

   Yves Boiret, architect in charge of 13th-century Reims Cathedral, faces two major problems. 
The first is filling in small and dangerous cracks in the northern tower, which was damaged during a World War I bombardment. 
The building caught fire and the roofing melted, sending molten lead gushing through the mouths of medieval gargoyles. 
For years the north tower was left unrepaired as a testimony to the wartime bombing, meaning that damage was aggravated with each spell of frost. 

   A more delicate task at Reims is restoring the cathedral's magnificent sculptures, which are under constant attack from humidity, atmospheric pollution and high winds. 

   Since the 1950s, when the cathedral began receiving attention, badly damaged statues have been replaced with stone copies that stand out from the rest because there is no way of artificially aging them. 
To make matters worse, the stone of Reims Cathedral is almost impossible to find in local quarries. 
Mr. Boiret is considering molding copies of statues in resinous materials covered with powdered stone. 
That leaves the question of where to store the damaged originals and whether to replace 13th-century works that are intact but that risk being eroded. 

   The Sainte Croix Cathedral of Orleans was built between 1599 and the early 19th century on the site of a previous cathedral destroyed by Protestants during the 16th-century Wars of Religion. 
Aesthetically and architecturally speaking, it is more of a curiosity than a thing of beauty, a Gothic structure built during a neoclassical period with more decorative stone swirls per pinnacle than anything built during the Middle Ages. 
Unfortunately those extravagantly pseudo-Gothic architects were so keen on being medieval that they forgot the basic masonic wisdom of putting in plenty of gutters and gargoyles to cope with rainwater. 
The Orleans cathedral is thus a sort of intricate stone sieve, continually being eaten away by rain -- a peeling, crumbling wreck built in the same creamy-colored stone as the chateaux of the Loire Valley. 

   It is an anthology of restoration problems. 
The foundations are poor. 
The stone is crumbly. 
Architects put no roofs in the western towers, leaving rain and bird droppings, which corrode stone, free to ooze down to ground level. 
Many of the stained glass windows have simply dropped out. 
The 11 chapels around the high altar have been abandoned for years -- damp, musty and littered with fallen paint work. 
A copious crop of moss lichen and grass is eating into the stonework. 
Replacement stone is hard to find. 
The clergy uses only a small part of the building for services and local people understandably tend to go to parish churches. 
Hardly any tourists visit. 

   Jacques Moulin, Orleans's architect inchief, is replacing some of the lost 19th-century stained glass by copying the original patterns. 
He also is inviting modern artists to contribute designs. 
And he is replacing stonework in the 19 flying buttresses that need repair, at the tune of $1.4 million per buttress. 
Unlike Mr. Boiret at Reims, Mr. Moulin is unwilling to use resin molding, preferring to keep France's 50 specialist sculptors in work. 
He has an annual budget of $1.25 million and could do with three times as much. 

   Neither the state nor the clergy can or will put forward so much money. 
"The money is there; it is just the will that is lacking," says Mr. Moulin. 
"That will only return when the monument is once again at the heart of public life, as it was in the Middle Ages."

   Two thieves with a talent for disguise and a taste
for Rembrandt and Degas stole 11 paintings valued at upwards of
$100 million in a daring theft from the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum.
   But experts say the paintings are so priceless, in one sense
they're worthless. Any legitimate collector or dealer would
recognize them and wouldn't pay a penny, they say.
   ``People make pilgrimages to see these paintings. Scholars and
art lovers know where they belong,'' Constance Lowenthal, executive
director of the International Foundation for Art Research, said
Sunday.
   The theft occurred around 1 a.m. Sunday, when two men apparently
convinced museum guards they were police, then bound them with tape
and made their way to the museum's Dutch room.
   It was seven hours before a cleaning crew discovered the theft.
   The heist was ``a professional job,'' said FBI agent Paul
Cavanagh. ``This is one of those thefts where people actually spent
some time researching and took specific things.''
   He said the investigation would not be limited to the United
States.
   ``It is the biggest Old Master theft in this country, by far,''
said Ms. Lowenthal, whose organization tracks art thefts.
   ``The Gardner Museum is a treasure house,'' she said.
``Everything in it is exceedingly valuable and first-rate and
superb.''
   The value of the missing works, which included an ancient
Chinese beaker, was in the hundreds of millions of dollars, said
Karen Haas, the museum's curator. The police report gave the value
as at least $100 million.
   ``It's not overstating the case to say that these are priceless
works,'' said William Robinson, curator of drawings for Harvard
University's Fogg Art Museum. ``A loss of any of these works is
significant.''
   But their true value cannot be determined because they have not
been on the market for nearly a century.
   The works taken were:
   _ ``The Concert'' by Jan Vermeer.
   _ ``A Lady and A Gentleman in Black,'' ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' and a self-portrait by Rembrandt.
   _ ``Landscape with an Obelisk,'' by Govaert Flinck, another
17th-century Dutchman.
   _ ``Leaving the Paddock,'' ``Procession Outside Florence,''
``Three Mounted Jockeys,'' ``Program for an Artistic Soiree,'' and
another, less complete work by the same name, by Edgar Degas.
   _ ``At Tortoni's,'' by Edouard Manet.
   _ A Chinese bronze beaker from the Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100
B.C.
   The Rembrandt self-portrait and ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' the artist's only seascape, were especially important,
Robinson said.
   He said the theft of the Vermeer also was a major loss because
only about 35 of his works are known to exist.
   Experts said the motive for stealing such well-known pieces
could be ransom or acquisitiveness by a selfish, wealthy art lover.
   ``You hear legends of deranged collectors. But, mostly, I think
it's the stuff of spy novels,'' said Peter Sutton, curator of
European paintings at the nearby Museum of Fine Arts.
   Gardner Museum spokesman Corey Cronin refused to say whether the
works were insured.
   The Gardner Museum, which sits along the graceful green parkway
called the Fenway, has a state-of-the-art security system, and had
two security guards on duty at the time of the theft, Cronin said.
   He said no apparent damage was done to the museum, a four-story
building with a courtyard and a skylight.
   The museum was built to house the collection of the woman whose
name it bears, the widow of John Lowell Gardner, the wealthy son of
the last of Boston's East India merchants.
   Mrs. Gardner lived on the top floor of the mansion until her
death in 1924 at age 85. But she opened her home and its collection
to the public long before then, in 1903.
   The museum collection contains 290 paintings, 280 pieces of
sculpture and various religious objects, period furniture,
textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and
political figures.
   The last major reported theft involving a musuem occurred in
Paris on June 1, when a Georges Braque worth an estimated $3
million was taken from the National Museum of Modern Art at the
Pompidou Center.

   Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art
Gallery closed for a $6 million overhaul, Baltimore's Renaissance
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate
Henry Walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art
collections in the world.
   The renovation has created for Walters' precious jewels,
bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director Robert P.
Bergman calls a ``seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history.
   ``In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the
collection for the first time,'' Bergman said recently, pointing
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure
viewers. ``We direct people directly to the object through the
lighting.''
   The massive stone building with a marble-columned court
fashioned after the 17th-century Palazzo Balbi in Genoa, Italy, is
one of six comprehensive museums in the United States. Walters
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the
22,000-piece collection.
   The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and
poorly lighted rooms Bergman inherited when he left an art history
post at Harvard University and arrived here are gone. In their
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring
gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask;
polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden
for centuries.
   The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection
spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open
during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more
lie in storage.
   Walters, who made his fortune with the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad, left the collection _ along with a $3 million endowment _
to his native city ``for the benefit of the people.''
   The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving
14th-century Italian perspective paintings called ``View of an
Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school
of Cimabue, the first Raphael Madonna to come to America and one of
only 12 known paintings by Hugo Van Der Goes.
   Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and
light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights,
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces.
   Bergman jokingly calls the project a ``modest calling.''
   ``We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this
collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and
sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said.
   ``To do that was a special project. The building is a work of
art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark
structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as
ceaseless champion of his world-class museum.
   Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with $1 million
in city funds, $1 million in state funds and another $4 million in
contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the
money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches
original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble
columns for a consistent look.
   Going room to room, Bergman marvels at the miraculously
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for Marie
Antoinette; a collection of European porcelains considered second
only to the British royal collection at Windsor Castle; and some of
the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient
Egypt to art nouveau.
   The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a
French goldsmith's shop for Walters' delicate Faberge enamels, an
iris corsage ornament created by Tiffany and Co. and an ivory
orchid comb by Lalique.
   The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before Walters'
death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father,
who began the collection, had done.
   More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000
visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the
official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors
seasoned by a lifetime of trips.
   One after another, they stopped Bergman to thank him for
restoring the collection to splendor.
   ``Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right
thing,'' he said.
