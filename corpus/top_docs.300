<HEAD>New Drug Effective Against Rare Form of Leukemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single round of treatment with an experimental
new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of
leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well,
says a study published today.
   The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients
with hairy cell leukemia. In almost every case, the medicine erased
all signs of the disease.
   Hairy cell leukemia affects the white blood cells that make
disease-fighting antibodies. Doctors are also testing the drug
against chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
   The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, ``may well be the drug of choice
in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia.''
   The study was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro and published in
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In their study, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients. Of these,
11 have remained completely free of all signs of the disease for
periods up to four years.
   The doctors cautioned that longer follow-up will be necessary
before they can be sure they have actually cured the disease.
   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other
symptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,
this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.
   The Scripps Clinic reached an agreement recently with Johnson &amp;
Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to produce the drug, which is not
yet approved for routine use.

   An experimental cancer drug that works after a
single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine
yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.
   The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has
produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia
patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
   Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it
``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell
leukemia.''
   The drug also has been used successfully against chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of
the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.
   The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. Scripps recently
made an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to
produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as
far back as four years ago. In 11, the disease disappeared and they
remain disease free.
   In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost
complete success. However, they caution that longer follow up will
be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the
disease.
   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of

   A new cancer drug proved strikingly successful with very
few side effects in treating a relatively rare form of
leukemia, researchers said.
   The drug, called 2-CdA, was nearly 100% effective treating
12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. The patients underwent
just one seven-day treatment and experienced almost none of
the debilitating side effects such as vomiting, hair-loss and
kidney and liver problems associated with other chemotherapy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results need to be replicated by other researchers
before definitive conclusions can be made, and the long-term
effect of the treatment remains unknown. But the initial
experience with the compound is especially promising, and an
apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease,
scientists said.
   "There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one
course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay
away for as long as four years," says Lawrence Piro, chief of
cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La
Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed. "The leukemia
hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated." The
study is published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   "It is without doubt the most effective treatment for
hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response," adds
Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of
Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Dr. Estey
recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had
similar results with five patients. "It's a striking
finding," he says. "It's very unlikely to be a fluke."
   Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance
of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about
6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year. As the
disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to
infection and often need blood transfusions.
   Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and
patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since
then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called
deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from
hairy-cell leukemia. Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary
of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. of Switzerland.
   But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in
low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea,
vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders,
researchers say. "With the lack of toxicity and the ease with
which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's
something really going on here," says Ellin Berman, a staff
leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
New York.
   Scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary
of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and
distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical
trials. The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and
thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer
treatments.
   In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA, short for
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, was administered continuously for
seven days to patients aged 36 to 61. Within eight to 10
weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their
blood or bone marrow; the 12th had a small amount remaining
in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow
monitoring, Dr. Piro said. His blood tests are normal, Dr.
Piro added. None of the patients have had a relapse; complete
remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment,
according to the study.
   "When you can make all the disease go away with a single
infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to
be cured," Dr. Piro said. But because hairy-cell leukemia
proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after
treatment. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether
2-CdA actually cures the disease.
   The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by
Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined
immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the
Texas boy that lived in a bubble. People with that disease
lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical
that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting
white blood cells and kills them. Since cancer patients have
the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that
mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be
processed. The compound then kills the white blood cells,
including those that are cancerous. New, normal white cells
are then generated in the bone marrow.
   Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study
"is considered a pretty good series," says Sloan-Kettering's
Dr. Berman. "It's ironic that we have three active drugs for
a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common
forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments."
   Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in
initial trials to treat more common cancers, including
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. About 50% to 60% of patients --
most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the
drug, some with complete remission, he said. "Now, we will
use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and
remission are higher," he said. Meanwhile, researchers at
University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA
on AIDS-related lymphoma.

   Cigarette smoking appears to increase the
risk of developing leukemia, and kicking the habit may not be
enough to dodge the dreaded blood disease, a study says.
   Paul K. Mills, a professor at Loma Linda University and the
principal author of the study, said research suggests that even
former smokers are at high risk.
   ``It's very discouraging,'' Mills said Monday. ``We saw a strong
association between prior cigarette smoking and the risk of
developing leukemia.''
   The study's results are being published this month in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
   Cigarette smoking also has been linked to cancers of the lung,
bladder, pancreas, esophagus, throat and cervix.
   The study is part of the Adventist Health Study, a major
epidemiological investigation of the causes of various cancers
among California members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. About
34,000 Adventists responded to the study.
   Although the vast majority of Adventists do not smoke by church
proscription, many are adult converts to the religion who smoked
cigarettes prior to their baptism into the church.
   The researchers found that the ex-smokers had twice the risk of
developing leukemia than non-smokers.
   For people who regularly smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day,
the risk of developing leukemia increased threefold. The Adventists
who had smoked for more than 15 years had a 2{-fold increased
leukemia risk.
   Leukemia is a bone marrow cancer in which the marrow is replaced
by immature, abnormal white blood cells. The disease kills 18,000
people a year in the United States.
   Dr. Clark Heath Jr. of the American Cancer Society said the
causes of leukemia are largely unknown.
   But several studies in recent years, including a large study of
U.S. military veterans, have suggested smoking as a cause, he said.
   The Loma Linda study estimates that about 20 percent of leukemia
cases were linked to smoking.

<TEXT>
   Men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the University of Edinburgh. 

   The analysis, based on a previous study of 248,046 U.S. veterans, offers the firmest link yet between cigarette consumption and the disease. 
The finding could add leukemia to the already lengthy list of suspected health risks from smoking. 

   The report in tomorrow's British Medical Journal "may well have an emotional impact on some people who are vacillating" about quitting smoking "and for one reason or another have a fear of leukemia," suggested Nicholas Wald, an epidemiologist at the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital here. 

   "The balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia," Dr. Wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by University of Edinburgh epidemiologist Leo Kinlen. 

   Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. 
The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. 
Dr. Kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. 

   These heavy smokers had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal leukemia than the veterans who never had smoked. 
For those smoking between 10 and 20 cigarettes a day, the increased risk was 75%. 
And men using fewer than 10 cigarettes daily were 31% more likely to die from leukemia than nonsmokers, according to the report. 

   Previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease. 
For this reason, leukemia "has in general not been regarded as a a malignancy related to smoking," Dr. Kinlen wrote. 

   The latest analysis doesn't prove a causal link, Dr. Kinlen noted in a phone interview. 
But "it is the best evidence to date that the relationship is genuine." 

   If the link is causal, an editorial in the medical journal said, "then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia in adults than all other known causes combined." 
Current known causes include radiation and exposure to the chemical benzene. 

   Leukemia is fairly rare. 
An estimated 18,100 Americans will die from it this year, making the disease the fifth-greatest cause of cancer deaths. 
But leukemia represents the third-leading cause of death in U.S. children, behind accidents and birth defects, according to the American Cancer Society.

<HEAD>Loss of Interferon Genes Linked with Leukemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A form of blood cancer that strikes children
appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the
body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published
today.
   The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's
production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a
role in warding off the development of cancer.
   The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as
regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.
   The researchers, based at the University of Chicago, found an
association between loss of the genes and development of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia.
   They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found
that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes.
   Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list of
cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of
particular genes.
   Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer.
Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes,
are missing.
   Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's
immune defenses and controlling cell growth.
   The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and
beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on
chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
   In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of
the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they left open the possibility
that some other gene in this region besides those that make
interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about one-quarter of
all childhood cancers. It strikes one in every 30,000 children.

<TEXT>
   The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent
higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among
non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.
   While no direct link has been established between smoking and
leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed
that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10
cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and
for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.
   ``If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship
between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is
responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto
established causes combined,'' said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the
Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
   Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veterans
with E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland.
   They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia and
smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that
leukemia is a smoking-related disease.''
   In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas
Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no
cause-and-effect relationship had been established.
   But he added: ``Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence
suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.''
   It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's
list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.
   The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans
between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote. During that period
723 died of leukemia. Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 were
ex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.
   The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate
among smokers was sharply higher than the average.
   Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers
of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared
with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from
lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10
cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
   When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, it
suggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk. The
death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and among
ex-smokers 39 percent.

Cigarette smoking appears to be a major risk factor for the development of 
leukemia and may be responsible for more than 1 in 5 cases of the feared blood 
cancer, according to a study by Loma Linda University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers consider the findings particularly significant because almost 
all of the 34,000 Seventh-day Adventists studied who had smoked had stopped 
years earlier, suggesting that some of the adverse effects may not be 
reversible. The report increases the credence of other recent studies that have 
suggested a link between smoking and leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The results, being published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute, add to a growing list of cancers that have been linked to cigarette 
smoking. The list includes cancers of the lung, bladder, pancreas, esophagus, 
throat and perhaps the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
The study is part of the ongoing Adventist Health Study, a major 
epidemiological investigation of the causes of various cancers among California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of Adventists do not smoke by church proscription, 
many are adult converts to the religion who smoked cigarettes prior to their 
baptism into the church. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the Adventist ex-smokers had twice the risk of 
developing leukemia than similar individuals who never had smoked. 
</P>
<P>
The results are "very discouraging," said Paul K. Mills, an assistant professor 
of preventive medicine at Loma Linda and principal author of the study. "We saw 
a strong association between prior cigarette smoking and the risk of developing 
leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
The findings "obviously strengthen the gathering impression that cigarette 
smoking is related to leukemia risk and that the association is likely to be 
causal," Dr. Clark W. Heath Jr., a vice president of the American Cancer 
Society, wrote in an editorial published in the medical journal along with the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of developing leukemia was also increased by a greater number of 
cigarettes smoked daily and a longer duration of smoking, which Mills said was 
"important evidence of a causal relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who regularly smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day had a threefold 
increased risk of developing leukemia. The Adventists who had smoked for more 
than 15 years had a 2 1/2-fold increased leukemia risk. 
</P>
<P>
Leukemia is a bone-marrow cancer in which the marrow is replaced by immature, 
abnormal white blood cells. Leukemia is a relatively uncommon tumor compared to 
breast, colon or lung cancer. Each year, there are about 27,000 newly diagnosed 
cases and 18,000 deaths attributed to leukemia in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heath, until 1986 it was generally accepted that tobacco use was 
not a significant cause of leukemia. Since 1988, several studies, including a 
large study of U.S. military veterans and two American Cancer Society studies, 
had provided preliminary evidence of a link. 
</P>
<P>
The causes of leukemia are largely unknown. Those that have been identified, 
such as the chemical benzene and ionizing radiation, appear to account for only 
a small percentage of cases, according to Heath. 
</P>
<P>
The Loma Linda study calculated that about 20% of leukemia cases were 
associated with prior smoking. In all, there were 46 new cases of leukemia 
diagnosed during the six-year study period. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this and earlier preliminary studies, Heath estimated that from 
20% to 30% of leukemia cases may be linked to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Because cigarette smoking is very common in the general population -- more than 
25% of adults smoke -- the proportion of total leukemia risk that may be 
attributed to cigarette smoking is significant, according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
In a related finding, the Loma Linda researchers found that ex-smokers among 
the Adventists had a threefold increased risk of developing myeloma, another 
bone-marrow tumor, as compared to individuals who had never smoked. Mills 
cautioned that this result should be considered "preliminary" because it was 
based on 23 cases. Previously, this association has not been closely examined. 
</P>
<P>
The Adventist Health Study began in 1974. Participants in the current study 
completed a questionnaire about their lifestyle in 1976 and were followed for 
the development of new cancers through the end of 1982.

   The natural protein interferon, combined with
standard chemotherapy drugs, shows promise in controlling multiple
myeloma, a lethal form of bone cancer, researchers said Tuesday.
   ``We finally have a leg up on arresting the natural progression
of the disease and producing patients who are alive at five years,
which has been a rarity,'' said Dr. Martin M. Oken of the
University of Minnesota.
   His research is part of a new effort by scientists to find a
role for interferon by combining it with the drugs that have long
been used to attack cancer.
   Oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancer
has been weakened, but not destroyed, by medicines.
   The work may also represent a revival of the fortunes of
interferon, which has been on a roller coaster of public acclaim
and disdain for a decade.
   Interferon is a natural, hormone-like substance that, among
other things, helps regulate the body's immune system. When the
human gene that makes this chemical was isolated, some experts
predicted many uses for interferon in eliminating cancer and
infections.
   However, studies showed that when used alone, interferon had
little major impact on any cancer except an exceedingly rare
malignancy called hairy cell leukemia, for which it has become
standard therapy.
   In the latest research, presented at the annual meeting of the
American Association of Clinical Oncology, doctors found that
interferon plus chemotherapy produced complete remissions in 30
percent of the 54 patients studied.
   Such remissions, in which all signs of the disease are gone, are
rare in multiple myeloma, and they are the first step toward curing
the disease.
   In all, 41 percent of the patients had remissions that were
complete or nearly complete. In an earlier study, only 11 percent
of the patients reached this level after receiving chemotherapy
alone.
   In another study presented at the meeting, doctors from the
University of North Carolina showed promising early results of
testing interferon against chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   ``These are interesting results,'' said Dr. James Griffin of the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``Response rates can be
improved and toxicity minimized by these recombinant proteins.''
   About 11,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and 5,000 cases of
chronic myelogenous leukemia are found each year.
   This form of leukemia can be effectively treated with bone
marrow transplants. However, many victims do not receive
transplants because no suitable narrow donors are available.
   Dr. Howard Ozer and his colleagues at the University of North
Carolina found they could reduce the outward signs of myelogenous
leukemia and help the body replace defective cells with normal ones.
   ``For the first time, there is a drug available that potentially
keeps the abnormal (cell) clone under control and allows the normal
clone to come back,'' Ozer said.
   His team tested interferon on 112 people with this form of
cancer. They found that 70 percent of them improved, although it is
still too soon to know how the treatment affects long-term survival.
   He said that interferon may have to be given for several years
to keep the disease under control.
   Oken said more study will be needed as well to see how
interferon affects multiple myeloma over time. However, he added,
``I think it's a real advance.''
   Typically, about 30 percent of multiple myeloma patients survive
for five years.
   Just how interferon works against cancer is unclear. Ozer
speculates that it acts as a sort of negative growth regulator,
shutting down bone marrow cells that produce cancerous blood cells.
   Interferon is produced by inserting a human gene into bacteria
or yeast, which can churn out the substance in limitless
quantities. It is just one of several otherwise rare natural
chemicals to be made through genetic engineering.

   Chemotherapy drugs that were used to treat ovarian
cancer may have sharply increased the risk of leukemia, a study has
found.
   Researchers found that among women treated between 1960 and
1985, the risk of leukemia was 12 times higher in those who
received chemotherapy rather than surgery alone, according to the
study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Although the study did not measure the benefits of treatment,
chemotherapy drugs given during that time frequently failed to stop
ovarian cancer. But doctors say that newer drugs now in use against
this form of cancer are more effective, and their benefits probably
outweigh their risks.
   The research, directed by Dr. John M. Kaldor of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, was
based on 114 women with leukemia who were among 99,113 survivors of
ovarian cancer in seven European countries and Canada.
   Doctors have long known that the powerful medicines used to
attack cancer may also cause the disease. The latest research
demonstrates the magnitude of this risk.
   In a second study, the same researchers found that the risk of
leukemia is also substantially increased in people given
chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, another form of cancer. But
since Hodgkin's disease is often curable with drugs, the benefits
of treatment clearly outweigh the risks.
   In this work, the doctors reviewed 163 cases of leukemia among
29,552 Hodgkin's disease patients. They found that the risk of
leukemia was nine times higher among those who got chemotherapy
instead of radiation treatment.
   ``The risk in Hodgkin's disease is well worth it, because the
treatment does extend life. In ovarian cancer, it's not necessarily
worth it,'' commented Dr. Charles A. Coltman Jr. of the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
   Several of the cancer drugs taken by the European women for
ovarian cancer are no longer used.
   ``Management of ovarian cancer is moving ahead very rapidly,''
said Coltman. ``Some of the more recent studies suggest an impact
on survival'' that outweighs the increased risk of leukemia.

   Alpha interferon, a natural disease fighter
already used to treat leukemia, can now be used to battle Kaposi's
sarcoma, a cancer that primarily attacks AIDS patients.
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that alpha
interferon was shown in tests to be effective against Kaposi's and
now is approved for treatment of the cancer that has become common
among AIDS victims.
   Alpha interferon is a disease-fighter that is present in the body
naturally in small amounts, but has been artifically produced in
large quantities in recent years through the use of gene-splicing
techniques. It previously had been approved for treatment of
hairy-cell leukemia and for genital warts.
   Frank E. Young, FDA commissioner, said approval of the man-made
alpha interferon ``shows biotechnology's emerging role in helping
modern medicine fight some of the most serious diseases which plague
mankind.''
   Kaposi's sarcoma, named for a European doctor who first described
it more than 100 years ago, was a rare cancer until the appearance
early in this decade of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The cancer causes purple or brown lesions on the skin and can
attack the lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Kaposi's can
cause death when it attacks the lungs or other vital organs,
although most AIDS patients die of other causes.
   Alpha interferon was used experimentally to treat Kaposi's in a
number of studies, including some conducted at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National
Institutes of Health.
   Anthony S. Fauci, the NIAID director, said that studies by H.
Clifford Lane of the NIAID ``demonstrated that alpha interferon was
an effective anti-Kaposi's sarcoma agent'' in patients who were in
the early stages of the AIDS infection.
   According to the FDA, several human studies showed that high
doses of alpha inteferon would reduce Kaposi's tumors in 40 to 45
percent of patients who were in early stages of the AIDS infection.
   AIDS patients who were helped most were those whose blood showed
a T4-helper cell count of above 200 per square centimeter, and who
have not experienced other opportunistic infections. T4-helper cells
are part of the body's immune system and are attacked by the AIDS
virus. Healthy people have a T4-helper cell count of 800 to 1,000.
   Those with more advanced AIDS tend to have T4-helper cell counts
below 200 and do not benefit from the alpha interferon treatment.
   Alpha interferon was first identified in 1957 as a hormone-like
protein that is a natural disease-fighting component of the blood.
In the early 1980s, researchers were able to insert the gene coded
for alpha interferon into a bacteria which then produces the protein
in large quantities. This is the technique called gene-splicing.
   The FDA said that alpha interferon is marketed by Schering Corp.
of Kenilworth, N.J., under the brand name Intron-A, and by
Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J. under the brand name Roferon. Both
products were first approved in 1986 for the treatment of hairy-cell
leukemia, and last June for the treatment of genital warts.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through contact with
blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. AIDS is
incurable and fatal.
   As of Nov. 7, AIDS had been diagnosed in 77,994 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 43,888, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the government.

<HEAD>Form of Vitamin A Turns Cancer Cells into Normal Ones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a unique assault on leukemia, doctors have
found that a form of vitamin A will turn cancer cells into normal
ones.
   Medicine's usual way of combating cancer is to kill it. Doctors
administer powerful toxic drugs in the hopes that they will destroy
more cancerous cells than healthy ones.
   The new approach instead tries to reform cancer cells. It
changes the cells' genetic program, bypassing the genetic mix up
that makes them kill. In this way, the treatment induces the cancer
cells to live, to grow and eventually to die by the same rules that
govern the rest of the body.
   The drug, a synthetic form of vitamin A called all-trans
retinoic acid, was developed in China and tested in France. Though
it has drawbacks and works in just one rare form of leukemia,
doctors hope it will provide clues for short-circuiting the basic
errors that underlie all cancers.
   ``The dogma has been to try to kill cancer cells,'' said Dr.
Laurent Degos. ``Is it possible to change a cell, and not kill it,
so it becomes normal?''
   Degos, a researcher at Hopital Saint-Louis in Paris, presented
evidence that this indeed is possible in a report Tuesday at the
annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   He tested the drug on victims of acute promyelocytic leukemia, a
rare blood cancer that strikes a few hundred people in the United
States each year. All of them had failed earlier standard therapy.
   He achieved complete, though often temporary, elimination of all
signs of the disease in 16 of 17 patients who had relapsed for the
first time. There was complete remission in one of four patients
who had relapsed a second time.
   ``There was no killing of cells, but they change,'' said Degos.
``We see more mature cells.''
   This form of leukemia is caused by a specific genetic defect,
the mislocation of a piece of one string of genes, or chromosome,
onto another chromosome. As a result, the cells get stuck in their
juvenile stage. They fail to mature normally and eventually die.
   Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid appears to bump the cells
past this roadblock in their development so they grow old.
   ``This is a smashing development,'' commented Dr. Charles
Schiffer of the University of Maryland. ``It has impressed even the
most cynical. This is a different approach to anything we have done
in this disease in the past.''
   Dr. Bruce Chesen of the National Cancer Institute said the
institute plans soon to sponsor four small safety studies of the
drug. Once those are done, it will begin a larger review of its
effectiveness.
   Though the synthetic vitamin wiped out obvious signs of the
leukemia, the disease frequently came back, apparently because some
cancer cells were resistant to the drug. Degas said it may be
necessary to combine the treatment with standard chemotherapy to
try to obliterate the few remaining cancer cells.
   The drug was developed in China by Wang Zeng Yi, dean of
Shanghai University II, a French-speaking medical school. It is now
being produced by Hoffman LaRoche, the pharmaceutical firm.
   In an earlier report, doctors said they found that the acne
medicine Accutane, another synthetic form of vitamin A, prevents
new tumors from developing in people treated for smoking-related
throat cancer.
   Among other research presented at the meeting:
   _Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute
outlined the first results of his pioneering attempt to insert
foreign genes into cancer patients. The initial effort, carried out
on seven melanoma patients, was intended to show that gene therapy
is possible.
   Doctors removed cancer-fighting blood cells from the patients'
tumors, inserted a bacteria gene into them and then put them back
into the patients' bodies. The manipulated cells zeroed in on their
tumors. The doctors hope soon to repeat the experiment, this time
inserting a gene that produces a cancer-killing chemical called
tumer necrosis factor.
   _A survey of American and Caribbean blacks in central Brooklyn
showed that a surprising 4 percent were infected with
cancer-causing human T-cell leukemia virus Type 1, or HTLV-I. Dr.
Harvey Dosik of Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn said the
infection rate is 200 times higher than that seen nationwide in
blood donors.
   _Dr. Lode J. Swinnen of Loyola University in Chicago said he had
found evidence that OKT3, an antibody treatment widely given to
recipients of organ transplants, significantly increases their risk
of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer. He reviewed 154 heart
transplant patients and found that 11 percent of those getting OKT3
since 1986 had developed the disease.

   People infected by the AIDS virus may be more
likely to go on to develop the deadly disease if they also are
infected by a related virus that can cause a particularly fatal
form of leukemia, a study says.
   ``These laboratory results suggest that doubly infected
individuals have a worse prognosis for developing AIDS'' than those
who are infected only by the AIDS virus, said molecular virologist
Irvin S.Y. Chen, who published his study in Friday's issue of the
journal Science.
   ``The chances of any individual being infected by both viruses
are very slim, but among selected populations, such as intravenous
drug abusers, the chances are quite high,'' said Chen, of the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   Except among IV drug abusers, the leukemia virus is quite rare
in the United States. It is fairly common in southern Japan, the
Caribbean and parts of Africa, Chen said. So the study suggests
that people in those areas may be more likely to develop
full-fledged AIDS if they are exposed to the AIDS virus.
   But more study of people infected by both viruses must be done
to confirm the suspicion raised by laboratory studies, said Dr.
Stanley H. Weiss, chief of AIDS epidemiology at New Jersey Medical
School in Newark. Weiss is already undertaking such research in the
Newark and New York area.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which usually remains dormant in
infected people for years before it may be activated to cause
full-fledged AIDS, which cripples the disease-fighting immune
system.
   Previous studies suggested almost any infection may help trigger
the dormant AIDS virus into an active killer.
   Chen and his colleagues performed experiments in laboratory
culture dishes showing that AIDS-infected white blood cells called
T cells produce large amounts of active AIDS virus if the cells
also are exposed to the human T-cell leukemia virus type I, or
HTLV-I.
   People infected by HTLV-I have a 1 percent lifetime chance of
developing a blood cancer called adult T-cell leukemia, which often
kills quickly. It is an important cause of leukemia in southern
Japan and the Caribbean. HTLV-I also is linked to a potentially
fatal, degenerative nerve disease that causes spasticity and
paralysis of the legs.
   Last month, the American Red Cross recommended that all donated
blood be tested for HTLV-I as soon as scientists develop a
practical test. A Red Cross study found about one out of every
4,286 units of donated blood carries HTLV-I. The risk of AIDS virus
in blood has been reduced to about one in 40,000 units because
donors are tested for signs of AIDS infection.
   A study performed by Weiss when he worked for the National
Cancer Institute showed HTLV-I is spreading among intravenous drug
abusers, with infection rates of 12 percent among New Jersey
addicts, 33 percent among New Orleans addicts overall, and 49
percent among black addicts in New Orleans.
   Intravenous drug addicts also are high risk for infection by the
AIDS virus, which also is spread in blood on shared needles and by
sexual contact.
   Infection by HTLV-I apparently activates the AIDS virus by
stimulating AIDS-infected white blood cells to divide, according to
the study Chen performed with molecular virologists Jerome Zack,
Alan Cann and James Lugo.
   While the study in Science deals only with HTLV-I, unpublished
laboratory results suggest full-fledged AIDS also may be triggered
in AIDS-infected people who also are infected by HTLV-II, an
extremely rare virus that can cause another type of leukemia.
   The AIDS virus is distantly related to the leukemia viruses.
   Dr. Edward L. Murphy Jr., a National Cancer Institute expert on
HTLV-I, agreed with Chen that the problem of dual infection by the
AIDS and leukemia viruses is mainly a problem for U.S. drug addicts
and for people in areas such as the Caribbean.

   A pharmaceutical company said Thursday it has
begun selling a new leukemia drug, the fourth new cancer agent
since 1983 and the third leukemia drug in 10 years to gain federal
approval.
   Novantrone mitoxantrone hydrochloride is to be used in
combination with other agents for treating adults with acute
nonlymphocytic leukemia, Lederle Laboratories said in a statement.
   The disease strikes about 8,000 Americans a year, the statement
said. The drug apparently disrupts the functioning of genetic
material in cancer cells, the company said.
   Novantrone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
1987, but the agency's official rating of the drug indicates it
represents little or no advantage over other treatments.
   The other three new cancer drugs approved in the past five years
are etoposide for testicular cancer, approved in 1983; leuprolide
acetate for advanced prostate cancer, 1985; and interferon,
approved in 1986 to fight hairy cell leukemia, said Dr. John
Johnson of the FDA.
   Lederle is a division of American Cyanamid Co.

Experts Say</HEAD>

   Researchers report today they have succeeded
in giving a form of human leukemia to laboratory mice, producing an
animal that now can be used to test therapies against the disease.
   ``With this new animal model, experimental therapies that might
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these
mice,'' said George Daley, lead researcher in the study conducted
at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge,
Mass.
   ``You obviously can do more with the mice than you could with
human patients,'' he said.
   The study, published today in Science, says the Whitehead
researchers used intricate genetic engineering to inject into the
bone marrow of laboratory mice the human gene linked to chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), a form of a blood cancer that usually
attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   Daley said the study also proves CML is initiated by the fusion
of parts from two broken chromosomes, a finding that was suggested
by earlier studies in other laboratories. Those parts have been
identified as the so-called ABL gene from chromosome 9 and a gene
called BCR from chromosome 22.
   Cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein, called
P210, that changes healthy cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said his study showed that transferring the BCR@ABL gene
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into
healthy mice could produce CML in those mice.
   ``It answers a question of basic science, that is, what causes
the disease,'' said Daley. ``We now know that the BCR@ABL gene is
sufficient to induce the leukemia.''
   He said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.
   Dr. George Canellos, chief of medical oncology at the
Dana-Farber Institute in Boston, said the Whitehead finding is ``an
important advance in understanding the disease.''
   He said the new animal model of the disease may help scientists
find ways to block the action of the P210 protein produced by the
BCR@ABL gene, thus preventing the disease.
   ``In screening biological substances, it will make a very nice
model,'' said Canellos.
   Daley said the mouse can be used to test ``biological
inhibitors'' that would prevent the P210 protein from transforming
normal cells into cancers. Such inhibitors formally could only be
tested on human patients, a process that could take years. With a
mouse model of the disease, experiments can be sped up and can be
more extensive.
   To create the mouse model, Daley said he and his colleagues
inserted the human BCR@ABL gene into a virus. Normal mouse bone
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus, which transferred the
gene into the marrow cells.
   Thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone
marrow cells. Next, the bone marrow carrying the BCR@ABL gene was
transplanted into the 30 mice.
   Within five months, 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   CML in humans can be controlled by chemotherapy for 3 to 5
years. This remission period usually ends with the sudden increase
in abnormal cells, a disease phase called ``blast crisis'' that
usually results in death. The only successful therapy used now is
to kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor, but even this
treatment often fails.
   Daley said that continued studies of the CML mice show that many
of the laboratory animals develop the ``blast crisis'' phase of the
disease. This, he said, is further verification that the course of
the disease in the mice mimics CML in humans.
   Richard A. Van Etten and David Baltimore, both of the Whitehead
Institute, were coauthors of the study with Daley. Science, which
published the study, is the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

<TEXT>
   Increases in leukemia among young people living
near nuclear plants are not caused by exposure to radiation, said a
study released Friday.
   Researchers found that death rates from leukemia and Hodgkin's
disease among young people were about as high in areas that were
only considered for nuclear plants as in areas that actually
contained nuclear plants.
   Hodgkin's disease is a cancer of the lymph glands. Researchers
said it has never been linked to radiation exposure.
   The cause of heightened cancer rates found in the study remains
a mystery.
   But the researchers said their findings indicate an increased
risk of leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation, with
the possible exception of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant
on England's northwest coast.
   The Sellafield plant has been plagued by radioactive leaks.
Government studies have found a 10-fold increase in childhood
leukemia a mile from the plant, and concluded the plant is linked
to the disease.
   In the study released Friday, researchers from the Medical
Research Council and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said the new
findings suggest that areas near existing and potential nuclear
sites might share ``unrecognized risk factors other than
environmental radiation pollution.''
   Dr. Sarah Darby of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said the
findings point to something possibly ``in the lifestyle of the
young but at the present time we don't have a great deal of handle
on it.''
   The researchers investigated death statistics in 400 districts
of England and Wales near existing or potential nuclear sites. The
results were published in the The Lancet, a weekly medical journal.
   ``Excess mortality due to leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in
young people who lived near potential sites was similar to that in
young people who lived near existing sites,'' researchers wrote.
   Ms. Darby said: ``There was a 16 percent increase in childhood
leukemia mortality in areas near nuclear installations compared
with the rest of the country after adjusting for factors such as
urban-rural status. When the same analysis was carried out for
areas near potential installations, there was a 14 percent
increase.''
   ``We carried out this study because estimates of radiation
received by children living near nuclear installations are
extremely low, and it has been suggested that increases in the
number of deaths are not caused by the presence of the
installations, but by some other feature of the districts in which
they tend to be built,'' she said.
   The new findings on leukemia bolster this hypothesis, the
researchers wrote. Other previous theories, such as those involving
exposure to radon gas or viruses, could not account for all the
excess cancers in young people, they said.
   Ms. Darby said the study also would disprove stress or
psychosomatic illness being a possible cause since most people
living around the potential sites ``wouldn't have been worried
about it.''
   She said the main theory that needs investigation is ``that
people who are exposed less frequently to infection very early in
life are at a slightly higher risk of leukemia later on.''
   Mel Greaves of the Leukemia Research Fund, who originated the
theory, ``has biological reasons for thinking that is the case,''
she said.
   ``Our data support that,'' she said, explaining that areas with
a higher proportion of people in the upper social classes had a
slightly higher risk of leukemia than people in areas with a higher
proportion of manual workers.

<HEAD>Mouse Model For Human Leukemia May Help Fight Killer Disease,
Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers, using an intricate manipulation
of genes and transplantation of bone marrow, have produced a mouse
that suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving
scientists a new way to test therapies against the killer disease.
   In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science,
researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research said
they have discovered a way to give chronic myelogenous leukemia,
CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of leukemia that usually
attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   ``With this new animal model, experimental therapies that might
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these
mice,'' said George Daley, lead researcher in the study at
Whitehead. ``You obviously can do more with the mice than you could
with human patients.''
   Daley said the study also proves that CML is initiated by the
fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes, a finding that had
been suggested by earlier studies in other laboratories. Those
parts have been identified as the so-called ABL gene from
chromosome 9 and a gene called BCR from chromosome 22.
   Cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein, called
P210, that changes healthy cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said his study showed that transferring the BCR@ABL gene
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into
healthy mice could produce CML in those mice.
   ``It answers a question of basic science, that is, what causes
the disease,'' said Daley. ``We now know that the BCR@ABL gene is
sufficient to induce the leukemia.''
   He said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.
   Dr. George Canellos, chief of medical oncology at the
Dana-Farber Institute in Boston, described the Whitehead finding as
``an important advance in understanding the disease.''
   He said the new animal model of the disease possibly may help
scientists find ways to block the action of the P210 protein
produced by the BCR@ABL gene, thus preventing the disease.
   Daley said that the mouse can be used to test ``biological
inhibitors'' that would prevent the P210 protein from transforming
normal cells into cancers. Such inhibitors formally could only be
tested on human patients, a process that could take years. With a
mouse model of the disease, experiments can be speeded up and can
be more extensive.
   To create the mouse model, Daley said he and his collegues
inserted the human BCR@ABL gene into a virus. Normal mouse bone
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus, which transferred the
gene into the marrow cells.
   Thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone
marrow cells. The bone marrow carrying the BCR@ABL gene was then
transplanted into the 30 mice.
   Within five months, 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   CML in humans can be controlled by chemotherpy for 3 to 5 years.
This remission period usually ends with the sudden increase in
abnormal cells, a disease phase called ``blast crisis'' that
usually results in death. The only successful therapy now is to
kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor, but even this
treatment often fails.
   Daley said that continued studies of the CML mice shows that
many of the laboratory animals develop the ``blast crisis'' phase
of the disease. This, he said, is further verification that the
course of the disease in the mice is similar to CML in humans.
   Co-authors of the study with Daley were Richard A. Van Etten and
David Baltimore, both of the Whitehead Institute. Science, which
published the study, is the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

<HL> More Data Emerges That Cancer Virus Is Tainting U.S. Blood-Bank Supply </HL>
<AUTHOR> Jerry E. Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   More evidence emerged that a cancer virus is contaminating the nation's supply of banked blood. 

   Researchers in New York City reported evidence that some hospital patients who had received multiple blood transfusions had been infected with the virus. 
This follows other, tentative reports in recent months hinting that 1% to 4% of blood donors in some localities and as many as 9% of drug addicts tested in New York City may be infected with the virus. 

   Such reports prompted the American Red Cross last November to urge rapid development and federal approval of a definitive test that could be used to screen blood donors for evidence of infection by the cancer virus. 

   The cancer virus is related to the AIDS virus and is believed to be spread by the same routes, that is, by blood transfusions, sexual contact and the sharing of contaminated needles among drug addicts. 
The virus is known to cause a rare but rapidly fatal type of leukemia that, until now, has been confined largely to southern Japan, and certain areas in Africa and the Caribbean. 
It also has been linked to a multiple sclerosis -- like nerve ailment, called tropical spastic paraparesis, occurring in children in the Caribbean. 

   The virus is known as HTLV-1, for human T-cell leukemia virus. 

   The presence of the virus in the blood supply poses an unusual public health dilemma. 
Although only 1% of people infected with the virus develop leukemia, the blood cancer doesn't occur until many years, perhaps decades, after the initial infection. 
An increase in the incidence of leukemia that would confirm that the virus is spreading among Americans mightn't occur for another decade. 
By that time, millions might have become infected, leading to an epidemic of tens of thousands of cases lasting well into the next century. 

   The newest evidence of the virus's presence in the blood supply was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine by a research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 
They tested blood samples from 211 patients who had been treated at the center for various types of leukemia. 
None of the patients suffered the T-cell type of leukemia caused by the virus, but all had received multiple transfusions of blood during their therapy. 
Six of the patients had antibodies to HTLV-1, indicating they had been exposed to the virus. 
All of these patients died of their blood cancers long before there was any chance of developing disease from the HTLV-1. 

   The researchers said they couldn't determine when the six patients had been infected. 
The tests were run on blood samples that had been taken and stored for other reasons. 
But in three of the patients, samples were available that were taken before the transfusions. 
These were negative for the virus antibodies, while samples from the same patients taken after transfusions were positive. 
There wasn't any way of determining who donated the contaminated blood. 

   Last fall, the Red Cross said it had completed preliminary screening of blood from 40,000 healthy donors and found 10 who might be positive for HTLV-1 exposure. 
More elaborate and time-consuming tests now are being done to check the accuracy of this preliminary screening. 
This prevalence, though tiny, is about the same as the prevalence of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus in donated blood before screening programs began. 

   Studies in Japan have confirmed that HTLV-1 can be transmitted by blood transfusions, but so far there aren't any known cases of T-cell leukemia developing in people so infected. 
The New York scientists noted, however, that patients such as theirs, who receive multiple transfusions, can serve as a "sensitive indicator" of the virus's presence in the blood supply.

<HEAD>Interferon Provides First Cure for Hepatitis B</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported finding the first
treatment capable of relieving and even curing chronic hepatitis B,
one of the world's biggest killers.
   A study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that
shots of a synthetic form of the natural protein interferon can
prevent the virus from destroying the liver in nearly half the
people chronically infected.
   One in 10 victims can be cured, while the drug had no benefits
for 60 percent of the 169 people studied in clinical trials,
researchers said.
   Hepatitis B is the chief underlying cause of liver cancer and
cirrhosis and the world's ninth-leading cause of death, just behind
lung disease and well ahead of AIDS, according to the World Health
Organization.
   An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the United
States are long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus. At least
half of them have liver disease. Worldwide, 300 million people, or
5 percent of the world's population, are chronically infected.
   Until now, there has been no treatment or cure for the virus.
   ``This is an encouraging result. All of us would feel a lot
happier if we had a better treatment. This spurs us on to find
that,'' said Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg of the Fox Chase Cancer Center
in Philadelphia.
   Blumberg won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1976 for identifying
the virus.
   The latest research, which involved 169 people at 12 hospitals,
confirms several smaller studies suggesting that interferon works.
   Other studies have also shown that interferon works against
hepatitis C, another serious but less common variety of the virus.
   Although the Food and Drug Administration has not yet
recommended interferon for hepatitis B, physicians can use it any
way they choose, and Blumberg said some doctors have already begun
prescribing it for this disease.
   Doctors said the latest study is big enough so physicians can
use the results to predict how interferon will affect their
patients if _ as seems likely _ it becomes the standard medicine
for hepatitis B.
   ``We can be relatively sure what doctors will find in practice:
Ten percent will be cured and 40 or 50 percent will be made better
and their liver disease will be stopped in its tracks,'' said Dr.
Robert P. Perrillo of the St. Louis Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, the principal author of the study.
   He defined a cure as the complete disappearance of the virus.
   Experts cautioned the treatment should be used only for those
with chronic infections who show signs of liver damage.
   The results were published along with an editorial by Dr. Jay H.
Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases.
   ``For now, interferon alpha offers the best hope'' for treating
chronic hepatitis B, Hoofnagle wrote.
   Hepatitis is likely to become the first major use for
interferon. Isolating the natural disease-fighting substance was
one of the early goals of genetic engineering.
   In a decade of testing, interferon has turned out to be useful
against a variety of diseases, none as common as hepatitis. The FDA
has approved use of the drug for hairy-cell leukemia, AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma and genital warts.
   In hepatitis B, Perrillo said the treatment appears to offer the
best chance of a cure if given during the first two years of
infection.

<HL> Concerns Grow That Cancer Virus
Is Spreading in Same Ways as AIDS

   Researchers are quietly conducting a large-scale sampling of the nation's blood supply to see if a rare virus capable of causing cancer and, possibly, a mysterious nerve disease is being spread among Americans. 

   The virus, until now, has been confined to small areas of Japan, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. 
It is, however, similar to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Now, scientists are increasingly concerned that the virus, which can cause a form of adult leukemia, is being transmitted like AIDS: through an exchange of blood by hypodermic syringes, sexual practices or transfusions. 

   Although it is far too early to tell how many people have been infected and how many will actually develop cancer or the nerve disease, evidence already suggests that many drug addicts in the U.S. have been exposed to the virus. 
And there is at least one cluster of cases of the rare leukemia in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, although doctors don't know how the victims acquired the virus. 

   In an unannounced move, the American Red Cross late last week began testing for evidence of the virus in blood donated by 30,000 people in six unidentified cities around the country. 
The effort follows the federal government's approval of an experimental test kit to detect antibodies to the virus. 
The sampling, while technically a trial of the accuracy of the new blood test, should also indicate whether the cancer virus is enough of a threat for blood banks to begin routine screening of donated blood as is now done for AIDS and hepatitis. 

   "We have evidence now that a virus spread by blood and associated with a very serious disease has been detected in the U.S.," says S. Gerald Sandler, medical director of the Red Cross. 
"Since this is happening, it is the responsibility of the American Red Cross to be at the head of a scientific investigation to quantify the incidence of the virus's presence and spread." 

   Adds Bernard Poiesz, head of the division of hematology-oncology at the State University of New York in Syracuse: "Incidence of the virus in the U.S. has been sporadic, but it is increasing now. 
We are now beginning to realize that the virus is causing a real health problem in this country." 

   The virus poses an unusual threat because of its long latency period. 
People infected with the virus may not develop leukemia for several years. 
Thus, if the virus is spreading now, it may be a decade before enough leukemia cases develop to trigger the nation's epidemic alarm system. 
No one knows what percentage of infected individuals will develop leukemia or the nerve disease. 

   Although the cancer threat alone has worried health officials for several months, those concerns have increased following reports that link the virus with a nerve condition known as tropical spastic paraparesis or TSP, explains William A. Blattner of the environmental epidemiology branch of the National Cancer Institute. 

   The nerve disease is similar to multiple sclerosis and afflicts muscle function. 
It was first identified in the 1960s in Jamaica. 
Last fall, however, French researchers in Martinique linked the nerve disease to the virus after finding that many TSP victims had been infected with the leukemia virus. 
Subsequently, Japanese researchers found that many TSP victims in Japan had previously had blood transfusions. 

   Although the incidence of TSP in the U.S. isn't known, the links between the leukemia virus, the nerve disease and blood transfusions have apparently spurred the preliminary screening of blood supplies by the Red Cross. 

   The virus is known as human T-cell leukemia virus one, or HTLV-I. 
The T cell is a particular type of white blood cell that is infected and turned malignant by the virus. 
Less than a decade ago, U.S. and Japanese scientists proved that HTLV-I was responsible for a type of leukemia seen in southern Japan. 
The virus thus became the first virus proved to cause a human cancer. 
So far, it is the only proven human cancer virus, although many patients infected with the AIDS virus develop a previously rare type of skin cancer. 

   The rare leukemia, once it develops, is devastating. 
"The median survival is three months," says Harvey Dosik, director of medicine at the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. Dr. Dosik and his colleagues have seen 15 cases of the leukemia in the past two years. 
"Only one of the 15 is still alive," he says. 

   The 15 cases constitute the largest cluster of the leukemia in the U.S. 
The victims were all blacks who moved into the Bedford-Stuyvesant ghetto in Brooklyn from the Carribbean and the southern U.S., areas where the presence of the virus has been known for some time. 
None of the 15 victims was known to be an intravenous drug user, Dr. Dosik says. 
Mainly because of the lack of funds, researchers have been unable to explore the victims' backgrounds to discover what they might have in common that would account for the disease, Dr. Dosik says. 

   Evidence of the virus's spread among Americans comes largely from tests of drug addicts. 
In 1984, British health officials, while screening for AIDS, first noted that about 4% of addicts there had developed antibodies to HTLV-I, evidence that they had been exposed to the virus. 

   Earlier this year, a team from the U.S. National Institutes of Health checked blood samples taken five years ago from 56 drug addicts in the Queens section of New York. 
The results indicated that as early as 1981 as many as 9% of the intravenous drug addicts had been exposed to HTLV-I. 
If the spread of the AIDS virus since then is any kind of index for the growth of HTLV-I, the virus is presumably even more widespread now. 

   Some researchers are also worried that blood screening such as that being done by the Red Cross may not give a broad enough picture of the prevalence of HTLV-I. 
Blood banks have been carefully excluding donors who are at risk of developing AIDS -- but those are the people who are also most likely to have been exposed to HTLV-I. 
Thus, sampling only donated blood might result in underestimating the true extent of the virus. 

   The Red Cross screening program was made possible by the development of test kits by Cellular Products Co., a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, and by Du Pont Co. in Wilmington, Del. 
Both companies already produce tests to detect the AIDS virus, and the new tests use the same technology. 

   Cellular Products began working on a test at the "insistence of Dr. Poiesz" in Syracuse, "who told us he was seeing enough instances in his lab to warrant nationwide screening soon," says Richard Montagna, Cellular's president. 
Dr. Poiesz, a scientific adviser to Cellular, is an expert on the HTLV-I virus; he helped identify the virus in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute in 1978. 
Dr. Poiesz's lab has been testing blood samples from around the world, but the lab's test isn't simple enough for use by blood banks. 

   A Du Pont spokesman says the company is gearing up to produce six million test kits a year, based on Du Pont's own studies of the spread of the virus. 
Based on these studies, he adds, the company believes there will be a need within a few years for about 50 million to 75 million test kits, about the same number currently used to screen for the AIDS virus.

<TEXT>
   In your second-front-page article "Approved Drugs Find Unapproved Uses" (July 12), your approach to the problem of Food and Drug Administration approval of medicines fails to take into account the complexities of modern medicine. 
For example, picture yourself sitting in front of me in my office. 

   "Mr. 
X," I might begin, "you unfortunately have a rare cancer of the adrenal gland. 
Treatment of this is very difficult, and up to this point, all patients with this have died. 
However, at one of our recent cancer meetings, there were two reports that a combination of the chemotherapy drugs etoposide and cisplatin were able to shrink this cancer in 10 of 11 patients. 
These are not experimental drugs, but drugs well known to us for the treatment of other cancers. 
Unfortunately, these drugs are not approved for this cancer, since adrenocortical cancer strikes only a few hundred patients a year." 

   "Well, Doc," you answer, "I'll go ahead and take the drugs anyway; those odds sound pretty good." 

   "Yes, they do, Mr. X. Unfortunately, your insurer does not pay for any medicines given for 'unapproved' indications. 
Since you have a rare disease, you certainly cannot expect these drug companies to spend millions of dollars to get approval for such a rare problem, can you? 
If you owned stock in them, you'd throw the management out. 
I'd like to give you the drugs, but since you live in Massachusetts, your insurer makes me take assignment for your treatment, and not only will they not pay me, by law you can't pay me out of your pocket either. 
These are expensive drugs, and we can't give them away." 

   "But Doc, you're an expert in cancer medicine; certainly if you tell the insurer that this is the best thing for me, it will be OK." 

   "I wish it were that simple, Mr. X," I go on, "but your policy clearly states that only drugs approved by the FDA for that disease can be reimbursed; how else can they hold down runaway costs? 
But don't feel bad; you're not alone. 
Why, when etoposide first came out every oncologist already knew that it was the best single drug for small cell lung cancer. 
There are a lot of those patients (why couldn't you get a common disease?) and it only took the FDA a few years to approve the application for that use. 
Of course, the average patient with that disease lived only 11 months then, but what are 10,000 or 20,000 lives compared with the safety of a whole country, not to mention the asset base of the insurance companies?" 

   "Well, I certainly understand the problem, Doc. 
Let's just write to the FDA, tell them the facts you told me, and they'll approve it." 

   "You may understand your problem, Mr. X, but you don't understand the FDA. First of all, they require a fairly large amount of data to approve a drug, but there aren't enough cases of your disease in a year to give a large enough data base. 
Second, only the company that manufactures the drug can apply for approval. 
As we discussed, that usually requires several years and costs tens of millions of dollars. 
Once a drug is on the market for a common disease, why on earth should they spend the money for a rare disease? 
They'd never make back their investment." 

   "But, Doc, I'm going to die of this," you plead. 
"This just isn't fair. 
Anyway, my insurance broker always told me it would pay for everything." 

   "I sympathize, but think of the whole country. 
Why, this policy has saved thousands from damaging their scalps trying to grow hair with minoxidil. 
Anyway, this morning already, I've had to tell one women with chronic myelocytic leukemia that I would like to treat her with alpha-interferon, but unfortunately she didn't have hairy cell leukemia. 
Another woman with breast cancer needed mitoxantrone, and I tried to figure out how I could convince her insurer that she had acute leukemia." 

   "Doc, at least my insurance premiums have been held down. 
But how could we have come to something like this, in this day and age? 
I figured that by 1990 we'd have thought about it." 

   "Well, at least you won't have to worry about the side effects."

<HEAD>Cell Purification Heralds Improvements In Bone Marrow Transplants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists say they took a step toward
improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and
radiation sickness by purifying, or isolating, a type of cell
crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice.
   Isolation of the special cell type, called a stem cell, eluded
researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at Stanford
University Medical Center in Northern California and Royal
Melbourne Hospital in Australia.
   The research is outlined in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.
   The researchers are well on their way to purifying human stem
cells and growing them in the laboratory, an accomplishment that
could make bone marrow transplantation safer and more available,
said Dr. Irving Weissman, a Stanford professor of pathology and
cancer biology who headed the study team.
   Bone marrow transplants are used to replace damaged or diseased
marrow, the substance inside bones that produces blood and provides
immunity from disease.
   Transplant recipients include some leukemia patients, other
cancer patients made ill by chemotherapy and radiation therapy,
people sickened by accidental radiation exposure, and those with
certain disorders of the blood and the immune system.
   Only about one in 20,000 cells in bone marrow is a stem cell,
said Weissman. But the rare cells are ultimately responsible for
making and replacing other short-lived blood cells, including red
cells, platelets and the B and T types of white blood cells
responsible for immunity.
   As a result, stem cells are the most important part of
transplanted bone marrow. But such transplants often fail unless
the donor and recipient are matched closely. That's because some
white blood cells in donor marrow attack the recipient's tissues in
a sort of reverse rejection called graft-versus-host disease.
   If human stem cells can be purified, they might be transplanted
without other cells in bone marrow, thus avoiding the failure of
the transplants, Weissman said.
   Purified human stem cells also could eliminate the need to find
closely matched marrow donors, making marrow transplants more
widely available, he added.
   Pure stem cells also could make it safer for leukemia patients
to have some of their own marrow removed and then have it replaced
later after they have been subjected to radiation therapy.
Radiation kills the remaining marrow at the same time it kills
cancer cells in marrow, he said.
   When leukemia patients have some marrow removed and later
replaced, it can contain some cancer cells, which spur recurrence
of the leukemia, or blood cancer. By separating stem cells from the
extracted marrow, the stem cells can be reimplanted free of any
cancer cells, preventing the cancer from recurring, Weissman said.
   The researcher also said that in several years, purifying human
stem cells could speed development of gene therapy for inherited
blood diseases. Gene therapy involves the replacement of
disease-causing genes _ the basic units of heredity _ with healthy
genes.

   Acne Drug's Success Against Leukemia
   May Lead to New Way to Treat Cancer

   NEW YORK -- Preliminary success with a variation of an
acne drug to treat an adult leukemia may have opened a new
avenue to attack cancer, scientists said.
   Although it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness
of the treatment, 16 of 20 patients treated up to nine months
ago have been in remission of their blood cancer, researchers
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here reported.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because of the way the acne drug is thought to work, the
results support a new concept of cancer chemotherapy. In the
type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells
have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell
development. Their arrested development is what renders them
practically immortal and dangerous.
   The acne drug is believed to trigger these immature but
malignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentially
a natural death. This new concept of triggering cancer cells
to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of
chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells.
   The drug used in the experimental treatment is known as
tretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals called
retinoic acids that are related to vitamin A. Tretinoin is
sold in ointment form as Retin-A, the acne medication
produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceutical
division. The tretinoin used in the leukemia patients,
however, is a pill that was prepared for the experiment by
chemists at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the U.S. arm of Roche
Holding Ltd. of Switzerland. Roche, which has a long history
of making retinoic acids, sells one of its acids as Accutane,
a pill for treating severe acne.
   The particular form of leukemia that appears to respond
readily to the acne-drug type of treatment is called acute
promyelocytic leukemia. It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting
about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the
bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into
fully functioning white blood cells. The malignant, immature
white cells (known as myelocytes) flood the blood stream,
producing fatigue, fever, weight loss and bleeding.
   Until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs
has been the only effective treatment for acute
promyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only about
a third of patients.
   The tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effective
in treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, Dr.
Raymond P. Warrell Jr. of Memorial Sloan-Kettering and his
colleagues in New York and at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston reported in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have
the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the
structures in the cell that contain all the genes. A piece of
chromosome number 17 appears to have broken loose and become
a part of chromosome number 15.
   Last year, molecular geneticists identified one of the
genes in chromosome 17 that was damaged when the chunk of the
chromosome broke loose. The damaged gene, it turned out,
ordinarily made a protein -- a receptor -- that grabbed hold
of retinoic acid. This and other laboratory findings
suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood
cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the
cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid.
   The nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses of
retinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells to
proceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cells
do.
   "We're now the third group to show remissions {with
tretinoin} in this leukemia," following Chinese and French
researchers, Dr. Warrell said. But, he added, the U.S. group
is the first to show that the drug works by triggering the
immature cancer cells to mature, or to "differentiate," in
the biologists jargon. "We've documented conclusively that
differentiation as a method of cancer therapy in humans is a
reality," he said.

MARROW DONORS DON'T NEED PERFECT MATCH, STUDY FINDS

Medical researchers unveiled new evidence Wednesday showing that doctors don't 
need a perfect match when they try to transplant bone marrow into someone whose 
blood-producing cells have been damaged by leukemia or another deadly illness. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants are usually most successful when the marrow is donated 
by a brother or sister whose cells have the same pattern of surface proteins. 
When the protein pattern matches, it reduces the likelihood that the donated 
marrow will be rejected or produce serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, using special techniques 
to cleanse the donated marrow, found that transplants can be successful when 
the protein pattern in the donor's marrow is similar to, but not identical to, 
the recipient's. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, reported in the current New England Journal of Medicine, suggest 
that "we can now start tapping into the enlarging pool of volunteer marrow 
donors" whose marrow "will lead to satisfactory results for many patients," 
said Dr. Robert C. Ash, chief author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to use marrow from unrelated donors is important because only about 
30% of patients who might benefit from a bone marrow transplant will have a 
brother or sister whose marrow is perfectly matched, Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
This issue was dramatized last week when a 43-year-old Walnut woman disclosed 
that she was having a baby in the hope that the newborn can become a bone 
marrow donor for her 17-year-old daughter, who has leukemia. Tests have shown 
that the fetus's bone marrow is nearly identical. The birth is expected in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-year study of 55 patients, the transplants were successful in 48% 
of patientswith early leukemia, 32% of the volunteers whose leukemia had 
reached an advanced stage, and 63% of the patients who suffered from diseases 
other than leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 31 of the 55 patients died, usually from infection. 
</P>
<P>
Graft-versus-host disease, a potentially deadly reaction that appears when the 
cells of the transplanted marrow attack the body, occurred in nearly half the 
patients. Ash and his colleagues characterized that rate as relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the risk of graftversus-host disease, the donated marrow was 
initially treatedwith chemicals to kill white blood cells that trigger an 
immune response.

   Researchers have been unable to definitively link
fallout from atomic explosions in Nevada during the 1950s to the
higher than normal leukemia rate in neighboring Utah, although a
new study does suggest a link.
   Weapons tests in Nevada by the old U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
may have caused the higher cancer rate in the neighboring state,
but the evidence is weak, according to a study conducted by
University of Utah researchers to be published in next week's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``The excess of acute leukemias in southwestern Utah is probably
not due to chance and may be attributable to fallout radiation.
However, the estimated number of cases attributable to fallout in
this region is small, and these cases are indistinguishable from
other factors,'' the study said.
   If a direct relationship could have been established between
fallout and leukemias ``there would also have been a substantial
number of cases attributable to fallout in the rest of the state,
because of its much larger population,'' the study said. But no
such increased risk was found outside southwest Utah, it said.
   ``There was an excess of acute leukemia cases, but it was not
statistically significant,'' concluded Dr. Joseph L. Lyon, one of
the researchers with the University of Utah's Department of Family
and Preventative Medicine.
   The U.S. House last month approved a bill creating a $100
million trust fund to compensate those living downwind from the
Nevada test site for alleged radiation injuries. Up to 1,300
alleged fallout victims could collect up to $50,000 each under the
legislation, now being considered by the Senate.
   More than 100 atomic bombs were set off above ground in Nevada
between 1951 and 1958, researchers said. Fallout from those blasts
spread across southwestern Utah. In one county, the average
resident was exposed to nearly 30 times as much radiation as
occurred naturally, researchers found.
   But because leukemia leaves no traces as to its source, it was
impossible to determine whether individual deaths were caused by
exposure to fallout, Lyon said Thursday.
   ``You can't say this leukemia was caused by smoking, this one
was caused by radiation _ there's nothing in the disease that says
what it was caused by. You can't sort out the random cases from
those involving fallout,'' Lyon said.
   Researchers analyzed more than 6,500 deaths in Utah between 1952
and 1981 for the $6.8 million, federally funded study. They
confined their analysis to members of the Mormon Church, because
church records could be used to determine who had died and moved
into or out of the area during the testing period.
   Earlier studies indicated the state's leukemia rate was 1.45
times higher than that across the country, and 2.45 times higher
for children. But those studies didn't directly link that higher
rate to radiation fallout, Lyon said.
   The study did show an apparently significant link between
fallout and leukemia among those who were younger than 20 when they
were exposed to the radiation.
   In Washington County, where the highest radiation levels were
recorded, there were 17 leukemia deaths. Five were among people
younger than 20 when exposed, making them nearly eight times more
likely to die from acute leukemia than others their age.
   But researchers said that study sample was too small to be
significant.

<HEAD>Medical Experts Skeptical of Interferon Results in AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHIP BROWN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Medical experts expressed skepticism about
reports that a licensed drug alleviated AIDS patients' symptoms
after it was prepared in a novel way.
   Researchers said data is too inconclusive to embrace the results
reported on Wednesday by Dr. Joseph M. Cummins, head of the
Amarillo Cell Culture Co. Inc.
   Cummins said that alpha interferon given to patients in a wafer
form in small amounts ``has reduced the symptoms of a person
suffering from AIDS.''
   A veterinarian, Cummins said he began experiments with
interferon to treat illnesses in cattle. He offered a pure form of
the drug to Dr. Davy K. Koech, the director of the Kenyan Medical
Research Institute in Nairobi, for use on AIDS patients.
   ``Dr. Koech was desperate enough to try something new,'' Cummins
said Wednesday. ``And he is reporting positive results with every
patient he has treated.''
   In the current issue of Biotechnology Newswatch, Koech reported
that within days of taking oral alpha interferon all of his 99 AIDS
patients in the test group developed an appetite. Fever, diarrhea
and fungal infections and other symptoms subsided, the report said.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Allergy
and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Md., said Wednesday the results
from Africa were ``astounding and very difficult to believe,'' but
``you have to keep an open mind.''
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group in
Washington, D.C., said there is not enough data on the tests to
make an opinion.
   Cummins agreed that more tests need to be done.
   ``People don't have to believe it, but let's test it,'' he said.
``We need to see if it's a true and natural way to treat AIDS.''
   Koech's research showed interferon led to a significant increase
in the number of CD4 lymphocytes, the white blood cell destroyed by
the HIV virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Alpha interferon has been scrutinized for its antiviral activity
since its discovery more than 30 years ago.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved alpha
interferon to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that occurs commonly
among people with AIDS. But the drug has not generally been tested
in pill form because of the belief it would be destroyed by stomach
acid.
   Koech prepared the drug in wafer form so that small doses could
be absorbed through the mouth.
   Cummins said a veterinarian called him last year seeking
interferon ``to treat a big dog for leukemia.'' Cummins later
learned the man had AIDS and was using the interferon to treat
himself.
   The man agreed to talk to The Associated Press upon condition of
anonymiity. The 47-year-old man said interferon was keeping him
alive.
   ``I contracted AIDS along with three other people who split
infected blood during a transfusion,'' he said Wednesday. ``They
are both dead and I am still here.''
   The man, who said he was diagnosed with AIDS three years ago,
said the drug stimulated his appetite, boosted his low CD4 count
and eradicated fever blisters.
   Dr. Jordan U. Gutterman, an interferon expert at the M.D.
Anderson Center in Houston, said Wednesday that Cummins' use of
interferon to treat animals with leukemia produced ``some
intriguing results.''
   ``We are going to start studies ourselves with interferon for
cancer treatment,'' Gutterman said. ``More studies need to be done
to provide confirmation for the results being reported.''

The Strange Story of a Drug
Regarded as Hero and Villain

   THE EPISODE WAS the kind that makes grist for novels and movies. 
A 40-year-old man suffering a severe liver disease had suddenly developed a life-threatening skin condition. 

   "His skin was sloughing off all over his body," recalls Marshall M. Kaplan, the Tufts University gastroenterologist who had been tending the patient's liver problems. 

   Cortisone wasn't helping, "so the question came up whether methotrexate would help," Dr. Kaplan says. 
Methotrexate is an old anti-cancer drug that had been found to aid certain other skin conditions, but it also has a dangerous side effect -- liver damage. 
The idea of using this drug in a man with a diseased liver was "frightening," Dr. Kaplan says. 
"But if we didn't use it, there was a good chance he would die from the skin condition." 

   Balancing the risks, doctors began giving the man methotrexate. 
"We watched his blood tests (for signs of liver damage), fully expecting them to get worse," Dr. Kaplan says. 
Instead, not only did his skin condition clear up, but to the doctors' astonishment, his liver began to improve. 
Now, eight years later, he takes maintenance doses of methotrexate, and both his skin and liver are normal. 

   THIS EPISODE, recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, marks another serendipitous incident in the strange history of methotrexate. 
In these days when genetic engineering and molecular manipulation turn up new wonder drugs almost weekly, methotrexate stands out as a baffling technological anomaly. 
In the 40 years since the drug was first synthesized, it has been alternately lauded as a treatment for a variety of human scourges and castigated as a poison whose risks are greater than the diseases it's being used to treat. 
Yet no one is quite sure how or why it does what it does. 

   The methotrexate story begins in the mid-1940s when the late Sidney Farber and his colleagues at Children's Hospital in Boston were attempting the first use of chemicals in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia, then an invariably fatal blood cancer. 

   The cancer researchers, according to an oft-told story, had noticed a similarity between the leukemia and a certain anemia which was due to a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid. 
This led them to treat the leukemia with folic acid. 
To their horror, the folic acid accelerated the leukemia instead of retarding it. 
This near-disaster, however, led them to try a second chemical, called aminopterin, that blocked the cancer cells' use of folic acid. 
In 1948, in an historic research paper, the Boston researchers reported the first remissions of acute leukemia through chemotherapy. 
Unfortunately, the remissions lasted only a few weeks or months. 

   The Boston discovery led chemists at Lederle Laboratories, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Cyanamid Co., to synthesize an improved version of aminopterin they called a-methopterin, to which Lederle's marketing people affixed the brand name, Methotrexate (the brand name has since slid into generic use). 

   METHOTREXATE PROVED even better at bringing about remissions of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and today it is one of the drugs achieving cures of leukemia in about 50% of afflicted children. 
By 1956, cancer researchers reported another first: Women developing an unusual cancer of the placenta during pregnancy had been permanently cured by methotrexate, the first cancer ever cured by chemotherapy. 

   In the early 1960s, serendipity struck again. 
A New York dermatologist reported instances of some patients being relieved of psoriasis, a chronic and severely disturbing skin disease, when treated with methotrexate. 
This led William O'Brien and Roger Black at the National Institutes of Health to run a controlled trial on 21 psoriasis patients. 
Not only did the skin disorder clear up in several patients but so did a type of arthritis that often accompanies psoriasis. 
The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most common form of the crippling disorder. 

   But, in treating psoriasis patients, the dangers of methotrexate became apparent. 
In high doses and daily use, the drug can cause severe liver damage and sometimes a lung disorder. 

   IN SOME CANCER PATIENTS, doctors have worked out a unique "rescue" concept, giving a patient dangerously high doses of methotrexate to kill cancer cells and then shortly afterward administering an antidote to save normal tissues from its poisonous effects. 

   Methotrexate's use in arthritis, at least for patients whose disease isn't helped by any other drug, is now being revived. 
Researchers have treated several hundred arthritis patients with low doses of methotrexate given only once a week. 
Anywhere from half to two-thirds of these patients improve; some have remissions of their arthritis. 
But while many arthritis specialists are using methotrexate in "refractory" patients, others shun it. 
One is Dr. O'Brien, who did the first trial of methotrexate in arthritis and who is now a professor at the University of Virginia. 
Because of its toxicity, he says, "we don't use it anymore here in Charlottesville." 

   Meanwhile, in Boston, Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues say they had a second patient with the same severe liver disease as the first but without the skin problem. 
"He was at his wits' end," Dr. Kaplan says. 
"I thought of that first patient and said, 'If you're a gambler and you want to try methotrexate, we'll do it.'" 
The patient's liver is now normal. 
A clinical trial of methotrexate in the liver disease, called primary sclerosis cholangitis, is now under way.

   New Study Adds Evidence Electric Wires
   May Boost Risk of Childhood Leukemia

   Preliminary results of a major new study have added
evidence that proximity to electric transmission wires may
increase the risk of childhood leukemia.
   Early findings by John Peters and associates at the
University of Southern California suggest that, among a
sample of 464 children in the Los Angeles area, those living
near certain clusterings of power lines and equipment were
about 2.5 times more likely to have leukemia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study, though still subject to scientific peer review,
appears to support growing evidence of ties between
electrical equipment and cancer risks.
   A recent Environmental Protection Agency report said that
electro-magnetic fields from electric power lines are a
possible -- if not proven -- cause of cancer. There have been
reports that electrical workers may be more at risk of brain
tumors and leukemia. And frequently-cited studies of Denver
residents found correlations between childhood cancer and
neighboring power lines.
   Dr. Peters's work "adds to the body of evidence" that some
still-unexplained process may be increasing the risk of
cancer, said George Hidy, who heads the environment division
of the Electric Power Research Institute, an
industry-financed group that paid for the study.
   The results of the University of Southern California study
had been widely awaited because of a large sample size --
some 232 children with leukemia and an equal number of
healthy children -- as well as detailed readings of
electrical and magnetic fields that were a part of the
research's design.
   But while the research appeared to offer important
affirmation that physical proximity to
electrical-transmission equipment may increase the risk of
leukemia, it didn't answer why. Its careful readings of
magnetic and electrical fields in houses where the children
lived didn't find that the more intense fields of bigger
power lines can be directly identified with increased
likelihood of cancer.
   This initial failure to tie magnetic fields to cancer is
perplexing."We are obviously missing something in this work,"
said Mr. Hidy. And, in that sense, the findings of the latest
study may focus future research, he said.
   The cancer risks uncovered were relatively low. The
overall frequency of childhood leukemia is about one case for
each 20,000 children, and an increase of 2.5 times in this
frequency implies 2.5 cases for each 20,000 youngsters.
   Results of the research were discussed yesterday at a
scientific conference in Carmel, Calif. Sketchy conclusions
were disclosed in both an "executive summary" written by Dr.
Peters and in material prepared by the Electric Power
Research Institute. However, Dr. Peters couldn't be reached
for comment and has indicated that he won't discuss results
of the study outside scientific circles until they have
received "peer review" by fellow scientists and been
published.
   In his executive summary, Dr. Peters noted "considerable"
evidence of a relationship between childrens' use of electric
appliances and the risk of leukemia. According to the
Electric Power Research Institute, the appliances found to
have strong correlations were hair-dryers and black-and-white
television sets.
   The industry research group questioned these particular
findings, saying that they depended on parents' memories of
appliance use and thus were less objective than other
elements of Dr. Peters's findings.
   The apparent lack of correlation between careful
measurements of magnetic-field strength and cancer could be
reversed with more statistical analysis. The study, begun in
1986 as an expansion of an existing work on various
potentially leukemia-related environmental factors, included
a wide range of factors such as household chemicals,
cigarette smoke and parent's occupations.
   But beyond more statistical analysis, the lack of a link
between magnetic-field strength and leukemia risk may stem
from a 24-hour, concentrated period in which magnetic
readings were made in houses. "Over a much longer term, it
may be that we will find the relationship," said Mr. Hidy.
   Less plausibly perhaps, the relationship between wires and
cancer could stem not from magnetic fields but some other
nonelectrical environmental threat.

   A mysterious paralyzing disease that occurs in
tropical climates may be caused by a virus that also triggers a
rare form of blood cancer, according to a report today.
   The virus, first isolated in 1980, is called human T-cell
lymphoma-leukemia virus Type 1, or HTLV-I. It causes cancer of a
variety of white blood cells known as T cells.
   Recently, doctors have found that people with a mysterious
disease called chronic progressive myelopathy, or tropical spastic
paraparesis, sometimes show signs in their blood of infection with
HTLV-I.
   In the latest study, doctors found direct evidence of the virus
in these people, strengthening the suspicion that HTLV-I can be one
cause of the disease.
   ``HTLV-I appears to be causally associated with many cases of
otherwise unexplained myelopathy in patients from the tropics,''
they wrote.
   The research was directed by Dr. Satyakam Bhagavati of the State
University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn. It was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Health experts say HTLV-I is spreading among drug addicts in the
United States. Surveys estimate that about two of every 10,000
units of blood used for transfusions contain the virus. Blood bank
officials have said they will start checking donations for the
virus when screening tests are available.
   Clusters of chronic progressive myelopathy occur in tropical
parts of the world, including the Caribbean, where the virus is
also relatively common. The disease results in weakness, numbness
and gradual paralysis of the legs.
   In their study, doctors found direct evidence of the virus in 12
patients who also had antibodies to HTLV-I.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Bruce J. Brew and Richard W.
Price of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York said
it's puzzling why the disease is rare even where the virus is
widespread.
   Even though there are other examples of low disease rates from
common viruses, they wrote, ``it nonetheless raises the question of
what other factors contribute to the development of the disease.''

the human blood system. The feat opens the door to curing diseases such as
leukemia, hemophilia and sickle cell anemia. It could also offer a means of

small Palo Alto-based biotechnology company, announced that its researchers

entire human blood system arises. These cells divide to produce all the basic
types of blood cells -- red cells that carry oxygen; white cells that fight

<TEXT>     Stem cells -- whose existence had only been inferred until now -- are
extremely rare in the bone marrow, and scientists believe a single stem cell
may have the ability to rebuild a person's entire immune system. Given that
extraordinary power, the search for the bone marrow stem cell has been called
the Holy Grail of blood research.;   If borne out by scientific data -- the
researchers may present their work next week -- the discovery means physicians
would soon be able to restore a patient's blood and immune systems when
damaged by radiation, chemotherapy or disease.;   Great potential; "This
finding is extremely exciting and important," said Dr. Samuel Broder, National
Cancer Institute director.;   Dr. R. Michael Blaese agreed. "This is
potentially very important for gene therapy for dozens of diseases," said the
NCI immunologist who last year became the first physician to use gene therapy
to treat patients -- two children suffering from a lethal immune system
disease known as adenisine deaminase deficiency.;   The discovery of the stem
cell also promises to be extremely controversial.;    It was not announced in
a scientific journal but by a for-profit company that kept quiet about its
work until it had obtained U.S. patents on the process of isolating the stem
cell and on the cell itself.;   Patenting of life forms -- genes, cells,
tissues, even animals -- is the heart of the burgeoning biotechnology
industry, but the idea still makes many uneasy.;   Ethical questions; By
patenting the bone marrow stem cell, Systemix "introduces us into a new era of
ethical problems in medicine," said Dr. Peter Quesenberry, vice president of
medical and scientific affairs of the Leukemia Society of America. "The idea .
. . you could have commercial restrictions on the use of such cells in
transplants would be very disturbing.";   Systemix plans clinical trials to
test bone marrow stem cell therapy in people early next year. The first
participants will be patients who have otherwise untreatable breast cancer,
leukemia and neuroblastoma, a form of brain cancer.  </TEXT>

   A new class of drugs that may aid in fighting cancer, AIDS and other diseases is moving onto biotechnology's center stage. 

   The experimental drugs are called blood-cell colony stimulating factors, or CSFs. 
In animal and early human tests, the drugs have boosted depressed numbers of infection-fighting white blood cells to normal and even above-normal levels. 

   "For the first time, we are able to regulate blood cells," says David Golde, a researcher at the University of California in Los Angeles. 
"That is a revolutionary thing." 

   CSFs aren't expected to cure cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
But they may help patients with such diseases fight off potentially fatal infections that take advantage of their weakened immune systems. 

   Scientists caution that the CSFs' benefits to patients haven't been established, and doing so may take years. 
But preliminary reports on the drugs, including one expected to appear soon in the New England Journal of Medicine, show they bolster certain kinds of white blood cells with remarkable consistency. 
That has created a groundswell of optimism among medical researchers, who hope the drugs will enable them to "dial up" blood-cell levels in patients as if they were turning up the volume on a radio. 

   Jerome Groopman, a researcher at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, says, "Preliminary trials indicate that the CSFs are the most exciting and promising" of biotechnology's immune-system modifiers, which include much-touted drugs like interferon and interleukin-2. 

   CSFs also are winning acclaim among analysts, who note that the drugs are aimed at well-defined markets. 
And compared with drugs like interferon, which have broad actions that are difficult to register, "CSFs have very direct effects that make it easy to devise clinical trials needed to get them approved" for marketing, says Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 

   Two of the new drugs are in clinical trials: GM-CSF, made by both Genetics Institute Inc. and Immunex Corp., which promotes infection-fighting cells called granulocytes and macrophages; and GCSF, made by Amgen Corp., which boosts granulocytes. 

   Scientists often mention a closely related substance, erythropoietin, or EPO, in the same breath with CSFs. 
EPO, made by both Amgen and Genetics Institute, boosts oxygen-carrying red blood cells and also has proved very promising in early clinical trials. 

   Scientists working with CSFs emphasize that the benefits of higher white-blood-cell counts induced by the drugs remain to be shown. 
But many researchers say they believe the drugs will help fight diseases, citing the well-established fact that patients with very low white-blood-cell counts are prone to infections. 
In fact, patients taking anti-cancer drugs -- which can almost knock out the immune system -- sometimes die of pneumonia and other infectious diseases rather than cancer. 

   Sadly, such patients often have cancers that might be arrested. 
Indeed, doctors are more willing to risk giving heavy doses of anti-cancer drugs to patients they might save than to those with untreatable tumors. 
If CSFs can prevent infections, physicians may be able to prescribe larger and more frequent chemotherapy doses -- perhaps extending cancer victims' lives by years. 

   Thus, CSFs may turn out to be potent weapons in the anti-cancer arsenal -- without having to pass muster in long, expensive anti-cancer tests. 
To get marketing approval for the drugs, "I think it will only be necessary to show reduced morbidity from infections rather than from cancer," says Jordan Gutterman, a cancer researcher testing GM-CSF at Houston's M.D. Anderson Hospital. 
A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration says it's too early to comment on possible standards to be applied to CSFs. 

   Scientists also are testing GM-CSF in AIDS patients. 
The AIDS virus mainly bludgeons immune cells that GM-CSF isn't expected to revive. 
But researchers hope that by revving up other immune cells with GM-CSF, they can ward off "opportunistic" infections in AIDS patients caused by bacteria, fungi and other microbes. 
The drug also may offset immune suppression caused by antibiotics and AZT, the only drug approved so far to treat AIDS. 

   According to early reports, CSFs cause only minor flu-like side effects, such as fever, chills and body aches. 
Ironically, three of 18 patients in an AIDS study reported in May developed signs of infection by a tuberculosis-like bacteria after taking GM-CSF. 
Boston's Dr. Groopman, who codirected the study, says the patients apparently had been harboring the bug without showing it. 
He explains that before they took GM-CSF their immune systems were too depressed to mount normal responses to the bacteria -- such as fever, a sign that the body is fighting back. 

   If CSFs are approved for marketing, their uses could expand rapidly -- especially if larger clinical trials support the conclusion that they have few side effects. 
The drugs might be used, for example, to push normal immune systems into overdrive as a preventive measure in frail, older patients hospitalized for broken bones. 
"A lot of people die of pneumonia," says Dr. Golde, the UCLA researcher, who is working with GM-CSF. 
"I would like to ask whether we could reduce that death rate." 

   Scientists' excitement about CSFs stems partly from the light they are shedding on the immune system, a complex system whose actions are controlled by messenger molecules such as CSFs. 
Last year, for example, Genetics Institute scientists identified a new member of the CSF family called interleukin-3, or IL-3, which apparently affects a broad range of cells and may amplify effects of other CSFs. 

   Moreover, researchers are finding that CSFs have other roles besides increasing blood-cell counts. 
"When granulocytes sense bacteria, they get very angry and dump out a toxic substance that's essentially like bleach," says Robert Kamen, Genetics Institute's senior vice president, scientific affairs. 
"Their ability to be angered is increased by GM-CSF, so with the drug, we can both increase granulocyte numbers and prime them for action." 

   And G-CSF may prove directly useful as a treatment for certain kinds of leukemia, or blood-cell cancers. 
In test-tube studies, the drug has converted leukemia cancer cells that are multiplying out of control into normal cells, says Philip Whitcome, Amgen's director of strategic planning. 

   Ultimately, researchers hope to use combinations of CSFs, perhaps with other immune-system hormones, to manipulate the immune system with even more power and precision. 
Immunex, for example, recently reported that CSFs appear to work synergistically with interleukin-1, another immune messenger, to boost white blood cells. 
Christopher Henney, Immunex's scientific director, says the company hopes the combination will help offset cancer patients' immune suppression from radiation treatments.

   Thirty-five million Americans report suffering
from arthritis and 6 million admit they haven't seen a doctor about
it, according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by the
Centers for Disease Control.
   ``People are seeing (pain-killer) ads on TV and treating their
arthritis themselves _ and very possibly doing damage to
themselves,'' said Steve Erickson, spokesman for the Arthritis
Foundation. The problem will probably get worse if pain relievers
are the only treatment, he said.
   Erickson said too few people are aware of the warning signs of
arthritis, such as joint swelling, early morning stiffness,
recurring joint pain or inability to move a joint that lasts for
more than two weeks.

   At least 14 deaths and 1,269 cases of a rare,
painful blood disorder known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have
been attributed to the health food supplement L-tryptophan, the
Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   The disorder, marked by an abnormally high number of white blood
cells, causes severe muscle pain and can cause death. The median
time between use of L-tryptophan and the onset of symptoms was 152
days.
   The FDA issued a recall request for L-tryptophan on Nov. 17 and
expanded it four days later to block importation of the product, a
protein component widely taken as a nutritional supplement.
   Last month, the FDA cautioned consumers against buying
L-tryptophan products from a California company that did not comply
with the recall request.

   Researchers using an intricate manipulation of
genes and transplantation of bone marrow have produced a mouse that
suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving scientists a
new way to test therapies against the killer disease.
   In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science,
researchers said they have discovered a way to give chronic
myelogenous leukemia, CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of
leukemia that usually attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   Lead researcher George Daley said the study also proves that CML
is initiated by the fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes, a
finding that had been suggested by earlier studies. Cells
containing the hybrid gene produce a protein that changes healthy
cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.

   A study of airline-cabin environment found
that, even with the smoking ban that takes effect in 10 days,
passengers and crew still face a health risk from increased
radiation from the sun and stars.
   The study released Thursday by the Transportation Department
recommends that airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will
reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who
regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher
altitudes.
   The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation
comparable to the risk of death from exposure to smoke-filled
cabins, although estimates of cancer caused by cosmic rays had a
wider range because of uncertainty over the effects of low doses of
radiation.
   It also recommended a total smoking ban but was superceded by
congressional action banning smoking on all flights of six hours or
less beginning Feb. 25.

   FDA Panel Urges Alpha Interferon
   Be Cleared for Hepatitis Treatment

   ROCKVILLE, Md. -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel recommended approval of alpha interferon to treat a
form of chronic viral hepatitis, or liver inflammation.
   A formal approval by the FDA, which is expected to follow
the panel's advice, would make interferon the first
specifically approved treatment for any form of viral
hepatitis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It would also clear the way for Schering-Plough Corp. to
market the biotechnology product for a form of the disease
which is formally known as chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.
About half a million Americans now suffer this form of liver
inflammation, which is spread by tainted blood transfusions,
unclean hypodermic needles and sexual contact. About 150,000
new cases are diagnosed each year, of which half progress to
a state of chronic infection. A virus responsible for about
85% of such cases was recently identified and dubbed
hepatitis C, making antibody testing possible.
   World-wide, the number of cases of the disease is
increasing and has assumed "epidemic" proportions in Japan,
according to Robert J. Spiegel, a Schering vice president of
clinical research.
   Chronic hepatitis sufferers, who are at increased risk of
death from cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer, would be
candidates for alpha interferon treatment under the panel's
recommendation.
   Schering, based in Kenilworth, N.J., said it was
"immensely pleased" by yesterday's action, which virtually
ensures a much broader market for interferon. The drug
previously has been approved for only a few small niches,
mostly in cancer treatment. The action also marks a major
milestone in the evolution of biotechnology industry, where
interferon held the rank of a pioneer, previously consigned
to play a bit part, but now stepping up to fill what may
become a major role.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Schering
closed at $48.875, up 37.5 cents.
   To win the panel's approval, Schering scientists presented
data on more than 300 patients, showing that liver
inflammation subsided in 53% of the patients treated with
alpha interferon, as opposed to 7% of untreated patients.
Conversely, 16% of the untreated control group worsened
during the study, compared with 2% of the treated group.
   "These are impressive data," said Jordan Gutterman, a
panel member and a pioneer interferon researcher at the
University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Side
effects consisted mostly of flu-like symptoms including
fatigue and nausea.
   To date, interferon has received approval for use in a
rare cancer known as hairy-cell leukemia, which affects about
2,500 people in the U.S., and in Kaposi's Sarcoma, an
AIDS-related malignancy with a roughly equal number of
patients, Schering said. The FDA has also approved its use in
treating genital warts.
   But analysts said FDA approval for chronic non-A, non-B
hepatitis would expand its potential market at least
five-fold. "We see this as adding another $100 million to
Schering's annual interferon sales," doubling last year's
level, said Michael Sorell, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in
New York. Looking ahead to continuing studies in other
cancers, not to mention in AIDS and hepatitis B, Dr. Sorell
predicted $300 million to $400 million in sales "looks
readily achievable" by 1993 to 1994. In the evolution of
biotechnology, Schering's Dr. Spielgel said, "Interferon is
an interesting story as the pioneering biotech product."
   It may also prove to be a classic case history of the new
biological agents which start small, and expand to fill
larger therapeutic roles as scientific knowledge about their
activity in the body and their potential use expands.
   Interferon was touted in the 1970s as a panacea, only to
prove disappointing and only narrowly useful at first. "A few
years ago, when interleukin-2 made the headlines, people
said: `Interferon -- so what?'" Dr. Spiegel said. "But it's
stood the test of time, and today's action puts us in a whole
new league."
   On Monday, an FDA panel withheld approval from
interleukin-2 as a treatment for kidney cancer, demanding
additional information from its maker, Cetus Corp. of
Emeryville, Calif.
   In a separate action, the FDA advisory panel recommended
that the agency grant Treatment IND (investigational new
drug) status to Immunex Corp.'s GM-CSF product. GHM-CSF is a
blood-cell growth factor that shows promise as a treatment
for bone marrow transplant failure in cancer patients and
those suffering certain kinds of anemia. However, the panel
asked Seattle-based Immunex for more study data before making
a formal recommendation to the FDA on market approval.
   Treatment IND status would make the drug more widely
available free of charge to patients during studies. About
5,000 patients receive bone marrow transplants each year.

<HEAD>Boy Beats Rare Leukemia With Umbilical Cord Blood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old with a rare form of
leukemia once considered incurable has apparently beaten the
disease after being given a transfusion of umbilical cord blood
from his baby sister, doctors say.
   Michael Sancilio of Virginia Beach left Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore on Saturday three months after becoming the first
leukemia patient to undergo the experimental transplant.
   ``Although doctors are reluctant to say Michael is cured,
Michael appears to have defeated a rare form of leukemia for which
previously existed no known cure,'' Virginia BEach General Hospital
said in a statement.
   Doctors there had collected so-called stem cells from his
sister's umbilical cord for transplant in Baltimore. Umbilical
blood, usually discarded at birth, is rich in stem cells, which
multiply rapidly to form bone marrow.
   Doctors gave Michael five tablespoons of the blood. Within one
month, he began producing healthy bone marrow, doctors said.
   ``What we are viewing this afternoon is nothing short of a
miracle,'' Dr. Leslie Wasserman Jr. said Sunday.
   ``God deserves all the credit,'' said Michael's grandmother,
Rachel Sancilio. ``I prayed for a miracle. It was the most
devastating thing. My heart goes out to any family that has to go
through something like this.''
   Umbilical cord blood transplants have been performed three other
times, once in Cincinnati and twice in France, to treat a different
disease, Fanconi's anemia.
   Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Eight months
ago, Michael was diagnosed with a form known as chronic myelogenous
leukemia, which cannot be controlled with drugs and usually kills
within a year of diagnosis.
   The boy's sister, Christina, was born May 1. Michael's blood
type did not match hers, but the siblings were otherwise
compatible, and doctors found that he was not overly likely to
reject the umbilical cord blood.
   Because of the procedure, Michael has ``another chance at life''
- and a new blood type, the hospital said.
   Doctors will not know for about two years whether the boy is
cured. Christina is healthy.

<HEAD>Early Look At Six-Year Fallout Study Reveals Nothing `Alarming'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An early look at a six-year study of the
health effects of radioactive fallout shows ``no strong evidence''
of a link between exposure and leukemia and thyroid disorders, the
project's director says.
   The $7 million study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is
intended to determine whether people living downwind of above-ground
atomic bomb tests in Nevada in the 1950s and 1960s suffered an
increased rate of cancer.
   Because all the data has not been tabulated, it is not possible
to say definitely ``there is or is not an effect,'' said Dr. Walter
Stevens, interim dean of the University of Utah Medical School and
director of the study.
   However, he said Thursday there is ``no strong evidence that
would convince me ... that there was a relationship'' between
fallout and disease.
   Stevens emphasized that epidemiological findings still are being
analyzed and that no final conclusions would be drawn until a draft
report had been reviewed by the National Cancer Institute.
   The draft likely will be delivered to NCI by mid-November and the
finished report released next March, he said.
   For years, people living in southwestern Utah, southeastern
Nevada and northeastern Arizona have feared that exposure to about
80 open-air tests at the Nevada Test Site had increased the
potential for leukemia and thyroid cancers.
   In 1979, Dr. Joseph L. Lyon, an University of Utah epidemiologist
who is working on the current study, published a paper showing a
2.4-fold increase in childhood leukemia in the areas of southern
Utah heavily dusted by fallout.
   Meanwhile, nearly 1,200 people living downwind of the tests sued
the federal government, claiming that exposure to fallout caused
sickness and death. In 1982, U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled
the government had failed to warn residents of radiation hazards.
   However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court concurred, saying the government
was immune from damages.
   The latest study was conducted in two parts _ one for leukemia
and the other for thyroid disorders _ and was designed as the most
comprehensive undertaking of its kind.
   Researchers located the names of 1,177 people from all over Utah
who had died of leukemia between 1952 and 1966 and selected as
controls another 5,600 people who had died of other causes.
   The subjects were matched where possible in age, residence,
health and lifestyle to ensure valid comparisons, Stevens said.
   In the thyroid study, 2,829 subjects in southern Utah,
southeastern Nevada and southern Arizona were identified as having
been exposed, and about 280 were found to have thyroid abnormalities.
   Scientists closely researched production distribution and
consumption of milk, thought to be one of the primary ways children
might have ingested radioactive materials from fallout.
   Stevens said the research has been greatly aided by the release
of previously classified information from the Department of Energy
on the amount of radiation emitted by the tests.
   Stevens said the study could prove to be a milestone in research
on the effects of exposure to radiation, with particular
significance to safety concerns at the nation's nuclear production
plants.

<TEXT>
   A new treatment is available for the estimated
8 million Americans who suffer each year from genital warts.
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has
OK'd direct injection of genetically engineered alpha interferon
into the warts.
   The FDA said a study of 192 patients showed they exhibited marked
improvement after receiving interferon injections three times a week
for up to three weeks.
   Of the 192, 42 percent experienced complete clearing of all their
treated warts, 24 percent had a 75 percent to 99 percent reduction
in the size of their treated warts and 18 percent had a 50 percent
to 74 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts, the FDA
said.
   Previously, the most effective treatments were painful and
potentially scarring removal by freezing or burning.
   Some types of genital warts can be treated with direct
application of conventional anti-infective drugs, but this treatment
often is not effective.
   Alpha interferon was first approved in June 1986 as a treatment
for hairy cell leukemia _ a rare form of leukemia.
   Although the presence of genital warts is more distressing than
health-threatening, some studies have suggested there could be a
relationship in women between the warts and later development of
cervical cancer.
   Adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials were mild
flu-like symptoms. The drug is not recommended for use in pregnant
women since animal studies have shown the treatment may cause
abortions.
   Schering Corp. of Kenilworth, N.J., will market the alpha
interferon treatment under the Intron-A brand name.

   A leukemia patient whose plight prompted 50,000
people to step forward as possible bone-marrow donors will undergo
a transplant of bone marrow from her mother Thursday, a hospital
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The operation on Allison Atlas, 20, is expected to take at least
four hours and could last six hours or more, said Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center spokeswoman Alice Burgess.
   Doctors are scheduled to extract the marrow from Miss Atlas'
mother at 9 a.m., the spokeswoman said.
   The marrow from her mother matches only four of six antigens, or
cell identifiers. But the New York University student from
Bethesda, Md., decided to undergo the operation while she is still
strong enough.
   She began chemotherapy July 31, and has responded well, Burgess
said.
   Doctors said a patient with Miss Atlas' type of leukemia can
expect a 60 percent chance of recovery if the transplant marrow is
perfectly matched. Without a transplant, they say the disease is
100 percent fatal.
   In leukemia, a form of cancer, white blood cells multiply
uncontrollably. Bone marrow produces blood, and doctors can combat
the cancer by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy tissue.
   Miss Atlas' condition prompted a campaign by her family last
fall to find a perfectly matched donor. They were unsuccessful, but
the effort raised $3 million to process blood samples from the
50,000 people in the United States and Israel who volunteered.
   Ten patients found perfect donors.

lower, but it doesn't say there is no risk," said Dr. Marilyn A. Fingerhut, an
epidemiologist who led the study.;    The cancer-causing potential of dioxin

Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C. But the study
points to the possibility of an effect on sperm, "and another study with
bigger numbers ought to look at it carefully," she said.;    In a separate
study, doctors found that children whose parents smoke are three to four times
as likely as other children to develop serious infectious diseases requiring
hospitalization.;    "I don't think anyone before has demonstrated that the
association is not just for mild illnesses but for really serious infections

supplying muscle cells with a functioning version of the gene. Duchenne
appears when people lack a functioning version.;    But creating the gene is
still "a long way from putting it into a patient," cautioned Louis Kunkel of

there.;  AIDS-TYPE FUNGUS HITS PEOPLE WITHOUT DISEASE;    A fungus that is the

<HEAD>Red Cross Survey Finds Potential New Threat In Donated Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross is ``right on target''
with plans to start testing donated blood for a rare virus linked
to a vicious form of adult leukemia, says the National Cancer
Institute researcher who first discovered the virus.
   Dr. Robert Gallo, a scientist credited with discovering the
human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, or HTLV-1, said the nation's
blood supply should be tested to protect future generations from
the slow-acting but dangerous virus.
   In a Science magazine report published today, Red Cross
scientist recommended that blood donated across the country should
be tested for the HTLV-1 virus as soon as a practical test be
developed. The recommendation was made after a Red Cross survey
found 10 units infected with the virus out of 39,898 units tested.
   ``I think there are as many people infected with this virus as
are infected with the AIDS virus,'' Gallo said.
   Alan E. Williams, a research scientist at the Red Cross
laboratory in Rockville, Md., said his research team estimates that
the risk of becoming infected with the HTLV-1 leukemia virus is
about 2,800 in 12 million, or about 1 chance in 4,286 for every
unit of blood transfused annually.
   ``The danger is minimal but not insignificant,'' Williams said.
   For that reason, he said, the Red Cross ``wants to take an
active stance to keep the situation from getting worse, as it
possibly could.''
   Williams said current methods of testing donated blood for the
virus take up to three days and a more practical test must be
developed before HTLV-1 screening can begin.
   He said at least three drug companies, which he declined to
name, are trying to develop screening tests, but these are months
from possible approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The NCI researcher discovered and identified the HTLV-1 virus in
1978. Gallo said his understanding of HTLV-1, a retrovirus that
takes over genetic control of cells it attacks, led him to look for
a retrovirus as the cause of AIDS. He is credited as co-discoverer
of the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
   Gallo said HTLV-1 may be rare in the continental United States,
but it is endemic in parts of Europe, Alaska, Africa and the Orient.
   ``In time, due to increased travel and increased sexual contact,
these kinds of virus are all increasing (in the continental
U.S.),'' said Gallo. Because HTLV-1 has a long latent period before
it causes disease, he said, ``it is not as readily seen as AIDS,
but our children and our children's children will see it if we
don't start eliminating it from the blood supply.''
   Gallo added, ``I'm very glad to see the way the Red Cross has
responded.''
   Dr. Edward Murphy, a National Cancer Institute researcher who
has studied the HTLV-1 virus extensively, said it is linked to
adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, a type of blood cancer usually
fatal within six months.
   Another disease closely linked to the virus, said Murphy, is
tropical spastic paraparesis, in which the virus attacks nerve
cells that control the lower extremities and causes paralysis and
eventually death.
   The incubation period for expression of the leukemia is thought
to be 30 years or more, but people exposed to the virus become
infectious within two weeks to six months, said Murphy. Incubation
for paraparesis is slightly shorter.
   The virus can be spread in ways similar to the AIDS virus: by
sexual contact or the exchange of body fluids such as by sharing
drug needles. HTLV-1 also is thought to be spread through mother's
milk, said Murphy.
   Williams said the Red Cross survey checked for HTLV-1 in samples
from eight different blood banks. Blood donors who tested positive
for the virus were found in Atlanta, Washington, Birmingham, Ala.
and Los Angeles.
   Blood also was tested in St. Paul, Minn., Portland, Ore.,
Baltimore and Miami, but no HTLV-1 was found.
   Though the positive tests totaled only 10 out of more than
39,000 samples tested, Williams said, ``a highly selective group''
was used. ``They go through several levels (of screening) before
the blood is ever drawn,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hair Loss From Chemotherapy May be Prevented, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First a patient hears the cancer diagnosis and
then learns that the needed chemotherapy may cause temporary
baldness. For many, the loss of hair is a huge cosmetic burden
piled on the already terrible physical trauma of disease.
   But help may be on the way, according to a study published today
in the journal Science.
   Dr. A.A. Yunis, of the University of Miami Jackson Memorial
Hospital Medical Center, reports that he and his colleagues have
discovered ``by chance'' that an experimental cancer drug blocks
hair loss in laboratory rats injected with some chemotherapy
agents.
   If the finding can be translated into drugs to treat humans, an
expert said, ``it would be of tremendous benefit'' to cancer
patients who now must endure the characteristic mark of
chemotherapy baldness.
   Yunis said his team made the discovery while testing
cancer-fighting drugs on lab rats that had been injected with
leukemia cells.
   Half of the rats were treated with a drug called cytosine
arabinoside, or ARA-C. The rest were treated with a combination of
ARA-C and an experimental drug called ImuVert.
   ``We found, lo and behold, that the rats with ARA-C only became
nude. They lost all their hair,'' said Yunis. ``The ones with both
ARA-C and ImuVert, however, did not lose hair at all.''
   Yunis said his group then tested ImuVert with another common
cancer drug, doxorubicin, or DX. He said they found that rats with
the DX-ImuVert combination also experienced no hair loss, while
rats receiving only the DX lost hair on their heads and shoulders.
   ImuVert combined with a third cancer drug, cyclophosphamide,
however, did not prevent hair loss in the rats, said Yunis.
   Dr. Ed Gelmann, chief of the department of medical oncology at
Georgetown University in Washington, said that if a way can be
found to prevent hair loss ``patients will feel much better about
chemotherapy.''
   Chemotherapy baldness is nearly always temporary. The hair
usually grows back after the treatment cycle.
   Nonetheless, said Gelmann: ``A lot of patients focus on hair
loss because it is so apparent. It can be quite a stigma. It would
be a tremendous benefit to eliminate hair loss as long as it did
not change the efficacy of the cancer chemotherapy.''
   Yunis said that ImuVert appears to help combat leukemia while it
is preventing chemotherapy baldness. He said the drug teamed with
ARA-C halted the progression of leukemia in all but 20 percent of
the laboratory rats tested. This result was better than among rats
treated with ARA-C alone, he said.
   Dr. Gregory Curt, director of the clinical oncology department
at the National Cancer Institute, said controlling hair loss during
chemotherapy ``is a very serious thing for patients.''
   ``The two things that concern patients the most about
chemotherapy are nausea and that some people can get bald,'' he
said. There are drugs to control the nausea, but there is no pill
to block the hair loss.
   ``For both men and women, it is one of the side effects that
concerns people the most because it changes one's body image,''
said Curt.
   The physician said he remembers at least two patients who were
so concerned about the loss of hair that they actually refused
lifesaving chemotherapy.
   ImuVert now is being tested as a chemotherapy agent against
brain cancer. Yunis said it could be several years before it is
approved for use on patients.
   He said the discovery also gives researchers a clue that may
help find even more effective drugs to block hair loss among
chemotherapy patients.
   He said ImuVert is a drug known as a biological response
modifier because it alters the way some cells in the immune system
act. If the precise effect of this drug on the hair follicles could
be identified, then new drugs with this action could be developed,
said Yunis.
   Science, which today published the University of Miami research
report, is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Coauthors of the paper with Yunis are Atif M. Hussein and
Joaquin J. Jimenez of the University of Miami, and Catherine A.
McCall of Cell Technology Inc.

<TEXT>
   Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, who blazed a new path for
the treatment of leukemia when he performed the first human bone
marrow transplant in 1956, said today he always considered the
Nobel Prize ``a long shot at best.''
   Thomas, 70, of Bellevue, Wash., and Joseph E. Murray, 71, were
awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine today, officials in Stockhom,
Sweden announced.
   Murray, affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,
was recognized for his discovery of a method to prevent tissue
rejection when organs are transplanted in people.
   Thomas, with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, said he learned of the good news when awakened by a
reporter's telephone call early this morning.
   ``I really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the
prize,'' Thomas said. ``There are many scientist-researchers out
there who are eligible for this prize.
   ``It's a long shot at best, and it would be a mistake to waste
time thinking about winning it.''
   The prize shared by Murray and Thomas, worth $695,000, is
endowed by the will of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in
1896.
   Thomas said he hasn't had time yet to think of what he will do
with the money.
   Thomas, who took after his father and fulfilled his childhood
desire to become a doctor, performed the first human bone marrow
transplant in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1956.
   The surgical procedure has become standard treatment for many
sufferers of leukemia and lymphoma, which are types of cancer.
   Thomas joined the University of Washington faculty in 1963 and
went to the Hutchinson center when it opened in 1975. The center is
now one of the world'sleading cancer treatment and research
institutions.
   ``I think it's a recognition of a lot of work by a lot of people
who have worked on the problems over the years. I have a medical
team here of some 50 physicians and Ph.D.s who now work with me on
this. It's been very gratifying to see the procedure become
accepted as the primary form of treatment for leukemia,'' Thomas
said.
   In a bone marrow transplant, the patient's diseased marrow is
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. Disease-free marrow is
removed by needle from the hip bone of a donor, often a relative,
and dripped intravenously into the patient. In time, the
transplanted cells begin to grow in the patient's marrow and
produce new white and red blood cells and platelets.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing
wider distribution of a leukemia drug that has been shown effective
in patients who aren't helped by other treatments, an FDA spokesman
said Tuesday.
   The drug, fludarabine phosphate, is being used to treat patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is the most common form of
adult leukemia.
   The drug is believed to slow or interrupt reproduction of
abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow,
blood and liver of people with the disease.
   The FDA has approved wider distribution of the drug under a
``treatment IND,'' which is shorthand for treatment use of an
investigational new drug, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   A treatment IND allows patients with serious or immediately
life-threatening diseases to get an experimental drug while
controlled testing in human clinical trials continues.
   The drug was developed by Triton Biosciences Inc., a Shell Oil
Co. subsidiary based in Alameda, Calif. and clinical trials are
being conducted by National Cancer Institute. Triton plans to
market the drug under the trade name Fludara I.V.

<HEAD>4-Year-Old Gets Sister's Umbilical Cord Blood to Fight Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a medical first, five tablespoons of
umbilical cord blood saved after the birth of a baby were given to
her 4-year-old brother in hopes it will help him form new bone
marrow and beat fast-acting leukemia.
   Michael Sancilio received the transfusion at Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center on Monday.
   His 3-month-old sister, Christina, is too young to donate bone
marrow, the usual treatment for Michael's form of leukemia, and
doctors were afraid he wouldn't survive the three-month wait before
his sister became old enough.
   ``We didn't have any other choice,'' said the youngsters'
mother, Denise Sancilio. ``We couldn't put our baby through a bone
marrow aspiration. It's very dangerous for her. We were in a
situation where we had to do it.''
   It was the first time the rare operation was undertaken to treat
leukemia, an often fatal blood cancer. It has been performed three
other times, once in Cincinnati and twice in France, to treat a
different disease, Fanconi's anemia.
   Umbilical cord blood is rich in stem cells, used by the
recipient to form marrow. Doctors said they will know in about
three weeks whether the operation worked.
   Michael, who has juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia, is at
extreme risk of infection in the meantime because his cancerous
bone marrow had to be destroyed as part of the treatment. Marrow is
critical to the immune system.
   ``He's been on and off sleeping all day,'' Michael's father,
Tony, said Monday night. ``This afternoon he got up and walked down
the hall and to the children's playroom. He's up and alert. A
little groggy but holding his own.''
   Mrs. Sancilio said she was 7{ months pregnant with Christina
when she learned Michael had a form of leukemia that cannot be
controlled with drugs and usually kills within a year of diagnosis.
   The umbilical cord blood was frozen when Christina was born May
1. A total of 2.7 ounces were given to Michael after chemotherapy
to destroy his cancerous marrow.
   The transplant carries the same risk as a bone-marrow
transplant. Besides the risk of infection, the body often rejects
foreign cells.
   Michael's blood type does not match his sister's, but doctors
found that he was not overly likely to reject the umbilical cord
blood.
   Tests on Michael's parents and his 7-year-old brother, also
named Tony, showed they were not compatible marrow donors. The
family lives in Virginia Beach, Va.
   ``The odds were we thought he had the chance of surviving for a
couple of months, but it was unknown when the disease would
accelerate and become life-threatening,'' said Dr. John Wagner.
``We decided to go ahead and take the chance on the cord blood
rather than waiting until the donor was old enough.''
   If the transfusion works, it could lead to creation of a bank of
umbilical cord blood to aid similarly afflicted youngsters, doctors
said.
   The transfusion can be performed only on young children because
not enough blood is in the umbilical cord for use with adults, said
Dr. Richard Champlin, chief of the bone-marrow transplant program
at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
   ``In the long run it could provide the potential to protect and
store umbilical blood from every baby and create a bank of cells
for transplantation that could be used if a patient didn't have a
donor within the family,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  Workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who were exposed to
very low levels of nuclear radiation for many years had a leukemia death rate
63 percent higher than the general population, according to a study to be
published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.;    The
study appears to be the first to indicate that long-term exposure to radiation
levels well below permissible levels -- and below the average exposure for
workers at commercial nuclear-power plants -- could result in an increased
risk of leukemia. It also suggests that the longer a group of workers is
monitored, the higher the leukemia rate will be, because the disease takes
years to develop.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HIGH LEUKEMIA RATE FOUND AMONG WORKERS AT

<TEXT>     "I think it's disturbing," said Steve Wing, a University of North Carolina
epidemiologist who was the principal author of the study. "We have seen an
association between cancer mortality and radiation doses at a very low level.
. . . Many people have assumed that there is no safe level of exposure, but it
has been assumed that the chances of finding an effect of exposures at this
level would be like a few drops of water in a swimming pool, not enough to be
measurable. Now we see it looks like it's not just a few drops, and that's
disturbing.";    The report does not say there is a cause-and-effect
relationship between the low-exposure levels and the increased leukemia rate.
Nor does it suggest that there is any danger to residents of communities
surrounding nuclear facilities. On the contrary, a previously publicized
study, published in the same issue, says "deaths due to leukemia or other
cancers" in 107 counties where such facilities are located were not more
frequent than elsewhere.;    Wing and his colleagues examined the records of
8,318 white men who worked at Oak Ridge from 1943 to 1972. Because they came
from a generally well-educated and prosperous segment of the population, the
researchers said, the workers had lower-than-expected death rates from all
causes, including cancers other than leukemia.;    But of the 1,524 who are
known to have died, 28 died of leukemia, and two others had leukemia among
other illnesses, a rate "63 percent higher than expected," the researchers
found.;    Wing's study was financed by the Energy Department, which operates
Oak Ridge, as part of a long-term study begun in 1943 of the effects on
workers and nearby residents of the nuclear weapons manufacturing operations.;
   Assistant Energy Secretary Paul Ziemer, a former health physicist at Oak
Ridge, said Wing's report was "clearly a real finding," but he said it would
be premature to decrease the permissible-exposure standard on that basis
alone.;    International agencies that set exposure limits are constantly
re-evaluating available data and will consider Wing's findings among others in
deciding whether to recommend that limits be tightened, Ziemer said.  </TEXT>

   A college student with leukemia whose search for
a compatible bone-marrow donor drew celebrity support and 50,000
volunteers underwent a last-ditch transplant using her mother's
marrow.
   Allison Atlas, 20, opted for the surgery Thursday although her
mother's tissue is not a perfect match. She said she wanted to try
the life-saving procedure while she was still relatively strong.
   Her condition today at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
was withheld at the family's request, said hospital spokeswoman
Alice Burgess. The transplant team was headed Dr. Edward Agura.
   The marrow from her 54-year-old mother, Arline Atlas, matched
only four of six antigens, or cell identifiers, from her daughter's
marrow. The operation could work if Miss Atlas' body does not
reject her mother's tissue.
   ``They're both fighters,'' said Sy Atlas, a cousin. ``They're
both people who are determined to beat the odds. Arline was excited
to be the donor for her daughter.''
   Miss Atlas, a student at New York University when she became ill
last year, heightened awareness of the need for bone-marrow donors
with a publicity campaign that drew 50,000 volunteers in the United
States and Israel.
   Supporters raised $3 million, including a six-figure check from
actor Dustin Hoffman, to process the 50,000 blood tests. No match
was found for Miss Atlas, but 10 other leukemia patients were
matched with donors.
   Bone marrow provides necessary components of the human immune
system, and transplant patients are at high risk of infection for
three weeks after the operation until the new marrow begins to work.
   Miss Atlas, of Bethesda, Md., will recuperate in a sterile
environment at the cancer center, where more than 3,000 bone-marrow
transplants have been performed, more than any other clinic.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, a leukemia-stricken Soviet helicopter pilot
who flew firefighting missions over the damaged Chernobyl nuclear
reactor, underwent a bone marrow transplant at the center earlier
this year.
   He died July 3 of complications of a lung infection that took
hold during the period when he had no natural defenses.
   In leukemia, a form of blood cancer, white blood cells multiply
out of control. Since bone marrow produces blood, doctors can
combat leukemia by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy
tissue.
   Before the operation, Miss Atlas reassured her mother with humor
and encouraged family members.
   ``She was really cool,'' Sy Atlas said in a TV interview from
Washington, D.C. ``Last night, talking with her mom, she jokingly
said ... `Mom, your marrow better be good for me tomorrow.'''
   ``She's really positive. With that kind of attitude, we're
confident she's going to do well.''

<HEAD>Tentative Link Found Between New Herpes Virus, Cancer, Biologist
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biologist said Wednesday that a newly
discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth
cancer-causing virus and appears to work with the AIDS virus in
wiping out the immune system of AIDS victims.
   Robert Gallo, the National Cancer Institute's chief of
tumor-cell biology, said more evidence was needed before the highly
contagious Herpes 6, or human B-lymphocyte virus, could be blamed
for causing certain types of cancers.
   Gallo spoke at the annual meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, which convened here Sunday.
   Researchers have found a high prevalence of antibodies to the
Herpes 6 virus in people with Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia,
Gallo said.
   ``One could argue the virus must be playing a role to be
detected so readily in those tumors,'' Gallo said.
   Currently, five other viruses are believed to cause cancer. They
are hepatitis B, which can cause liver cancer; Epstein-Barr, which
can cause nasopharyngeal cancer; HTLV, which can cause leukemia;
papillomavirus, which may cause cervical cancer; and
cytomegalovirus, linked to prostate cancer.
   The Herpes 6 virus also has been found alongside the AIDS virus
in T-4 cells, which mastermind the immune system and are the prime
target of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Gallo said.
   Since the AIDS virus kills only a small percentage of T-4 cells
at a time, Gallo said, the new herpes virus might explain the total
annihilation of T-4 cells in AIDS patients.
   Tests to detect Herpes 6 have differed widely on its prevalence
in the United States. One test indicated that it is carried by
between 5 percent and 30 percent of the population; another
indicated between 70 percent and 90 percent.

<HEAD>Government Report Links Leukemia To Nuclear Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of leukemia among young people living
near a nuclear complex in a barren area of northern Scotland is
nearly twice Britain's national rate, a report published today says.
   The report by the government-sponsored Committee on Medical
Aspects of Radiation in the Environment says six known cases of
leukemia were diagnosed among young people under 24 who lived
within 15 miles of the plant in Dounreay between 1968 and 1984.
   ``This is twice the number expected on the basis of the national
rate,'' the report says, adding that the likelihood of such a high
rate occurring by chance is about one in 12.
   Five of the victims lived within 7.8 miles of the nuclear
complex, the center for Britain's fast-breeder reactor research
program, the study says.
   The report says the reason for the number of leukemia cases is
not known, though the findings echo a 1986 government investigation
showing the childhood leukemia rate near the Sellafield nuclear
reprocessing plant in Cumbria, northwest England, to be four times
the national average.
   ``It is hard to imagine that you could see an excess around
Dounreay and an excess around Sellafield, and it is just bad
luck,'' said commission chairman Martin Bobrow.
   The committee said it was ``conceivable that minute amounts of
radioactive material carried home may accumulate and lead to
exposure of infants in some unforeseen way.''
   But it said the level of leukemia might also be due to exposure
to chemicals, viruses or even chance.
   Scottish Health Minister Michael Forsyth said the government had
accepted the committee's recommendation to hold an investigation
into the high rates, despite the``small number of cases involved.''
   However, union spokesman Bryan Durrans of the Institute of
Professional Civil Servants called the report ``inconclusive.''
   ``If most of us thought anything was likely to happen to our
children or families, we would not be here.'' he said.
   The Dounreay complex employs 2,100 workers in a barren area of
Northern Scotland that offers little alternative employment.
   The environmental group Friends of the Earth lauded the report
as the first government admission of a link between leukemia and
nuclear emissions, and called for an immediate closure of both the
Dounreay and Sellafield plants.
   ``The nuclear industry has finally been implicated in causing
cancers _ something it has denied for years,'' said spokesman
Stewart Boyle.
   Leukemia clusters _ occurrences of the disease statistically
higher than normal _ have also been found in southern England near
the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, the Royal Ordnance
Factory and the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority.
   In each case, scientists in the nuclear industry argued that
recorded emissions of radiation were not high enough to account for
higher rates of the radiation-linked disease.
   The national leukemia rate is eight cases per 100,000 people.

<LEADPARA>  Children living near high-voltage power lines could have more than twice the
usual risk of getting leukemia, although the risk remains low, according to
preliminary data compiled by a Los Angeles researcher.;    His findings appear
to support previous studies that have led to a furor over the risks of
electromagnetic fields. But the study also adds to the puzzle, because it
found that the actual levels of electrical and magnetic fields found in a home
seem unrelated to the children's health.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Frequent use of hair dryers and black-and-white televisions also slightly
increased the risk of leukemia, although the exact increase was not released.;
   Dr. John Peters, director of USC's occupational health division at the
University of Southern California, presented his findings Thursday at a closed
scientific meeting in Carmel.;    Peters said, through a spokesman, that he
would not release his data or discuss his findings in public until they have
been reviewed and accepted for publication in a scientific journal. But in a
departure from usual scientific procedure, summaries of his findings were
distributed by the Electric Power Research Institute, the Palo Alto-based
industry group that financed his study and sponsored the Carmel meeting.;   
The institute acted on its own because it assumed that word of the results
would leak out anyway, and it wanted to provide as thorough a report as
possible, a spokeswoman said.;    Electromagnetic fields are routinely
produced when electrical current passes through a wire or household
appliance.;    In the past decade, several inconclusive studies have suggested
that children living near high-voltage lines have a higher-than-normal chance
of developing leukemia.;    No one has proved that the power lines are causing
cancer, or even how they might. But the Environmental Protection Agency, in a
recent draft report, concluded that there was enough evidence of a possible
link to warrant new research.;    In the USC study, which began in 1986,
Peters examined the lives of 464 children under the age of 10. Half had
leukemia and half did not. Each leukemia patient was compared to a healthy
child of the same age, sex, race and geographic area.;    Parents were
interviewed by telephone about occupation, household use of chemicals,
smoking, drug use and daily activities, including exposure to electrical
appliances.;    Unlike those who conducted earlier studies, Peters' group
entered homes and took direct measurements of the electric and magnetic
fields. A recording device was placed in each child's bedroom to measure such
fields every minute for 24 hours.;    Power lines in the neighborhood were
examined, as well as the thickness of the wires and their distance from the
houses.;    Like previous researchers, Peters found an association between
neighborhood power lines and the risk for childhood leukemia. The normal risk
of childhood leukemia is 1 in 20,000 a year, the institute said, and the
children with the greatest exposure to the most powerful transmission lines
had a risk of 2.5 in 20,000.;    But oddly, there was little or no association
between leukemia and measures of exposure to electric or magnetic fields.;   
In fact, children in homes with moderate magnetic field exposures had a lower
cancer risk than children in homes with the least exposures.;    The study
also found other factors associated with leukemia risk: parents' use of
incense, pesticides inside the house and men's use of spray paint at work
during their wives' pregnancies.  </TEXT>

   A leukemia patient received her mother's bone
marrow Thursday, after doctors failed to find a perfect match among
50,000 people who volunteered as donors.
   Allison Atlas, 20, had the transplant at Fred Hutchison Cancer
Research Center in Seattle. Her mother, Arline, 54, was the donor.
   The plight of Miss Atlas, a New York University student from
Bethesda, Md., prompted 50,000 people to volunteer for bone marrow
tests. There was no perfect match for Miss Atlas, but 10 other
leukemia patients got donors.
   Mrs. Atlas' marrow matched four of six antigens, or cell
identifiers, from her daughter's marrow.
   Doctors said Miss Atlas would have had a 60 percent chance of
recovery if the donated marrow was a perfect match. Her chances are
reduced ``somewhat'' but other patients with the same degree of
mismatch have recovered, said hospital spokeswoman Alice Burgess
said.
   Without the transplant, she would live less than a year, Burgess
said.
   Leukemia causes white blood cells to multiply uncontrollably.
Bone marrow produces blood, and doctors combat the cancer by
replacing the diseased marrow.
   The Atlas family's public campaign last fall raised $3 million
to process blood samples from the 50,000 people in the United
States and Israel who registered with the National Marrow Donor
Program.
