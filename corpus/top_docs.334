   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. unveiled a
printer and printer software, the latest weapons in its
battle to crack markets traditionally served by personal
computers.
   Sun's new software, a $495 program called NeWSprint,
breaks ground for Sun, because it allows the company's
workstations to use a much broader range of printers than
before, including inexpensive dot-matrix machines and
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s popular ink-jet printers. Until now,
Sun workstations could "talk" only to printers with
sophisticated processing abilities built in.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The software is part of Sun's two-year strategy of
increasing its share of markets, such as corporate offices,
that mainly use personal computers tied into networks. Sun
has cut prices of some of its machines to less than $5,000,
bringing them to PC price ranges, and has persuaded software
houses, such as Lotus Development Corp., to adapt their PC
software to Sun's workstations.
   But without a printer-software package such as NeWSprint,
which includes fonts, or print typefaces, that are compatible
with Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript, Sun's machines couldn't
easily be integrated into many personal-computer networks.
"As far as driving revenue and profit, it's not meaningful,"
Cliff Friedman, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said. "But
as far as their two-year goal, it's critical."
   The new software is unique, because it places the
"intelligence" necessary for printing -- the processing of
typefaces and graphics, for example -- in the computer,
rather than in the printer. In a conventional scheme, the
laser printer contains the intelligence, which tends to slow
down the printing process.
   Sun's new Sparcprinter, priced at $2,695, prints twice as
fast as Sun's older, $6,400 LaserWriter. Analysts said that
the printer isn't a threat to more entrenched laser printer
makers, such as Hewlett-Packard, but that it will help Sun
dealers offer more attractively priced computer packages.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares
closed at $27.75, up 50 cents, on volume of more than 1.4
million shares.

   Sun Introduces
   Its PC-Priced
   Workstation

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced
a computer workstation priced at $4,995, setting a new
standard for high-powered desktop computing at relatively low
prices.
   Sun's new computer, called the Sparcstation SLC, is likely
to cement Sun's lead in the workstation market, one of the
fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. While
Sun's chief competitors in workstations, Hewlett-Packard Inc.
and Digital Equipment Corp., vow to introduce similarly
priced but more powerful workstations, some analysts think
Sun's new machine will confound competitors for many months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This makes it difficult for DEC and HP to keep up with
Sun in the workstation business," said Vicki Brown, an
analysts at International Data Corp.
   Sun declined to estimate future sales of the machine,
though it said it had already received orders for 5,000
units.
   However, Ms. Brown said Sun's newest computer is expected
to lift sales of its year-old Sparcstation family
significantly. She said sales of all three models, including
the SLC, will probably total 95,000 units this year, roughly
three times last year's sales.
   Besides helping Sun satisfy its traditional engineering
and scientific customers, the new machine will add momentum
to the company's assault on the market for personal
computers, generally used by white collar workers.
   "The battle today is on the desktop," said Scott McNealy,
Sun's chief executive officer, referring to the company's
plans to butt heads with such PC makers as Apple Computer
Inc.
   While Sun may steal some PC sales, the new SLC lacks a
hard-disk drive, the basic storage device for PCs, and it
can't be upgraded with accessories that improve performance.
   But the machine operates at blazing speeds -- 12.5 million
operations a second -- because it has at its heart Sun's own
Sparc microprocessor. The extra speed is useful in, for
instance, financial modeling or electronic publishing, where
PCs often lack the horsepower to carry out complex tasks.
   Sun is expected to introduce an even faster Sparcstation
before the end of the year, putting further pressure on
competitors. That machine might even share the same packaging
as the SLC, which is designed so that its circuitry shares
the same housing as its 17-inch monitor.
   The packaging is crucial to Sun's profit margins on the
computer, which may sell for as little as $3,000 when
purchased in large quantities. Ms. Brown said Sun spent $1
million on tooling for the computer and managed to design the
machine without a fan, which reduces the computer's noise and
manufacturing costs.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares
closed at $29.25 apiece, down $1.25 on heavy volume of about
1.9 million shares.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., attempting
to fill a gaping hole in its product line, said it plans to
unveil today a new line of high-speed "multiprocessing"
servers, computers that use more than one processor.
   Sun is aiming its new line, the Sparcserver 600MP, at
users in big corporations, where servers are often used to
connect desktop computers into networks and central data
bases. The 600MP, with list prices ranging from $45,000 to
just over $105,000, will go up against machines from
formidable incumbents such as International Business Machines
Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sun has the world's biggest market share in the
workstation computers that are often used by engineers, but
it has lagged in the market for high-end servers that
businesses are increasingly using to replace old-line
mainframe and mini-computers. Sun's servers were seen as too
slow and lacked the sophisticated software needed to direct
the complex tasks that such machines are asked to do.
   "On the server side we've been pretty primitive," said
Lawrence Hambly, vice president of marketing of Sun's
computer unit. "This is the first really major announcement
of servers that really are worth calling servers."
   The new servers come in versions with two and four central
processors, the "brains" of the machines, and run typical
business software at around 140 transactions per second, a
common measure of computing speed. That's nearly three times
as fast as Sun's previous, similarly priced, server models,
Mr. Hambly said.
   Analysts said Sun's new servers are likely to be a hit
with existing Sun users, but they are more skeptical of Sun's
ability to succeed outside its own camp. The machines "will
be a home run for Sun in its own native market but they're 18
months late," said Douglas Crook, an analyst at Dataquest
Inc., a market-research firm.
   Companies such as Solbourne Computer Inc. of Longmont,
Colo., have sold multiprocessing machines since 1989. And
Sun, facing an increasingly crowded market for servers in
corporate computer rooms, isn't likely to make big headway in
business applications such as data base servers and online
transaction processing, Mr. Crook said. "They've got
competitors with faster boxes and better technology who've
been there longer," he said.
   Sun also will announce a multiprocessing version of its
Unix operating system, Sun's Mr. Hambly said. Sun will offer
devices allowing users of existing Sun server models to
convert their machines to multiprocessing machines while
keeping the older computers outer package and disk drives, he
said.

   Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to unveil today a range of
speedier new computers that defend Sun's position as the
leader in low-cost workstations.
   Separately, Hewlett-Packard Co. says it has sped up its
own workstations. And Silicon Graphics Inc. plans to announce
today a low-cost "multimedia" computer that processes
high-quality music and video along with fast
three-dimensional graphics now available only in expensive
workstations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While Sun's new workstations are vital to maintain its
position as the highest-volume workstation vendor, analysts
said, the machines don't provide the high-performance machine
they feel Sun needs to compete with offerings from
International Business Machines Corp. and H-P.
   "It's a ho-hum announcement," said Nancy Battey, a
research director at International Data Corp., a
market-research firm. "It continues Sun's leadership in
low-cost. But what they're still lacking is leading-edge
computer performance."
   Sun officials said its new machines are "enhanced"
versions of existing products. One of the machines, the
Sparcstation ELC, listing for $4,995, is 50% faster and has
four times the memory of its predecessor, the $6,995
Sparcstation IPC. Another, the Sparcstation IPX, will be
similar to the Sun's existing Sparcstation 2 but will list at
$11,995, or 25% less than the older machine.
   With its low-cost workstations, Sun has aggressively gone
after the large pool of users who typically buy personal
computers for business and technical computing tasks. The
Mountain View, Calif., company's inexpensive machines have
helped it build its No. 1 share of the workstation market.
Sun plans to entice more low-end computer users through a
trade-in program, whereby users can get a $1,000 discount on
its IPC color workstation by trading in competitors'
workstations or highend PCs.
   Sun is also a leader in introducing workstations that
employ reduced-instruction-set computing, or Risc, a set of
technologies that computer makers are using increasingly to
squeeze more speed out of their computers. But Sun has lagged
in pushing its Risc machines to run faster, allowing IBM and
H-P to surpass it in the performance race.
   Sun's new IPX, for example, runs at 24.2 "SPECmarks," a
widely used measure of a computer's speed in doing typical
tasks. H-P last March began selling a Risc machine that, at
about the same base price as Sun's, runs at a faster 55.5
SPECmarks; IBM's similarly priced RS/6000 Risc workstation
clocks in 32.5 SPECmarks.
   Moreover, H-P and IBM are juicing up their machines. H-P
said it will announce today it has begun shipping new
software that increases by about 7% the speed of its Series
700 Risc workstations. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., said it will begin
shipping software in September that will speed up its Risc
machines 27%.
   Sun's "announcement does absolutely nothing to close the
performance gap," said Robert Weinberger,
workstation-marketing manager for H-P, Palo Alto, Calif.
   Sun also will face assaults on its own stronghold this
fall, when H-P, IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard,
Mass., are expected to begin selling Risc machines for around
$5,000. On one hand, Sun's new workstations will help it sell
47% more machines in 1991 than in 1990, estimates Ms. Battey
of International Data. But rivals' low-cost machines this
fall will be Sun's "first true competition," she says. "That
could stall the growth."
   Separately, Silicon Graphics said it will unveil a machine
it calls a "Risc personal computer," essentially a low-cost
version of the Mountain View, Calif., company's workstations
with multimedia technology added. The machine, dubbed IRIS
Indigo, lists from $7,995 and can provide fancy, fast-moving
3-D images that, until now, only came from machines costing
several times that much.
   The machine can process and play music matching the
quality coming from digital-audio-tape players used by audio
buffs today, the company said. Along with other computer
makers, Silicon Graphics is aiming at what many expect to
become a booming market among business, schools and
laboratories for multimedia computers.

   Sun Microsystems Inc. is slated to introduce today a new line of high-performance workstations that provide the horsepower of conventional minicomputers costing 10 times as much. 

   But despite the wide anticipation of Sun's announcement, the company's share price plunged $5.25, to $35.125 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. 
Other technology stocks declined as well, though not as sharply as Sun shares. 
A Sun official said the company didn't have any explanation for the drop in the share price. 

   The new Sun-4 workstations, priced starting at $40,000, are tailored for computer-aided engineering and design uses, as well as for scientific modeling and calculation-intensive tasks. 
They are built around a new microprocessor Sun developed with the U.S. semiconductor unit of Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan. 
The new chip uses so-called RISC -- or reduced instruction set computer -- technology similar to that used in the new generation of computers made by Hewlett-Packard Co. and workstations made by International Business Machines Corp. 

   Moreover, in an unusual move, Sun said it will license Fujitsu Microelectronics Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., and other chipmakers to sell the special RISC chip to other computer manufacturers. 
The plan is aimed at establishing an industry standard around Sun's workstation and software designs, much like personal computers follow design standards set by IBM. 

   Some analysts speculated that Sun's share price fell because of the apparent riskiness of licensing its microprocessor designs to other chip makers, thus inviting companies to quickly replicate Sun's new machines. 
Others said that Digital Equipment Corp. is expected to introduce a souped up version of its Micro VAX workstation later this year that will compete directly with Sun's new machine. 

   "This is an unprecedented move on Sun's part that changes the rules of the game," said Richard Shaffer, publisher of Technologic Computer Letter. 
"Here you have a computer box company getting into the microprocessor design business that chip makers like Intel Corp. and Motorola Corp. have long dominated. 
It shows just how ambitious Sun is." 

   Indeed, the Sun-4 announcement is the latest in a flurry of new products and aggressive price-cutting actions taken by the Mountain View, Calif.-based company in recent months. 
In April, Sun chopped the price on its low-end workstation 37% to less than $5,000, a move that has since been matched by its main competitors, Apollo Computer Inc. and Digital Equipment. 
The company also recently announced a line of communications products that can connect a full array of personal computers, workstations, minicomputers, mainframes and supercomputers. 
Later this year, the company is expected to introduce some new low-end machines. 

   The new workstation, which can cost almost $100,000, is 2 1/2 times more powerful than its predecessor, the Sun-3, though it costs only about 30% more. 
It can handle 10 million instructions per second, or MIPS, which is faster than most superminicomputers. 

   Archrival Apollo, based in Chelmsford, Mass., generally has had more powerful workstations than Sun but doesn't have any products as fast as the Sun-4. 
However, rumors of Sun's new workstation have been widely circulated. 
Last week, Edward Zander, vice president, marketing, at Apollo predicted his company would be back in the race soon. 
"By early 1988, we think you'll need 25 MIPS," he said. 

   The key to the speed of the Sun workstation is the RISC chip, which Fujitsu helped design in this country, but makes in its Japanese plants. 
It marks the first time that a major U.S. computer relied on a Japanese-made microprocessor. 

   "It's a sad state that Sun would have to turn to a Japanese chip maker," said Mr. Shaffer, "but the fact is, Fujitsu makes crucial parts for a lot of this country's high performance computers." 

   According to Kenichi Katashiba, senior vice president of Fujitsu Microelectronics, the RISC chip is the product of Fujitsu's advanced products division, which was established in Santa Clara in 1984 to develop semiconductors custom designed for American customers. 

   The RISC chip works faster because it has fewer basic functions to perform. 
Sun said its design will enable Fujitsu Microelectronics and other licensees, including Cypress Semiconductor Corp. and Bipolar Integrated Technology Inc., to further enhance the chip to make it even faster and more powerful while remaining compatible with all the software for existing machines. 
Likewise, the new Sun-4 machines can run the same software that Sun's previous Sun-3 and Sun-2 families use. 

   Sun is supplying special programs that convert programs from some 90 software companies into a form the new machines can understand. 
All of Sun's computers use a version of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.'s Unix operating system as the internal traffic cop routing data and instructions between the microprocessor and the workstation's screen, keyboard, printer and data storage devices.

<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., the upstart company
that helped launch the desktop computer industry trend toward
high-powered workstations, was unveiling an entire overhaul of its
product line today.
   Some of the new machines, priced from $5,995 to $73,900, boast
sophisticated new graphics and digital sound technologies, higher
speeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion video on a
computer screen.
   Scott McNealy, Sun's president, said in a prepared statement the
revamped line is another step toward bringing more powerful desktop
computers into everyday business and personal use.
   ``Tomorrow, people will be talking to, gesturing at, and even
arguing with these machines,'' he predicted, saying his new
products reflect ``ease-of-use features found, before now, only in
personal computers.''
   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater
speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics
capabilities.
   The star of Sun's new product line is the SPARCstation 1, ``the
most powerful, full-function computer for under $9,000,'' McNealy
claimed. The price does not include disk drives.
   The machine's speed of 12.5 million instructions per second,
MIPS, is about four times the speed of similarly priced high-end
Macintosh from Apple Computer, and more than twice as fast as the
most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers. Previously, the
Sun's fastest RISC machine had a speed of 7 MIPS for $22,000.
   The new machine and the revamped older models are designed to
capture markets other than the traditional technical ones that for
years have relied on machines from Sun and rival Apollo Computer.
The companies control about 50 percent of the workstation market.
   ``This machine is the beginning of Sun getting into the volume
market,'' said Richard Shaffer, editor of Techologic Computer
Letter.
   Anil Gadre, Sun's director of marketing for graphics, predicted
the new products will help the company for the first time sell more
than 100,000 workstations in a single year.
   But Kathleen Hurley, an analyst at the research firm of
Dataquest Inc., said the power and prices of some of the new
products are comparable to others available on the commercial
market.
   Sun is using the SPARC technology, its version of so-called RISC
_ reduced instruction set computing _ in an effort to capture a
significant share of the burgeoning $4 billion workstation market.
By the mid 1990s, the market for the machines is expected to be
about $20 billion annually.
   Sun also plans to unveil during a two-day conference at the San
Francisco Civil Auditorium a library of 500 software packages than
can be run on the new systems.
   Other new products to be announced today include a revamp of the
original Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola's
fast 68030 microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start
at $5,995; a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at
$29,900; and an equally fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 that
is designed to operate as a ``server'' to interact with many
computers on a network.

   The upstart company that sparked the
desktop computer industry's trend toward higher-powered and
speedier machines on Wednesday unveiled a new generation of
products _ faster and mightier than before.
   Scott McNealy, president of Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain
View, hailed the line for ``ease-of-use features found, before now,
only in personal computers.''
   Surrounded by dazzling displays of multicolored canvas artwork
at San Francisco's Civic Auditorium, analysts and industry members
generally reacted favorably to Sun's machines.
   But not all are convinced the company can beat similar products
already released or planned by major competitors, including Apollo
Computer, Steve Jobs' Next Computer System and Digital Equipment
Corp.
   ``These are beautiful machines, clearly intended to push the
company into a bigger market,'' said software designer Ken Burton.
   ``But are these machines the right price, the right design with
the right capabilities for the business, school and personal-use
market?'' he asked. ``Or do the `other guys' have a more suitable
product for the business desktop? Only time will tell.''
   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater
speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics
capabilities, sometimes including 3-D.
   Some models of Sun's new line, priced from $5,995 to $73,900,
include or can add sophisticated new graphics and digital sound
capabilities, higher speeds and a $12,900 circuit board that allows
full-motion video on a computer screen, which can be used for
teleconferencing.
   The new and revamped products from the company, which last year
had a 28.3 percent share of the $4 billion annual workstation
market, are intended to capture a major share of the burgeoning
commercial market for workstations. By the mid 1990s, the total
annual workstation market is expected to be $20 billion. For most
of the last decade, workstations were used primarily by scientists
and engineers.
   The company's success for its new line is pinned on its
comparatively vast library of software available for it.
Competitors so far have fewer few software packages for their
machines.
   The company's SPARCstation 1, the so-called ``star'' of the new
line, will have the ability, for an additional $500, to emulate the
MS-DOS operating system of Microsoft Corp. That will allow the
SPARCstation to run popular programs written for IBM personal
computers, although at a lower speed.
   SPARCstation 1's $8,995 pricetag does not include a disk drive.
   Its speed of 12.5 million instructions per second, or MIPS, is
about four times the speed of the similarly priced high-end
Macintosh from Apple Computer and more than twice as fast as the
most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers.
   Previously, Sun's fastest machine using so-called reduced
instruction computing set technology, or RISC, had a speed of 7
mips and was priced at $22,000. Sun's version of RISC is called
SPARC.
   The SPARCstation 1 offers built-in digital audio capability,
eight megabytes of internal memory, three expansion slots, a
black-and-white screen and a size that is less than half the height
of a traditional PC console. A color-monitor version is available
for $15,500.
   Other new products announced included a revamp of the original
Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola's fast 68030
microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start at $5,995;
a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at $29,900; and
an equally-fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 that is designed
to operate as a ``server'' to interact with many computers on a
network.
   Prime Computer Inc. announced Wednesday that it plans to
incorporate SPARC technology in future engineering workstations.
With this strategy, Sun hopes to turn its SPARC-based systems into
an industry standard.
   Other manufacturers offer machines that compare with Sun's new
models: DEC offers an eight megabyte internal memory workstation,
without disks, with a speed of 14 MIPS for $11,900, but no
expansion slots; Data General offers one with 17 MIPS for $7,450,
but with only four megabytes of internal memory and no expansion
slots.
   Next Inc.'s machine at $9995 will offer five MIPS with three
expanson slots and 256-megabytes of optical disk storage capacity
and eight megabytes of internal memory.

   The workstation is about to become cheaper and portable as
well, continuing its penetration of the personal-computer
market.
   Sun Microsystems Inc., of Mountain View, Calif., is
expected to unveil on Tuesday a new low-cost version of its
popular Sparcstation that puts it in the price range of many
personal computers. And Tokyo's Toshiba Corp., in a bid to
expand its share of the rapidly growing market for
workstations, said it would begin selling the world's first
portable workstation.

   Sun's machine, expected to cost just under $5,000, is just
the latest in a technological leapfrogging game by computer
makers; rivals say they will soon best Sun's machine with
still faster, cheaper workstations.
   Toshiba's announcement comes a month after Japanese rival
Sony Corp. announced it would sell a portable workstation by
late July. Toshiba said it hopes to begin production of its
new machine, based on Sun's Sparc chip, in the U.S. by the
end of the year, officials said at a Tokyo news conference.
It is scheduled to go on sale in Japan in mid-July.
   Called the Sparc LT model, it is the latest demonstration
of Toshiba's ability to pack more and more computing power
into smaller and smaller machines. The company, long a minor
player in computer sales, has become a world leader in laptop
personal computers in the past three years. The new
workstation "is going to extend the market because you're
going to be able to do more things with it," said Peter G.
Wolff, a technology analyst with Kidder Peabody's Tokyo
office. "It's an innovative step."
   But many computer makers say the market for laptop
workstations is limited. Since the main users of workstations
are scientists and engineers, who typically work with
equipment that isn't readily movable, the advantages of
portability aren't as clear-cut as they are for
personal-computer users.
   In addition, workstations usually gain much of their
usefulness from being hooked up to one another and to other
computers. As a result, users aren't very likely to use them
at home or on the road, as many business executives do with
portable personal computers.
   Workstations, which combine high speed with flashy
graphics and usually run the Unix operating system, until
recently have been high-priced desktop machines selling for
$20,000 and up. But prices have fallen steeply since last
year as makers worked toward the high end of the
personal-computer market.
   "The technology wars are really heating up and the
technology price curve is getting steeper," said John Hime,
vice president of systems products marketing at MIPS Computer
Systems Inc. "Sun's got a great machine, but other companies
like MIPS are introducing technology just as fast, if not
faster."
   The new Sun machine, called the Sparcstation SLC, will run
at 12.5 million operations per second, analysts familiar with
the machine say. The $5,000 price tag brings the computer
well into the price range of high-end personal computers,
which don't run as fast and have poorer graphics. Sun's
cheapest machine now is the $8,995 Sparcstation 1-Plus.
   Still, the Sun machine may lack important components. The
SLC will be a stripped-down version of Sun's Sparcstation
built into a 17-inch monochrome monitor with no disk drive
and no ability to be expanded with add-in cards. So it will
have to be tied into a network of other computers to be
useful.
   What's more, any low-priced workstation faces a basic
hurdle: Most of the software programs that businesses use are
written to run on Microsoft Corp.'s MSDOS operating system,
not on the Unix operating system used by Sun.
   Sun's rivals are critical of the new product. "I don't
think they'll have the performance in the box to make up for
all the things the box doesn't have," said Donald Gaubatz,
group manager for workstations at Digital Equipment Corp.
Digital began selling last year a $5,950 workstation that is
only slightly slower than the Sparcstation, he said, adding
that the company plans to keep the price competitively low.
   MIPS, likewise, said it plans price cuts and performance
improvements that will bring its machines in line with Sun's
by this summer. Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to sell later this
year a low-end workstation based on Motorola Inc.'s new 68040
microprocessor chip. Hewlett now has the cheapest
workstation, the $3,990 DN 2500, running at about 40% the
speed of the new Sun machine, said Mark Tolliver, Hewlett's
workstation-marketing manager. "We have no intention of
surrendering that position," he said.
   The new Toshiba machine, which weighs 17.7 pounds, has a
fold-up screen. Company officials said it weighs a third as
much as the basic Sun model sold in Japan, and takes up half
the space. It has a processing speed of 13.2 mips and will
sell in Japan for about two million yen (about $12,600).
Toshiba expects to sell about 3,000 of the machines in Japan
this year and about 14,000 next year.
   But, in addition to concerns about the practicality of a
laptop workstation, the Sparc LT has some technological
constraints that may limit its use. It currently has only a
built-in black and white screen. Color, often a crucial
feature for the scientists and engineers who are the main
workstation users, won't be available for more than two
years. Unlike battery-operable laptop computers, the machine
has to be plugged in.
   Toshiba's market projections for laptops are "rubbish,"
said Vicky Brown of International Data Corp. of Framington,
Mass. "Can you see someone carrying 18 pounds on the bullet
train? We're far away from the point where we're going to
have a big market for laptop workstations."
   Digital's Mr. Gaubatz agrees. Users of Unix workstations
depend heavily on networks that tie them together with other
machines, he said. "There will be some people who would find
a reason to buy it," he said. But most users "are just too
intimately connected to their network. You don't have that if
you have the thing on your lap."
   But Toshiba officials say that, with desk space more
cramped in Japan than in the U.S., such smaller machines may
have greater appeal in their home market. And they say they
are simplifying the software to try and broaden the base of
traditional workstation users.
   Toshiba has been selling Sun workstations in Japan since
1986, and a year ago signed an agreement with Sun allowing it
to develop and manufacture machines based on the Sun system.
"Sun welcomes the Sparc LT," said Scott McNealy, Sun's
chairman, in a statement videotaped for yesterday's press
conference. "This complementary product will expand the
market for Sparc workstations and servers, just as the PC
market was enhanced by the arrival of laptops."
   The Japanese, who still have only a tiny share of the
world computer market, have been jumping into the $6 billion
workstation market. Sony is Japan's leader with its News
workstation, which it started selling in 1987, and exporting
the following year.

   These are tumultuous times for makers of microprocessors,
the tiny chips that play central commander in desktop
computers.
   For a decade, Intel Corp. has dominated the market for
these brainy chips and has profited handsomely as demand
boomed for personal computers using Intel-designed chips.
Motorola Inc.'s chips have been a distant second, the chips
of choice for engineers' computers and for Apple's Macintosh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now a new breed of fast chips is threatening to bring
a change of guard, and to create a new set of winners and
losers in the computer market. The new chips use a technology
called reduced-instruction-set computing, or Risc, a term
used to describe a set of techniques for laying out circuitry
so that chips can perform calculations faster than with older
methods. Risc chips are rapidly winning favor with computer
makers because the chips offer far more speed at lower prices
than older chips offer.
   The power of Risc chips is showing up in the market. Sun
Microsystems Inc., an early leader in Risc chips, has quickly
gained No. 1 share of the workstation market using its Risc
chip. And Sun is making inroads into PC turf with low-cost
Risc workstations. Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a machine
using its own Risc chip in March that runs as much as 10
times faster than similarly priced systems using Intel's
latest chip.
   Intel-designed chips still go into 80% of the PCs sold
world-wide, and the PC market is still 10 times bigger than
the workstation market. But computer makers see in Risc chips
an opportunity to recarve the computer-market pie.
   The big gamble: which of a half-dozen Risc chips to
choose. Compaq Computer Corp. has formed a loose alliance
with Digital Equipment Corp. and others that sided with a
Risc chip designed by start-up Mips Computer Systems Inc.
Toshiba Corp. and several Taiwanese clone makers have chosen
Sun's chip. Hitachi Ltd. sides with HP's chip; Data General
Corp. has chosen Motorola's, while IBM uses its own.
   The name of the game for the Risc-chip makers is to woo a
critical mass of computer makers; those who fail to win
allies will become also-rans, locked out of big-volume
markets. The game for computer makers is to bet which chip
will garner the most other computer makers, the most software
and the most users; those that bet on the wrong chip will be
left with warehouses full of machines that no one wants.

<HL> Sun Microsystems to Unveil Computers For General Use Based on 80386 Chip </HL>
<AUTHOR> Brenton R. Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> SUNW </CO>

<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of technical workstations, will announce today a new family of general-purpose computer workstations built around Intel Corp.'s popular 80386 microprocessor. 

   The new computers, with suggested prices starting at about $8,000, represent Sun's first foray into the crowded personal computer market and will give users the ability to run programs written for either of two popular computer operating systems -- Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS, which is widely used in most personal computers, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix, which is the system of choice for engineering and scientific computers. 

   "Sun's new computers are a bridge between the commercial world of DOS and the technical world of Unix in a single box," said David Korus, a securities analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. who follows the small computer systems industry. 
"It also further blurs the distinction between personal computers and workstations." 

   Workstations in the past have been used for sophisticated financial modeling and computer-aided engineering and design. 
Recently, price performance improvements have made them comparable in price to powerful personal computers. 

   Sun's introduction of the 386i family of computers had been widely rumored for months. 
"The timing just kind of happened," said Scott McNealy, president and chief executive officer of the Mountain View, Calif., company, who said the delay was due in part to "trying to understand the shortage of memory chips," which has been a nagging problem for Sun. 
Earlier this year, Sun had to raise prices on workstations as memory chip prices have climbed. 
Meanwhile chip shortages have caused Sun's backlog for its most popular computers to balloon to 120 days. 

   The new machines will come equipped with a monitor, a floppy disk-drive data storage device, a mouse pointing device, copies of both Unix and MS-DOS operating systems, circuitry necessary to plug the machine into a network and four megabytes of memory -- twice the amount provided by most competing personal computers using the Intel 80386. 

   "We think our machine compares favorably with the Compaq (Computer Corp.) 
Deskpro 386," said Mr. McNealy, referring to the first personal computer to incorporate the powerful Intel chip. 
The Compaq machine, priced from about $6,000 and up, not including Unix, has been popular among power-hungry technical users and has far outsold competing machines. 

   Sun's new 386i family expands the company's family tree to include computers based on three different microprocessors, all using Unix. 
Sun started out building machines around Motorola Inc.'s 68000 family of microprocessors. 
Last year, Sun unveiled a high-performance chip called SPARC, for Scalable Processor architecture, that it uses in its most expensive and powerful workstations. 

   While Unix is the common thread among all three, analysts worry that three different hardware "architectures" might be too much for Sun to support. 
"The problem many computer companies run into is trying to do too many things to do any of them well," said Richard Shaffer, a computer industry analyst and consultant who publishes Technologic Computer Letter. 

   The 386i family presents other potential problems for Sun. 
If it catches on in a big way, it could exacerbate Sun's chip supply problems and perhaps cannibalize sales of its big-selling 3/60 workstation, which faces lengthy production delays.

   Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry,
but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.
   Analysts say results for the December quarter will
illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many
makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains
while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a
highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of
oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting
some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View,
Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast
workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much
as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.
   A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such
as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect
to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing
trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard
software such as programs written for Unix operating systems.
That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run
software written only for them.
   But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession
signs, continue to post strong gains. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin
of Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. expects Compaq to post a 70% rise
in fourth-quarter earnings to $133 million, or $1.55 a share,
from the year-earlier $79 million, or 92 cents a share, on a
40% revenue gain to $1.1 billion from $788 million.
   Compaq's growth is outpacing other leading
desktop-computer makers mainly because of its huge presence
in the booming market for laptop and notebook computers, said
Mr. Lupatkin.
   Sun Microsystems is expected to post strong gains in
profit and revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending
Monday. Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens &amp;
Co., expects Sun's profit to increase 73% to $35 million, or
34 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 23 cents a share, on
a 22% rise in revenue to $725 million from $595 million a
year earlier.
   Not all desktop makers are in the pink. Cupertino,
Calif.-based Apple Computer Inc., for instance, is expected
to post roughly flat results for its fiscal first quarter
ending Monday. Mr. Lupatkin, of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, expects
slightly lower profit of $115 million, or $1 a share, vs.
$125 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales are
expected to exceed $1.5 billion vs. $1.49 billion. For Apple
to see stronger sales, it needs to enter the laptop and
notebook market, Mr. Lupatkin says.
   Some old-line makers -- including DEC -- have bigger
problems as recession fears slow capital spending. Robert
Herwick of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, who admits he is "a rip-roaring
bear" on Digital, expects the company to post lower net
income of about $60 million, or 50 cents a share, for the
quarter, compared with $155.4 million, or $1.25 a share, a
year earlier. He expects sales of $3.1 billion vs. $3.18
billion.
   Also, Mr. Herwick says, "the shift away from proprietary
systems to Unix systems in the workstation market is costing
DEC market share." That has hurt Unisys, too, says analyst
Stephen Cohen of SoundView Financial Group. He expects Unisys
to post a net loss of $46 million, or 29 cents a share, for
the quarter on lower revenue of $2.8 billion. A year earlier,
Unisys earned $34 million, or five cents a share, on revenue
of $2.97 billion.
   Unisys is struggling because of a heavy debt load and
users defecting to open systems, Mr. Cohen says. "The old
core business is declining in profitability and the new
open-systems business they're growing to replace that with
has inherently lower margins," says Mr. Cohen.
   Spending slowdowns in the security and banking industries
have hurt Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. more
than expected, says analyst John Jones of Montgomery
Securities. He recently lowered his earnings estimates for
the company and now expects net income in its fiscal first
quarter ending Monday to fall 74% to $8 million, or seven
cents a share, from $30.7 million, or 29 cents a share, a
year earlier. He sees sales rising 4.7% to $457 million from
$436.5 million.
   A general slowdown in capital spending could be helping
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Amdahl Corp., because its
IBM-compatible mainframes are less expensive than
International Business Machines Corp.'s own machines, Mr.
Jones says. He expects Amdahl's fourth-quarter net income to
rise 49% to $62 million, or 55 cents a share, from $41.6
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. He expects
revenue to decline to $615 million from $625.8 million,
partly because of a product transition.
   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, meanwhile, is expected to have a
respectable fourth quarter, in part because of the success of
its new air-cooled mainframes, says Mr. Cohen of SoundView.
He expects higher net income of $2.3 billion, or $4 a share,
vs. the year-earlier $591 million, or $1.04 a share,
including a $2.42 billion pretax charge. Mr. Cohen expects
sales of $22 billion vs. $20.4 billion last year. He says
IBM's introduction of ES/9000 computers last fall spurred
sales.

<HL> Sun Microsystems Unveils Low-Cost Sun-4 Workstation </HL>

<CO> SUNW </CO>

<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced a low-cost version of its Sun-4 workstation that analysts say represents a price-for-performance breakthrough in the high-speed workstation field. 

   Known as the Sun-4/110, the machine is capable of handling seven million instructions per second and sells for $19,000, about $20,000 less than a speedier version unveiled in July. 

   "That kind of performance for twenty grand" currently is unrivaled among workstation makers, said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter, a New York-based newsletter. 

   "This is a powerful machine for the price," added Lisa Thorell, an analyst for Dataquest, a Silicon Valley high technology market research firm. 
Ms. Thorell said a Dataquest analysis, assuming the Sun-4/110 performs as advertised, indicates that buyers seeking comparable performance would have to spend about double the cost of the machine. 

   Despite the bullishness of analysts, Sun's stock was battered in a general decline of high-technology issues. 
Sun closed yesterday at $29.75 a share, down $2.50 in national over-the-counter trading. 

   Sun said the new workstations are available immediately and would be shipped within 30 days of receipt of orders. 
It declined to estimate sales but said it has already sold about 1,000 units of its previously introduced Sun-4/200 series, which has a base price of about $39,000. 

   Sun said the low-cost workstations would be marketed to users in the financial analysis, artificial intelligence, medical imaging and computer-aided design fields. 
The basic Sun-4/110 is equipped with eight megabytes of memory and a monochrome monitor. 
Sun also said it would begin offering an optional 327-megabyte, 5 1/4-inch disk drive to add capacity to all of its Sun-4 workstations. 

   The Sun-4/110 represents the latest in a flurry of new products and aggressive price-cutting by the Mountain View, Calif., computer maker, whose machines are developed around superfast microchips known as RISC, or reduced instruction set computer. 
Sun, in its announcement, called the Sun-4/110 "the first supercomputing desktop computer," though not everyone buys that claim. 

   Though the definition of supercomputers is somewhat hazy, Mr. Shaffer said Sun's claims for the Sun-4/110 are "something of a stretch" since supercomputers currently are generally considered to have much faster processing speeds than the Sun unit.

   MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. slashed prices
25% to 40% on older products in one line of workstations and
introduced some new models.
   The price cuts affected its DECstation and DECsystem
computers based on the Mips Computer Systems Inc. RISC
design. For example, the entry level DECstation 2100 was cut
to $5,950 from $7,950 and the DECsystem 5400 computer was cut
to $30,000 from $49,900.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Price cuts on older models frequently accompany
new-product introductions in the computer industry. However,
Russ Crabs, an analyst with Soundview Financial Group,
Stamford, Conn., said the sharp cuts were "a surprise
component" of Digital's new-product announcement. He said
Digital may be "making a pre-emptive move" to counter a
low-priced RISC computer expected from workstation leader Sun
Microsystems Inc. later this year.
   Vicki Brown, who follows the workstation market for
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., said that while
Digital has had lower-priced RISC workstations than Sun since
the DECstation's introduction in early 1989, they have been
slow sellers. With new models and an increasing amount of
software available, she predicted Digital will sell about
25,000 of the RISC systems this year compared with just 6,000
last year. She expects Sun to sell 100,000 of its
Sparcstation RISC systems this year.
   Digital's new workstation line, the DECstation 5000, will
have a base price of $14,995. The workstation runs at 24
million instructions per second, almost as fast as the speed
claimed by International Business Machines Corp. for its
entry-level RS/6000 workstation. Digital's 5000 comes in four
models, depending on graphics capabilities, with the top
color model priced at $51,100.
   Digital also said that in June it will introduce more
powerful members of the RISC-based multiuser 5800 family. The
two additional models will include three or four
microprocessors and run at speeds up to 62 million
instructions per second. With price cuts on the two existing
models, pricing for the 5800 series now runs from $75,000 to
$160,000.

<HL> Sun Microsystems Slashes Price 36%
On Workstation to Thwart IBM, Apple

<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc. slashed the price of its least expensive computer workstations 36% in an attempt to preempt encroachment into its markets by powerful new personal computers from Apple Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. 

   "We've basically declared war on the low-end workstation market," said Scott McNealy, Sun's president and chief executive officer, who contends that the new prices for Sun's 3/50M workstations make them less costly than comparably equipped personal computers. 
The 3/50M, now priced at $4,995, is used by professional printers for typesetting and page layout, and by engineers designing everything from computer software to automobiles and jet engines. 

   Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun announced the price cuts within a month of announcements by both IBM and Apple of their intent to enter the market for technical workstations with souped up personal computers. 

   Last week, for example, IBM announced a series of new personal computers, including its Personal System/2 Model 80, which is built around an Intel Corp. 80386 microprocessor. 
The machine, priced from $6,995, will be capable of many of the sophisticated engineering tasks that Sun's workstations can perform, but software for those functions won't be available until late next year. 
In March, Apple unveiled its Macintosh II, priced from $4,800 and aimed squarely at the engineering, publishing and technical workstation markets. 

   Both the IBM and Apple machines, however, require the purchase of software and accessories to match the performance of the Sun workstation. 

   "The difference between us and them is that they're announcing products that will become available in the next 12 to 18 months, while we're shipping ours in volume," said Mr. McNealy in an interview. 
"Plus, we have over 850 software applications that will work right now, not next year," he added. 

   Historically, markets for technical workstations have been rather small. 
Analysts estimate that since its founding in 1981, Sun has sold about 38,000 workstations, most of which are 3/50M models. 
Its main competitor, Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo Computer Inc., has sold about 30,000 workstations, and analysts estimate that other manufacturers such as Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have sold about 35,000 workstations. 
By contrast, about nine million personal computers have been sold. 

   But as the distinction begins to blur between personal computers and more sophisticated workstations, both in terms of price and performance, market opportunities broaden for both industries. 
Indeed, Mr. McNealy said he would like to see Sun expand its markets down into areas traditionally served by personal computer manufacturers -- such as more conventional office automation -- even as personal computer makers are attempting to move into more sophisticated markets. 

   "We think there's the opportunity to sell in the tens of thousands of workstations easily, if not more than that" each year, Mr. McNealy said. 
"Our factory is primed so we can pump these out like cookies." 

   Analysts say Sun's aim is defensive as much as anything. 
"Sun is certainly mindful of competition from three areas: IBM, Apple and folks in the Far East like NEC Corp.," said Robert Herwick, an analyst for Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco-based investment banking firm. 
"They have to be looking over their shoulder all the time," Mr. Herwick added. 

   That's because Sun's workstations run software that uses an industry standard operating system called Unix. 
While that means the Sun machines have access to a greater library of software, it also leaves their hardware vulnerable to being cloned, much like IBM's personal computers, especially as manufacturing costs decline. 

   In response to Sun's announcement, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple's manager of business marketing, John Zeisler, said he didn't think Sun's pricing strategy would necessarily pit the two companies against each other. 
"Sun workstations typically are sold in a configuration of five or eight workstations, while a Macintosh II will be more of a stand-alone workstation," he said. 

   A spokesman for Apollo Computer said that the company doesn't have any workstations directly competing with the low end of Sun's line, and that its units remain priced competitively against Sun's more powerful models. 
He said Apollo doesn't have any plans for price cuts at the current time. 
Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it doesn't comment on announcements by competitors. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares fell $2.375 to close at $32. 

   Separately, Burlington, Mass.-based Xylogics Inc. said it received a $20 million contract to supply disk controllers to Sun for two years.

   IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations
Thursday that the company says outperform and underprice the
competition and should help it snare a major stake in a
fast-growing market where it never had success.
   ``The opportunity is big _ it's growing at over 30 percent a
year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM,'' said President
Jack D. Kuehler.
   The machines, called the RISC System-6000, also mark the first
time that the world's largest computer maker has wholeheartedly
embraced the Unix computer operating system that is fast becoming
the industry standard.
   International Business Machines Corp. also announced its
intention to provide ways to link the new machines with IBM
computers that run on its proprietary operating system.
   An operating system is software that controls basic computer
functions, such as executing commands from the keyboard and opening
computer files.
   Kuehler told a news conference that the new machines, designed
for use by engineers, ``outperform the newest and best that our
competitors offer.''
   IBM announced four high-performance workstations and five
file-servers, which are used to link computers in a network. The
machines range in price from about $13,000 to more than $74,000.
   IBM said the lowest-price model is the most powerful desktop
workstation on the market, beating the offering of Sun Microsystems
Inc., considered the workstation leader. The IBM model performs
27.5 million instructions per second, or mips, compared with 12.5
mips for the Sun model. It also is slightly cheaper than Sun's.
   Industry analysts say the workstations are impressive for their
performance, pricing and features.
   ``From the customer standpoint, I think it's going to get IBM
into the door in ways it didn't before,'' said Peter Burris, an
analyst for International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   Workstations are desktop or side-of-desk machines that are much
more powerful than personal computers. Some even match the power of
mainframes. They are used for such processing-intensive tasks as
three-dimensional computer modeling of new products.
   The workstation market is small, but is among the
fastest-growing computer segments, and uses for the machines are
expanding.
   ``A lot of things start in the scientific market and gravitate
out toward other markets,'' said Barry Bosak, an analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   IBM introduced a workstation line several years ago, the RT
line, but it captured less than 3 percent of market. Experts
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced.
   ``We made a mistake,'' Kuehler said in an interview.
   The workstation field is dominated by Sun, Digital Equipment
Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Unix, developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., allows
machines from different manufacturers to work together. Until now,
IBM had promoted its own operating systems. Basing the workstations
on Unix shows IBM is serious about this market, Kuehler said in the
interview.
   It also is recognition of the huge library of Unix-based
software available for workstations, he said.
   The machines are based on IBM's own version of Unix, called AIX,
but are a new generation of the operating system. Analysts said the
new AIX is even more compatible with industry standards.
   Unix-based applications programs _ the software that provides
the actual uses of computers, such as word processing _ must be
rewritten for AIX.
   IBM has been working with software companies for some time to
develop programs for the new machines. By the end of the year,
about 1,500 application programs worldwide will be available, it
said.
   IBM's embrace of Unix has broad implications for the operating
standard, said Louise Rehling, a senior vice president at SPSS
Inc., a Chicago software company that was among those recruited.
   ``We think IBM is going to bring a lot of credibility to the
Unix markeplace,'' she said. ``The size of the pie will grow as
well as the IBM share.''
   Like the older IBM workstations, the new models are based on
reduced-instruction-set computing technology, or RISC, which
simplifies the circuitry of a computer's central processor to
increase speed and offer cost savings. But IBM said the RISC system
in the new machines is greatly improved.
   Shipments of the workstations will begin within 90 days, IBM
said.
   Bosak said the workstations would have little short-term impact
on IBM's earnings. But they represent an important signal that the
company is working to improve its fortunes.
   Last month, IBM reported its 1989 profit slipped 35 percent from
the year before. The company also has embarked on a cost-cutting
program that involves the elimination of thousands of jobs.

   Sun Microsystems Inc. said it raised prices on its workstations by an average of 7%, passing on to customers the higher cost for computer components such as DRAM memory chips. 

   Sun's move follows the trend of recent price increases by such companies as Digital Equipment, IBM and Apple Computer. 

   The increase, for example, raises the price of Sun's entry level workstation, the Sun-3/50, to $5495 from $4995. 
Also raised 7% were prices for Sun's file server products. 
System prices for newer products were raised an average of 6%, while prices for older product lines were hiked by 10% to 15%. 

   Sun, based in Mountain View, Calif., said the increased prices will help the company purchase larger quantities of memory components, thereby increasing manufacturing and driving down "unacceptably long lead times" for its products.

COMPUTER workstations are 'not just for 'techies' anymore', Sun
Microsystems, market leader, has declared.
These high performance desktop computers have until recently been aimed
primarily at engineering and scientific applications. Sun and others see a
new market opportunity for workstations as high-powered business computers.
'The mass penetration of workstations into markets dominated by personal
computers, minicomputers and mainframes isn't a future event - it has
already happened,' Sun claims.
The marriage of computer workstation performance with the vast software base
of the PC is luring dozens of computer makers and software developers into
this emerging market. PC companies such as Compaq Computer and Apple
Computer are planning to build more powerful desktop machines based upon
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors borrowed from the
engineering workstation world.
Workstation manufacturers such as Sun, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard
are targeting business users as well as their traditional engineering and
scientific markets. The technical features and market characteristics that
divide the PC and workstation markets are fast disappearing.
Business applications are increasingly being ported to varieties of the Unix
operating system which is widely used on engineering workstations. The raw
data processing power of the PC vies with that of low end workstations.
Distribution patterns are also overlapping.
Traditionally, workstations have been sold primarily by direct sales forces
or through value-added resellers who add specialised software. Increasingly,
however, workstations are being offered by the computer dealers and retail
outlets that dominate the PC market. However, as workstations enter the
business market a conflict between PC and workstation software standards has
arisen.
While Microsoft's DOS operating system dominates the PC world, Unix - in
various forms - is the operating system of choice for workstations. Backers
of the Advanced Computindustry consortium of 21 companies, have declared
their support for both a future unified version of Unix and a future version
of Microsoft's OS/2 operating system.
Members of the group acknowledge that they are hedging their bets, until it
becomes clearer which way the business workstation market will move. The
emergence of workstations as business computers has added to the fierce
competition in all sectors of the Dollars 7.5bn workstation market.
Sales of workstations are expected to total Dollars 9.2bn this year and
reach over Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to Dataquest, the market research
company. Sun Microsystems is the clear winner in workstations, with a
dominant 32 per cent market share.
Sun's combination of the Sparc Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
microprocessor and SunOS version of Unix has attracted several licensed
cloners who offer Sun-compatible computers.
Sun's strategy has been to establish Sparc as an industry standard and
mostly through the success of its own products it is succeeding. Industry
analysts predict that Sun will continue to lead the workstation market
throughout the early 1990s although International Business Machines may
aggressively challenge Sun.
'By 1992-93 Sun and IBM may tie for first place among workstation vendors,'
predicts Ms Vicki Brown of International Data.
IBM has made a remarkable resurgence in the workstation market since its
introduction, a year ago, of a range of products based upon its own RISC
design.
The company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/6000 workstations in 1990 and
gained a 6.6 per cent share in the market. Sales are expected to rise to
Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars 2bn this year.
Hewlett-Packard, the number two workstation vendor, lost market share in
1990 but is expected to make a strong recovery this year with the recent
introduction of a new product range.
Using an enhanced version of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
architecture upon which its minicomputers are based, HP has taken a
technological leapfrog to produce machines that greatly outperform
comparably priced workstations from its main competitors.
HP's new top of the range Series 700 Model 730 workstation is twice as fast
as IBM's fastest workstation, and 3.5 times the performance of Sun
Microsystems Sparcstation 3, HP claims.
Digital Equipment saw its share of the workstation market reduced in 1990 to
17 per cent from 23 per cent in the previous year, according to IDC.
Digital is aggressively supporting Ace, the Advanced Computing Environment
initiative, and plans to upgrade its DEC station product line with new
workstations based upon the powerful R4000 Mips computer RISC chip, when
that device becomes available.
'Marketing prowess and execution - not pure technology - will ultimately
determine the winners in the workstation market,' predicts Ms Brown of IDC.
A challenge for all workstation participants will be to maintain profit
margins as average workstation prices fall and to adjust to new distribution
channels as the market for workstations expands.

<HL> Sun Microsystems to Announce Products
For Linking to Other Computer Systems

    Sun Microsystems Inc. will
announce today products that will allow its workstations to
be used as intermediary systems between mainframes,
minicomputers and personal computers.
   The new products include SunLink, a package of hardware and software that enables a Sun workstation to connect directly into an International Business Machines Corp. mainframe computer, providing high-speed communications capable of transmitting three million characters a second, the equivalent of 1,500 double-spaced, typewritten pages. 
This means SunLink, which will be available in August and will cost about $20,000, can support a network of as many as 128 workstations entering simultaneous transactions. 

   The other major product is an enhanced version of TOPS, a software that enables IBM personal computers and Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh personal computers to share data. 
The new version, produced by Sun's recently acquired Centram Systems West Inc. unit, will translate data from Apple and IBM computers into a form usable by Sun workstations, mainframes and even supercomputers. 
Sun hasn't set a price for the new version, which will be available in the third calendar quarter. 

   The new products are "designed so that a user can get to all of his company's computer resources from his desktop system, without having to know the idiosyncrasies of every machine on the network," said Scott McNealy, Sun's president and chief executive officer. 

   According to Eric Schmidt, Sun's vice president and general manager of software products, the products also "allow Sun's workstations to be used in many more situations than previously accessible," namely conventional business settings. 
Up to now, Sun's workstations have been used mainly as computer-aided design tools, or for professional photo-typesetting. 
In its five-year history, Sun has sold about 36,000 workstations. 

   To make its workstations more attractive to conventional businesses, Sun recently lowered the price of its least-expensive workstation by 37% to $4,995, in an attempt to begin competing directly in some markets now dominated by personal computers. 
Sun's workstations, which usually are sold in networks of five or more, provide larger screens, fancier graphics and number-crunching abilities than most personal computers. 
Common business applications software, such as spreadsheets, accounting, database systems must be written for Unix, a standard operating system developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. that Sun uses in its workstations, before Sun can hope to sell many workstations as general business machines. 

   Meanwhile, with easier access to personal computers and mainframes that the new products provide, Sun hopes its workstations will come to be used as "gateways for high-performance interplay with other systems," said Mr. Schmidt.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. said it will
unveil today a low-priced workstation aimed at business
users, the latest in a recent volley of inexpensive yet
powerful new workstations from makers who are battling for
new markets.
   The new machine, the Model 425e, will rival in price the
lowest-priced workstations on the market. The 425e will list
for $5,490 but runs as much as 76% faster, for example, than
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s bottom-end machine, the $4,995
Sparcstation SLC, Hewlett-Packard said.

   Hewlett-Packard, Sun and other workstation makers are
trying to expand the market for their workstations into the
office -- usually the turf of personal computers and
mainframes. "That's the real sweet spot of the market," said
Karl Freund, Hewlett-Packard's workstation-marketing manager.
   Mr. Freund said Hewlett-Packard engineers tailored the
425e to the business user by stripping out features such as
fast graphics and special printer sockets that, while vital
to workstations' usual engineering users, aren't needed for
most business tasks but add cost to a machine.
   The new Hewlett-Packard machine, on the other hand,
includes amenities that makers have until now kept out of
their low-priced workstations to hold down to around $5,000.
Sun's bare-bones SLC and Hewlett-Packard's older $4,990 400DL
workstation are monochrome-only machines that are limited to
16 megabytes of internal memory and can't accept internal
hard-disk drives.
   Hewlett-Packard said its new 425e, which uses Motorola
Inc.'s 68040 microprocessor chip, can plug into color
monitors, can contain as many as 48 megabytes of internal
memory and can hold as much as an 840 megabyte hard-disk
drive. The machine has circuitry to process audio
information, such as music from compact disks or speech from
a microphone, and store it in digital form on hard-disk
drives.
   Hewlett-Packard said it has received orders for 10,000 of
the new machines, including an order valued at $40 million
from GTE Corp.'s GTE Telephone Operations unit.
Hewlett-Packard said it also will announce today two new
higher-end 425 models -- the Model 425t for $8,990 and the
425s for $21,490 -- which will include additional features
such as more memory.

   The competition among makers of low-end workstations and high-end personal computers may be about to get much fiercer. 

   Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to announce today an alliance with South Korea's Samsung Group. 
Under the agreement, Samsung Electronics Co. will manufacture both microprocessor chips and workstations using Hewlett-Packard's reduced-instruction-set-computing (RISC) technology and UNIX software. 
RISC chips are very fast, powerful microprocessors; UNIX is an operating system offering multi-tasking and advanced graphic capabilities. 

   The centerpiece of their plan, the companies said, is to produce a $5,000 workstation within two years. 
Such a machine, with several times the processing power of today's entry-level machines that cost about $10,000, would compete not only with low-end workstations made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp., but also with high-performance personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. 

   Hewlett-Packard said it will buy some of the Samsung workstations and resell them under its own name. 
Samsung can also sell the machines on its own. 

   An industry consultant, Andrew Allison, said the two companies will have to ship the machine, or at least a version with performance comparable to Sun's least expensive machine, the SparcStation 1, by late next year for it to be competitive. 
He said they are capable of meeting such a deadline. 
Sun Microsystems has forged an alliance with two Taiwanese companies, to clone and ship low-cost versions of its workstations next year. 

   The strategic aim of the alliance with Samsung is to enlist Samsung's renowned ability to manufacture products, including a clone of IBM's personal computers, at very low costs, with low margins. 
Hewlett-Packard is known as a producer of high-performance machines, at high margins, and wants to stay in that market. 
"Clearly, we think this relationship is going to make us more competitive in the low end of the business," said Bill Kay, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's workstation group. 

   But just as clearly, Hewlett-Packard's direct competitors weren't impressed. 
"Very simply, it's too little, too late," said Chester Silvestri, vice president for technology products for MIPS Computer Systems Inc., which licences RISC chips to manufacturers, including Digital. 

   Sun Microsystems said the Samsung alliance confers no special competitive advantage on Hewlett-Packard, since Sun could buy and resell machines made by low-cost producers in the Far East, if it so chose. 
Its SparcStation 1 is already priced at about $10,000. 

   Nonetheless, Hewlett-Packard is a huge company with much greater resources than Sun and MIPS. 
It dominates the RISC market with its line of high-end workstations, and is the leading maker of all kinds of workstations with its recent acquisition of Apollo Computer. 
Although late to the low-end of the RISC computer market, it could be a formidable competitor. 

   The Samsung alliance "is a major announcement," asserted Mr. Allison. 
"It puts another gorilla into the low-end UNIX systems cage." 

   In the past, RISC/UNIX machines have been very expensive, and limited mostly to scientific and engineering applications. 
But Sun Microsystems has led a movement to offer less expensive workstations that are beginning to compete with IBM's PS/2 line and with Apple Computer's Macintosh. 

   The market for RISC/UNIX machines, while relatively small, is growing much faster than the market for computers using MS/DOS -- the operating system for personal computers made by IBM and its clones -- or for Apple's proprietary operating system. 
In many cases, the RISC/ UNIX machines offer more speed for less money, and already offer graphics and multi-tasking capabilities that MS/DOS users can get only by upgrading to IBM's expensive new OS/2 operating system. 

   The major constraint on their invasion of the personal-computer market is the lack of commercial applications. 
Mr. Allison predicted that these machines will run MS/DOS as well as UNIX within two years. 
"It is just a prerequisite to penetrate the PC market," Mr. Allison said. 
"They will all do it." 

   After that, the main problem facing makers of both powerful personal computers and powerful RISC/UNIX machines will be the lack of software applications that fully tap their power. 
"Why do I need a $20,000 OS/2 computer to run an application that can run as fast on a $2,000 PC?" asked Mr. Allison. 

   Hewlett-Packard said it will also help Samsung develop less expensive sets of RISC chips that Samsung will be licensed to manufacture and sell to Hewlett-Packard and to other manufacturers. 

   Mr. Kay said Hewlett-Packard isn't trying to encourage clones of its machines -- a course being taken by Sun Microsystems. 
Rather, it is seeking partnerships that will give it a competitive advantage in some particular niche, such as the extreme low end or extreme high end of the workstation market. 
Last week, Hewlett-Packard announced an agreement with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan to develop jointly a very high-performance RISC chip set. 
The two companies' goal is to develop in about two years a machine with a speed of "considerably more" than 100 million instructions per second, more than five times faster than any desktop computer available today. 

   But Hewlett-Packard's RISC competitors are also forging alliances and planning far faster chips. 
Tomorrow, Sun Microsystems will announce an agreement with N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, under which Philips Components, a unit that is the largest semiconductor supplier in Europe, will develop RISC chips. 
Sun said the agreement "will have a formidable impact on the world-wide RISC market."

   Sun Microsystems Inc., which previously sold its line of technical workstations through its own direct sales force, said it is signing up outside resellers to help it broaden distribution. 

   The fast-growing computer company said it is recruiting so-called value added resellers with established experience selling computer equipment to customers engaged in computer-aided design, manufacturing, software engineering and publishing fields. 
Sun, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., will require the resellers to package Sun systems with third-party software or other enhancements before selling them to customers. 
The resellers also will be restricted to prescribed geographical areas. 

   Sun said it hopes the broader distribution will help the company sell its machines to commercial customers not currently served, such as more conventional businesses. 
Since being founded in 1982, Sun has sold nearly 50,000 technical workstations.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to unveil Monday a new
workstation at an unexpectedly low price, its strongest
weapon yet in the battle over the $9 billion market for
workstations and its first real threat to Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s dominance in the market.
   Hewlett's new machine, called the Model 705, will list for
$4,990 and run at nearly twice the speed of Sun's similarly
priced model, said industry officials familiar with the
machines. Hewlett said in December that it planned to
announce a machine for under $10,000, but gave no indication
that it planned to go head-to-head with Sun in low-priced
machines.

   "This is the first credible attack on Sun's stronghold,"
said Vicki Brown, an analyst at the research firm
International Data Corp. Sun, which grew rapidly in the 1980s
by selling low-cost machines, was the largest vendor of
workstations last year, with a 39% market share compared with
No. 2 Hewlett's 16%, according to Ms. Brown's preliminary
estimates.
   Hewlett's new machines could also put International
Business Machines Corp. in a weak spot. While Big Blue is
expected to unveil cheaper versions of its own RS/6000
workstations on Jan. 21, the new machines are expected to
list for $8,000 to $10,000. The Armonk, N.Y., company's new
machines, which were originally scheduled for unveiling last
year, have been plagued by delays.
   Hewlett also plans to announce a workstation called the
Model 710, a machine listing for just under $10,000 that can
use a color display and runs at about 50 Specmarks, a
trademarked measure that the industry uses to compare
computing speed. The low-cost Model 705, which has a
grayscale display and no disk drive, runs at 35 Specmarks,
about 75% faster than Sun's $4,995 Sparcstation ELC.
   The two machines fill a gap in Hewlett's line of
workstations that use chips based on technologies
collectively called reduced-instruction-set computing, or
RISC. RISC chips make for much faster computers than
conventional chips. Hewlett began selling a set of
higher-priced RISC workstations in March that have become
extremely popular and helped reverse a years-long slide in
the company's market share.
   While rivals such as Digital Equipment Corp. have come out
with under-$5,000 RISC machines, Hewlett has lacked one.
"There was clearly a hole we needed to fill and we've filled
it," said Gary Eichhorn, general manager at Hewlett's
workstation unit. Hewlett sees its low-end machines as
crucial to its strategy of breaking into markets for
business-use computers with its workstations, which are
traditionally used mainly by engineers. "It's really a
requirement to be in the commercial business," he said.
   While most industry analysts said Hewlett's new machines
pose a real threat to Sun, Hewlett's rivals said the Palo
Alto, Calif., company is plying for public-relations points
by touting its machine's speed while ignoring other factors
that really sell computers, such as availability of software
and the ability to add additional capabilities to machines.
   `We don't see this as a killer of any kind whatsoever,"
said Jeffrey Siegel, manager of core technologies at Sun,
Mountain View, Calif. Sun's low-end machines run far more
popular software applications and are more flexible, he said.
"The general masses in this price point aren't just
interested in mips and megaflops and Specmarks," he said.
   Dominic Ricchetti, a workstation-marketing consultant for
Digital Equipment, Maynard, Mass., conceded that Digital's
$3,995 RISC machines, unveiled in December, run at only half
the speed of Hewlett's new machines. But Digital's can
process color graphics, video, audio and voice datatasks that
customers increasingly demand but that Hewlett's can't
handle, he said. "Unless you're doing seismic analysis,
Specmarks don't always matter in real-life applications," he
said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Hewlett shares rose $2 to $58. In the
over-the-counter market, Sun shares fell 75 cents to $28.75.

   Sun's Anti-Clone Decree Sparks Anger,
   Charges of Hypocrisy on `Open Systems'

   Sun Microsystems Inc. has long proclaimed a gospel of
openness, urging computer makers to convert to Sun-designed
computer chips and to freely clone Sun's machines. Now irate
Sun allies say the Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker
isn't practicing what it preaches.
   At issue is a new Sun mandate that bars dealers of Sun
machines from carrying clones, machines that mimic Sun's.
Sun's new commandment, issued earlier this month, comes just
as clones of Sun's popular Sparcstation computers are
beginning to break into the market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sun's new decree, "is very hypocritical," says Tony
Siress, a director at Single Source, a San Jose, Calif.,
dealer of Sun machines that also carries clones made by
Taiwan's Tatung Science and Technology Inc.
   Mr. Siress and other dealers are steamed because Sun has
long promised not to block companies from cloning Sun's
workstations, high-performance computers often used by
engineers. Sun, despite its No. 1 share of the workstation
market last year, needs clones to help it reach its goal of
establishing its Sparc chip as the chip of choice in a broad
range of computer markets. Sun's aim is to replay the
personal-computer-market scenario, in which millions of
clones of International Business Machines Corp.'s PC made the
IBM design a de facto standard.
   The new Sun directive, which Sun says took effect April
20, prohibits Sun's so-called value-added-resellers --
authorized dealers in the U.S. that package Sun machines with
other software and hardware -- from selling all clones except
lap-top machines, which Sun doesn't make.
   Sun's clone ban has sparked righteous indignation in
trade-press editorials and brought gleeful reactions from
executives at Sun rivals such as Mips Computer Systems Inc.
of Sunnyvale, Calif. Mips president Robert Miller and others
have long labeled as false and misleading Sun's claim that it
espouses the new industry religion of "open systems," in
which computer makers build machines using freely available
standards.
   A Sun spokesman says Sun's clone veto is perfectly legal
and was enforced to prevent clone makers from stealing a free
ride off of Sun's large investment in its dealer channels,
which include about 400 value-added resellers, or VARs. "Just
because we have open systems doesn't mean we have to open our
channels up to competitive clone vendors," the spokesman
says.
   Some Sun dealers agree. Sun "has made a big investment in
training of VARs," says Patricia Shanks, president of Basis
Inc., an Emeryville, Calif., Sun reseller that specializes in
government contracts. "I think it's fair for them to try to
protect that investment."
   Sun's ban is "perfectly legitimate," as long as certain
conditions exist, says Laurence Popofsky, an antitrust lawyer
with the San Francisco firm Heller, Ehrman, White &amp;
McAuliffe. There must be, for example, other sales channels
available to clone makers, he says. Sun resellers say there
are thousands more non-Sun resellers to which clone makers
can turn.
   But legal or not, Sun's prohibition robs resellers of
potential customers who probably will now turn to cut-rate
dealers, says Victor Leventhal, president of CAD Solutions
Inc., a Sun reseller in San Jose, Calif. "I'm offended," says
Mr. Leventhal, who planned to sell Sun clones. "That's not
the gentlemanly way of doing it -- you win by the best
products, the best support, the best price; you don't win
because you limit distribution."
   Clone makers are equally piqued. The Sun ban is aimed at
hurting the several dozen clone makers Sun wooed into its
camp, says Mark Johnson, president of Opus Systems, a
Cupertino, Calif., Sun-clone maker. "We have a situation
where {Sun} has been overly zealous creating barriers for
their own channel," says Mr. Johnson, who adds that Opus is
"looking at legal options."
   The Sun move adds to already smoldering criticism among
allies and rivals alike that Sun is engaged in conflict of
interest, enticing computer makers to its Sparc-chip
technology on one hand and, on the other hand, selling
workstations that use leading-edge Sparc chips that aren't
yet available to clone makers.
   Sun, attempting to help stanch some such criticism, plans
to split off certain software and hardware-licensing
businesses into two subsidiaries. The new units, Sun argues,
will operate independently of the parent and should allay
fears that Sun unfairly favors its own machines.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The aging matriarch of Silicon Valley
has gotten a face lift, and apparently a new lease on life.
   Just last year, Hewlett-Packard Co. seemed to be doing
nothing right. It lost share in critical computer markets
after delaying new machines. Orders fell in older-line
businesses such as medical equipment, and a bloated work
force ate into already-thinning profit margins. HP's earnings
fell in each quarter, its stock slid to an eight-year nadir
and morale hit new lows.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Says executive vice president Lewis Platt: "People ranged
from being angry to demoralized."
   HP, once the quintessential Silicon Valley success story,
was suffering the classic symptoms of corporate gigantism:
slow decision making, sparring fiefdoms and an uncontrolled
cost structure. In the fast-moving Valley, HP increasingly
resembled a dinosaur watching fleet-footed mammals steal its
nest eggs.
   But in a startlingly short time, HP has begun a
metamorphosis. In a series of changes culminating in a major
reorganization last October, its chief executive officer,
John Young, has eliminated excessive layers of management and
put product development under strong leaders who have cut
through red tape. He has lumped computer-product groups
together according to the way they are sold, and reshuffled
the sales force to solve some acute marketing problems. HP
has gotten tougher about employee costs and is touting itself
head-to-head with arch rivals in its advertising.
   "We didn't want to be caught in the big-company mentality
where you can't get anything done . . . like companies I
can't mention that have blue products," says Mr. Young. "If I
had my life to live over again I would have done it earlier,
maybe as much as two years."
   The early returns: Since March, HP has fired off some
highly impressive new computers, including a checkbook-sized
personal computer and a workstation that set new speed
standards. Profits are up, and Friday HP stock closed at $56
-- more than double last November.
   HP's progress may provide an object lesson for other large
companies suffering from lethargy. While some factors dogging
HP's computer business were unique to the company, it faced
much the same bureaucracy and sloth -- like habits now
seemingly hobbling such companies as International Business
Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
   HP's revival also comes as a crucial battle is shaping up
among makers of personal computers and workstations. The
prize: dominance of the huge, growing desktop market. With
fast new workstations launched in March, HP poses a new
threat to IBM, DEC and Sun Microsystems Inc. HP is now
"better positioned than IBM or DEC to capitalize on the key
growth trends in computing in the 1990s," writes securities
analyst Robert Herwick of Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   HP's lead may be short-lived as rivals raise the ante with
faster machines. Its critics counter that the company lacks
the market share in PCs and workstations that it would need
to woo large numbers of new users. "I don't worry about HP,"
says Sun's president, Scott McNealy. "I worry about IBM and
Microsoft."
   Indeed, HP's biggest challenge in computers is likely to
come, several years hence, from potentially powerful
alliances that include IBM and Microsoft Corp. A recent
technical alliance among IBM, Apple Computer Inc. and
Motorola Inc. could siphon off HP customers, as could an
alliance that includes Microsoft, Compaq Computer Corp., Mips
Computer Systems Inc., DEC and others. And internally, HP is
still threatened by eroding profit margins as its revenue
increasingly comes from commodity-type products such as laser
printers sold by discount dealers.
   The malaise in HP's computer operations, and the company's
turnaround, hark back to a tiny one-car garage in a modest
Palo Alto neighborhood where David Packard and William
Hewlett in 1939 built HP's first gadget, a device called an
oscillator. Disney Studios soon bought one to help make movie
sound tracks, and sales took off. As HP grew and prospered,
its founders split off new product divisions as independent,
entrepreneurial bodies. The idea was to avoid creating a
monolithic giant, and instead duplicate the founders' success
over and over.
   This worked wonderfully in HP's old line of measurement
equipment, which didn't require much coordination between
divisions. Computers were different. By the late 1970s,
several HP divisions had independently created new computers,
what one executive calls "a hodgepodge of computer products
that were really not related well to each other." Computers
required a complex melding of disparate technologies,
components such as chips, disk drives and software.
   So in the early 1980s, HP took two critical steps: It
decided to make its computers conform to common standards,
and in 1984 it tried to place its disparate computer
operations in a single unit.
   The first move proved astute. By some accounts, HP now is
the world's biggest seller of systems based on Unix, an
industry software standard. But the second move proved a
long-term liability. Putting all computers into one
organization helped the company switch to a single
architecture, but the organization became mired in its own
complex decision-making process involving numerous meetings
among the many groups whose components went into a computer.
   The result was gridlock, as the company tried to build
computers by consensus instead of running computer-design
teams as entrepreneurial units with strong leaders. New
machines were regularly delayed in order to accommodate all
opinions.
   The 1988 launch of the Model 950, an important
minicomputer, was more than a year late because
operating-software decisions dragged on, says Peter
Rosenbladt, an executive involved in the program. "There was
always reason for another level of review, and we just became
mired in our own administrative process."
   Likewise, HP lagged in PCs. Its models were late,
high-priced "me-too" copies of IBM's PC. HP's share of the
world PC market was a dismal 1.2% in 1990 sales, according to
Dataquest Inc.
   Its 1989 acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. added new
burdens. Melding the two concerns went at a snail's pace.
   But the big blow came when Motorola delayed a
microprocessor that HP planned to use for a new generation of
workstations in 1990. That led to what Mr. Platt estimates
was $750 million in lost business. Its workstation-market
share, which hit 25% in 1989 after the Apollo acquisition,
fell to 23% of the $8.6 billion business last year, according
to International Data Corp., a market-research firm. Making
matters worse, some old-line sectors such as medical
equipment and calculators had slow revenue growth in 1990.
   HP's sales setup added to the bureaucratic morass. In its
1984 reorganization, HP had combined several sales forces
into a single group answering to the executive committee, not
to the people designing and making the products. So even the
simplest decision was sent up the management chain, sometimes
all the way to Mr. Young. To start a rebate program last
year, a group manager in the laser-printer operation needed
eight signatures, including those of two executive vice
presidents.
   Even if a division had a hot product, it couldn't count on
the sales force to push it. The printer group struggled last
year to persuade sales to exploit one of the fastest-growing
retail channels, supermarket-style "superstores." Raymond
Smelek, who runs HPs disk-drive works, was so irked by the
European sales force's failure to sell drives to European
companies that he considered closing the business.
   Moreover, HP failed to cut sales costs as revenue
increasingly came from lower-margin big-volume outlets. HP
spent 52.4% of revenue to sell and service equipment in the
1990 first quarter, up from 49.9% a year earlier.
   HP reached a low last year, when earnings fell 11% to $739
million from $829 million in 1989. The malaise wasn't
life-threatening. HP hasn't had losses, and many of its
old-line businesses, free of the bureaucracy snarling the
computer group, brought in steady if slow-growing profits.
Last year's sales were $13.2 billion, up 138% from 1980 and
20 times 1971 sales.
   Mr. Young concedes that by 1988, it was clear that HP's
computer operations had developed "a flawed organization
mechanism." That year, he tried to correct the flaws with a
reorganization he now calls "a half-step that didn't get the
job done." By mid-1990, HP's fortunes and morale had sunk so
low that Mr. Packard, the retired co-founder, went into the
office to look for solutions.
   But the solution -- last October's reorganization -- came
from Mr. Young. He had already tested some of its concepts.
In early 1990, he authorized a secret program to build a
workstation using technology known as Risc
(reduced-instruction-set computing), of which HP was an early
pioneer. The project, code-named Snakes, was to build a
machine that started at about $12,000 but was several times
faster than machines from Sun, IBM and others that were
gobbling market share.
   Mr. Young put a single manager, Dennis Georg, over it with
near-dictatorial power. Mr. Georg moved a team of engineers
into separate quarters. Unlike past workstation efforts,
decisions were made at low levels. Defying HP's consensus
tradition, a poster on Mr. Georg's office wall reads: "This
is not a Democracy."
   In March, after a year of development, HP unveiled its
Series 700 workstations, wowing computer-industry executives
and analysts. HP "has enough of a lead that it may take the
other guys a year or two to catch up," says Joseph Costello,
president of Cadence Design Systems Inc., which sells
software for Sun, HP and others.
   The second salvo came with a palm-top PC, the 95LX. The
$699 device contains Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software and can
receive data via satellite networks. The gadget got kudos
from industry dons such as Jean-Louis Gassee, Apple's former
chief product planner, who says the machine could create a
major new market and help HP "reassert itself in the PC
world." Orders exploded, forcing HP to build a new factory
line.
   Meanwhile, as part of the reorganization, Mr. Young split
the single sales group into many pieces that answer directly
to the product groups. And HP has reduced duplication. Until
last year, it made PCs at four sites; now it makes them at
one. Before the reorganization, laser printers were shipped
through hundreds of distribution centers around the world;
now there are seven. Last year some 13 groups in HP worked
independently on software to make circuit designing easier;
this year there is just one group. And that laser-printer
rebate program that required eight signatures would now only
require two.
   A victim of HP's makeover is its image -- inside and out
-- as a benevolent giant. Once satisfied with meek
advertising in trade journals, HP launched a barrage of print
ads for its new workstations in magazines such as U.S. News &amp;
World Report, chiding Sun with the message "What happened to
the old Sparc?" referring to Sun Microsystems's Sparcstation
computers.
   HP's turnaround has had its human costs. Last year, 3,000
jobs were cut. HP says it has never fired anyone for economic
reasons. It does, however, "excess" some people. An
"excessed" employee must find a job within HP in three
months, after which he or she is assigned one, sometimes at a
lower position or in a remote location.
   "It used to be you could count on the company to look
after your best interests," says an HP marketing staffer.
"Now there's just dread of the E-word."
   There are hazards for the new HP. Mr. Young must make sure
the company doesn't fall into what HP executives say is a
historical pattern -- failing to guard markets it has
pioneered. The company must turn out new versions of its
palm-top machine before companies such as Japan's Sharp Corp.
can turn out knockoffs. To maintain workstation momentum, it
must soon market a RISC workstation with a lower price tag --
about $5,000 -- in order to compete with Sun, says analyst
Vicki Brown of International Data Corp. "They're hamstrung
because they don't have one now," she says.
   Now that Mr. Young has begun to turn HP around, a big
question is who succeeds him. He's 59, and many think he may
retire within two years. Among prospects, many bets are on
Richard Hackborn, 54, who is credited with establishing and
defending HP's dominant 59% share of the laser printer
market. Refusing moves to the Palo Alto headquarters, Mr.
Hackborn works out of Boise, Idaho, where he now oversees all
mass-market products as an executive vice president, and
maintains a maverick image.
   Another candidate is Mr. Platt, 50, the executive vice
president who orchestrated the Apollo merger, which was
ultimately a success. He now heads the HP division making
workstations and minicomputers. If HP can keep its lead in
workstation performance and continue to trim costs, Mr. Platt
will earn much of the credit for bringing HP's computer
business out of its languor.
   HP dealers are certainly delighted with Mr. Platt's
organization. Last fall, Don Purkey, a workstation dealer in
San Jose, Calif., added Mips machines to his lineup when HP
didn't deliver competitive machines. Then the Series 700
workstations, from Mr. Platt's organization, arrived. Mr.
Purkey says he sold more HP machines in the next eight weeks
than in the prior 18 months. HP "is a company that seems to
have come out of its lethargy," he says.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Computer rivals unveil new
ranges - Louise Kehoe examines US advances in microprocessor technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment (DEC), the troubled US minicomputer manufacturer, today
opens a critical campaign to regain sales momentum and profitability with
the launch of a range of computers based on the controversial 'Alpha'
technology.
It hopes to leapfrog its principal competitors, including Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, with a range of seven computers from a Dollars 15,000
workstation to a multi-processor mainframe-class system.
The new Alpha chip - which processes information 64 bits at a time similar
to a supercomputer - is likely to make Digital the front runner.
But SUN and Hewlett-Packard are jostling to upstage DEC and one another as
they also today unveil powerful computers based upon the new generation of
high-performance reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor
chips of which Alpha is currently the most powerful example.
The price of the products the three companies are launching today range from
under Dollars 5,000 to well over Dollars 150,000 and span desktop PCs
through to data-centre mainframes.
Risc chips made their commercial debut in the mid-1980s. Unlike earlier
'complex instruction set' micro-processors, they process a limited number of
simple instructions very rapidly.
These devices have become the critical componentin an industry-wide
computer-power battle, challenging the role of conventional microprocessors
in the PC market and traditional computer architectures in mini-computers
and mainframes.
Computer workstations will be centre stage in today's product launches as
Sun, H-P and Digital battle for a larger share of the Dollars 10bn
workstation market, one of the fastest growing sectors of the computer
market. Originally used primarily for engineering and technical
applications, workstations are invading the office where they become
powerful desktop computers.
H-P, which pioneered the use of Risc microprocessors in mid-range computers,
will unveil a new range of workstations that double the speed of its current
models. Digital has to build a base of software applications to take full
advantage of the new Alpha design.
Initially, Alpha workstations will be aimed primarily at software
developers.
By next March, the company predicts there will be 'several hundred'
applications designed to run on the Alpha computers. Some 900 software
companies are working on over 1,600 applications programs for Alpha, Digital
claims.
Sun will today unveil what it claims is 'the world's least expensive colour
Risc workstation', a desktop computer that will sell in the US for Dollars
4,295 and outperform similarly priced personal computers.
Sun's new Sparc Classic also sets a target for Apple Computer's next
generation of personal computers based upon IBM's PC Power Risc
microprocessor.
Sun will launch its most powerful computer to date - a mainframe-class
system for data centre applications that will eventually incorporate up to
20 processor modules working together, and beginning next April, Sun will
ship systems with up to eight modules.
H-P aims to maintain its performance advantage over competitors with a range
of systems based on a new version of its Risc technology that set processing
speed records while maintaining software compatibility with existing models.

   MOUNTAINVIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., turning up
the heat on its competitors in the workstation business, is
set to unveil today its least expensive color computer.
   Aimed at engineers and scientists, the workstation will
cost about $8,000, industry observers said. It will run at
speeds faster than Sun's new $5,000 SCL computer but slower
than its $9,000 Sparcstation 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sun also is expected to disclose plans to sell some of its
products through personal-computer retailers for the first
time. The company initially has tapped three retailers for
the task, Tempe, Ariz.-based MicroAge Inc., Exton, Pa.-based
Intelligent Electronics Inc., and New York-based Nynex
Corp.'s retail arm.
   The move represents a continuation of Sun's efforts to
expand its distribution. It now sells its products directly
or through specialists in the sale of high-end systems.
   "Sun has a large-enough installed base that many customers
really just want to expand their networks by adding more
machines," said Seymour Merrin, a computer retail analyst in
Palo Alto, Calif. He said personal-computer retailers should
be able to handle those customers, giving Sun "a place on
store shelves that will be hard for competitors to take
away."

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. said it
will form two companies to develop and market certain
software and hardware products.
   Sun, a maker of computer workstations, said it will
operate the companies as wholly owned subsidiaries. One new
subsidiary, SunSoft Inc., will develop and market Unix
operating software and user interfaces written for Sun's
Sparc computer architecture. Edward J. Zander, formerly vice
president of marketing at Sun, was named president of
SunSoft.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The other new subsidiary, SunTech Enterprises Inc., will
manage so-called value-added products, such as Sun's printers
and software used to connect Sun machines to other computers.
Eric E. Schmidt, previously vice president of Sun's general
systems group, will be the unit's president.
   The new companies will be fully operational July 1, Sun
said.
   Sun President Scott G. McNealy said that splitting off the
businesses will help the company focus its various products
better in specific markets. Until now, he said, "we have had
too many products going out through one monolithic $3 billion
sales organization."
   The move is also meant to allay criticism in the industry
that Sun, by selling both machines and the software needed to
run them, has an unfair advantage against other computer
makers that hope to use Sun's Sparc architecture in "clone"
machines. But now, because the two new companies will be
responsible for their own profits and losses, analysts say
they wouldn't be inclined to give Sun early access to new
technologies. So, "clone manufacturers have a level playing
field," Mr. McNealy said.

   Makers of the high-speed computers called workstations,
long envious of the huge markets that personal computers
enjoy, are taking a stab at PC turf by signing up dealers
that sell PCs to businesses.
   The latest entries are Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola
Inc., each of which plans to announce this week that it has
agreed to sell workstations through mass-market dealer
MicroAge Inc. of Tempe, Ariz. Hewlett also plans to sell
through Intelligent Electronics of Exton, Pa., a dealer that,
as does MicroAge, sells Hewlett's PCs, laser printers and
calculators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both companies see their foray into the "dealer channel"
as a big step toward broadening the appeal of their
workstations beyond traditional markets among engineers and
technicians. They follow such companies as Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp., which have already signed
on such dealers.
   "Wide-scale distribution is a critical factor going
forward into the 1990s," said Douglas Kass, an analyst at
Dataquest Inc., a market research firm. "To have their
machines more commercially accepted, this is the best method
they could devise."
   Until now, Hewlett and Motorola have sold their
workstations through direct sales forces or so-called
value-added resellers, highly specialized dealers that tend
to sell complex packages of computer equipment, software and
service. Resellers are good at selling computer systems to
traditional technical markets, but lack extensive experience
and a broad clientele among businesses.
   That was a crucial point for Hewlett, which introduced a
super-fast workstation called the Series 700 in March that
was so unexpectedly popular that the Palo Alto, Calif.,
company still can't keep up with demand. Hewlett plans to
pitch the Series 700 and certain other workstations to
business users through selected MicroAge and Intelligent
stores beginning January 1992. "We needed to find broader
ways to get to customers," said Alan Arnette, who manages
sales channels for Hewlett's workstation division. "We'd be
self-limiting with existing channels."
   Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., will use MicroAge to sell a
type of workstation called a server, which businesses use to
tie desktop computers into networks and data bases. The
Motorola machines, called the MultiPersonal Series 8000, are
designed to allow Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines to
tap into networks that include machines from other computer
makers. MicroAge, with about 900 stores nationwide, is a big
seller of Macintosh systems.
   The target, said Wayne Sennett, general manager of
Motorola's Commercial Systems Division, is the large and
small businesses that the company couldn't cover before. "It
gives us national access for our products and a much broader
base of customers," he said.
   Hewlett-Packard and Motorola may be reacting to pressure
from rivals, analysts said. Sun Microsystems, Mountain View,
Calif., has sold workstations through MicroAge and
Intelligent since July 1990. Digital, Maynard, Mass., also
has begun using a dealer channel, putting pressure on Hewlett
and Motorola, said Mr. Kass of Dataquest. "They're playing
catch-up," said Mr. Kass, adding that Hewlett needs to sign
up more stores quickly to compete with rivals.

   Compaq, Microsoft Plan Industry Group
   To Create Standard for Workstations

   Compaq Computer Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are piecing
together an industry coalition to attack the fast-growing
workstation market now led by Sun Microsystems Inc.
   The group hopes to bring together at least five computer
companies, including Digital Equipment Corp., to create a new
standard design for workstations, said people familiar with
the discussions. Today's workstations -- more powerful than
personal computers and often used by scientists and engineers
-- lack the kind of de facto software standard that has made
personal computers so successful.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If it succeeds, the coalition could rob market share from
Sun and from companies such as Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc.,
which make the microprocessor chips that operate most of
today's desktop computers. But it will surely face powerful
opposition from Intel and Motorola, each of which plans to
unveil new super-chips this year and next.
   Because of the expected slowdown in personal computer
sales in 1991, Compaq and other personal computer makers have
been searching for a hot technology to lure buyers. And
workstations are expected to grow at a continued faster pace.
The industry group has already sketched out a preliminary
blueprint for their workstation, sources say, but isn't
expected to announce its plans for at least a month and won't
market the workstations for more than a year.
   If the group proceeds, Santa Cruz Operations Inc. would
develop crucial operating-system software and Microsoft would
provide a version of its popular Windows operating software.
The electronic brains of the workstation will be a powerful
microprocessor using reduced-instruction-set-computing. This
RISC technology allows chips to operate faster by reducing
their complexity. The favored candidate is the R4000 chip
announced earlier this month by its designer, Mips Computer
Systems Inc., industry experts say.
   A decision to standardize on the R4000 chip would be a
bonanza for Mips, of Sunnyvale, Calif. But the company's
president, Robert Miller, reached by phone Saturday,
cautioned that talk of Compaq and others agreeing to
standardize on the chip "is still speculative."
   Such a workstation alliance would be a blow to Sun, which
quickly became the biggest maker of workstations in the late
1980s, but now could be forced to compete with several strong
companies backing a single alternative design. People
familiar with the group's discussions said the Sun-designed
Sparc chip, which also employs RISC, has been ruled out
despite heavy pressure from Sun on Compaq to use the chip.
   Any coalition must contend with Intel's technological and
marketing might. By the time the industry alliance produces
its first machine, Intel will have announced its new 80586
chip and shipped faster versions of its 80486 chip. Both
Intel chips will adhere to existing industry standards.
   In 1988, Compaq and other companies banded together to
develop a PC standard known as Extended Industry Standard
Architecture. The so-called "Gang of Nine" successfully
developed and built EISA PCs to compete with the standard set
by International Business Machines Corp. known as the Micro
Channel Architecture.
   Compaq, Microsoft and Mips officials refused to comment on
the existence of the group.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. reported a
35% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter net income, citing record
shipments of its workstation computers and improved profit
margins.
   Sun's earnings contrast with the recent poor showings of
big personal-computer makers such as Compaq Computer Corp.
and attest to Sun's dominant grip on the fast-growing market
for workstations, the high-speed engineering computers that
are increasingly favored in business computing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sun said its net income for the quarter ended June 30 was
$66.4 million, or 63 cents a share, up from $49.1 million, or
51 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $942.5
million, up 35% from $700.1 million.
   Kevin Melia, Sun's chief financial officer, said in a
statement that the computer maker saw good results in the
U.S., Europe and the Pacific Rim. Sun shipped a record 49,000
machines in the quarter, he said.
   Sun, the world's biggest workstation seller, is scrabbling
with rivals such as Mips Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., and Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., in an
increasingly fierce battle to woo a broad range of
desktop-computer users who traditionally use PCs or terminals
tied to massive mainframe computers. Such competition has
begun trimming profit margins for workstations, much as price
wars have trimmed profits in PCs and plagued such companies
as Compaq, based in Houston, and International Business
Machines Corp. of Armonk, N.Y., with poor earnings.
   Despite increased competition at the low-priced end of the
workstation market, where Sun's biggest strength lies, Sun
reported that its operating-profit margin in the fourth
quarter was the highest in three years, 10.7%.
   Sun's fourth-quarter profit was close to most analysts'
estimates. Sun's stock closed at $32.25, down $1.875, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   However, Mr. Melia said Sun is "cautious" in its outlook
for the fiscal 1992 first half, in part because of the
"overall volatility of the industry." He warned investors not
to expect sequential gains in revenue or profit, especially
in its first quarter.
   For all of fiscal 1991, Sun reported a 71% jump in net
income to $190.3 million, or $1.85 a share, from $111.2
million, or $1.21 a share, in fiscal 1990. Revenue rose 31%
to $3.22 billion from $2.47 billion.
   Sun said it ended the fiscal year with $834 million in
cash.

   Sun's Success Doubly Sweet for Designer

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- It will be a long time before Sun
Microsystems Inc. again ignores the advice of Andreas
Bechtolsheim, its chief computer designer.
   Mr. Bechtolsheim, 34 years old, is a hero at Sun today
because he inspired its Sparcstation family of computers, on
the market for just a little more than a year and already
responsible for most of the company's business. Yet when Mr.
Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of Sun and the designer of its
earliest computers, first proposed to build the Sparcstation
in January 1987, Sun's senior executives looked askance at
the project. Miffed, Mr. Bechtolsheim came within a whisker
of quitting to launch his own company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sun is fortunate Mr. Bechtolsheim never left its fold.
"Andy saved Sun from a product standpoint," said David
Marquardt, a former member of Sun's board of directors.
   Mr. Bechtolsheim's rebirth as a visionary at Sun after a
period in eclipse illustrates how the process of bringing new
computers to market is rife with conflict, pitting designers
against marketers. No other senior Sun executive shared Mr.
Bechtolsheim's sense of urgency that Sun must push ahead of
competitiors in desktop computing.
   The West German native designed his first computer in 1980
while a graduate student at Stanford University. When he
couldn't sell the machine, a so-called workstation for
engineers and scientists, to a large computer maker, Mr.
Bechtolsheim founded Sun with software whiz Bill Joy and two
entrepreneurs, Vinod Khosla and Scott McNealy. Mr.
Bechtolsheim's machine was the company's first product.
   Within a few years, Sun and Apollo Computer Inc. were
leaders of the computer industry's fastest growing segment,
and Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., two
behemoths, were hot on the upstarts' heels. By 1987, Sun had
outraced Apollo and blunted the attacks of its larger
competitors.
   But Mr. Bechtolsheim saw a new threat to Sun's prosperity:
Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. After Mr. Jobs
left Apple in 1985, he formed Next Inc., vowing to build an
advanced desktop computer. At the time, Sun built computers
for individuals, but they were too large to rest on top of a
desk. Mr. Bechtolsheim urged Sun to build a powerful desktop
computer.
   The clarion call was a classic move for Mr. Bechtolsheim,
who relishes his role as a gadfly within Sun. He is "always
in here telling me how I'm running the business wrong," says
Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer.
   Officially Sun's vice president of technology, Mr.
Bechtolsheim doesn't formally oversee any engineers, budgets
or projects. "I can just tell people what I think," he says.
"I don't have to worry about protecting my budget. I don't
have a budget."
   Mr. Bechtolsheim, who held $26 million of Sun's stock when
the company first went public several years ago, sometimes
personally bankrolls his unofficial work at Sun. "One way
Andy gets action at Sun when the company won't back him is to
pay for it himself," says James J. Ludemann, a former Sun
engineer who worked on Sparcstation 1.
   This was one of those times. He began work on the machine
without official company support, spending $200,000 of his
own money on an office and design help. "I felt if Sun wasn't
going to let me do it, I was going to do it on my own," he
says.
   Soon afterward, Mr. Bechtolsheim distanced himself from
Sun, forming a new company called UniSun to bring his
computer to market. Mr. Khosla, then a member of Sun's board,
agreed to be its president. Finally, he offered Sun the right
to invest in the company and purchase it in the future.
   Sun seriously considered both possibilities. But Mr.
McNealy, fearing that Mr. Bechtolsheim's new venture might be
viewed as a new competitor, agreed to build Sparcstation 1.
   "Ultimately, we decided that if Sun couldn't do this
internally, we weren't worth our salt," says Curt Wozniak,
who was chosen to head a new division formed to house the
enterprise. In return, Mr. Bechtolsheim sold his fledgling
company to Sun for no gain.
   But the battle over Mr. Bechtolsheim's computer wasn't
over. To start with, Sun placed restrictions on which of its
engineers could join Mr. Bechtolsheim; he was allowed to hire
only those who said they would otherwise resign. And in the
months that followed, Mr. Bechtolsheim saw many of his ideas
criticized. A perfectionist -- for months he asked
houseguests to sit on his living room floor because he
couldn't find a couch he liked -- Mr. Bechtolsheim
ferociously defended his positions.
   For instance, when engineers on the project told him the
package containing the guts of Sparcstation 1 needed three
more millimeters in order to be manufactured, he refused to
widen it. "The company's culture was to build big boxes," he
says. "Mine wasn't going to be big." Finally Mr. Wozniak, the
division head, overruled Mr. Bechtolsheim. The three
millimeters were added.
   In April 1989, Sun introduced Sparcstation 1, a blazingly
fast machine, for a barebones price of $9,000. It quickly
became Sun's biggest seller. Since then, two more models have
been introduced, with the latest, unveiled this month, priced
at below $5,000.
   The Sparcstation family is now Sun's biggest seller. Sun
doesn't break out sales of the machines, but Vicki Brown, an
analyst at International Data Corp. said the company will
sell about 87,000 Sparcstations this year, comprising nearly
75% of its total unit sales of computers. Last year, Sun sold
35,000 Sparcstations, she said.
   Now Mr. Bechtolsheim is working on future Sparcstations:
smaller, more powerful machines utilizing advances in
semiconductors and miniaturization of other parts. He won't
be specific about his work, but says: "Our future computers
will be credit cards that you plug into your keyboard."

<HL> Compaq to Introduce Speedier Versions
Of Portables, Desktops Using 80386 Chip

<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to introduce next week speedier versions of its top-of-the-line portable and desktop computers. 

   The moves are Compaq's first product introductions since International Business Machines Corp. revamped its personal computer line in April and indicate that Compaq is following its tested strategy of trying to leapfrog IBM performance and concentrate on high-powered business computers. 

   At the same time, Compaq apparently hasn't moved to copy some of the deviations from the standard-setting 1981 IBM design that the computer giant made in April, a sign that the Houston-based company believes there is still a big and lucrative market for computers based on the earlier design. 
Compaq personal computers -- as well as those from other big makers like Tandy Corp., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., or Leading Edge Products Inc., for instance -- are built around the six-year-old IBM-PC design. 

   Industry sources expect Compaq to introduce an update of its Deskpro 386 computer using a faster version of the Intel Corp. 80386 microprocessor, known as a 386 chip, that powers the current Deskpro 386 models. 
The new version, also made by Intel, will operate 25% faster than previous 386 chips, which will speed up software programs run on the computer. 

   The microprocessor is the "brain" of the computer, which electronically performs the computer's operations. 
The Intel 386 chip is currently the most powerful microprocessor available for IBM-compatible computers. 

   Compaq officials wouldn't discuss the new products, which are expected to be introduced at a news conference the company has scheduled for next Tuesday in New York. 

   IBM announced in April a computer scheduled to be available in the fourth quarter with a 386 chip running at the same speed as Compaq's expected models. 
It isn't clear when Compaq's computers would reach stores, but Compaq models generally have hit the market within a few weeks after introduction. 
Sources familiar with the expected Compaq announcement weren't sure of the prices for the new models. 
Compaq's current Deskpro 386 models start at about $7,000 including a monitor; the price of the new machine is likely to be slighly higher. 

   The move to the faster chips is yet another step in the growth of personal computer power, as small desktop units increasingly take over tasks that only a few years ago required larger, free-standing minicomputers. 
The faster chip will make personal computers more attractive for use in architecture, design, or industrial management applications that use big, complicated software programs that bog down on less-powerful microcomputers. 

   That market has been served by workstation makers like Apollo Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
A workstation is a powerful personal computer for engineers and other professionals that is faster and has better graphics and communications links than office desktop computers. 

   One industry source, who asked not to be identified, said Compaq would offer as an option on the new models a graphics device that incorporates some workstation technology. 

   "It'll give (the Compaq entries) the amazing graphics that have so far been available only on workstations. 
And it should be better even than the improved graphics on the new IBM line," the source said. 

   Tim Bajarin, vice president of the Creative Strategies market research firm in Santa Clara, Calif., said, "Compaq's move will create a big collision with the workstation market. 
It's the first time you'll have a (personal computer) with workstation power." 

   While Compaq is improving its graphics to match advances made by IBM in its April line, sources said the Compaq models won't mimic the most important change in the new IBM computer -- the "microchannel," IBM's term for the pathway between the parts of the computer that actually perform computations and other parts like the memory, storage, modems and printers. 
The microchannel has caused some controversy in the computer industry because it smoothes out the pathway used in previous models, but at the cost of making obsolete some peripheral devices, such as modems, which worked with computers based on the 1981 design. 

   Compaq had said earlier this year it planned to introduce at least one computer that didn't copy the new pathway. 
In doing so next week, Compaq will be directly challenging IBM's new line in the big business market. 
That is a sign of Compaq's belief that buyers still aren't completely enamored of the new IBM line, and also, perhaps, that the new IBM computers are proving more difficult to copy both technically and legally than the old line. 

   Compaq is also expected to announce a version of its popular Portable III model with the 386 chip, a machine that has been expected for months. 
Compaq was the first major manufacturer to introduce a personal computer using the 386 last year, but it won't be the first to introduce a portable with the chip. 
Toshiba Corp. of Japan a few weeks ago introduced in Europe the first portable to use the 386 chip; the model isn't yet available in the U.S. IBM doesn't offer a portable with the 386 chip.

<TEXT>
   In early June, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s president, Scott McNealy, disclosed that the computer maker's eye-catching growth would end because of production and other problems. 
He said Sun might have a "slight loss" for the quarter, but the relentlessly upbeat executive said the miscues had been corrected and sales would quickly rebound. 

   Barely seven weeks later, however, the Mountain View, Calif., workstation maker conceded that its problems were worse than it had let on. 
In late July, Sun said its loss for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, could reach $26 million and acknowledged that it might not earn a profit in its current quarter as well. 

   What went wrong at Sun to alter the company's outlook? 
Three costly problems -- one new and two others the company failed to fix -- have left Sun reeling after seven years of sizzling growth. 

   First, the company failed to halt hiring quickly after sales slowed due to production, order and inventory problems. 
In the past five weeks, Sun has added nearly 1,000 workers, even as its top managers publicly vowed to "freeze" hiring of nonessential personnel. 
Sun employs about 10,000 people. 

   "Managers clung too long to the idea that they could clean things up right away," says Russ Crabs, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group, Stamford, Conn. 
"Because they anticipated a quick comeback, many rushed ahead, hiring a whole year's worth of people even before" the new fiscal year began. 

   Second, Sun's troubled information system -- its computerized record-keeping network -- is still trouble, even though the company said in June it had been resolved. 

   When Sun finally installed a new information system in April, after considering such a move for years, it didn't work. 
For several weeks, the company lost track of orders, inventory and other crucial aspects of its business. 
Sun has since corrected the worst problems, but the system still doesn't track inventory well or spit out certain key reports. 
As a result, to close the books on its June quarter, Sun must now finish some of the accounting work by hand, a spokeswoman says. 

   At about the same time that its information-system problems erupted, Sun introduced five major new computers. 
But delays in producing some of the machines prompted Sun to shift its sales strategy. 
"When the new products slipped a couple of weeks, we told the sales force to start pushing the old products again," Ed Zander, Sun's vice president of marketing, said in a June interview. 
As a result, Sun sold more of its older computers than expected early in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
"My forecast was wrong," Mr. Zander conceded. 

   Since late May, however, a bigger problem has emerged: Sun misjudged the popularity of its new, lower-priced Sparcstation 1, a fast desktop machine dubbed the "pizza box" because of its flat, compact design. 
Demand for the machine, which uses a Sun-designed microprocessor called Sparc, has outpaced initial forecasts by at least a factor of 10, causing a painful shortage of parts. 
Color monitors are in shortest supply, making it impossible for the company to fill many orders, an insider says. 

   Moreover, the popularity of the Sparc-based computers cannibalized sales of Sun computers using microprocessors made by Intel and Motorola to a greater degree than the company had expected, Mr. Crabs says. 
Even though the Sparc-based machines are in short supply, many consumers who might have bought the older machines have simply decided to wait for the new ones, hurting Sun's sales for now. 

   Sun's sales shortfall and feverish hiring means the company probably won't make money in the quarter ending Sept. 30. 
The prospect of two losing quarters in a row is prompting questions about the ability of Mr. McNealy, the chief executive, to control Sun's operations. 

   "McNealy's credibility obviously has suffered a great deal," says Robert Herwick, an analyst at the brokerage firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York. 
"There's been a loss of confidence in him." 

   What's worse for Sun, these miscalculations have coincided with decisions by several important Sun executives to leave the company. 
In June, for instance, chief financial officer Joseph Graziano jumped to rival Apple Computer Inc.; a major debt package unraveled in his wake. 
In April, Bernard Lacroute, the company's chief operating officer and Mr. McNealy's right-hand man, left the company out of frustration with Sun's "hectic pace" and lack of controls. 

   To push into new markets, Mr. McNealy had sponsored dozens of autonomous units within the company. 
Mr. Lacroute held this unwieldy organization together, but despite his efforts, by this year these overlapping fiefdoms had spawned confusion and waste. 
The most damaging consequence of this infighting emerged in sales, where different divisions battled one another for the same customers. 
"Our salesmen were confused, and our sales managers were confused," Mr. Zander said. 
"Our competition understood our own strategy better than we did." 

   Mr. Lacroute's departure prompted Mr. McNealy to reorganize the company, a move many inside Sun considered long overdue. 
Mr. Lacroute's responsibilities have been spread among a group of senior executives. 
Besides reducing the company's welter of development projects and streamlining sales and marketing, Sun also has targeted its customer-service operation for improvement. 

   Though these moves will strengthen Sun, some outsiders believe the company's top management is thin. 
"They need to find a replacement" for Mr. Lacroute, says Vinod Khosla, a Sun co-founder who is now a partner in the San Francisco venture-capital firm that Mr. Lacroute joined recently. 

   Sun, known for flouting tradition, has built a huge following among engineers and other "techie" professionals by selling high-performance machines designed to run smoothly in networks. 
After routing smaller competitors in the work-station market, Sun raced after the computer industry's giants with a bold strategy built around the Sparc microprocessor and an invitation to other manufacturers to "clone" its newest machines. 

   Now competitors, the target of Sun gibes for years, are eager to take advantage of the company's difficulties. 
Hewlett-Packard Co., which gained the lead in the market for technical workstations following its purchase of Apollo Computer Inc., recently mailed a "Sun survival kit" to Sun customers promising to "help you get out of the Sun." 
Digital Equipment Corp., also on the offensive, earlier this year introduced computers that are priced favorably against Sun's. 

   International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest computer maker, is expected to introduce this fall a new family of computers aimed at Sun's traditional customers. 
IBM has failed in its past attempts to crack the huge workstation market, but the new effort appears to be shaping up better. 

   "I'm worried about IBM," Mr. Khosla says. 
"It's going to be a strong announcement."

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro launches workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems aims to fend off mounting competition in the market for
computer workstations with a new range of products, to be introduced today.
The US computer company claims the new products will outperform all rivals.
Although Sun has maintained its lead in workstation sales, with over 25 per
cent of the Dollars 9bn world market, competitors including Hewlett-Packard
and International Business Machines have been gaining ground with
workstations that are significantly faster than Sun's products.
The new SparcStation 10 represents Sun's response to these higher
performance workstations. Two models, which Sun calls 'mid-range'
workstations, priced in the US at Dollars 18,500 to Dollars 25,000, will be
available in the third quarter of this year.
These will offer performance of 86m to 96m instructions a second and,
according to standard benchmarks, are comparable to similarly priced
workstations from H-P and IBM.
Later this year Sun will begin shipments of two high-end multiprocessor
models which outperform any workstations currently available, offering
processing speeds of 200m to over 400m instructions a second.
However, its competitors are not standing still, and Sun's claim that it can
offer 'the world's fastest desktop workstation' is expected to be
short-lived.
Competition among workstation manufacturers is intense. It is one of the few
segments of the computer market that has continued to grow strongly in spite
of economic recessions in leading markets.
The new Sun workstations will also provide users with a new way to merge
computer and telecommunications networks into a single system.

   Digital Equipment Corp. missed out on the
personal computer boom, but it hopes a big product announcement next
week will keep it abreast of the next wave in computing, desktop
workstations.
   Officials of the world's second biggest computer maker said
Wednesday they would introduce advanced workstations along with new
software and industry-standard personal computers in a major news
conference on Tuesday.
   ``It's probably the most significant desktop announcement we've
ever made,'' Donald McInnis, vice president of Digital's engineering
systems group, said in a telephone interview.
   Digital, the minicomputer giant based in Maynard, Mass., lost out
on billions of dollars in potential revenue from personal computers
because its founder and president, Kenneth Olsen, underestimated the
importance of the machines.
   The company kept building bigger and more powerful clusters of
minicomputers to compete with International Business Machines Corp.,
its bigger rival.
   Two previous attempts to catch up in the PC business failed: the
Rainbow, which did not run industry-standard software, and the
Vaxmate, which was too expensive. In its third attempt, Digital is
showing some humility by selling personal computers made for it by
Tandy Corp. according to Digital specifications.
   ``It's stating for the world that, `Yes, we're going to be in the
low end of the market,''' said Sonny Monosson, editor of the
Monosson Report on DEC and IBM.
   In the smaller but faster-growing workstation business, where
Digital already has the second biggest share of the world market
despite selling relatively slow machines, the company plans two
lines of fast and relatively cheap entries that should expand its
market share.
   Workstations are speedy desktop computers capable of displaying
intricate graphics and are used primarily by scientists, engineers
and other technical professionals.
   As a sign of the importance Digital attaches to workstations, the
company will break from tradition by selling one line incapable of
running programs written for its own Vax VMS operating system. The
new line will run only programs written for Ultrix, Digital's
version of the Unix operating system.
   For the new workstation, Digital had to choose between speed and
compatibility, and it chose speed by using a microprocessor supplied
by Mips Computer Systems Inc. that cannot handle VMS instructions.
   In the software area, Digital scored a major but little-noticed
victory last week when the Open Software Foundation, a standards
group, selected its technology as the standard for the means by
which programs appear in ``windows'' on a computer screen.
   Technology from Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. was
selected as the standard for the look and feel, or surface
trimmings, of the screen presentation. The decision on standards
should help simplify life for computer users and programmers.
   ``Until now we've had chaos and anarchy in terms of standards at
the desktop,'' McInnis said.
   The emphasis on desktop computers is a return to Digital's roots.
The company was founded in 1957 to build small computers better
suited to individual users than the powerful but complicated
mainframe computers dominant at the time.
   Analysts differed on how Digital's new workstations would fare
against the competition of Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer
Inc. and others.
   ``They overtook and passed Apollo in '88. With this new line of
products I think they're going to overtake Sun,'' said Jonathan
Cohler, editor-in-chief of Digital Review, an independent weekly
newspaper based in Boston.
   But Russell Crabs, an analyst for SoundView Financial Group in
Stamford, Conn., said the high-powered workstation will not take off
right away because there is not enough software written for
Digital's Ultrix.
   ``I think it's a defensive move, primarily against Sun,'' he said.
   Digital will trumpet the new products in a press conference in
Littleton, Mass., and other presentations that day and the next in
Santa Clara, Calif.; London; Paris; Copenhagen, Denmark; Sydney,
Australia; and Tokyo.

<HEAD>Apple Introduces Big Mac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said Apple Computer's new,
more powerful and speedier Macintosh model shows the company is
continuing its strategy of selling expensive computers with high
margins.
   That's despite recent criticism from Wall Street and some of its
customers that the company desperately needs a low-cost, updated
version of its original Macintosh.
   Apple executives promised to soon get cheaper models of the
enormously popular machines on the market.
   ``We will have new compact machines at lower price points and
modular machines at lower price points,'' said Randy Battat,
Apple's vice president for marketing, said at a news conference on
Monday. He refused to say when those machines will be available.
   Apple's new Macintosh IIfx is based on a speedy version of
Motorola Inc.'s 68030 microprocessor and is twice as fast as the
Macintosh IIci introduced six months ago. It will enable the
company to compete better in the $6 billion a year market for
workstations, which are powerful and fast desktop computers.
   The IIfx costs from $9,696 to $11,497, nearly $3,000 more than
the IIci and in the same range as competing workstations.
   While the new machine won't satisfy critics who blame the
company's recent financial woes on the absence of a cheap
Macintosh, Apple responded to the call for lower prices by
announcing decreases of up to 50 percent on its memory expansion
kits for almost all Macintosh systems, as well as LaserWriter
printers.
   Apple also introduced video display cards that improve graphic
display and will compete with those sold by other companies; a new
release of its implementation of the Unix operating system; and new
training programs for customers and authorized Apple resellers.
   The Macintosh IIfx is available in three configurations _ with a
single floppy disk drive, with an 80-megabyte hard disk drive, or
with a 160-megabyte drive. Each comes with 4 megabytes of internal
memory, and the machine is expandable to 8 megabytes.
   Many of the people who developed the new system originally
worked at such rival workstation makers as Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Apollo Computer.
   William Lempesis, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose
market research company, said the new machine shows that Apple is
continuing efforts to better position itself for a greater share of
the high-end corporate computer market, where profits are higher.
   In the last year, Apple's sales have declined, but the company
made more money per machine, indicating a switch in sales toward
higher-priced, more profitable units.
   Lempesis said the Macintosh IIfx will compete with workstations
used for such technical work as computer-aided design.
   ``One of the objections to the Mac has been pure speed and
processing power,'' said Jennifer Aurand, a spokeswoman for
Versacad Corp., a software maker in Huntington Beach, adding that
the new machine ``allows the Mac to compete more directly with
(Sun's) Sparcstation.''
   The new version of Unix also is likely to assist Apple in the
workstation area. Federal government agencies and universities
generally use computers that run the Unix operating system.
   The Macintosh IIfx won a generally enthusiastic response among
industry observers, but the company is still criticized for a lack
of cheap products that has resulted in a loss of sales to companies
selling less expensive IBM-PC compatibles.
   Apple slashed prices by up to 17 percent on its low-end
computers in February after laying off 400 people because of slow
sales. In the first quarter, which ended Dec. 29, profit fell 11
percent to $124.8 million. Revenue grew just 6 percent to $1.49
billion.
   Apple's troubles recently led to a major management shakeup,
including the resignation of two division presidents, and
appointment of a chief operating officer.

<HEAD>Sun Unveils New Workstations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc. on Monday introduced
four new workstations that it called faster and more sophisticated
machines which form the high end of the company's desktop line.
   The new SPARCstation 2 computers are almost twice as fast as the
SPARCstation 1 models introduced last year, Sun said. They range
from a $14,995 monochrome-display workstation to a $49,985
color-screen version offering three-dimensional modeling and
animation.
   Workstations are high-powered personal computers aimed primarily
at scientists, engineers and others who need great computing
capacity or high-quality graphics.
   ``The addition of the SPARCstation 2 line with its great
graphics simply makes this environment better for technical
professionals who have real performance needs,'' said Scott
McNealy, president and chief executive officer of the Mountain
View-based company.
   Like its predecessor, the SPARCstation 2 uses the popular Unix
operating system and Open Look graphical interface and packages the
electronics in a small ``pizza box'' enclosure. But while the
earlier models offered from 8 to 48 megabytes of memory, the new
ones offer 16 to 96 megabytes. A megabyte is roughly a million
characters of information.
   The new line also includes a low-cost file server, a computer
that acts as the hub of a network of desktop machines.
   The new products are being offered in addition to the $4,995
SPARCstation SLC and $7,995 IPC desktops introduced last year.

<HL> Digital Equipment Corp. Slashes Prices
On Workstations in Bid to Gain in Market

   Digital Equipment Corp. slashed prices on its computer workstations in an effort to gain ground in a fast-growing market where its results have been weak. 

   The price cuts surprised analysts and competitors, and put Digital in the unusual position of being the price leader in the market. 
Analysts said Digital's move is likely to blunt the success of workstation makers Sun Microsystems Inc., of Mountain View, Calif., and Apollo Computer Corp., of Chelmsford, Mass. -- at least temporarily. 

   The lower-priced Digital workstations -- powerful personal computers used by engineers for designing products and writing software -- may also compete with higher-priced personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and others. 

   "I was flabbergasted. 
This is the announcement of the year," said John Logan, an analyst with Yankee Group in Boston. 
"They have announced the Apollo-killer and laid the groundwork for competing with (IBM's) PS-2" he added. 

   Digital said it will start selling a new monochrome workstation for $4,600 in December. 
It also said it will cut the price on its existing VAXstation 2000 unit with a 19-inch monochrome monitor 48%, to $5,400 from $10,500. 
Currently, the lowest priced workstation is a Sun model with a 19-inch monochrome monitor priced at $4,900. 
In addition, Digital will begin selling in December a color VAXstation 2000 for $7,900, well below the price of any competing products. 
"It's caught everybody off guard. 
You don't expect Digital to be as price competitive as this," said Vicki Brown, a market researcher with International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. 

   Digital has been highly successful in the past 18 months because all its computers communicate easily and share the same software. 
In the past, its executives have said it didn't need to compete on price because customers were willing to pay for the communications. 
However, with about a 10% share, it has been a weak fourth in the workstation market behind Sun, Apollo and Hewlett Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. 

   "We made a decision to break the price barrier. 
We wanted to show we're . . . serious," said Christopher Reed, a marketing manager with Digital. 

   Market leaders Sun and Apollo downplayed the announcement. 
Edward Zander, vice president, marketing, at Apollo noted that Digital didn't announce any new technology. 
"With what we have today and what we have coming in the future, we will be able to maintain a good healthy position," he said. 

   John Hime, director of product marketing at Sun said his company's success "really did wake up the sleeping elephant." 
However, he said that Sun's lowest-priced workstation is faster than Digital's lowest-priced product and predicted Digital's new products will sell mostly to established Digital customers. 

   On Monday, word of the price cuts apparently leaked out and both Apollo and Sun stock prices fell sharply. 
However, they rebounded yesterday. 
In national over-the-counter trading Sun shares closed at $40.875, up $2.375 and Apollo shares rose 62.5 cents to $21.875. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Digital closed at $166.125, up 50 cents a share. 

   Mark Stahlman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said he thinks the newly priced products "will be enormously successful" but predicted that neither Sun nor Apollo will be hurt, because Digital will broaden the market. 
He said both of the smaller companies are expected to introduce new products this summer. 

   Digital said it expects the lower-priced workstations will be popular in non-engineering fields such as desktop publishing, banking, insurance and security trading as well as in the traditional engineering markets. 
All the workstation vendors have been broadening their sales efforts. 
Sun, in particular, has said it sees its workstations as alternatives to personal computers, and yesterday Digital echoed the same theme. 

   In contrast to personal computers, workstations can do many different tasks at once, communicate easily in networks with other workstations and display much sharper text and graphics on larger display screens. 
However, the newest personal computers based on the Intel Corp. 80386 microprocessor and other advanced chips have workstation-like speed and late next year they will gain many of the other workstation capabilities in multitasking and graphics. 

   The personal computer market is much larger than the workstation market. 
Some nine million personal computers have been sold, compared with about 150,000 workstations. 
The workstation market, however, amounted to $1.5 billion last year and is expected to grow almost 50% this year, according to Dataquest, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the computer industry.

   The mercurial market for computer workstations is about to
undergo another burst of change.
   Most of the change will come because International
Business Machines Corp. is beginning to flex its muscles as
it starts to deliver the impressive line of workstations it
announced early this year. Market researchers expect IBM to
go from essentially no market share in workstations to some
15% to 20% of the market over the next year and a half. And
that market share obviously must come out of somebody else's
hide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Sun Microsystems Inc. has reasserted
itself as the leader of the market for workstations, powerful
machines used mainly by engineers. Hewlett-Packard Co. has
faltered. Digital Equipment Corp. has improved its product
line but confused its marketing message. Next Inc., Steve
Jobs' much-publicized new company, has failed to make any
impact. And several Japanese companies are preparing to enter
the market with clones of Sun's systems.
   "This is sort of like the battle of Waterloo," says
Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., a
market-research firm that focuses on workstations. "The Suns
and Digitals and HPs have fought themselves to a standstill,
and now we hear drums in the distance. Sun is slowly winning,
but now IBM is thundering on the scene with fresh troops and
seemingly inexhaustible resources."
   The market is important mainly because it is growing so
fast: Gartner Group Inc., a market-research firm, estimates
that the world-wide workstation market will nearly quadruple
to $19 billion in 1994 from $5 billion this year.
   But it is also important because part of that growth may
come at the expense of personal computers and minicomputers.
That is a matter of particular concern to companies such as
IBM that sell a wide range of machines.
   Workstations -- essentially very powerful personal
computers with high-resolution monitors -- are starting to
head down into the traditional personal-computer price range.
They are beginning to run similar software and eventually may
be sold through personal-computer dealers. Workstations are
also delivering so much computing power that, as software
becomes widely available over the next couple of years, they
could move out of their traditional preserve in engineering
departments and into the mainstream business applications
that minicomputers now handle.
   IBM, having failed in two prior efforts to crack the
workstation market, seems to have finally gotten things
right. The machines it began shipping in May are more
powerful than those of its major competitors and are priced
rather aggressively.
   The major hurdle was expected to be getting software
developers to make enough application packages available, a
problem that has hobbled Digital Equipment. And there have
been extensive reports in the trade press of bugs in IBM's
operating system, which would make application development
difficult. But software developers and consultants say that
the bugs have been stamped out almost entirely and that
application software will be available on time. IBM says that
by the end of the year it plans to have 1,500 major
application software packages and 7,000 total applications
available -- on a par with the numbers Sun can claim.
   Bill Filip, a senior marketing executive in IBM's
workstation operation, said orders have been at "the high end
of expectations." He pointed to an International Data Corp.
study that predicted IBM would sell 15,000 units this year
and said the total would be "substantially more than that."
He said IBM has already decided to expand its production
capacity. Until recently, someone ordering a machine would be
told he might not get it until next May.
   The biggest problem that IBM still faces is that it
doesn't have a low-end machine. Its line starts at $13,000
for a stripped-down machine, while Sun, for instance, starts
at around $5,000. IBM says it will correct that problem,
though probably not for almost a year. IBM executives also
indicated the machine's price might be $1,500 to $3,000
higher than Sun's.
   IBM also faces the standard problem in the workstation
market: The machines' power doubles every 12 to 18 months, so
companies must run hard just to stand still.
   Noting that other companies have announced fast machines
since the IBM announcement in February, Louise Rehling, a
senior vice president at software developer SPSS Inc., says
that IBM still has a lead in power, "but it's getting
narrower."
   Vicki Brown, an analyst at International Data, says she
expects IBM to be neck and neck with Digital Equipment for
the No. 2 spot by the end of next year -- with Sun still the
leader and HP slipping to fourth.
   HP has had problems partly for reasons beyond its control:
It had announced products based on the Motorola Inc. 68040
processor, but Motorola was more than nine months late in
shipping those chips. HP also has had trouble integrating its
product lines with those of Apollo Computer Inc., which it
acquired last year. Those problems are expected to keep a
damper on HP's workstation sales for the next year or so,
too.
   Competitors and consultants say Digital Equipment has
strengthened its product line considerably, overcoming some
earlier problems. But they add that Digital's marketing
message is muddled because it offers two types of machines:
those that use its own operating systems and those that use
Unix.
   Workstations typically use the Unix operating system,
which runs on hardware made by numerous companies, making it
easy to move Unix-based application software from one
company's computers to another's. But Digital has made its
mark by selling systems that use its proprietary operating
systems, which lock customers into buying Digital hardware
because their applications won't run on anyone else's boxes.
   More than most old-line companies, Digital has been slow
to make the move to Unix. Despite a growing Unix business,
Digital's blunt president, Ken Olsen, has labeled some claims
about the system "snake oil" and trashed its prospects at
every opportunity.
   Sun has rebounded from some problems last year and seems
to be in the best position for the next year or so. It has a
strong product line, including the new Sparcstations that
start at $5,000. It also has a clean marketing message, given
that it is only in the workstation market and doesn't have
any conflicting interests.
   Sun faces a wild card over the next year and a half
because it has licensed others to make Sparcstation clones
and could face an influx of Japanese competitors. Sun,
however, dismisses the potential for trouble. Chief Executive
Scott McNealy agrees that IBM lost market share to companies
that cloned its personal computers but says that IBM
generates personal-computer revenue of maybe $13 billion a
year. "Hurt me with that problem," Mr. McNealy says.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. is lining up on
the side of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Sun Microsystems
Inc. in a high-stakes competition over a critical piece of computer
software.
   Matsushita said Monday that a close U.S. business ally has
concluded a licensing agreement with AT&amp;T and Sun to use their
Sparc computer architecture in a new engineering workstation.
   The Sparc design is tailored for use with AT&amp;T's latest version
of Unix. Unix is a base layer of software that allows programs to
run on a variety of computer models.
   The version of Unix developed by AT&amp;T with Sun has been
challenged by an industry group that says the popular software
should not be controlled by one company. That group includes such
powerhouses as International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Matsushita's decision to jump into the fast-growing workstation
market ends an effective 24-year absence from the field of
high-powered computers. Workstations are fast computers with strong
graphics capabilities that are typically used by scientists and
engineers.
   Matsushita said it plans to build the central processing unit
for the workstations designed by Solbourne Computer Inc. of
Longmont, Colo., and Solbourne would supply the rest of the
workstation's components and sell it under its own brand name in
the United States.
   Matsushita owns 52 percent of Solbourne, according to Mike
Kitadeya, a spokesman for Matsushita's U.S. subsidiary.
   Solbourne hopes to put a workstation on sale in the United
States early next year, Kitadeya said.
   Matsushita's decision to enter the fray over Unix, though
indirectly for the time being, on the side of Sparc could affect
the opinions of other Japanese electronics makers.

Concern Is Expected to Add
Competitive Computers
To Its Engineering Line

   Digital Equipment Corp. is expected next week to unveil low-priced computers and workstations in its popular VAX line that will make the company much more competitive with other makers of engineering computers. 

   Industry analysts and competitors said they expect the new systems to have base prices around $10,000 -- half the price of Maynard, Mass.-based Digital's current low-priced systems -- and to compete head-to-head with low-priced workstations made by Apollo Computer Inc., Chelmsford, Mass., and Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif. 

   The new products, which Digital insiders said were originally supposed to be ready last year, are expected to help Digital recapture market share in the low-priced end of the engineering and scientific market. 
"They'll be able to position themselves much more competitively. 
They won't be technological leaders, but they don't have to be," said Vicki Brown, a market researcher at International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. 
She said many customers who use larger Digital systems also will buy the low-priced VAX computers because they can run the same software the larger systems do. 

   Digital said it has scheduled a news conference in Boston for next Tuesday to announce "two new major additions to" its VAX line. 
The company declined further comment. 

   Digital Review, a biweekly Boston-based publication that covers the company, will report in its Monday edition that Digital will announce a workstation called the VAXstation 2000 with a base price of $10,125, without a disk storage device. 
The publication also will report that the other computer is the MicroVAX 2000, a system that can be used by as many as four users at separate terminals, with a base price of $9,100. 

   Analysts and consultants say the VAXstation 2000 is a particularly important product for Digital because the company has been struggling in the booming market for engineering workstations. 
Engineers use workstations, which display drawings well, as personal computers for designing products and writing software. 

   International Data estimates the overall workstation market nearly doubled in size last year to $1.4 billion. 
The leaders in the overall market, according to another research firm, Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif., are Apollo, with a 26% share; Sun, with 23%, and Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., with 17%. 
Dataquest said Digital had only 10% of the market last year. 

   Apollo, which founded the workstation market, said its lowest-priced product, the $9,900 model DN3000, "is one of the most successful products in the computer industry." 
A spokesman added that the company doesn't think the Digital introduction will hurt. 
"A lot of customers have been aware of this Digital product. 
If there was going to be an impact, we would have felt it by now." 

   Fast-growing Sun Microsystems makes a diskless workstation, the 3/50, with a base price of $7,900. 
Cynthia Typaldos, a marketing manager, said, "We haven't seen any impact." 
She said reports of Digital's system costing $10,000 indicate it won't be competitive in price, "and I suspect it won't in performance either." 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Digital shares closed at $150.375, up $3.75. 
In national over-the-counter trading, Apollo closed at $20.50, down $1.125, and Sun Microsystems closed at $28.75, down $1.125. 

   One analyst who studies Digital for another computer company said the product "will sell to their customer base. 
Whether they steal people from Sun and Apollo depends on" the customer. 

   While other workstation makers design computers that use standard chips from Motorola Corp. or Intel Corp., Digital custom designs its own chips so the computers will run Digital's proprietary software. 
It is important for Digital to be able to sell low-priced hardware that runs VAX programs or its customers might be tempted to switch. 

   Jonathan Cohler, editor of Digital Review, said he thinks Digital also tried to price the VAXstation 2000 low enough to forestall inroads into its market by the expected new generation of workstations that are being designed around Intel's 80386 chip. 
International Business Machines Corp., among many others, is expected to pursue the engineering-workstation market with a computer based on that chip.

   Sun Microsystems Inc. and Cray Research Inc. plan to
announce today a technology agreement that could make the two
computer concerns a bigger force in the rapidly growing
market for "parallel" supercomputers that chain together
scores of processor chips.
   Industry officials familiar with the plans said Cray has
agreed to use Sun's Sparc architecture in future
supercomputers, probably in machines that chain together many
microprocessors, or "brain" chips, in a format often called
parallel supercomputing. Whatever machines come from the
deal, however, aren't likely to be on the market for several
years, industry analysts said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Sun spokeswoman acknowledged that Sun plans a press
conference with Cray to announce a "technology-sharing and
marketing agreement," but wouldn't provide details. A Cray
spokesman would only say it will announce a "strategic
relationship" soon.
   For Cray, the Sun's Sparc chips offer a weapon against
upstart supercomputer makers, such as Intel Corp., of Santa
Clara, Calif., and Thinking Machines Corp., of Cambridge,
Mass., which are quickly gaining market share with their
parallel machines. Thinking Machines earlier agreed to use
Sparc chips in future parallel machines, which are popular
among scientists and financial institutions because the
machines are far less expensive than traditional
supercomputers.
   "Cray needs to be in this marketplace and they know it,
and the way to get there is to work with Sun," said Debra
Goldfarb, an analyst at International Data Corp., a research
concern.
   Industry analysts say sales of Cray's older line machines,
which can use only a few processors at once, have remained
flat for several years. Intel, by contrast, says sales of its
supercomputers, which can connect as many as 4,000 internal
processors, have doubled every year since 1989.
   Cray's endorsement of Sparc gives Sun, Mountain View,
Calif., a high-profile ally in its effort to woo a wide range
of computer makers to its architecture. Sun's Sparc has been
the dominant chip in low-end workstation computers used by
engineers, but the company is trying to penetrate higher-end
markets.
   The Cray relationship will also give Sun the technology it
needs to speed up its Sparc chip, which has been overshadowed
recently by faster chips from such companies as
Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines
Corp., said Ms. Goldfarb. The deal isn't likely to affect as
yet unannounced plans by Cray to use a Digital Equipment
Corp. chip in some future machines, she added.
   Cray's announcement of its support of Sparc comes as the
Minneapolis company completes its acquisition of Floating
Point Systems Inc., a Beaverton, Ore., supercomputer maker
that unsuccessfully attempted to extract itself from
financial troubles by developing parallel machines with Sparc
chips.

   DEBRA GOLDFARB, an analyst at International Data Corp.,
believes Cray Research Inc.'s agreement to use Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s microchips could help Cray penetrate the
market for "moderately parallel" supercomputers that chain
together a number of so-called Risc chips but won't
necessarily involve development of "massively parallel"
machines. In the Jan. 22 edition, her position was
misconstrued.

<HEAD>Company Unveils 3-D Technology for Personal Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silicon Graphics Corp. on Tuesday unveiled
technology the company said will give personal computer users
access to three-dimensional graphics previously available only on
expensive computer workstations.
   The company announced circuit boards that fit inside
International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible personal
computers that use Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 and 80486
microprocessors.
   The boards, called Irisvision, allow users to move and alter 3-D
color images on the screen and instantly see the changes they make,
a feature important to scientists and engineers.
   ``Irisvision redefines and sets new standards for personal
computer graphics,'' said Edward R. McCracken, Silicon Graphics'
president and chief executive officer. ``(It) will change the way
people use PCs for design and animation.''
   Both the boards and about 15 software packages to take advantage
of them will be available in January, the company said. More than
20 software developers are writing applications for Irisvision, it
added.
   Silicon Graphics is known for its 3-D graphics computers,
ranging from workstations starting at $10,000 to supercomputers
costing $500,000. The boards are the first product the fast-growing
9-year-old Mountain View company has produced for the personal
computer market.
   They also come as competitors, notably Sun Microsystems Inc.,
try to woo personal computer users with cheaper workstations.
   Irisvision boards will cost $3,500 to $5,000. The company hopes
to sell 25,000 boards during the first year.
   ``They give you the same graphics performance as our Personal
Iris product line (of workstations),'' said company spokeswoman
Jill Grossman of computers that range from $10,000 to about
$25,000.
   The boards allow personal computer users to put together a
system to do sophisticated graphics for as little as $7,000,
McCracken said. They should cut into Sun's strategy of offering
workstations ranging from $5,000 to $9,000, he said.
   But a spokesman for Sun, also based in Mountain View, said his
company's computers offer more than sophisticated graphics,
including networking capability and data processing not available
on personal computers.
   Robert Herwick, an analyst with the San Francisco brokerage
Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., said the development of software for the
new boards would help ensure their success.
   He also said the boards should increase demand for Silicon
Graphics' workstations, since those who like the new technology may
want to move up to the company's low-end workstations.
   Silicon Graphics posted a $32 million profit on sales of $420
million in the fiscal year ended June 30. It had $11.5 in profit on
$264 million in sales in the previous year.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., gaining
another ally in its battle to win the hearts of
desktop-computer users in businesses, said a Xerox Corp. unit
agreed to provide its popular desktop-publishing software for
Sun's machines.
   The unit, Ventura Software Inc., agreed to produce its
Ventura Publisher for Sun's Sparcstation computers, Sun said.
Sun also announced a new software-distribution program called
Catalyst CDware in which Sun will provide users with a
compact disk filled with application software.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Ventura agreement is a boon for Sun, which is trying
to broaden the use of its machines to business offices from
the more traditional engineering uses where Sun's machines
are extremely popular. To do that, Sun machines need a
critical mass of the kind of software businesses use: word
processor, spreadsheet, data base and desktop publishing
programs, for example.
   Sun has already won some big-time allies in Lotus
Development Corp., Wordperfect Corp. and Ashton-Tate Co.,
which have agreed to tailor their programs to Sun machines.

   Digital Equipment Corp. plans to announce some new
engineering workstations tomorrow, but they won't surpass the
raw speed of the RS-6000 workstations unveiled by
International Business Machines Corp. in February.
   Digital is touting features of its new workstations other
than speed. Donald Gaubatz, group manager for workstations,
said that DEC's new products will have better graphics than
IBM and will fit on a desktop, unlike most rival workstations
that sit in consoles beside the desk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nevertheless, "This announcement is less than one might
want," said Peter Kastner, an analyst with Aberdeen Group,
Boston.
   The workstation market has been a game of corporate
leapfrog in recent years as Digital, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard Co. surpassed each other in producing the
latest "hot box." Digital's expected failure to top IBM shows
what a dramatic speed improvement IBM achieved when it
re-entered the market. The scientists, engineers and
programmers who use workstations demand fast machines to run
complex software and display detailed graphics.
   Digital has had a hard time in the market for fast
workstations that use reduced-instruction-set-computing, or
RISC, architecture and the UNIX operating system. Most of
Digital's workstation sales are VAXstations that run its
proprietary operating system.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that Digital's new
workstations will be based on Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s
R-3000 microprocessor. He said that Digital engineers have
coaxed performance of 24 million instructions per second, or
MIPS, an industry measure of performance. That far outspeeds
Digital's Decstation 2100 workstation, which processes 14
MIPS. But it falls short of IBM's new Powerstation 320, which
runs at 27 MIPS, and its more expensive Powerstation 530,
which runs at 34.5 MIPS.
   Analysts generally expect Digital to price its newest
model at less than $20,000, depending on features. Mr.
Gaubatz said the workstation will be competitively priced.
   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said that
he thinks Digital's new workstation will run faster than
IBM's workstations in commercial applications, although it
will be slower for many scientific jobs involving heavy
computation.
   Digital entered the RISC-workstation market early last
year, breaking with tradition by buying a microprocessor
design from another company, Mips Computer, rather than
building its own design. Digital's goal was to get into the
market fast. However, analysts say that its entries, the
DECstation family, have gotten off to a slow start. Terry
Shannon, who follows Digital for International Data Corp.,
Framingham, Mass., estimates that Digital sold only about
6,000 of the DECstations last year compared with about 60,000
VAXstations.
   Domenic J. LaCava, Digital's vice president in charge of
workstations, noted that the DECstation sales are "all
incremental business," that otherwise would have gone to UNIX
competitors such as Sun Microsystems. But Digital's version
of UNIX is sufficiently different from others that many UNIX
programs have yet to be translated, or "ported" in industry
jargon, to the DECstations. Digital is pushing developers to
port their software.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that, "the first year was a
signal that Digital was serious about the UNIX market. The
features in the new product make up for all the shortfalls of
the current model."

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp.'s Cadam Inc., branching out into
new territory, said Tuesday it was making its design software
available on workstations made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Apollo
Computer Inc.
   The step should help Cadam's sales while making it easier for
engineers to work together on designs even if they use different
models of computers, said Eric Keller, senior research analyst at
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
   Cadam Professional software is for designing objects ranging from
cars to printed circuit boards.
   Cadam said a feature called Power Link will make it easy for
designs that are developed on a Sun workstation to be moved to an
Apollo workstation, and vice versa.
   General Motors Corp. demanded that exchangeability in 1987 when
it authorized Cadam as one of its two suppliers of computer-aided
design software, along with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Eventually other computers, including International Business
Machines Corp.'s RT-PC, will be included in Power Link, Cadam said.
The RT-PC was the first workstation to run Cadam Professional. Cadam
also makes design software that runs on mainframes and personal
computers.

   IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations
today that experts say should help the computer giant win a stake
in an important market it never has mastered.
   ``The opportunity is big _ it's growing at over 30 percent a
year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM,'' President Jack
D. Kuehler told a news conference.
   Kuehler said the new workstations, designed for business users,
``outperform the newest and best that our competitors offer.''
   International Business Machines Corp. aides showed reporters
nine high-performance workstations and computer file-servers, with
prices ranging from $13,000 to more than $74,000.
   Industry analysts say the machines are impressive for their
operating speed and features and should be received favorably by
engineers, their target market.
   Workstations are desktop machines that are much more powerful
than personal computers. Some even match the power of mainframes.
They are used for such processing-intensive tasks as computer
modeling of new products.
   While the workstation market is a small segment of the overall
computer industry, it is among the fastest-growing, and uses for
the machines are expanding.
   IBM introduced a workstation line several years ago, the RT
line, but it captured less than 3 percent of market. Experts
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced.
   The workstation field is dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   The new IBM machines, like the workstations they replace, are
based on a version of the Unix operating system, the underlying
software that directs basic computer functions.
   Unix, developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., is
becoming the computer industry standard, allowing machines from
different manufacturers to be linked together.
   Until now, IBM had not wholeheartedly embraced Unix, preferring
its own proprietary operating systems instead. The fact that the
workstations are Unix-based shows IBM is serious about this market,
analysts say.
   Like the older IBM workstations, the new models also are based
on reduced-instruction-set computing technology, or RISC, which
simplifies the circuitry of a computer's central processor to
increase speed and offer cost savings. The powerful machines are
expected to offer color, 3-D graphics capability.
   Analysts say one factor in the success of the new line, called
the RISC System 6000, will be the availability of applications
software, or the programs that provide the actual uses of a
computer, such as engineering modeling.
   Though the machines are Unix-based, IBM uses its own version of
Unix, called AIX, that is not compatible with Unix applications
programs written for other companies' machines. That means programs
must be rewritten for the IBM workstations.
   IBM has been working with software companies for some time to
develop programs for the new machines.

   Companies are closing plants and firing tens of thousands
of workers. There is excess capacity around the world.
Industry leaders face years of restructuring.
   The steel industry in the 1970s? Yup. And the computer
industry in the 1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Computers, except for the biggest machines, are becoming
commodities that customers buy as cheaply as possible. And
the computer industry will never be the same again. While the
recession has aggravated the problems, analysts predict that
commodity pricing will keep plaguing the companies until
their number has dropped considerably.
   "Profitability of every sector of the computer industry
now is under pressure or becoming nonexistent," says Barry
Bosak, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. And
with the companies constantly leapfrogging each other with
machines that run the same software, the industry is
condemned to ceaseless innovation, price cutting and product
cycles that are nasty, brutish and short.
   The ever-more-rapid pace of innovation is demonstrated by
Sun Microsystems Inc., which has spurred many of the changes.
Sun introduced eight generations of computers in its 9
1/2-year existence. In the old days, product cycles took
three to five years, and companies had plenty of time to
recoup research and development costs.
   Instead of having twice the profit margin on sales of
average industrial companies, as they did in 1984, computer
companies now have returns 20% lower than average, McKinsey &amp;
Co. consultants calculate. Over the past five years, profit
margins for the 11 largest U.S. computer companies averaged
just 6.5%; in the previous five years, they averaged 11.5%,
Technology Research Corp. says.
   All that dismays a business that just 10 years ago -- when
Americans were smarting at their loss of leadership in steel
and machine tools -- was hailed as the model of U.S.
industrial success.
   The changes are good for buyers, which enjoy the fruits of
innovation and the ability to play computer makers off
against one another to get lower prices. Software makers,
which can easily differentiate their products, benefit
because their programs run on a wider variety of computers.
The business of helping companies integrate various kinds of
computers into networks is growing.
   Meanwhile, virtually every computer maker is trying to
reinvent itself. Wang Laboratories Inc. is offering to sell
International Business Machines Corp. computers instead of
its own models. Prime Computer Inc. is moving to become a
computerized-design software company instead of a hardware
maker. Digital Equipment Corp. is relying on outside
companies to develop both the operating system and the
microprocessor brains of its high-powered workstations. And
IBM is asking archrival Apple Computer Inc. for help in
designing its future desktop systems.
   These companies have ample reason to change. With prices
falling so fast, Pier Carlo Falotti, who heads Digital's big
European operations, complains, "We have to sell 70% more
{unit} volume every year just to stay even in revenue."
Companies such as IBM, Digital and Compaq Computer Inc., long
accustomed to double-digit sales growth and profit margins,
now often report shrinking computer revenue and paper-thin
profits -- and huge restructuring charges.
   For workers, computer companies once offered lifetime
jobs, generous benefits and ample opportunity for advancement
in a white-collar environment. Today, even profitable
companies are laying people off, and money-losers such as
Unisys Corp. and Wang are cutting staffs to barely half their
peak levels. Computer industry jobs fell 4.3% last year to
424,000 -- the 1980 total.
   But the computer industry differs from others in the U.S.
that turned from leaders to laggards: Vicious competition
among U.S. companies themselves, rather than from foreign
rivals, is causing most of the pain. And compared with other
U.S. industries, "the computer industry is five years ahead
of the curve in realizing it has to hold onto market share,"
says Ira Magaziner, a Providence, R.I., consultant.
   But holding on is likely to produce skimpier and skimpier
profits. For one thing, the ability to build computer
hardware, once scarce, has become commonplace. Hundreds of
companies are building powerful personal computers, not just
in Silicon Valley and Japan but also in Korea and Taiwan --
and North Sioux City, S.D.
   The PC has become a commodity because Intel Corp., which
makes microprocessors (the PC's brains), and Microsoft Inc.,
which makes the operating system software, are in effect
monopolies that sell their technologies to practically all
comers. The companies that assemble PCs from those components
press suppliers of all other parts -- screens and disk drives
and memory chips -- to slash prices and push technology.
   The upshot: With most buyers looking primarily at price,
IBM and Compaq, the high-priced market leaders, had to slash
their PC prices earlier this year.
   Now, the commodity battlefront is moving up to more
expensive, sophisticated workstations that use the UNIX
operating system. UNIX, developed by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., has become the standard because it works on
all the computer makers' fastest workstations. At one time,
customers were afraid to mix in computers that were
incompatible with a proprietary operating system, and they
waited patiently until their vendor caught up with
competitors. Now, every time a workstation maker leapfrogs
the competition with higher speed or a lower price, many
customers switch.
   Although various versions of UNIX differ a bit, they are
similar enough that software vendors can make applications
for one system work with another. Parametric Technology
Corp., of Waltham, Mass., brings out new versions of its
computerized design software on seven different UNIX
workstations within a few weeks every time it upgrades the
product.
   "We're enjoying the workstation wars today.
`Can-you-top-this?' goes on constantly," says Roger Herman of
ITT Corp.'s aerospace communications division, a user of
Parametric's Pro Engineer. At Northern Telecom's Ottawa
engineering department, Marc Dulude, a manager, comments, "At
any particular time, the choice comes down to
price-performance." Engineers designing everything from
switch cabinets to telephone handsets used to work on
terminals hooked to IBM mainframes. Three years ago, Northern
switched to Pro Engineer on workstations and now buys from
Sun, Silicon Graphics Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Makers of bigger computers haven't reached the commodity
stage. Companies with IBM mainframes find it expensive to
rewrite all their software to run on UNIX-based mainframes.
But software developers are writing more and more software
programs for the UNIX operating system, and some customers
are tempted by cheaper standard systems. And makers of
UNIX-based computers that create one powerful system from
several microprocessors offer equal power at a fraction of
mainframe prices.
   Two years ago, Richard Cascio, chief financial officer at
JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla., decided to replace his
two-year-old, $2 million IBM 3090 mainframe with six Data
General Corp. UNIX-based Aviion computers costing a total of
$700,000. "In the first year, the pure bottom-line savings
are $800,000," he says. In addition to the cost benefits, the
Aviion systems are easier to use and can be kept running more
consistently, he says.
   In terms of pricing pressure, "it's devastating," says
John Levinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "Chief
information officers, and more importantly the board room,
now understand that open systems are a lot cheaper and more
flexible and don't lock you in." Makers of proprietary
midrange and mainframe computers have to discount list prices
sharply to keep existing customers.
   The pressures on mainframes will worsen as engineers
figure out how to use multiprocessor UNIX computers to run
huge data bases such as airline reservation systems and big
banks' customer accounts. Oracle Corp., the leading
independent maker of data-base software, recently
demonstrated that it could run its data base on a $1.7
million nCUBE Corp. supercomputer at about 1,000 transactions
per second -- half the speed of the fastest online
transaction-processing software on one of IBM's biggest, $20
million mainframes. Moreover, Oracle's data base is more
flexible and easier to program.
   The lower prices for computer systems have badly hurt
proprietary-system makers accustomed to high gross margins.
   Russell Planitzer, chairman of Prime Computer, longingly
recalls the days when a mid-range Prime 50 costing $300,000
carried a 65% gross margin-profit before taxes, interest and
overhead as a percentage of price. If a salesman sold four of
them a year, Prime had a gross profit of $780,000. "The
equivalent performance in our UNIX family has a $150,000
price tag and a 40% gross margin," Mr. Planitzer says. To
bring in a $780,000 gross profit, the salesman would have to
sell 13 systems a year, Mr. Planitzer calculates.
   Some PC companies have adjusted to the new economics by
avoiding the expense of big sales forces, holding down R&amp;D
spending to less than half the computer-industry norm of 10%,
and accepting after-tax profit margins under 5%. But for
larger systems, most companies believe that R&amp;D spending must
remain high, and they cut costs elsewhere.
   Analysts say Sun Microsystems is virtually the only big
maker of more-powerful computers that has a business model
fully geared to the commodity hardware business. Sun, founded
in 1981, embraced the UNIX standard from the beginning,
buying almost all parts rather than designing and building
them itself. It also didn't set up multiple factories. "We
built this company from scratch using a business model that
didn't involve much infrastructure or employees," says
Lawrence W. Hambly, Sun's vice president of marketing.
   Sun accepts a profit margin well under historic industry
norms. In its recently completed fourth quarter, Sun's profit
margin hit a three-year high of 7% -- anemic by the standards
of the industry winners in the 1970s. But because investment
has been so low, its return on equity was 18%, well above
average for U.S. companies. With 12,500 workers and $3.2
billion in sales, Sun has one-quarter the sales and one-tenth
the employees that Digital does. "Sun invented the new
economics of computing," says an admiring Mr. Planitzer.
   Most older vendors are trying to copy Sun's approach for
their industry-standard products: buying parts from
suppliers, cutting costs and producing new products annually.
Most hope to continue selling high-profit proprietary systems
to existing customers for a few more years. However, almost
all of them are holding onto those customers by promising to
help them switch to UNIX in the future.
   Only a few companies will have the economies of scale to
build UNIX computers profitably. The rest will buy them and
add software or hardware enhancements before reselling them,
as Prime and Wang already do. Steven Milunovich, an analyst
at First Boston Corp., predicts that by the end of the
decade, there will be only three European computer makers,
four or five Japanese makers and four to six large U.S.
manufacturers. "I can't help but be negative about the whole
hardware industry," he says.
   Besides helping computer buyers, all that change spells
opportunity for consulting and integration companies such as
the consulting arm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and General
Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems subsidiary. And many
software companies are doing well; their customers don't want
to switch software once they have learned one program. In
fact, most hardware companies are trying to build their own
software and integration-services business; Digital gets
about 40% of its revenue from those areas.
   For most hardware companies, the changes are crippling,
although a few have made the adjustment. Analysts say
Hewlett-Packard and AT&amp;T's NCR Corp. have stayed profitable
while moving to UNIX. Data General has stabilized its
proprietary-system sales while expanding its UNIX business.
   The industry's giants, IBM and Digital Equipment, are
betting that customers will continue to want their
proprietary mid-range and mainframe computers and will pay
high prices for them. This fall, IBM is introducing a new
line of mainframes that many analysts predict will strengthen
its profits. But Mr. Milunovich says a First Boston survey
finds some customers loath to buy big mainframes.
   Digital Equipment has taken a different course: It buys
either its PC and workstation lines or their core technology
from others. This year, it helped set up a group of
companies, including microprocessor designer MIPS Computer
Systems Inc. and PC maker Compaq, that will rely on
MIPS-designed microprocessors and a version of UNIX concocted
by Santa Cruz Operations Inc., a software firm, for their
future UNIX workstations.

<HL> Apollo Cuts Prices
On Workstations,
Matching Its Rivals

   Apollo Computer Inc. slashed prices on its cheapest computer workstations and introduced a new mid-range model that it said is priced lower than competing machines of similar speed. 

   The move, announced here, matches recent price cuts by Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo's rivals. 
There has been a dogfight in the workstation field lately, with Apollo, Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., and Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., leapfrogging each other with lower prices and new technology. 
Workstations are powerful personal computers used by engineers and other professionals for design and financial modeling tasks. 

   Apollo "is the winner for this week," said John Logan, an analyst with Boston-based Yankee Group, a market research firm. 
However, many analysts said they are worried that lowered prices for Apollo's best-selling Domain Series 3000 will hurt its profit margins. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apollo shares closed at $20.75, up 25 cents. 

   Apollo cut the price on the Domain Series 3000 with a 19-inch monochrome screen 50% to $5,990 from $11,900. 
It said it will introduce a $4,990 Domain 3000 with a 15-inch screen in December. 

   The cuts make Apollo's low-end systems competitive with those from Sun, which started the latest round of price cuts in March, and Digital, which cut prices two weeks ago. 
Thomas A. Vanderslice, chairman and president of Apollo, said the price actions weren't prompted by the competitors moves, but instead reflected a longtime plan to cut costs by redesigning the systems. 
He said the action "won't have any impact on profitability." 

   Edward Zander, vice president, marketing, said that Apollo didn't loose ground in the low end of the market after the Sun cuts, but said "there were 90 days when we had to explain to customers why" Sun prices were so much lower. 
Apollo said it had warned customers who resell Apollo computers to reduce their inventories in preparation for a price cut. 

   Apollo's new mid-range workstation, the Domain Series 4000, has a base price of $13,900 for a monochrome model without a disk drive. 
Apollo said it can handle four million instructions per second or MIPS, a common measure of computer speed. 
It will be available in August. 

   Marc G. Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said Apollo had "better hope the 3000 backlog migrates to the 4000," or revenue will drop sharply because of the price cuts on the 3000. 
Mr. Vanderslice said that Apollo expects about 30% to 40% of the companies that had planned to buy the 3000 will buy the more powerful 4000 instead. 

   Apollo said a 4000 machine configured to match archrival Sun's 3/260 model would cost $17,900, compared with $33,900 for the Sun workstation. 
However, John Hime, a product marketing manager at Sun, said the Apollo comparison is misleading. 
He said the Apollo 4000 would slow down when it had to move information from its central processor to the monitor or to disk memory. 
"It looks like a very unbalanced system," he said. 

   Analysts said they don't expect further price cuts at the low end among workstation makers unless increasingly powerful personal computers start cutting into their core engineering markets. 
International Business Machines Corp.'s new PS/2 personal computers, for example, are potential competitors in the workstation market. 
Workstations are more powerful, display sharper pictures and are easier to link together in networks than most personal computers. 
However, companies are likely to continue adding features. 

   Next week Sun is expected to introduce a very powerful workstation that runs at 10 MIPS using a reduced instruction set or RISC architecture, a design that enables greater speed. 
Later this year Digital is expected to introduce a more powerful version of its VAX-station computer that runs at more than three MIPS. 
And Apollo insiders are starting to drop hints about a desktop workstation to be introduced next year that runs in the 25 MIPS range.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., continuing
to pound its competitors in the computer workstation
business, posted fiscal fourth-quarter net of $49.1 million,
or 51 cents a share. It had a loss of $20.3 million, or 25
cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
   The company's earnings for the quarter ended June 30
exceeded expectations of even the most optimistic analysts
and provided fresh evidence that Sun's grip on the
workstation market is tightening. In recent months, Sun has
outpaced competitors, most notably Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Digital Equipment Corp., with new models that are faster and
less expensive than prior products.

   Revenue for the fourth quarter was $700.1 million, a 62%
rise from the $431.2 million reported a year ago. "Their star
is rising," said Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist.
   For the year, Sun's revenue totaled $2.47 billion, a 40%
increase over its 1989 fiscal year. Net income rose 83% to
$111.2 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $60.8
million, or 76 cents a share, in the prior year.
   Bill Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, attributed
the company's rapid sales growth to new distribution
arrangements that give Sun an entre into commercial and
office markets. Traditionally, the company has sold its
machines to technicians and scientists.
   "We see a broad diversity of firms coming to us and major
industries are buying our systems, it's just not engineers
and scientists anymore," he said.
   Mr. Raduchel cited a recent order by the New Zealand
Inland Revenue Department, which wants Sun machines for an
office automation project.
   Sun's quarterly results amid a slow growth period for
computer sales presents a bright financial picture for
company. It ended the year with $394 million in cash,
compared with $54 million a year ago.
   The fourth-quarter loss posted by Sun a year ago was the
only such loss for the company since it went public in March
1986.
