   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It sounds like something Disney would do, build
replicas of the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs for the tourists to look
at. But the people responsible for preserving Egypt's antiquities
say they have little choice. The real tombs are deteriorating
rapidly in the crush of the tourist flow. To close them would mean
losing the tourist trade.

   Egypt's pharaohs built their tombs to last
an eternity. But some of the most magnificent of the royal resting
places may not make it much past the 20th century.
   A main spoiler is man.
   Drawn by ancient Egypt's aura of mystery, thousands of visitors
parade every day through the once off-limits world of dead pharaohs
and their queens. They violate tomb chambers designed by ancient
priests for one mummy-filled coffin.
   With that in mind, a Swiss group has come up with a
multimillion-dollar answer: Custom-built tombs, clustered in a new
``valley of death,'' especially groomed to accommodate mass
tourism.
   Give the tourists what they've come to see, but in facsimile.
   ``If you want to have your tourists and save your tombs,
building replicas is the only answer,'' says Theodor Abt, president
of the Zurich-based Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt.
   ``We haven't a minute to lose,'' he says. ``Each time I come I'm
shocked to see what has happened. The world can't afford to give up
something so unique and precious.''
   Egyptian officials agree. In March they approved a proposal from
the society to duplicate two tombs: the tiny, gold-painted chamber
of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamen, and the larger, beautifully
decorated tomb of Nefertari, powerful chief queen of warrior
Pharaoh Ramses II.
   They are among more than 400 tombs stretching for five miles
along the Nile River's western bank opposite ancient Thebes, now
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Saving both tombs has been a great worry for antiquities
officials.
   ``It's a wonderful project, the answer we've been searching
for,'' says Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization. ``Now we can save our tombs without depriving our
tourists of their beauty.
   ``And if we have to close one or more of them for restoration
and conservation, we won't feel so bad about it.''
   Tawfik says tourists still will be allowed in the original
tombs, but he expects the replicas ``to deflect masses away from
endangered ones.''
   Not even Egypt's mightiest kings foresaw that their secret
burial chambers, carved in valleys so desolate they were unfit for
the living, one day would attract a tourist boom of monumental
proportions.
   But they do. Each day 3,000 to 5,000 people crowd the land of
the dead, even in the horrendous heat of Upper Egypt's summer.
Humidity, dust and salt brought into the tombs by sweaty bodies and
the touch of countless fingers are eating away at the timeless but
fragile decorations on their walls.
   The only sure way to save them would be politically and
economically explosive: bar tour groups from the most popular
tombs. Most visitors travel in groups, carried across the Nile by
special launch and bused to the various valleys of death. Only
about two dozen tombs are open to the public at any one time.
   Permanently closing the tombs is an option that's hardly figured
in years of debate over monument conservation because of a national
push to bring ever more tourists into Egypt.
   Some 2 million visitors now pump $2 billion a year into Egypt's
dollar-starved economy. The government predicts the number of
tourists will double within the next few years.
   For antiquities officials, whose job is to protect relics,
copying the best and most endangered tombs offers an acceptable
alternative to locking doors. It leaves room for tourist expansion.
   Also, the replicas will be tombs with a difference. Tourists
will see them as the ancients did, not the faded and damaged
chambers visited today. And with modern touches: one-way traffic
and air conditioning.
   Abt, a Zurich psychoanalyst, says engineers have selected the
bone-dry, fault-filled Western Valley for the reproductions, lying
just over the hills from the tombs of Tutankhamen and fellow
pharaohs.
   The Western Valley was chosen because of ``its beauty and
emptiness. The sacred atmosphere so important to early tomb
builders is something we don't have to duplicate,'' Abt says.
``It's already there.''
   The West Bank's most popular tourist spot is the Valley of the
Kings, where New Kingdom rulers were buried for 500 years.
   But ancient architects originally gave the royal nod to the
Western Valley, where they placed the mummy of pharaoh Amenophis
III in 1353 B.C. The area later was abandoned in favor of valleys
to the east and south.
   Abt says plans call for the first cluster of duplicate tombs to
include, in addition to Tutankhamen's and Nefertari's, those of the
warrior Pharaoh Tuthmosis III and two non-royals, Sennedjem, a
court official, and labor foreman Inherkhau.
   He estimates each cluster will cost as much as $80 million,
raised in a campaign like the 1960s UNESCO drive that saved the
monuments of Abu Simbel and other Nubian sites south of Luxor.
   Abt says duplicate tombs will be low-slung, built to disguise
their locations and decorated by Egyptians using techniques of the
ancients. Originally, tombs were dug into the landscape to hide
them from would-be robbers after the riches accompanying the dead
pharaoh into the afterlife.
   ``Each cluster will be built against the mountains and covered
with rocks to give the same feeling of antiquity as the ancient
tombs,'' Abt says.
   To ensure that each tomb will be correct historically, the Swiss
group's 50 international members include as vice president an
authority on the West Bank burial grounds, Basel professor Erik
Hornung.
   While new in Egypt, building replicas to save antiquities is not
a new concept.
   French officials closed the Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963
after 100,000 visitors surged in the previous year to see the
monuments' prehistoric paintings. In 1983 a facsimile was opened,
which today awes 400,000 visitors annually.
   Spain currently is seeking money to reproduce 12,000-year-old
wall paintings of bison and horses at its Altamira Caves. The
tourist crush in the main cave became so great in 1982 that it too
had to be closed.

   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

   Artisans are re-creating one of the great
moments of archaeology on an island south of Cairo.
   On Nov. 26, 1922, English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the
tomb of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamun and found a glittering world of
delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather-light fans and decorated
coffins of solid gold.
   The riches he discovered amazed the world.
   Now, 68 years after Carter peered into the small tomb in
southern Egypt, the artisans are fashioning Tut's netherworld once
again, working from photographs and other records. The replicas of
Tut's treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them.
   Twenty-two artists, sculptors, engineers and university students
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the Pharaohs.
   They are halfway through their assignment: to duplicate his
four-chambered tomb and 1,000 of the 1,703 Tut objects in the
Egyptian Museum, as they were left by priests 3,313 years ago and
the robbers who came later.
   Ever-watchful jackals, goddesses in sleek gowns, open-mouthed
lions and even the boy Pharaoh himself, out for a walk in thonged
sandals, cram the bustling workshop on Jacob's Island.
   A year from now, every day on Jacob's Island will be Nov. 26,
1922.
   Until then, people wanting to marvel at King Tut's storied world
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades: the
treasure hoard in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and his tomb, with the
mummy, 450 miles to the south, in the Valley of the Kings.
   ``It's the wonder that we must produce in our tomb - the shock,
which you don't feel when you see the objects away from the tomb,''
said Mahmoud Mabrouk, a sculptor and art professor who directs the
Jacob's Island project.
   ``We work as a team, just as the ancients did,'' he said.
   Novices think Tut's treasures were all of solid gold. There was
plenty of that, but there also were objects of wood, silver and
other metals, alabaster, ivory, leopard skins, leather, pottery and
gemstones.
   Decisions on whether to replicate individual items, big or
small, were based on whether they were important to history or to
art knowledge.
   The project is costing 1 million Egyptian pounds (almost
$360,000) and is the brainchild of former diplomat Hassan Ragab, an
entrepreneur who revived Egypt's extinct papyrus industry.
   In 1985 he opened his Pharaonic Village on Jacob's Island, where
tourists come to view life from the days of King Tut, but without
the boy Pharaoh himself.
   ``Dr. Ragab asked me to create a full-scale tomb with exact
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as Carter
felt it,'' Mabrouk said. ``The tomb was no problem, but nobody knew
how to make the objects. Everybody I talked with told me to refuse
the offer.''
   Mabrouk, who advises an international committee working to save
the Sphinx, said he accepted the challenge for two reasons.
   ``First, I wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist,'' he
said. ``What kind of people were these, to create things so
beautiful, but things that would never be seen by the living?
   ``Today, we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates
us. Not these artists. Their creations were locked up with Tut.''
   The second reason harks back to Mabrouk's childhood.
   ``I was 12 when my brother and I saw the Tut collection in the
museum,'' he said. ``We were so happy, but we were sad. The objects
were beautiful, but nobody knew anything about them.''
   ``I want Egyptian youth to look back on their history with a
sense of pride, a sense of identity. It's an Arab problem that
Egyptians turn their backs on anything about the Pharaohs.''
   Mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of Tut relics. ``We
had to start with the simplest items,'' he said. ``Once we mastered
the techniques, we could tackle the most difficult.''
   Reproduction has been made more difficult because objects in the
museum must be examined from behind glass and many Tut objects are
locked in storerooms. Books contain conflicting information, and
Mabrouk said many of Carter's notes are inaccurate.
   Even lowly artifacts proved tricky. A simple pair of sandals
took three months to reproduce.
   Many of the 50 alabaster items from the tomb were lovingly
worked with exquisite designs. Alabaster posed one of the toughest
challenges.
   ``We spent six months working in alabaster factories outside the
Valley of the Kings, just to see how to use the stone,'' Mabrouk
said. ``We finally made three simple vases, but even that took a
month.''
   Still to come are Tutankhamun's gold death mask and the
elaborately inlaid gold sarcophagus.
   ``Sometimes you just have to compromise,'' Mabrouk said. ``We'll
use gold-plated copper instead of gold, but the effect will be the
same.''

CAPISTRANO VALLEY GETS HEALTHY IN VICTORY OVER CORONA DEL MAR

Corona del Mar High School's basketball team displayed an impressive amount of 
tenacity Friday night in its nonleague game against Capistrano Valley, the 
county's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Was it good enough for an upset? Not quite. Not with Capistrano Valley forward 
Scott McCorkle back in the lineup after missing one game because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle scored a game-high 38 points -- including 16 in the first half -- to 
lead Capistrano Valley to a 66-53 victory at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
For Capistrano Valley (8-2), the victory should help to boost the team's 
confidence for its next venture: the King Cotton tournament, one of the most 
prestigious in the nation, Dec. 26-30 at Pine Bluff, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Especially uplifting for the Cougars was the play of McCorkle, a 6-foot-5, 
210-pound senior forward headed for Syracuse next year. McCorkle did not play 
in Capistrano Valley's 82-59 loss to Edison Wednesday night. But against Corona 
del Mar, McCorkle was tough to stop, especially in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (4-5) struggled early, forcing shots and making mental mistakes 
as Capistrano Valley took a 10-3 lead. After a timeout, Corona del Mar upped 
its man-to-man defensive pressure, and slowly chipped away at Capistrano 
Valley's lead. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing 31-24 at halftime, Corona del Mar held Capistrano Valley 
scoreless for the first four minutes of the third quarter, as it went on an 8-0 
run to take a 32-31 advantage. The score was tied at the start of the fourth 
quarter, 39-39. 
</P>
<P>
That would be as close as Corona del Mar would get. As the Sea Kings' game fell 
apart -- thanks, in part, to a pressing Capistrano Valley defense -- Capistrano 
Valley went on an 11-2 run, thanks to a three-pointer and a layup off a steal 
by Chris Kostoff and six points, four on free throws, by McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff, who scored 40 points Wednesday night, was held to 11 points, nine in 
the fourth period. Warren Johnson had 24 points to lead the Sea Kings, and Doug 
Hesse added 16.

Ronnie Long had three touchdown runs and intercepted three passes as Temecula 
Valley High claimed its first CIF championship Saturday night with a 29-7 
victory over visiting Palos Verdes in the Southern Section Division VIII title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss marked the last football game for Palos Verdes, which is closing next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley (11-3) took the lead for good at 10-7 on Long's two-yard run 
with 4:25 left in the first half. Long led the Bears with 83 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Lassig's fumble recovery near midfield, Temecula Valley took a 16-7 
lead on David Gonzalez' 26-yard pass to Greg Campbell with 46 seconds remaining 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (8-6), which had a four-game winning streak snapped, took its only 
lead at 7-3 as running back George Felactu scored from a yard out, culminating 
the first drive of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sea King quarterback Tim King dropped back to pass only six times in the first 
half, but was guilty of three turnovers. King threw two first-half 
interceptions and was hit in the pocket before losing the ball to Lassig. 
</P>
<P>
On the game's opening series, the Bears drove to the Palos Verdes 29-yard line 
before missing a field goal. Then, on the first drive for Palos Verdes, the Sea 
Kings gained 41 yards in four carries before King was intercepted by Long. 
</P>
<P>
That turnover helped produce the game's first score on the ensuing drive, a 
36-yard field goal by Temecula Valley's James McKee. 
</P>
<P>
Long closed the scoring with two short touchdown runs in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Felactu paced Palos Verdes' attack with 65 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez picked apart the Palos Verdes defense with short passes in the first 
half, completing 11 of 14 attempts for 101 yards and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, Gonzalez completed 17 of 24 passes for 201 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez' favorite receiver was Campbell, who had 10 catches for 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings committed six turnovers; the Bears had only one. 
</P>
<P>
A 70-yard punt by John Miller was one of Palos Verdes' highlights.

<HEAD>Fragment of Gold Bracelet Linked to Ramses' Favorite Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of Ramses
II's beautiful Queen Nefertari found a fragment of beaten gold
jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for
3,250 years.
   Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been
attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and American
officials said Tuesday in announcing the find.
   If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it
would be rare indeed. The only other surviving legacy of Nefertari
is the lid of her sarcophagus, on exhibit at the Turin Egyptian
Museum in Italy.
   Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni called the jewelry, which
is 1{ inches long and an inch wide, ``a significant discovery _
only the second object ever found that probably belonged to
Nefertari.''
   The piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving
from Ramses' New Kingdom era, with golden pieces linked by chains
and beads and decorated with flowers.
   The fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queen's
burial chamber, found during a project to stop the decay of
Nefertari's tomb in southern Egypt's Valley of the Queens.
Sponsored by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., the project began
18 months ago and is expected to last another 3{ years.
   With its splendid vividly colored wall paintings, Nefertari's is
the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called ``the place
of beauty.'' Royal wives and children were buried there in rock-cut
tombs opposite the ancient capital Thebes, now called Luxor, 450
miles south of Cairo.
   Luis Monreal, the Getty Institute's director, said nobody
believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of
grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who
visited the tomb since its discovery in 1904.
   Workmen inching across the floor of the tomb's final chamber,
clearing away the centuries of dust by hand, found the fragment on
Feb. 8, Monreal said.
   It lay ``covered by dust, then by broken bits of wall paintings
which in themselves were covered by layers of dust,'' he said.
   ``Another real bonus that we hadn't expected is that we
recovered pieces of a complete segment (of wall painting), which
will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear
wall,'' he said.
   Although proof hasn't been found that the fragment was
Nefertari's, there are indications, including its hieroglyphic
inscriptions, Monreal said.
   Los Angeles-based British Egyptologist Helen Strudwick, who
studied the piece for Getty, found significance in the ritual
inscription ``true of voice,'' a phrase ancient Egyptians normally
used after the name of the person who died.
   She noted that the phrase had a feminine ending. That, plus the
fragment's discovery inside Nefertari's tomb, ``highly suggests''
that it was from the queen's burial paraphernalia, perhaps even
torn from her mummified body.
   ``The piece does not rank with the Tutankhamun treasure in
esthetic terms, but it still has historical and sentimental value
because the powerful Nefertari simply vanished,'' Monreal said.
   Nefertari, the beautiful and bold wife of warrior-hero Ramses
II, is thought to have died about age 45 about 3,250 years ago. Her
tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great
charm and exquisite taste, adorned with magnificent jewelry and
wearing fashionable gowns.
   Ramses' favorite of 13 wives, Nefertari accompanied her husband
in battle and helped negotiate the world's first peace treaty,
Ramses' agreement with the troublesome Hittites of Asia Minor. In
her famous temple at Abu Simbel, Nefertari is pictured begging
Ramses to be gentle with his captives.
   ``Nefertari was the world's first first lady,'' Monreal said.
``She was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two
temples at Abu Simbel in 1255 B.C. Then we know nothing of her.
Maybe this piece will tell us about her death.''

<HEAD>Tut's Real Curse: Bacteria Eating Wall Paintings In Famous Tomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rapidly multiplying bacteria
are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of King Tut's tomb,
one of Egypt's most-visited tourist sites.
   Specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest
the bacteria, but antiquities officials say the original color never
can be restored to the small, pox-like black specks and blotches
marring the walls.
   ``The situation inside the tomb is extremely serious,'' said
Mutaw'ie Balboush, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director
for upper Egypt. ``Damage is appearing almost everywhere you look
among the figures.''
   At the start of the winter tourist season in early November,
officials were so worried they considered closing the tomb to let
conservators work unhindered.
   After the antidote was developed last week, however, work to save
the paintings was scheduled before and after tourist hours.
   Tutankhamun, a young pharaoh who died in 1323 B.C., was buried in
a makeshift tomb stuffed with riches in the barren Valley of the
Kings _ the southern wasteland where royalty and nobility were
buried for 500 years.
   During tourist season, his single-chambered tomb draws more than
2,500 visitors a day.
   Its wall paintings, some with colors as bright as the day they
were painted, depict noblemen and officials transporting Tut's mummy
to the tomb. They include a unique scene of the ``Opening of the
Mouth'' rite in which the dead king is given eternal life.
   ``We can't simply remove the infection, because the bacteria have
become part of the paint itself,'' said restoration director Shawky
Nakhla. ``We have to put the bacteria in a situation that won't
endanger the tomb itself.
   ``In the past the bacteria were dormant, but something has
triggered them to life. When we looked at them in Cairo, they were
so active they were duplicating every day.''
   They found four kinds of bacteria and actinomycetes _ an
intermediate step between bacteria and fungi that in humans cause
abscesses under the skin.
   Omar Arini, science officer at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said
bacteria have been present in Egyptian tombs since they were sealed
thousands of years ago.
   ``If something changes the environment inside a tomb, such as a
rise in humidity, then bacteria can come to life,'' Arini said.
   ``When this happens, the situation is extremely dangerous not
only for the tomb but for others in the vicinity. The bacteria can
spread.''
   Nakhla said bacteria in Tut's tomb could have been activated by
high humidity, difficult to control with so many visitors. And the
number of tourists is expected to increase dramatically during peak
season over the next two months.
   Though smaller and with lesser-quality paintings than some of the
62 nearby tombs, Tut's burial place mesmerizes visitors.
   It owes part of its allure to the myth of a curse visited on
anybody who violates it. It gained prominence in the 1920s and
1930s, after a number of people from the expedition team that found
the tomb in 1922 died unusual deaths.
   Egyptologists scoff at the idea. Grave robbers violated the tomb
at least twice in antiquity and Egyptologist Howard Carter, the
expedition leader, died naturally in 1939 at age 66.

   Stonecutters squat in the field alongside the outer wall of the Jing Ling tomb, chipping away at large granite blocks. 
Watched over by a marble Chinese lion, they work with hammer and chisel, echoing the work of the 15th- and 16th-century stonecutters who worked on these magnificently crafted Ming Tombs. 
As the 30 or so men strike their blocks, the melody they make rings in harmony with the guide's rendition of his spiel: Chang Ling, Ming, Ding Ling, Ming, Jing Ling, Ming. 

   A cock crows in the distance, a workman with a shovel over his shoulder ambles by, and it is easy to believe that times have not changed much since the days of the Ming Dynasty. 

   The Ming emperors ruled a prosperous and fairly peaceful China from 1368 to 1644. 
When the third emperor moved the capital from Nanking to Beijing he set about finding a proper and peaceful royal burial place, near enough to the capital for fitting ceremonial respect to be paid, but remote enough to discourage curious visitors. 
Geomancers finally chose this forested, mountain-protected valley, about 30 miles northwest of Beijing. 

   Thirteen of the 16 Ming emperors lie here in elaborate tombs, each approached through a series of stylized, symbolic gates, screens and buildings. 
These structures are in various states of repair. 
It appears that the stonecutters are working to renovate Jing Ling, but that is not the case. 
The men are actually shaping stones to be used as the guardrails for a "flyover" (overpass) on the new superhighway being built nearby. 

   Ten thousand visitors a day come to look at the tombs. 
They drive through the Sacred Way, lined with mammoth stone animals and Chinese entrepreneurs hawking orange soda pop, T-shirts, cloisonne bracelets and fur hats. 
Past the Sacred Way, individual roads lead to the tombs. 

   Chang Ling, the oldest and largest of the tombs, has been meticulously renovated, but not excavated. 
All the tombs are easy to spot. 
The double-roofed stele pavilions immediately in front of each grave tumulus were built to command the valley, and their red roofs still dominate the scene. 
It is the names that confuse Westerners. 
The Ming emperors had a personal name and a reign name. 
Each tomb has a separate name, as does the temple within. 
Add to this the change in Chinese-to-English Romanization (Peking to Beijing, Ching-ling to Jing Ling) and it's easy to see why the tombs are referred to by number, chronologically. 
Tomb One (Chang Ling) holds the third Ming emperor, but the first to be buried in the valley. 

   The 10th tomb, Ding Ling, has been excavated and is open to the public. 
After climbing three flights of stairs, visitors can see the magnificent blue-and-white porcelain jars in which oil was set aflame as the tomb was closed (to create an oxygen-free vacuum) and the massive four-ton marble tomb doors that sealed from the inside. 

   Tomb Three, Jing Ling, where the stonecutters work, has not been excavated nor has its exterior been as meticulously restored as that of the first tomb. 
It was built by the fifth Ming emperor, who ruled 1425-35. 
Since most tourists go to the first or 10th tomb, a visit here can be a serene glimpse into Ming history and architecture. 
Once inside the outer walls it is easy to appreciate the peace that the emperors sought. 

   Inside the first courtyard, a triple set of steps leads up to what was once a sacrificial hall. 
The hall is gone, and the expanse of open ground where it was gives a feeling of spaciousness. 
A steep ramp leads up to the stele pavilion, forcing visitors to stoop as they approach the grave site. 

   The pavilion dominates Jing Ling and holds the grave stele, the emperor's flattering "tombstone." 
A hidden passageway connects this building with the actual grave site. 
The emperor does not lie alone in Jing Ling. 
His empress is buried with him, as are 10 concubines. 

   When the tomb is eventually opened it is apt to contain a trove of blue-and-white porcelain like the jars in Ding Ling that inspire feverish whispers among tourists. 
It was during the fifth emperor's reign that this famous porcelain was perfected. 

   Except for developments in porcelain and a penchant for amassing collections (including one of Korean virgins), the fifth emperor made few ripples in history. 
One incident, however, does stand out. 
When the guardian families of Jing Ling village, whose job it was to protect the tomb, cut some trees that the emperor thought important to the beauty and serenity of the site, he had the villagers executed. 

   He might not take kindly to the stonecutters, whose steady chipping helps to build a highway to bring the curious more easily to his tomb site. 
And he would certainly be appalled at the sight of the helicopter poised in a small clearing between the peach and apple orchards that ring Jing Ling. 
It waits to take customers on a noisy flying tour of the Ming Tombs.

Korean dancers, a choir of singers from seven churches and a student drill team 
will highlight Martin Luther King Day events in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers and choir will appear during services Monday night titled "His 
Dream Is Our Dream," sponsored by the Valley Interfaith Council, a coalition of 
about 200 churches. 
</P>
<P>
The service will start with a procession of about 40 elected officials and 
clergy from various religious faiths. Rabbi Aaron Weis, who walked with King in 
Alabama, will be among the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is get a Hispanic, Jewish, Korean, Protestant 
representation out here . . . to demonstrate that it's not just a holiday for 
blacks," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the interfaith council. The 
services will begin at 7:30 p.m. at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, 
18115 Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a drill team, choirs and dancers from at least 10 area schools 
will perform during a five-hour tribute beginning at 10 a.m. in the Pacoima 
Community Center at Glen Oaks and Van Nuys boulevards. Essays and art with the 
theme "His Dream Is Our Dream" will be shown at the Youth Culture Center, next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watch the young people perform, it's like a class," said Arthur 
Broadous, youth center director, who has seen the King tribute at least seven 
years. "A lot of kids never sat in the back of the bus, knew what it was like 
not to be able to eat in a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a student discussion of the "unfinished business" in King's legacy 
will end three hours of programming on the activist aired on KLCS-TV, Channel 
58, the educational station of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
programs begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In events today Harding Street School in Sylmar will hold its 21st annual 
commemoration of King, featuring a six-foot mural of the activist and 150 
students singing his favorite hymns. 
</P>
<P>
"The music is fantastic," said Susan Alves, a teacher and co-director of the 
program. "We had a dress rehearsal and two teachers were crying. . . ." 
Programs begin at 9 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. The school is at 13060 Harding St. 
</P>
<P>
Other events today include reenactments of Rosa Parks' bus trip in Alabama, 
where she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, triggering civil 
rights demonstrations. Re-enactments will be performed at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 
p.m. at Fenton Avenue School, 11828 Gain St. in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
All events are free and open to the public.

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the
funeral boat of one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs takes another
journey this week.
   The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off
the floor of the Field Museum of Natural History on Monday and
rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky
maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would
harm the ancient wood.
   Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in
about 1850 B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new
setting in the museum _ a $2.2 million permanent exhibit.
   When the exhibit opens in November, it will allow visitors to
walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat
goddesses and other treasures from ancient Egypt. The museum said
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside Egypt
to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex.
   King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like
craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures
from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes.
   Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh,
King Unis, dating to 2400 B.C. and excavated from Saqqara, Egypt,
in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into
the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When
it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers
or destroyed by time.
   Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a
variety of Egyptian burial rites.
   ``This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,''
said its developer, Janet Kamien. ``It gives them (visitors) a
chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after
death.''
   Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the
exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with
them to the afterworld.
   Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby.
   No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the
king's body across the Nile River to the burial site, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94
by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist. Two badly deteriorated
ones were left at the site.
   Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo and the other is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh.
   Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended
Egypt's boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan,
as well as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said.
   He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern
for several hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said
Yurco.

THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: CHRONICLES OF AN ABUNDANT LAND, BY WILLIAM F. KING. 
WINDSOR PUBLICATIONS INC.. $27.95, 152 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish government established La Mision 
del Santo Arcangel San Gabriel de Los Temblores in 1769, the surrounding land 
was marked chiefly by broad grass plains and clusters of oak and alder trees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the area known as the San Gabriel Valley is better identified as home to 
nine freeways, more than two dozen cities and communities and close to 2 
million residents. 
</P>
<P>
That transition from virgin land to major metropolis is the subject of 
historian William F. King's "The San Gabriel Valley: Chronicles of an Abundant 
Land." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Alhambra Chamber of Commerce, the book looks at the area's 
history and its impact on the rest of California. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as one of the state's most fertile regions, the valley was an 
original site of what was to become California's booming citrus industry, King 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the state's first freeway was built in the San Gabriel Valley. The 
opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, later called the Pasadena Freeway, ushered 
in an era of great highway construction for the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Today, King said, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and the region's 
aerospace industry continue to affect the rest of the state, country and world. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Glendora and history professor at Mt. San Antonio College, King 
said much of the material for the book came from the college courses he 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Chronicles of an Abundant Land" is one of a series of community and regional 
histories produced by Windsor Publications. Others in the series include the 
San Fernando Valley and St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
According to Windsor editor Jeffrey Reeves, the books chronicle histories of 
areas that might otherwise go unrecorded. "They tell a story that doesn't 
normally get told."

   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the
prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said Ahmed Osman.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt,'' was published in Britain
on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under negotiation.
   Osman's first book in 1987, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of Israel into Egypt.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the Bible in London for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the Egyptian
Embassy, held a reception Thursday night to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying Moses with Ikhnaton, Osman builds on Sigmund
Freud's last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at Jews' College,
University of London, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   Naim Dangoor, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' Dangoor said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,
daughter of Joseph the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when Moses was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that Moses was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, Ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, Tutankhamen.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in Sinai with
a few followers,'' Osman said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, Ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged Horemheb's general, Ramses, for
the throne but Ramses attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in 1333 B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by Ramses' successor, Seti I.
This fight is recorded in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
Moses and Egypt because of memories of the oppression, Osman
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
Moses became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   Eric Uphill, an Egyptologist at London's University College,
said he helped and supported Osman's research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, Uphill said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with Moses is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' Leperer said.
   Dangoor said Moses' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' Dangoor said.

CONEJO VALLEY MADE IT TOUGH BUT OFTEN FOUND A WAY TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conejo Valley established a reputation for playing exciting baseball this year, 
but it wasn't always in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Conejo Valley's young team had a tendency to be downright sporadic, as 
it was Saturday during a 10-9 win over District 16 rival Camarillo in the third 
round of the American Legion 6th Area playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A gallon of bleach could not have cleaned Conejo Valley's mess, but Coach Craig 
Sturges was still beaming over the opportunity to play at Jackie Robinson 
Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We do some strange things out there, but you gotta love it," Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
Sturges' heart has been in his mouth lately. His team avoided a disaster by 
inches when Jim Chergey's diving catch ended a nerve-wracking ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley took a 10-4 lead into the inning, but Camarillo (21-5), the 
District 16 champion, scored five runs -- four unearned -- courtesy of three 
Conejo Valley errors. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably saw more of that than I did, because I had my hands covering my 
eyes most of the time," Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time Conejo Valley fans had seen such unspectacular play. 
Last spring, all but one of Conejo Valley's players attended Thousand Oaks 
High. The Lancers led the Marmonte League in errors last season, still, the 
team developed a knack for come-from-behind wins. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Marcus, the Lancers' assistant coach, was at Saturday's game sporting a 
familiar grin. "TO baseball, baby," he said. Conejo Valley, a.k.a. Thousand 
Oaks, had lost three of four games to Camarillo during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley continued to employ its cardiac style in the playoffs. It came 
from behind to beat Santa Monica, 9-8, in 10 innings Thursday, and its shaky 
defense allowed Camarillo to crawl back into Saturday's contest. The magic 
ended a few hours later, however, when Woodland Hills West eliminated Conejo 
Valley, 13-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize a loose approach, but I think we played it a little too loose," 
Sturges said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Chris Borchard, who had led off the ninth inning Saturday with a 
walk and reached third on Jon McMullen's single, scored after an error on Mike 
Mitchell's grounder. Mike Muncy's bloop single drove in two more runs and cut 
the deficit to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley pitcher Bryan Corey, who had relieved Nick Brown, dropped a pop 
fly that would have ended the game. Then Kasha Clemons -- who had hit his 11th 
home run in the sixth -- stepped into the batter's box representing the tying 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Conejo Valley third baseman) Billy Hall that if Kasha hits a three-run 
dinger, we'll have to run over and revive Sturges," Camarillo Coach Gary Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemons didn't homer but still gave Sturges palpitations with a long fly ball 
to right field that Glenn Marshall dropped on the warning track. The error 
allowed two more runs to score and pulled Camarillo to within 10-9. And Clemons 
stood eagerly at second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a popup, and we drop it. Then I want a fly ball, and we drop 
that," Sturges said. "Then I just didn't want them to hit it to short, where my 
son (Brian) was." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch King lofted a fly ball into short center field and Chergey, who got a 
late jump, charged and made a diving catch. Chergey, who played on the junior 
varsity at Thousand Oaks last spring, started in place of Brent Christenson and 
was three for four. Christenson, who is batting .350, missed the game in order 
to practice with the U. S. Amateur team. 
</P>
<P>
"Chergey's only a sophomore, but he had a great game," Sturges said. "We put a 
load on his shoulders, and he carried the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, we play an exciting brand of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, the son of former major leaguer Ken McMullen, was three for five, and 
King, Garth Teron and Muncy each had two hits for Camarillo, which was coming 
off a last-inning, 5-2 loss to Claremont on Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some tough things happen to us," Wagner said. "But this group really 
developed, and we're happy with the way they played." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lee (6-2) allowed only one run in seven innings of relief for Conejo 
Valley. Hall, David Skeels and Corey each had two hits.

<P>
El Toro High School presented a different version of the two-minute offense 
Saturday at Tustin High, one that produced points in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger water polo team scored twice with less than two minutes remaining 
in first half, and J.P. Mathot scored the game-winning goal with 1:54 to play 
as El Toro (25-3) defeated Capistrano Valley, 3-2, in the Southern Section 4-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro will face Long Beach Wilson (22-6) in the final at 8:45 Wednesday night 
at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. Wilson beat Corona del Mar, 8-4, in the other 
semifinal. El Toro will be seeking its first 4-A championship after winning 
consecutive 3-A titles in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have an experience advantage over some teams," Mathot said, "because 
we aren't happy just to be in the finals, but we want to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (23-4) has dropped the past three meetings with El Toro, 
including last year's 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Mathot, who scored 31 goals in his previous five games, went scoreless for the 
first 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense for both teams today was unbelievable," El Toro Coach Ron Stoll 
said. "I thought J.P. was playing well, but he got frustrated because he tried 
to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played lousy today," Mathot said, "but I tried to focus myself to 
do at least one thing right on that last play." 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied, 2-2, and two minutes remaining, Mathot zeroed in when he 
received the ball in the hole. He turned Capistrano Valley defender Dan Hancock 
at the two-meter line, then fired his game-winner past goalie Nick Kittredge. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't crash down on Mathot on that play," Capistrano Valley Coach Don 
Cholodenko said, "but we lost the game because we didn't capitalize on our 
six-on-five advantages." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars went zero for three on the one-man advantages, but El Toro 
converted on two consecutive Capistrano Valley kick-outs, with Greg Craycraft 
and Jason Kneitel scoring, to erase a 2-0 deficit late in the first half.

<HEAD>Student Rediscovers Tutankhamun's Funeral Feast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the
ancient Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun for his journey to the
afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty
storeroom, a newspaper reported today.
   The Times of London said an archeological student discovered the
boxes of food remains at the Royal Botanical Gardens.
   The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since
they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by Howard Carter, who
discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor,
Egypt, in 1922.
   The remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist
Leonard Boodle, but were apparently forgotten after his death in
the 1930s.
   Arthur Bell, director of the gardens at Kew in south London, was
quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by Christian
Tutundjian de Vartavan, a 23-year-old French student working on a
master of science degree in ancient Egyptian plants at London's
University College.
   The Times said the college's Institute of Archaeology is trying
to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard,
which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five
pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's tomb
after his death more than 3,300 years ago.
   The Times said the species indentified so far include emmer
wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer and
a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on.
   Also found were coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries and grapes.
   The Times quoted University College botanist Gordon Hillman as
saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds.
   ``They will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated, how
they were harvested and how they were stored,'' Hillman was quoted
as saying.
   The newspaper said officials at Kew are willing to return the
specimens to the Egyptian government, but would like to put some on
display.
   The Independent newspaper said Tutundjian de Vartavan came
across the Tutankhamun remains while studying ancient Egyptian
plant remains.
   The Times and The Independent said the find represents only a
fraction of the food buried in the tomb. The rest is still in 116
original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo
Museum and the Dokki Agricultural Museum in Egypt.

   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the
prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said Ahmed Osman.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt,'' was published in Britain
on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under
negotiation.
   Osman's first book in 1987, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of Israel into Egypt.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the Bible in London for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the Egyptian
Embassy, held a reception Thursday night to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying Moses with Ikhnaton, Osman builds on Sigmund
Freud's last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at Jews' College,
University of London, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   Donald B. Redford, professor of Near Eastern studies at Toronto
University and an expert on Ikhnaton, scoffed at the theory.
   ``There is no evidence that Ikhnaton was a man called Moses and
the religious teachings of Ikhnaton have nothing to do with Moses,
who appears to have lived five centuries after him or longer,''
Redford said in a telephone interview.
   Naim Dangoor, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' Dangoor said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,
daughter of Joseph the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when Moses was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that Moses was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, Ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, Tutankhamen.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in Sinai with
a few followers,'' Osman said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, Ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged Horemheb's general, Ramses, for
the throne but Ramses attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in 1333 B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by Ramses' successor, Seti I.
This fight is recorded in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
Moses and Egypt because of memories of the oppression, Osman
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
Moses became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   Eric Uphill, an Egyptologist at London's University College,
said he helped and supported Osman's research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, Uphill said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with Moses is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' Leperer said.
   Dangoor said Moses' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' Dangoor said.

<HEAD>Pit In Luxor Temple Yields 15 More Ancient Statues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excavators have uncovered another 15 statues
of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside Luxor Temple that
yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year.
   The overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb
of Tutankhamun in 1922, which yielded enormous amounts of gold and
other precious objects, said Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization.
   ``The Tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about
the art of the day,'' Tawfik said Tuesday. ``This find will answer
many questions about many periods of history.''
   He said one of the new statues is unlike any ever found: a
42-inch-high white granite cobra, probably representing Mertsager,
the goddess of silence. Her job was to keep secret the location of
royal tombs in the bone-dry valleys of the kings and queens across
the Nile River opposite present-day Luxor 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Tawfik and other Egyptian officials said workers trying to take
the search deeper hit underground water at the 10-foot level that
makes digging more difficult.
   Water is more than 3 feet deep at the bottom of the pit,
endangering not only the excavation but a row of towering columns
nearby, Tawfik said.
   Many Egyptologists consider Luxor Temple, built more than 3,300
years ago, the most endangered monument in the antiquity-rich Luxor
area. It lies in a picturesque setting between the Nile and the
modern town of Luxor and suffers greatly from rising water and
other natural debilitations.
   The new statues, found in a sacred courtyard beneath the earlier
finds, cover a wide range of Egyptian history and include
depictions of some of Egypt's best-known rulers and a pantheon of
gods.
   Tawfik said the earliest appears to be an alabaster Sphinx
dating from the reign of Tutankhamun, the young pharaoh who died in
1323 B.C. after a 10-year reign. The latest is a whnite
cobra from the reign of Tao ruled for 26 years and died in
664 B.C. at a time when the pharaonic period was in its death
throes.
   He said some of theries are broken and lack the
artistic excellence of the original five.
   Most of the new stere found last month. Officials said
pieces of some statues were buried at diff
phenomenon they could not explain.
   On Jan.ound the first of the original five
beautifully preserved statues from the New Kingdom, a golden age of
wealth and power for Egyptian kings. The five dated from the reigns
of Amenhophis III, the builder of Luxor Temple who ruled from 1391
to 1353 B.C., to Haremhab, a powerful military commander who died
in 1307 B.C., 12 years after gaining the throne following
Tutankhamun's pnd the brief reign of the caretaker
Aya.
   Antiquities experts are debating why the statues ried,
when and by whom. The answers may never be found.
   ``We have to wait to find the answers, because evee
think we have the right information, we have to change our mim different
periods are found,'' Tawfik
said. ``Now we've even found Roman pottery'' in the exc  The Luxor Temple
cache doesn't appear to approach in number
those statues discovered early th
complex three miles away.
   At Karnak, the cache contained thousands of statues of gods and
individuals, ans cache contains only
royal and religious images and at least three unique statues,
Tawfik sai
   Statues in the latest find are of various materials and sizAn alabaster
statue of Ramses II, its head missing, stands on a is 30 inches high.
   Of the 15, the relic ins a 2-foot-tall
diorite head of the powerful god Amun wearing atwo feather crown.

HOWARD CARTER by T G H James Kegan Paul Pounds 24.95 443 pages
HOWARD CARTER BEFORE TUTANKHAMEN by Nicholas Reeves and John H Taylor
British Museum Pounds 12.95, 201 pages
AT LAST, 70 years after he found the tomb of Tutankhamen, Howard Carter is
receiving the acclaim he deserves - a major biography, a fascinating
exhibition at the British Museum and a lively book and television series to
accompany it. Why so long? Probably because he was difficult, litigious and
somewhat greedy - in short, 'a troublemaker'. Yet this archaeologist, who
never received an honour from British royalty and never went to university
but was an honorary doctor of Yale, resurrected the 14th century BC teenage
king of Egypt with a patience, determination and skill that still leave
professionals gasping.
How did Carter come to be the man who raised Tutankhamen from the dead? The
short answer is that he was well respected but out of work in 1909, when
Lord Carnarvon hired him to dig in the Valley of the Kings on the West Bank
of the Nile opposite Luxor. TGH James, retired Keeper of Egyptian
Antiquities at the BM, gives the long answer in his judicious, leisurely
biography, which fits many strange details in to their context (even if it
omits Almina Carnarvon's re-marriage within nine months of the Earl's
death.)
James's book will delight those eager to learn about archaeology abroad in
the days when Carnarvon ordered Jackson's of Piccadilly to send out curried
fowls and tabasco sauce to the Winter Palace in Luxor. And it will bring wry
smiles of recognition to any digger who has suffered prickly colleagues,
permit problems with host officials, and money disputes with committees in
London.
Carter came from a family of journeyman-artists. Aged only 17, his fine
watercolours of birds and wild animals gave him an extraordinary break when,
with a subvention from Lord Amherst, he went as a 'tracer' to record the
spirited paintings in the tombs at Beni Hasan in middle Egypt. The country
caught him. He lived in a tomb on a cliff overlooking the Nile and worked
from dawn to dusk.
His drawings and pictures, on view at the BM, show he was a prodigy with an
exceptional eye, a firm but lively line, and the humility and patience to
look at every little bit of what the ancient artist had created and
reproduce it. (He even includes the cracks and flaking.) As bland
photographs never can, his pictures take you straight back to how the world
saw itself 4000 years ago.
Two months later he had a dig of his own - for Amherst, but under the
direction of the great Flinders Petrie. Within three years (and still a
minor) he had changed for ever how draughtsmen drew Egyptian tombs. In the
meantime he started a lifelong career of part-time dealing in antiquities,
using his keen eye and knowledge of Arabic and the Egyptians which today
would be quite improper for a field archaeologist. It repaired his modest
circumstances, a constant nag to which patrons and grand friends did not
respond.
Later, he bought for Carnarvon and the American museums, and died in 1939,
comfortably off from commissions and lecture fees. He had come up in the
world, dressing with a touch of the rakish like Carnarvon, and had taken
elocution lessons.
At 25 he was chosen by the Director of Antiquities to be Inspector of Upper
Egypt at Luxor - an astonishing but perceptive testimonial to the excellence
of a self-taught man. Carter tackled the job practically, fitting gates and
installing electric light in the tombs in the Valley of the Kings so that
visitors at last could see them. He lived in 'Castle Carter' among the ruins
on the West Bank, where he kept a menagerie that included a pet gazelle.
Promotion to Lower Egypt was not so happy. In 1905 a fracas erupted with a
party of drunken French visitors at Saqqara. Carter's men used their sticks:
Carter he rushed off a telegram to Lord Cromer to explain. This revealing
incident strained the Entente Cordiale, a touchy thing in Egypt. The press
was fervid in both languages. Rights and wrongs are unclear. An apology from
Carter would have let it pass, everybody told him. He refused, and became
known as a difficult man. Soon after he resigned his job, thinking he would
make a living from his watercolours, dealing and high-class guiding.
A grim few years followed which Carnarvon, who had come to Egypt to recover
from a motor accident, broke by offering him a job to dig for him on the
West Bank (as well as buying antiquities). The two men became good friends.
In 1911 Carter built himself a second 'Castle Carter', with bricks from the
Earl's own brickworks stamped 'MADE AT BRETBY ENGLAND FOR HOWARD CARTER AD
THEBES 1910' - just as the Pharoahs used to do. In 1914 Carnarvon secured
the concession for the Valley of the Kings, where it seemed that only one
royal tomb had not been found. The First World war then interrupted the
proceedings, and Carter worked intermittently for Intelligence in Cairo.
In the Valley, Carter mapped everything that he - or anybody else - had
found. By autumn 1922 the only place left to look was under some huts. He
moved them and on November 4 found the entrance of the sealed royal tomb.
Carnarvon left Berkshire at once. On November 26 the two peered in through a
small hole. 'Can you see anything?' 'Yes, wonderful things.'
Troubles began forthwith - with the press, officials, visitors who thought
they deserved privileged access, and the scholars. 'Gold always maddens
people', Petrie wrote later. Nerves were at breaking point: was the tomb
really intact? Yes] and although there had been a break-in a very long time
ago, the tomb had been resealed. Carter faced the most difficult and most
spectacular task that archaeology has ever seen. The pressure was colossal.
Thank goodness for his cool determination. He assembled a first-rate team
and took ten years to clear the tomb. It was all worth the effort, the rows,
and suffering from ill health. If in doubt, go to the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo, and in the BM exhibition look at Carter's catalogue cards and records
to see with what superb professionalism this awkward and, I assume,
resentful man did the job.
From Earl's Court in London and Swaffham in Norfolk it is a long way to the
Valley of the Kings. It was his eye that carried him forward, both by what
he drew or bought and, figuratively, because he recognised what was really
important. To grasp fully his achievement, visit Howard Carter Before
Tutankhamen at the BM (till May 31), and look at his watercolours, his
plans, and the wonderful pieces he bought for his collectors. An entrancing
video, slowed down to cut out the jerky movements of 1920s film, shows him
at work. Tut brought blessings, not curses.

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inch by inch, with the help of expert riggers,
the funeral boat of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharoahs
took another journey Tuesday, to a new $2.2 million museum exhibit.
   Hydraulic jacks, dollies and a forklift were used to move the
fragile, 3,847-year-old wooden boat about 50 yards from a display
section of the Field Museum of Natural History to an exhibit
designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb.
   ``It went very well,'' said Suzanne Santos, a museum spokeswoman.
   Before the move, the 32-foot boat _ a graceful craft resembling
a canoe _ was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was
pointing south to its new destination, Mrs. Santos said.
   Riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their
hands off, so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood.
   The boat, used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about
1850 B.C., now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called
``Inside Ancient Egypt,'' which opens in November.
   The actual moving of the boat took about an hour, Mrs. Santos
said.
   The ancient craft has been at the museum since 1900, and for at
least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other
Egyptian artifacts.
   ``It was your typical museum collection,'' Mrs. Santos said.
   The new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient Egypt,
though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat,
she said.
   The exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside
Egypt to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex, with two
burial chambers, mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess Bastet,
the museum said.
   King Sen-wosret's boat is among more than 1,000 artifacts to be
displayed.
   Visitors will enter the tomb chambers of Unis-ankh, son of the
5th Dynasty pharaoh Unis. The chambers date to 2400 B.C. and were
excavated at Saqqara, Egypt, in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft will take visitors
into the dark burial chamber itself. The sarcophagus is empty. When
the tomb was excavated, the mummy was gone, probably stolen by tomb
robbers.
   Leaving the burial chamber, visitors will pass through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into a series of Egyptian burial
scenes featuring dioramas, 23 mummies and other artifacts.
   ``It gives (visitors) a chance to explore the age-old mysteries
of mummies and life after death,'' said the exhibit's developer,
Janet Kamien.
   Sen-wosret's boat was one of four excavated in 1894 from his
tomb at Dashur by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist, the
museum said. Two are at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the other
is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   No one knows if Sen-wosret's boats were used to transport his
body across the Nile to the burial site, or if they was buried near
the tomb for use in the afterlife by the king's soul, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   Sen-wosret conducted military campaigns that extended Egypt's
boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan, as well
as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said. He
also centralized the government, setting the pattern for several
hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, Yurco
said.

CHURCH GROUP TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of more than 40 churches in the northeast San Fernando Valley 
announced plans Sunday to form a community-based volunteer group to combat 
social problems such as drugs and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a meeting of the Ministers' Fellowship of the 
Greater San Fernando Valley attended by more than 200 people, including 
representatives from several homeowner groups, at First United Methodist Church 
of Pacoima. Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden delivered a brief speech 
supporting the group's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, assistant to the president of the group, said the organization 
wants to reassert the black church's historical importance and effectiveness in 
dealing with a number of social ills, including the proliferation of drugs, 
gang activity and other crime in northeast Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the organization, known as the Ministers' Fellowship of the Greater 
San Fernando Valley, will establish a non-religious group, to be named Focus 
90, to address these issues. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group will provide counseling, drug- and alcohol-treatment programs 
and financial support to homeless youngsters or those who might be without 
proper family support. The group also will be involved in neighborhood cleanup 
programs in an effort to restore community pride, and will work closely with 
the Los Angeles Police Deparment to provide safer neighborhoods, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group's main goal will be to re-establish the church's leadership 
role in the community, something he said was lost with the assassination of 
Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. King's birthday is being celebrated today as a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try and create that type of leadership again, in a small way, in 
the northeast Valley," Taylor said, adding that he hoped that social programs 
established by the fellowship would spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony Sunday, the Rev. James V. Lyles, pastor of the First United 
Methodist Church of Pacoima, was installed as president of the fellowship. 
Lyles was elected to the post two months ago.

DIGEST: FORMER SIMI VALLEY COACH JOINS CLU FOOTBALL STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Murphy, a former Simi Valley High football coach, will join Joe Harper's 
Cal Lutheran staff as a part-time assistant and will coach the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is one of several coaches Harper has hired to fill out his eight-man 
staff. Wayne Quigley, an assistant at Calabasas High; Bob Misko, an assistant 
at Royal High; and Broderick Jackson, an assistant at West Los Angeles College 
also will be part-time assistants, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
In six years as Simi Valley coach, Murphy led the school to its only Marmonte 
League football championship. He had a 21-40-1 record and resigned after the 
1989 season. Murphy will share offensive-line responsibilities with Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy will continue to coach the Simi Valley girls' basketball team and teach 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has received an official letter of confirmation from the 
NCAA approving the school's reclassification from Division II to Division I in 
all sports except football. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from NCAA membership coordinator Shirley Whitacre to Northridge 
President James W. Cleary states that the school's request for reclassification 
has been approved, effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The university also announced that Paul A. Bubb has been hired as director of 
athletic development, effective Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bubb, 33, comes to Northridge from Drake University, where he was director of 
athletic development and alumni relations in 1988-89. Before that, he was 
director of development at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, from 
1985-88.

<HEAD>Archaeology Student Finds King Tut Hoard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain,
dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300-year-old tomb of the
Egyptian King Tutankhamun, archaeologists said Thursday.
   ``It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because
it's a very large amount of material,'' said John Evans, director
of the University of London's Institute of Archaeology.
   ``Very little work has been done on material of this period in
Egypt, and I understand that some of the species which have been
identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences,'' Evans said at
a news conference.
   Most of the discovery consists of the food placed in
Tutankhamun's tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife.
Scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide
best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the Egyptians at
the time of Tutankhamun's death in 1323 B.C.
   For more than 50 years, the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30
cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the Royal Botanical
Gardens. The specimens were sent in 1932 by Howard Carter, the
British archaeologist who discovered Tutankhamun's treasure-laden
tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor, Egypt, in 1922.
   They were to have been cataloged by the botanist Leonard Boodle.
But Boodle and Carter both died in the 1930s before the work could
be completed, and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled ``From
Ancient Egypt.''
   In February of this year, the material was turned over to a
French graduate student at the archaelogical institute, 23-year-old
Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan, for research leading to a
master's degree in archaeobotany, the institute's speciality.
   He recognized notations on the boxes as those of Carter,
providing the first clue that they might be from Tutankhamun's
tomb. Scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually
fragments were matched with photographs taken by Carter.
   ``It all fit in. It was beyond coincidence,'' said
archaeobotanist Gordon Hillmann, who supervised the student's work.
Tutundjian de Vartavan did not attend the news conference.
   Professor David Harris, director of the archaeology institute's
Department of Human Environment, said the announcement was delayed
until it had completed scientific analysis.
   ``We were anxious to announce it as soon as possible, lest it
should leak out, but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long
as possible, so that we could get as much work accomplished as we
could,'' Harris said.
   He acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that
the Egyptian government might demand possession before the
institute had completed its analysis.
   Last week, the institute informed the Egyptian Embassy in London
about the discovery and offered to return the material. As of
Thursday, the institute had received no reply, Harris said.
   The hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than
five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's
tomb, Harris said.
   Among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the
journey, barley for brewing beer, a large quantity of watermelon
seeds to chew on, coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries, grapes and a datelike fruit known as
a jujube.
   The grains, fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that
figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into
food needed by the ``ka'' _ one of the king's souls _ in the
afterlife, Harris said.
   Dr. Ken Thomas, a specialist in insects, said the remains of
thousands of beetles also had been identified. The foods were to
sustain the boy king through eternity, Thomas said, ``but the
insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them.''
   The find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the
tomb. Harris said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker
baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo Museum and the Dokki
Agricultural Museum in Egypt.

3-A NEWCOMERS REACH SEMIFINALS;

<P>
EL CAMINO REAL, FREMONT TO MEET IN DECLASSIFIED CITY SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two teams that have benefited from a drop in class will meet tonight in the 
semifinals of the City Section 3-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the key in that pronouncement is 3-A. El Camino Real and Fremont, which 
play at 7:30 tonight at Fremont, have flourished under the City's releaguing 
plan that bumped each school to the 3-A level in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont advanced to the 4-A playoffs last season and even knocked off Cleveland 
and Taft in the first two rounds, but the Pathfinders were overmatched against 
Crenshaw in the 4-A semifinal, losing, 93-72. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, Fremont is king of the hill in the 3-A. The top-seeded 
Pathfinders breezed to the Central League title with a 12-0 record and will 
take a 24-3 mark into tonight's game. Behind the play of 6-5 senior Tyrone 
Phillips, who has scored 50 points in postseason play, they squashed Eagle Rock 
in the first round, 96-57, and dispatched University, 58-51, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four Fremont players score in double figures, led by Phillips at 18.8. He is 
followed by Chris Ford (16.5), Lionel Pandy (14.4) and Maurice McKenzy (10.5., 
8 assists, 5 steals), all of whom play guard in Fremont's three-guard offense. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real also has found life in the 3-A less hazardous to its health. The 
Conquistadores opened Northwest Valley Conference play with four games against 
North Valley League opponents, who compete at the 4-A level. El Camino Real 
lost three of the four but then won five of six West Valley League games to 
enter the playoffs as the league's first-place representative. Two rounds 
later, they are the only Valley-area boys' team still playing. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the drop in class, the Conquistadores (11-8) have benefited from the 
play of Brent Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-6 senior forward is averaging 23.1 points a game and 8.3 rebounds. He 
scored 33 in a 72-57 win over Lincoln and 19 in Wednesday's 67-63 victory over 
Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as critical to El Camino Real's success is senior Jason Steele, who 
averaged fewer than 10 points during the regular season but has blossomed in 
the playoffs. After an 11-point, 10-rebound effort against Lincoln, he scored a 
team-high 23 points and also blocked eight shots against Jefferson. Controlling 
his emotions has given him as much difficulty as opponents this season. He was 
suspended for a game this season for his role in an on-campus fight, and Coach 
Mike McNulty benched him for two minutes after receiving a technical foul 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those teams talk a lot and he has to tune it out," McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
"But even though he lost his temper, that was the best game he's played. He was 
probably worth 15 or 20 points on defense. If he gets in foul trouble we're not 
the same team." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after recording one of the biggest wins in its history, the Reseda 
girls' team will make its third Sports Arena appearance in three years in 
today's 4 p.m. City 4-A semifinal against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Regents boosted their record to 16-4 with a 79-72 victory over Kennedy on 
Wednesday, the Golden Cougars' first playoff loss to a Valley team this decade. 
Apparently, the releaguing plan that promoted Reseda to the 4-A level has not 
hurt the Regents, City 3-A champions the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Regent Coach Andrea Francola is not thrilled about returning to action 
so soon after the Kennedy game, nothing can diminish the importance of that 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed we have only one day between games, but we're never going 
to forget that game," she said. "It will always be a good memory." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is no stranger to the Sports Arena, either. The Generals, 
co-champions of the Southern League, own a six-game win streak. Washington has 
reached the semifinals four of the past five years and twice has been 4-A 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is led by a pair of 5-6 junior guards. Detra Lockhart (17.6 ppg) and 
Remitha Houston (20.7) are cousins who run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda will counter with a diversified attack featuring Jennifer Marzahl, 
Cheryl Hightower and Aggie Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-A semifinal, Canoga Park will travel to Roosevelt for a 7:30 p.m. game. 
The Hunters (9-7) won the West Valley League championship behind the play of 
Soo Yoon and her twin Joo, who emigrated from South Korea last year. Soo is a 
5-10 forward who averages 19 points and Joo is a 5-7 point guard averaging 7 
assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt (11-3), the Eastern League champion, is led by Luscinda Silva, the 
league MVP who averages 29.2 points.

<P>
After guiding Poly High to seven East Valley League track titles in the past 
eight years, Coach Scott King came to Birmingham in September with a reputation 
as a winner. 
</P>
<P>
If Birmingham's 110-16 romp over Grant in a Valley Pac-8 Conference opener 
Friday is an indication, King could be headed for another championship season. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Rodney Burt and Brian Gastelum, the Braves won 14 of 15 events, 
including every running event. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships, won the 100 
in 11.1 seconds and the 200 in 22.8. He also anchored the Braves' 400-meter 
relay team to victory in 45.5. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, a junior, won the 1,600 meters in 4 minutes, 36.5 seconds and the 
3,200 in 10:35.0. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Steve Weinberger added victories in the long jump (20-2) and the 
triple jump (37-3). 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
Taft 67, San Fernando 63 -- The Tigers won seven of 13 individual events, but 
Taft's superior depth prevailed in the Northwest Valley Conference opener at 
Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Howard McCrary and Ibed Aguirre were double winners for San Fernando. McCrary 
won the 110-meter high hurdles in 15.5 and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles in 
47.5. Aguirre, fourth in last year's City cross-country championships, ran 
4:51.3 in the mile and 10:00.0 in the two-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Hart led Taft with win in 100 meters (11.2) and 220 yards (23.7). Hart 
also ran on Hart's victorious 440 relay (46.0). 
</P>
<P>
Other top performances were turned in by Taft's Cornell Hill in the high jump 
(6-2) and San Fernando's Sean Williams in the long jump (20-3). 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 71, North Hollywood 51 -- Chris Harvey and Mario Armijo each won two 
events for Monroe in the Valley Pac-8 Conference opener at home. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey won the 100 meters in 11.4 seconds and the 220 yards in 23.4 and 
anchored the 440 relay in 45.4. Armijo won the 110-meter high hurdles in 16.6 
and the 330-yard intermediates in 42.7. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Derril White-Fleming won the long jump at 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Taft 64, San Fernando 43 -- Sophomore Jane Kim won three events for Taft in the 
Northwest Valley Conference opener at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Kim won the 220-yard dash in 28.7, the 100-meter low hurdles in 17.3 and the 
long jump at 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore teammate Sarah White won the high jump at 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 63, Grant 46 -- The Braves' dominance of the distance events powered 
them to victory in the Valley Pac-8 Conference opener at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Heather Ballard won the 800 in 2:31.0 and senior Cheri-Lee Segal was 
victorious in the 1,600 (5:43.1) and 3,200 (12:36.0). 
</P>
<P>
Another Birmingham freshman, Montoya Johnson, won the 400 in 65.1. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 61, Monroe 41 -- The Vikings dominated the sprints, but North 
Hollywood won both relays and swept the distance events in the Valley Pac-8 
Conference opener at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Kynna Wright won the 100 meters (13.1) and 440 yards (1:10.3) for Monroe, and 
teammate Tamika Stewart won the 220 yards in 27.8. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joy Preston (880) and Shelby Serpa (mile and two-mile) won events for 
North Hollywood.

Laguna Beach High School swept to a surprisingly easy 15-4, 15-7, 15-9 victory 
over Capistrano Valley Tuesday night to advance to the semifinals of the 
Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists' (19-1) superior serving game and balanced attack was more than a 
match for the Cougars (17-4), who were coming off their first South Coast 
League championship. The victory sets up Thursday's semifinal match with Mira 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is the tournament's No. 1 seed and is rated the top high school 
girls' volleyball team in the nation by USA Today. The Artists are the 
tournament's No. 4 seed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the capability to win three straight," Artists Coach Lance 
Stewart said. "When we're on top of our game, we can do it, and this was our 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Kit Spath's ace serve gave the Artists a 10-3 advantage 
en route to their 15-4 first-set victory, and the Cougars could never recover 
after that. "The girls seemed to get frustrated," Cougar Coach John Gipe said. 
"We were our own worst enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitters Sara Nelson and Spath led the balanced Laguna scoring with nine 
kills apiece. Kealy Clark had eight. Setter Angie Rush contributed 12 assists. 
Becky Linhart (12 kills, five blocks, six assists) and Christina Grady (10 
kills) led Capistrano Valley's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 3, St. Joseph 0 -- Krista Hartling had 10 kills and seven digs 
and Lara Carlsen had 11 kills and eight blocks as the Sea Kings (23-1) advanced 
to the semifinals with a 15-10, 15-8, 15-13 victory at home. Setter Prentice 
Perkins had 27 assists for the Sea Kings, who will play Santa Barbara Thursday 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In 4-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 3, Edison 1 -- Sharman Grant had 18 kills and Jonnie Jung had 10 to 
lead the Aztecs (16-1), 15-12, 15-9, 12-15, 15-10, at Esperanza. Esperanza will 
play Arcadia in the semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 3, LA Baptist 2 -- Adine Powloski had 17 kills and Megan Morse 
had 12 kills and four blocks as Santa Margarita (19-2) won, 15-12, 13-15, 
15-12, 9-15, 15-9, at home. Santa Margarita will play St. Anthony in the 
semifinals Thursday. TOM BIRSCHBACH

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Greene King sells Morland stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, has sold for Pounds 28.7m its 28.8 per
cent stake in Morland, the Thames Valley brewer it failed to acquire in
1992.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, bought the 6.23m shares for 460p a share and
placed them with institutions. Greene King had paid an average of 450p a
share for them during the abortive bid, with the bulk coming from the
Whitbread Investment Company.
Greene King will book an exceptional profit of Pounds 600,000 before
expenses but it had already taken a Pounds 2.7m charge for the bid costs in
its 1992 results. It will use the proceeds to cut its debt to Pounds 66m
from Pounds 95m. Gearing will fall by 10 percentage points to 30 per cent.
Greene King was attracted by Morland's pub estate in the Thames Valley. It
also hoped to close Morland's Abingdon brewery and use the site as a
distribution centre for its own beers such as Abbott and IPA.

<TEXT>
<P>
Top teams: (Listed alphabetically) Capistrano Valley, Corona del Mar, Dana 
Hills, El Dorado, Estancia, Fountain Valley, Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Top individuals: Page Bartelt (junior, Capistrano Valley), Jamie Fouret 
(senior, Dana Hills), Jeannette Fylpaa (junior, University), Anne Mall (junior, 
Dana Hills), Jackie O'Leary (senior, Corona del Mar), Keri Phebus (junior, 
Corona del Mar), Kristen Pollock (senior, Corona del Mar), Renee Urricariet 
(senior, Fountain Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Important dates: Nov. 17, individual sectionals; Nov. 20, 29, 30, Southern 
Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Corona del Mar Coach Gary Salazar rates his Sea Kings as the team to 
beat in the Sea View League, and the returning talent he has supports his case. 
A third consecutive Southern Section 4-A team title seems an attainable goal. 
Phebus, O'Leary, Pollock and senior Courtney Strauss lead the team. Last 
season's Southern Section 3-A champion, Dana Hills, has moved up to the 4-A 
division and should be a good test for Corona del Mar during the playoffs, 
especially if Mall is healthy. Mall, arguably one of the top three singles 
players in the county, has been bothered by a rotator cuff strain in her right 
shoulder. Also contending in the 4-A class will be Capistrano Valley and its 
ace, Bartelt.

The Ocean View, La Quinta and Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball teams will find 
themselves in unfamiliar positions when the Southern Section playoffs continue 
Saturday night: Each will be making the school's first appearance in the girls' 
playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (26-2) will play Buena (25-0) in a 5-A game at Ventura High School; 
La Quinta (25-3) will meet Palm Desert (25-2) in a 4-A game at College of the 
Desert, and Rancho Alamitos (20-3) will play San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, the fourth-seeded team in the 5-A division, faces a difficult task 
for several reasons. Buena, the top-seeded team in 5-A, has plenty of playoff 
experience. Last year, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals. They have been 
semifinalists four times before in the 4-A division, finalists five times, 
champions in 1979 and '84 and state champions in Division I in '83 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have advanced to the playoffs in each of Coach Joe Vaughan's 16 
years. Vaughan has the best record (351-29) in the state among girls' coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Buena has lost only twice at home in the past 10 years, to Santa Barbara two 
seasons ago and to state champion Brea-Olinda last season. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Ocean View is that although the game is a home game for 
Buena, at least it won't be played in Buena's gym. All semifinal games are at 
alternate sites. The game will be played at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has a definite height advantage with 6-2, 185-pound Jennifer 
Sullivan (17.4 ppg, 14.6 rebounds) and 5-11 Tracy Wolfe (13.3 ppg, 9.5 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (18-9) vs Loara (16-10) at Savanna High School -- Loara has come on 
strong in the playoffs, upsetting Mission Viejo in the quarterfinals and 
second-seeded Woodbridge in the second round. Loara is led by 6-1 junior center 
Tracy Titus (16.6 ppg, 10.9 rebounds). Jennifer Leonard, Liz Redman and Kristin 
Thibodeau provided strong support, and senior guard Lisa Nakazono runs the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, like Loara, is unseeded. The Cougars upset third-seeded Westlake in 
the second round before eliminating Edison. They are led by 5-7 junior guard 
Cori Herman (16.45 ppg), an adept three-point shooter, and 5-9 sophomore 
forward Denise Rea (9.5 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (25-3) vs Palm Desert (25-2) at College of the Desert -- La Quinta 
has dominated the not-so-tough Garden Grove League, winning nine straight 
titles. But in the past, the Aztecs have faltered when they met tougher 
competition in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia (33.4 ppg, 11.8 rebounds), a 6-1 
guard-forward-center who last year led the state in scoring. Heather Brannan, a 
5-11 senior forward, averages 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Palm Desert starts a good-sized lineup including leading scorers 
Tisa Read (5-10) and Brenda Joyce (5-10) each of whom average about 12 points. 
Senior guard Christie Dammer, whom coach Randy Housken calls the best defensive 
guard in Southern California, will attempt to stop Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (28-0) vs Alemany (20-6) at Esperanza High School -- Top-seeded 
Brea-Olinda has trounced two playoff opponents. The Lady Cats, the defending 
division champions, are led by state player of the year Aimee McDaniel and 
all-state guard Tammy Blackburn. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, the fourth-seeded team in the division, is led in scoring by 5-2 
sophomore Rachel Corelli (10 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (26-4) vs. Estancia (14-12) at University High School -- Unseeded 
Estancia has come on strong in the playoffs, upsetting third-seeded Lompoc in 
the quarterfinals, thanks to a school-record 42-point performance by junior 
guard Melody Earle. 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Lumpkin, a 5-10 forward, averages 12.6 points a game. Forward Monique 
Sweet also provides some solid play. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes has won the Bay League title and reached the playoffs the past 
three seasons, advancing to the 4-A semifinals last year. The Sea Kings have a 
definite height advantage with three starters at least 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Humphreys, a 5-10 senior forward leads the Sea Kings in scoring with 15.2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas (16-6) vs Rancho Alamitos (20-3) at Bolsa Grande High School -- 
Rancho Alamitos, the top-seeded team in the division, is led by Jenny Newsome, 
a 5-9 senior who averages 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. San Dimas relies 
heavily on inside scoring, which should contrast strongly with the Vaqueros 
up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Kramer, a 5-11 senior center, and Shelly Baughn a 5-11 junior post 
player each average 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
South Hills (19-5) vs. Costa Mesa (15-11) at Estancia High School -- Costa Mesa 
is undoubtedly the Cinderella team of the division. The unseeded Mustangs were 
third in the Pacific Coast League, but they are in the semifinals after 
upsetting third-seeded Bellflower convincingly and defeating Notre Dame of 
Sherman Oaks in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are led by Orange County's best freshman -- Olivia DiCamilli. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds but she's scoring more 
points in the playoffs. Junior forward Rachel Ward averages 10.8 points and 
senior guard Thuy Nguyen, a three-point threat, averages 11.1 points. Senior 
Michele Bryant runs the point and junior Robin Nichols is the fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded South Hills defeated at-large Yucca Valley by 14 points in the 
second round, then edged Cabrillo, another at-large team, by six points in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley (20-3) vs Santa Margarita (20-6) at Saddleback College at 7 
p.m. -- Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team in the division, meets its 
stiffest competition in top-seeded Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are led by sophomore Kristen Mulligan, the only Santa Margarita 
player who averages in double figures (22.1 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley has plenty of height. Amy Kisling (5-11) leads Santa Ynez 
Valley with 14.2 points a game, followed by 5-11 Amy Gillingham (11.2 ppg) and 
5-2 Jenifer DeMatteo (11 ppg).

<LEADPARA>  Wilma Dyche, a longtime resident of both the Pajaro and Santa Clara valleys
who had been in failing health for several years, died Monday in Watsonville
at the age of 93. She was a musician and a church organist, but she played no
religious favorites.;    Mrs. Dyche was born a Methodist, so it was natural
that she started playing the organ at the First United Methodist Church of
Watsonville. It was a reed instrument; pumping its pedals fills the bellows
and makes the sound.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WILMA DYCHE, ORGANIST AT WATSONVILLE CHURCHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     When the First Christian Church of Watsonville was rebuilt after several
fires, it had a new organ -- a pipe organ -- no pedals, no pumping, and those
pipes filled the sanctuary with chords.;    "It was like dangling a carrot,"
said Mrs. Dyche's daughter, Ayleen Martin of Watsonville. First Christian
wanted Mrs. Dyche, and she wanted that pipe organ, Martin said. She played it
virtually every Sunday for more than 30 years.;    "The pipe organ is the king
of instruments," said Inez Jefferson, a friend of Mrs. Dyche's. She knows that
because she also played church organs in San Jose and also taught piano.;   
Mrs. Dyche closed out her career as a Watsonville church organist with a
several-year stint at All Saints' Episcopal Church, where Martin was a
member.;    Mrs. Dyche had graduated with a degree in music from College of
the Pacific when it was still in San Jose, then married Justin K. Dyche, a
Watsonville High School teacher who died in 1953.;    Mrs. Dyche was a
teacher, too. She taught scores of Pajaro Valley youngsters how to play the
piano, then continued doing the same for many years after moving to the Santa
Clara Valley in the late 1960s.;    Mrs. Dyche belonged to the Music Teachers
Association of Santa Clara County and the American Guild of Organists. For
more than 50 years she was a member of the PEO Sisterhood, a philanthropic and
educational organization seeking opportunities in higher education for women.;

<TEXT>
   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient Egypt made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious Egypt Exploration Society,
drew headlines in London newspapers on Friday.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for Tutankhamen's beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient Egypt, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.
   But Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries PLC, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
Thursday in Edinburgh.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el Amarna, one of Egypt's ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of Cairo.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director Barry
Kemp of Cambridge University, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by Queen Nefertiti.
   She was the leading wife of King Tutankhamen's father, the
Pharaoh Akhnaton, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from 1333 to 1323 B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in 1922. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   Merrington said Nefertiti's temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from Tutankhamen's day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows Nefertiti
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   Merrington said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and Newcastle would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in Europe,
America and Egypt,'' Merrington said. ``We will use 20th century
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' Kemp said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''

Section 4-A water polo playoffs. Corona del Mar High School stood alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings were undefeated and the odds-on favorite to win their third 
consecutive 4-A title. The came the fall, three losses which cost Corona del 
Mar the Sea View League title and the No. 1 ranking in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Filling the void is El Dorado, champions of the Empire League. The Golden Hawks 
defeated Corona del Mar twice in the last three weeks, including the 
championship game of the California State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, El Dorado (22-3) is the No. 1 seeded team going into the playoffs, 
which begin Friday. Villa Park (22-4) is the second-seeded team, Sea View 
League champion Newport Harbor (17-9) third and Long Beach Wilson (17-8) 
fourth-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
And Corona del Mar? For the first time this decade, the Sea Kings are not one 
of the top four seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
Success is nothing new to the Golden Hawks, who won three consecutive 3-A 
titles from 1985-87. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks, who are led by Matt Maclear and Kyle Utsumi, will play Long 
Beach Poly (10-10) at El Dorado in the first round on Friday.
