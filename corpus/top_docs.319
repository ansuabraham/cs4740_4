<HEAD>Scandinavian Airlines Closes Continental Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airlines System completed a $50
million deal Thursday that makes it the largest shareholder of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and puts Frank Lorenzo out as
Continental chairman.
   Lorenzo will get $30 million through the arrangement, approved a
day earlier by the Transportation Department, but a Continental
spokesman said the money is not all coming from the SAS purchase.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo's $30 million is paid out over a period of time
through the company,'' spokesman Art Kent said. ``It's not like
he's getting a lump sum.''
   SAS said it paid Lorenzo $17 million to buy out his employment
contract and to obtain vested options he had in Continental stock,
although Lorenzo retains options on 783,333 shares. Lorenzo remains
as a Continental director.
   As part of the deal, SAS purchased Jet Capital Corp., which
Lorenzo and partners used as a holding company for their shares of
Continental. SAS also bought 2.25 million newly issued shares of
Continental for $14 per share.
   Continental, based in Houston, Texas, and SAS, based in
Stockholm, Sweden, issued a joint statement Thursday evening that
also announced several appointments to the 15-member Continental
board.
   As previously announced, the former president of Delta Airlines,
Hollis L. Harris, of Atlanta, becomes president and chief executive
of Continental. Harris also joins the board.
   Long-time Continental director Carl Pohlad, of Minneapolis, was
elected chairman. Robert Garrett, of New York, was elected chairman
of the executive committee.
   SAS said it would appoint three members to the Continental
board, including Jan Carlzon, of Stockholm, president and chief
executive of SAS Group. The other SAS appointees are Lars Bergvall,
of Stockholm, chief operating officer of SAS; and Roberto Mendoza,
of New York, vice chairman of J.P. Morgan.

stock Aug. 9. That increased the Scandinavian line's share of
Continental to 16.8 percent. SAS also paid $21 million for Jet
Capital, which owns a large share of Continental and had been 80
percent owned by Lorenzo and its other directors.
   Continental Holdings spokesman Art Kent said the company has

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department will allow
Scandinavian Airlines System to buy out most of Frank Lorenzo's
interest in Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the department said
Wednesday.
   The move will nearly double SAS's stake in the parent company of
Continental Airlines through a $52.5 million stock purchase.
   Under the deal approved by the department, Scandanavian Airlines
will own 16.8 percent of Continental and 18.4 percent of its voting
stock, and will be given three seats on the holding company's
15-member board.
   However, SAS agreed to not buy more than 22 percent of
Continental's voting stock for three years. It cannot own more than
25 percent because of U.S. laws requiring that domestic airlines be
controlled by Americans. SAS already owned 9.9 percent of
Continental's voting stock.
   SAS agreed to buy 2.25 million shares of newly issued
Continental stock for $31.5 million and will pay another $21
million to buy Jet Capital Corp., which owns another 2.1 million
shares of Continental stock. The Jet Capital stock was owned by
Lorenzo.
   Lorenzo, who continues to own some 800,000 shares of the
company, resigned last month as chief executive officer of
Continental and has been replaced by Hollis Harris, former
president of Delta Airlines.
   Some Continental shareholders have filed lawsuits in Delaware
Chancery Court asking that the transactions among Continental, Jet
Capital, Lorenzo and SAS be blocked. They argued the deals were
``entered into in breech of fiduciary duties owed to Continental
and Continental shareholders.''

   Continental Air
   Holders Sue to Stop
   Buy-Out of Lorenzo

   Several Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. shareholders
sued to stop the proposed purchase of Frank Lorenzo's stake
in the airline company by Scandinavian Airlines System.
   In addition to Mr. Lorenzo, who stepped down as chairman
and chief executive officer of Continental Holdings, the
plaintiffs also sued that company, its directors and Jet
Capital Corp., the tightly controlled holding company that
owns a special class of Continental Holdings stock. SAS was
not named in the suits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suits -- three of them filed in Delaware Chancery
Court and a fourth filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey
-- allege that Continental directors breached their fiduciary
duty by agreeing to a buy-out in which Mr. Lorenzo and Jet
Capital's other shareholders receive $14 to $18 apiece for
their shares. In American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Continental Holdings shares closed at $5.25, down
87.5 cents.
   Mr. Lorenzo agreed last week to sell all his stock in
Continental Holdings to SAS and to vacate his management
posts at both the holding company and its Continental
Airlines unit, although he will remain a director. Mr.
Lorenzo would receive more than $30 million, including $10.8
million for his shares in Jet Capital, and SAS would buy most
of his stock options, also at a premium. The transaction
would boost SAS's equity stake to 16.8% from 9.8%.
   The Delaware suits charge that Mr. Lorenzo would receive
amounts vastly exceeding the value of his stock options and
his employment contract. Similarly, the New Jersey suit
claims SAS is paying Mr. Lorenzo four times the value of his
equity. The New Jersey suits ask for unspecified damages and
all the suits seek to stop the transaction.
   A Continental Holdings spokesman said the company believes
the transaction to be proper, and that it was scrutinized by
attorneys and financial advisers for all the parties
involved. "We are confident the directors will be absolved of
any wrongdoing," he said.

   Hollis L. Harris, who succeeded Frank Lorenzo as head of
Continental Airlines, said the carrier will achieve the
consistent profitability that has eluded it, but he wouldn't
predict when.
   "You look at a carrier that has $5.5 billion in revenue,"
said Mr. Harris about Continental, "its service is a good
product and it has among the lowest relative seat-mile costs.
That airline, if we operate efficiently, ought to be able to
make a profit."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 58-year-old Mr. Harris resigned the presidency of
Delta Air Lines earlier this week to become president and
chief executive officer of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
and head of its airline unit.
   "My goal is to aggressively move forward on a more
streamlined and simplified basis," said Mr. Harris, who
wouldn't be more specific. Asked when the carrier will see
consistent quarterly profit, he simply smiled. "In the
future," he said.
   Mr. Lorenzo, an airline executive who spent much of the
past decade embroiled in high-profile, bitter disputes with
labor, agreed to sell most of his stake in Continental
Holdings to Scandinavian Airlines System and to step down as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Houston-based
airline holding company and as head of Continental.
   "I personally have become a lightning rod for many steps
that were required to build this company to what it is
today," Mr. Lorenzo said at a New York news conference.
   Word that Mr. Lorenzo had vacated his Continental Holdings
posts boosted the company's stock price to $6.25, up $1.75,
on volume of 2.4 million shares in trading on the American
Stock Exchange. The stock has suffered tremendously as the
holding company sustained massive losses, even during some of
the industry's most profitable quarters ever.
   Mr. Lorenzo and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive
of SAS, said the transaction would take this form: SAS would
acquire, for $21 million -- $10.8 million to Mr. Lorenzo --
all the stock outstanding in Jet Capital, a closely-held
investment vehicle that controls Continental Holdings through
a special class of stock. SAS also will pay Mr. Lorenzo $17
million for various other holdings and options, as well as
three years' salary, or another $2.7 million. SAS also will
pay $31.4 million to buy 2,250,000 Continental Holdings
shares.
   All told, SAS will increase its equity stake in
Continental Holdings to 16.8% from the current 9.9%. Its
voting control will be 18.4%. Federal law bars foreign
ownership of a U.S. airline of more than 25%.
   SAS would increase its representation on the 15-member
Continental Holdings board to three from one. Mr. Carlzon
would remain on the Continental board, and said he is
considering a post as its chairman, but with no operational
duties.
   The U.S. Transportation Department, which must approve the
transaction, has already requested additional financial
information. Securities analysts, however, expressed optimism
that the transaction will be cleared. They suggested that
Continental's case is helped by Mr. Lorenzo's unpopularity in
Washington, where he has been denounced by a number of
congressmen for his acriminous relations with labor unions.
   Richard Hillman, vice president, flight operations, at
Continental, confirmed for the carrier's pilots early
yesterday a story in The Wall Street Journal that said Mr.
Lorenzo was leaving. He added that Mr. Lorenzo "decided the
future of the company would be better served if he got his
name out of it."
   In the recorded message for the carrier's pilots, Mr.
Hillman suggested Mr. Lorenzo's absence might mean a "better
shot" at financing for Continental's multi-billion dollar
plane orders. "We've been having a little trouble getting
some financing for our airplanes," he added.
   A Continental spokesman wouldn't comment specifically on
what Mr. Hillman told the pilots.
   Mr. Harris's defection from Delta surprised many. That
carrier prides itself on a family-like atmosphere that keeps
employees from jumping ship as they often do at other
airlines. All but one of Delta's senior executives have spent
more than 20 years at the company. Under Mr. Lorenzo,
Continental Airlines had seven presidents in as many years.
   Mr. Harris spent 36 years at Delta, rising from gate agent
to president, with stops along the way in engineering,
facilities and flight operations.
   Neither, however, has he been so publicly vilified by
organized labor as was Mr. Lorenzo. Labor difficulties pushed
Eastern Airlines, then a unit of Continental Holdings'
predecessor, Texas Air Corp., into a crippling strike that
put the carrier into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. A
bankruptcy court judge subsequently took control of Eastern
from Mr. Lorenzo and his management team, appointing a
trustee.
   Union leaders who watched as Mr. Lorenzo successfully
vaporized thousands of jobs and slashed wages and benefits to
the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars were celebratory
yesterday. The International Machinists Union, taking note of
a non-compete clause with SAS that keeps Mr. Lorenzo out of
the airlines business for seven years, offered "our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next."

<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo, a central figure during a
tumultuous period in the airline industry and the bane of organized
labor, announced today he was getting out of the business.
   Lorenzo's Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. said he was selling
most of his stake in the company, formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., to Scandinavian Airlines System. He also will quit as
chairman and chief executive but will walk away with nearly $30
million in severance payments and sale proceeds.
   Lorenzo told reporters at a New York news briefing that he
decided to resign partly because the barrage of negative publicity
about his management practices was hurting the company's overall
performance.
   ``It's been obvious to me that I've become a lightning rod for
many of the attacks the company's taken,'' Lorenzo said. ``This
transaction allows me to step aside.''
   His departure marks the end of an era in the U.S. airline
industry, which has undergone sweeping changes since deregulation
more than a decade ago.
   Using billions of dollars in borrowed money, cheap fares and
bankruptcy laws to restructure high-cost airlines Continental and
Eastern, Lorenzo expanded his company to the nation's biggest
airline operator with about 20 percent of the domestic market.
   But Lorenzo has been bitterly criticized by airline unions,
which were driven from Continental and waged a bitter strike at
Eastern.
   Both airlines are under extreme financial pressure, and doubts
are widespread about Eastern's ability to survive.
   Lorenzo, 50, said he will be replaced as chief executive by
Hollis L. Harris, president of rival Delta Airlines. He called
Harris ``one of the industry's most experienced and highly regarded
executives.''
   Delta confirmed today that Harris, 58, left the company,
effective Wednesday, to assume a position with Continental. Delta
said Ronald W. Allen, its chairman, would take on Harris' duties.
   Lorenzo will immediately get about $17.13 million in cash. He
also will get $2.7 million over three years and $10 million from
SAS for his stake in Continental. But the $29.8 million total is
still only a franction of what he was worth a few years ago when
his airlines were in better shape.
   SAS, which first bought a stake in Lorenzo's business a few
years ago, said it was spending $50 million on the transaction,
which already was approved by Continental Holdings' board of
directors.
   Lorenzo became one of the most despised figures among union
groups in the 1980s because of what they called his brutal
treatment of organized labor.
   The most dramatic result: a strike at Eastern Airlines in March
1989 that prompted the carrier to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection from creditors while it reorganized.
   Lorenzo lost control of Eastern in April when federal bankruptcy
judge Judge Burton Lifland placed the airline in the hands of a
trustee, Martin Shugrue.
   Following that move, Lorenzo's company changed its name from
Texas Air to Continental Airlines Holdings, borrowing the name of
the airline that Lorenzo acquired in 1982 and continues to run.
   The sale of Lorenzo's stake would boost SAS's interest in
Continental Holdings to 16.8 percent in terms of equity and 18.4
percent in terms of voting control. SAS already holds 9.8 percent
of Continental Holdings and has a seat on the board.
   The transaction will require approval of the U.S. Department of
Transportation. It does not appear to violate laws limiting foreign
carriers to no more than a 25 percent stake in a U.S. airline.

   Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified
partner reportedly are involved in advanced talks with Texas Air
Corp. about buying all or part of the Houston company's Continental
Airlines subsidiary.
   The parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and
terms for some time, and now they have reached the point of trying
to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Late last week, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company
may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in
Continental. He said Texas Air officials had talked to interested
parties, but he gave no details.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said this morning he could
not confirm or deny the report.
   ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like this,'' Kent
said.
   He said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a serious
point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be an
appropriate disclosure.''
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline holding company, also
owns strikebound Eastern Airlines. The Miami-based carrier, which is
in the midst of bankruptcy reorganization, wouldn't be involved in
any transaction involving SAS.
   SAS, which currently has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part
of a marketing agreement, wouldn't be able to buy Continental
outright because of U.S. Transportation Department rules that
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent share
in a U.S. carrier.
   Talks between the parties are an outgrowth of meetings that began
between SAS and Continental officials in June 1988, when the two
began work on the joint marketing agreement. Those talks turned to
SAS possibly buying a stake in Continental, and that aspect has been
pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days, an unidentified
source told the Journal.
   The talks apparently heated up because of signs that
Houston-based Continental could remain profitable after massive
losses in 1987 and 1988 and the soaring value of airline stocks.
   SAS is 50 percent owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and
Norway. In Europe, its hub is Copenhagen.

   The unsecured creditors of Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. asked a bankruptcy court to let them sue Frank Lorenzo,
the former chairman who built the carrier with acquisitions
and debt, then sold his stake months before the company
sought bankruptcy-law protection.
   The creditors group charges that Mr. Lorenzo knew or
should have known that Continental Holdings was nearly
insolvent when he and another executive agreed to sell their
shares to Scandinavian Airlines System. The two executives
received $40 million in connection with that August 1990
transaction, the creditors said. Houstonbased Continental
stumbled into Chapter 11 protection the following December.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In their motion, made to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen S.
Balick of Delaware, the creditors said they would seek $180
million in compensatory and punitive damages from Mr. Lorenzo
and former Continental director Robert Snedeker, who also
sold his shares. Also named was Jet Capital Corp., a company
through which Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker held most of their
stake. The creditors' motion said they also want the
transaction voided. SAS wasn't named in the motion.
   The creditors also contend that the two men shaped the SAS
transaction so that the foreign carrier bought their stake
when it decided to double its Continental stake. That
deprived Continental of an opportunity to raise capital by
selling equity to SAS, the creditors said.
   Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker, in a statement, denied the
creditors' allegations. "The transactions that the creditors
are complaining about were perfectly appropriate and in the
best interests of Continental," said Mr. Lorenzo. He said he
and Mr. Snedeker have been advised by their attorneys that
the proposed creditor committee action is without merit.
   The creditors' move signals more of a "hardball" phase in
Continental's 14-month bankruptcy saga. It comes a week after
Continental and its unsecured creditors' committee proposed a
consensual reorganization plan that would wipe out
shareholder equity and eliminate about $5 billion in debt.
   The creditors' group yesterday also asked Judge Balick for
permission to recover $124 million from the Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corp. The creditors maintain that Continental
Holdings' transfer of that sum to the pension plans of
Eastern Airlines was an insider transaction that should be
voided under bankruptcy court rules. At the time, Eastern was
a unit of Continental Holdings, and its underfunded pension
plan was an obligation of the parent company. A Pension
Benefit Guarantee spokeswoman said the federal agency is
prepared to take aggressive legal action against the
creditors' motion. "This money belongs to Eastern's retirees
and the PBGC," she said.
   The proposed action against Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker
had been expected. The creditors' group had been seeking
since December to force the company itself to sue the two
men, and it twice altered its deadline to await Continental's
response. The last deadline was last Thursday, when according
to yesterday's filing Continental's board voted against
instituting such a suit but said it wouldn't oppose a
creditors' attempt to bring one. A Continental spokesman
declined to comment.
   In the motion, the creditors contended that Messrs.
Lorenzo and Snedeker breached their fiduciary duty when they
negotiated the SAS transaction and presented it to
Continental's board "as a fait accompli" in early July 1990.
Under the agreement, announced in August, SAS agreed to buy
2,250,000 newly issued shares of Continental Holdings common
for about $31 million. It also agreed to buy 100% of the
stock of Jet Capital, which held a substantial block of
Continental Holdings common, for about $21 million.
   At the time, Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker were "consummate
insiders," holding positions as officers and directors at
both Continental Holdings and Jet Capital, the filing said,
and they owned 80% of the latter company. As part of the SAS
transaction, Continental Holdings paid lump sums of $17.1
million to Mr. Lorenzo and $3.5 million to Mr. Snedeker, the
filing said, as well as unpaid salary, insurance, Continental
passes and other benefits. Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker
agreed to step down from their Continental positions as part
of their agreement.
   A hearing on the matter is scheduled for March 11.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Frank Lorenzo, who seized on deregulation to
build one of the nation's largest airline companies in a
series of controversial mergers, is leaving the industry that
he helped transform.
   Beaten by waves of bad publicity that have swept his
latest endeavors, Mr. Lorenzo is expected to announce as
early as today that he is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. (formerly Texas Air Corp.)
to Scandinavian Airlines System and stepping down as chairman
and chief executive officer, say people with knowledge of the
proposed move.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, Mr. Lorenzo would walk away with at
least $17 million, a large sum but a fraction of what he was
worth when his airlines were flying high. Industry sources
say he didn't want to sell his stake, but believed his
continued association with the company, and criticism of his
operating style, were hurting Continental's hopes for
recovery.
   Mr. Lorenzo has been a pioneer in the post-deregulation
airline industry, helping lead the way in merging carriers,
cutting fares and using bankruptcy protection to reorganize
and break up high-cost airlines. But his innovations brought
on debilitating labor strife, crippling debt loads and
another feature of the modern-day airline industry: service
problems.
   Now Mr. Lorenzo's latest airline deal appears to be his
last, at least for years to come. The proposed purchase would
raise SAS's interest in Continental Holdings to 16.8% in
terms of equity and 18.4% in terms of voting control. SAS
already owns 9.8% of Continental Holdings, and has a seat on
the company's board.
   SAS is said to be spending about $50 million on the
transaction, and is planning to install Hollis Harris, 58,
the president of Delta Air Lines, as president and CEO of
both Continental Holdings and Continental Airlines. Jan
Carlzon, SAS's chairman and a Continental director, would
become nonexecutive chairman of Continental Holdings. The
transaction requires approval from the U.S. Department of
Transportation but doesn't violate laws governing how big a
piece a foreign carrier may own of a U.S. airline. That limit
currently is 25%.
   A Continental spokesman declined to comment on the
proposed transaction. Lars Bergvall, SAS's chief operating
officer, said he had no comment.
   Under the agreement, SAS will buy out Mr. Lorenzo's
five-year employment contract, which calls for a base salary
of $365,000 a year plus bonuses and deferred compensation of
at least $570,000. SAS is also buying all the shares of Jet
Capital Corp., a personal investment company owned by Mr.
Lorenzo and two other investors, who are selling their stakes
as well. Jet Capital's chief investment is in Continental
Holdings shares. Since there is no public market for Jet
Capital shares, their value lies in the voting power they
exert over Continental Holdings.
   Finally, SAS plans to purchase, at a premium, Mr.
Lorenzo's options to buy two million or more Continental
Holdings shares. Mr. Lorenzo will retain some of those
options and will remain on the board of directors. Under a
non-compete clause in his employment contract, Mr. Lorenzo is
obliged to stay out of the airline business for at least
seven years.
   The transaction has already received approval from the
board of Continental Holdings, sources familiar with the
transaction say.
   SAS is paying $14 a share for 2.25 million Continental
Holdings shares, almost all of which come from Mr. Lorenzo
and his two Jet Capital partners. That price is sure to sting
other common holders who have watched Continental Holdings
shares slide to yesterday's close of $4.50 a share on the
American Stock Exchange, down from about $23 a year ago. SAS
apparently chose to pay the premium in order to get the
additional voting rights that Jet Capital holds. There are
about 40 million Continental Holdings shares outstanding.
   Controversy is certainly nothing new to Mr. Lorenzo where
airlines are concerned. Over the last three years, the
50-year-old executive has been routinely vilified by Eastern
Airlines unions as they mounted a tough campaign to fight his
attempts to lower labor costs at that former unit. The result
was a bruising strike begun in March 1989 that virtually
grounded Eastern and sent that carrier careening into Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, from which it still hasn't
emerged.
   Last April, the bankruptcy court judge, Burton R. Lifland,
took control of Eastern from Mr. Lorenzo, placing the carrier
in the hands of a trustee, Martin Shugrue Jr.
   That entire episode so demoralized the Texas Air empire
that it sought to distance itself from its past, changing its
name and severing all ties to Eastern. The body blows from
the Eastern affair also led to Mr. Lorenzo's decision to
leave the airline business, according to people who know him.
   The Eastern episode, which included critical headlines and
pickets outside Mr. Lorenzo's exclusive River Oaks home in
Houston, took a considerable toll on the intensely private
man and his family. He took to hiring bodyguards.
   That was in marked contrast to the Frank Lorenzo who
wrested control of Continental in 1982 in the nation's first
hostile takeover of an airline. Mr. Lorenzo, a graduate of
Harvard University's business school, had been looking for
ways to expand his Texas International Airlines, a small
regional carrier. At the time, Continental was a staid
carrier and money-loser.
   Within four years, Mr. Lorenzo had thrust the airline into
bankruptcy court, abrogated its union contracts and lowered
labor costs. He built back its operations until, in 1986, it
emerged from Chapter 11 protection having turned a profit.
   With low costs, Continental lured flyers by offering lower
fares, and a new generation of travelers took to the skies.
   But the growth of Continental itself has been anything but
steady, and Mr. Lorenzo discovered it was easier to build an
airline than to run it. Continental's top management has been
in constant turmoil, with seven chief executives in as many
years.
   But that didn't stop the acquisition-minded Mr. Lorenzo.
Riding high on deregulation, he and his Texas Air Corp. went
on to acquire People Express and Frontier and Eastern, all of
which were financially troubled. Texas Air already owned New
York Air. In 1987, Mr. Lorenzo folded all the airlines,
except for Eastern, into Continental, a merger that became
one of the airline industry's most difficult and costly.
   Continental's expansion, funded by junk bonds, was driven
by an ever-growing mound of debt, and was shaky at best. With
his new holdings, Mr. Lorenzo's empire -- briefly the largest
airline in the free world -- began to feel the full weight of
its debt: Texas Air rolled up . . . the airline industry's
largest losses ever in 1988 and 1989 -- $718.6 million and
$885.6 million, respectively.
   Mr. Lorenzo eventually broke the strike at Eastern, but
lost the airline. The labor action, mounted by Eastern's
machinists and supported by flight attendants and pilots, not
only forced Eastern into Chapter 11 protection but kept Mr.
Lorenzo in the spotlight: Angry strikers picketed the
nation's airports, handing out buttons and bumper stickers
emblazoned with the words, "Stop Lorenzo."
   But unlike his experience with Continental, Mr. Lorenzo
would not ride Eastern out of bankruptcy. After listening to
ever-smaller offers of repayment, Eastern's creditors ousted
Mr. Lorenzo and Texas Air from day-to-day control of Eastern.
   Texas Air changed its name to Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc. in June. But the parent still is on the hook
for Eastern's pension debt, which could total nearly half a
billion dollars. While Continental has made a dramatic
financial turnaround from last year and the year before, much
of its net income comes from one-time gains such as lawsuit
settlements and asset sales. Its debt service costs remain
high, and eat up much of its operating profits.
   For its part, SAS is 50% owned by the governments of
Sweden, Denmark and Norway. SAS's initial purchase of a 10%
stake in Continental, as well as a marketing agreement with
the carrier back in October 1988, has yielded many benefits.
Passenger traffic between May and December 1989 was up 40%
out of Stockholm and 100% out of Oslo, mostly because of
transfers at Continental's Newark hub.
   The company in recent years has undertaken a broad
expansion program, of which Continental is just a part.
   It now has equity stakes in Inter-Continental Hotels Corp.
(40%), Finnair (estimated 6%) and Swissair (5% to 10%, to be
finalized by the end of 1991). It bought a 24.9% stake in
Airlines of Britain PLC and 35% in LAN Chile. SAS also is in
the market for as many as 126 new MD-90s or A-320/A-321s
airplanes.
   Like other European carriers in highwage home markets, SAS
is having problems with costs. SAS has a hiring freeze and
has sold some ancillary businesses. Now its ambitious
expansion plans are being scaled back. Lars Bergvall, the
chief operating officer, said planned additions to the
airline's New York, Seattle and Los Angeles routes will be
scrapped, as will some other proposed route additions. SAS
has frozen its European fleet at its current size, and three
DC-9s are being sold earlier than planned.

   WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department approved
Scandinavian Airlines System's proposal to purchase Frank
Lorenzo's stake in Continental Airlines Holdings.
   SAS and Continental, which is the parent company of
Continental Airlines, announced SAS's proposed acquisition of
Mr. Lorenzo's stockholdings on Aug. 9. The transaction would
boost SAS's equity stake to 16.8%.

   The department said that, upon completion of the
transaction, Continental would continue to be "fit" to
operate an airline. In addition, it said the transaction
complies with federal laws requiring that U.S. carriers
remain under the control of U.S. citizens.
   Mr. Lorenzo would receive more than $30 million for his
shares.

suit against Lorenzo

<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier and one in
bankruptcy since late 1990, have filed a suit against Mr Frank Lorenzo, the
airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the
official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages.
Mr Lorenzo, known as a pugnacious union-buster and wily deal-maker, quit as
Continental's boss in August 1990, although he remained a director. At that
stage, he also sold the privately-owned Jet Capital company - in which he
and other Jet Capital directors had an 80 per cent stake - to Scandinavian
Airlines System.
Jet Capital, in turn, held a big stake in Continental, and SAS ended up with
18.4 per cent of Continental's voting rights.
However, before the end of 1990, Continental had sought protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - a situation which still exists,
although the airline has now filed a reorganisation scheme with the courts.
Under this proposed plan, ordinary shareholders in the airline would get
nothing - rendering SAS's equity stake worthless.
The creditors' lawsuit alleges that Mr Lorenzo, Jet Capital and Mr Robert
Snedeker, another Continental director, received Dollars 41.6m as a result
of the series of transactions with SAS in August 1990. It suggests that the
payments were made when Continental was already insolvent, breaching Mr
Lorenzo's and Mr Snedeker's duties as directors of the company. It also
argues that Mr Lorenzo and Mr Snedeker benefited from a preferential
transfer which preceded the SAS deal.
The creditors' committee stressed that SAS was not a defendant in the suit.
Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches
of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer.
Mr Lorenzo's Houston-based investment company said the businessman believed
the actions cited in the creditors' complaint were 'perfectly appropriate
and in the best interests of Continental'. It added that Mr Lorenzo and Mr
Snedeker has been advised by lawyers that the suit was 'totally without
merit'.

<TEXT>
   Airline boss Frank Lorenzo said Thursday he's
quitting the flying empire he built in the 1980s, hurt by a barrage
of bad publicity and labor bitterness about his tough-guy
management style.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. to Scandinavian Airlines System.
The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake in Houston-based
Continental for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President Hollis L. Harris.
Harris, a highly respected manager, was lured to Continental after
a discreet search that started four months ago.
   Lorenzo will receive nearly $30 million in severance, retain a
small interest in Continental's stock options and keep a seat on
the company's board of directors.
   But Lorenzo's influence in running the company virtually will
disappear and his compensation reflects a fraction of the value the
airline operation used to have in better times.
   Houston-based Continental Holdings, formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., once commanded 20 percent of the domestic airline market
through its ownership of Continental and Eastern airlines.
   But its business has been severely crimped by heavy debts and a
debilitating strike at Eastern that's now 17 months old. Last year
the parent company lost $885.6 million, an industry record.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, Lorenzo said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   He spoke to reporters at a New York news briefing, flanked by
Hollis and SAS Chairman Jan Carlzon. All three called the
arrangement a strategic move that would strengthen Continental into
a global airline for the 1990s.
   SAS, which is spending a total of $50 million in the deal, will
roughly double its stake to 18.4 percent of the company's voting
stock. Carlzon said SAS had no interest in gaining control of the
airline. Federal law already limits foreign ownership is limited to
25 percent.
   ``We think Continental has an interesting future,'' Carlzon
said. ``It's better to have 18.4 percent than 9.9 percent.''
   Wall Street reacted positively to the announcement, reflecting
investor optimism that the change would help Continental's business
improve.
   Its stock, which traded as high as $23.75 a share over the past
year but recently traded in the $4-5 range, rose $1.75 on the
American Stock Exchange in active trading to $6.75.
   Lorenzo's exit from the airline world marks the end of an era
that in many ways was shaped by him. From his initial plunge into
the flying business in the 1960s as an analyst for Trans World
Airlines and later as an executive of a small Texas airline
company, Lorenzo helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate
fares to the industry's first hostile takeover.
   But Lorenzo aroused labor hatred because of what unions called
his brutal tactics to cut employee costs, one of the biggest
expenses in the industry besides fuel.
   Lorenzo called his strategies necessary to stay profitable in
deregulated skies that allowed airlines to set their own fares and
fly wherever they wished _ enormous changes in an industry unused
to competition.
   His war with labor began after he won Continental Airlines in a
takeover bid in 1981. Two years later he plunged the airline into
bankruptcy court, scrapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for striking workers.
   Lorenzo's reputation among unionists worsened after he bought
unprofitable Eastern Airlines in 1986. Three years later angry
unions struck, accusing Lorenzo of gutting the airline.
   He responded by placing Eastern in bankruptcy court, but its
enormous debts and enduring strike crippled the carrier and made
creditors increasingly edgy. Last April an irritated federal
bankruptcy judge gave control of Eastern to a trustee, which many
strikers regarded as vindication.
   Unionists reacted to Lorenzo's announcement Thursday with a mix
of satisfaction and resentment. The International Association of
Machinists, which has led the Eastern strike from the start, said
he was largely responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``Frank Lorenzo demolished Eastern Airlines, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued Continental
Airlines,'' said John Peterpaul, IAM general vice president.
``Those facts dampen our elation at seeing Lorenzo finally leaving
the industry. He is the epitome of what is wrong with corporate
America today.
   ``Our condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''

Continental sale.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., which is considering a sale of
part or all of its Continental Airlines subsidiary, reportedly is
involved in advanced talks about such a transaction with
Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified partner.
   Talks about the form of a possible sale and the terms have been
going on for some time, and the parties have reached the point of
trying to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported
in Monday's editions.
   A Texas Air spokesman, however, would not confirm that any such
talks have taken place.
   ``I can't confirm or deny anything,'' spokesman Art Kent told The
Associated Press. ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like
this.''
   Kent said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a
serious point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be
an appropriate disclosure.''
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo announced last Thursday that the
Houston-based airline company _ the largest in the nation _ may
consider selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental.
Strikebound Eastern Airlines is Texas Air's other airline
subsidiary, but it would not be involved in any Continental
transaction.
   Lorenzo said Texas Air officials have spoken to parties
interested in Continental, but he has not provided any details about
the talks.
   SAS already has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part of a
marketing agreement.
   If SAS is interested in buying part of Houston-based Continental,
the transaction would have to be structured in such a way that SAS
would get a minority holding. Department of Transportation rules
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent stake
in a U.S. carrier.
   Talks that began in June 1988 concerning the Texas Air marketing
agreement apparently turned to SAS possibly buying part of
Continental. That aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in
the past 30 days, an unidentified source told the Journal.
   Signs that Continental could remain profitable after massive
losses in 1987 and 1988, as well as the soaring value of airline
stocks, apparently heated up the discussions.
   Lorenzo's surprise announcement came a week after a Boston
investment firm disclosed that it holds 12 percent of Texas Air.
Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., a Boston portfolio management company, has
said its 12 percent stake was held for investment because it
believed Texas Air would show a profit in 1990.
   The possible sale of Continental could doom Eastern, according to
securities analysts and labor leaders.
   Miami-based Eastern is in the sixth month of a strike by
Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants, and is
flying about a third of its pre-strike 1,100 daily flights.
   ``We've always believed that the plan was to shrink Eastern and
roll it into Continental,'' said Louis A. Marchesano, an analyst
with the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   ``The sale of Continental would mean Eastern would have to make
it on its own,'' Marchesano said Monday, ``and the risk of a
shrunken Eastern not making it is substantial.''
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy
shortly after the walkout began in March, is losing more than $1.5
million a day.
   The sale of Continental, according to Marchesano, would mean
Lorenzo ``might be leaving the airline business.''
   The Miami spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, Ron
Cole, agreed, saying that the Texas Air chairman ``may be cutting
and running.''
   A Texas Air without Continental, Cole said, would have only two
options _ continued liquidation of Eastern assets or the outright
sale of the carrier.
   Striking Eastern employees have repeatedly charged that Lorenzo
has been transferring Eastern assets to Continental, weakening
Eastern and strengthening Continental.
   ``Now that the bankruptcy has thrown a net around Eastern's
assets and stopped the upstreaming of cash,'' Cole said, ``Lorenzo
has to admit that Continental can't go it alone, that it can't
survive without sponging off Eastern.''

Dollars 3bn

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, one of the five largest US carriers, is seeking more
than Dollars 3bn in fresh equity and cash to restructure its debt-burdened
balance-sheet and help it out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months.
Mr Hollis Harris, the new chairman of the airline which filed for protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code last December,
said he was seeking the conversion of about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt
into equity.
The airline currently has total unsecured debts of Dollars 2.5bn and secured
debts of Dollars 4.5bn.
Mr Harris, the former Delta Airlines president brought in to rescue
Continental, said it was planning to raise an additional Dollars 600m in new
equity from three or four investor groups.
The company has had discussions with business representatives at its three
US hubs of Houston, Denver and Newark, New Jersey.
At the same time, Continental is in advanced talks to sell a controlling
interest in its Air Micronesia operation in the Pacific for about Dollars
300m. But Mr Harris emphasised Continental would continue to be closely
involved in the operation in which it intended to retain a 49 per cent
interest.
The airline is also expecting to raise about Dollars 80m this year from the
sale of its Chelsea air catering company. It has already sold its Seattle to
Tokyo route to American Airlines for Dollars 150m.
All these transactions coupled with the restructuring of the company
aircraft operating and capital leases are designed to reconstruct the
company's balance sheet and provide additional capital to expand the
airline.
Mr Harris stressed that Continental had to find a way not to shrink its
operations. The airline has 350 aircraft in its fleet and has 190 new Boeing
and Airbus jets on order.
'We must grow the airline as we come out of Chapter 11 (protection). We
cannot cut back. We have to grow and maintain market share if we are to
compete with the other big carriers,' he said.
But he acknowledged that the financial restructuring if successful was
likely to dilute significantly current shareholders' equity. This would
include Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) which currently owns 16.8 per
cent of Continental shares and 18.3 per cent of voting rights.
'Their holding will automatically be reduced significantly under the
restructuring,' Mr Harris said. But he added that he expected SAS to invest
additional funds in Continental. 'We have a good relationship and I believe
they want to be a partner with us,' Mr Harris said.
Continental reported this week a sizeable first-quarter loss of Dollars
194.8m compared with a Dollars 21.3m profit in the same quarter last year.

   Here are key events in the evolution of Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., formerly known as Texas Air Corp., which filed for
protection from creditors Monday under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws.
   1934 - Varney Speed lines is formed in El Paso, Texas, with four
Lockheed Vega aircraft flying round trips to Denver. Earnings in
the first two weeks total $261.69 from nine paying customers.
   1937 - Varney is renamed Continental Airlines. Its eight
employees relocate to Denver.
   1968 - Continental opens routes to the South Pacific.
   1972 - Airline entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, future boss of
Continental, acquires Texas International Airlines.
   1976 - Texas International offers ``Peanut Fares,'' the
precursor to the discount fares that would spread throughout the
industry after deregulation in 1978.
   1980 - Lorenzo creates Texas Air Corp., parent of Texas
International, headquartered in Houston.
   1981 - Texas Air gains control of Continental Airlines.
   1983 - Continental employees strike, accusing Lorenzo of unfair
tactics to drive down costs. The airline, losing $1 million a day,
files for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws. Employment drops from more than 12,000 a year
earlier to 4,000.
   1984 - Using nonstrikers and new hires, Continental resurrects
much of its pre-strike operations. Lorenzo builds reputation as
anti-union manager.
   1985 - Continental begins first European service. Lorenzo loses
a bid to buy Trans World Airlines as its employees, fearing his
union hostility, support takeover by investor Carl Icahn.
   1986 - Continental re-emerges from bankruptcy with a plan to
fully repay all debts. Employment reaches 14,500 and aircraft fleet
totals 200, double the pre-bankruptcy level. Parent Texas Air
acquires Eastern Airlines as well as remnants of People Express and
Frontier, making it the largest airline operator in the country
with 20 percent of the market.
   1987 - Continental's employment reaches 24,500 and fleet totals
more than 300 jets serving 140 destinations. Lorenzo introduces
``Maxsaver'' discount fares and announces plans to cut labor costs
at Eastern.
   1988 - Texas Air undertakes joint venture with Scandinavian
Airline System, the beginning of a growing relationship between the
two companies. Texas Air also shows the effects of fare-cutting and
debt-financed spending spree, losing $466.2 million in 1987 vs.
earnings of $72.7 million a year earlier.
   1989 - Lorenzo rejects Eastern union demands in contract
negotiations, workers strike, Texas Air puts Eastern under
bankruptcy-court protection and begins to sell many of its assets.
Parent company loses $885.6 million for the year, an industry
record. Lorenzo insists he'll remain in the airline business
despite speculation he might get out.
   January-February 1990 - Texas Air drastically reduces proposal
for repaying Eastern creditors and faces increased trouble in
bankruptcy court.
   April 1990 - Lorenzo loses control of Eastern to court-appointed
trustee. Texas Air is renamed Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
   August 1990 - Lorenzo resigns as chairman and chief executive
and sells most of his Continental holdings to Scandinavian Airlines
System. He remains a board member.
   November 1990 - Continental denies speculation it will file for
bankruptcy but concedes the board considered the move. Airline puts
some prized routes up for sale to raise cash. Lorenzo predicts that
trouble in the airline industry could leave just three or four
carriers dominating within a few years.
   Dec. 3, 1990 - Continental files for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, blaming the move on
excessive debt and high fuel costs.

   Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified partner are the investors interested in buying all or part of Continental Airlines from Texas Air Corp., and talks are at an advanced stage, according to those familiar with the situation. 

   Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo disclosed late last week that he would consider selling a stake in the Continental unit, but didn't give any details. 

   A spokesman for SAS in Stockholm refused to comment, as did a spokesman for Houston-based Texas Air. 

   It's still not known who SAS's partner is, how much money may be involved or what percentage of ownership in Continental is being discussed. 

   But the parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and terms for some time, and now have reached the point of trying to draft a letter of intent, according to one source. 
Currently, SAS holds a 9.9% stake in Texas Air as part of the marketing arrangement with Continental and Texas Air announced last fall. 

   The talks are an outgrowth of meetings that began between SAS and Continental officials in June 1988, when the two began work on the joint marketing agreement. 
Those talks turned to SAS and its partner possibly buying a stake in Continental, and that aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days, the source said. 

   It is understood that the talks heated up of late because of signs that Continental could remain profitable after massive losses in 1987 and 1988 and the soaring value of airline stocks. 
Most airline stocks have taken off this year in the wake of a $3.5 billion buy-out of NWA Inc., Northwest Airlines' parent, and a $6.19 billion offer for UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines. 

   Texas Air's stock price has doubled since Jan. 1, but Wall Street appeared to react cautiously to the disclosure that Texas Air might sell a piece or all of Continental. 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Texas Air rose only 87.5 cents to $20.875, on volume of 2,117,000 shares. 

   Eastern Airlines, Texas Air's other airline unit, now in bankruptcy proceedings, wouldn't be involved in any Continental transaction. 
From time to time there has been speculation that Mr. Lorenzo might eventually try to merge Continental with ailing Eastern, which is trying to revive its flight operations after a bitter strike that led to its bankruptcy filing in March. 

   SAS itself wouldn't be able to buy Continental outright because of U.S. Transportation Department rules that prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25% stake in a U.S. airline. 
So, any transaction that might come of current talks would have to be structured in a way that SAS has a minority holding. 

   That means if a deal is pursued, its structure might be similar to the sale last month of NWA, according to someone familiar with the SAS-Texas Air talks. 
Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi bought NWA with some equity financing from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia, who contributed $480 million. 
The two foreign airlines came out with less than 20% of the voting interest in the new company because most of their stake is held in preferred stock. 

   SAS's purchase of its 9.9% stake in parent Texas Air last year was a friendly transaction. 
SAS paid $56 million for the stock, and agreed to pay Texas Air an additional $50 million over several months as the agreement goes into effect. 
SAS chairman Jan Carlzon also sits on Texas Air's board. 

   Mr. Carlzon apparently believes he made the right decision to link up with Continental, according to one person who discussed the move with him recently. 
But, that source said, in the same conversation Mr. Carlzon conceded that he was concerned about the negative view many people have of the tough-minded Mr. Lorenzo, his Texas Air empire, and Eastern. 
Separating Continental from Eastern might solve part of that problem for SAS. 

   SAS is 50%-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. 
In Europe, its hub is Copenhagen. 
Since purchasing the Texas Air stake last October, SAS has operated in the U.S. out of Continental's new terminal at Newark international airport in New Jersey. 
The two airlines coordinate schedules, frequent-flier programs and sales forces. 
SAS also runs a training program for Continental. 

   SAS is preparing for the competition expected in Europe after market barriers come down there in 1992. 
Anticipating a frenzy of activity similar to what occurred in the U.S. after deregulation, SAS is seeking alliances that may bring it passengers. 
Since October, SAS has bought 24.9% of Airlines of Britain PLC, owner of four U.K. carriers and 40% of Intercontinental Hotels Corp., from Japan's Seibu/Saison Group. 

   SAS also is backing an investor group trying to buy 51% of Chilean flag carrier LAN Chile from the Chilean government. 
SAS options could give it 35% of that carrier by 1991. 
SAS has loose marketing agreements with Thai Airways International and All Nippon Airways and owns 25% of the European Amadeus computer reservations system.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo has met
with Donald J. Trump in an effort to persuade the New York developer
to buy Continental Airlines, a Trump associate said Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Trump have spoken,'' said Bruce Nobles,
president of Trump Shuttle, which the developer purchased from
Lorenzo last June for $365 million.
   But Trump has concerns about a potential purchase of Continental,
a subsidiary of Texas Air, Nobles said, noting that Trump is
concerned about Continental's $2.5 billion debt, its small cash
reserves and the need to refurbish many of its planes.
   While Trump remains interested and believes his name would help
the Houston-based carrier win passengers, he has not been convinced
that the risks are acceptable, Nobles said in a telephone interview.
   ``His (Trump's) concerns are well put,'' said Nobles, a former
Texas Air and Pan Am Corp. official.
   Trump was unavailable for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said.
Art Kent, a Texas Air spokesman in Houston, said Lorenzo had no
comment on the matter.
   In talks with Trump, said to have been held over the past month,
Lorenzo said his negative image has hurt Continental, according to
sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of the New York Times.
   Lorenzo announced last Thursday that Houston-based Texas Air, the
nation's largest airline company, may consider selling a minority or
controlling interest in Continental.
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, Texas Air's other airline
subsidiary, apparently would not be involved in any Continental
transaction.
   Last week, Lorenzo told The Associated Press that one reason he
was considering selling a stake in Continental was that the bitter
struggle with Eastern's unions had hurt traffic at Continental.
   Texas Air is also involved in talks about selling a major stake
in Continental to Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified
partner, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Texas Air declined
to comment on the report.
   SAS already has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part of a
joint marketing agreement.
   Sources were quoted by the Times as saying that Lorenzo was
impressed with the way traffic on the former Eastern Air Shuttle in
the Northeast picked up since Trump bought it.
   Trump's share of the lucrative Northeast shuttle market, split
with Pan Am, has ``approximately doubled since we took over,''
Nobles said. Although he declined to give precise figures, he said
Trump Shuttle's market share has jumped from around 25 percent when
it started operations in early June to about 50 percent currently.
   ``I think being separated from Eastern is a positive; having the
Trump name is a positive; having better service is a positive,''
Nobles said.
   But rival Pan Am disputed Nobles' estimate of current market
share. Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the Pan Am Shuttle's
share, at around 75 percent when Trump started up, is now holding at
roughly 60 percent.
   ``We're quite pleased with the clientele that we think we've been
able to keep since they started,'' she said.
   The Times quoted its sources as saying that SAS favored a deal
with Continental involving Trump.
   SAS board member Kaj Ikast said Tuesday that the carrier was not
near a decision on taking a stake in Continental. Ikast told the
Times there have been talks with Texas Air about buying such a stake.

   A team of lawyers spent the weekend preparing a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for Continental Airlines, but the
carrier's board is split on how to deal with its financial
troubles, according to a published report.
   In its early Wednesday edition, The New York Times quotes an
attorney, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying the papers
were ready to be filed in bankruptcy court Monday morning.
   The airline denied the report.
   ``The company has no intention of filing for bankruptcy
protection,'' said Art Kent, a spokesman for Continental.
   Continental suffered losses during the normally busy summer
travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel prices since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the newspaper said.
   Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman of
Continental but remains on the board, opposes a Chapter 11 filing
by the airline, the Times said. Also, Jan Carlzon, chairman of
Scandavian Airlines System, which owns 16.8 percent of Continental
stock, opposes filing for bankruptcy, the newspaper quoted the
lawyer as saying.
   A filing would reduce the value of SAS's holdings.
   The newspaper said it was not clear which board members support
filing for bankruptcy protection.
   On Tuesday, Continental said it has moved to cut costs by
restructuring its senior management team, cutting five top
executives.
   The board of directors for the Houston-based airline approved
the restructuring plan on Monday.
   ``With radically higher fuel costs, Continental must become a
stronger competitor in the global marketplace,'' said Hollis
Harris, Continental's chairman and chief executive officer. ``We
have reaffirmed our intention to become a preferred airline among
frequent travelers around the world.''
   Harris was given the additional role of president, replacing
Mickey Foret, who is leaving the company to pursue other interests,
officials said.
   Also leaving the carrier will be Neal Neehan, senior vice
president-customer services; Clark Omstad, senior vice
president-properties and government affairs; Jim Arpey, senior vice
president-aircraft programs; and Elliott Seiden, vice president and
associate general counsel for Continental Airlines Holdings, Inc.
   Continental named Thomas Kalil senior vice president-customer
service and announced Lewis Jordan, executive vice president and
system general manager, was given the additional responsibility for
managing the company's international division.
   ``These actions position Continental with a lean and efficient
management structure that reflects the realities of operating
during this fuel crisis,'' Harris said.

Continental Airlines announced the resignation of five top executives in what

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- A bankruptcy judge ruled that the
unsecured creditors of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. can
sue former Chairman Frank Lorenzo and another executive to
recover money they received for selling their shares four
months before the company's bankruptcy-law filing in late
1990.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen S. Balick's action wasn't a
ruling on the merits of the case, merely the green light
necessary under bankruptcy court rules to proceed with it.
The action stems from Scandinavian Airlines System's purchase
of Continental shares owned by Mr. Lorenzo and Robert
Snedeker, another director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The creditors claim the transaction deprived Continental
of an opportunity to sell equity to SAS at a time when the
company needed additional equity. In addition, they claim
that Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker knew, or should have known,
that Continental was technically insolvent when it paid them
about $20 million to buy out their employment contracts.
   The creditors are seeking $180 million in compensatory and
punitive damages from the two men and Jet Capital Corp.,
through which they held most of their stake. Mr. Lorenzo said
the transactions were "appropriate and in the best interests
of Continental."
   Judge Balick also allowed the creditors to seek recovery
of $124 million from the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. The agency has said it will oppose the creditors'
motion.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Friday he was considering a sale of Continental Airlines because the
``noise'' at strike-torn Eastern Airlines was hurting the sister
carrier's business.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Lorenzo said the sale
of part or all of Houston-based Continental was under discussion
partly because of the negative impact from Eastern's bitter strike
and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' Lorenzo said
in his New York office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (Continental) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in Miami.''
   He made the surprise announcement about Continental late Thursday
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on
Continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter,
said Lorenzo, whose Texas Air is the parent of the two carriers.
Continental showed a net profit of $32.1 million in the quarter,
compared with a loss of $150.9 million a year earlier.
   Continental could benefit from ``distance'' from Eastern, Lorenzo
said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer Donald Trump
bought it from Eastern in early June for $365 million.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of Continental
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at Eastern and Continental's reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, Texas Air stock has
soared from around $9 or $10 a share at the beginning of the year to
over $20 currently. It rose 87{ cents Friday to close at $20.75 on
the American Stock Exchange, after jumping as high as $22.25.
   Possible buyers of Continental or part of it could include
Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in
Texas Air, and Pan Am Corp., which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., may be interested in a combination with Continental.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including SAS or another foreign carrier.
   SAS spokeswoman Barbara Levites and Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon, both in New York, declined comment on the matter Friday. An
Icahn associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
Continental a hot property.
   A group led by California investor Alfred Checchi recently
acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $4 billion, while
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is being ardently pursued by
investor Marvin Davis, British Airways PLC and others.

CONTINENTAL AIR REPORTS LOSS OF $88.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Continental Airlines Holdings, which considered bankruptcy two weeks ago, said 
Tuesday that it lost $88.3 million in the third quarter on revenue of $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, the Houston-based parent of Continental and Eastern airlines, 
blamed high fuel costs and soft travel demand for much of the loss. 
Continental's results were also hurt by a $17-million severance payment to 
former Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who agreed in August to sell his Continental 
stock and options to Scandinavian Airlines Systems at nearly three times the 
market price. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said its results were hurt by a $15-million expense related to the 
SAS transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Tuesday that Continental's results were in line 
with expectations. Other airlines, including Delta and USAir, have reported 
large fuel-related third-quarter losses. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Chairman Hollis Harris said in a statement that fuel costs 
"exacerbated our losses." He said fuel had surpassed wages as the airline's 
greatest expense, and that Continental's fuel bill in October was $70 million 
higher than in normal times. Jet fuel prices have risen dramatically since 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's difficult financial situation caused it to consider, but reject, 
a bankruptcy filing two weeks ago. The company instead said it would sell 
assets to raise money and look for help from a possible investor. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, the airline said it was taking its valuable Honolulu-Tokyo 
route off the market. The airline had said earlier that it might sell its Air 
Micronesia unit, which holds the governmental authority to fly from Honolulu to 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's third-quarter loss doesn't include results of its Eastern 
Airlines subsidiary. Eastern, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, has been run 
by a court-appointed trustee since April 10. Continental lost $158 million on 
revenue of $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 1989, a period when Eastern 
posted huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1990, the company lost $97 million on revenue of 
$4.9 billion. That compares to a loss of $522.8 million on revenue of $5 
billion in the first nine months of 1989. Continental released the earnings 
statement after the markets closed. The company's stock closed up 12 1/2 cents 
at $2.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines' board of directors briefly
considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but decided instead to
seek other ways to return to financial health, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Unidentified sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of The New
York Times and The Wall Street Journal said a team of lawyers
worked through the weekend to prepare Chapter 11 papers to be filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after a board meeting on Monday.
   Continental responded to the reports by issuing a statement
Wednesday saying it had no plans to file for protection from
creditors.
   ``We have streamlined our management, and like the rest of the
industry, are considering other prudent business steps to assist
during the fuel crisis,'' the airline said. ``However, Chapter 11
is not one of the means we intend to take.''
   Later Wednesday, spokesman Ned Walker said, ``The board examined
several different options, one of which was Chapter 11. But it was
rejected in a unanimous vote by the board.
   ``Chapter 11 just doesn't make sense for us. We have a lot of
alternatives,'' Walker said.
   They include possible asset sales, introduction of outside
investors and cost controls, such as the postponement of a
multimillion-dollar image campaign, he said.
   Continental stock dropped 1| to $4 per share Wednesday on the
American Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
had downgraded its ratings on debt of Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. and Continental Airlines, because of problems brought on by
higher fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel.
   The airline decided last week to remove 17 aircraft that were no
longer fuel efficient from service on Dec. 1 and replace them with
more efficient models. Walker said jet fuel costs have risen 125
percent since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   A $1.2 billion order for 25 Boeing 757s will still go through,
he added.
   ``We're in discussions with some parties that are seriously
interested in investing'' in Continental, Walker said.
   Continental's core operations ``remain strong,'' he said.
   ``Speculation that efforts to contain costs might include a
major downsizing of the airline is just that - speculation,'' the
airline's statement said.
   The reports that Continental had considered bankruptcy surfaced
a day after the carrier realigned its senior management team by
cutting five top executives in an effort to trim costs.
   For the first half of the year, Continental, which until June
was known as Texas Air Corp., lost $8.7 million, compared with a
loss of $365 million in the period a year ago. In June the
carrier's liabilities totaled $1.6 billion.
   Third-quarter results, which have not yet been reported, are
expected to show that Continental suffered losses during the
normally busy summer travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel
prices since the invasion of Kuwait.
   Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman of
Continental but remains on the board, reportedly opposes a Chapter
11 filing by the airline, as does Jan Carlzon, chairman of
Scandinavian Airlines System, which owns 16.8 percent of
Continental stock. A bankruptcy petition filing would reduce the
value of SAS's holdings.

FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental brushes up its image
 -The airline's moves towards regaining financial health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A jet in the new Continental Airlines white, blue and gold livery was parked
in the humid sunshine at one of the gates of Houston's new international
airport terminal last week.
It was one of the first 12 airliners to be repainted in the Houston-based
carrier's new colours.
Over the next three years, the entire fleet of 350 aircraft will be
repainted and refurbished as part of Continental's efforts to renew its
image and return to financial health.
'We know we are not out of the woods yet, ' said Mr Hollis Harris, the
former Delta Airlines president who replaced Mr Frank Lorenzo as chairman of
Continental last September.
'It's not going to be easy, but I believe this country needs four or five
major carriers in the market place. I believe we will be one of those,' he
told journalists flown in from around the world to see Continental's new
corporate identity.
Since December, Continental has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code.
It sought protection from its creditors to enable it to restructure its
heavily indebted balance sheet. It is now in the midst of a complex
financial restructuring exercise.
Mr Harris hopes it will enable the airline, the fifth largest carrier in the
US, to fly out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months.
Many US airline analysts believe Continental has a reasonable chance of
pulling through, although much will depend on the length and depth of the US
recession, the speed and vigour of the recovery in air travel and the
success of the company's financial restructuring.
Mr Harris said when he landed at Continental he was impressed by the
airline's route structure, its staff and its overall potential. 'But the
financial situation was worse than I thought', he explained.
His original plan was to avoid filing for Chapter 11. He felt this would be
bad for staff morale since Continental had already been through a Chapter 11
bankruptcy in 1983 under Mr Lorenzo.
Instead, he put several Continental assets up for sale and his former
airline, Delta, showed interest in buying Continental's extensive Pacific
operations. But with the economy weakening, rising fuel prices and the
impact of the Gulf conflict, Delta decided not to go ahead with a
substantial offer for the Pacific routes.
High fuel prices were also putting pressure on Continental. By December, Mr
Harris said, the company decided there was no alternative but to file for
Chapter 11.
However, Mr Harris adopted a radically different approach to the company's
previous Chapter 11 filing. Instead of launching a sweeping programme of job
cuts and internal restructurings, he adopted a 'business as usual' strategy.
The airline would continue to operate normally, while restructuring its
balance sheet. 'The plan was first to make the airline profitable and then
work to bring in additional capital to expand the airline,' Mr Harris said.
This month Continental reported a deeper first-quarter loss of Dollars 195m.
against a profit of Dollars 21m in the first quarter of last year. But Mr
Harris maintained the company had operated well since the filing, and with
traffic picking up again, he expected the airline to be operating in the
black in July.
But the financial restructuring poses a considerable challenge. The plan is
to convert about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt into equity to reduce the
overall debt burden, including Dollars 2.5bn of unsecured debt and Dollars
4.5bn of secured debt. Continental is also restructuring its aircraft
operating and capital leases while painting and refurbishing the fleet.
To strengthen further the company's finances, Mr Harris is seeking to raise
an additional Dollars 600m in fresh equity. A further Dollars 150m will be
raised from the sale to American Airlines of Continental's Seattle to Tokyo
route, and the company expects to sell its Chelsea aircraft catering
subsidiary for about Dollars 80m.
It is also planning to sell a 51 per cent stake in its Air Micronesia
operations in the Pacific which is expected to raise Dollars 300m.
a big impact on existing shareholders equity. Mr Harris said all present
shareholders would see their holdings greatly reduced. This would include
Scandinavian Airlines System which has a 16.8 per cent stake in the company
and 18.3 per cent of voting rights. But Mr Harris said he expected SAS to
invest additional funds in the US airline.
Apart from Seattle-Tokyo route and the Air Micronesia transaction,
Continental does not intend to make any significant asset sales. Even in the
proposed Air Micronesia deal, Mr Harris said Continental would continue to
operate the service.
The airline already has plans to grow in the Pacific as well as in Europe.
It already provides more services to Mexico than any other US carrier.
While the airline's biggest burden is its heavy debt, one of its biggest
strengths is its low cost base. This is why Mr Harris said he was committed
not to reduce salaries at Continental. 'Our people are the lowest paid in
the industry. Morale is high. That is helping us in bankruptcy', he
explained.
Although Continental, unlike many airlines, does not have a cost problem, it
does have a revenue problem. At the end of the day, the success or failure
of its recovery strategy will depend on its ability to improve the quality
and yields of its revenues.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said he
was considering a sale of Continental Airlines because the ``noise''
at strike-torn Eastern Airlines was hurting the sister carrier's
business.
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Lorenzo said
the sale of part or all of Houston-based Continental was under
discussion partly because of the negative impact from Eastern's
bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' Lorenzo said
in his New York office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (Continental) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in Miami.''
   He made the surprise announcement about Continental late Thursday
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on
Continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter,
said Lorenzo, whose Texas Air is the parent of the two carriers.
Continental showed a net profit of $32.1 million in the quarter,
compared with a loss of $150.9 million a year earlier.
   Continental could benefit from ``distance'' from Eastern, Lorenzo
said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer Donald Trump
bought it from Eastern in early June for $365 million.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of Continental
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at Eastern and Continental's reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, Texas Air stock has
soared from around $9 or $10 a share at the beginning of the year to
over $20 currently. It rose 87{ cents Friday to close at $20.75 on
the American Stock Exchange, after jumping as high as $22.25.
   Possible buyers of Continental or part of it could include
Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in
Texas Air, and Pan Am Corp., which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., may be interested in a combination with Continental.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including SAS or another foreign carrier.
   SAS spokeswoman Barbara Levites and Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon, both in New York, declined comment on the matter Friday. An
Icahn associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
Continental a hot property.
   A group led by California investor Alfred Checchi recently
acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $4 billion, while
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is being ardently pursued by
investor Marvin Davis, British Airways PLC and others.

   Continental Airlines officials made misleading
comments about the troubled carrier's plans to seek bankruptcy
protection in an effort to prop up its stock value, according to a
lawsuit filed Thursday.
   Former chairman Frank Lorenzo and others artificially inflated
the market price of Continental stock by denying in interviews with
the news media that the nation's fifth-largest airline was
considering filing for bankruptcy protection, according to the
lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders.
   Continental disputed the allegations.
   ``As far as this airline is concerned, that suit is utterly
without merit,'' spokesman Art Kent said from Houston. ``In no way
were our shareholders or the public misled by any statements that
were made. At the time those statements were made, we had no intent
to file for protection under Chapter 11.''
   Continental filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on
Monday, saying it was forced into bankruptcy court by soaring fuel
costs and mounting interest payments on its $6.2 billion debt.
   The shareholders lawsuit, a class action filed in U.S. District
Court, was brought on behalf of investors who purchased Continental
stock between Oct. 24 and the airline's bankruptcy filing.
   The shareholders said that during this time period, airline
officials publicly denied their intention to seek bankruptcy
protection even though ``such action was continually under
consideration as a solution to Continental's worsening liquidity
and other financial problems.''
   The lawsuit accuses the airline officials of violating
securities laws and seeks unspecified damages because of losses on
investments.
   According to the lawsuit, Continental stock fell from $3.62{ per
share to $2 per share after the bankruptcy filing.
   In addition to Lorenzo, the lawsuit names Jan Carlzon, chairman
of Scandinavian Airlines System, Continental's largest shareholder;
Continental chairman Carl R. Pohlad; and Hollis Harris, president
and chief executive officer of Continental.

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed for
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today,
blaming the move on a stunning rise in fuel costs and heavy debts
accrued in the free-spending 1980s.
   It was the first bankruptcy-court refugee in the airline
business since the dramatic leap in fuel prices caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis, and underscored the financial beating taken by
all airlines because of a weakening economy, with fewer passengers
flying and booking tickets.
   The move also marked a rapidly deteriorating situation for
Continental, once the nation's biggest airline operator, which only
a few weeks ago rejected the bankruptcy-court option.
   Based in Houston, Continental is best known as the child of
one-time airline entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, who built it into a
major force in the airline industry through aggressive
price-cutting and debt-financed expansion after a previous stint in
bankruptcy court seven years ago.
   Continental officials said they expected to operate normally
through the holiday season and passengers would notice no
difference in service.
   ``Essentially, we're allowed to treat the traveling public,
travel agents, tour operators, just as if the bankruptcy hadn't
occurred ...,'' said Paul P. Welsh, a Continental attorney. ``There
will not be anyone stranded.''
   The airline filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in Wilmington, Del., where it is incorporated.
Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve from debts while it
works out a way to pay the bills and tries to re-emerge from court
protection as a healthy business.
   As part of the bankruptcy filing, Continental said it agreed to
sell its prized Seattle-to-Tokyo route to American Airlines for
$150 million, pending approval of the court.
   Today's filing marks the second bankruptcy-court stint for
Continental. In 1983, amid a bitter labor dispute with the
airline's unions, then-chairman Frank Lorenzo plunged the airline
into bankruptcy court, scapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for workers striking at the time.
   The incident eventually led to changes in the law to limit
companies' right to abrogate union contracts by bankruptcy filing.
   In today's statement, Continental, the nation's fifth-largest
airline, said the latest financial woes were brought on by high jet
fuel costs and a high debt load, which have ``created a temporary
cash shortage for the airline.''
   The airline listed total assets of $4.77 billion and liabilities
of $5.85 billion.
   ``Continental has made these decisions reluctantly,'' Hollis
Harris, chairman, president and chief executive of Continental,
told a news conference in Wilmington. ``We couldn't handle the debt
and the cost of fuel at the same time. Fuel is our highest item of
operating costs.''
   Harris said that since July, Continental was paying $70 milion
per month more in jet fuel because of the recent runup in oil
prices. He said fuel costs made up about a quarter of its operating
costs.
   Continental lost $88.3 million in the third quarter of this
year, compared with a loss of $158 million in 1989. For the first
nine months, losses totaled $97 million, compared with a $522.8
million loss last year.
   Harris said he forsaw no need for layoffs, pay cuts or
reductions in benefits to the airline's 37,000 employees as a
result of the bankruptcy-court move.
   Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co. in
New York, said if Continental's creditors agree to a reorganization
plan early on, ``they still have chance of survival'' because
``they have a good, solid domestic system and they have a low
operating cost structure.''
   Continental, which was known as Texas Air Corp. until this
summer, is the parent of Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989 and has been run by
a government-appointed trustee since April 10.
   Continental had been rumored to be considering filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the past several weeks.
   As recently as late October, the company said its board of
directors, including Lorenzo, unanimously rejected a proposal to
file, saying it would consider possible asset sales, cost controls
or seek new investors.
   Continental sold a 16.8 percent stake to Scandinavian Airline
System in August and Lorenzo stepped down as chairman, although he
remains on the board.

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of
the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in
bankruptcy since late 1990.
SAS has had a co-operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under
which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US
network.
This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written
off.
The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a
further investment in Continental as the co-operation was now 'firmly
established' and would continue.
SAS has three members on the Continental board.
The bid deadline for Continental expired on Monday, with at least three
suitors thought to be still in the running.
Continental confirmed that Lufthansa, the German airline which had
considered making an offer with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier,
was no longer pursuing a deal.
This appeared to leave three contenders: a consortium lead by Mr Charles
Hurwitz's Maxxam group; an offer from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air; and a
proposal from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership.
Shortly after bids closed, Air Canada confirmed it was still interested in
Continental, but declined to give more details. The Maxxam group also said
it had submitted an offer by the deadline.
Although both the Air Canada and Maxxam consortia confirmed that they had
submitted bids for Continental by Monday's deadline, Houston Air was less
forthcoming.
'In the interest of the future of Continental Airlines and integrity of its
bidding process, Houston Air believes it would be inappropriate to make
further comment on the status of its bid for the airline at this time,' it
said.
Continental has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on
November 9.

   Frank Lorenzo parlayed his airline holding
company into a leading force in the industry, but along the way
incurred the wrath of organized labor which vilified him as a union
buster.
   The inability of Lorenzo and the unions to make peace with each
other played an indirect but important role in his announcement
Thursday that he was exiting the airline business after more than
two decades.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, said he is selling most of his
stake in Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. to Scandinavian
Airlines System. The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake
in Houston-based Continental for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President Hollis L. Harris, a
highly respected manager lured to Continental after a discreet
search that started four months ago.
   The negative publicity that came to haunt Lorenzo and his
company was an important element in his decision to get out,
Lorenzo told reporters at a news briefing in New York.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, Lorenzo said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   The departure of Lorenzo marks the end of an era, but it didn't
end the criticism of him by organized labor.
   ``We can all shout `hallelujah!,''' said E.J. Breen, chairman of
the Eastern Airlines pilots strike committee.
   ``Clearly, nobody denies his genius to put deals together. But
as for his ability to operate (airlines), he's a complete
failure,'' Breen said in a telephone interview from Miami, where
Eastern is headquartered. ``The way I'll remember him is as a
tyrant who destroyed lives and walked away with pockets full of
money and not a care in the world for what he has done.''
   Others reacted with a similar mix of satisfaction and
resentment. The International Association of Machinists, which has
led the Eastern strike from the start, said he was largely
responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``Frank Lorenzo demolished Eastern Airlines, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued Continental
Airlines,'' said John Peterpaul, IAM general vice president. ``Our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''
   Lorenzo will get nearly $30 million in severance payments and
sale proceeds. But that is only a fraction of what his airlines
were worth years ago in better times.
   From his plunge into the flying business in the 1960s, the
Harvard MBA helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate fares
to the industry's first hostile takeover. Lorenzo built his holding
company into the largest airline company in the country, owning
both Continental and Eastern.
   In 1966, he and Harvard classmate Robert Carney formed a
financial advisory firm. Two years later, they created Jet Capital
Corp., which bought a controlling interest in Texas International
Airlines in 1972.
   Lorenzo, then 32, was the carrier's youngest president.
   His image as a union buster began when he fought organized labor
at Continental Airlines and won.
   In 1981, Lorenzo merged Texas International with Continental
after a bitter takeover battle. Two years later, he put
Continental, then the nation's eighth-largest carrier, under
bankruptcy protection, scrapped labor contracts and hired strike
replacements at lower pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired New York Air, People Express and
Frontier airlines, which have been merged into Continental.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired Eastern.
The unions waged a bitter strike against the carrier and made
Lorenzo the target of their hatred.
   Lorenzo lost control of Eastern altogether in April when U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland placed the airline in the hands of
trustee Martin Shugrue. Texas Air Corp. then changed its name to
Continental Airlines Holdings.

Pan Am Corp. is among those interested in the possibility of buying Continental 
Airlines from Texas Air Corp., a source close to Pan Am said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said at the company's annual meeting last week 
that all or part of Houston-based Continental was on the block. Then it was 
reported over the weekend that Scandinavian Airline System and an unidentified 
partner are preparing a bid for Continental. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Lorenzo said the fallout from the bankruptcy of Eastern 
Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary, had hurt Continental's business. 
</P>
<P>
Half of SAS is owned jointly by the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, 
with private investors holding the other half. SAS owns just under 10% of 
Continental and has a marketing arrangement with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged Financing 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, parent of Pan American World Airways, has vast overseas operations, 
especially in the transatlantic market, and is known to be hoping to merge with 
an American carrier that has a domestic route system capable of feeding 
passengers to Pan Am's overseas flights. Airline observers maintain that Pan 
Am, which has been losing money, cannot survive without such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
These observers say Continental seems to fit the bill. This summer, Pan Am lost 
out in the bidding war for NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, and recently 
was reported to be interested in bidding for UAL Inc., which owns United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Pan Am could be considered a potential buyer, a possible suitor, for 
Continental," the source said. "Pan Am has proved that it can pull the 
financing together to swing the deal," the source said. Pan Am was understood 
to have arranged at least $3 billion worth of financing to support its bid for 
NWA. 
</P>
<P>
At Pan Am headquarters in New York, spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler declined to 
discuss any role that Pan Am might have in a purchase of Continental. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was also learned that Drexel Burnham Lambert, Continental's 
investment banker, had approached Pan Am about three weeks ago to see if would 
have any interest in buying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases Most Planes 
</P>
<P>
For the Northwest purchase, Pan Am had lined up financing with Prudential 
Bache, the Airlie Group investment partnership, the Lazard Freres investment 
firm and a consortium of five major banks. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analysts contend, however, that even though Pan Am might have obtained 
enough financing for an acquisition of NWA or UAL, it would be much more 
difficult to do so for an attempt to buy Continental. The analysts reason that 
Continental owns a far smaller proportion of its airliners and other assets 
than the other two carriers do, so Pan Am would need considerably more cash to 
finance the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Avmark Inc., an aviation marketing and management service in 
Arlington, Va., the most recent figures show that Continental owns only about 
33% of its 339 planes and leases the remainder. Northwest, on the other hand 
owns all but 12% of its 306 planes. United owns all but 14% of its 425 planes. 
</P>
<P>
"When so many planes are leased, the assets against which you can borrow are 
much smaller," said Paul Turk, an Avmark official. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts also maintain that Texas Air's asking price for Continental will 
be too high for Pan Am. "Lorenzo does not sell things cheaply," said one 
analyst who insisted on anonymity.

   STOCKHOLM -- Scandinavian Airlines System said its pretax
loss widened sharply last year due to hefty one-time charges,
in particular, a major loss on the sale of its 40% stake in
the Inter-Continental Hotels Group.
   Under a preliminary accord reached Thursday, Japan's
Saison group agreed to reacquire the 40% Inter-Continental
stake it sold SAS for $500 million three years ago. Saison
holds the remaining 60% of the Inter-Continental chain, which
it purchased for $2.3 billion in 1988.

   As payment for its stake, SAS is to receive three of the
Inter-Continental chain's hotels -- London's Portman Hotel,
and the Inter-Continental Hotels in Dusseldorf, Germany, and
Cologne, Germany. All three hotels are profitable and have
positive cash flow, SAS said.
   The companies expect to close the transaction in two
months, after completion of due diligence procedures. SAS
estimated that it will show a loss of as much as two billion
Swedish kronor ($330.9 million) from the brief
Inter-Continental foray.
   Despite the record 1991 loss, Chief Executive Officer Jan
Carlzon predicted SAS will return to the black this year. A
tough cost-cutting program narrowed the airline's operating
loss during last year's second half compared with the first
six months, Mr. Carlzon said. "And after shedding several
loss-making investments such as Inter-Continental, we think
we'll make a profit even though there aren't yet any signs of
an end to the airline industry's deep slump," the SAS chief
added.
   The SAS group's pretax loss widened to 1.22 billion kronor
last year from a pretax loss of 763 million kronor the
previous year. The SAS group includes the 50% state-owned
flag carrier of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, plus non-airline
operations such as hotels, travel and catering services. The
group's second-half loss before tax narrowed to 178 million
kronor, from a pretax loss of 1.1 billion kronor in the
year-earlier period and a loss of 1.04 billion kronor during
last year's first six months.
   Revenue last year climbed 1.2% to 32.3 billion kronor from
31.88 billion kronor a year earlier, SAS said.
   Full-year operating profit surged to 1.38 billion kronor
from 649 million kronor the previous year. But financial
costs more than doubled because of higher interest payments
and negative effects of currency fluctuations.
   In addition, SAS's incurred a loss of 819 million kronor
from holdings in affiliates. That amount reflected 1991
losses by an aircraft leasing affiliate and SAS's prorata
share of last year's red ink at InterContinental Hotels.
   Nonrecurring charges of 1.2 billion kronor also included
in last year's accounts covered write-downs of the value of
SAS's Inter-Continental Hotel holding, as well as the
remaining $70 million book value of SAS's stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., parent of Continental
Airlines. Continental, an important strategic partner of SAS,
has operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection since
December 1990.

   Frank Lorenzo is no longer boss at Continental
Airlines, but the carrier he shaped is following a road he traveled
in the early 1980s when Continental first sought refuge under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   On Monday, Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed for
protection for a second time, blaming the move on the recent runup
in fuel costs and heavy debts accrued in the 1980s.
   Lorenzo, the 50-year-old entrepreneur who came to symbolize a
tumultuous decade of airline deregulation, announced in August he
was selling off most of his stake in Continental to Scandinavian
Airlines System.
   He also resigned as chairman and chief executive at Continental,
replaced by Hollis Harris, a respected manager lured from rival
Delta Air Lines Inc.
   Just two weeks ago, in his first public remarks since departing
Continental, Lorenzo warned that the troubles in the airline
industry could leave just three or four major airlines within three
years.
   ``And if you don't like air fares today ... just hold on to your
hats - you may not have seen anything yet in terms of air fare
price increases,'' he said.
   The predecessor to Continental Holdings was Texas Air Corp.,
which Lorenzo built into the nation's largest airline operator,
parenting Continental and Eastern Airlines. The growth of Texas Air
began in 1966 when Lorenzo and Harvard University classmate Robert
Carney formed a financial advisory firm.
   Even before that, in 1963, Lorenzo's first professional job was
in the industry, when he was hired by Trans World Airlines as a
financial analyst. Within two years, he was manager of the
financial analysis department at Eastern.
   In 1968, the Lorenzo-Carney duo created Jet Capital Corp., which
bought a controlling interest in Texas International Airlines in
1972. Lorenzo, then 32, a Harvard MBA and son of Spanish immigrants
from Queens, N.Y., was the carrier's youngest president.
   In 1981, Lorenzo merged Texas International with Continental
after a bitter takeover battle. His image as a union buster began
when he fought organized labor at Continental and won.
   The image grew in 1983 when he put Continental, then the
nation's eighth-largest airline, under bankruptcy protection,
scrapped labor contracts and hired strike replacements at lower
pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired New York Air, People Express and
Frontier airlines, which were merged into Continental.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired Eastern in
1986, where his relationship with unions was acrimonious and a
strike against the airline made him the target of union members'
hatred.
   Using billions of dollars in borrowed money and cheap fares,
Continental and Eastern, once high-cost airlines, helped Texas Air
become the nation's largest airline operator, capturing about 20
percent of the domestic market.
   But with bitter resistance from the unions, particularly at
Eastern, both airlines came under extreme financial pressure and
there were doubts about Eastern's ability to survive.
   After the strike hamstrung Eastern in 1989, Eastern sought
bankruptcy court protection and is still operating under the
supervision of a court trustee who replaced Lorenzo in April.
   It was then that Continental began a quiet hunt for a new
leader, a search that resulted in the hiring of Harris.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken,'' Lorenzo said in announcing his departure.

Talk about good luck. A year ago, people at United Airlines were getting ready 
to slash their wrists because the $6.8-billion leveraged buyout of the company 
had fallen apart. Today, they ought to be sending thank-you notes to the 
Japanese bankers whose last-minute reluctance to lend blew the deal out of the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
Because, you see, if the $300-a-share LBO had gone through, United would now be 
choking on a combination of high interest payments and Saddam Hussein-inspired 
fuel bills, the way that debt-ridden airlines such as Continental, Pan Am, 
USAir, Eastern, Northwest, TWA, Midway, Hawaiian Airlines and America West are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, United, like the country's two other major, relatively debt-free 
airlines -- American and Delta -- can stand the strain of higher fuel bills 
because its balance sheet is relatively debt-free. In fact, United has just 
ordered new airplanes and is in a dogfight with American for the right to buy 
choice European routes from debt-ridden Pan Am, which is once again selling 
prime assets in an attempt to keep itself afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that United was lucky rather than smart is beside the point. If you 
compare the United that is to the United that would have been, you begin to see 
why, from the dawn of airline companies until junk bonds came briefly to rule 
the earth, loan officers were taught to be very careful about lending money to 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, when you think about it, is obvious. Airlines can be very 
lucrative, but they're also very risky. There are expensive planes to buy, 
unpredictable fuel costs to meet, fickle customers to lure. As Chairman Herbert 
Kelleher of Southwest Airlines said in an issue of Forbes magazine earlier this 
year, "You (can) go from spilling cash to bleeding red ink like the Mississippi 
River going through the Delta." 
</P>
<P>
Risks such as those are known as "operating leverage." Any time a company with 
operating leverage borrows a lot of money, it's piling financial leverage onto 
operating leverage. This doesn't merely add risk to risk; it multiplies them. 
It's the financial equivalent of mixing drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
But because shrewd and lucky financial operators such as Frank Lorenzo of Texas 
Air Corp. (now Continental Airlines Holdings) seemed to be the wave of the 
future, the old rule about not combining operating risk with financial risk 
went out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Any airline that wasn't loaded with debt was accused of not having done the 
right thing by its shareholders. Analysts snickered at Delta for not being 
daring enough. Marvin Davis, the California billionaire, raided United. Donald 
J. Trump, then a real estate mogul, now a deadbeat, was threatening to raid 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Who's laughing now? Northwest Airlines, which went private in a leveraged 
buyout that Chairman Alfred A. Checchi boasts is two years ahead of schedule in 
repaying its debt, is talking about "major layoffs." Hawaiian, another LBO, is 
on the brink of financial failure. TWA, hocked to the eyeballs by Carl C. Icahn 
to buy out its shareholders and make huge payments to him, is choking. Braniff 
has gone broke for the second time. USAir, which borrowed heavily to buy other 
companies, is being squeezed, as are Midway and America West. 
</P>
<P>
"We have proven that airlines are not candidates for LBOs," Pan Am Chairman 
Thomas G. Plaskett told a group of travel agents earlier this month. "They 
generate enough operating and financial leverage on their own, let alone adding 
to the leverage to provide payouts to shareholders." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's our old friend Continental Airlines Holdings, formerly Texas Air. 
The news leaked last week that Continental had considered going Chapter 11 but 
decided not to do so. The disclosure that the company had thought of going 
Chapter 11 may well end up forcing it into Chapter 11 because suppliers will 
probably cut back on credit and travel agents may stop booking Continental 
flights. They remember getting burned in 1983, when Texas Air put Continental 
Airlines into bankruptcy, and again in 1989, when it was Eastern's turn to go 
belly up. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, which had $2.6 billion in debt and long-term leases on its books 
as of June 30 -- not counting Eastern's multibillion-dollar debt -- said it is 
thinking of selling its foreign routes to help buy its way out of trouble. The 
problem is that Continental has pledged its foreign routes to the U.S. Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions. The agency 
got Continental to pledge those assets to guarantee payment of the shortfall in 
Eastern's pension plan, a gap that the agency puts at $565 million. Continental 
is still on the hook for Eastern's pension plan, even though a bankruptcy judge 
took control of Eastern away from Continental six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's press relations people, as usual, wouldn't take my call. I didn't 
even bother trying to find Lorenzo, whom I've called for more than 10 years but 
who has never called me back. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chapter 11 prospect makes Lorenzo's departure from Continental this 
August look more than a little suspicious. Lorenzo, you recall, bailed out with 
$27 million, thanks to a deal he cut with Scandinavian Airline Systems to sell 
his Continental stock and stock options for about triple the market price. 
That's continuing the pattern in which Lorenzo cut special deals with the 
company that put millions of dollars in his pocket at the expense of other 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Frank. He said in August that he was leaving Continental to let SAS run it 
unhindered. Yeah, right. At least when the Titanic sank, the captain had enough 
class to go down with the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Department: Last week, in my Boston Celtics column, I wrote that master 
limited partnerships will lose their tax breaks after 1997. I should have said 
"most MLPs," because the post-1997 rule doesn't apply to real estate and 
natural resource MLPs.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: SAS rules out any role in a
Continental bid

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of
the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in
bankruptcy since late 1990.
SAS has had a co-operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under
which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US
network.
This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written
off.
The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a
further investment in Continental as the co-operation was now 'firmly
established' and would continue.
SAS has three members on the Continental board.
AIR Canada has failed to agree terms for a merger with rival Canadian
Airlines International, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by Air Canada and PWA, parent of
Canadian, on October 8 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal
is 'unachievable', Air Canada said.
Under the merger plan, Air Canada and Canadian would have continued as
separate entities while a new holding company would have been formed with
shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the
holding company.

<HEAD>Scandinavian Airline Makes Deal With U.S. Carrier</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New York news conference scheduled to begin 8 a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airlines System and Texas Air Corp. scheduled a
joint Tuesday morning news conference in New York to announce what
SAS said was a major cooperation deal with a U.S. airline.
   The news conference comes amid unconfirmed reports in the United
States and Europe that SAS might acquire a stake in Texas Air, or
that the two companies would engage in a cooperative business
effort.
   SAS and Texas Air scheduled an 8 a.m. EDT news conference at New
York's Plaza Hotel to announce the deal. Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo and SAS President Jan Carlzon also scheduled a later news
conference at the Plaza.
   SAS officials in Stockholm, Sweden said Monday the airline had
reached a cooperation deal with a major U.S. carrier, but declined
to give details or identify the carrier.
   The Washington Post reported in its Tuesday editions that SAS
was negotiating to buy a stake in Houston-based Texas Air, the
owner of Eastern and Continental airlines. Citing unidentified
industry sources, the newspaper said Carlzon traveled to Texas in
recent weeks to negotiate with the airline holding company.
   Tuesday's New York Times indicated SAS and Texas Air were
expected to announce an agreement to coordinate their schedules to
offer customers the shortest times between major destinations, in
an attempt to attract more business travelers.
   Other reports speculated SAS would buy some of Eastern's
Atlantic or domestic U.S. routes, including landing rights in
Miami, to which SAS long has sought access.
   SAS information director Knut Lovstuhagen refused to confirm
reports on Monday, but said the deal was ``extensive.''
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, which is 50 percent owned by the
governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop a
``global axis'' strategy.
   But negotiations on several other deals fell through last year,
including talks with the Belgian national carrier SABENA, with
British Caledonian and with Aerolinas Argentinas.
   Texas Air is the largest U.S. airline company, while SAS is the
eighth-largest European airline.

<TEXT>
   Now that Frank Lorenzo is leaving Continental
Airlines, the question remains whether the carrier can rise above
the problems it accumulated on its way to the top.
   Lorenzo's departure may have stemmed the flow of harsh criticism
from organized labor, but the carrier still faces other obstacles.
   Heavy debts and a bitter strike at sister carrier Eastern
Airlines have hurt business, and Continental still suffers from an
image problem. But despite those hurdles, several analysts said
Friday there is room for optimism.
   ``It is a fairly low-cost provider. With a different kind of
management, it could be a very powerful airline,'' said industry
analyst Andrew Geller of PNC Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.
   ``I think it definitely has a better future now, or a heightened
chance of a better future with this happening,'' Geller said.
``Whether I think it's a survivor, I don't know yet.''
   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., announced Thursday that Lorenzo was selling most of his
stake in the company to Scandinavian Airlines System and resigning
as chairman and chief executive.
   Lorenzo will be replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President
Hollis L. Harris.
   The Houston-based company once commanded 20 percent of the
domestic airline market through its ownership of Continental and
its sister carrier, Miami-based Eastern.
   Robert J. Joedicke, of Lehman Brothers in New York, said the
carrier has several advantages and disadvantages as it moves into
the post-Lorenzo era.
   ``Its labor costs are lower than the industry average. Whoever
takes it over is blessed with a low-cost airline,'' he said. ``They
can be quite competitive among the major carriers.''
   The company's debt, however, ``sort of counterbalances that,''
Joedicke said. Its success, he said, depends on whether management
can realign the structure of its debt, which totaled some $4.8
billion as of March 31.
   Joedicke also said he believes Harris will make strides in
improving service, which should help attract additional business
travelers.
   ``They kind of had a reputation of bad service that they were
slowly getting rid of, this may hasten that,'' said Thomas Canning
of Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.
   Canning said Harris is well respected in the airline industry
and should be instrumental in polishing Continental's tarnished
image.
   But Continental also faces problems common throughout the
airline industry, including high fuel costs, sagging traffic growth
and increased competition, he said.
   Continental, he said, needs to attract a loyal following and
obtain a larger share of the flying public. He said that except for
Lorenzo's surprise departure, he doubted there would be any major
changes immediately.

   Scandinavian Airlines System has held informal talks with Texas Air Corp. about buying all or part of its Continental Airlines unit, SAS President Jan Carlzon said. 

   If Continental Airlines "is up for sale," he said, "we will be there to talk and consider the possibilities." 

   Stockholm-based SAS, 50%-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, holds a 9.9% stake in Texas Air as part of a marketing arrangement with Continental and Texas Air announced last fall. 

   Last month, individuals familiar with the situation said SAS and an unidentified partner were in advanced talks with Texas Air about the possible sale of Continental Airlines. 

   Mr. Carlzon declined to say whether the informal talks have involved a U.S. partner. 
U.S. rules prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25% stake in a U.S. airline, and so any transaction would have to be structured so that SAS has a minority holding.

   Texas Air Corp. says it is considering selling a
minority or controlling stake in its Continental Airlines subsidiary
and has talked to parties interested in the airline.
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline company, also said
Thursday it has hired an investment adviser to explore a possible
transaction.
   The announcement came a week after a Boston investment firm
disclosed that it holds 12 percent of Texas Air, which also owns
strike-plagued Eastern Airlines. Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., a Boston
portfolio management company, has said its 12 percent stake was held
for investment because it believed Texas Air would show a profit in
1990.
   Scandinavian Airlines System owns around 10 percent of Texas Air.
   Late Thursday, Texas Air released a statement saying its
chairman, Frank Lorenzo, revealed that the company was considering a
possible sale of an interest in Continental during a management
conference.
   Lorenzo said in a statement there were arguments in favor of
selling Continental, such as giving the airline access to stronger
financial resources.
   However, he said, ``there are also a number of compelling reasons
why a sale of the company may not be advisable.''
   Continental is emerging from a period of consolidations with
other airlines as a stronger company and shows potential for
improved financial results, Lorenzo said.
   Texas Air said it retained the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. as an adviser on any transaction. Continental spokesman
Ned Walker declined to comment further on the statement.
   Miami-based Eastern is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. The carrier filed for protection from its creditors
on March 9, five days after its machinists, pilots and flight
attendants went on strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a
smaller airline using non-union workers.
   In 1983, Lorenzo followed a similar path with Continental.
   Airline industry analysts expressed surprise at Lorenzo's
announcement.
   ``I expected Continental would be the last thing he would dispose
of,'' said Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may just be trying to find
out what Continental is worth, he suggested.
   ``He might just be testing the waters,'' Marckesano said.
   Many observers had expected Lorenzo to fold the remnants of
Eastern into Continental, he noted.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   He speculated that Lorenzo might be considering bringing in a
high-profile purchaser to change Continental's image as a low-fare
carrier that does not appeal to business travelers.
   ``I think the biggest problem is the image of Continental with
the business travelers,'' Hersh said.

   A new $50 million agreement between Scandinavian
Airlines System and Texas Air Corp. is designed to strengthen the
competitive positions of both companies, officials say.
   Separately, a report published today said Texas Air is holding
discussions to sell its East Coast air shuttle to developer Donald
Trump. According to unidentified sources quoted by The Wall Street
Journal, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle is in the $200
million range.
   As evidence the shuttle is up for sale, Journal sources noted
that planes and lounge areas have been refurbished, and attendants
are getting new uniforms. The service is run by Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air declined comment on the Journal report, said Mark
Johnson, a spokesman for the airline company. Representatives of
Trump weren't immediately available for comment.
   Some say Trump might use the shuttle, which operates between
Washington, New York and Boston, to help draw people to his hotel
and casino properties in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Trump already operates a helicopter service between New York and
Atlantic City.
   Under Texas Air's agreement with SAS, the Scandinavian airline
will lease airport gates in the New York area and have the right to
buy up to 10 percent of Texas Air's stock on the open market.
   The accord, signed Tuesday, also includes provisions for
coordinating marketing, reservations and scheduling, and the
companies will establish a joint training program for airline
workers.
   Texas Air, the largest U.S. airline company, owns Continental
Airlines and Eastern Airlines, which have been hurt by financial
losses, labor problems and complaints about service.
   SAS, renowned for service but weak in scheduling connections to
the United States, has been seeking ways of positioning itself to
exploit the era of European deregulation that will begin in 1992.
   ``Our aim is to maximize efficiency and provide the best
professional service to business travelers anywhere in the world,''
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo told reporters at a New York press
briefing.
   Under the agreement, SAS will pay Continental $15 million to
lease three gates at Newark International Airport in New Jersey,
beginning next spring. SAS will pay Eastern $10 million for a
similar lease arrangement at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport in 1991.
   SAS also will pay Texas Air $25 million.
   SAS will have the right to buy up to 10 percent of Texas Air's
stock on the open market, and SAS officials said they intended to
make the purchases within six months.
   Texas Air stock was the most actively traded issue Tuesday on
the American Stock Exchange, declining 12{ cents to $14.25. The
company has 39.9 million shares outstanding.
   Jan Carlzon, SAS president and chief executive officer, will
become a member of Texas Air's board of directors.
   The marriage of a financially pressed U.S. airline company and a
service-oriented European carrier makes sense for both, analysts
said.
   SAS will get the access to U.S. routes that it is seeking while
Texas Air will get cash that it needs, noted Anthony Hatch, an
analyst for Argus Research Corp.
   The agreement is not unprecedented, but it combines elements of
existing arrangements in a new way. United Airlines, the biggest
U.S. carrier, signed an agreement with British Airways late last
year setting up a worldwide marketing partnership.
   But unlike the accord between SAS and Texas Air, the
United-British Airways combination doesn't include an equity stake.
SAS' equity stake in Texas Air ``helps them cement the alliance,''
Hatch said.
   As European deregulation approaches, similar accords between
major airlines in the United States and Europe are likely to crop
up, said Andrew Geller, an airline analyst for Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia.
   In another case, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., an Australian
conglomerate owned 50-50 by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and
transportation company TNT Ltd., has a 20 percent stake in America
West Airlines, based in Tempe, Ariz. The two do not have a
cooperative agreement.
   Officials of SAS and Texas Air said they began discussions for
such an alliance about nine months ago, at Lorenzo's initiative.
SAS has similar arrangements with Thai International Airways of
Thailand, and recently purchased a stake in Argentina's national
carrier.
   Continental currently has services from Newark International
Airport to London and Paris, and from Miami to London. SAS, heavily
used by business travelers, flies between Scandinavia and four U.S.
cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, 50 percent owned by the
governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop
what its management calls a ``global axis'' strategy to provide
travelers with the most convenient connections through a network of
cooperation pacts with other carriers.

<HEAD>SAS: Not Immediately Interested in Buying Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airline Systems said
Wednesday it has no immediate interest in buying all or part of the
Texas Air Corp.'s subsidiary Continental Airlines.
   SAS Managing Director Jan Carlzon released the statement as an
answer to ``recent speculation around SAS and its cooperation
partner Continental Airlines.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that SAS was involved
in advanced talks with Texas Air, which had said it may consider
selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental.
   The governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway own half of SAS,
and the other half is in private or corporate hands.
   ``The cooperation between SAS and Cointinental is already a great
success and has given SAS an excellent vantage point to service the
American market,'' Carlzon said.
   ``If Texas Air decided to sell Continental, SAS of course would
guard its interests,'' he said, adding that SAS was ``so pleased
with the current cooperation that the issue of buying Continental
for the time being is not of immediate interest.''
   SAS, which has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air, would not be
able to buy Continental outright since foreign companies are barred
from having more than a 25 percent share in a U.S. carrier.
   SAS and Continental began work in June 1988 on a joint marketing
agreement.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: SAS stays in red with SKr1.2bn
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of
SKr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) for 1991, the second straight year it has suffered a
deficit following its loss of SKr763m in 1990.
The loss reflected extraordinary costs associated with a restructuring
programme as well as a write-off of its involvement in the Inter-Continental
hotel chain. SAS made a small operating loss of SKr9m before extraordinary
costs against a profit of SKr38m in 1990.
But Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS president, expressed confidence that SAS could
return to profitability this year if it succeeds with its cost-cutting
programme, which includes eliminating 3,500 jobs by this summer.
The carrier confirmed it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell back
its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental to the hotel chain's controlling
shareholder, Saison Holding, part of the Japanese retail and leisure group.
Mr Carlzon said the airline has lost between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn from its
unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel operations after it purchased the
stake in Inter-Continental from Saison in 1989 for Dollars 500m.
The hotel venture was part of Mr Carlzon's strategy during the 1980s to
transform SAS into a complete travel company. But the SAS president decided
last year to concentrate on airline operations as passenger traffic dropped
in response to the Gulf War and the recession.
However, SAS will acquire principal ownership of three European hotels from
Inter-Continental, including the Portman in London, the Dusseldorf
Inter-Continental and Cologne Inter-Continental, which will be added to
SAS's own hotel chain.
The write-off of its shares in Inter-Continental as well as the bankrupt US
carrier Continental Airlines amounted to SKr1.2bn, which helped increase
one-time restructuring and extraordinary expenses for SAS to SKr1.9bn.

<BYLINE>Lorenzo Says He's Not Quitting Business</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo insists
that he plans to remain in the airline business, countering
speculation that he might quit.
   A defiant Lorenzo also said Wednesday that Texas Air's Eastern
Airlines subsidiary will start turning a profit next year, despite
the strikebound carrier's enormous debts and bankruptcy proceeding.
   While about 100 Eastern strikers chanted anti-Lorenzo slogans
outside the long-delayed Texas Air annual meeting, the chairman of
the nation's biggest airline company told shareholders he has no
plans to quit the business, won't sell Eastern and likely will have
Texas Air assume some of Eastern's financial obligations.
   ``I have no intentions of leaving the airline business,'' Lorenzo
said at a news conference after the meeting. ``I plan to be around
for plenty of years to come, God willing.''
   Speculation that Lorenzo might quit was fueled by his surprise
announcement Aug. 24 that he was considering selling all or part of
Houston-based Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other main
subsidiary. He had no comment on a statement Wednesday by Jan
Carlzon, managing director of Scandinavian Airlines System, that SAS
has no ``immediate interest'' in buying part of Continental.
   SAS, which owns a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air, has been in
talks with Texas Air officials about possibly buying part of
Continental. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed to own up
to 25 percent of an American carrier.
   Security was tight at the hotel where the shareholders meeting
took place, largely because of Lorenzo's unpopularity among Eastern
strikers. Stockholders had to pass through metal detectors,
television cameras were banned from the meeting room and Houston
uniformed and plainclothes police as well as private security guards
were present.
   Lorenzo's remarks about Miami-based Eastern came as the airline
is mired in the seventh month of a strike that has become a national
symbol of labor resistance and has left thousands of pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists union members walking picket lines
demanding Lorenzo's resignation.
   Eastern has been replacing the strikers with picket-line crossers
and non-union hires and is flying a limited operation, but it is
doing business under the protection of federal bankruptcy court _
where it sought protection from creditors five days after the strike
began March 4.
   If Continental were sold, some observers believe Lorenzo might
liquidate Eastern and quit the business.
   But the airline chief told about 300 shareholders at the meeting
that Eastern ``is projecting profitable operations beginning next
year.'' The stockholders responded with applause.
   Eastern has made an ``astonishing rebound from the devastation
caused by the strike of its three unions, and is recovering much
faster than expected,'' Lorenzo said during the hourlong meeting.
   He said Eastern's proposed reorganization plan, submitted to
bankruptcy court July 21, likely will receive final court approval
by year end or early next year, clearing the way for the airline to
emerge from bankruptcy at about two-thirds its pre-strike size.
   ``Texas Air is standing behind Eastern Airlines, and the
possibility is excellent that Texas Air will assist Eastern,'' said
Lorenzo, who aggressively built the parent company from a small
intrastate carrier into an airline empire.
   The annual meeting coincided with a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York at which a judge approved a plan for payment of
$98.3 million Eastern owes to employee pension plans. Texas Air is
lending Eastern $45 million toward the payment, Eastern is paying
$27 million with the proceeds of asset sales, and the rest has been
deferred until July 1990.
   Eastern's proposed reorganization calls for repaying all
creditors in full, including refunding the price of tickets that
weren't used because of the walkout.
   The strikers have been pushing for a sale of Eastern in its
entirety and have allied themselves in that effort with Joseph
Ritchie, a Chicago businessman. Eastern, meanwhile, has been selling
aircraft, routes and airport gates to raise money toward paying off
its $2.3 billion debt.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at
nearly all the nation's major carriers, has spent $69.5 million _
about 57 percent of its contingency fund _ on the battle with
Eastern. Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits
to Eastern pilots averaging about $2,400 a month per pilot, said
John Mazor, an ALPA spokesman in Washington.
   But the number of pilots paying those assessments to their
colleagues at Eastern has decreased as the strike has worn on, Mazor
said in a telephone interview.
   ``That's typical for any (strike) assessment, for any labor
union,'' he said. ``It goes through a predictable cycle.''
   ALPA members are being balloted on whether to continue strike
benefits to their Eastern colleagues, he said.

   The bankruptcy court filing by Continental
Airlines leaves an empire built by ousted chairman Frank Lorenzo in
disarray, but the carrier says it will continue flying while it
tries to reorganize.
   The nation's fifth-largest airline blamed $2.2 billion in debt
and increased jet fuel costs due to the Persian Gulf crisis for
Monday's decision to seek protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Continental said the move did not affect any of about 1,400
flights Monday. The airline serves 88 U.S. cities and 55
international destinations with more than 300 planes. Its main hubs
are in Newark, N.J., Houston and Denver, and the airline is
building up a fourth hub in Cleveland.
   Management sought to reassure the airline's passengers and
37,000 employees the carrier planned to emerge from bankruptcy
court as an operating entity. The airline would fly its normal
schedule and honor contracts with travel agents and other airlines.
   ``We are confident that there will be no need for layoffs, pay
cuts or reductions in benefits,'' said Hollis Harris, chairman of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the airline's parent, which
also filed for Chapter 11.
   The move, though, leaves in tatters an empire crafted by Lorenzo
from a hodgepodge of carriers including Eastern Airlines, People
Express and Frontier and its huge debt is a legacy of its growth
during the 1980s.
   Subsidiary Eastern is struggling as it seeks to reorganize after
filing for bankruptcy protection in 1989, Lorenzo was ousted as
chairman earlier this year and his Texas Air Corp. was renamed.
   The trip to bankruptcy court was the second in seven years by
Continental, which filed in 1983 amid a bitter labor dispute with
the airline's union. Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve
from debts while it figures out how to pay bills and tries to
reorganize as a healthy business.
   ``This is not a bankruptcy as was Continental's in 1983 or
Eastern's last year,'' Continental's general counsel, Charles T.
Goolsbee, said. ``Remember, those airlines shut down. ... We are
doing none of that. This is absolutely a business-as-usual
program.''
   Some analysts said Continental may have a relatively smooth ride
through bankruptcy court, but recent shakeouts in the industry and
the uncertainty of the Middle East situation remain troubling.
   ``It's still a strong airline,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst
with Dillon Read &amp; Co., a Wall Street investment firm. ``They've
got good hubs and fairly cheap operating costs. They want to hold
onto most of these assets. In the long term, that could be good.''
   Continental said it had agreed to sell its Seattle-Tacoma to
Tokyo route to American Airlines for $150 million, pending
bankruptcy court approval. The route sale is to be concluded at the
end of 1991, but $140 million of the sale price is expected to be
advanced to Continental before the deal closes.
   As part of the sale, Continental withdrew its other
international routes from the market. Last month, Continental put
those up for sale instead of seeking bankruptcy protection.
   Continental has about $2.2 billion in outstanding debt, about
$1.7 billion of which is secured. It also has nearly $4 billion in
aircraft operating losses.
   Harris said the airline is spending an extra $70 million a month
on jet fuel because of a sharp rise since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August. Prices more than doubled from about 57 cents in July to
$1.28 in mid-October before falling back in recent weeks.
   Continental now is paying $1.07 per gallon. In addition, the
airline has increased passenger fares 15 percent in recent months,
but spokesman Ned Walker said the hikes ``come nowhere near to
recovering our fuel costs.''
   Continental lost $88.3 million in the third quarter of this
year, compared to a loss of $158 million in 1989. For the first
nine months, losses totaled $97 million, compared with $523 million
in the same period a year ago.
   Rising jet fuel costs have affected other airlines, but none had
filed for Chapter 11 before Continental.
   Earlier this fall, Pan Am Corp. announced it would sell five
prized London routes to UAL Corp., the parent of United, in a $400
million deal. In addition, airlines have laid of thousands of
workers and some plan to cut capacities.

<HL> Texas Air Clears 10% SAS Stake, Discusses Sale of Shuttle to Trump </HL>

<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., in major restructuring moves, agreed to let Scandinavian Airlines System acquire a 10% equity stake and is holding talks to sell its East Coast air shuttle to developer Donald Trump. 

   The investment by SAS and the possible sale of the shuttle have been rumored for weeks. 
But the global scope of Texas Air's joint operating arrangement with SAS, as well as the interest of Mr. Trump in the shuttle, had been closely guarded secrets. 

   The transaction with SAS establishes a wide-ranging combination of services between the two airlines, including the leasing of gates and landing rights to SAS at Newark, N.J., airport from Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit. 

   In addition to the 10% equity stake -- which SAS will acquire in open-market purchases -- provisions of the agreement include ground service and joint-training arrangements, the payment of as much as $50 million in fees to Texas Air and its operating units and new arrangements permitting each airline to feed passengers into the route system of the other. 

   "We should work as vacuum cleaners to get people into the system" said Jan Carlzon, the expansion-minded chairman of SAS, a consortium of airlines partly owned by the governments of Norway, Denmark and Sweden. 

   The airlines called the agreement "the airline industry's first comprehensive global alliance among major international carriers." 
Frank Lorenzo, who built Houston-based Texas Air into the nation's largest airline company but who has begun shrinking it of late, added in an interview: "From where we stand, this is a sensible marriage. 
It gives tremendous strength and traffic support to SAS, and the same to Continental." 

   Texas Air itself refused to comment on the negotiations to sell the East Coast shuttle to Mr. Trump, but sources close to Mr. Trump confirmed the talks were under way. 
Sources say the price under discussion is in the neighborhood of $200 million. 

   Mr. Lorenzo declined to comment on any talks with Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump couldn't be reached and his attorney in New York declined to comment. 

   Texas Air's lucrative, three-city shuttle service, which is operated by Eastern Airlines, has been considered for purchase by, among others, Carl Icahn, the New York investor who control Trans World Airlines. 
The extent of Mr. Icahn's interest couldn't be established. 

   Texas Air's willingness to sell the operation has been clear for months. 
In a transaction that eventually was scuttled under legal pressure from hard-nosed unions at Eastern Airlines, Texas Air proposed to transfer ownership of the operation from Eastern to a newly created unit of Texas Air for $225 million. 
At the time, Texas Air proposed to sell a 20% interest in the operation to private investors -- and Mr. Trump is among those who expressed an interest. 

   As further evidence to some inside the company that Texas Air is preparing the shuttle to be sold, shuttle planes have been refurbished, airport lounges have been renovated and flight attendants have been measured and outfitted for new uniforms that say simply, "Shuttle." 

   Real estate executives in New York say they have long suspected Mr. Trump of wanting to own an airline -- an asset that would be compatible with his extensive holdings in hotels and casinos. 
And the Eastern shuttle has a high visibility in New York -- exactly the sort of asset that Mr. Trump covets. 

   A source close to the talks said Mr. Trump, in the short term, would run the airline as is, and put in enough capital to upgrade service. 
"He thinks that with his name he can clean it up and get it to run on time," the source said. 

   However, another source familiar with Mr. Trump said that "his thought pattern all ties in with Atlantic City. 
The city is a fabulous play but the transportation into it is terrible. 
The biggest population centers for getting to Atlantic City," he added, are Philadelphia, Washington, New York and Boston. 
The latter three are served by the Eastern shuttle. 

   "They have a fabulous airport right there in Atlantic City," the source added, "but as of now they hardly use it." 

   Mr. Trump currently operates a regularly scheduled helicopter service (with four round trips daily) between New York and Atlantic City, mainly for gamblers and prize-fight fans. 
The helicopter service, which has a toll-free reservations number, is known as "Trump Air." 

   Sources said they expect the shuttle negotiations, which have been occurring since last month, to conclude in the next few weeks. 
However, a source close to the talks said the outcome of negotiations between two such "hard-nosed" figures as Mr. Trump and Mr. Lorenzo couldn't be guaranteed. 
"Can you imagine them negotiating with each other?" the source said. 

   However, Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Carlzon of SAS are an unlikely duo -- with the European airline chieftain making his reputation on high-quality service, harmonious relations with labor unions and strong earnings. 
Mr. Lorenzo, by contrast, has focused on cost-cutting to a degree that has led to phases of poor customer service, strife with unions and severe losses at both Continental and Eastern. 

   But the stark difference is precisely what make the combination so compelling. 
For instance, Mr. Lorenzo said, SAS's renowned Quality Training Institute will train all Continental and Eastern employees. 
And Mr. Carlzon said he would call on Texas Air's expertise with cost-cutting and competition as SAS prepares to face the deregulation of the European airline industry in three years. 

   "We must increase cost efficiency, we must have an information distribution system to reach the market, we must develop a traffic system and a hub system," Mr. Carlzon said. 
"We have a lot to learn in Europe from the U.S." 

   Specifically, SAS plans to introduce daily non-stop service from Oslo, Norway, to Newark next May and move a flight that currently lands at JFK airport to Newark. 
It will sublet three gates and passenger service facilities at Continental's new Newark terminal. 
When Eastern completes $100 million of proposed renovations at JFK airport, the two companies will discuss similar service to New York. 

   The $50 million payment from SAS will be divided among the various Texas Air entities, with $25 million going to the parent corporation and $15 million to Continental for access to the Newark facility. 
The remaining $10 million will go to Eastern for access to Eastern facilities at JFK Airport in New York, when those facilities are completed. 

   Mr. Carlzon will become a member of the Texas Air board. 
As part of the agreement, Texas Air said it wouldn't fight SAS buying a stake in the company, which the European carrier said it would do within six months. 
The parties agreed that the stake wouldn't exceed 10% -- which is also the maximum interest a foreign carrier can hold in a U.S. carrier without U.S. government approval. 

   Mr. Lorenzo said SAS originally wanted to buy the 10% stake directly from Texas Air, but that he refused. 
"We didn't want to because we think our stock is too inexpensive and Texas Air doesn't have that kind of need for cash," he said. 

   In a statement, Mr. Lorenzo added: "Clearly, SAS thinks, as we do, that Texas Air shares are undervalued."

   STOCKHOLM -- Scandinavian Airlines System posted a big
pretax loss for 1990 and said that it expects to remain
unprofitable this year because of depressed airline markets
and continued restructuring costs.
   Jan Carlzon, chief executive officer, said that volatile
conditions in the airline industry made it practically
impossible to predict developments more than a few weeks
ahead.

<TEXT>
   The SAS group, which besides the airline includes hotel
and charter travel units, is 50%-owned by the governments of
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. It posted a 1990 pretax loss of
763 million Swedish kronor ($127.3 million) compared with
pretax profit of 2.2 billion kronor ($367.1 million) a year
earlier. Operating profit last year fell 48% to 649 million
kronor from 1.24 billion kronor in 1989.
   SAS boosted operating profit with 700 million kronor from
the sale of used aircraft and other fixed assets during the
year. However, affiliated companies -- mainly the
Inter-Continental Hotels Group plus Chile's flag carrier Lan
Chile -- produced losses of 156 million kronor last year,
compared with 1989 profit of 83 million kronor. The remaining
1990 operating profit was wiped out by 1.7 billion kronor in
one-time charges.
   The nonrecurring items included writedowns for
shareholdings in affiliated companies -- such as a 500
million kronor decline in the market value of SAS's 18.4%
voting stake in troubled Continental Airlines Holdings of the
U.S. Almost half of the one-time charges stemmed from a tough
cost-cutting program that is expected to eliminate 3,500 jobs
-- 17% of the total payroll -- at the airline division by the
end of 1992.
   Mr. Carlzon acknowledged that SAS almost certainly will
need to raise additional equity to complete the 20 billion
kronor of aircraft purchases it plans during the coming
decade. However, the three government holders have frequently
balked at injecting as much equity as management wanted. And
they will be stung by the SAS board's decision to omit a
dividend for 1990.

   STOCKHOLM -- Jan Carlzon, the flashy chief executive of
Scandinavian Airlines System, prides himself on being a deft
communicator.
   But Mr. Carlzon has had trouble lately explaining signs of
a retrenchment under way at the half-state-owned airline of
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. While he and other company
officials stubbornly defended their dream of building a
global travel empire, assets acquired amid fanfare in a late
1980s buying binge have been quietly put up for sale.
                                                                                                       

   At a five-hour seminar for Scandinavian journalists here
this week, Mr. Carlzon finally set the record straight-sort
of. "When I described our global travel service company
concept in the past, it may have sounded like everything was
equally important," he explained. "That's not true. What
we're doing is streamlining operations so that everything
complements the airline, which is overwhelmingly the most
important element in the travel service idea."
   To that end, Mr. Carlzon remains bullish on the purchase
of a big minority stake in Continental Airlines Holdings,
parent of U.S. carrier Continental Airlines. SAS credits its
link with Continental's domestic traffic system for an 85%
surge in transit passengers in the past two years -- and an
improvement of 100 million Swedish kronor ($16.3 million) a
year in operating results from North Atlantic traffic.
   The U.S. routes still aren't profitable. "But I'm afraid
to even think where we'd be today had we not bought into
Continental," Mr. Carlzon said.
   However, Mr. Carlzon admitted he now regrets other
acquisitions -- from the 40% stake in Inter-Continental
Hotels group bought for $500 million to a 35% holding in
Chile's flag carrier Lan Chile. "We still want to reach out
to business travelers on the ground as well as in the air.
But we can do that by operating hotels, we realize we don't
need to own them," he added.
   As a result, both the Inter-Continental and Lan Chile
stakes are now on the block, Mr. Carlzon said, though he
insists he'll bide his time until he is offered the right
price. The SAS chief played down recent reports that SAS will
shed the Inter-Continental stake by November. "There have
been discussions but no negotiations with our partner. We
haven't reached any agreement and there isn't any time scale
agreed on yet," he declared.
   "We're also looking for ways to sell the Lan Chile stake.
But since the airline isn't losing money any more it isn't
urgent," Mr. Carlzon said.
   But slashing costs no doubt is the top priority. In
January, the airline unveiled a plan to cut annual costs by
three billion kronor, or roughly 20%, in part by eliminating
3,500 jobs by the end of next year. A majority of unions
representing SAS employees have agreed to negotiate
contracts, but Mr. Carlzon remains bogged down in a bitter
struggle with pilots and flight attendants that some analysts
fear may cause walkouts before a settlement.
   But Mr. Carlzon can't afford to waver yet. Even if air
travel perks up about 1993, as many industry analysts expect,
he warned that SAS will have to keep up pressure on costs to
survive fierce competition in deregulated European skies.
   Other than more draconian staff cuts, the only way to
control costs is through tighter cooperation with Swissair
and Austrian Airlines, partners since late 1989 in what Mr.
Carlzon dubbed the European Quality Alliance. The three
airlines recently agreed to intensify cooperation in
marketing, product development and integrating traffic
systems.
   The objective is to create a common image in markets
around Europe virtually as strong as if the airlines merged.
Yet such a merger, Mr. Carlzon stressed, can't be
contemplated today.
   That's partly a consequence of SAS's tangled ownership
structure; SAS and Swissair still haven't figured out how to
swap stakes of 5% to 10% in each other as outlined under a
September 1989 accord. Moreover, SAS executives worry that a
merger could threaten landing rights each of the three
airlines holds in the U.S. and various parts of Asia.
   Still, cooperation short of marriage could still yield
annual cost savings of up to 500 million kronor a year, Mr.
Carlzon said. And he disclosed that "there's now talk of
British Midland Airways becoming an active partner in the
alliance."
   The addition of British Midland, whose parent, Airlines of
Britain Holdings PLC, is 25%-owned by SAS, would give the
European Quality Alliance a hotly desired London hub. London,
together with Zurich, Vienna and Copenhagen, would comprise
the strongest hub network of any airline grouping in Europe,
Mr. Carlzon boasted.
   A spokesman for British Midland, however, said the carrier
"has announced no plans" to join the alliance and called such
reports "conjecture." Nonetheless, he added, the joint
marketing arrangements that British Midland has with SAS
would no doubt be affected by the Scandinavian carrier's
entrance into a deeper marketing alliance with Austrian and
Swissair.
   In addition, even the wisdom of tightening relations among
Quality Alliance members has met resistance. Founding member
Finnair pulled out of the alliance following the decision,
although it has pledged to maintain bilateral links with
remaining members.
   Finnair Executive Vice President Henrik Arle said the
alliance did not boost passenger traffic or market share for
his carrier, and added that Finnair was uncomfortable with
plans to turn over certain decision-making powers to a
committee. The European Quality Alliance "was not a failure,
but the achievements were not that remarkable," he said.

   HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. reported an
unprecedented $2.25 billion fourth-quarter loss, the result
mainly of massive write-offs taken in an attempt to untangle
its complicated finances.
   The company, parent to Continental Airlines, blamed its
own bankruptcy filing, the liquidation of its Eastern
Airlines unit and the troubles besetting the entire airline
industry for the loss, which widened from a $362.8 million
loss in the year-earlier quarter. On a per-share basis, the
loss swelled to $52.37 from $9.17.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The write-downs, which account for more than 80% of the
latest-quarter loss, reflect efforts by Continental Holdings
to put behind it the controversial and debt-laden legacy of
former chairman Frank Lorenzo, who borrowed huge sums to
assemble Continental Holdings -- then known as Texas Air
Corp. -- from four ailing carriers. Continental Holdings and
all its subsidiaries sought Chapter 11 protection in
December, squeezed for cash by their huge debt load and high
jet fuel prices.
   "Many of these write-offs could have been taken in the
future," said Hollis L. Harris, the airline's chairman and
president. "But reporting all of these expenses now will
allow the company to concentrate its efforts on successfully
emerging from Chapter 11 unencumbered by past events."
   To be sure, Continental's losses weren't entirely the
result of one-time items. High fuel costs and a slowdown in
air travel combined to create a fourth quarter operating loss
at the holding company of $333.4 million. That loss was in
the same range as those posted by most airlines for the last
quarter.
   Mr. Hollis said he expected the nonrecurring, noncash
adjustments -- which totaled about $1.8 billion of the
quarterly loss -- to have no effect on continuing operations.
   Continental's stock felt the impact, falling 25 cents a
share to $3.25 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   "Obviously, what they did was, they wiped the table
clean," said Timothy Pettee, a transportation analyst with
Alliance Capital Management. "The surviving balance sheet is
probably as ugly as you could get." Mr. Pettee estimates that
Continental Holdings currently has a negative book value of
$77 a share as a result of the fourth-quarter results.
   Revenue declined 21% to $1.38 billion in the 1990 fourth
quarter from $1.73 billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1990, Continental had a net loss of $2.34
billion, or $57.52 a share, compared with a 1989 loss of
$885.6 million -- then a record -- or $22.71 a share. Revenue
fell 6.8% to $6.23 billion in 1990 from $6.68 billion in
1989.
   The 1989 figures include revenue from Eastern Airlines, a
unit operated by Continental Holdings until a bankruptcy
judge appointed a trustee to run it last April. Eastern
stopped flying in January, and Continental said it is writing
down $1.1 billion in connection with Eastern's liquidation.
   That includes more than $600 million Continental Holdings
is obliged to pay regarding Eastern's pension debt; about
$240 million for guarantees on Eastern's 11.36% preferred
stock; and some other, smaller liabilities.
   Continental Holdings said it expects to take a deferred
credit relating to its investment in Eastern, but won't do so
until it clears up potential litigation regarding the Eastern
bankruptcy case. The credit could total as much as $1.1
billion, but given Eastern's liquidation, Continental isn't
likely to receive anything close to that amount.
   Continental Holdings also said it was writing down $439.6
million, primarily in "good will" created as a result of its
various mergers and acquisitions in 1986 and 1987. That total
also includes various deferred expenses and debt discounts.
   The company also wrote off $270 million for impairment of
assets, most of which reflects the declining value of older,
noisier aircraft that generally will be banned by decade's
end. About 10% of the $270 million write-down covers
Continental's Denver terminal and maintenance hangar, which
it will have to give up in 1993 when it moves to new quarters
at the Denver airport currently under construction.
   Even after the one-time charges are accounted for, the
company's chief subsidiary, Continental Airlines, had hefty
losses of its own. The airline blamed those losses on jet
fuel expenses, which added $201 million to operating costs in
the third and fourth quarters. As a result, Continental
Airlines posted a fourth-quarter operating loss of $299.6
million on revenue of $1.3 billion. In the year-earlier
quarter, Continental Airlines had an operating loss of only
$8 million on revenue of $1.2 billion.

   Scandinavian Airlines System and Swissair announced plans to swap stakes of 5% to 10% in each other under a broad air-traffic and travel-services alliance. 

   The two carriers said the planned partnership will give them sufficient critical mass to be among five surviving Europe-based intercontinental carriers in a deregulated air industry of the 1990s. 
They said planned coordination of their traffic-systems, marketing and other functions would save about 200 million Swedish kronor ($31 million) a year. 
The gains are expected to multiply as cooperation evolves -- with resulting profits shared equally. 

   The plan, which was announced simultaneously in Zurich, Switzerland, and Stockholm, also is intended to include areas such as catering, hotels, fleet planning and product development. 
But most of the details remain to be worked out. 

   SAS Chief Executive Officer Jan Carlzon said that if the Swissair alliance develops according to plan, the level of cross-ownership will increase in the future. 
Swissair said representation on each other's boards may occur. 
Mr. Carlzon said existing partners such as Airlines of Britain PLC and Austrian Airlines could be included in the coordinated air-traffic scheme. 
In addition, he proposed that Finnair join the group. 

   Mr. Carlzon called Swissair "an ideal partner" with a similar strategy focused on business travelers and high-quality service. 
He said Swissair boasts the extensive long-haul network in Africa and the Middle East, places where SAS is weak. 

   Swissair said the two airlines initially will increase seat capacity on their flights linking Zurich and Geneva with the three Nordic capitals. 
Travelers from Scandinavia would then be able to fly to Switzerland and connect onto Swissair flights to, say, India or South Africa, while passengers from central Europe could fly to Copenhagen to connect to SAS flights to China and Japan. 
The two airlines could operate joint flights, split up frequencies by time or day or simply harmonize their existing schedules in Europe, Swissair said. 

   But the SAS chief acknowledged that Swissair's Zurich hub is less attractive than Brussels or other European capitals which SAS earlier considered as possible gateways for intercontinental routes. 
A couple of years ago, SAS tried very hard to arrange a merger with Sabena. 
Further, since SAS and Swissair have different partners in the U.S., the new alliance probably won't have much impact on North Atlantic traffic, SAS officials said. 

   SAS last year bought 10% of Texas Air Corp. as a way of cementing a marketing alliance with the U.S. concern's Continental Airlines unit. 
Recently, SAS had been talking to Texas Air about buying more or all of Continental, with U.S. partners. 
Swissair, meanwhile, in March signed a marketing deal with Delta Air Lines. 
Four months later, the two swapped 5% stakes, Swissair paying about $193 million and Delta about $77 million. 

   Swissair Chairman Armin Baltensweiler said the Delta tie-up gave his company extra incentive to reach an agreement with SAS. 
Between SAS and Delta, Swissair is closer to its goal of safeguarding its long-term competitiveness. 

   The agreement, approved by Swissair's board Wednesday and SAS directors yesterday, calls for an exchange of shares, but the exact size of the respective shareholdings will be the subject of further negotiations. 
So will the composition of the joint executive board that will steer the partnership. 

   SAS and Swissair intend to complete the share swap by the summer. 
But executives admit they haven't agreed on a method of valuation. 
SAS's complex ownership is another potential pitfall. 
Scandinavia's airline is half-owned by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish governments with the remaining 50% split among publicly traded holding companies in each of the three Nordic countries. 
Swissair is 23% owned by federal and cantonal authorities. 

   SAS and Swissair also said they intend to integrate their hotels under a global travel-service system. 
SAS owns 23 hotels directly and holds interests in 105 more through its 40% stake in Intercontinental Hotel Corp. acquired earlier this year.
