   The Uptown String Quartet (Philips) _ Diane Monroe and Lesa
Terry, violins; Maxine Roach, viola; Eileen M. Folson, Cello.
   
   And now for something completely different ...
   A listener needs a change now and again, and this disc from the
Uptown String Quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears.
   The name gives a clue _ a marriage of the string quartet with
the sounds from far uptown, beyond 110th Street in Manhattan. A big
shot of jazz, a little rag, a little blues, a lot of Polish.
   Listen to ``Midnight Child'' and it's evident why the mix is so
convincing. The virtuoso note-bending of the blues and gospel
singers was born for the violin. So, too, were the strutting
rhythms of ``Calvary,'' and doggone if Scott Joplin didn't have
strings in mind when he wrote ``Easy Winners.''
   It helps, too, that the four players are demon fiddlers, whose
various experiences include the Philadelphia Orchestra,
``Dreamgirls,'' the New York Philharmonic, Frank Sinatra, Sammy
Davis Jr., Wynton Marsalis and producer Max Roach's Double Quartet.
   Yes, it may seem a little strange, but this is no Beethoven's

   ``Trash'' (Epic) _ Alice Cooper
   
   Don Henley recently complained that pop music has become
moronic, which would mean that Alice Cooper was way ahead of his
time.
   Happily, two decades after the release of his first record,
Cooper still sounds moronic. ``Trash,'' his latest album, is
impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike.
   Don't be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought Cooper
spits out over grinding guitars. These tunes are cartoons _ they
have more in common with Sam Kinnison than Judas Priest.
   No image is too obvious for Cooper, which is half the fun. And
he shows cleverness in other ways. ``I'll drive you like a hammer
on a bed of nails,'' Cooper sings. Then the punch line: ``Ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow.''
   The band is head-banger friendly. Guitarist John McCurry nicely
frames Cooper's frenzy, and guest appearances by Aerosmith and Jon
Bon Jovi add to the fun.
   There are some dead spots, but such hormonal imbalances as ``I'm
Your Gun'' and ``This Maniac's in Love With You'' make ``Trash''
the funniest heavy-metal record since Spinal Tap. Whether Cooper
intended it to be that way is really immaterial.

(box) Alice Cooper: still shocking, Page 22  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's Operation Rock &amp; Roll. And in its way, it's just as scary.;    Think
of it. Five head-banging acts -- Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Motorhead,
Dangerous Toys and Metal Church -- all on the same stage going leather-bent
for hell in a heavy-metal basket, all at Shoreline Amphitheater, all on
Sunday.;    Awwwwwwright! Rocknnnnnnnrollllll! Getdowwwwwwn! Boooooogie!;   
There.;    Now that we've gotten that off our chest, we can get on with the
business at hand. Which is, oddly enough, the business of rock 'n' roll, which
is the basis of Operation Rock &amp; Roll.;    You thought this was an inspired
match made in metal heaven? Think again.;    Operation Rock &amp; Roll might be a
fan's delight -- six hours of metal madness. But it is also a part of the new
trend to market tours  like a Kellogg's Variety Pack. No more of those one-act
"An Evening With . . ." numbers. It's safety -- and ticket sales -- in
numbers, with groups being loaded onto tours to draw as many fans as
possible.;    In the case of the other tours such as the recent Gathering of
the Tribes and the upcoming Lollapalooza and Gang of Four/Public Enemy/Sisters
of Mercy/Warrior Soul slugfest, there has been an attempt to contribute to a
new openness in the music scene with an eclectic assortment of acts.;    But
not with Operation Rock &amp; Roll. It is strictly business. Pocket-calculator
time.;    All of the acts on this tour are allied in their affiliation with
the Columbia and Epic records labels (which are part of Sony Music). They
don't hang out at the local bar, swigging brewskies and clanging chords. Their
people got together with the Sony people and all of them decided that it was
time to cash in. (Ticket sales to the event are sluggish, tour sources say.); 
  And how will they cash in? Let us count the ways.;    For starters, there's
the "promotion-only" Operation Rock &amp; Roll audio cassette which comes with
songs by the five participating groups. A quarter-million of these have been
printed up for the tour to be used as giveaways in conjunction with local
shows. The first few thousand fans who get to each venue will also get free
copies. Nice, eh? Yes, but the cassette also comes with songs by other
Columbia and Epic acts, including Fishbone, War Babies and Cycle Sluts From
Hell, all the better to promote their records.;    Then there is the Operation
Rock &amp; Roll edition of MJI Broadcasting's syndicated "Metalshop" program,
which was aired July 4. It came with interviews with the tour's groups and
selections of their music.;    Then there is the new "Operation Rock &amp; Roll"
video (Sony Music) that was released July 2, just in time for start of the
tour Tuesday in Salt Lake City. It comes with videos by the groups of the
tour, for $19.95.;    Have we forgotten anything?;  Yes, there is music
involved in all of this. And -- given its metal base -- some of it might be
quite good. With its legal problems of 1990 resolved -- remember the Reno case
in which the group was exonerated of charges that its lyrics prompted a
suicide? -- Judas Priest seems to be alive and kicking.;    The same could be
said of the lovely and talented Alice. Mr. Cooper, to you, baffled critics and
fans and common sense by going platinum with his 1989 album, "Trash." It was a
real comeback -- professionally and musically -- with a Gothic rock sound that
was the equal of his classics. He should pull out all the props for this
tour.;    Motorhead is Motorhead. If I have to explain that to you, you
probably wouldn't understand anyway. For a decade and much more, this band has
made metal that is an unalloyed pleasure, untarnished by such trivial matters
as good taste and listenability.;    Mixing business and pleasure;  Metal
Church and Dangerous Toys haven't got the Big Names -- or the fanciful names
-- of their tour counterparts, but they might be interesting opening acts.;   
All of which makes the business side of this tour all the more annoying.
Operation Rock &amp; Roll could be fun and a real deal for the fans. But all the
marketing and promotional tie-ins prove that metal has become as much a
business as a pleasure.;     Operation Rock &amp; Roll; When: 5 p.m. Sunday;
Where: Shoreline Amphitheater, One Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View;
Tickets: $22.50/$18.50, (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  LET'S get to the most important question first: Is there a snake in Alice
Cooper's new act?;    "We do have a new snake for this tour," says Alice,
laughing. "We call him Salt Lake Sidney. He's a Mormon snake. He doesn't drink
coffee and he doesn't work on Sundays."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SCHOOL'S OUT, AND HERE COMES ALICE COOPER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Cooper, 43, is calling from Salt Lake City, where Operation Rock &amp; Roll
played this week (the show touches down here at 5 p.m. Sunday at Shoreline
Amphitheater). That explains the snake's name, he says.;    Fans will walk out
changed;    Sidney, it seems, is part of what the all-time master of
theatrical rock describes as "a real Alice Cooper show. We've got a set of our
own, very high-tech, with loads of real oooooo-ahhhh effects. At one point in
the act, we take fans from the crowd and put them on a Frankenstein table and
we lift it to the ceiling and when they come out, they're (pause) different.";
   In what way, Alice?;    "I really don't want to give anything away," he
says with another laugh. For such a gothic kind of guy, Alice is downright
upbeat.;    Keep in mind, we are talking about Alice Cooper, he of the
guillotine and black eye makeup and coiling snakes; the man who, in the '70s,
put the shock into rock. Along the way, he recorded a rock classic or two --
"I'm 18," "School's Out" -- and had a comeback platinum record, 1989's
"Trash.";    What sort of rock fans come to see Alice Cooper, these days?
Young, old or what?;    "I think the older ones come but they mostly sit in
the back. When I look at the crowd from the stage, the ones in the front are
usually about 15. You know, the ones with tattoos and no teeth.";    He's
laughing again.;    It's all about hits;    How has he been able to do it lo
these many years? Alice lowers his voice and gets down to business:;    "It's
about hits. 'I'm 18' is one of those songs that anyone can relate to. The
angst lives on. Theatrics without hits is novelty and that would get boring
after a while. But if you have the theatrics and the hits, that makes a show
with meaning. When we get the effects going and play the hits, we get 10,000
people going 'Oh, wow!' ";    To Alice Cooper, that's no laughing matter.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  LIKE her namesake in Wonderland, Woody Allen's Alice finds things becoming
curiouser and curiouser as she tumbles through her own mixed-up life. Unlike
Lewis Carroll's wanderer, Allen's heroine, played by Mia Farrow in the
souffle-airy "Alice," is fully grown and all too willing to play the
proverbial babe in the woods.;    Indeed, her friends refer to her (behind her
back) as "Miss Mouse . . . so trusting."  </LEADPARA>

See also related story on this page.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That Allen's heroine eventually sorts things out -- learns who's
dependable, who's not; what's up, what's down -- is more the result of luck,
coincidence and old-hat legerdemain than any real resourcefulness on her
part.;    Alice is, for all intents and purposes, a surrogate for Allen's
classic schlemiel. She even has that oh-so-; For page 7E;    Woody habit of
whining when no one's listening.;    Farrow's Alice, however, is in a
marvelous state of grace, where much befalls her but nothing does any real
harm. Alice is Allen'sFilm Review; dream-child or cockeyed optimist, someone
who can take the worst that life has to shell out without becoming jaded,
cynical.;    And life does throw Alice a few unexpected curves, including a
smug, philandering husband (William Hurt) and a pack of rich, devious
girlfriends (played by Australia's Judy Davis, among others).;    "I'm one of
those women who shop all day and have pedicures. I want to do more with my
life," Alice sort of complains.;    Alice's salvation comes during one of her
regular visits to the beauty salon/health spa. That's where she learns about a
Chinatown acupuncturist/magician named Dr. Yang (the late Keye Luke of
"Gremlins"). Yang pronounces Alice's chronic backache psychosomatic. He
prescribes hypnotism and an assortment of "special herbs." The hypnotism takes
her back to the start of her problems; the herbs have a more extreme effect,
causing her to become completely uninhibited and then -- shades of H.G. Wells!
-- invisible.;    The joke is that the timid-to-transparent Alice is at her
most vital and decisive as the Invisible Woman.;    It's while under another
of Yang's spells that Alice approaches Joe, a jazz musician whose daughter
attends the same kindergarten as Alice's daughter. In this uptown fairy tale's
funniest bit, the usually skittish Alice seduces Joe with every conceivable
saxophone double-entendre. Joe, played by Joe Mantegna of "Godfather III," is
understandably amazed.;    So how are we to take all this? Allen tips us off
with his music, which ranges from Dixieland jazz to deliriously romantic
standards (such as "Moonlight Becomes You") to canned studio music. This is
Allen doing a schizoid Noel Coward/naughty satyr routine. Little wonder the
results run the gamut from silly to sardonic.;    Enchanting and almost
frivolous, "Alice" has the feel of Allen on sabbatical from the angst-ridden
types of "September," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Another Woman" and, indeed,
the much-overrated "Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors." In tone, Allen's latest most
closely matches "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy" and the director's
contribution to "New York Stories." Like those works, this one is loosely
structured to the point of being haphazard, distracted. In spots, it feels
like Allen taking Dr. Yang's advice to Alice -- doing whatever feels right at
the moment.;    Allen's casting is certainly strange. Trading on his status as
America's most individualistic film maker -- the New York Ingmar Bergman, if
you will -- Allen has filled minor roles with such notables as Alec Baldwin,
Cybill Shepherd, Blythe Danner, Gwen Verdon and Bernadette Peters. Baldwin
appears as the ghost of an old beau; Shepherd is a suddenly disdainful friend
with a real career; Peters is Alice's amusingly bossy muse.;    Talking of
muses, in some respects this is Allen forsaking his inner voice for the voices
of others -- among them, Dickens, Carroll, Preston Sturges and, for a Peter
Pan-inspired joyride over Manhattan, J.M. Barrie.;    The latter adventure is
the perfect metaphor for this lighter-than-air concoction, which attempts to
sneak up on serious matters about self-worth. The strategy doesn't always
work, as Allen scores his biggest laughs with his most obvious bits (about
bored homemakers and jaded New York cabbies), but it does make for a pleasant
enough diversion, like a promenade along Fifth Avenue in the fall.;    More,
it gives Farrow her best screen role since "The Purple Rose of Cairo." Farrow,
who has never looked lovelier, really comes into her own with this one. Here
finally is the opportunity to show her true range as a comedian, a range that
encompasses screwball antics and a waif-like girlishness.;    Like Alice,
Farrow has been at a crossroads for some time. With her 11th feature with
Allen, the actress commits to a definite path and demonstrates a playful
sexuality that's darn-near irresistible.; Alice; (star)(star) 1/2; Rated:
PG-13 (slight profanity); Cast: Mia Farrow, William Hurt, Joe Mantegna;

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- Last summer my mother-in-law, "Alice," was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease. If this dear lady had died, the entire community would
have grieved with us, but as it is, well-meaning friends, who know nothing
about Alzheimer's and happen to visit Alice on one of her good days, think we
are terrible people.;    We get calls asking why we haven't been to visit
Alice in several weeks when, in fact, we go to see her every day. She gets on
the phone and tells people she is in terrible pain and that we refuse to spend
money on a doctor to find out what is wrong. The truth is we have spent $8,000
on diagnostic tests and the results show that she is in excellent health. The
nursing home we have placed her in costs $3,100 a month.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yesterday a friend of Alice's phoned to plead that we take her "out of

institution." I tried to explain that we cannot keep her at home because she
needs around-the-clock care. I didn't want to mention her urinating on the
floor, the need to change her bed linens four or five times a day, or the
times she has wandered outside totally unclothed.;    With the grief of
Alice's illness and dealing daily with her problems, the added stress of these
"friends" is more than we can take. Do you have solutions for handling these
people?;    -- C.H. in Spokane;    DEAR SPOKANE -- It is difficult for those
who haven't had experience with Alzheimer's to understand the heartbreak. It

Association, P.O. Box 5675-AL, Chicago, Ill. 60680-5675. You need a support
group and they will help you find it. Good luck.;    DEAR ANN -- My girlfriend
and I have a problem and I admit it's my fault. Molly (not her real name) has
slept with several other men, and most of them are from my hometown.;   
Whenever Molly and I attend a party, there is a good chance that at least one
of her former bed partners will be there. When this happens, I can think of
nothing but that guy in bed with her and my evening is wrecked.;    Molly
asks, "What's the matter?" When I tell her, she says I'm being juvenile and we
end up in a terrible argument. When we get intimate, I have a tough time
blocking out thoughts of the other guys and it ruins my mood.;    How can I
get rid of these thoughts that are wrecking our relationship?;    -- Matter
Over Mind in Massachusetts; DEAR MIND -- Too bad Molly broke one of the most
important rules of developing a new relationship: Never divulge the names and
numbers of previous players.;    Try a few sessions with a counselor. You may
then be able to accept Molly for what she is and forget the past. If this
doesn't work, tell her goodbye because you'll never make it together. P.S.

Church had the thankless job of opening this debacle. And it must be said that
the group did have a raw power and energy that got the crowd -- what there was
of it -- up and moving. Vocalist Mike Howe and his mates have a trace of the
punk-based bite that they did when they started out 10 years ago, and they
used it in a set that was, if nothing else, exciting. But, in fact, there was
nothing else to Metal Church.;    Nor to Dangerous Toys, which displayed the
usual metal cliches with an arena-rock slickness that was boring and annoying.
The Metal Book says that every group should play noisy rock and have a shrill
vocalist and guitarists who squeeze off volleys of notes. And all the troops
of Operation Rock &amp; Roll obviously have been doing their reading.;    One of
the guys who wrote that book, Lemmy of Motorhead, was on hand for the event.
In the '70s, it was Lemmy who helped to reduce metal from a viable creative
form to a sort of tag-team contest of sound. And, at this show, he was in
form, shouting out his lyrics like a wino in search of a street corner.
Motorhead performed with a monolithic abandon, with guitarist Wurzel providing
an errant blues phrase or two to remind us where metal came from eons ago. But
for the most part its set wasn't about songs as much as sound -- pure,
ear-melting sound.;    Cooper's conviction intact;    Alice Cooper came next.
Now, Cooper isn't a real metalist. He uses the style as an aural scrim on
which he projects his theatrical visions. With metal blaring in the
background, he entered the stage from the gaping mouth of a skull and --
depending on one's tastes in such matters -- got either better or worse from
there. At various points he hugged a snake -- the lovely and talented Salt
Lake Sidney -- and grabbed a "fan" from the crowd, strapped her onto a
"Frankenstein table" and turned her into a monster, which he proceeded to
assault and cast aside. During "School's Out," he kicked a bunch of gigantic
balloons into the crowd, sticking them with a saber, which made them explode
into clouds of multicolored confetti.;    Whew!;    Yes, it was silly and
hokey. And in his black, studded leather tights, Cooper's stooped posture made
him look like a hilarious version of the Alien (although that creature would
never have worn such flashy eye makeup).;    But Cooper's garish set also came
with Cooper's songs, which made the effects worth the time and bother. "I'm
18" is one of the teen angst classics of all time, and Cooper sang it with a
conviction that masked his 43 years. And 1989's "Poison" was equally
wonderful, not metal as much as unalloyed pop. And his new "Hey Stoopid" had a
hook-laden grandeur that was smashing; it even survived a thorough trashing
from guest guitarist Joe Satriani. Cooper endures because his music does the
same, and he and it made his performance a pleasure.;    A tired Judas Priest;
   Judas Priest has endured, as well. But not, as it were, well.;    Vocalist
Rob Halford came onstage on his Harley, the way he usually does. And K. K.
Downing and Glenn Tipton provided the fleeting and screaming guitar licks that
have provided Priest's punch over its long career. And with its high-tech set
and glaring and arcing spotlights and explosions and the rest, Priest did give
the crowd its money's worth.;    But the group seemed archaic and tired, as if
it had done one tour too many along the line. Even newer songs like "A Touch
of Evil" and the title cut from its most recent album, "Painkiller," sounded
like the Priest was playing on the sound of its past instead of trying
anything fresh.;    But then metal has never had much to do with such things.
It's about street-warrior poses and the same old licks and a "rebellious"
attitude that is oddly conservative in its conformity. In modest doses, its
various idiocies can be enjoyable and charming in their way.;    But seven
hours of it at one sitting was too much of a bad thing.  </TEXT>

   Film: An Old Man's Travels in His Memory

   Every once in a while a movie feels as if it's come out of
your own dreams -- even if nothing in it remotely resembles
the details of your real life or your fantasy life. "Night of
the Shooting Stars," for example, was such a film for me,
though nothing in my memory resembled the movie's surreal
story of Tuscan peasants fleeing their village in the final
days of World War II.
   "Toto Le Heros," a mesmerizing new Belgian film,
deliberately sets out to be a movie of dreams. It's the story
of an old man's determination to figure out what his life has
been -- if it's been anything at all -- before he dies. The
life has been depressing, but director Jaco Van Dormael turns
the old man's journey through memory and fantasy into a
startling, buoyant adventure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Van Dormael, directing a full-length feature for the
first time here, performed as a clown for Belgium's Big
Flying Circus before he turned to film. That makes perfect
sense. "Toto" has the spirit of a great circus -- exciting
and delightful yet sad and dangerous as well.
   Michel Bouquet is intense and perfectly unsentimental
playing "Toto" as a cranky old man who's been deposited in a
nursing home. His real name is Thomas, but he thinks of
himself, secretly, as Toto, an action hero modeled on a
television hero. He dreams of rebellion. When a nurse dumps
pills in a cup for him he fantasizes about grabbing her and
stuffing a whole bottle of the pills down her throat.
   But mainly he's obsessed with murdering someone named
Alfred. "I'll kill you, I'll kill you Alfred" are the first
words he utters in the film.
   He's convinced that Alfred stole his life, that he and
Alfred were switched at birth in a hospital fire, and that he
should have lived the charmed life he's sure Alfred's been
living. Like everything in Thomas's imagination, that fire is
vividly presented on screen, a nightmarish vision of a
nursery on fire. And even though Thomas believes that fire
was real, he's also convinced his life was a bore. "Nothing
ever happened is this guy's story," he says.
   His life as a child, however, was fantastic, the way Mr.
Van Dormael shows it, as a playful fable told from the point
of view of a little boy with a lively mind. Young Thomas
remembers his parents telling him he fell from the sky and
was found by his parents, a cheery couple who have the bouncy
pep and humor of a '60s sitcom mom and dad.
   Dad, an airplane pilot, does magic tricks for his kids and
sings them funny songs. That memory is staged like an antic
bit from a Vincente Minelli musical. Dad sings "The Singing
Fool" (with the lyric "Boom] The sun goes boom]") while
bright tulips sway to the beat on the front lawn.
   That glorious vision wasn't entirely accurate, even in the
golden period of Thomas's youth. Not everything was perfect.
Thomas's little brother had Down's syndrome, but was
good-natured even when neighborhood kids tormented him.
Thomas had to endure the ridicule of his next-door neighbor
Alfred, the smug rich boy who Thomas believed was living with
the wrong parents. Still, Alice, Thomas's older sister, was
perfection, the exquisite object of a little boy's vaguely
incestuous adoration. When Alice begins to flirt with Alfred,
Thomas finds new, urgent reasons to hate the boy next door.
   The scenes between Thomas Godet, the actor playing little
Thomas, and Sandrine Blancke as Alice are exquisite. He
worships her. You can see it in the way he looks at her, even
before he informs her that the Egyptian queen Nefertiti
married her brother. Skinny little Ms. Blancke has a
remarkable presence. You understand why Thomas gets so
shivery when she climbs into bed with him and casually asks
him if he likes her hands, her feet, her legs.
   Still, things were pretty ideal until they went "boom."
Thomas's father was killed flying goods across the English
Channel for Alfred's father. When the film moves into the
middle years of Thomas's memory, the brightness is gone. He's
become a drab bureaucrat, played with acute misery by Jo De
Backer.
   Thomas has never stopped being obsessed by his sister and
has never been able to replace the warm goofiness of his
childhood home. One day he sees a woman who resembles his
sister and he follows her. For a time he's brought back to
life, only to find that she's married to his old neighbor,
Alfred.
   Mr. Van Dormael, who also wrote the screenplay, skips
around time, as he sifts through Thomas's memory, as Thomas
tries to understand his lifelong feud with Alfred. The scenes
from Thomas's childhood seem to take place in the '60s,
judging by artifacts like cars and television sets. That puts
the "contemporary" scenes of Thomas as an old man somewhere
in the future. The movie feels timeless, the way memory does,
picking an instance from one era to make a connection with
something that may have happened a dozen years later. There's
no fake, insulting uplift in this story of missed
opportunities and lost lives. But when you walk out of the
theater you'll feel just wonderful.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: John Boorman beautifully mingled nostalgia with
horror in "Hope and Glory," his picture about his boyhood
experiences during the London blitz. Though it's quite
different from "Toto Le Heros" in style and story, its spirit
seems strangely similar to that of the Van Dormael film.

<HEAD>Singer Alice Cooper Says He is Write-In Candidate for Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shock-rock star Alice Cooper, who says he
bought his first car years ago from impeached Arizona Gov. Evan
Mecham, has half-serious plans to run for political office in his
home state.
   ``I'm definitely a write-in candidate,'' said the Phoenix-born
singer. ``Hey, I'm a native. I'm a registered voter. I represent
the Wild Party and I even have a campaign slogan: `Alice Cooper _ A
troubled man for troubled times.'''
   Cooper, 39, is in Phoenix for a show Saturday night that will
end the American leg of his year-long comeback tour.
   Cooper, born Vincent Furnier, a minister's son, said he bought
his first automobile from Mecham, who owned and operated a Pontiac
dealership in nearby Glendale. Cooper went on to fame with his
outrageous makeup and performances, as well as such hits as
``School's Out.''
   The Republican governor, who took office in January 1987, was
recently indicted by a state grand jury for attempting to conceal a
$350,000 campaign loan. Mecham is facing both a criminal trial this
month and a May 17 recall election.

<HEAD>The Kind of Cooperative Victorian Women Could Have Used</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the J-K volume of a recent
Encyclopedia Brittanica, the writer Henry James has a six-column
entry. His sister, Alice, is given no mention at all.
   The 19th-century diarist never succeeded in establishing herself
as a talent, which seemed a literary crime to the small group of men
and women who founded a writers' collective in her name.
   Alice James Books, an independent press that emphasizes women's
work, was conceived in 1972 as a strike against not only Victorian
mores, but also against the male-dominated reading lists most
college freshmen were studying in the 1970s.
   ``At the time, the people who sat in the important chairs at the
publishing houses were men,'' said Marjorie Fletcher, a poet and
co-founder. ``It was far easier to get a book on baseball into print
than one by a woman or about women's issues.''
   The collective publishes about 2,100 copies each of two books of
poetry every summer and spring. Its authors vary in age, race and
lifestyle, but they all share in the ideals from which the
non-profit enterprise grew.
   When Alice James writers agree to join the cooperative, they
agree to nurture their colleagues as well as their own work.
   So far about 70 authors have made the two-year commitment, during
which they guide their own book into print. Three have received
Beatrice Hawley Awards, a grant named after the poet that allows
poets outside of New England to publish.
   Rosamond Rosenmeier is just wrapping up work on her first
collection, ``Lines Out,'' which appears this fall.
   ``The experience is extraordinary,'' says Rosenmeier, a writing
professor at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
   With the help of a ``buddy,'' a veteran collective member who's
already been through the process, she has taken her book from pen
and paper to its final production stages.
   ``It's definitely my book,'' Rosenmeier said. ``I've had a hand
in everything: choosing the print, negotiating with the typesetter,
picking the cover design. We even did the paste-up.''
   That participation and the support collective members lend one
another are part of the philosophy inspired by Alice James, who
struggled in the shadow of her five brothers, including Henry and
William, a prominent psychologist.
   Henry James, the author of such works as ``Portrait of a Lady''
and ``The Ambassadors,'' was so unsettled by his sister's diaries,
which he considered an invasion of privacy, that he burned his copy,
according to biographers..
   ``She was a talented woman who never had a chance to develop,''
Fletcher said of Alice James, who died at the age of 43.
   Today, Fletcher says, it's a whole new ballgame. Women have
gained widespread acceptance, so much so that the collective has
begun casting its net wider and more actively soliciting minority
writers.
   Inclusion is the idea.
   Rosenmeier chuckles to think of the group's regular Sunday
afternoon meetings. ``We're all so different,'' she says. About a
dozen writers from all walks of life gather at one member's home,
bringing with them plenty of pasta salad, fruit, cheese and wine.
   Fletcher says it's funny to watch everyone file in when the
meeting convenes.
   ``Everybody finds a chair that somehow issues from her
personality. Some sit on the floor, the clubby people sit on the
couch. I sit on a chair,'' she says.
   The business of running and promoting Alice James is always high
on the meeting's agenda. The authors take no salary, but revenue
from limited sales through catalogs, book fairs and a few stores is
far from enough to sustain the collective's budget.
   The press relies in large part on state, federal and private
grants, which Fletcher said have dwindled steadily, particularly
under the strain of Massachusetts' current fiscal crisis.
   But Jenney Milner, a part-time office manager and the only paid
employee, said the gatherings inevitably swerve from the pragmatic
to a free-for-all.
   ``That's when they get interesting,'' she said, ``when we talk
about the philosophy of the press.''
   And, adds Fletcher, ``The vagaries of the commercial world or
damned luck can't change our commitment to empowerment, to fairness,
to our philosophy.''

   Jazz legend Lionel Hampton announced that a
$20,000 grant the National Endowment for the Arts is giving to a
foundation under his control will be channeled to a music school
named in his honor.
   Hampton spoke Wednesday to the Moscow Chamber of Commerce while
visiting the Panhandle college town to headline the University of
Idaho's jazz festival and receive an honorary degree.
   ``I always enjoy coming out here because this is a place where
high school students, college students, professional people and
educators and jazz musicians can come together in a common cause to
listen and improve the great art we foster,'' Hampton said.
   Dozens of the world's top jazz performers have come out of
Hampton's bands. But he said he has gotten the most pleasure from
having the university's Lionel Hampton School of Music named after
him, which he said is ``like going to heaven.''
   Hampton started his career in the 1920s. When he joined Benny
Goodman's quartet in 1936, he broke a color barrier that had kept
black musicians out of American entertainment's front ranks.

   ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak says that
just because CBS is giving him a talk show opposite NBC's ``Tonight
Show'' doesn't mean he's taking on Johnny Carson.
   ``If you're going to do a late-night show, that's a fact of
life, that Mr. Carson is going to be there. We can't worry about
that. We have to worry about doing the best show we can,'' Sajak
said at a news conference Wednesday.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters confirmed plans for
the show, which he said would be 90 minutes compared with Carson's
hour and would debut next January.
   ``There is no attempt on our part here to compete with Johnny
Carson,'' LeMasters said. ``Mr. Carson is a tradition, he is
much-beloved and a brilliant performer in what he does, and that's
not our aim. Our aim is that the environment in late night can
stand more than just one talk-show format.''
   Sajak will continue indefinitely as host of the nighttime
version of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' the nation's No. 1 syndicated
show. His contract for the NBC daytime version of the show expires
in December.

   Hugh Hefner's former live-in girlfriend upped
the ante in her ``palimony'' suit against the Playboy magazine
publisher, saying she now wants $35 million to prevent him from
ruining other young lives.
   Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson filed an amended
complaint Wednesday for Carrie Leigh adding fraud and deceit to her
previous accusations that Hefner abandoned promises to support and
father her child.
   Hefner attorney Anthony Michael Glassman said the fraud and
deceit claims were unfounded. He called the lawsuit revision a
publicity stunt.
   Miss Leigh's suit now seeks $20 million in punitive damages ``to
dissuade him from maintaining his long-enjoyed practice of seducing
teen-age girls, supporting them for a few years and then discarding
them.''
   The initial complaint filed Feb. 11 in Superior Court sought an
estimated $5 million-plus, but the amendment adds the punitive
amount and says lost career earnings and benefits amount to $15
million. Miss Leigh, 24, claims she gave up a modeling career in
1983 to serve as a companion at the Playboy Mansion to Hefner, 61.
   Mitchelson said the relationship ended with the arrival at the
mansion of Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with PTL minister
Jim Bakker led to the evangelist's fall from grace.

   A pickup truck driver who crashed through
the front gate of Sean Penn's and Madonna's home was placed on
three years' probation and ordered to pay the couple $3,000 for
damages.
   Steven Stillbower, 33, of Anaheim, pleaded no contest Wednesday
to misdemeanor counts of vandalism and peeking into the window of
the celebrity couple's home.
   In addition to placing him on probation and ordering restitution
to actor Penn and his pop singer wife, Municipal Court Judge
Lawrence Mira fined Stillbower $2,000.
   After Stillbower crashed his pickup truck Jan. 7, Penn placed
him under citizen's arrest. State law permits a person to make a
citizen's arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence.

<LEADPARA>  I SHALL invent a woman. I shall make her a lawyer. She has gone to a good
college and then to law school, and now works in a Washington firm. She earns
good, not great, money and it's too soon to tell if she'll make partner. She
is 5 feet 6 inches tall and attractive -- at least I think so. Her name is
Alice, and several times a year she is called upon to celebrate what she
considers to be her relative failure.;   What does she mean by that? It's
this. You may have noticed from the description above that Alice is not
married. She has no children either. She is 30 (did I tell you that?); not
old, but neither is it young. It is slowly dawning on Alice that she may never
marry.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ALICE IN SINGLEHOOD: WHEN IS HER TURN, SHE WONDERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cohen is a columnist for the Washington Post.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Alice is not yet panicked. Anyway, she has a plan. If she is not married
by, say, 35, she will adopt a child. But even before that, she intends to
register at various department stores. She will stipulate her choice in
silverware and china and -- why not? -- linens as well. She will tell her
friends where she is registered, and then she will invite them all to mark
with her the passage of that 35th year, when, she feels, she will pass
irrevocably into singlehood. Why should only married people get to have all
the gifts?;   It sometimes seems to Alice that her life is a wearying round of
parties and weddings, showers and more parties. She is asked to celebrate what
she is coming to see as reminders of her own failure: the engagements,
weddings and babies of others. Each invitation is like a flunking report card.
Alice has a nightmare. She is on a treadmill, loaded with gifts from Tiffany's
and Baccarat, price tags trailing behind her, trudging from one party to
another against a stiff wind, getting no closer to her goal.;   Alice operates
on her own fiscal year of September to September. This has been an expensive
year. Alice has bought a crystal bourbon decanter from Tiffany's. She has
bought a sandbox kit for a child's birthday. She has bought ceramic bookends,
a nightgown, a silver casserole set, some flatware, a crystal bowl, two
crystal wine coasters and some china -- a plate, a bowl and a cup. She lists
these items, always citing the manufacturer and approximate price. Alice
thinks she spent about $600 on such gifts. It's a bit of change.;   But the
money is the least of her complaints, although it's not unimportant. Instead,
she resents the effort that she expends on people who, it seems to her, are
already blessed. Why should the single be called on to celebrate the married?
Why should the childless have to buy gifts for the people with children? Why
do the unfortunate have to celebrate the good fortune of the fortunate? This
is what's bothering Alice. When, oh when, will her turn come?;   How did this
happen? Alice doesn't really know. There were guys, some close calls, an
engagement made or nearly made or maybe one broken. Alice kept exercising
choice -- not just bumper sticker "choice" about abortion, but other choices
as well. She chose this college and that graduate school and this career and
that guy and this city and then another guy and then another career and then.
. . . And then, somehow, Alice ran out of choices.;   Alice is out shopping
right now. She is shopping a lot of the time. When she is not actually
shopping, she is thinking about it. She plans her gifts. She cares about what
she will give. When she sees something in a store, she makes a note of it. She
started doing this kind of thing years ago. She assumed, without actually
thinking it out, that when her time came, people would buy gifts for her just
as carefully. Reciprocity, she thought. She hoped. So far, though, nothing has
come back.;   A colleague is pregnant. Alice, come to the party. A friend is
getting married. Alice, here's your invitation. Alice's college roommate has
given birth, her second. Alice, can you come to the party -- at their summer
home on the dunes? Children have birthdays and the divorced remarry and the
single get hitched. The invitations arrive like Scuds, tiny thuds that build
in intensity as the years go by. Before one hits real close, Alice is going to
announce her own celebration and register for her stuff.;   Alice is my
invention. She did not go to college or to law school and does not now
practice law -- trademark infringement, actually. She is not single and
childless and she did not spend $27.10 on a monogrammed sandbox kit for a
child that someone else had. Alice, my invention, does not exist. If she did,
she'd break your heart.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     King is a talented maverick who does what he wants, his way, without paying
much attention to the questions of marketing and audience appeal that bedevil
most arts organizations. So what if all my pieces look alike? he seems to
shrug. They're not.;    The subtle distinctions between them are organic,
coming directly out of the music, which is invariably ambitious, unusual and
sophisticated. This program featured off-the-beaten-track Bach; Donald
Fontowitz, a frequent collaborator; and Charles Valentin Alkan, Sofia
Gubaidulina and Bohuslav Martinu -- not exactly household names but all makers
of wondrous music.;    "Without Wax" (1990), made for BalletMet of Columbus,
Ohio, is a very special work, and its title says a great deal about King. It
comes from a custom in Roman times, when sculptors signed their work "sine
cereus" to show that no artificial smootheners were used to disguise nicks,
flaws and cracks. It's an indication of integrity, though it may leave the art
looking grainy or rough-hewn.;    So with the piece. King's company has strong
women and weak men, but he presents all proudly: These are his dancers; take
them for all in all.;    Much of it is danced to silence, which demands great
ensemble awareness and instinct; the silvery, thin, celestial streaks of
"Rejoice for Violin and Cello" by Gubaidulina, a contemporary Soviet composer,
are less musical background than evocative sound effects. There's an
invocation for men, a response for the women, a finale for all; and at the
center, a sumptuous pas de deux for Summer Lee Rhatigan and Gregory Dawson,
set to a heart-breaking score by Martinu (1890-1952).;    The program also
included revivals of "Toccata in D minor" (1990), the duet from "Alkan"
(1989), by far the best section of King's one-act homage to the eccentric
French pianist and composer (1813-88); and "Awake in the Dream," made for
Sacramento Ballet in 1988.;    The last is a post-apocalyptic dreamscape for a
single woman in blue (Katherine Warner) and a heartless group who turn on her.
King seems determined not to give us any clues about the internal narrative,
and the ballet's edge of menace is somewhat dulled by his elliptical
story-telling.;    Alice in Balletland; "The Adventures of Alice," the
ambitious new spring production of San Jose Dance Theater, is the start of a
wonderful children's ballet. Only the start, mind you, but a good healthy
one.;    This immense work -- 120 dancers, 160 costumes, seven flexible
set-pieces called periaktoi (their origin is in Hellenic theater), lights and
fog, a commissioned score for 11 instrumentalists, vocal quartet and
electronics -- was put together in just three months. This in itself is a
miracle. Getting the bugs out can be left for next year, for the company would
like to make "Alice" an annual event, on the order of "Nutcracker.";    More
words;  Right now, it badly needs a libretto, and probably a voiceover
narrator. What has been created by choreographer Jody White, a dance teacher
from Fairfax in Marin County, is not so much "The Adventures of Alice" as
"Episodes From 'Alice.' " There are a few scenes and characters from "Alice in
Wonderland," but the bulk of the ballet is taken from the less familiar
"Through the Looking-Glass.";    I would be tempted to scrub the "Alice"
sections entirely and expand the piece into a "Looking-Glass" ballet, except
the noble polonaise for the Gryphon, the Mock Turtle and Alice is very
beautiful and, moreover, the high point of composer Henry Mollicone's charming
score.;    In rehearsal, to help the dancers (Jennifer Larsen as the Gryphon
and Griffin Dong as the Mock Turtle) establish the proper mood, White was
inspired to say, "Think of the Gryphon as an endangered species." They caught
on immediately, and the dance is fragile and wistful, steps from a bygone
era.;    White's most effective device is to have Alice (15-year-old Sharon
Wehner) end the ballet by leaving the stage and opening one of the exit doors
of the house, where golden sunlight streams in, returning her to reality.;   
Other good episodes are "Jabberwocky," featuring David Roxander, White's son,
a former principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada, as the Beamish
Boy; the war of the chess pieces, accomplished by strobe lights and the
harmless but showy explosions of flash pots; and the Queen of Hearts' garden,
where the white roses are painted red by the gardening staff.;    On the down
side, there are a lot of terrific costumes wasted on characters who barely
appear, such as the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse. And the
senior dancers of the company dribble by in a floral episode that has nothing
to do with the story.;    When I saw the piece at dress rehearsal, it was
severely overcast by machine-made fog, and the lights, by Brad Belleville,
were prosaic. Some of these problems may have been corrected for the
performances; if not, there's always next year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     A young Manhattan matron, unhappy with her pampered but sterile life, finds
escape by realizing her childhood dreams of  helping the poor a la Mother
Teresa.;    Catholicism -- its institutions, rituals and unique moral and
ethical world view -- has long fascinated filmmakers, both of and outside the
faith, and it seems to be everywhere on screen lately.;    Its presence is
nowhere so pronounced as in "The Godfather Part III," in which Michael
Corleone enlists the Vatican in his final maneuver to make the family business
legitimate -- and unexpectedly finds in the sacrament of confession some
measure of personal redemption.;    From the start, the church has always
figured in the "Godfather" saga -- think of all the weddings, baptisms and
other ceremonies Francis Ford Coppola has used as set pieces. In this third
installment, Coppola has made it a major player in the Corleone family's
fortunes.;    The film depicts the Roman Catholic Church at its best and
worst. A principal villain is a corrupt Vatican treasurer, who proves to be no
more trustworthy than any of the mob figures Michael has dispatched over the
years.;    On the advice of an old Sicilian mentor, Michael approaches a
friendlier power broker, Cardinal Lamberto. But Lamberto sincerely cares about
Michael's soul, and the price he exacts for his cooperation is Michael's
confession.;    Michael initially demurs. He can confess, he tells Lamberto,
but he cannot repent.;    But the cardinal gently insists, and reluctantly
Michael sketches out a lifetime of cold-blooded murder capped by the
"Godfather II"-closing assassination of his own brother.;    As he actually
speaks the unspeakable, however, something happens: In one of Al Pacino's most
powerful performances in the film, Michael breaks down. It's an unforgettable
scene that is also as eloquent an endorsement of the faith as has been seen on
the big screen.;    Salvation of another sort is the carrot that lures Winona
Ryder, as Cher's adolescent daughter Charlotte, to Catholicism in "Mermaids."
Cher's character, Rachel Flax, is a gypsy soul whose obvious love for her two
daughters doesn't quite compensate for her inability to handle the commitment
required to maintain a stable home or even cook a normal meal.;    Charlotte
may not know what she's looking for, but she's certain it isn't her mom's
endless parade of lovers and annoying habit of moving to a new town whenever a
love affair ends.;    Out of some conviction that the sins of the mother can
be expiated by the daughter, Charlotte turns to Catholicism, a religion imbued
with the kind of discipline so lacking in her home life. She sets up shrines
in her bedroom, dreams of becoming a nun (one way of avoiding the kind of
messy situations her mother's love life creates) and, when her own nascent
sexuality rears its bothersome head, consults religious tracts for advice.;   
There's plenty of comedy to be mined from the spectacle of a pretty young
Jewish girl trying desperately to solve her problems by wearing black dresses
and clunky shoes and quoting the saints -- and director Richard Benjamin
doesn't let any opportunity go by.;    In the end, Charlotte's Catholicism is
only an adolescent passion; she embraces and outgrows it much the way other
kids go through a heavy metal or punk phase. Small wonder her mother never
worries about it too much: It's a lot less noisy than rock 'n' roll.;    In
Woody Allen's "Alice," Mia Farrow plays a good Catholic girl who has lost her
way in the material world of the '80s. She has everything money can buy but is
poor in the intangibles that really matter. Under the ministrations of a
Chinese herbalist (played by Keye Luke), she cuts through the pretenses that
have been cushioning her pain and finds in herself the idealist who once
wanted only to do good for others.;    Farrow's Catholicism, however, is like
Allen's Judaism: Its main attribute is a persistent sense of guilt that keeps
her loyal to her faithless and patronizing husband. You don't see her hanging
around churches or going to a priest with her problems. At first, she doesn't
even realize she has them, and it's the forthright Chinese herbalist who acts
as her father confessor.;    Allen isn't really out to paint a full-blown
portrait of a Catholic woman. Alice's faith is a manifestation of her basic
goodness: The point is to show up the people that surround her as selfish,
uncaring jerks.;    Ultimately, Alice's story is that of a woman who takes off
her rose-colored glasses and learns to look for answers, not in any
pre-fabricated social or religious framework, but within herself.;    The
Catholic Church has long been a presence in films from Europe, which is not
surprising, since the histories of the continent and the church are
inseparable.;    Over the years, there have been Catholic-themed comedies
("Nuns on the Run" and a remake of "We're No Angels" recently), murder
mysteries ("True Confessions") and horror films ("The Exorcist" and its
sequels).;    There are many reasons why the Catholic Church pops up in so
many films: the rich visual imagery of Catholicism, its lush liturgical music,
its history and rituals lend a majesty that is lacking in contemporary
American life.;    It's a faith that has weathered drastic social change with
minimal change outside the abandonment of the Latin mass and permitting the
consumption of meat on Fridays.;    Like Judaism, Catholicism is a religion
that people can't get away from, even those who give it up (ever hear of a
lapsed Protestant?) -- and that makes it almost an ethnicity.;    All of this
is fine fare for filmmaking. There's a metaphor for almost everything in
Catholicism, and a faith this grounded in tradition provides a fine framework
for almost any consideration of our secular society. There may be a shortage
of priests, but, in movies, Catholicism is thriving.  </TEXT>

IF ALICE FELL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE, RACHEL IS A CAT BEING DRAGGED THROUGH A 
KNOTHOLE.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ANN VAN DER VEER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Lucas' black comedy "Reckless" has found the right director. Pope 
Freeman's intense multilayered production at Santa Barbara City College's 
Studio Theater is reminiscent of Antonin Artaud's "theater of cruelty." And it 
corroborates Jerzy Grotowski's theory that the content of theater should be 
"myths of the blood" rather than fictions bearing on social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The plot has Rachel, a sort of 20th-Century Alice in Wonderland, catapulted 
through a series of events that ostensibly have to do with social life and 
behavior -- but which may be fantasy, dream, memory or all three. Catapulted is 
not a strong enough image; if Alice fell down the rabbit hole, Rachel is a cat 
being dragged through a knothole. 
</P>
<P>
It starts on Christmas Eve. Rachel is a normal, if slightly hysterical, wife in 
her own home, happily stuffing Christmas stockings for her children, chatting 
to her husband who suddenly informs her that he has taken out a contract on her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to a roadside telephone booth in the snow. Rachel, in robe and slippers, 
gets a ride with a stranger, Lloyd, who takes her home to live with him and his 
deaf paraplegic girlfriend (who isn't really deaf and who may be his mother). 
Rachel changes her name, gets a job and life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Christmas Eve, Rachel's husband arrives at the door with a bottle 
of champagne. Within minutes, he and the paraplegic girlfriend (who is clad in 
reindeer horns and a fake red nose) die a horrible death by poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Rachel and Lloyd (comatose and wearing a Santa Claus suit), who are back 
in the car running away to a new life, where they will change their names 
again. Lloyd will refuse to take off the Santa Claus suit or stop drinking 
champagne until the next Christmas, when he dies too. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel is on the road again, and we follow her through several more bizarre 
Christmases, interspersed with scenes in which she tries to explain to various 
obtuse psychiatrists what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is that it could all be true. Freeman has directed the actors 
to play it straight, as if it were true. This somehow creates a chilling effect 
that activates a seldom used section of our funny bone: We find ourselves 
laughing hysterically when Lloyd finally keels over in his Santa Claus suit; 
then we feel embarrassed when we realize that we are laughing at his death. But 
before we can buffer that, we are whisked off to the next incredible event. 
Nothing comes to rest in itself. Every event calls forth a new horror clothed 
in everyday dress. 
</P>
<P>
The issues become life, death, sanity, recurrence, betrayal, recognition, 
salvation . . . the list is unfinished but it leads further away from mere 
social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The mise-en-scene deserves a paragraph -- the stage is a claustrophobic jumble 
of all the scenery and props needed for 20 scenes. Thus as two characters sit 
on the double bed, they are inches from the red automobile they will drive in 
the next scene. Two hanging video screens record some of the action. The effect 
is disturbing, disorienting, dreamlike and wholly effective. Douglas Tal 
Sanders is scenic and lighting designer. 
</P>
<P>
There are some good performances by Tom Rearden, Peter Alexander Flanders, 
Rachel Marie Bargiel, Even Caston and Aaron Levin. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is an interesting playwright. His "Prelude to a Kiss" is on Broadway and 
was nominated for a Tony Award last year.

<HEAD>James, Elizabeth Most Popular Names for 1989 British Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James and Elizabeth, the names of British kings
and queens, were the most popular names for babies born in 1989,
according to the social editor of the Times of London newspaper.
   Of the 2,780 boys whose births were announced in the newspaper
last year, 392 had James as one of their names, 120 ahead of the
runner-up, William, said social editor Helen Beard.
   Of the 2,645 birth announcements for girls, 254 had Elizabeth
among their names, 106 ahead of the second most popular choice,
Charlotte, she said.
   Of the first names chosen, James was also the most popular for
boys, as it has been every year since 1964, Ms. Beard wrote in her
annual letter to the editor outlining parents' selections. James
was followed by Thomas, William, Alexander, Edward, Charles,
Oliver, George, Robert and Henry.
   Elizabeth was only the 10th most popular choice as a first name
for girls, the newspaper reported. Charlotte was the top choice, a
position acquired in 1983 but surrendered to Emma and Alice in 1987
and 1988 respectively.
   Charlotte was followed by Emily, Sophie, Emma, Alice, Olivia,
Alexandra, Katherine, Lucy and then Elizabeth.
   Britain has had two queens named Elizabeth, including the
current monarch, Elizabeth II, and two King James. William, Edward,
Charles, George, Henry, Charlotte, Alice and Alexandra are also
names associated with the royal family past and present.

the receipts have been tabulated and the winners are: the Grateful Dead, the

<TEXT>     The old geezers in the Dead topped the national mid-year revenue totals
with $22.6 million. Dominating the local concert scene, the 21-city, nine-act
Lollapalooza tour -- headlined by Jane's Addiction -- and the KMEL Summer Jam
rap/dance spectacular sold out two shows apiece at Mountain View's Shoreline
Amphitheatre.;   But these few successes were eclipsed by the stunning decline
in the business itself. The Fresno-based concert business publication Pollstar
listed mid-year revenues for the Top 100 shows at $76 million, down by 30
percent from the record $110 million of 1990.;   One of the most highly touted
tours at the start of the pop summer season was one that included the Sisters
of Mercy, Public Enemy and Gang of Four. But when the West Coast leg of that
tour was canceled because of poor ticket sales, its title, "The Tune In, Turn
On, Burn Out Tour," came to symbolize the state of the rock concert business.
In 1991, the fans did tune in and turn on, but they didn't turn out in the
record-smashing numbers of the past.;   Other touring "festivals" of the
season didn't fare much better. Operation Rock And Roll (Judas Priest, Alice
Cooper, Motorhead, Metal Church and Dangerous Toys) drew barely 5,500 fans to
the 20,000-seat Shoreline Amphitheatre in July (in 1990, Judas Priest drew
13,000 fans to a show in Oakland) and did the same poor business in other
parts of the country. And the nostalgia-infused Gathering of the Tribes II,
with nine acts including Fishbone and Primus, drew 7,000 to Shoreline; its
tour was canceled after three shows.;   David Lee Roth, who had sold out the
Cow Palace in Daly City in past years, was forced to cancel his summer tour
because of disappointing ticket receipts.;   And while the Guns N' Roses tour
has done well in many venues (the group sold out its two-night stand at
Shoreline), it hasn't done sellout business in several of the cities where two
shows were scheduled -- a major disappointment given the group's stature in
the scene.;   Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni cites several factors in the
poor showing of various tours and venues: the recession; competition from
other forms of entertainment; and a continuing trend of escalating ticket
prices.;   "This is the first time that a recession has adversely affected the
business," he says. "And with fewer entertainment dollars out there, these
shows have had to compete with movies like 'Terminator 2' and with places like
Great America and with activities like going to the beach. It's been a rough
year.";   He also notes that for the first time the business has seen
"resistance on the part of the fans to escalating prices" of tickets, which
have gone up 20 percent from 1990.;   The Bay Area has suffered a decline in
business (although it hasn't been affected as much as other parts of the
country, particularly the Northeast and Midwest).;   Promoter Bill Graham,
whose Bill Graham Presents books Shoreline Amphitheatre, said business at that
venue was off approximately 10 percent to 15 percent so far this year. "But
while our business hasn't been as good as in previous years it wasn't that
bad. We're like a baseball player who usually hits .400 and is now hitting
.350 this season.";   While Graham also blames the recession, he said there
haven't been as many shows on the touring circuit. "In 1990 we did 58 shows at
Shoreline," he said, "but this year we did 45.";   Given the decline in the
concert business, many groups were reluctant to tour during the usually prime
summer season. Acts such as Queen and R.E.M. released new records (R.E.M.'s
"Out of Time" was No. 1 on the charts at one point) but declined to tour. And
acts such as Dire Straits and New Kids on the Block postponed tours they had
initially scheduled for the summer because of the dreary commercial climate.; 
 The absence of the stadium tours by the usual blockbuster names was also
partly to blame for the season's poor showing. In past years, seasonal
revenues have been bolstered by the stadium tours of such acts as U2, Bruce
Springsteen and Paul McCartney. But this season the only consistent stadium
draw was the Grateful Dead, which averaged approximately 47,000 tickets per
show. (Those bewhiskered galoots of ZZ Top, who had the second-highest
grossing tour at mid-year with revenues of $18.5 million, did divert from
their arena tour to play a sold-out show at Spartan Stadium in San Jose Aug.
10.);   But if the blockbuster acts haven't been present in this summer pop
season, blockbuster ticket prices have. Graham says the responsibility for
that resides with the artists.;   "One of the misconceptions on the part of
the fans," Graham says, "is that it is the promoter who establishes the prices
of tickets. But those are predicated by the amount that the acts are charging.
If an act decides to charge, hypothetically, $200,000 (to perform), I have to
adjust what we are charging for tickets. Any time that an act is willing to
play for less, I will charge less.";   Is he saying the acts are greedy?;  
"When it comes to the ticket prices," Graham said, "the superstars could care
less" about the fans.;   But with fans resisting those prices, Graham thinks
there could be an upside to all of this. "I think the poor showings of these
tours might force them to rethink what they will charge.";   A few of the
tours, such as the one that came with Damn Yankees and Bad Company, lowered
their ticket prices and, Pollstar reports, ended up making as much money as
other tours while performing to vastly greater numbers of fans. And with one
of the primary roles of tours being record promotion, that arguably translates
to wiser  career enhancement. (But even that did not work out for Roth, who
lowered the ticket prices to $9 for lawn seats at his various "shed" shows.); 
 "It's been a wacky year," Bongiovanni says. "But the business is cyclical and
it looks as if the latter part of the year and the next year should improve.";
  At this point, demand for tickets for a tour by the consistently
best-selling Van Halen (which comes to the Bay Area Sept. 13-14) has been
relatively heavy. And other acts that are set to begin tours include Tom
Petty, Prince, Paula Abdul, Luther Vandross, Bob Seger and Metallica. And
there is speculation that U2 and Springsteen could be touring in 1992.;   But
at the moment, until these heavy-hitters hit the circuit, all the business can
do is tend its wounds and hope that the recession and its woes will go away.

<DESCRIPT>  TELEVISION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE love that illuminates "Wildflower," a hauntingly beautiful movie on
cable's Lifetime channel Tuesday at 9 p.m., flows through it like sunlight
through stained glass.;   The tale, set in rural Depression-era Georgia and
directed by actress Diane Keaton, has the timelessness of a parable. It's
almost biblical in its simplicity.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DIANE KEATON'S LATEST STARRING ROLE: DIRECTOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Patricia Arquette stars as a beautiful, neglected 17-year-old girl
imprisoned by her wicked stepfather because she is "touched by the devil" --
deaf and epileptic.;   Reese Witherspoon plays 13-year-old Ellie Perkins, a
neighbor who discovers the grimy, half-wild girl locked away in a chicken
coop. She is unwashed, illiterate, and barely capable of speech.;   Ellie and
her 18-year-old brother, Sammy (William McNamara), befriend Alice, against the
vehement wishes of their father, Jack (Beau Bridges, in a masterly
performance), a widower still locked in his grief.;   They help Alice emerge
from her ignorance and isolation, and when conflict looms with Alice's father,
papa Jack is forced out of his own emotional isolation.;   At the same time,
young Sammy realizes that his unsophisticated friend is rapidly becoming a
beautiful woman, and he doesn't quite know what to make of his feelings.;  
Sara Flanigan's script, based on her books, treats these kinds of love with
great feeling and without a trace of greeting-card sentimentality.;   Here is
the unselfish love of humankind; here is redemptive love; here is familial
love (as well as its cancerous absence); and here, happily and unhappily, is
the love of a man and a woman.;   Arquette's portrayal of a profoundly
hearing-impaired girl is utterly believable. According to production notes,
she researched the role by listening to speech tapes of hearing-impaired
children before and after cochlear implants. She also worked with a speech
therapist, and was coached by a girl who has a hearing loss similar to
Alice's.;   "Wildflower" is a superb movie, a fully realized, sophisticated
piece of film-making. But try telling that to its director, and you can
practically hear her blush over the telephone.;   Although the movie is billed
as director Keaton's first dramatic feature, she demurred at calling
"Wildflower" a movie.;   "I don't see it as a film, I see it as a television
show," she said. "You have to plan the whole movie according to these
breaks.";   To ease the transition shock, Keaton designed thematic "bumpers,"
which show Alice's lovely eyes against a background of lush, red wildflowers.;
  She consciously set about saturating the production with green and red
tones.;   "I didn't want to see much blue, because I felt like I wanted to
just sink into this world of green, and being caught up in the woods, and the
romance of that," she said. "I wanted to be hidden under green.";   Keaton,
who has directed a documentary, "Heaven," and episodes of ABC's "China Beach"
and "Twin Peaks," was reluctant to discuss her contribution to the film,
praising her cast and collaborators. "I got lucky on this," she said.;   And
she wants to do more directing.;   "The problem with acting is sitting in a
trailer, and being left to your own devices and thoughts and fantasies and
self-obsessions, and all the things that are terrifying about acting," she
said.;   "With directing it's a different kind of terror. You don't have time
to think about your terror as much. You don't have time to contemplate about
all the horrible accidents of what you're doing.";   "When you're acting, it's
an interior adventure that's about feelings and anticipations. And I kind of
am more afraid of that, in a strange way," she said. "In terms of using my
feelings and my emotional life, I really feel like acting is, in a way,
harder."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ELDERLY; WOMEN; TRIP; MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT'S the start of a thousand typical movies. A bus with eight women breaks
down in the middle of the woods. Night is falling. There's only a deserted
house for shelter. Is this a chain-saw I see before me?;   But "Strangers in
Good Company" (playing at the Towne, through Thursday) isn't a typical movie.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THERE'S GOOD COMPANY ON THIS WAYWARD BUS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MOVIES; REVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For one thing, the average age of the stranded passengers is about 70. For
another, the closest thing to violence is the barbecuing of a couple of fish.
And the only scene remotely resembling nudity comes when three of the women
take off their shoes and wade in a pond.;   "Strangers in Good Company" isn't
a horror film, or even a Hollywood movie. It's a Canadian character study of
seven passengers and their young bus driver, who have to flee a wayward bus in
search of aid. Along the way they find themselves, and help each other.;  
There are a few moments of humor, some singing, and practical information on
fixing bus engines with emery boards and catching fish with pantyhose. Mostly
there's talk.;   And talk. And more talk, broken only by periods of
introspection. Those who sat stunned through "The Whales of August" may have a
strange feeling of deja vu as one old woman after another looks off across a
misty body of water and sighs. Others may want to storm the screen by the end
and help these people fix their bus. Please, somebody -- get them home so we
can go home.;   But if you can slow yourself down to the film's pace, there
are other charms. The movie is full of overlapping dialogue and casually
observed moments. It plays a little like a documentary. And in a way, it is.; 
 Director Cynthia Scott decided to let the women in the film -- all non-actors
-- use their own first names and tell bits of their own stories. The
photographs intercut through their monologues are pictures of them. And
although there was a script, the pains and memories they reveal are theirs,
too.;   Knowing that going into the film makes it more powerful. Seeing it
unprepared, the movie seems a little contrived and politically correct. One
woman (Alice Diablo) is a Mohawk Indian, the bus driver (Michelle Sweeney) is
black, another passenger (Catherine Roche) is a nun. It's a little like the
Rainbow Coalition on a day trip.;   But once you realize the fact behind the
fiction, the film begins to work. Beth Webber, who confesses to a frail vanity
about the lines in her neck, really does worry about looking old. Mary Meigs,
who talks of her once-secret life as a lesbian, did come out of the closet at
age 60. These aren't just characters; they're real people, and the movie is an
artful kind of eavesdropping.;   Moreover, the film has a pointed message:
Growing old doesn't mean giving up. These women are involved, political,
funny, bawdy. And although they talk about men, they're not dependent on them.
They're perfectly able to take care of themselves, even in their 80s, even
stranded in the woods.;   "We're alive," they shout at one moment in unison.
"We're alive." And it isn't so much a call for help as it is a simple,
triumphant statement.; Strangers in Good Company; (star)(star)(star); Rated:
PG; Cast: Alice Diablo, Mary Meigs, Catherine Roche, Michelle Sweeney;

'ALICE' A FEMINIST REVUE WITHOUT THE OUTRAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, no! Not another feminist revue, Alice! Please say it isn't so! 
</P>
<P>
That might be one's first reaction to the nomenclature -- "feminist revue" -- 
but "A . . . My Name Is Alice," which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage, is more winning than its English primer title. 
</P>
<P>
It has class and a decidedly optimistic (if slightly diffused) point of view, 
delivered by a sum total of 28 savvy contributors (from Amanda McBroom to Steve 
Tesich) and a director who understands the value of restraint (Julianne Boyd). 
</P>
<P>
Boyd and film maker Joan Micklin Silver ("Crossing Delancey") originally 
conceived of "Alice" as a response to the more militant feminist outbursts of 
the angrier 1960s. They took their time to collect their material and pare the 
show down to size, assembling and disassembling this collage of songs and 
scenes, until they had it the way they wanted it. That was 1983. In its present 
form, "Alice" is about many aspects of being female -- good and bad -- in a 
world populated by men and other creatures, all given their due. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't gripe. 
</P>
<P>
Au contraire. Upbeat is the name of this game. If "Alice" can be chided for 
anything, it would be for managing to remain inoffensive. It has its occasional 
cliches (yet another sketch or two set in the confessional of the beauty 
parlor) and its sentimental indulgences (as in a daughter's song to the mother 
she feels she has failed, or the sisters who learn to appreciate one another 
rather late in life). But these are bracketed by enough bracing self-mockery, 
good humor, keen observation and plain fun to serve as appropriate and even 
welcome pace-changers. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the show's success rests with the five performers in charge: the 
quizzical Roo Brown, brash young Rozz Morehead, hip Susan Mosher, elegant 
Michele Pawk and big-voiced and big-hearted Avery Sommers. Each is distinct, 
talented and unstereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
At about two hours with an intermission, the performers riff through "Alice," 
moving with ease from the wistful ("At My Age," wherein an inexperienced 
18-year-old and a widow-of-a-certain-age share counterpoint tribulations about 
the trials of blind dates) to the sly ("I Like the Boys," says Morehead in a 
celebration of the gentler, kinder elements in the opposite sex), to the 
out-and-out parodies of a kindergarten teacher-parent conference (Brown and 
Pawk) and a macho all-female basketball team ("Good Sports"). 
</P>
<P>
The Act One finale, "Bluer Than You," is an artful lesson in how to top the 
other person at feeling sorry for yourself ("My man called me such terrible 
names . . ." -- "Your Man speaks to you?" or "When I get up in the morning . . 
. " -- "You can get up in the morning?"). 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like this, with the second half serving up more of the same and 
hitting such familiar locales as a male strip joint ("Pretty Young Men") and 
the inevitable psychiatric clinic ("Honeypot," raised a couple of notches by 
Sommers' joyously sexual performance). Along the way we go through the 
seemingly unrelated but amusing vamping of a German-born French chanteuse 
(Pawk) and Morehead's rousing declaration of independence when she tells her 
decamping boy-friend that parting as enemies beats the dickens out of parting 
as friends. 
</P>
<P>
A delectable leitmotif that repeats throughout the evening is the reading of 
poems by Brown "from my collection, 'For Women Only.' " The poems change, but 
their hilarious awfulness doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Faulkner has designed a simple platform set, simply lit by John B. 
Forbes. But "Alice" is not about settings or costumes (by Shigeru Yaji). It is 
about lampooning at its merriest and mildest. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice" lacks the outrage satire requires. And even though the show is only six 
years old, its targets are beginning to feel worn. They were predictable to 
start with and have since been hit by others. What this production has going 
for it chiefly is quality -- in the performers and in the distinction of the 
individual sketches. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Alice" is everything that the long-running "Six Women With 
Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know" aspires to be but isn't. You can't 
rise much above written material any more than you can sink too far below it. 
Saturday night's spontaneous ovation for "Alice" partially at least attests to 
that. A final word of commendation: Musicians James Raitt and Gary Scott are 
terrific. 
</P>

Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 7 p.m., with 
matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2. Until June 11. Tickets: $20.50-27.50;

   There comes across the American cultural
landscape once in a while someone who enhances life on a grand
scale. These are the builders of a Lincoln Center, a Kennedy
Center, a Music Center of Los Angeles and more. They are many
spirits and this is the story of one of them _ Alice Tully.

<TEXT>
   She is an American Muse, like her sisters in
Greek mythology, a patron of the arts.
   Here in America, the Muse is not mythic. Here feminine largess
has created museums, art galleries, ballets, orchestras and concert
halls that enrich the nation's cultural life.
   In this tradition is Alice Tully. And she at 87, in all modesty,
is hopeful there are more. There already are many.
   Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center is home to chamber music and
to the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped
found. Today she is only an interested bystander, but her heart is
in it everyday.
   Her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln
Center, suggested she pay most of the costs of a small concert hall
to be built at the center.
   ``When he asked, I had the most wonderful feeling,'' she
recalls. ``And I just knew this is for me. I said, `Oh, Arthur, I
can't think of anything I'd rather do.' I was overjoyed.
   ``On very important occasions, that voice inside of me tells me
things. And I heard inside of me, `Well, this is what you came to
do.'''
   The honor role of American Muses is long.
   In New York, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney founded the Whitney
Museum in 1930 to house American art.
   Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Sullivan and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
founded the Museum of Modern Art in 1929.
   Jane Wrightsman, Lila Acheson Wallace, Brooke Astor and Joan
Payson have contributed hugely to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Blanchette Rockefeller gave one-third of her American art
collection to the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco.
   Eleanor Belmont, by starting the Metropolitan Opera Guild, got
that opera house through the Depression. Lucia Chase for years used
her fortune to support the American Ballet Theater.
   Anne Bass, Nancy Zeckendorf and LuEsther Mertz donate to ballet.
Martha Hyder of Fort Worth aids the Van Cliburn Competition.
   There are builders of concert halls. The Filene Center at Wolf
Trap near Washington was built by Jouett Shouse with money from
that department store fortune.
   Buffy Chandler donated and raised money for the 25-year-old
Music Center of Los Angeles, for which Lillian Disney recently
donated $50 million to build Walt Disney Hall.
   Louise Davies gave the San Francisco Symphony's hall. Frances
Pew Hayes paid for the symphony's new hall in Naples, Fla. Patricia
Corbett, with money from door chimes, is a music philanthropist in
Cincinnati. The University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of
Music has Corbett Auditorium and Patricia Corbett Theater and at
the top of the Cincinnati Symphony's Music Hall is a ballroom named
Corbett Tower.
   Miss Tully is the granddaughter of Amory Houghton Jr., the
founder of Corning Glass. Her career was as a concert singer.
   ``My mother wasn't interested in the arts per se,'' she recalls.
``My parents never expected to have an artist in the family. But
they were very kind when they realized that I just wanted to sing,
and that was it, and that I was only too anxious to work. And so
they let me do it. That was wonderful, that they let me go and live
and study in Paris. At that time (1923) it was not the usual
thing.''
   She hasn't been a philanthropist all her life. ``I didn't have
anything to give until after my mother died,'' she says. ``I always
wished that I could because I was always so interested in that
world.''
   She knew how artists struggled. ``I had friends who were
painters and sculptors and singers and composers. They all needed
money.''
   Miss Tully, by nature a person of dignity, reserve and gracious
charm, was talked into allowing Alice Tully Hall to be named for
her for by John D. Rockefeller III. ``I would have liked it better
being anonymous. Absolutely. It took me six months to make up my
mind to give my name to the hall because I knew what would happen.
And it did.''
   Within a week, she says, requests for donations poured in. ``Now
it's worse than ever. When I came back on Monday, there was a stack
of mail like that.'' She gestures high above a table. ``And I had
taken out a stack like that when I went off on the weekend. I sit
up late at night opening mail.
   ``In the arts, the need is greater than ever. Expenses go up so
steadily. And of course that wonderful fantasy world of opera where
we can lose ourselves is the most expensive of all. It is so
wonderful and I have loved it since I was a child. I love all forms
of art.''
   Now she pours tea from violet-sprigged china in the living room
of her Manhattan apartment, with its moss-green carpet and
draperies and bleached-oak paneling. Flowering plants are placed on
occasional tables and windowsills. Her two pet Maltese dogs, Sophie
and Tati, scamper in to bark hello.
   That is present tense. Past tense she can remember the lunch
when she first heard of the Lincoln Center project, a year before
President Eisenhower turned the first spadeful of earth and gave
the signal to start the steam shovels, June 1959.
   She was not just a philanthropist. Alice Tully Hall, which opens
on the street, is tucked into a corner of the Juilliard School.
Miss Tully objected when Juilliard wanted to make it part of the
school. ``I had, above all, to stand my ground, which I did.''
   It took her three years of insistence to get the wide space
between the chamber hall rows. She has more letters over the last
20 years thanking her for the comfort than she has received about
the fine acoustics.
   Arthur Houghton also suggested to Gian-Carlo Menotti that he
call on his cousin when the composer was looking for money to start
a summer music festival in Spoleto, Italy. Miss Tully has been a
supporter ever since. In January, a benefit to repair hurricane
damage at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., was held
at Alice Tully Hall, with Miss Tully attending.
   Some have referred to Miss Tully as a grande dame of arts
philanthropy. But that is not how she thinks of herself.
   ``I just do what I like to do, what I think I have to do and
what it is my privilege to do.''

   Alice, the 8-foot boa constrictor, hasn't
been home since last weekend and neighbors are wondering _ is Alice
getting hungry?
   Alice normally eats once a week and it's been that long since
the male snake's last meal, a rat, said Deputy Police Chief Richard
Faulkner.
   ``You know what it's going to do out there. It's going to
grow,'' said Carole Stevens, whose cat is locked inside until Alice
turns up.
   Alice got loose after a friend of its owner took it outside last
Saturday, police said. The friend fell asleep and Alice slithered
away.
   ``I saw these two people outside looking in my trees. I thought
maybe they lost a bird,'' said Stevens, who lives near snake owner
Linda Pyorala in the Country Cousin Mobile Home Village. When
Stevens learned Alice was missing, she called police.
   Pyorala declined to comment about her missing boa.

<HEAD>Golden Years Dimmed by Abuse for Many Elderly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA METZLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator.
   She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years weighing heavy
_ less for the age and a bad hip, more for her 52-year-old son who
was waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street
Alice headed for a neighbor's phone to tell the police her son had
turned abusive again.
   ``You work and support a child all your life,'' she said from
New York City, where she lives. ``Then they act like they hate
you.''
   Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million
elderly people may be abused, researchers say, often by children,
grandchildren, even great-grandchildren _ the very people they
depend on for care in their old age.
   ``This happens with these blood relatives _ sons, daughters,
nieces, nephews,'' said Dorothy Brodie, a 75-year-old retired
social worker who works with the Bronx Elder Abuse Support Projsaid Elizabeth
Holtzman, District Attorney of the New York borough of Brooklyn,
where elder abuse has risen 400 percent since 1986 to 370 cases
last year. She attributes the increase to abusers' use of crack
cocaine.
   Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported
nationwide, an increase of 10 percent from 1987, said Toshio
Tatara, director of the National Aging Resource Center on Elder
Abuse in Washington, D.C. ``People still find it incredible that we
abuse our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years
ago. And we're doing it like a national pastime.''
   Tatara believes just one in 14 cases is likely to be reported.
   The victim usually is 75 or older, a woman and generally
dependent, the abuser a son or daughter, the congressional report
found.
   Lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old South Carolina woman whose
daughter kept her in a room so cold the urine in a catheter froze;
a 75-year-old retired nurse from Massachusetts whose 42-year-old
son attacked him with a hatchet; a San Francisco woman whose
$167,000 estate was whittled to $3,000 by a son-in-law.
   ``These cases are really difficult and scary even to experienced
social workers,'' said Lucy Friedman, director of the Victim
Services Agency in New York, which helped Alice seek a temporary
restraining order against her son.
   ``I was really afraid of him,'' said Alice, who bears a scar on
her neck where her son once sliced her. ``Once he gets the wine, he
goes crazy.''
   The abusers many times have their own problems: drug and alcohol
abuse, unemployment, money, mental illness. Violence may be
repayment for abuse a son or daughter received. A cramped house may
spark it; middle-aged children free at last of their own children
may resent the intrusion of a frail parent. In some cases, it's the
stress of caring for an elderly parent.
   Paramedics answering a call in the Los Angeles suburb of San
Fernando found 77-year-old Virginia Grimes Jeter covered with
excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died five hours
later.
   The woman's daughter, Cynthia Jeter Green, 39, had promised her
mother not to put her in an old folks' home, said Prosecutor Lee
Harris. A probation report found Ms. Green ``was under a degree of
emotional distress.''
   She pleaded no contest April 12 to elder abuse and was ordered
to begin psychiatric counseling and perform 300 hours of community
service. She did not return several calls requesting an interview.
   ``The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to
put their loved ones in a nursing home or feel they have to be
responsible for total care is fairly common in these cases,'' said
Rosalie Wolf, associate director of the University Center on Aging
at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
   Part of the solution is getting seniors to take responsibility
for stopping and even preventing abuse, said Lee Pearson, assistant
manager of criminal justice services for the American Association
of Retired Persons.
   The elderly should keep regular appointments and stay in touch
with old friends, especially if they move in with a relative,
Pearson said. They should have someone stop by once a week to make
sure all is well.
   New York's Victim Services Agency offers a 24-hour hotline,
individual and group counseling and help in court, getting locks
changed, and finding shelter, transportation and clothing. In a
Bronx group called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what
has happened to them and try to make sense of it.
   ``People just believe and hope so much that this will be the
last time, things will change, he won't do it again. But they do,''
said Diana Walcott, director of the Bronx Elder Abuse Support
Project and leader of Safe Place.
   In many cases, the parents blame themselves, Ms. Friedman said.
``They say `Well, how did I bring up this monster?'''
   Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have statutes
requiring reporting of elder abuse, but those involved with the
cases say the nation has a long way to go toward recognizing the
problem.
   The states spend an average $22 per abused child, but just $2.90
for each abused older person, Congress found. Its report
recommended emergency shelters, tax credits for families caring for
older adults, amendments to Medicare and Medicaid eliminating
limitations on benefits and services to elderly people cared for by
family members at home, and mandatory reporting of abuse.
   ``It's so foreign to our thinking,'' said Ms. Holtzman.
``Doctors won't even ask if abuse has taken place. It's possible
the person, once cured, will be sent back to the same environment,
possibly to be killed.''

POP BEAT / SOUND &amp; VISION: PLAYBOY'S 'HOT ROCKS': NOT-READY-FOR-MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you thought MTV was sexist, brace yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The Playboy Channel has stepped forward with a show that makes MTV look almost 
prudish. It's "Playboy's Hot Rocks" -- a new, hourlong program spotlighting 
uncensored, not-ready-for-MTV music videos, complete with partial or 
full-frontal nudity, as seen usually only over on that naughty continent of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bee Gees, for example, got plenty of publicity on "Entertainment Tonight" 
recently by feigning surprise that their steamy "Body Guard" video had been 
turned down for airplay on MTV, VH-1 and other Victorian outlets. 
</P>
<P>
But the curious can catch that clip and others like it on "Hot Rocks," complete 
with titillating comments between songs from the va-va-voom veejay, Miss March, 
Deborah Driggs. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere, which aired several times this month, also includes uncensored 
Quincy Jones, Alice Cooper and 2 Live Crew; a look at musical sex-meister Barry 
White; and an "exclusive" interview with male-bimbo rocker Tim Karr. Scheduled 
guests for the second episode, airing June 2: the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Playboy Channel can clearly get more explicit in what it shows, the 
pervasive attitude in many of the rap and rock videos routinely shown on MTV 
differs little. This month's edition of Sound &amp; Vision -- where current pop 
clips are rated on a 0-100 scale -- takes a voyeuristic peek into the pop video 
bedroom, and finds only one "adult"-themed clip that also has an adult point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
VID PICK OF THE MONTH: 
</P>
<P>
The The's "Kingdom of Rain." (Director: Tim Pope.) Like several other clips in 
this lot, "Rain" sports a bewigged blond woman in a bedroom, but there's a 
universe of difference in how it moodily delineates the complexities of emotion 
in a long-standing, free-falling love affair. While Angst-ridden singer Matt 
Johnson gazes into his well-furnished fish tank, his neglected lover sits at 
his feet, making faces that disturbingly alternate between fake-seductiveness 
and all-out rage. Remarkably rich and potently cinematic, this video -- which 
has been airing for many months -- is notable now for another reason: Johnson's 
unseen duet partner, representing the female point of view, is the 
suddenly-a-superstar Sinead O'Connor. 93 
</P>
<P>
GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
Billy Idol's "Cradle of Love." (D: David Fincher.) An all-out reverse rape 
fantasy. Shy guy gets mauled by gorgeous woman crawling around on all fours 
(shades of the devil-doll in "Trilogy of Terror"!); after she's had her way 
with him, her real date for the evening knocks on the door. 18 
</P>
<P>
Heart's "All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You." (D: Andy Morahan.) Yet another 
insatiable woman courteously picks up a pretty-boy hitchhiker (which decade is 
this?) and takes him to a motel for one night of sin. Ann Wilson as the distaff 
Brando in a "Last Tango" reversal? Hardly. Danger disregarded, this is played 
up for all the phony romanticism it's worth. (By the way, yes, they're still 
electronically "squeezing" poor Wilson into a size 9.) 7 
</P>
<P>
Alice Cooper's "Poison (uncensored)." (D: Nigel Dick.) On MTV you get bondage 
and death by poisoning; on the Playboy Channel you get all that and breasts 
too. But never in the same takes as the women's pouty faces. This suggests 
different models were used for the body shots, but it's indicative of the 
extent to which guys like Cooper separate women's heads from their torsos. 5 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew's "Me So Horny." (D: Tass Sheik.) Him so sexist. Luke Skyywalker -- 
er, Luther Campbell -- is "a dog in heat," and to prove it, he lifts his leg as 
if to urinate on the camera and, by extension, us. Self-satisfied as a recently 
relieved cocker spaniel, Campbell reclines in bed, reminding a young woman (who 
looks appropriately depressed) that he made her the sex-toy she is today. He 
also mocks her parents' naivete and boasts that he'll soon dump her. Obscenity 
trials aside, any man who could invest so much braggadocio in the using and 
discarding of women is already in a jail -- of his own making. 0

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Colors'' and ``White Mischief''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``COLORS''
   
   ``Colors'' marks the return of Dennis Hopper to directing, and
that should have been news in itself.
   His 1969 ``Easy Rider'' changed the face of the Hollywood film
industry forever, then Hopper fell from grace. After two decades of
drugs and booze, he turned his life around and returned as an actor
of remarkable depth.
   Reportedly the insistence of Sean Penn resulted in Hopper's
chance to direct again. A good thing. ``Colors'' reveals Hopper as
a filmmaker of great skill, though a glimmer remains of the
indulgences that contributed to his downfall.
   As a director of action, Hopper is superlative. Just when you
think you had seen every kind of car chase, he provides one through
the streets and back alleys of Los Angeles that is truly
breathtaking. And a fugitive's rampage through a crowded
restaurant, pursued by Penn, is a kinetic wonder.
   On the downside, Hopper betrays his existential tendencies,
staging confrontational scenes that have no real motivation or
payoff. This partly may be due to Michael Schiffer's rather
formless script.
   Penn and Duvall are unlikely partners on the gang war scene.
Duvall is nearing retirement, a cool head who tries to establish a
rapport with gang members. Penn is hotheaded and himself prone to
violence. Both try to act as U.N. peacemakers in the growing war
between the ``Bloods'' and the ``Cripps.''
   ``Colors'' manages to portray the gang members as human beings
not senseless criminals. Penn, who may be the Brando of his
generation, continues his string of impressive performances, and
Duvall performs with his usual authority. Maria Conchita Alonso is
wasted as the obligatory love interest.
   The Orion release was produced by Robert H. Solo and scored with
fine, thumping style by Herbie Hancock. The R rating is well
deserved because of the street language, violence, nudity and sex
scenes. Running time: 2 hours.

   ``WHITE MISCHIEF''
   
   While Europe broiled with the ravages of World War II, British
colonists frolicked at Happy Valley near Nairobi, Kenya. The war
for them was a distant thunder: Theirs was a life of sex, drugs and
endless perversions _ mirroring the downside and downfall of the
British Empire.
   Michael Radford captures that aristocratic decadence in Columbia
Picture's ``White Mischief,'' a Nelson Entertainment and Goldcrest
release, starring Sarah Miles, Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi.
   The arrogant and carefree Earl of Erroll (Dance) leads the pack
in a round of parties, costume balls, group sex, club romps, polo
matches and horse races. He has had affairs with every white woman
in the area and possibly some black African women as well.
   Into his seedy sphere steps the ever-so-straight Sir Jock Delves
Broughton (Joss Ackland), a reserved 57-year-old, and his sensual
27-year-old bride, Diana (Scacchi). With one smoldering glance,
Erroll and Diana soon find their way to bed and a tumultuous affair
that leads to his murder.
   Jock is put on trial for the homicide and acquitted. But in the
aftermath, his colder, more vicious side is revealed, and the Happy
Valley community realizes its last gasp.
   One would think that decadence and death would be good fodder
for a fast-paced flick. But ``White Mischief'' is like a
puritanical stripteaser: It promises more than it delivers.
   Still, there are some outstanding performances and delicious
dialogue, especially from Sarah Miles as the kinky Alice de Janze.
Alice, who bed hops with the best of them, is said to have murdered
her first husband. During the trial reference is made to this,
without naming her. Later, reporters ask Alice if she's the woman
in question. Her response: ``Which one?'' The woman who killed her
husband, the reporter says. ``Which one?'' she deadpans.
   Her straight-faced equal is John Hurt, who has a much too small
role as the rancher who also sets his sights on Diana.
   Ackland's cuckolded Broughton is perfect in his restraint.
Dance, however, seems almost miscast: He is not a looker nor
particularly sensual. But he makes his character full of
indifference with unbridled decadence, and that is the mood we are
to feel throughout.
   There is excellent photography by Roger Deakins of the splendid
Kenyan landscape, and spritely costuming by Marit Allen.
   The Michael White-Umbrella Films Production runs 100 minutes and
is rated R for language, drug use and adult themes.

ONE FAMILY THAT'S A FLOCK OF FUN;

As "To the Birdhouse" opens, Alice Brody is a happy woman. She has just married 
Peter Eiger, a rare bird of solitary habits who makes his living doing baseball 
statistics. Alice's brother, young Willie, is still in his bachelor stage, 
about midway through a string of ethnically variegated girlfriends, the current 
one a Japanese sociologist named Yuki. Alice's father has flown from the family 
nest and married again, but the rest of the relatives -- Alice's relentlessly 
eccentric grandma and an assortment of aunts and great-aunts -- make up a 
friendly, nurturing flock. 
</P>
<P>
Only Brenda, Alice's mother, seems unhappy. A kind and beautiful dove, she has 
somehow gotten mixed up with Louie Scifo, a kind of immigrant Italian carrion 
crow. Louie deals in stolen goods and secondhand furniture. He wears gabardine 
leisure suits and butts in where he's not wanted. He's an embarrassment, a 
disaster, and although Alice -- as a newly married woman -- wishes domestic 
contentment on everyone she knows, she draws the line at Louie. He's a curse. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda soon finds this out for herself. She breaks up with Louie, but he will 
have none of it. His heart (if he has a heart) is broken. In a string of 
bizarre incidents, Louie begins the secondary courtship of the already rejected 
lover: He bashes in Brenda's windows, puts black widow spiders under her 
pillow, makes crank phone calls to her and her extended family at all hours of 
the day and night. Finally, he hauls out his binoculars and begins watching the 
Brody family. Alice can't look out of a window into a tree without seeing a 
ClamberingLouie, his binoculars trained on her. 
</P>
<P>
For Alice, this is particularly disconcerting. She is a bird watcher by trade, 
putting out a newsletter for New York Birders. The morning after her wedding 
night, she rises early to take the subway to Prospect Park, all for the sake of 
a Bullock's Oriole, blown in from the Rockies on the mighty wings of a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Alice's first year of married life, then, is punctuated by typed 
lists of birds she spots: On Sept. 15, at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge: "1. 
2 Pied-Billed Grebes, 2. 14 double-crested cormorants, 3. 2 great blue herons," 
and so on. When Alice is happy, she sees a lot (this particular list runs to 53 
items). When she's sad, or tormented by Louie, she finds only: "1. 67 Cicada 
shells." 
</P>
<P>
By now, the family has moved to Brenda's summer home in Westport, Conn. Louie 
has gotten himself hired as a gardener by the woman next door and runs a power 
mower back and forth across their yard, howling, "Brenda! Brenda!" Things have 
gotten out of hand, and Alice must devise a strategy to drive the Clambering 
Louie out of their collective lives. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this book is not for everyone. You have to buy into the idea that 
all of us are terminally weird and driven by behavior patterns that are best 
described as birdbrained. Ethically, I must disclose my own bias here: This 
review was written on a day when seven California Jays, two pairs of nesting 
doves, one pair of nesting quail, eight house finches, one towhee and one 
red-shafted flicker flew through our patio. (But no Clambering Louies, thank 
God.)

<TEXT>     Cecilia, the heroine of the depression-era "The Purple Rose of Cairo," is a
waitress who breaks two dishes for every one she successfully delivers.
Smacked with regularity by her out-of-work husband, Cecilia is Jell-O when a
handsome fellow wearing a pith helmet, a character inside the movie she's
watching, steps down from the screen and sweeps her out of the small-town
theater.;    "I just met a wonderful man," Cecilia later tells her sister.
"He's fictional, but you can't have everything.";    Sally and Cecilia, who
inhabit universes in which the mundane and the miraculous are inextricably
merged, are just two of the enchanting characters Woody Allen has written and
directed for Mia Farrow since 1982.;    Now it seems as if they've all been
leading up to "Alice," Allen's new comedy about the cockeyed, herb-induced
liberation of a rather solemn, inhibited Central Park West wife and mother.;  
 In the world of movies, where relationships that survive more than two or
three productions are rare, the collaboration of Allen and Farrow is sublimely
eccentric -- and a measure of the personal nature of Allen's cinema and of
Allen and Farrow's relationship. "Alice" is their 11th film together, and it
marks a partnership which is certainly singular and possibly unique.;   
Federico Fellini often collaborated with his wife, Giuletta Masina. At least
one of their films -- "Nights of Cabiria" -- remains a matchless comedy. But
the director's point of view eventually shifted from the beloved to the lover,
and Marcello Mastroianni replaced Masina as his star.;    Farrow has now
appeared in more than half of Allen's movies, but when she entered Allen's
world in "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy," she was in danger of becoming the
screen's most formidable waif.;    There's still a bit of the waif, but now
there's also much, much more.;    In her first Allen film, she plays Ariel
Weymouth, a free spirit with some of the amiable klutziness of Annie Hall
about her. Ariel looks like a golden-haired Botticelli angel, but she has a
reputation as long as your arm.;    In addition to the ambitious Sally and the
incurably romantic Cecilia, three of the more memorable Farrow performances
are the common-sensical psychiatrist, Eudora Fletcher, who successfully treats
the "chameleon man" in "Zelig"; Tina Vitale, the teased-blond doxy in
"Broadway Danny Rose"; and the unexpectedly staunch wife and mother, Hannah,
in "Hannah and Her Sisters.";    Just as Allen has shaped Farrow's career, she
appears to have given direction to his. After her appearance in "A Midsummer
Night's Sex Comedy," there is, among other things, a new sense of community in
his work, of family and children.;    This is most somberly and successfully
expressed in "Hannah and Her Sisters" (which features a stunning performance
by Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow's real-life mother) and most riotously in the
brand-new "Alice.";    One of the most magical things about "Alice" is the way
Allen persuades the audience to accept not only magic but also what seem to be
some deeply felt observations about life. It's a risky moment when Farrow, as
a woman who worries that her children are being brought up with the wrong
values, dashes off to India to work with Mother Teresa. Were the character
less firmly rooted in its own reality, the movie would go sailing out the
window.;    It doesn't. Allen takes Alice Tate seriously. He believes in her
and is able to give conviction to a character who is quite unlike any other in
screen literature.;    "Alice" is a personal triumph for both Allen and
Farrow, in part, at least, because of a fascinating shift in their
professional relationship.;    There had been hints of things to come in
earlier films, particularly in "The Purple Rose of Cairo." The shift is
manifest in "Alice" in the scene in which Alice decides to throw caution to
the wind and have an extramarital affair with Joe (Joe Mantegna), a musician.;
   Sitting on the bed with Joe, Alice is overwhelmed by pre-coital guilt.
She's eager to get on with it, but she talks non-stop to put it off. She says
in desperation that she thinks she might be out of practice. Joe tells her to
relax. "It's not like juggling.";    Gently, he pulls her down on the bed.
With her last words, "I'm going to be going on a diet next week," it's
suddenly clear that Farrow is not only Allen's Masina but also his
Mastroianni.;    In her, the two functions become one. She's both the one
beloved and the one who would love, that is, Allen's stand-in. The
collaboration is complete.;    Alice Tate is her own woman, but she's also
Danny Rose, Zelig, and any number of other Allen roles. She's a sheep in
wolf's clothing.;    Magic.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Music Makers: Arlo Guthrie Keeps Music, Humor Flowing</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secret is out and remember that you heard it
here first: Arlo Guthrie never really wanted to be a folk singer.
   Forget for a moment that he's the son of Woody Guthrie, who
wrote more than 1,000 songs, or that he's written a sizable number
of memorable tunes himself. Forget all those great interpretations
of ``Goodnight Irene,'' ``Amazing Grace,'' ``Stealin''' and ``This
Land Is Your Land'' that you've heard him do over the years. Don't
even think about ``Alice's Restaurant,'' that epic tale of youthful
rebellion and anti-war protest.
   What Arlo Guthrie really wanted to be was a newspaper reporter.
   ``Yeah, there must be a repressed reporter in one of my hidden
personalities because I love to write,'' laughs Guthrie, whose
musical career has seen him evolve from the '60s-kid protest singer
with a sense of humor to one of the pre-eminent voices in American
folk music.
   But he says, ``I didn't become a folk singer because I wanted to
be. I ended up doing this because I didn't know how to do anything
else.
   ``And that hasn't changed much,'' he adds with that quick,
good-natured laugh that his fans have heard so often over the
years. It's the one that sometimes surfaces right on stage, in the
middle of a song, when something strikes him so funny that he has
to stop and tell everyone about it.
   But now the funny stories, the wry asides, the general
observations on the oddities of life are as apt to go down on paper
as over a microphone in a concert hall.
   The ones that are written go into Guthrie's newsletter, The
Rolling Blunder Review, an espistle written in a style that evokes
rollicking images of the kind of old-time journalism chronicled in
such movies as ``The Front Page.''
   But the newsletter never started out to be a newsletter.
   ``It sort of came about by accident,'' Guthrie says.
   In the mid-'70s he began collecting addresses of people who
might want a schedule of his shows, but he never really got around
to sending them one.
   ``People started asking us, `When are you going to send us
something?' They'd say, `I signed up 14 times and I never got
anything,''' he recalled.
   So with a great sense of guilt, The Rolling Blunder Review was
born. Guthrie and his wife, Jackie, typed it on a single sheet of
paper, made copies and mailed it from their home in Washington,
Mass. Early issues contained only the long-sought schedule and a
few funny comments on ``Alice's Restaurant'' and other songs.
   But as word spread, the newsletter grew. Five years later, it's
an eight-page quarterly, containing stories, letters to the editor
and information on how to buy Guthrie's albums, T-shirts and other
merchandise. There's even a cooking column by Alice Brock. (``You
remember Alice. There's a song about Alice.'')
   Some 60,000 to 70,000 people pay $3 a year for it, although it
goes free to people in hospitals and prisons.
   Among the stories in recent issues are reports on concerts to
benefit the environment and in support of student protests in China
and elsewhere. But somehow, almost everything, no matter how
serious, comes out funny. Sort of like an Arlo Guthrie concert.
   He notes that one role of a folk singer is to comment on
political events of the day as his father, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez
and so many others have done.
   ``But it's not the only job, and it may not even be the most
important job,'' he said. ``The most important thing, for me
personally, is maintaining a sense of humor in an often-humorless
world.''
   For Guthrie, the laughs have been frequent. Only he, for
example, could show us (in ``Alice's Restaurant'') how to use a
litterbug arrest as a reason to stay out of the Army during the
Vietnam War. Only he has dared speculate (in ``The Pause of Mr
Claus'') that Santa Claus might enter houses late at night because
he's a dope fiend. Or that a delightful folk ditty about the joys
of tilling the Earth (``The Garden Song'') should be played
backward in search of evil messages.
   The laughs have been so frequent that they've allowed some to
overlook the musical talent. Guthrie is more than proficient on
guitar, piano, harmonica and banjo, as well as a singer of some
range and a writer whose best songs evoke strong images of joy and
sometimes sorrow.
   ``Alice's Restaurant'' started it all in 1967, making him an
overnight star at age 20.
   ``Who could have ever imagined it,'' he says of the way the
youth culture embraced his 18-minute, guitar-accompanied monologue
on how he used a Thanksgiving Day arrest to stay out of the Army.
The song also helped him escape early comparisons with a legendary
father.
   And although Guthrie has almost always included a Woody Guthrie
song or two in his concert repertoire, he downplays the father-son
connection.
   ``For whatever cosmic reasons - and who really understands those
things - I ended up similar to my dad in some ways,'' he says.
``But we're vastly different in other ways.''
   But the connection also brings up another inevitable question.
Woody Guthrie died in 1967 of the debilitating neurological
disorder Huntington's Chorea. It has a 50-50 chance of being passed
from parent to child, it strikes in middle age, and Arlo Guthrie is
43.
   But he dismisses such inquiries good-naturedly. ``I'm not dead
yet,'' he says. ``Does that answer your question?''
   He is also not through working yet, continuing to tour regularly
and making plans to record again after several years without a new
album.
   ``I've written some new songs,'' he says. ``I've got enough for
a totally new record.''
   He's also thinking about an animated version for children of
``Alice's Restaurant,'' which was made into a movie in 1969.
   ``It would focus more on the Thanksgiving part and less on the
littering and draft parts,'' he says.
   He notes that the idea of dumping ``a half a ton of garbage'' by
the side of the road isn't as popular as it once was, even if the
dump was closed on Thanksgiving and you'd ``never heard of a dump
closed on Thanksgiving before.''
   ``Littering isn't such a good idea anymore,'' he says a bit
sheepishly. But then he adds with that quick laugh: ``I sure had a
lot of fun on that day though.'

<TEXT>
And back we go into the nursery, into the place where we now analyse
childhood enchantments in context of disenchanted knowledge of adult life.
Can there be one simple reaction to Alice's Adventures Under Ground,
Christopher Hampton's new adaptation of Lewis Carroll's writings and aspects
of his (ie Charles Dodgson's) life? On the one hand, since this Alice is
full of episodes from those classic books, it is a bracing dip back into a
sane child's discovery of the nonsensical grown-up world. On the other hand,
it is a disturbing study of the stammering, polite, scholarly Dodgson's
melancholy fascination with little girls.
Hampton means, I take it, to examine Carroll's creativity in terms of what
Edmund Wilson called 'the wound and the bow': the wound, in this case, being
Dodgson's paedophile inclinations, the bow being the tales he told to
enthrall his listeners. The wound/bow theory proposes that the spot where
some artists are psychologically vulnerable is precisely what gives them
their archery - their creative genius. In Martha Clarke's staging, there are
only five actors, and the overlap between little Alice Liddell's real world
and the dream world that Dodgson creates for her in the nursery is
considerable.
Hampton's view of Dodgson/Carroll is compassionate - too much so. The bow
only interests him as far as it reveals the wound, and many of the books'
multi-faceted quotations are so placed that we read them in terms of
Dodgson's private feelings. 'Seven and a half] Uncomfortable sort of age. If
you'd asked my advice, you'd have left off at seven.' We also watch Dodgson
start to cry as he slowly unbuttons little Alice's dress.
But Carroll's own mind, for all its pathos, is weak tea beside the
intoxicating concoctions of his tales. Though Alice's Adventures Under
Ground is sensitively shaped, its eventual thrust is merely sentimental. And
sentimentality, surely, is wrong for the man who made Alice cry out 'You're
nothing but a pack of cards]'
At the Cottesloe Theatre, Robert Israel's nursery set is eloquent. One look
at its rocking-horse, its white walls, its large dark looking-glass above
the mantel, and we are prepared for meanings both surreal and psychological.
John Carlisle, Gabrielle Lloyd, and Joseph Mydell play a marvellous range of
supporting roles. Martha Clarke has them act with a fine dash of exaggerated
intensity.
Little Sasha Hanau would be an ideal Alice - grave, focused, precise,
responsive - if she did not gabble rapid lines. Such manners are affecting
in so small a child. Michael Maloney (despite overdoses of vocal virtuosity)
beautifully creates a Carroll/Dodgson of immense courtesy, birdlike staccato
head movements, and eyes both burning and pleading. He is adult among
children, child among adults. Judiciously, Hampton and Clarke have him play
his own Dormouse.
In repertory at the Cottesloe, Theatre, South Bank, into 1995.

   The world's first test-tube tiger cub pounced
and growled during her National Zoo debut Tuesday before settling
down with a big bottle of milk.
   The 20-pound bouncing Bengal is one of a litter of three cubs
produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered
tiger species.
   Mary Alice, the only surviving cub, was born by Caesarean
section April 27.
   ``This is a marvelous step forward for all those cats on the
verge of extinction,'' said Michael Robinson, director of the
National Zoo. ``In 20 years of our lifetime, we have lost three
subspecies of tigers.''
   During a meetings with journalists, Mary Alice fussed and
squirmed until her keeper stuck a milk bottle in her mouth.
   Then, the yellow-and-black cub stood up on her hind legs,
grasped the bottle with her front paws, closed her eyes and sucked
aggressively until her chin was covered with milk.
   Mary Alice is expected to weigh about 300 pounds when she is
fully grown.
   A second yellow-and-black cub died of pneumonia three weeks
after birth, but zoo officials said the death was not related to
the in vitro procedure. The third cub, a white tiger, died shortly
after birth.
   The surrogate mother, Nicole, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger is
from the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb. A male tiger named Chester
provided the sperm that scientists used to fertilize three eggs
taken from two other tigers.
   Mary Alice eventually will be housed at the Omaha zoo.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all but the domestic cat are
threatened or endangered, according to the National Zoo's Center
for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences. That means a
species is either dying out or not reproducing rapidly enough to
survive long-term.
   Since 1969, three subspecies of tigers have become extinct and
the South China tiger is critically endangered, with only 50
remaining in the world.
   There are more tigers in the world's zoos than there are in the
wild _ 31 black-footed cats; 21 sand cats; and 12 pallas cats in
zoos, according to center officials.
   ``Sometimes people use the words `captive' and `research' as
four-letter words,'' said Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha zoo.
   ``This animal's relatives are captive in Siberia and other
countries,'' he said. ``The habitats for many animals are in
isolated enclaves.''
   When tigers' natural habitats are destroyed, they are limited to
a small area, isolated from other tiger species in their home
countries. While kept in a small area, tigers inbreed, not
producing new genetic material, which causes extinction, Simmons
said.
   National Zoo officials said in vitro fertilization helps
conserve rare tiger species by allowing animals that are sexually
incompatible or separated by long distances to reproduce.
   Mary Alice is named after the wife of Ulysses Seal, a major
participant in programs to conserve tigers in zoos, Simmons said.

<HEAD>Alice Faye's Memories of a Bygone Era</HEAD>

   There was a time when Alice Faye was queen of
the 20th Century Fox musicals.
   ``It was great, it was glamorous, it was wonderful. I don't
spend too much time thinking about it, but when I do, it was
lovely. I had so many nice friends, people who were good to me. I
didn't have too many beefs, many complaints,'' she said.
   ``I have great memories _ of the working people. Wonderful stars
like Don Ameche, John Payne, Tyrone Power, Jack Oakie, Jack Haley,
on and on. We had so much fun, we really did. They don't seem to
have that kind of fun today.''
   Now she has produced a book, ``Growing Old, Staying Young''
(E.P. Dutton, $18.95), written with Dick Kleiner. Still a striking
blonde at 75, she also has been spokeswoman for Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals.
   ``I go out every month, almost,'' she says. ``I travel a day, I
rest a day, then I work two days and I come home. It works out real
nice. It's kind of fun; it keeps me active, keeps me involved and
keeps me off the street.''
   Her book contains the message Faye imparts to her audiences,
whom she calls ``young elders.'' The Faye method:
   ``1. Staying active and involved.
   ``2. Eating a well-balanced diet.
   ``3. No smoking, which is tough for a lot of people.
   ``4. Exercising; that's a key: walking, swimming, stretching.
   ``5. Seeing your doctor and talking to him about your problems.
   ``I throw in 6. Please God, have a sense of humor, because it
helps.''
   She enjoys meeting fans who recall her films of the '30s and
'40s. ``All of them have a story to tell you _ they had a baby at
the time I did this movie or I sang that song,'' she said.
   Faye was born Alice Jeanne Leppert, daughter of a New York
police officer. A teen-age beauty who danced in the Capitol Theater
chorus at 14, she eventually made her way to Hollywood.
   For 10 years she starred in a string of popular musicals: ``Sing
Baby Sing,'' ``Stowaway'' (with Shirley Temple) ``On the Avenue,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``Sally, Irene and Mary,'' ``Rose of
Washington Square,'' ``Lillian Russell,'' ``Weekend in Havana'' and
more.
   Faye seldom watches her old movies on television (``I was never
a fan of me''). But she saw one recently that she remembered
fondly, the wonderfully slapstick ``Hollywood Cavalcade'' (1939).
   ``I really enjoyed seeing that one again,'' she said. ``I had
forgotten how funny (Buster) Keaton was. He was a genius who never
got his due in Hollywood.''
   She has less pleasant memories of her relations with studio boss
Darryl Zanuck.
   ``I wanted to do something more mature, but Zanuck didn't see it
that way,'' she said. ``They were making lots of money with
pictures that Betty Grable and myself were doing, all those
musicals. Always it was the same story. We changed costumes and
leading men, and off we'd go and make another one.''
   ``The only chance I had (for a dramatic role) was `Fallen Angel'
(1945). That was a good, meaty part. But when I finally saw it on
the screen, I was on the cutting room floor.''
   Faye was a victim of the big-studio era, when stars were
pigeon-holed. Her musicals were a studio staple, so Zanuck refused
to change the formula until ``Fallen Angel,'' a box-office failure.
Because of Zanuck's cuts, no one will ever know whether Faye could
have succeeded in drama.
   And Faye left. She never went back.
   She and her husband starred for a decade on their top-rated
radio program, ``The Alice Faye-Phil Harris Show.'' She was a
frequent guest on television and returned to Fox for the 1962
musical version of ``State Fair,'' with a score by Rodgers and
Hammerstein. In more recent times, she toured in ``Good News,''
first with John Payne and then with Don Ameche.
   For many years Faye and her husband have lived in Rancho Mirage,
Calif. Harris, 85, often travels to golf tournaments.

stands in a field of fabric spread out on the floor, its mucous-green color
even more poisonous against the ruby-red carpet of the CPA.;    "I feel like

BALLET  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     What she's constructing looks like a tonneau cover for a small aircraft.
However, it's the armor of a large dragon.;    Powered by 13 children, this is
the Jabberwock, namesake of Lewis Carroll's epic poem, "Jabberwocky" -- one of
the core numbers of "The Adventures of Alice," the spring production of San
Jose Dance Theater, which plays this weekend at the CPA.;    Traditionally,
SJDT performs a classical story ballet, such as "Sleeping Beauty," for its
spring season.;    But "Alice" is its most ambitious effort yet: an all-new
production whose costumes and sets were built from the ground up, with a
commissioned score by Santa Clara University composer Henry Mollicone and
original choreography by Jody White, a well-known dance teacher from Fairfax.;
   Most of its $125,000 cost has gone into an elaborate production constructed
by an army of parents.;    Like all San Jose Dance Theater productions, this
is a showcase for young dancers, drawn from schools all over the South Bay.
The goal of the company is to give a professional-quality performing
experience to as many as possible. White says her task has been to create
"choreography that children could do that would not make them nervous.";   
That doesn't mean it's easy. In SJDT's rehearsal space in a renovated
warehouse at Ninth and Taylor streets, 16 preteens rehearse the lobster
quadrille, an intricate figure dance inspired by the courtly minuet. "All
right, ladies, collect your claws," calls the wardrobe assistant.;    Next
door, 17 smaller children march through the drill-team maneuvers of the deck
of cards, learning from rehearsal assistant Kim Gardner how to make sure
they're in a straight line.;    How many children are there in "Alice"? "I
would say about 1,275," says White, whose sharp nose and close-cropped hair
make her look like one of the Keebler cookie elves.;    Actually, there are
120, multiplied about threefold by parents and siblings, and they've given all
their free time to it for months.;    Since the middle of January, White has
come down from Fairfax every Saturday afternoon, and the dancers worked with
her until late evening. She'd stay over to start the Sunday rehearsal at 10:30
a.m. and drive back to Fairfax in the afternoon. During the week, her work was
reinforced by her two rehearsal assistants, Gardner, who has danced with
Margaret Wingrove Dance Company and Oakland Ballet, and Kristin Elliot.;    As
the kids rehearse, their parents and others man the oars of an immense galley,
sewing costumes, constructing masks and props, building sets.;    The music
was composed in long-distance telephone calls. White would call Mollicone and
tell him the plan for each scene, how much music she wanted and what kind.
He'd write, call her back and sing it to her. The kids rehearsed from a
work-tape on which Mollicone played the piano and sang the instrumental solos
and even sound effects such as the sobs of the Mock Turtle.;    The idea for
"Alice" came from SJDT's artistic director, Paul Curtis. " 'Alice' lends
itself to imaginative effects," says White, who conflated "Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass" for the ballet. She and
lighting designer Brad Belleville, for instance, devised a dazzling war for
the chess pieces, all done in strobe lights.;    In translating it into dance,
she tried to select episodes that could be expressed in movement. The ballet
includes such danceable passages as the lobster quadrille, the chess game and
"Jabberwocky," whose slithy toves gyre and gimble in the wabe. ("Don't be
classical," White chided the dancers at one rehearsal. "Do it like a tove
would do it.");    The costumes were designed by Shawn Stuart, Curtis'
longtime partner, who also thought up the idea for its ingenious, economical
sets. The scenery, designed and built by George Pettit, consists of seven
periaktoi -- three-sided, 10-foot-high movable pillars, whose name and concept
come from the Hellenistic theater of the first and second centuries A.D. Each
has a man inside, who walks it around the stage; there's a different
configuration for each stopping place in Alice's journey.;    The ballet's
familiar characters include Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mock Turtle and the
Gryphon, the White Rabbit and the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts and the
White Knight.;    Alice will be danced by Sharon Wehner, a 15-year-old
sophomore at Live Oak High School. A third-year company member, Wehner has
been a snowflake and a demi-soloist in the divertissement of the annual
"Nutcracker.";    Ralph White, the choreographer's husband, an actor
accustomed to working in dance, plays the White Knight. Her son, David
Roxander, who just retired after 18 years with the National Ballet of Canada,
is dancing the Beamish Boy, slayer of the fierce Jabberwock.;    "It's the
first time in many years we've worked together as a family," said White -- and
how appropriate for a ballet that's intended as a family affair.;  The
Adventures of Alice; San Jose Dance Theater; When: 8 tonight, 2 p.m.

   Love Conquers Almost All
   ----
   By Merle Rubin

<LP>
   Apart from Gothic romances, there are not many novels
these days that celebrate the escapist theme of love as a
magic cure-all defying common sense. Far more novelists seem
to be concerned with demonstrating how romantic delusions can
deprive people -- especially women -- of freedom, peace of
mind, and, occasionally, life and limb. Yet, in her third
novel, "Temples of Delight," (Grove Weidenfeld, 311 pages,
$19.95), the South African-born Barbara Trapido, who's lived
in England since 1963 and deftly appropriated the polished
style of sophisticated British social comedy, applies her
sharp sense of social nuances and her dry wit to advance the
old-fashioned proposition that love conquers all.
   Alice Pilling is a bright, blond, levelheaded English
schoolgirl, whose adolescent world is transformed by the
arrival of a new girl in the middle of the term: Veronica
Bernadette McCrail, who styles herself "Jem" (after the
"jem-sengwiches" in P.G. Wodehouse, as she glibly informs her
incredulous teachers). In a school full of scrubbed,
upper-middle-class girls mainly interested in hockey matches,
Jem comes to class reading Lampedusa's "The Leopard" and
enchants Alice with astonishing stories of a French mother
who was "rudely forced" in the woods and a handsome father
who shaves to Gregorian chants and is so hyper-literary that
he thinks news reports on the decline of the pound refer to
the health of Ezra Pound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Alice is charmed by everything about her precocious new
friend, from her "exotic" background to her enthusiastic
disquisitions on the wonders of Mozart's "Magic Flute." Then,
one day, Jem disappears when the school authorities pass her
over and award what should have been her scholarship to a
prim, mean-spirited grade-grubber. A light goes out of
Alice's life. Outwardly, she proceeds as normal, going on to
Oxford, acquiring a suitable fiance (two, in fact, seriatim,
as in a fairytale). Everything looks right, but nothing feels
right. Then, a bizarre set of circumstances brings Jem back
into Alice's life, and through her, an exotic, high-strung
Italian-American man called Angeletti, who seems like Mr.
Wrong, but in the curious dream-logic of this boldly
anti-realist novel, turns out to be exactly the right person
to rekindle Alice's lost capacity for joy and delight.
   Invoking ghostly parallels with "The Magic Flute"
(Angeletti as Sarastro, Jem as a benign Queen of the Night),
Ms. Trapido invites us to suspend our customary suspicions of
overly charismatic people and our usual disbelief in
improbable happy endings. The aura of preciousness and
artifice surrounding the proceedings is occasionally a little
cloying, but Ms. Trapido has a light, sure touch that enables
her to carry it off with panache. By portraying the genuine
difficulties of Alice's various relationships -- the
deadening qualities of the seemingly sensible ones, the
liberating intensities of those that are based on romantic
love -- she manages to make the improbable surprisingly
possible.
   Asher and Sarah Rose, the happily married, middle-aged
Chicago Jewish couple in Susan Sussman's second novel, "Time
Off from Good Behavior," (Pocket Books. 274 pages, $20), are
as humorously "real" as the middle-aged and middle class are
expected to be in novels of this kind. Asher is a lovable guy
who's just sold the family company he built up from scratch.
Having made $20 million from the sale, Asher is looking
forward to travel and romance with his wife. Their children
have grown up. They are still in love. They've earned the
right to enjoy themselves.
   There's a slight glitch: After years of working on the
fringes of the costume design industry, Sarah has landed a
job designing clothes for a feature-length film. This is her
big chance, and she expects her husband to be as supportive
of her career as she was of his. Asher, however, feels lost
without his company to fuss over.
   Anxious to succeed in her work, Sarah sends Asher off to
Europe with her "permission" to have an affair if he likes:
time off for years of good behavior as a faithful husband and
devoted family man. Sarah herself finds temptation in the
form of a dashing set designer, who could take his pick from
hordes of ingenues but seems to prefer Sarah's mature charms.
   Even with her husband out of the house, Sarah can scarcely
concentrate on her work because of the incessant nagging of
her ailing mother, a self-dramatizing 78-year-old former
actress. It soon becomes clear that the real problem isn't
Sarah's hapless, self-effacing spouse, but her prima donna of
a mother.
   The story is narrated alternately by Sarah and Asher, who
unfortunately sound very much alike. Ms. Sussman relies on
heavy doses of wisecracking, supposedly self-deprecatory
humor that only thinly disguises her characters' basic,
unflappable self-satisfaction. Still, this novel has its
funny moments of desperation, and its moments of wisdom that
come from having survived the desperation. As Sarah tells her
own daughter, who is on the verge of a divorce, "You show me
a woman who hasn't fantasized getting in the car and leaving
home and I'll show you a woman who doesn't drive. . . . But
if you love someone, you get through it."

It's time to celebrate Independence Day and, not coincidentally, the second Los 
Angeles Times Magazine fiction issue. We have collected five new stories from 
western writers that will transport you on horseback to Culver City, put you 
through grad school at Stanford, admit you to a magic show on the Kern River, 
effect your escape from Seguin, Tex., or teach you the scientific name of the 
housefly. So light the sparklers, slice the watermelon and put on your reading 
sunglasses. Happy Fourth!

MAX SCHOTT 
</P>
<P>
"Writing," Max Schott says, "is a way of thinking about my own past." In fact, 
the characters and events in "Shannon" (Page 18) are autobiographical: There 
was a stable owner who was like a second father to Schott when he was growing 
up in Culver City; there was a girl who died trick riding and another who 
fibbed her way into the stable where he worked. "The story was inspired by 
memories, but I was also fascinated by ideas of independence in rodeo girls. 
They simply wouldn't be imposed on by anyone. They fascinated me as a kind of 
ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the cast of "Shannon" is also the cast of Schott's latest novel, "Ben," 
published last month by North Point Press. Schott, a horse trainer and rodeo 
roper till he was 30, is 55 and a professor of writing and literature at UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
SANDRA CISNEROS 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Cisneros, 35, a Chicago-born Texan, calls herself a "migrant professor." 
She has taught for the past few years on three California campuses -- most 
recently at UC Irvine. Her story, "Woman Hollering Creek" (Page 14), is all 
about reality: "The soap operas are real," she says, "the people are real; the 
character Cleofilas is based on a woman I encountered, helped escape from an 
abusive husband. And a creek by the name Woman Hollering really does exist in 
Texas. When I passed over it, I gave a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' collection of short stories, "The House on Mango Street," won the 
Before Columbus Book Award in 1985; "Woman Hollering Creek" will appear in a 
new collection due from Random House in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
ETHAN CANIN 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what writers say, most stories are about ourselves," says Ethan 
Canin. "The facts might change a little, but not much." Canin, 29, lives in San 
Francisco, but he grew up in Pennsylvania and small-town Ohio, a self-confessed 
"sort of semi-nerd." He majored in English at Stanford and left Harvard Medical 
School one month away from obtaining an MD. 
</P>
<P>
His story, "The Scientific Method" (Page 10), is excerpted from a 
novel-in-progress that will be published next year by Houghton Mifflin. It 
expands on the story "American Beauty," which appeared in Canin's best-selling 
collection, "Emperor of the Air," in 1988. This fall, Canin will teach writing 
at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
ALICE ADAMS 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners" (Page 24) is just a few months out of Alice Adams' typewriter. 
Since 1966, she has published six novels ("Superior Women," in 1985, was a 
bestseller), four short-story collections and many individual pieces. She began 
by writing "awfully bad" poetry but gave it up in college. It wasn't until she 
was 40 that her first novel was published. 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners," Adams says, contains a theme that especially interests her: 
"the myth of the evil Easterner and the good Westerner." 
</P>
<P>
Adams lives in San Francisco; her latest novel, "The Last Lovely City," will be 
released next spring by Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
GERALD HASLAM 
</P>
<P>
"Quintessentially Californian" is the way Gerald Haslam's dozens of Central 
Valley essays and short stories are usually described. "Writing about rural 
California," Haslam says, "has been to my advantage. Outsiders think we all 
roller skate to hot tubs, but we also work in the oil fields. I get a lot of 
creative energy from that tension." 
</P>
<P>
Haslam, 53, teaches English at Sonoma State University. "Upstream" (Page 30) is 
taken from "That Constant Coyote," published last month by the University of 
Nevada Press. 
</P>
<P>
"What does 'Upstream' mean? I honestly don't know," he says. "It's a tall tale, 
about primordial escape, I guess. Who knows where such a story comes from?"

<LEADPARA>  George Gobel, the sad-eyed comic with the flat-top haircut whose battles with
his TV wife, "Spooky Old Alice," added a dimension to 1950s domestic warfare,
died Sunday at 71.;    Sam Honigberg, his friend and publicist for nearly 40
years, said Gobel had suffered a series of strokes, which left him unable to
walk, and had undergone surgery nearly a month ago to determine whether his
mobility could be improved.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SINGING COMEDIAN GEORGE GOBEL DIES
DEADPAN HUMOR WAS TV HIT IN '50S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "He may have had another stroke" and died at Encino Hospital in Los
Angeles, Honigberg said.;    Gobel had several nicknames during his long
career, which began when he was 11 and sang as "Little George Gobel" on
radio's "The National Barn Dance.";    He next became "Lonesome George,"
singer of sad cowboy ballads in which he would pick at his guitar while pining
for lost loves or evenings on the prairie.;    On television, 20-plus years
later, Gobel enriched the language with such phrases as "Well, I'll be a dirty
bird" and "You don't hardly get those no more." His underplayed, deadpan humor
contrasted with other TV comics of the day -- frenetic entertainers such as
Milton Berle and Red Skelton.;    His flair as a teller of tall tales, kept
him at, or near, the top of the ratings throughout the 1954-to-1960 run of
"The George Gobel Show.";    The NBC show, which won him an Emmy in 1955,
started with an opening monologue, a sketch or song by a guest star and then
the inevitable aggravation he suffered at the hands of his wife, Alice. Had
CBS's "Gunsmoke" not been his opposition, his series might have lasted even
longer.;    George Leslie Gobel was born in Chicago to a grocer father and a
mother who taught piano.;    Gobel's interest in entertainment began as a
child, when he imitated his father's customers. He learned to play guitar in
grammar school and sang in a church choir. The choir appeared on a Chicago
radio station, and his solo won him an invitation to the Barn Dance program.; 
  Gobel learned to fly and in 1943 enlisted in the Army Air Corps.;    In
1961, Gobel was featured on Broadway in a musical adaptation of George
Abbott's "Three Men on a Horse," retitled "Let It Ride." He also toured in
"The Odd Couple" and "The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.";    His films included
"The Birds and the Bees" and "I Married a Woman." He did many voice-overs for
TV commercials and was a regular on the syndicated "Hollywood Squares" game
show.;    There was a real Alice in Gobel's life -- high school sweetheart,
Alice Humecki, whom he married in 1942. She and their two daughters, son and
three grandchildren survive him.  </TEXT>

The Peter Pan Players' production of "Alice in Wonderland" has enough whimsy 
and magic to make Lewis Carroll proud. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's staging at Iglesia Community Park in Laguna Hills follows Alice's 
fantasy romp through day-glo daisies, past a smiling Cheshire cat, a bellowing 
queen and a break-dancing king. Directed by Saul Siedman, the show includes 58 
local children, some of whom shared characters with another cast that took over 
after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour show, targeted for very young children, featured Courtney Weber 
and Monica Bromberg as Alice, Kimberly Reed as the White Rabbit, Angela Gage as 
the Queen of Hearts and Nathaniel Dawkins as the King. 
</P>
<P>
Children in the audience giggled through the show's flights of fancy, including 
Brett Levisohn's delirious Mad Hatter, the Cheshire cat's glow-in-the-dark 
smile and the shrinking Alice. After a bite of the mushroom, Alice disappeared 
behind a fungus and emerged as a girl half her size (played by 3-year-old 
Danielle Martino). 
</P>
<P>
The play was choreographed by Jill Kaplan, costumes were created by Jena 
Bouvion and Patricia Reed and scenery was designed by Helen Danielson. 
</P>
<P>
The show is sponsored by the Orange County Department of Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alice in Wonderland" continues this weekend at Iglesia Community Park, 24671 
Via Iglesia, Laguna Hills. Performances at 1 and 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. 
Sunday. Tickets: 50 cents for mat seating and $1 for chairs. Information: (714)

FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: New England, hilarious but serious - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In New England, Richard Nelson has written a play at once brilliantly
accomplished and repulsively artificial. Every word, every scene, makes its
contribution to the whole. And not a word, not a scene, rings true.
Nelson is perhaps the most eminent of the several American playwrights who
now have the world premieres of their plays take place in London. New
England, set in America today, covers the events of one weekend, starting
almost at once with the onstage suicide of Harry, before the very eyes of
his cohabitrix, Alice. Harry's children and brother promptly arrive. None of
them know Alice well, and none of them have ever previously met Tom, who
happens to have arrived as Alice's weekend guest some two minutes before
Harry blew his brains out. What follows is as hilarious as it is serious. Oh
yes, and all of them are English expats living in various parts of the US:
hence the ironic title.
Nelson's brilliance is most evident in his ability to keep juggling several
dissimilar objects in the air at once. In one scene, two of Harry's children
and Tom do a jigsaw while airing various features of their own
Americanophobia, while the floorboards overhead tell everyone in the house
that Alice and Harry's brother Alfred have been having sex for the past
hour. Meanwhile, all of them are trying to come to terms with Harry's
suicide and are engaged artfully in preserving the illusion of fluent
discourse while actually jumping from subject to subject. Here and
everywhere else, Nelson can sustain separate currents of farce, misery,
pathos, satire, irony, suspense, and cultural commentary.
But so what? Even in the four or five minutes before Harry becomes the late
Harry, the lines have been ringing hollow: with the blatantly
pseudo-naturalism of their construction, their self-interruptions, their
contrived non-sequiturs, their awful theatricality. 'Take it easy, this
can't be easy' - spoken by Tom to Alice - is a minor, but typical, example
of Nelson's cleverness. What is its effect? Less to reveal Tom's efforts to
console Alice than to show us how admirable Nelson is in this little feat of
putting two apparently contradictory sentences back to back in unbroken
flow. Why is the jigsaw scene there at all? So that Harry's son Paul can
utter lines (about apportioning jigsaw areas) 'The sky is mine.' Poor
Chekhov, whose tragicomic influence is everywhere obvious, must be blushing
in his grave; for Nelson's artfulness is not what he - Chekhov - had in mind
at all.
Ironically, it is the theme for which Nelson is most renowned -
Anglo-American relations - which he has crafted least successfully here.
Most of the time, the occasional discussions that these English expats have
about the American culture in which they live are mere set pieces that could
be replaced by discussions of sex or traffic or art to the same effect (and
most of the play could be happening in England anyway).
There are, we eventually see, two plot connections between Harry's suicide
and his Americanophobe despair: the facts that he never told Alice that his
wife was still alive in England until two months ago (and was still his
wife) and that, only minutes before his suicide and before the play's start,
he had reviled his daughter Gemma on the phone for planning to marry an
illiterate gardener's assistant in New Mexico ('the barbarians are sweeping
over us'). Nelson leaves these bombs hanging unexploded in the air. Which
should be brilliant - except that the very way he shows the characters
avoiding their significance is too neat.
Nelson is often funny. There are lines and stories that make us laugh aloud,
and others at which we chuckle inwardly. On a larger scale, though, he
creates characters and situations without a jot of freshness in them. Paul's
French wife Sophie - humourless, possessive, coolly paranoid - is obviously
introduced solely as a two-dimensional comic device. Yet which of the
characters is three-dimen-sional? I could believe in none of them.
Peter Gill's production and the performances by the seven actors are exactly
in harmony with the play: polished, fluent, amusing, contrived in their
naturalism, and unconvincing. Angela Thorne is Alice; Selina Cadell and
Diana Hardcastle are Harry's daughters Elizabeth and Gemma; Duncan Bell and
Annie Corbier are Paul and his wife Sophie; David Burke doubles as Harry and
his twin brother Alfred; Mick Ford is poor Tom. Possibly the play would seem
more persuasive if it were played with more spontaneity, but that would be
to swim against the current of its writing. New England reminds us of real
life to the extent that a Faberge egg reminds us of a hen's egg.

<DESCRIPT>  CAMPBELL; HISTORY; HOUSING; SHOW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A walk through a portion of the past will be held this Saturday during the
Campbell Historic Home Tour.;    Six houses displaying architectural styles of
the 1800s and the 1920s and 1930s are included on the tour. All the homes are
on the Campbell Historic Register and several have been meticulously restored
to preserve details of those bygone times.  </LEADPARA>

SIX-SITE EVENT TO BENEFIT AINSLEY PROJECT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Also ran in EX1/6, EX2/7  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The houses will be open for viewing between noon and 5 p.m. The tour can
start at any of the homes.;    Tickets are $10 on the day of the tour. A
hostess will greet visitors at each of the homes and provide historical
accounts of the house and interesting facts about the former occupants.;   
The event is sponsored by the Campbell Historic Museum Association and the
Campbell Historic Preservation Board, and proceeds will benefit the Ainsley
House Restoration and Museum Project.;    The English Tudor cottage revival
house, and a carriage house, were donated to the city of Campbell by the
granddaughters of J.C. Ainsley, the original owner and a pioneer in fruit
canning, drying, and packing. The Ainsley House was moved last November to its
new location in Campbell's Civic Center, where it is being renovated for use
as the Campbell Historical Museum.;    A variety of funding sources are being
used to pay for the roughly $2 million renovation. The Campbell Historical
Museum Association, which will have offices in the Ainsley House, has agreed
to raise $1 million.;    The Campbell Historic Home Tour has been organized by
a Museum Association committee chaired by Joanna Herz.;    Herz and her
husband, Rudi, own the Young-Sartorette House, one of the homes on the tour.
The couple moved the English cottage-style house from its original location on
South Bascom Avenue 10 years ago to its present location at 1888 White Oaks
Road.;    "Some people might think of preservation with a 'George Washington
Slept Here' mentality, but it is equally important to realize what working men
and women did for our country and what made America great," said Herz.;   
"This tour in Campbell features the former homes of working people; the
orchardists, farmers, cannery people who were the economic backbone of this
area. By preserving these homes, and others like it, we can show how these
people lived and what was important to them. And, in seeing some of the values
they had, we can incorporate them into our lives today.";    The
Young-Sartorette House was designed and built in 1928 for Earl and Virginia
Young. Earl Young, a farmer and insurance agent, was also active in the Prune
and Apricot Growers Association. W.C. and Colette Sartorette purchased the
home in the 1930s. W.C. Sartorette was a longtime trustee in the Cambrian
School District and a leader in the building of 10 schools. Sartorette School
is named for him.;    The other houses on the tour are:;    (check) First
Ainsley House: The Queen Anne cottage was the first house J.C. Ainsley owned
after he came to Campbell in 1887. Originally located at the corner of
Winchester Boulevard and Campbell Avenue, the house is now located at 84 N.
Third St. The property was purchased in 1921 by the Campbell elementary school
district and moved to the rear of the property to make way for a new school
building. The district sold the house in 1930 to the only bidder, Antone
Ferro, the school janitor. Ferro moved the home to its current location. Barry
Shilman and Susan Blake purchased the home in 1977.;    (check) Galindo-Leigh
House: Listed on the National Register, the home at 140 Peter Drive was
started in the 1830s by Juan Galindo, a Spaniard who added to the structure
over the years to house his 11 children. John D. Gueraz was the next owner and
his additions to the home reflect a Swiss heritage and Louisiana French
plantation background. A British aristocrat, Delicia Leigh, was the next owner
and she added Victorian embellishments. Leigh Avenue is named for her family.
The house's current owner is Hilles Podesta.;    (check) Righter House:
Located at 599 El Patio, the house was built in 1896 for F.M. and Belle
Righter. Righter was an advocate of farm cooperatives who wrote a pamphlet
that greatly influenced raisin growers in the state. The couple's son, C.E.
"Swede" Righter became Campbell's first Olympic gold medalist as a member of
the 1920 U.S. Rugby team. A railroad buff, F.M. Righter had the house built
facing the railroad tracks. W. Graham and Jane Wood purchased the home in
1985.;    (check) Ralph Hyde House: The California Craftsman bungalow at 227
Alice Ave. was home to Ralph and Maud Hyde, son and daughter-in-law of George
Hyde, local packing company owner, and his wife, Alice Hill Hyde, after whom
Alice Street is named. The Ralph Hydes, and later their son, Homer, owned the
Campbell Water Co. for many years. Homer Hyde was a former mayor of Campbell.
Rick and Jackie Costanzo purchased the home in 1983.;    (check) Kennedy
House: A Spanish colonial style home at 61 Catalpa Lane, the house was built
in 1930 for Erle and Bessie Kennedy. Kennedy, a successful farmer and property
owner, and his wife were well-known for their community involvement. When they
subdivided their ranch in the 1940s, they curved Catalpa Lane around their
home rather than pay $10,000 to move it. Councilwoman Jeanette Watson and her
husband, Courtland, purchased the home in 1960.;    During the tour,
refreshments will be served at one of the homes and a boutique featuring items
by several local organizations and individuals will be held at another.;   
The Downtown Campbell Business Association also will be displaying items
appropriate to the period of the various houses. The San Jose Model A Club
will display a variety of restored 1930s Ford automobiles.  </TEXT>

POP CAPSULES : COOPER: FREAKY SIDESHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Cooper was wearing dresses before David Bowie became an androgynous 
rebel, and he did stupid pet tricks with reptiles before Ozzy Osbourne went 
batty. Still, Cooper is generally considered a freaky sideshow rather than a 
rock pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
His concert at the Pantages Theatre on Saturday was a forceful reminder that 
the endearingly tacky ghoul-rocker's anthems like "Eighteen" have influenced 
everything from punk to metal. History doesn't mean much, though, when you're 
only as valid as last week's sales report, so Cooper (who also plays San 
Diego's California Theatre on Thursday) alternated his familiar shock-rockers 
with material from his latest album, "Trash." These songs, as faceless as most 
Republican-era rock, fit the Bon Jovi hit formula: predictable sing-alongs 
blasted with a technical efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Cooper will headline Lee Atwater's next function. Washington 
wives might be chagrined by the show's re-staging of the rumble from "West Side 
Story," with Cooper slashing a girl's throat before singing "Only Women Bleed." 
But these contrived, comic-book theatrics are really as inoffensive as a 
spook-house ride. In fact, the most frightening part of the evening was 
probably the drum solo. CRAIG LEE

BROOKLYN PROSECUTOR CALLS IT 'A TERRIFYING SOCIAL PHENOMENON'; 
</P>
<P>
ABUSE, NEGLECT OF DEPENDENT ELDERS EMERGES AS NEW 'NATIONAL PASTIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years and a bad hip weighing heavily 
-- but not as heavily as the need to get away from her 52-year-old son who was 
waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street, Alice headed for 
a neighbor's phone to let the police know that he had turned abusive again. 
</P>
<P>
"You work and support a child all your life," she said, "then they act like 
they hate you." 
</P>
<P>
Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million elderly people may 
be abused, researchers say, often by their children, grandchildren, even 
great-grandchildren -- the very people they depend on for help in their old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens with these blood relatives -- sons, daughters, nieces, nephews," 
said Dorothy Brodie, a 75-year-old retired social worker who works with the 
Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Abuse Common 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do things like keep telling the victim 'You're stupid. You're senile. 
You have Alzheimer's disease.' They'll do things like maybe even taking their 
dentures away so they're forced to eat soft food; or take eyeglasses away so 
they can't even read a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
One in 25 older adults is abused, according to an estimate in a 1985 report to 
Congress, "Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace." The abuse takes all forms: 
psychological torment, neglect, theft -- and often, it is physical. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, an 18-year-old man punched and kicked his 87-year-old 
great-grandmother and later explained that: "She bugs me because she asks me to 
fix her something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
A 54-year-old salesman on Long Island was charged last year with having 
brutalized his parents for three years while demanding that they turn over 
their life savings. When they saw police arrive, neighbors asked, "Did he kill 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
"'This is a terrifying social phenomenon," said Elizabeth Holtzman, district 
attorney of the New York borough of Brooklyn, where reports of such abuse have 
risen 400% since 1986, to 370 cases last year. She attributed the increase to 
the widespread use of crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Statistics 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported nationwide, 10% more than 
in 1987, said Toshio Tatara, director of the National Aging Resource Center on 
Elder Abuse in Washington, D.C. "People still find it incredible that we abuse 
our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years ago -- and we're 
doing it like a national pastime." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tatara estimated that just one in 14 incidents is likely to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
The typical victim is 75 or older, a woman and generally dependent. The abuser 
often is a son or daughter, the congressional report said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old South Carolina woman whose daughter 
kept her in a room that was so cold the urine in a catheter froze; about a 
75-year-old retired nurse from Massachusetts whose 42-year-old son attacked him 
with a hatchet; about a San Francisco woman whose $167,000 estate was whittled 
to $3,000 by a son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are really difficult and scary, even to experienced social 
workers," said Lucy Friedman, director of the Victim Services Agency in New 
York, which helped Alice seek a temporary restraining order against her son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Blames 'the Wine' 
</P>
<P>
"I was really afraid of him," said Alice. She still bears a scar on her neck 
where her son once sliced her. "Once he gets the wine, he goes crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The abusers many times have their own problems: a drug or alcohol problem, 
being out of work, broke or mentally unstable. The violent treatment may be 
repayment for abuse that the son or daughter received as a child. A crowded 
home may spark it; middle-aged people free at last of their own children may 
resent having to take in a frail parent. In some cases, the stress of caring 
for an elderly relative is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics called to a home in San Fernando, Calif., found 77-year-old Virginia 
Grimes Jeter covered with excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died 
five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's daughter, Cynthia Jeter Green, 39, had promised her mother she 
would not put her in an old folks' home, prosecutor Lee Harris said. A 
probation report described Green as "under a degree of emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Sentenced 
</P>
<P>
She pleaded no contest to abuse charges and was ordered to get psychiatric 
counseling and perform 300 hours of community service. She did not return 
several calls from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to put their loved 
ones in a nursing home, or feel they have to be responsible for total care, is 
fairly common in these cases," Rosalie Wolf, associate director of the 
University Center on Aging at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution is getting older people to take responsibility for 
stopping, even preventing abuse, said Lee Pearson, assistant manager of 
criminal justice services for the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people should keep regular appointments and stay in touch with old 
friends, especially after moving in with a relative, Pearson said. They should 
have someone stop by once a week to make sure that all is well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Assistance 
</P>
<P>
New York's Victim Services Agency maintains a 24-hour phone line for access to 
counseling and help in court, getting locks changed, and finding shelter, 
transportation and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
In a Bronx group shelter called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what 
has happened to them and try to make sense of it. 
</P>
<P>
"People just believe and hope so much that this will be the last time, that 
things will change, he won't do it again -- but they do," said Diana Walcott, 
director of the Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project and leader of Safe Place. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents blame themselves, Friedman said. "They say 'Well, how did I bring 
up this monster?' " 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring that 
abuse be reported, but those involved with the cases say the nation has a long 
way to go toward recognizing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The states spend an average of $22 to aid each abused child, but just $2.90 for 
an abused older person, Congress found. Its report recommended emergency 
shelters, tax credits for families caring for older adults, amendments to 
Medicare and Medicaid to eliminate limits on benefits and services to elderly 
people in relatives' homes, as well as mandatory reporting of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so foreign to our thinking," said Holtzman. "Doctors won't even ask if 
abuse has taken place. It's possible the person . . . will be sent back to the 
same environment, possibly to be killed."

ALICE KAHN: GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weird to be in high school again after all these years. Some things are the 
same; some things are different. The French have an expression for this, but I 
don't know what it is because I took Spanish. I heard it was easier. 
</P>
<P>
One thing you immediately notice that is different is that everyone in class 
seems to be over 40. It's Back to School Night at my daughter's high school, 
and for one evening I must live through a condensed version of what she lives 
through every day. 
</P>
<P>
Our classes are 10 minutes instead of 50, which is about as long as I could 
ever sit still in a high school class. When the bell rings, we must figure out 
the difficult task: how to get from the top of H Building to the bottom of C 
Building in five minutes. Even aerobically correct mothers come panting in 
late, saying, "This is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
That five-minute fix of hall time is still my favorite part of high school. I 
walk through the halls as I did then, my eyes scanning for Whom I Know. 
</P>
<P>
There are three kinds of parents I see at Back to School Night. There are 
people who look familiar and I can't place. These are the people I'll pass and 
then suddenly stop dead and scream down the hall of G Building, "Hey, you're my 
gynecologist!" 
</P>
<P>
There are the parents I don't know. We sit in class together and share grins of 
solidarity as the teacher says, "Of course, your student has told you that the 
essay is due tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the parents I know from various past lives: political groups, 
support groups, Lamaze class, our kids' nursery school, grade school, camp, 
Brownies, as well as old friends from the days when we had time for a social 
life. Sometimes we look at each other as if we are mirror images of Dorian 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice, is that you?" says some old lady. I realize with horror that she's my 
age! 
</P>
<P>
I say "Hi" in C Hall to Bob and Roxanne. (Still together, I note.) Their 
daughter is a senior. "Where's Leah going to college?" I ask them. 
</P>
<P>
"As close to the beach as possible," is the reply. 
</P>
<P>
Bob -- Butcher Bob, as I knew him when his long black hair was restrained with 
a macrame headband -- is right on target. His beard is graying. But his wife 
Roxanne is a traitor. Her blond hair isn't even turning dishwater brown. 
There's not a wrinkle in her face. "Throw her in the sun," I say as I dash off 
to Trig. 
</P>
<P>
We pass a guy named Steve who was there for the baby boy he had in 1974, the 
year he shaved his head. The son he had named Moonlight is currently going by 
the name of Dan. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and his now ex-wife sat side by side in class, each holding a baby from 
their latest marriages. All very friendly. And Steve has no need to shave his 
head anymore. One more year and time will accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
As we go through the classes, I realize how the scene changes, depending on 
what role you're playing. When I was a student, I thought that all that the 
teachers cared about was coming up with irrational and boring assignments. I 
viewed it as my role then to assert creative control of the classroom through a 
constant volley of wisecracks. Through my cleverness, I spent a lot of time 
writing "I Will Not" statements and managed to keep my grade-point average 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, when it was my turn to serve on the other side of the desk, 
as a young high school teacher, I saw the obstacles to creative teaching. It 
wasn't just the pay, it was the politics. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when I explained my course at a Back to School Night, a dad suddenly 
stood up, waved the book I had assigned and screamed, "You are blaspheming 
God's name!" 
</P>
<P>
The book was Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
In class tonight, I see the teachers struggling to juggle the various political 
dumbbells that might smack them in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The journalism teacher explains that the students are critiquing humor columns 
that have appeared recently in the school paper to see if they are racist or 
sexist. (I really need to hear about offensive humor columns when I'm off 
duty!) 
</P>
<P>
The biology teacher answers a parent by saying that no, she did not, intend to 
kill frogs. "We have computer programs to dissect frogs now," she says. The 
approving nod from the parent tells the teacher she has passed. 
</P>
<P>
The English teacher explains that they are reading Arthur Miller's "The 
Crucible." A father raises his hand. "Are you linking that to McCarthyism and 
the Communist witch hunts?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she tells him, that's the whole point. He says, "Good! Good!" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you linking it to the Salem witch hunts?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
She stares at me uncertainly. Dumb parents are not in her contract. 
</P>
<P>
Now, why do I still do things like that? 
</P>
<P>
One more smart-alecky question from you, Alice, and you'll have to write 100 
times: "I will act like a grown-up on parents' night."

HART OF GOLD: Who's the world's youngest popster? Our money's on Taro Hart, son 
of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, who is the co-star of Hart's new album, 
"Music to Be Born By," the perfect gift for your crystal-worshiping New Age 
chums. Due out from Rykodisc in March, the record features Taro's heartbeat in 
the womb accompanied by Hart's performance on drums, bass and wooden flute. 
According to Hart, the music is designed to provide child-bearing women with a 
"soundscape of comforting patterns to assist in the birthing process." . . . 
Are you ready for a video magazine devoted to (gasp) heavy metal? It's called 
"Hard 'N Heavy," with a premiere hourlong issue devoted to uncensored videos 
from Ozzy Osbourne and Anthrax, an Alice Cooper career retrospective, scenes 
from Motley Crue mainstay Vince Neil's feature film debut (in "Police Academy 
VI") and other headbanger highlights. The video, which is due out every two 
months, will retail for $20. . . . Sandra Bernhard's notorious one-woman 
Off-Broadway show, "Without You I'm Nothing," will be immortalized on vinyl in 
May, thanks to Enigma Records. The two-album sound track includes the 
acid-tongued comedienne's renditions of Prince's "Little Red Corvette" and 
Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs. Jones." Of Enigma, Bernhard said: "It's the home of 
Poison and Stryper, so I couldn't be happier." . . . Speaking of Enigma -- it's 
launching an Enigma Retro label that will feature classic out-of-print releases 
(though only on CD or cassette). The label debuts with very early Alice Cooper 
("Pretties for You"), the GTO's ("Permanent Damage") with releases from Ted 
Nugent, Lord Buckley and Lenny Bruce to follow.

Of Federal and State Tax

   AND BOB AND CAROL and Ted and Alice thought they knew all the angles? 

   (We borrow the familiar names to relate a gift-tax scam involving brothers.) 
One may give $10,000 a year each to any number of people, free of gift tax. 
So, in 1982 through 1985, Bob and Carol each gave $10,000 to each of their two children and Ted and Alice's three children; Ted and Alice each gave $10,000 to each of the five children. 
Also in 1982, Ted and Alice each gave $15,000 ($5,000 over the limit) to each of Bob and Carol; in 1983 and 1984, Ted and Alice each gave $10,000 to each of Bob and Carol. 

   In the next episode, the IRS audited the foursome, who claimed that only the $5,000 excesses of 1982 were subject to gift tax. 
But in private ruling 8717003, the IRS takes the couples to task and tax: The reciprocal transfers between families were related and generally equal. 
They doubled what each child got. 
Ted's and Alice's gifts to Bob and Carol in effect repaid gifts to Ted and Alice's third child. 

   The IRS found that each parent should be treated as having given each of his or her own children $20,000 a year -- twice the exempt sum. 

   IRS WARNINGS to abusive-shelter investors are upheld by appeals judges. 

   U.S. Judge Neese in Nashville, Tenn., found that Mid-South Music Corp. promoted illegal shelters. 
But in 1985, he also ordered the IRS to pay damages for illegally revealing company tax information to investors; IRS letters, sent before it took public action against Mid-South, warned investors that they risked audits and penalties if they claimed the shelter deductions. 

   The IRS turned to the sixth-circuit appeals court. 
Now a three-judge panel has held that the IRS's pre-filing notices didn't violate the confidentiality of Mid-South's returns and has reversed the damage award. 
Judge Norris said the notices identified Mid-South as a shelter promoter, not a taxpayer, and gave "no indication" that its returns were being audited or investigated. 

   ANON. WRITES another hit: The official tax-act handbook. 

   The "General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Prepared by the Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation," or "blue book," is a best seller for the Government Printing Office. 
Some 13,450 copies of the first printing of 14,870 have been sold at $31, mailing included. 
Experts peruse the 1,379 pages, especially notes on probable technical corrections, to see how far the anonymous authors have advanced understanding of what Congress really meant. 

   But Uncle Sam can be undersold: Prentice-Hall, using "non-archival paper," sells a two-pound, 1.7-ounce facsimile at $16 prepaid, including mailing; the GPO book weighs two pounds, 10.5 ounces. 
Commerce Clearing House offers a one-pound, 13.4-ounce facsimile at $15, plus mailing. 
Both publishers report brisk sales above the tens of thousands of copies given to their regular subscribers. 
Two publishers resell the GPO book-Bureau of National Affairs for $51, Tax Notes magazine for $48 plus mailing. 

   Just out is a separate, 235-page explanation of 1986 technical corrections to past acts; GPO price, $6.50. 

   AFTER THEIR DIVORCE, Louise stayed on with Billy in Indianapolis to look after their seven kids. 
He paid all her expenses; they later had another child. 
She wasn't just employed as a housekeeper, as the IRS argued, the Tax Court decided. 
It let Billy claim his ex-wife as a dependent. 

   MOVING ON: Roger Olsen, resigning June 4 as assistant attorney general for tax, will join the Los Angeles office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson Aug. 1. 
John Murray is retiring as deputy assistant attorney general for tax this week to join an unidentified law firm. 

   INFORMATION RETURNS, such as the Form 1099 reports on interest payments by banks, must be filed in high-volume cases on magnetic tape or other "machine-readable" forms. 
New IRS rules say failure to comply will subject a payer to penalties for failing to file the reports at all. 

   ROYALTIES may be costly for software corporations that chose "S" status. 

   Tax revision created incentives for a closely held regular corporation to become an S corporation, taxed like a partnership. 
But many computer-programming concerns that get passive income -- royalties -- from licensing software fell unawares into a trap, says Charles Medallis of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., CPAs. 
They are successful concerns that ploughed profits into expansion and so had large earnings and profits on their books when they converted to S status. 

   The companies have run afoul of two S-corporation rules, Medallis says: First, if an S concern holds earnings and profits from its regular-corporation days, and over 25% of gross receipts is passive income (royalties), the excess passive income is taxable to the company (instead of only to its owners) at the highest corporate rate. 
Second, if that happens for three straight years, the company's S status is canceled. 

   Companies that would have trouble paying out profits to owners may seek to change the law, Medallis says. 

   BRIEFS: The IRS created an award plaque for law-enforcement people who make significant contributions to its criminal investigations. . . . 
The IRS issued instructions for the required reporting of real-estate transactions on Form 1099-B. . . . 
The House Ways and Means oversight panel plans hearings in the week of June 22 on exempt entities' taxable business activities.

   What a groovy guy that Jason Voorhees is _ ahead
of his time with that goalie mask fashion look, and ever so
creative with axes, knives and spears.
   He's a real human slice-and-dice machine, but not not too many
people like him. Still, they flock to see his movies _ seven so far
_ and he doesn't even have a speaking part.
   Here's a look at Jason's life and death and life and death in
the ``Friday the 13th'' sagas:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th'' (1980):
   Six frisky camp counselors reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which has
been closed for over two decades after a rash of unsolved murders.
A seventh, who hitchhikes to the camp, never quite makes it: She's
turned into a forest pizza. The other college-age dimwits romp
about until they, too, are carved into human kindling. Alice, the
last of the lot, runs into Mrs. Voorhees who lives nearby. She
promises to drive the hysterical girl to safety but instead talks
about her son, Jason, who drowned years ago while his counselors
made love in the woods. She turns on Alice with a hatchet; Alice
finally decapitates the madwoman and makes her way to a canoe which
drifts to the middle of the lake. In a blink, the drowned Jason
reaches up from his watery hell and grabs her. Alice abruptly
awakens in a hospital room to be told by police that Jason's body
was never found. Alice says: ``Then he's still there.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 2'' (1981):
   A new batch of hot-blooded morons begin counselor training at
Lake Region, near Camp Crystal Lake. The camp leader, Paul, talks
about Jason _ an icon by now _ and says he's really alive, living
off wild animals and waiting to avenge his mother's death. One by
one, and two by two the randy counselors-to-be encounter Jason, who
enthusiastically dispatches his victims with a curved machete, a
spear thrust through two bodies, a hammer. Finally, only Paul and
his girlfriend, Ginny, are left. Thinking Paul dead, Ginny tries to
flee. She ends up at Jason's cabin where she finds a shrine to his
dead mother containing her decapitated head. Paul shows up,
struggles with Jason, and Ginny slices up the ``dead'' boy's body
with the machete. Paul and Ginny return to the cabin, and Jason
crashes through the window. Ginny wakes up in an ambulance.
``Where's Paul?'' she asks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 3 _ 3-D'' (1982):
   Yet another group of idiots heads for the lake, amid newscasts
of mass murders. Three bikers show up to taunt them and are
promptly dispatched by our Jason, who picks off the vacationing
college kids with his usual finesse: He shoots an arrow through a
head, cleaves a body, electrocutes one guy, slits a neck, thrusts a
hot fireplace poker through a chest. As usual, one hysterical
female is left, Chris. After a struggle, she imbeds an ax in
Jason's head, runs to the lake and paddles a canoe to the center _
silly girl. When she awakens in the morning, Mrs. Vorhees' body,
dripping with rotted flesh, explodes from the water and pulls Chris
under. Police take a deranged Chris away and we catch one last (?)
glimpse of Jason, the ax still rooted in his skull, his fingers
twitching.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ The Final Chapter'' (1984):
   Ten people have been slaughtered at Crystal Lake. Jason also
lies dead. The bodies are taken to the morgue where Jason, perky as
ever, rises up, slits the throat of an attendant and guts a nurse.
Back at the lake, Mrs. Jarvis and her two children, Trish and
Tommy, are in their summer home. A group of teen-agers has moved in
next door. The party's soon over, though, as they're harpooned,
crucified, hacksawed and otherwise minced. But Tommy is a horror
freak who has a makeup collection, masks and clippings about Jason.
He saves his sister and himself by putting on a hockey mask,
confusing Jason and grabbing the machete. Tommy whacks his personal
hero again, and again and again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ A New Beginning'' (1985):
   Tommy Jarvis is now 18 and has nightmares about Jason. He lives
at a halfway house after being released from a mental institution.
Then the murders begin with axes, hunting knives and hedge shears
as the weapons du jour. Finally, Tommy comes face to face with
Jason who falls from a hayloft onto the steel spike teeth of a
tractor harrow. Rain washes away makeup from the corpse's face and
reveals the killer as a paramedic pretending to be Jason. Tommy,
who still has nightmares, is back in the hospital. He smiles
knowingly, pulls a hockey mask from his bureau, hides behind the
door and waits.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VI _ Jason Lives'' (1986):
   Crystal Lake has changed its name to Forest Green. Tommy Jarvis
is now an adult and still haunted. He believes that the only way he
ever have a normal life is to make sure Jason is REALLY dead. So he
returns to Crystal Lake to see Jason's grave. He pries open the
coffin during a storm, and a bolt of lightning hits the crowbar
he's used, sending a charge through the decayed corpse. The
rejuvenated Jason works his way back to the lake leaving a trail of
blood and guts. Tommy follows him, lures him to the lake and
somehow traps Jason in chains and rocks so that he sinks to his
original watery grave.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' (1988):
   Tina Shepard is telekinetic. While at Crystal Lake, her father
dies and she tries to bring him back. Instead, she accidentally
brings back Jason, who sets about doing what he does best.
Ultimately, Jason and Tina face off. Only this time when she does
some fancy brain work, she brings back her dead father, who
struggles with Jason and pulls him back to the depths of the lake,
where they set up housekeeping together until the next time?
