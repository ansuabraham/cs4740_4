DODGERS, ANGELS PLAN TALKS WITH FREE AGENT LANGSTON

Set to battle over free agents Mark Langston and Robin Yount in what may become 
a Freeway Series of a different nature, the Dodgers and Angels begin the 
process today, when Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president, meets 
with left-handed pitcher Langston and his agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, according to a source, have a Wednesday meeting with Langston and 
Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is believed to favor the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego Padres on the 
basis of location, but bidding is expected to stretch from coast to coast, and 
began Monday when the 90 players who filed for free agency were eligible to 
accept offers from clubs other than their own. 
</P>
<P>
Langston heard from only the Seattle Mariners, under new ownership since 
Langston, who spent five-plus seasons there, was traded to the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, as a center fielder who can bat leadoff, represents the solution to the 
Dodgers' two most pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Yount is vacationing in Hawaii. The speculation is that, at 34, he is reluctant 
to leave the American League and may be interested in the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tony DeMarco, the agent for free agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, 
said the Dodgers have increased their offer from one year to one year and an 
option for 1991, but the money in both years is still less than the $1.85 
million that Valenzuela received in 1989 and far less than the three-year, 
$6-million package that Valenzuela is believed to be seeking.

<LEADPARA>  THE morning-after found Mark Langston smiling, for a change.;    He was
happiest about having thrown strikes. He didn't do that last season. He didn't
do much of anything, except collect his paycheck, which was then among the
richest in baseball history.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THIS YEAR IS 'A DIFFERENT STORY' FOR ANGELS'
LANGSTON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Baseball
Around the Cactus League  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For $3.2 million, Langston gave the California Angels 10 wins, 17 losses
and a 4.40 ERA. In the bargain, he got a big case of self-doubt, the biggest,
he said, since his junior season at San Jose State in 1981.;    "I lacked
confidence last year," Langston said Tuesday morning. "This year, it's a
different story.";    For Langston, this year officially began Monday
afternoon at Packard Stadium, on the campus of Arizona State University.
There, against the San Diego Padres, Langston pitched three innings of
two-hit, shutout ball. He threw strikes. He threw hard. He won. He did all the
things he was expected to do last season.;    Explaining a season gone bad is
like explaining a marriage gone bad. You've got all kinds of reasons, and no
clue where to start. Which was the biggest? Which was first?;    Langston
insists on this much: The money had no part in it. None.;    When a guy signs
a big contract and then flops, the standard explanation is that he pressed, he
tried too hard to justify the salary he's making. It's tired, but very
possibly true. It's logical. It's in line with what we know about human
nature. But, where it concerns him, Langston fights this notion with the
bulldog tenacity for which he is not known.;    "I never thought about (the
money)," he says. "I don't think any guy could live up to that kind of
contract; you wouldn't even try. You're basically paid on what you've done in
the past, anyway. . . . It wasn't the money.";    The 1990 season began so
promisingly for Langston. Signed to a free-agent contract for five years and
$16 million, Langston made a debut that was worth every penny: He pitched a
no-hitter at Anaheim Stadium. Against his old team, no less. The downer was
that Langston couldn't finish the game; he left after seven innings and even
that had been a gamble, given the short spring training.;    It was mid-August
before Langston won another game at Anaheim Stadium. He lost nine straight
decisions there. He didn't win anywhere between June 5 and Aug. 1, his record
dropping from 4-5 to 4-13. At his worst, he was 5-15. He finished with his
lowest win total since 1985 and his most losses ever.;    "A lot of things
were involved," he said. "Probably, it was more mental than anything.";   
Langston got frustrated, understandably so. In early June, he lost 2-1 despite
12 strikeouts. Two weeks later, he lost again 2-1, despite striking out 10. In
June, Langston had a 2.36 ERA -- and a 1-3 record. And he let it get to him.; 
  "I kept looking at the next start as the one that would turn me around,"
Langston said, "and then, during the course of the game, I'd get defensive."; 
  He'd nibble at the corners. He'd fall behind. He'd walk the guy, or be
forced to come in with a hittable pitch. And the streak went on, including an
8-1 loss at home in which Langston allowed 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings and was
booed off the mound.;    Langston, 30, put in a winter of hard work, riding a
bike to build his legs and endurance. Not that either were a problem last
season.;    He also is ironing out a flaw in his delivery. Not that it
matters, either. Langston noticed the flaw while studying videotape; later, he
discovered he had pitched with the same flaw in 1988, when he went 15-11 for
Seattle.;    So it wasn't mechanics. And it wasn't physical. And, dammit, it
wasn't the money. Whatever it was, it's gone. It's a new year, a fresh start,
and that might make all the difference for Mark Langston in 1991.  </TEXT>

ANGELS SIGN LANGSTON TO BASEBALL'S RICHEST CONTRACT 
</P>

<P>
The California Angels boldly pursued and won baseball's premier free agent 
Friday when left-handed pitcher Mark Langston agreed to a guaranteed, 
five-year, $16-million contract that made him -- at least for the moment -- the 
highest-paid player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old San Diego native spurned "serious" proposals from the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees to enlist with the Angels, becoming the 
sixth starting pitcher on a staff that last season had the second-best 
earned-run average in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's contract, which will contain a no-trade clause, will be the longest 
given a professional baseball player since Eddie Murray signed a five-year pact 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 (Murray subsequently was traded to the 
Dodgers) and is the most lucrative guaranteed contract ever, surpassing the 
$13.6 million Dave Winfield was guaranteed by the Yankees in a 10-year deal 
before the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston also becomes baseball's third $3-million man, joining Minnesota's 
Kirby Puckett and Oakland's Rickey Henderson in that elite group. He will get a 
$1.5-million signing bonus, a 1990 salary of $1.5 million and a salary of $3.25 
million in each of the succeeding four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out to break ground in that regard," said Langston, the Angels' 
biggest free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson joined the club in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the dollar amounts discussed "without a doubt boggles the 
mind," security was paramount in Langston's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams were close, like the Dodgers and Yankees, but I think from the 
start -- from the very first meeting with the Angels -- meeting with (owners) 
Mr. and Mrs. (Gene and Jackie) Autry, the Angels were first-class, and from 
that point on, they took the lead," said Langston, who had a combined record of 
16-14 last season with the Seattle Mariners and Montreal Expos and has a career 
record of 86-76. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more comfortable with the situation they presented before me as far as 
the five-year deal and the no-trade provision. That's something that was very 
important to me. Every time we (he and agent Arn Tellem) said something, they 
responded. They were the front-runner as far as responding to everything we had 
to say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern was playing for a pennant-contending team," he said. "Even 
when I played for Seattle, I thought the Angels were classy and I always liked 
playing in Anaheim. I knew every year they would do what it took to put a 
winning team on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port, who in the past has been criticized for not 
aggressively pursuing free agents, said signing Langston will give him more 
options in trade discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant in the past to sign players for longer than two years, Port made an 
exception because of Langston's ability and the knowledge that another starter 
might have averted the late-season collapse that took the Angels out of the AL 
West race last summer. 
</P>
<P>
* DEALING AN ACE 
</P>
<P>
Langston is delighted but the Dodgers are disappointed by Angels' latest 
acquisition.

GOSPEL CHRISTMAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     His early poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" (1922), written the summer
after he graduated from high school (1922), is still a landmark work,
anthologized in countless college texts and collections. Later works were
built on speech rhythms derived from the blues and jazz.;   He won poetry
prizes and a writing scholarship to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania at a
time when blacks in the fine arts were almost as rare as unicorns. Though
circumspect about his sexual orientation, he also was honest about being gay
in a culture that has always viewed homosexuality with suspicion.;   In
addition to his own writings (poetry, novels, stories and an autobiography),
Hughes also translated the work of Federico Garcia Lorca and Gabriela Mistral
from the Spanish, wrote the lyrics to Kurt Weill's naturalistic folk opera
"Street Scene" and collected black poetry and folklore for two standard
anthologies published in the '50s. He also created a popular comic-strip
character, Jess B. Semple, who lived on the funny pages of the New York Post
for many years.;   In 1967, just before his death, he published "The Panther
and the Lash," a final burst of bitter poetry about the betrayal of
African-Americans by the compromises of civil rights.;   And in 1961, he wrote
"Black Nativity," a Christmas pageant with gospel music.;   Betty Gadling,
minister of music at Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, saw a production
of "Black Nativity" on television in the '60s, featuring Alex Bradford. She
obtained a copy of its still-unpublished script and spent years tracking down
its music.;   Some of the music was gospel standards, such as "Go Tell It On
the Mountain," and familiar Christmas carols. But some of it, like "Rise Up,
Shepherds, and Follow," she had never heard, she said.;   She located what she
could, with the help of several friends' collections and the library of the
American Baptist Theological Seminary of the West at the University of
California, Berkeley's Pacific School of Religion.;   "The rest we wrote," she
said matter-of-factly. Who is "we"? "Well, me," she answered.;   The result is
an annual "Black Nativity" production, performed by 47 singers from the temple
choir and a dance group.;   In this, the pageant's 10th year, it has expanded
to two weekends of performances and has traveled to Richmond and Sacramento.
Next year, the production has an invitation to perform at a church in San
Mateo.;   Gadling describes it as ideal for children and families. (It runs
about two hours and 15 minutes.) The first act tells the story of the Nativity
in song and dance. The second is a '40s revival meeting, led by a preacher
(Michael Johnson, who is a deacon at the temple).;   Why is it important?
"It's the only black thing of its kind," says Gadling. And Langston Hughes
wrote it.; Black Nativity; By Langston Hughes; Producer: Allen Temple Baptist

PRIZE LEFT-HANDER LANGSTON GRANTS AUDIENCE TO PADRES

<P>
Mark Langston, the free-agent left-handed starter who is being wooed by almost 
half of the teams in baseball, agreed Friday to a private meeting next week in 
Los Angeles with Padre Manager Jack McKeon when his agent opens negotiations 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Padres' Chicago-based attorney, is scheduled to travel in Los 
Angeles early next week and begin contract negotiations with agent Arn Tellem. 
In a separate meeting, Langston is scheduled to talk with McKeon, Tellem said, 
to discuss baseball philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Arn told me that Mark thinks very highly of Jack McKeon," Lane said, "and 
that's why he wants to meet him." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I look forward to talking to him, and as you know, I'd sure love 
to have him on our club." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 10 teams, Tellem said, that have expressed interest in 
Langston. Tellem will meet with most of them next week, but said there is no 
timetable as to when Langston will make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 29, who was born in San Diego and raised in the Bay Area, is expected 
to become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball. Those considered to be involved 
in heavy bidding besides the Padres are the Dodgers, Angels, St. Louis 
Cardinals, New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, San Francisco Giants and 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Who his top choice is depends on who you listen to. 
</P>
<P>
Many will tell you it's the Dodgers, considering that his wife is pursing an 
acting career. Others will tell you the Padres, because of the city. And some 
will say the Cardinals, with their spacious ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that he wants to play for a contender," Tellem said. 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I just hope it's us." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Padres begin negotiations with Langston, however, they hope to have 
their own free-agent pitcher -- left-handed reliever Mark Davis -- under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made a new proposal to Davis Friday, offering him a guaranteed 
three-year contract, sources said, for about $6 million. It would give Davis 
the most lucrative contract on the club, exceeding the $5.25 million for three 
years obtained last December by free-agent starter Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third offer the Padres have made to Davis since the season's 
conclusion, the second since Oct. 30, when Davis filed for free agency. It was 
made after Alan Hendricks, Davis' agent, telephoned Lane on Friday and said 
that they were looking for an increase from the Padres' last proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me, and he stated their position," Lane said, "and I stated our 
position. I then gave them a new proposal, and he said he will get back to me." 
</P>
<P>
Is Lane optimistic that Davis will accept the offer? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think they're going to do anything unless Mark decided 
they're going to do something. I don't think there's any reason for them not to 
take our proposal, but I still think they're inclined to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Teams can begin negotiations with free agents at 10 a.m. (PST) Monday. Davis 
will be in New York that day to receive his trophy as the Rolaids relief 
pitcher of the year in the National League, and Hendricks said he is sure there 
will be plenty of interest. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 84 players who have filed for free agency, no one figures to be paid 
as handsomely as Langston. Although his 86-76 career record hardly is dazzling, 
this is a pitcher who led the American League in strikeouts for three seasons 
while playing for the Seattle Mariners, who have never had a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was traded by the Mariners to Montreal on May 25 after rejecting a 
three-year, $7.1-million contract. He was 12-9 with a 2.39 ERA in four months 
with the Expos, but when they attempted to sign him, Langston reportedly turned 
down a three-year, $9 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
So just how much will it cost the Padres to sign Langston now? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Lane said, "that's what we're about to find out."

LANGSTON SOLID IN DEBUT FOR EXPOS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston was one of the best pitchers in the American League when he 
worked for the Seattle Mariners, but he often expressed dissatisfaction with 
the way he was treated there, and had requested a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who was acquired by the Montreal Expos Thursday for three pitching 
prospects, made his National League debut Sunday at San Diego, and both he and 
the Expos were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-throwing left-hander, who led the American League in strikeouts three 
times, struck out 12 in eight innings and pitched the Expos to a 10-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who didn't get a chance to hit at Seattle because of the designated 
hitter rule, also showed he knew how to handle a bat. He singled and drove in a 
run in the eighth. In his eight innings, he yielded only four hits and one 
earned run. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like my major league debut," Langston said. "Having been around awhile 
helped block out things. I definitely feel a part of this team already. I was 
afraid I might go out there and get bombed." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos made Langston feel welcome with a fine display of hitting. Tim Raines 
hit a three-run homer in the fifth inning to give him a 6-0 lead. Tim Wallach 
had three doubles and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the offensive explosion will make it a little easier to sign Langston, 
who is eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Philadelphia 5 -- Even a long hitting slump doesn't prevent 
the Giants from scoring runs when Rick Reuschel pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, 40, became the first nine-game winner in the majors although he 
lasted only 5 1/3 innings and the Giants managed just four hits at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hits was a grand slam by Will Clark in the fourth inning, and from 
then on it was downhill for the right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants matched their hit total by committing four errors, making two of the 
four runs Reuschel (9-2) allowed unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 9, Pittsburgh 2 -- If today wasn't Memorial Day, the Pirates would 
probably have declared it a holiday, anyway, because Glenn Davis finally left 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' first baseman just about destroyed the Pirates' pitching staff over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit a home run in each game to lead Houston to a three-game sweep. His 
three-run homer in the fifth inning in this one gave Mike Scott a 6-2 lead and 
it was a romp. 
</P>
<P>
He hit a two-run homer in the third inning of Friday night's 4-2 victory. 
Saturday, he hit a dramatic two-run home run with two out in the ninth to tie 
the game and the Astros won in the 12th, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has 12 home runs this season, has a lifetime average of .347 against 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (7-3) went a strong six innings to beat the Pirates for the fourth time 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Cincinnati 1 -- Mike Bielecki missed out on his shutout at Chicago, 
but he accomplished his primary goal -- beating the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had a 5-0 record against the right-hander, but except for the 
hot-hitting Chris Sabo, Bielecki had everyone under control. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki went the distance, giving up seven hits to improve his record to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo, after a brilliant start in 1988 as a rookie, cooled off and didn't hit a 
homer from early July to the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't show much power at the start of this season. But, when he spoiled 
Bielecki's shutout with a homer in the eighth, it gave him four in the last 
five games. 
</P>

The Blue Jays, held hitless for eight innings by Seattle's Mark Langston, 
rallied for three runs in the ninth today and beat the Mariners 3-2, with 
George Bell driving in the winning run with a bloop single off reliever Mike 
Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Langston had shackled the Blue Jays through the first eight innings, allowing 
only one baserunner, on shortstop Omar Vizquel's error in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Langston unraveled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lawless, pinch-hitting for Lloyd Moseby, led off the inning with a solid 
single to center, ending Langston's chance to become the first Seattle pitcher 
to hurl a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
After Nelson Liriano sacrificed Lawless to second, Bob Brenly, batting for Rob 
Ducey, doubled down the left field line, scoring Lawless and ending Langston's 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felix then tied the score 2-2 with an RBI single to center, driving in 
pinch-runner Alexis Infante. Felix went to second on the throw to the plate, 
and Langston was replaced by Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler retired Kelly Gruber on a grounder to third and intentionally walked 
Tony Fernandez to pitch to the slumping Bell.

PROTEST FROM POET'S ESTATE KEEPS FILM OUT OF GAY FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Horne could hardly contain his excitement at last winter's Berlin Gay and 
Lesbian Film Festival when he saw "Looking for Langston," director Isaac 
Julien's study of homosexuality during the Harlem Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered it the first black gay feature film ever made," said Horne, the 
director and founder of the seventh Los Angeles International Gay and Lesbian 
Film and Video Festival, which runs through Sunday at the Directors Guild of 
America Theater in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Horne, who has shown all of the London-based Julien's previous films, had 
decided to open the festival with "Looking for Langston," which deals with 
intimate bonds between gay blacks and whites. Langston Hughes' poetry is 
presented as a voice-over in parts of the movie. The black poet died in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"It would set the tone," Horne proclaimed, "of a festival that was shaped along 
the themes of multi-culturalism." 
</P>
<P>
But Horne's dream recently fell apart when Ada Griffin, director of the New 
York-based Third World Newsreel, the distributor of "Langston," called and 
demanded that he not show the film. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Julien in mid-June 
informing him that he would put Griffin, Horne's festival and himself in legal 
jeopardy if the film were screened. 
</P>
<P>
The cause for the crisis? Julien had secured the rights to quote Hughes' poetry 
in the film, but only for use in Britain. ("Langston" already has been shown on 
"Out on Tuesday," a gay series on Britain's Channel 4.) 
</P>
<P>
But according to Griffin, film maker Julien apparently wasn't aware of the 
resistance he would meet from the "black bourgeoisie" who, she feels, "see 
Hughes as a racial icon." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the estate) were appalled at any inference that Hughes might have been a 
homosexual and they wanted all mentions of him out," said Griffin from her New 
York office. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' sexuality has long been debated among academics. Lately, an acclaimed 
biography of Hughes' life by Arnold Rampersad, published by Oxford University 
Press, was unable to confirm that Hughes was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
However, the editors of "Gay and Lesbian Poetry of Our Time," published by St. 
Martin's Press, included four poems by Hughes in their anthology. 
</P>
<P>
Why the fuss then about "Langston"? 
</P>
<P>
According to Horne, "the power of celluloid is formidable, even if we're 
talking independent art films -- which is why I wanted to program this festival 
along multicultural themes." 
</P>
<P>
For Horne's part, "the absence of 'Langston' doesn't necessarily detract from 
the festival." Rather, he says that "the mess" points out how "much we still 
need gay and lesbian film festivals." 
</P>
<P>
Julien, who was contacted at his London production company, SanKoFa, seemed to 
take the pulling of the film from the festival in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hughes estate had four major points of contention: that we delete all of 
Hughes' poetry, all mention of the estate in the credits of the film and all 
excerpts of Hughes reading his poetry on NBC television, as well as pay for the 
estate's legal expenses in suing us. 
</P>
<P>
"We will delete the poetry," Julien said. "I want the film to get shown -- and 
the film isn't so much about Hughes as it's about 'looking' for cultural pride. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will not comply with deleting the NBC footage because that is part of 
the public domain. And even though we are trying our best to act in good faith 
with the estate, we will not go so far as to pay for their expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Harold Ober Associates, an agency that represents the Hughes 
estate, refused to comment on the legal or social implications of their 
cease-and-desist letter when questioned by The Times.

ANGELS SIGN PITCHER LANGSTON TO 5-YEAR, $16-MILLION CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bold move sure to send the skyrocketing price of baseball free agents even 
higher, the Angels today signed Mark Langston to a five-year contract worth $16 
million, making the 29-year-old left-hander the game's highest paid player. 
(Details, Page P10) 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who had a combined 16-14 record with the Mariners and Expos last 
season, got the longest contract awarded a player since the mid-1980s. Only 
Tuesday, Rickey Henderson broke the $3-million contract barrier when he 
re-signed with the World Champion Oakland A's for $12 million over four years. 
That was the first contract of that length since October, 1985, when Ken 
Oberkfell signed a four-year, $3-million agreement with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
This off-season, which promises to be the busiest free-agent market ever, has 
seen Bryn Smith leave Montreal to sign a $6-million, three-year deal with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, Kirby Puckett re-sign with the Minnesota Twins for $9 
million over three years and Pascual Perez sign with the New York Yankees for 
$5.7 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, a native of San Diego, had held discussions with the Dodgers and 
Yankees before signing with the already pitching-rich Angels. The staff last 
season had a collective earned-run average of 3.28, second-best in the American 
League.

LANGSTON SHUTS DOWN PADRES IN HIS EXPO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since last winter, the Padres had longed for the day when Mark Langston 
would pitch at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
That day finally came Sunday, but Langston was wearing the wrong uniform. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had done all they could to acquire the left-handed Langston, 28, who 
had been placed on sale by the Seattle Mariners because his $1.3-million-a-year 
contract will run out at the end of the season. But he wound up with the 
Montreal Expos Thursday in a deal for three young pitchers, and the Padres 
suffered the additional indignity of being the first National League team to 
face him. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-2 score by which the Expos humiliated the Padres only began to tell how 
dominant Langston was. He pitched one-hit ball for six innings, and didn't give 
up a run until his working margin had reached 8-0. He left after eight innings 
with a four-hitter and 12 strikeouts, and one of the two Padre runs was 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the Padres did a lot to embarrass themselves in front of a packed 
house of 48,023, lured in large measure by a postgame concert by the Beach 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching of Eric Show and Dave Leiper was a perfect match for the Padres' 
anemic hitting, and Leiper made a terrible situation worse with a throw to 
third base following a rundown that ranked with the wildest on record. 
</P>
<P>
Even a member of the Padre coaching staff got into the act. Sandy Alomar Sr., 
directing traffic at third base, put a fitting finish to the lamentable 
performance by sending Carmelo Martinez home from second base on Tim Flannery's 
single with the Padres eight runs behind. Martinez was an easy game-ending out. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Martinez summed things up by saying, "I hope the Beach Boys put on a 
better show." 
</P>
<P>
As Martinez suspected, the second half of the doubleheader was far more 
entertaining than the baseball game. Still, anyone with a keen eye for pitching 
had to be impressed by Langston. And anyone with the Padres' interests at heart 
had to wonder how good they would be if they had landed him. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Langston reached an impasse in contract negotiations with the 
Mariners, he had been the object of a manhunt that spread over both major 
leagues. Since he could have become a free agent this fall, the Mariners 
couldn't wait to unload him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Expos will lose Langston if they can't sign him, but as Manager 
Buck Rodgers put it, "We're going for it in '89. Anything after that will be a 
bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Since Langston is a native of San Diego -- he moved to Santa Clara at the age 
of 4 -- and has expressed displeasure over going to Montreal, there is still 
hope among Padre diehards that he will come here eventually. However, Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon is not among the optimists. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to think that if they're trying to win a pennant, he'll be with them 
quite a while," McKeon said. "Maybe if they're out of the race by September, we 
might see another deal, but I doubt if that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Of all people, the only San Diego player to get a hit off Langston in the first 
six innings was Show. The Padre pitcher took advantage of one of Langston's few 
mistakes by lining a double to right field in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Even on that count, though, Langston had the last laugh. This was the first 
time he had ever batted in the majors because of the designated-hitter rule 
used in the American League. And he got the first hit of his career -- also his 
first run batted in -- in his fourth and last time at bat. It was a single to 
center off Leiper. 
</P>
<P>
"That hit definitely made my day," Langston said. "It was a pretty wild 
experience. It looked pretty ugly. I was just trying to put the ball in play. 
Now I can put it on my mantel." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is a switch-hitter, and his hit came on his first swing batting 
right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
As for his pitching, he said, "I was really excited to be with a new team and 
with a big crowd. The guys went right out and scored some runs, so I could take 
a deep breath. We got the crowd out of it real early. It was my job to keep 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Langston probably could have finished without difficulty, but he said, "I was 
getting a little tired. I really didn't want to pitch the ninth, because I 
don't like to go over 130 pitches (He threw 138). If it had been a close game, 
it would have been different." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers offered a second reason for calling in closer Tim Burke, who has nine 
saves, to finish the game." 
</P>
<P>
"Burke hadn't worked in almost a week," Rodgers said. "I wanted to give him an 
inning to keep him sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Show (6-5) was gunning for a Padre record of 93 victories -- he is tied with 
Randy Jones -- but it became apparent in a hurry that he wasn't going to get 
it. He yielded one run in the second and two in the fourth, then served up a 
three-run homer to Tim Raines in the fifth. By that time, the frustrated fans 
were booing loudly and often. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach was the Expos' big bomber, tying a club record with three doubles. 
</P>
<P>
How good was Langston? Just ask some of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Flannery is a left-handed hitter who normally plays only against right-handed 
pitchers. But he was pressed into service because of Randy Ready's leg injury, 
and looked back on it as quite an experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Any left-hander is tough for me," Flannery said. "Even Jimmy Allen, our 
batting-practice pitcher, gives me trouble. But Langston is one of the toughest 
I've ever seen. He's always ahead of you, so you're always hitting 
defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark said, "He's like a left-handed Dwight Gooden. He's a great pitcher 
-- not a good one, a great one." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The 10 runs scored by the Expos set a season record for Padre opponents. The 
previous high was nine. Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "This was our first 
blowout all year." It came on the first anniversary of McKeon's debut as 
manager after the firing of Larry Bowa. . . . Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said 
the trade for Mark Langston couldn't have been made but for a surplus of talent 
in the Montreal farm system. "It's a tribute to our scouting and farm 
department that we've developed players other clubs want."

LANGSTON FINDS THE LOCAL AREA ATTRACTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A whirlwind trip to Los Angeles this week only seemed to confirm Mark 
Langston's feelings that he would like to make Southern California a more 
permanent stop when he leaves the Montreal Expos soon as a free-agent pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur musician who plays a number of instruments -- "and is master of 
none" -- Langston satisfied those interests Wednesday by jamming with a good 
friend, pop star Bruce Hornsby, in the garage of Hornsby's Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
And that night, Langston watched the Kings play the New York Islanders at the 
Forum, then met Wayne Gretzky, who brightened the moment for Langston by 
telling the pitcher that he was one of the first players Gretzky picked for his 
rotisserie league team. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't say how his team did, but he could soon be rooting for Langston 
on a home-team basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind that at all," Langston said Thursday when asked about the 
possibility of pitching for Gretzky's hometown Dodgers. "He would be a great 
guy to pal around with." 
</P>
<P>
A budding friendship isn't the only attraction for Langston in Los Angeles, but 
neither is he closing the door on other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible to file for free agency on the day after the World Series and having 
already rejected a three-year, $9-million offer from the Expos, Langston said 
he has eight teams in mind. 
</P>
<P>
They are the five California teams plus the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals 
and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said it is too early to rank the eight or pinpoint preferences, but he 
does favor Southern California, meaning the Dodgers, Angels or San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Arn Tellem said he expects Langston to emerge as baseball's highest-paid 
pitcher and player -- if only on the basis of competitive bidding and economic 
appreciation since Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers signed his three-year, 
$7.9-million contract last winter, and Frank Viola of the Minnesota Twins 
matched it in April before his trade to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, however, if the threat of a labor lockout or strike might not depress a 
market in which Langston looms as the most attractive commodity, Tellem shook 
his head and said: "For Mark and the other top free agents, I think it will be 
a very active market. I think the clubs will look on it as a window of 
opportunity, a chance to grab the top players before the labor problems develop 
next spring." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who made $1.3 million this season, said his decision will be based on 
baseball and financial considerations, the most important aspect being the 
competitiveness of the club. The Dodgers, Angels and Padres satisfy that 
criterion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be on a contending club, a club that has a chance to win," he said. 
"I really feel that if the Expos had won, it would have left a different taste 
with me. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say I've ruled out the possibility of re-signing with the Expos, 
but I would have definitely been more interested if we had won." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, a 29-year-old left-hander who led the American League in strikeouts 
in three of his five seasons with the Seattle Mariners, was traded to the Expos 
on May 25 and compiled an overall record of 16-14, winning 10 of his first 13 
decisions with Montreal before losing six of his last eight, thanks in large 
part to illness, injury and lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
His earned-run average of 2.39 was the National League's third best, and his 
overall strikeout total of 235 in 250 innings was second in the majors to Nolan 
Ryan's 301. 
</P>
<P>
Langston has pitched 225 innings or more in each of his six seasons except 
1985, when he had an elbow injury. And while pitching for the hapless Mariners 
in the confining Kingdome, he won 19 of his team's 78 games in 1987 and 15 of 
his team's 68 in 1988. His 17 wins in 1984 were the most by a rookie 
left-hander since Gary Peters won 19 for the 1963 Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, pursuing a "win now" philosophy, traded three young pitchers for 
Langston, knowing he might leave at the end of the season. Langston said he was 
treated well by Montreal fans and looked at his future in that city with an 
open mind -- at least until the final six weeks of a season in which he thought 
the Expos were rolling toward a division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as if someone pulled the plug," he said. "Everything crumbled and I 
don't know why. We lost seven in a row to the Cubs and Mets and I still had an 
open mind, but I wanted to see how we rebounded and we never did. The situation 
kept getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos could be devastated now by the departure of several free agents, 
including Langston and Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Both are Californians who want to return, although Langston, who grew up in 
Santa Clara, said he will maintain his winter home in Seattle, no matter where 
he signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from California, there would be a nice sense of coming home," he said. 
"And I've always felt that when you step on the field in Anaheim or at Dodger 
Stadium, there's a feeling that this is what the big leagues are all about. 
Plus, you don't hear a lot of negative things from the stands like you do in 
other parks. The fans come to be entertained, and generally are. The quality of 
the organizations speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Langston's wife, Michelle, has studied acting, and Langston said he has 
relatives in the San Diego area with whom he gets together two or three times a 
winter to attend basketball and hockey games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had fun here. We've always felt very comfortable here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does he have a preference to leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed the National League because I like to participate," he said. 
"I like to bat and run the bases. It brought back some boyhood memories. I even 
broke up a double play against the Cardinals. Jose Oquendo asked if I was all 
right, and I just laughed. It was fun again. 
</P>
<P>
"But I could also make an easy adjustment to the American League. I spent five 
years there. I know the league very well. I really don't think the question of 
leagues will be a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that it will be, that aside from participating more in the 
National League, Langston likes the idea of pitching to a lineup devoid of a 
designated hitter in a league where pitchers work fewer innings because they 
are apt to give way to pinch hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, refused to discuss 
Langston because of tampering restrictions. Sources close to the club believe 
Claire will pursue Langston as he did Dave Righetti and Gary Gaetti. 
</P>
<P>
Signing Langston would allow Claire to trade a young pitcher -- John Wetteland, 
perhaps -- for a center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels view Langston in a similar manner. "When you consider what we were 
prepared to pay Bruce Hurst and Nolan Ryan last winter, I'm confident we will 
be in the bidding for Langston," a club executive said. "We had a surprisingly 
good season but realize we have to build on it. We can't stand pat, 
particularly when you consider the quality of the opposition."

<P>
A million for your thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Mark Langston and the Angels, we have 16 more . . . 
</P>
<P>
1. Seattle and Montreal combined, Langston was 16-14 for 1989. Ten years 
earlier, Nolan Ryan had the same record for the Angels -- and all that got him 
was a new uniform and Buzzie Bavasi's immortal epithet: "We can replace him 
with a couple of 8-7 pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
2. Mike Witt was also a 16-14 free agent in 1987 before the Angels decided to 
keep their Witt about them for two more years. Total price tag: $2.8 million -- 
or about what Langston will have cleared by next Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
3. The inflation, of course, is insane, but would any of this have been 
necessary if Bavasi had deemed Ryan worth keeping in 1979? As they used to say 
in the commercial, you can pay me now . . . or you can pay me later. 
</P>
<P>
4. In 1990, Langston will bid to become the first Angel pitcher to lead the 
league in strikeouts since you-know-who in 1979. Langston's main challenger? 
You know who. 
</P>
<P>
5. The Angels have just about cornered the American League market on 
left-handed starting pitchers. In Langston and Chuck Finley, they have the two 
best. And in a few years, Jim Abbott could make it a top-three sweep. 
</P>
<P>
6. Then again, we know about the Angels' luck with free-agent pitchers. Bruce 
Kison, the first attempt at replacing Ryan, was 3-6 in 1980. John D'Acquisto 
was 0-0 with a 10.71 ERA in 1981. Bill Travers was 0-3 with a 5.91 ERA in 1983. 
Frank LaCorte was 1-2 with a 7.06 ERA in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the Angels finally worked up enough courage to try it again. 
And, they needed every minute. 
</P>
<P>
7. Did somebody mention rotator cuff? Not funny, not funny at all. 
</P>
<P>
8. That's the number of games the Angels finished behind Oakland last season. 
In 1989, Langston won seven more games than the man he might replace in the 
Angel rotation, Mike Witt. Still not enough. 
</P>
<P>
9. But the gap could continue to narrow this week in Nashville, this year's 
site for baseball's winter swap meet. Does the name Joe Carter ring a bell? If 
the Angels are unable to pull a new-age Robin Hood on Robin Yount -- take from 
the rich and give to the rich -- look for the Angels to zero in on the 
Cleveland hammer, the Jose Canseco of Lake Erie. Minus the hotline. 
</P>
<P>
With Langston in tow, the Angels finally have some cards to play. But with 
Boston reportedly offering Mike Greenwell, straight-up, for Carter, the Indians 
aren't likely to settle for any discards. A starting pitcher -- say, Witt or 
Kirk McCaskill -- and a regular player -- maybe even Devon White -- may have to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-duty stuff, yes. But with Langston, the Angels are allowed the luxury of 
thinking big for the first time in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
10. First Bert Blyleven and now Langston. If the Angels can't beat 'em, the 
plan is to take 'em out of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Before his mid-summer trade from Seattle to Montreal, Langston was 2-0 against 
the Angels last season -- including a 7-0 shutout in Abbott's big league debut. 
That duplicated Langston's record against California in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the only time Angel hitters will have to face Langston is during 
batting practice at spring training. For the next five years that much is 
guaranteed. Somewhere, Jack Howell is sleeping easier. 
</P>
<P>
11. OK, let's stack them up. The Athletics' top five starters vs. the Angels' 
top five. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart vs. Langston? Push. Mike Moore vs. Finley? Slight edge to A's. Bob 
Welch vs. Blyleven? Slight edge to Angels. Storm Davis vs. McCaskill? Solid 
edge to Angels. Todd Burns vs. Abbott? Edge to Angels again. 
</P>
<P>
This being a happy time for the Angels, we'll save the outfield and infield 
matchups for later. 
</P>
<P>
12. Langston's number with the Mariners and the Expos. With the Angels, Doug 
Rader wears it. Wonder who's going to have to give it up? 
</P>
<P>
13. Lance Parrish's number. Don't forget him, Mike Port. Langston's a nice new 
toy, but in this case, a battery is not necessarily included. 
</P>
<P>
14. Finally, the Angels got an arm up on the Dodgers. In the only Freeway 
Series that matters, the Angels swept aside their inferiority complex to the 
north and won the Langston sweepstakes in a walk. Port 1, Fred Claire 0. 
</P>
<P>
15. Wonder what Wally Joyner thinks about those 16 million dollars. Two more 
years and Wally gets to go for the free-agent gold. And he's in the lineup 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
16. Will the last pitcher out of Montreal please take the flag? First Pascual 
Perez, then Bryn Smith and now Langston -- all in one week. Is there anyone 
left in the Montreal rotation? John Candelaria? Kevin Gross? Steve Rogers? 
</P>
<P>
Now we know why they're called the Ex-pos.

<LEADPARA>  Mark Langston will not be the American League's starting pitcher tonight at
the SkyDome, which is just fine with him. After what he went through last
year, just being an All-Star is enough.;    The former San Jose State pitcher
signed a five-year, $16-million contract to join the California Angels for the
1990 season. He went 10-17, and although the Angels scored only 18 runs in
those losses, he was seen as another free-agent flop.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AFTER BEING LABELED A BUST, LANGSTON ENJOYS
BOOM YEAR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  All-Star Game Preview  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     After this half-season, Langston has begun to justify the expenditure. He
is 12-3, winning two more games than he ever had by an All-Star break. He has
pitched into the seventh inning or later in 15 of his past 17 starts and has
teamed with Chuck Finley to lead California into contention. Why the dramatic
change?;    "Just having a very good team to play for has helped," Langston
said Monday. "We have a different team than last year. We have Dave Winfield
for a whole year, Wally Joyner is healthy and doing well, and we picked up
Gary Gaetti at third base.;    "Defensively, we're extremely sound. We have
the bats to keep us close, and the bullpen, with (All-Star teammate) Bryan
Harvey, has been outstanding. That's all helped.";    Langston spent most of
his career as a bright spot on a bad Seattle team. He made the All-Star team
in 1987, finishing that season with 262 strikeouts in 272 innings. He was
traded to Montreal in May 1989 for Randy Johnson, Brian Holman and Gene
Harris, and he bolted for big money and a big market after that season.;   
Langston began his Angels career by teaming with Mike Witt to throw a
no-hitter, but it went all downhill from there. "I lost four games in a row,
2-1," he said. "Then I got beat around pretty badly and lost confidence. I had
made my living being an offensive, aggressive pitcher, and I lost that. I
tried to pick my spots, and I fell behind in counts.";    Through it all,
Langston never threw so much as a tantrum. He never kicked a water cooler. "To
me, he's an All-Star two years in a row," Angels Manager Doug Rader said. "Not
necessarily from a performance standpoint, but from a character standpoint."; 
  Longtime rival Kirby Puckett of Minnesota said of Langston: "There's nothing
any different about him that I've seen. You just try to make him get the ball
down.";    Langston and Finley each have 12 victories, tying Minnesota's Scott
Erickson for the league lead. At this rate, Langston could have his first
20-win season. He won 19 games in '87, a Seattle record.;    "You can win 30
games, but if your team doesn't get into the playoffs, it doesn't really
matter," he said. "I felt I had a legitimate chance with Montreal. We were in
first for 2 1/2 months before folding, and I still think we had the best team.
Now, even though it's a tough division, we're in a very good position.";   
Langston has come a long way in a season, and a long way since he left defunct
Buchser High School in Santa Clara. He was offered plenty of soccer
scholarships, but there was not much interest in him as a baseball player. His
heart said baseball, and he said Monday with a rich man's grin, "It was the
right decision.";    "I had a good time at San Jose State," he said. "The main
thing there was just that the competition was up a little bit. It was a lot of
fun, and it sent me on my way."  </TEXT>

PADRES FIRE NEW PITCH TO DAVIS 
</P>

<P>
The Padres, in hopes that reliever Mark Davis forgets all about this free-agent 
business, offered him a new contract proposal Tuesday, one which they believe 
will convince him to remain in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting their answer, the Padres went ahead Tuesday and contacted Arn 
Tellem, the agent for free-agent pitcher Mark Langston, informing him that they 
will pursue the left-handed starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in him," said Chicago attorney Fred Lane, who will 
conduct the negotiations for the Padres, "and I think they're very interested 
in us." 
</P>
<P>
Lane, who along with La Jolla attorney Beth Benes is conducting the Davis 
negotiations for the Padres, said however that the Padres' first priority in 
the free-agent market continues to be Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a left-hander who saved a Padre-record 44 games in 1989 and was selected 
as The Sporting News' National League pitcher of the year, filed for free 
agency Monday night. But before Davis' agent, Alan Hendricks, even had a chance 
to test the marketplace, the Padres had a new contract proposal awaiting 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We had already made them a fabulous offer, but we made them even a more 
fabulous offer after we learned that they filed for free agency," Lane said. 
"We wanted to give Mark something to think about. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Mark to know that we're very sincere, and how much the Padres want 
him. He knows that from our words. And now he knows that from our numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Lane refused to reveal the Padres' offer, saying, "I don't want to educate my 
competition," but it is believed that it is a three-year guaranteed contract 
for at least $7 million with possibly an option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was unaware of the Padres' new offer Tuesday. Hendricks, his agent, was 
undergoing foot surgery, Davis said, but he's expected to speak with him today 
and discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to San Diego is still my first choice," Davis said. "Just because 
I filed for free agency doesn't mean that I'm not even thinking about San 
Diego, that's far from my intention. I just want to protect myself." 
</P>
<P>
Davis would not disclose how much it will take for the Padres to keep him, but 
said that he's seeking a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"A contract for more than three years is something I'd definitely like," Davis 
said. "I know they're not common, but it's something I think a team and a 
player could work out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lane: "We can probably work out anything, but we don't want to do 
something nuts. I'm certain everything will work out. We're going to get him; 
we're going to get him. 
</P>
<P>
"This offer is something that'll be so attractive to him that he'll have to 
take it now." 
</P>
<P>
And if Davis and Hendricks continue to explore the possibilities of the 
free-agent market? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in that case," Lane said, "I'll just hope he's not interested in the 
teams that are interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
While in the marketing mood Tuesday, the Padres officially launched their claim 
in the Langston sweepstakes. They are considered to be among Langston's top 
three choices, along with the Dodgers and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how much it will cost to lure Langston to the Padres, but 
it's almost certain that he will become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, 
exceeding $3 million a year. The Padres, and every other team with the 
exception of the Montreal Expos, are not allowed to negotiate with Langston or 
discuss monetary terms until after Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are successful in acquiring Langston, 12-9, 2.39 ERA, they would 
enter the 1990 season with perhaps the strongest pitching rotation in the 
National League: Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, Eric Show, Andy Benes and Langston. 
It also would enable them to package one or two pitchers along with a catcher 
to obtain a starting center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also could be in the market for other free agents, such as 
outfielder Hubie Brooks and first baseman Keith Hernandez, but have yet to 
decide if they'll pursue any others besides Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have to sit down, get a list together, and discuss just who fits our 
needs," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice president, player personnel. "It's quite 
obvious we can't sign everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, they'd be ecstatic just to sign a certain pair of left-handers.

LANGSTON TRADE AGAIN PAYS DIVIDENDS FOR EXPOS 
</P>

<P>
When the Montreal Expos decided that Mark Langston was the pitcher they needed 
to contend in the National League East, they were willing to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
They sent three promising pitchers to the Seattle Mariners for the 
hard-throwing left-hander. There has not been a moment that the Expos have 
regretted the move. 
</P>
<P>
While Randy Johnson, Brian Holman and Gene Harris have potential, Langston has 
pitched the Expos into first place. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Montreal, Langston struck out 10 and gave up only five hits in 
a 2-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who has three shutouts in his 12 starts for Montreal, improved to 8-3 
as an Expo. 
</P>
<P>
When Langston made his Montreal debut May 28, the Expos were in fourth place 
with a 23-24 record. They are 36-17 since he joined them and lead the division 
by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
"He has given us even more than we hoped he would," Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
"He has given us a chance to win every game he's started. There are times when 
nobody pitches any better." 
</P>
<P>
Even in his three defeats, Langston pitched at least six innings. In eight of 
his other nine, he has not given up more than one earned run. In the other, he 
gave up three runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to get runs," Langston said, "but it's probably better for me if we 
don't score too many. In close games I tend to concentrate more and make more 
of my pitches count. When it's close, you have to have an idea of what you want 
every pitch to do before you throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, St. Louis 2 -- The Cubs, who are becoming the Expos' chief 
challenger, ended Joe Magrane's six-game winning streak, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kilgus (6-9), who had not won since June 6, worked six innings and singled 
in a run. The Cub bullpen finished up for Kilgus. Mitch Williams pitched the 
last two innings, gave up a run and took over the league lead with his 25th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Oquendo of the Cardinals had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 23 
games, longest in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane (11-7) gave up six hits and three runs in seven innings. He struck out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Atlanta 4 -- Robby Thompson hit a home run and the Giants won 
their second in a row at Atlanta, handing the Braves their sixth consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Mike LaCoss (5-6) worked seven innings and Craig Lefferts earned his 18th save. 
Ed Whited hit a two-run home run in the ninth for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, New York 2 -- Bobby Bonilla singled in the tie-breaking run in 
the eighth inning at New York, ending the Mets' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff King led off the ninth against loser Rick Aguilera (6-4) with his first 
major league home run. Bill Landrum worked the bottom of the ninth for his 14th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Drabek, who fell to 8-7: "I don't think I've ever won on my birthday 
before, except once in the minors. It was exciting to beat this club." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat dropped the Mets into third place, behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Met Manager Davey Johnson: "We know we're not going to win them all. 
There's still a lot of baseball left. We've played well. That's all I'm 
concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 6, Cincinnati 2 -- As the injuries continue to mount for the Reds, so 
do the the defeats. Eric Davis joined the long list of injured players and 
missed this game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had lost four in a row at home to the Cardinals last weekend, 
handed the Reds their ninth consecutive defeat and 13th in their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson, enjoying his finest season, improved to 14-6. The victories match 
his career high in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton singled in two runs in the fourth and Shawn Abner hit a 
three-run home run in the seventh to back Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, the Reds put left-hander Danny Jackson on the disabled list 
because of a shoulder injury. Jackson, a 23-game winner last season, is 6-11 
and has an earned-run average of 5.60. DAN HAFNER

<LEADPARA>  The California Angels think Mark Langston, the left-hander they signed to a
five-year, $16 million contract last year, is going to bounce back strongly
from his 17-loss season in 1990.;    So does Langston.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LANGSTON HELPS ANGELS TO SERIES SWEEP
HE PITCHES SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  A.L. ROUNDUP  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Langston took a step in that direction Thursday when he pitched six strong
innings in a 5-0 victory over his old team, the Seattle Mariners.;    The
victory allowed the Angels, an 80-82 team last season, to sweep the Mariners
in the season-opening, three-game series. It also gave the Angels their best
start since going 5-0 in 1970.;    "He didn't doubt himself last year," Angels
Manager Doug Rader said of Langston. "It's important for anybody to get off to
a good start just simply because it's something to be proud. If he were going
to self destruct, it certainly would have been last year. It wouldn't have
been for an unsuccessful debut in 1991.";    A year ago, Langston was one of
the biggest free-agent flops in baseball, going 10-17 with a 4.40 ERA. His
only highlight came in his debut, exactly a year ago, when he pitched seven
innings against Seattle and combined with Mike Witt in the first of baseball's
record nine no-hitters.;    In Thursday's game, Dave Winfield drove in three
runs for the second straight game. He had a two-run double in the seventh.;   
"It takes a lot of pressure off of you when you've got the runs," Langston
said. "Dave had a really big hit. It gave us a really big lift.";    Langston
gave up a two-out single to Ken Griffey Jr. in the first inning and then
retired 13 straight Mariners before Dave Valle opened the sixth with a
single.;    Langston was lifted when the Mariners loaded the bases on singles
by Edgar Martinez and Griffey and a walk to Alvin Davis. But Jeff Robinson
came in and got the next three outs.;    Robinson got Jay Buhner to foul out
to first baseman Wally Joyner, Pete O'Brien to pop out to shortstop Dick
Schofield and struck out pinch hitter Greg Briley. He retired the Mariners in
order in the eighth and ninth for a save.;    "You can't read too much this
early," Langston said. "But it's very encouraging. It's outstanding to be able
to come in here and take three from probably their three best pitchers.";
INDIANS 6, RED SOX 4: Brook Jacoby drove in three runs and Cleveland spoiled
Danny Darwin's debut in Boston.;    Eric King blanked Boston on three hits
over six innings before tiring and needing relief help in a three-run seventh.
Doug Jones pitched the ninth for his second save.;    Darwin, signed for $11.8
million as a free agent after leading the National League in ERA last season
for Houston, was unimpressive in his first start for the Red Sox.;    The
Indians rocked Darwin for three runs in the first inning and added three more
in the second, the last two coming on Jacoby's wind-blown triple off reliever
Tom Bolton.; BLUE JAYS 7, BREWERS 3: Off-season acquisitions Devon White and
Joe Carter continued to spark the offense and David Wells pitched eight strong
innings as host Toronto beat Milwaukee.;    Carter, acquired from San Diego,
drove in two runs, giving him five in four games while batting .400 for the
Blue Jays. White, traded by California, went 3 for 5 and scored three runs,
giving him five for the season to go with a .389 average.;    Wells (1-0), who
has never pitched a complete game in 28 career starts, allowed three runs on
eight hits, struck out two and walked one.; TIGERS 11, YANKEES 5: Cecil
Fielder drove in three runs and scored four times as Detroit beat visiting New
York.;    Travis Fryman also had three RBIs for Detroit, and Roberto Kelly
drove in a career-high five runs for the Yankees.;    Fielder, who led the
majors last season with 51 homers and 132 RBIs, singled home two runs in the
seventh and drove in another with a fielder's choice grounder in the eighth.  </TEXT>

WITH 10 DRAFT PICKS, EXPOS HAVE CHANCE TO DOMINATE THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Expos were dejected and depleted last winter when Hubie Brooks, Mark 
Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez left the organization as free agents. 
They lost one of their leading run-producers and three starting pitchers and 
had nothing to show for it. That changes Monday, when the draft offers Montreal 
the chance to reload. The Expos hold 10 of the first 53 picks. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal has two picks in the first round (including one from the Angels, who 
signed Langston), four picks in a supplemental round immediately after the 
first round (one each for losing Langston, Brooks and Perez and one because 
they failed to sign their first-round pick from last year), and four more in 
the second round (their own pick plus one each for losing Brooks, Perez and 
Smith). 
</P>
<P>
"We have the chance to really do well," said Gary Hughes, Montreal's director 
of scouting. "Usually you only have two picks among the quality players in the 
first two rounds. Now we've got 10. There's a much better chance to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, which has already signed and developed all of its starting eight 
except for shortstop Spike Owen, has a chance to become a dominant team for the 
1990s. But then, we've heard such talk before. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos drafted Ellis Valentine and Gary Carter in 1972 and took Bill 
Gullickson, Scott Sanderson and Tim Raines in 1977. Then, in 1979, they won 95 
games in what was the franchise's first winning season. They were expected to 
be the team of the '80s but won only one title in the decade, and that was in 
the fractured strike season, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Expos are coming off two straight .500 seasons and are considered such 
an unattractive franchise that although it is up for sale, no one is bidding 
for it. If nothing else, 10 of the first 53 picks of the draft give Montreal 
reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're going in the right direction," Hughes said. "What good has free 
agency done Kansas City or California, anyway? We haven't had much success in 
attracting or keeping free agents. But if we build a successful organization, 
people will want to stay and people will want to come." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the team that could be hurt most by Montreal's abundance of picks 
is the New York Yankees. George Bradley, the Yankees' vice president of player 
personnel and development, explained that the Expos are likely to take players 
the Yankees covet. 
</P>
<P>
"Montreal scouts in basically the same way we do," Bradley said. "They're 
nearly identical to us. More so than any other club. That's why, after the 
first round at least, all of their picks are probably going to cost us some 
players. They're just like us in that they go for good athletes, younger 
players, they're not afraid to take chances and they may go for a kid who is 
regarded as tough to sign. We're very, very similar." 
</P>
<P>
A's may pick more winners -- Here is some bad news for all the teams who are 
trying to catch up with Oakland: The world champion Athletics, who built the 
core of their team through the draft, have seven of the first 66 selections 
Monday. Oakland obtained five extra picks as compensation for losing free 
agents Dave Parker, Storm Davis and Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to lose those players, but this is the way the system works," 
said Dick Bogard, Oakland's director of scouting. "I love it. We know we're 
going to get some good players. Throughout the system, our biggest need is 
pitching. We're looking to address that in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Glory is fleeting -- On Friday night, the Phillies reached first place for the 
first time since June 29, 1984. The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia 
Daily News both played the story on Page One. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to get to .500 and then build on that," said Von Hayes, the 
only player left from that 1984 team. "Now that we're in first, it's the same 
principle. Little by little, we want to pick up some games and build on our 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies lost the next night and dropped out of first place. They lost 
their next two games after that, too, to fall 2 1/2 games out. 
</P>
<P>
But give General Manager Lee Thomas credit for unloading three established 
Phillies -- Steve Bedrosian, Juan Samuel and Chris James -- within a 15-day 
span last June in order to get Charlie Hayes, Dennis Cook, Terry Mulholland, 
Roger McDowell, Lenny Dykstra, John Kruk and Randy Ready. All three of the 
deals look like steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' pitching is still too inexperienced and inconsistent for this 
team to win the National League East. But it appears Philadelphia will be a 
factor in the race for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think teams can afford to say anymore, 'Oh, we're playing the 
Phillies' and count on wins," reliever McDowell said. "I don't see September as 
a time when we'll be playing out the string." 
</P>
<P>
Call them F Troop -- McDowell said of the Phillies' turnover: "We're just a 
bunch of misfits. This team is a co-op. We're like the Miami Marlins. We're 
just a group of guys who like to play baseball but didn't have the chance to 
play every day. Look around here. We've got guys from Houston, San Francisco, 
San Diego, Minnesota, the Mets. . . . It's a situation where we feel we can 
play a little bit, no matter what anybody else says." 
</P>
<P>
Said Leyva: "Yeah, we've got some castoffs. I call them F Troop."

MIKE DOWNEY: MARK HIS WORD, ANGELS TO BE TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a man who's worth more money than most Anaheim savings and loans, Mark 
Langston still seems a fairly down-to-earth chap. Oh, he looks spiffy enough in 
his wild wide-striped suit and purplish shoes that resemble something Jack 
Nicholson's Joker might wear, and his glamorous wife keeps a diamond on her 
finger that is larger than Anaheim Stadium, but what the heck, when you got it, 
flaunt it. What should these people do -- wear blue jeans ripped at the knee? 
</P>
<P>
Langston looks sharp, feels sharp and talks a good game, too. He wants not to 
make waves, even this close to the ocean. Says he's glad to be an Angel, glad 
to be where it's warm, glad to be making what he's making no matter how much 
more Mark Davis or Robin Yount or anybody else in baseball's Billionaire Boys 
Club eventually commands, and says he's glad to be playing his home games on 
real grass for a change, even though "I'm a pitcher, so I'm always in the dirt 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Outspoken? Not particularly. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest limb Langston ventured onto, at his welcoming party Friday at the 
Big A, was his description of the Angels as "the team to beat" in the American 
League West next season, even with the Oakland Athletics having been to 
back-to-back World Series. That one raised a couple of eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Langston explains that he and his off-season next-door neighbor, A's outfielder 
Dave Henderson, have been chatting over the back fence about Oakland's need to 
fill voids left by Storm Davis on the mound and Dave Parker in the batter's box 
and clubhouse, which in turn has led Langston to this startling conclusion: 
"The Angels definitely figure to be the front-runners going into the season." 
</P>
<P>
Just wait'll Jose Canseco hears that. Be sure to dial 1-900-JOSE, or whatever 
his number is, any time next week, because Canseco probably will be picking the 
Angels to finish seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, though, this is neither controversy nor conceit on Langston's 
part. It's enthusiasm. It's a mind-set taking hold. This is Mark Langston 
already getting into the proper mood for the season, getting himself into a 
suitable frame of mind after toiling for ballclubs that stayed away from 
pennant races as though they had incentive bonuses in their contracts not to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very poor loser," Langston makes a point of saying and later repeating. 
</P>
<P>
He mentions how he gave a great deal of thought to signing a long-term deal 
with the Montreal Expos in the middle of last season, soon after they sent 
three pitchers to the Seattle Mariners on May 25 just to be able to rent him. 
Then something happened to unsettle Langston. 
</P>
<P>
As he recalls: "We hit a skid where we lost seven games in a row, or something 
like that, and I was anxious to see how the team would bounce back. Well, we 
didn't bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
That indicated to him something about the club, about its hunger to win. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing at Seattle. Langston ran into the new owner of the Mariners the 
other day, liked his upbeat attitude, told him it was "too bad he hadn't bought 
the team sooner, because things would be very different right now." 
</P>
<P>
Might he have signed to stay put, had Seattle had more generous management? 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have signed," Langston said. "I'm just very glad that I 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Spike Owen and I used to talk about it almost nightly in Montreal, why we 
never could win when we were in Seattle together. All you have to do is look 
around the league to understand it. Look at the Oakland A's -- half the team's 
ex-Mariners. You could fill an All-Star team with the players Seattle has let 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Since Langston is eager to please, he answers affirmatively when someone from 
the West Coast asks him if the biggest factor in his free agency was playing 
for a team on the West Coast. As a native Californian, Langston hardly minded 
saying yes. Trouble is, it's untrue. It's a little white lie, no harm intended. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is a pitcher who just finished saying how he nearly signed with 
Montreal, or would have stayed in Seattle, given the money. He negotiated with 
the New York Yankees, with the Chicago Cubs, with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast, schmest coast. Langston was out for three things: major loot, a 
no-trade guarantee and a five-year warranty. The Angels obliged. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston cost Wayne Gretzky $11 when Gretzky bought his fantasy-league 
baseball team. He cost the Angels $15,999,989 more. 
</P>
<P>
After the Angels outbid seven or eight other teams for the pitcher's services, 
a friend ran into Gretzky at a hockey game. First thing Gretzky said was: 
"Langston!" He was excited. And, as it turns out, the admiration society is 
mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a huge fan of his," Langston says of Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have certain things in common, not the least of which is a wife 
with a show-biz career. Michelle Langston, much like Janet Jones, has an acting 
career to consider, although Gretzky's lady already has been in several films, 
whereas Langston's wife is a beginner who has merely been taking acting classes 
for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Autry already has introduced me to some of her friends in the 
business," Michelle Langston said of the Angel owner's wife Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Any specific interests? 
</P>
<P>
"Daytime TV," she said. "A soap would be perfect. It would be nice to have the 
nights free." 
</P>
<P>
After all, there will be baseball to watch in the nighttime. The Angels open 
the season April 9 against -- well, what do you know? -- the Seattle Mariners, 
and even if Bert Blyleven works opening night, you can bet Mark Langston won't 
be far behind. Langston says he doesn't care who's No. 1 or No. 2 or No. 5, 
except that some guys who are told they are No. 5 tend to believe it, and pitch 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
He does have one worry. One big concern. This Blyleven character, he gives 
people hotfoots. He's dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I had nightmares that Bert Blyleven was going to be underneath this 
podium, with a match," Langston said, during his opening remarks. "That's why I 
wore shoes without laces, so he couldn't get me." 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that," said Blyleven, who was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my shoe company to get me some with non-flammable shoelaces," Langston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make 'em!" Blyleven shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, with $16 million in the bank, if you want non-flammable shoelaces, 
somebody out there will make you non-flammable shoelaces.

PADRES LONG FOR LANGSTON; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD NEWS IN MIDST OF 6-4 LOSS IS THAT HE LIKES THEM, TOO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In midst of the Padres' 6-4 defeat Saturday night to the Montreal Expos, Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon could not resist taking a longing glance at the guy sitting 
across the diamond in the home dugout at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He's a California native, with blond hair, blue eyes, 6-feet-2, 190 pounds. The 
most appealing aspect of his appearance to McKeon, though, is his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
He's got one of the best in the business, and is quite capable of turning any 
contender into a champion. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
He's eligible for free agency at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
And the Padres want him. 
</P>
<P>
They want him bad. 
</P>
<P>
Shhh. You've got to keep it a secret now. It's a baseball rule that no club is 
allowed to talk about their desire for another team's potential free agent. 
It's called tampering. 
</P>
<P>
"There are heavy fines for that," Padre General Manager Tony Siegle said, "and 
I don't feel like shelling out money." 
</P>
<P>
But behind closed-doors, in private conversations while talking about their 
plans for 1990, the Padres have come to the conclusion that Langston is the man 
who could lead them to the top of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
And you know what? 
</P>
<P>
Langston revealed Saturday that the Padres could also fit into his plans. He 
told a Padre player Friday that it's unlikely that he'll return to Montreal 
next season and revealed to a reporter Saturday that the Padres indeed are 
among the handful of teams he'd be interested in playing for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the man who is the most-coveted free agent in baseball just could be 
wearing Padre pinstripes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here, it's a nice city and everything," Langston said, "but it's 
different. I don't know how to explain it, it's just different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from California, and everyone knows I'd like to play on the west coast one 
day. We'll just have to wait and see whether it's next year." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, born in San Diego and raised in Santa Clara, reportedly has been 
offered a three-year, $9 million contract by the Expos, with incentives that 
could be worth $11 million. But he indicated Saturday that he likely would not 
make a decision on the contract until after the season, which would also allow 
him time to test the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came over here," said Langston, traded from Seattle on May 25, "I told 
myself I wouldn't be distracted by this. I went through all that in Seattle, 
and it didn't do me any good. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm just going to sit back and wait to see what happens. When I get time, 
I'll sit down and go over it (the contract), but not until then. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably will be after the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, understandably, were delighted to hear Langston's revelations. 
While McKeon could only smile, knowing the ramifications of discussing other 
club's free agents, the Padres freely showed their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to show up early for the game tomorrow," Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn said, "because I want to know the scoop. I want to know just what he's 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be awesome if we could get him. I know there are good pitchers all 
around the league, and I don't want to belittle this staff, but there's nobody 
like this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Padres could also use more help than just a pitcher, with particular 
need for a starting shortstop and center fielder, McKeon says, but if nothing 
else, this season has proven has proven that the Padres' starting rotation is 
woefully thin. 
</P>
<P>
Take away Ed Whitson (14-9, 2.72 ERA) and Bruce Hurst (12-9, 2.98 ERA) and 
look, if you dare, at the numbers compiled by the rest of the staff in their 72 
starts: 
</P>
<P>
They own a 23-35 record and 4.85 ERA. They've allowed 476 hits, 245 runs (217 
earned) and 143 walks, yielding a whopping 13.8 baserunners per nine innings 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get on our pitching staff," Gwynn said, "because we've had our 
problems in all phases of the game. But experience is a big part of this game, 
and lack of it on the mound has just killed us." 
</P>
<P>
Take Saturday night, for instance. Greg Harris, making just his seventh 
big-league start, was provided the lead in the fifth when the Padres scored 
three runs, including Mike Pagliarulo's first National League home run, for a 
4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Harris (5-7) came to the mound, yielded a single, two walks, a passed ball and 
a balk, and just like that, the Expos had a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do that and expect to win," said Harris, who allowed eight hits and 
six earned runs in 4 1/3 innings. "The thing that hurts is not so much 
performance but that I let them right back in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pitched poorly, and I let the team down." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, McKeon said, Harris is best-suited for the bullpen. McKeon says that 
he's the perfect setup man for bullpen stopper Mark Davis, and having him 
return to the bullpen would allow Mark Grant to be a middle man once again. 
</P>
<P>
You get the picture now why the Padres lust after Langston, who's 10-3 with a 
1.91 ERA since joining the Expos? 
</P>
<P>
"I really believed we were the team to beat," Gwynn said, "but now I think 
we're going to fall a little bit short. He could push us to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still a good team, and we ain't far, we ain't far away at all, but to be 
honest we're lucky to be 10 games out. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before this trip that it was make or break for us. And now that we've 
lost four out of five, well, we're not showing people we want to win this 
thing. It's like we've reverted back to our old ways. 
</P>
<P>
"What have we got, 39 games left? To win it, I think we'd have to win 35. 
That's not likely to happen, but that doesn't mean we can't be a team to be 
reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Padres were the preseason favorite and are 10 games behind the 
San Francisco Giants with a 60-63 record, it would be quite understandable if 
the Padre front office is a little shy about assuming another huge contract. 
</P>
<P>
They acquired first baseman Jack Clark and his $2 million salary. They obtained 
free-agent pitcher Bruce Hurst, who signed a three-year, $5.25 million 
contract. And now to get Langston, well, it could cost at least $8 million over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing," Gwynn said. "Once we got those guys, the payroll went 
through the sky. And like we proved this year, it's not just about going out 
and getting guys. There are more things that come to play if we're going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong. I'd love for us to go out and get Langston and trade for 
(Cincinnati center fielder) Eric Davis because that would enhance our chance of 
winning. You just know that Langston could win 20 games very easily, and 
everyone knows what kind of player Eric Davis is. 
</P>
<P>
"But to get those guys means money. And if guys start coming in making big 
money, the guys that are here will want money, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting, real interesting. But my God, can you imagine what it'd 
be like to have a pitcher like that on our staff? Oh, man." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn said he fully expects to be back in right field 
at the end of the season, instead of center field, where he has started 77 
times this season. "I don't think they look at me as a center fielder," he 
said. "I think this is just a stop-gap thing. I'll be back in right next year." 
. . . Padre catcher Mark Parent's next start likely will be this afternoon 
since starting Benito Santiago usually is given day games off.

NUMBERS RIGHT FOR LANGSTON;

<P>
ANGELS: NEW PITCHER SIGNS $16-MILLION CONTRACT, TAKES NO. 12 OFF BACK OF 
MANAGER DOUG RADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky paid $11.10 to get left-hander Mark Langston. The Angels had to 
give Langston $16 million and the shirt off Doug Rader's back. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, an avid baseball fan, got Langston's services at a bargain rate for 
his rotisserie baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
To get Langston for a run at an elusive first American League pennant, the 
Angels had to promise the 29-year-old pitcher a guaranteed five-year payoff, 
making at least one observer gawk at the limousine and armored car that drove 
up to Anaheim Stadium Friday and wonder which carried Langston to his 
introductory press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who agreed to terms with the Angels last Friday, signed Friday after 
his session with reporters. He posed for pictures with team owner Gene Autry 
and General Manager Mike Port, holding his uniform shirt with his name and the 
No. 12 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
The number had belonged to Rader, but he relinquished it so Langston could 
continue a tradition begun in high school -- and fulfill a prophecy Rader had 
issued earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was walking with him in spring training he said, 'You'll probably be here 
next year and I'll have to give up my number,' "Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, he took a peek at the shirt before holding it in front of his 
gray pinstriped suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make sure it didn't say Rader and they were deking me," Langston 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
All the numbers shown by the Angels were right for Langston, who professed no 
regret over signing relatively early in the free-agent chase and perhaps 
passing up an even more lucrative deal. Of the free agents left unsigned, San 
Diego reliever Mark Davis and Milwaukee outfielder Robin Yount are the two who 
could exceed Langston's deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with what I signed," said Langston, 16-14 last season with 
Seattle and Montreal and 86-76 lifetime. "If their contracts are bigger, fine. 
I don't think I could ever say I got a bum deal. The Angels are a first-class 
organization and I'm very excited about playing here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Angels are definitely going to be the front-runner (in the 
American League West). The A's have got to be feeling pressure and they've lost 
some key players. Dave Henderson is my next-door neighbor (in Bellevue, Wash.) 
and he was saying how much they're going to miss Dave Parker. The Angels were a 
great team before I joined, and I hope I can add my two bits to it." 
</P>
<P>
And if they can add Yount . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're trying very hard after Robin Yount," Langston said. "I'm a fan 
of Robin Yount. I enjoy the way he plays the game. He's always been a 
consistent player, a team player. I was hoping maybe Joe Carter would sign, but 
Joe's got to be pretty happy in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were among Langston's emotional preferences when he and his agent, 
Arn Tellem, began talking to various teams. They spoke with four American 
League and five National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (the Padres') situation is, they're kind of in turmoil a little bit 
because Joan Kroc is selling the team," said Langston, a San Diego native. "San 
Diego is one of the teams I wanted to get involved with. They were there, but 
there were teams I wanted to get more involved with. Their concern was to sign 
Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had to make our decision and I'm real happy with it. I didn't want 
to get into a situation where people were bidding back and forth. I just wanted 
to hear offers and make a decision. . . . The Dodgers were very competitive, 
very close. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the no-trade clause was a very important issue. Having been traded, 
when you have to uproot your family, it's not fun to go through. The Angels 
jumped to it when we brought it up. It was something I didn't want to give up 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the Angels means he will have to give up hopes of winning a batting 
title. But a .175 average isn't much to give up in exchange for $16 million, 
the chance to regularly watch Gretzky -- "I'm a huge fan of his. I always 
followed him and since he's been with the Kings I've come down here to catch a 
few games" -- and the opportunity to live out a dream. 
</P>
<P>
That the Angels open next season April 3 in Seattle against his former 
teammates makes it that much sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollars and cents wasn't a big issue," he said. "It was more which 
organization I wanted to be with. I'm looking forward to being in a pennant 
race and being with a team that can win the whole ball of wax. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say there's not going to be pressure. There's going to be 
pressure in this game no matter what. I feel I can adapt to pressure. I had a 
lot of things going on last year and I felt I kept my focus on the game pretty 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm going to play the game the same whether it's a one-year deal or 
five-year deal. I'm a poor loser and I'm looking forward to playing on a winner 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Port said that he didn't detour to see Robin Yount or Mark Davis on his 
way home from the winter baseball meetings in Nashville, Tenn. Refusing to be 
more specific, Port said he expected to know soon the outcome of some 
"inquiries and projects" discussed at the meetings. Asked if anything were 
close, he replied, "I could not tell you no."

EXPOS GOT LANGSTON -- MUCH TO CHAGRIN OF METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time the thought of being the most lusted-after bit of baseball flesh is 
suggested, Mark Langston turns his head away. Reality comes before fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
He left the fantasy, he said, when the New York Mets didn't get him from 
Seattle and the Montreal Expos did. That's reality. He won't become a free 
agent until the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the Dwight Gooden of the Montreal pitching staff, and the Expos are 
giving Langston something to think about other than his own record. The Mets 
have shown their vulnerability, and the Expos are in contention, something 
Langston has never experienced before. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if it's fantasy you like, that belongs to Joe McIlvaine, who was writing 
the fantasy for the Mets. All winter and all spring McIlvaine, the Mets' vice 
president, thought of the pitching he was going to put together. 
</P>
<P>
"It staggered me," McIlvaine mused Tuesday night. Count 'em: Gooden, Langston, 
Darling, Ojeda, Cone. It suggested the Cleveland Indians of Lemon, Wynn, Feller 
and Garcia or the Orioles of Palmer, McNally, Cuellar and Dobson -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
"We were about as close as you can come to making the deal on a number of 
occasions," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners hadn't even tried to sign Langston. He was too good, worth too 
much. They had to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Langston saw himself in the rotation in McIlvaine's mind. "That many top 
pitchers; they would push each other to new levels," he said. "If you're a 
competitor, that kind of thing is great. It doesn't mean jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine had determined that Langston had the best lefty promise in the 
American League. He'd pitched for a bad team and in a tiny ballpark, and he'd 
get only better for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 28, had five seasons with Seattle. He was an eye-opening left-handed 
pitcher. He has a high kick that brings Warren Spahn to mind. He throws a 
fastball consistently in the 90s, has an outstanding slider and knows how to 
pitch a little bit. He had won 70 games and lost 62. Once he even won 19 games. 
Three times he had the most strikeouts in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine made the well-reported offers of Howard Johnson, Sid Fernandez, David 
West -- the bright pitcher of the farm system -- and their top minor-league 
right-hander, Kevin Tapani. And the Mets wanted a 24-hour window to get 
Langston to agree to an extension of his contract. "I think we could have done 
it," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
How could the Mariners not go for it? Well, you have to know a little about the 
Mariners, as Langston does. In his five seasons he never saw a sign that owner 
George Argyros would spend a quarter to win anything. Each time the deal was on 
the brink, it was pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, the Expos got in with an underbid of three unproven 
pitchers. Langston understands that better than most. "Now the Mariners are 
rebuilding," he said. "They've been rebuilding for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine said he last talked to Woody Woodward, the former Yankee general 
manger who runs the Mariners as best he can, at 9 p.m. May 24. If Argyros was 
balking at the potential cost of the quartet from the Mets, McIlvaine 
restructured the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the truth be known," he said, his last offer was two pitchers from the 
major-league roster. Presumably Fernandez and Roger McDowell or Rick Aguilera 
-- he won't say who. Argyros would save some money. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking there wasn't going to be a trade," McIlvaine said. When he woke 
up the next morning, the Expos, who didn't get into the running until the last 
week, had Langston. The price was Gene Harris, Brian Holman and Randy Johnson 
-- not exactly household names in Montreal, Seattle or New York. 
</P>
<P>
And abruptly the Expos had made a giant leap up to the best in the division. 
"If somebody else in our division had got him, I would have been shocked if we 
had won," Dave Dombrowski, the Expos' young general manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Mariners had a scout at each of the Expos' spring-training games, 
and at the end of camp the scout said, "Dave, I wish you guys had shown some 
interest in Langston." 
</P>
<P>
Forty games into the season the Expos' rotation was getting shaky, and 
Dombrowski, convinced he couldn't get the window of negotiation he also wanted, 
offered the young pitchers the Mariners' scout wanted. And all three came with 
minimum salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Now Langston is looking forward to the challenge of the contender in other 
ways. "I look forward to the pressure," he said. "I want it. I want the chance 
to find out how good I can be. I'll benefit from it. Which situation do you 
like, pitching for first place or being 35 games behind?" 
</P>
<P>
Some players are more effective when the game means nothing. "I want to be part 
of something every time out that means something," he said. "When it's over, 
then I'll think about free agency." 
</P>
<P>
The offers will be staggering. The Expos are counting on Langston finding 
Montreal a pleasant place to play. The organization is ambitious, and he likes 
his teammates. And if he keeps the Expos in the race, maybe the excitement will 
hold him. "If we win here, that's the situation everybody plays for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now every city and every stadium is a new experience. Almost every batter is. 
But he's noticed that he likes the "leadership" on the Expos. Spike Owen, the 
feisty shortstop "leads with personality." Tim Raines "leads with performance." 
Langston never felt that with Seattle. The Expos already have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine called that "the incumbency advantage." He sounded jealous.

MARK LANGSTON 
</P>
<P>
Age: 29 
</P>
<P>
Position: Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
Major league experience: Six years 
</P>
<P>
How obtained: Signed as free agent, Dec. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pertinent stats: Went a combined 16-14 in 1989 with Seattle and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Led the American League in strikeouts in 1984, 1986 and 1987. Signed a 
five-year, $16-million contract with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: Considered baseball's premier free agent last fall, Langston's 
presence has given the Angels a surplus of quality starters. The left-hander is 
best known for his fastball, which has helped him strike out at least 200 in 
five of the last six seasons, but he also can be effective with a variety of 
breaking and offspeed pitches. Langston has had a tendency to give up the long 
ball -- he allowed 30 or more home runs a season from 1986-88 -- but many came 
inside Seattle's cozy Kingdome. His earned-run average has improved in each of 
the last four seasons, from 5.47 to 4.85, 3.84, 3.34 and 2.74, and he has 
proven a durable commodity. He has been on the disabled list just once in six 
years.

<P>
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.

I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.

BOB GREENE: SCORE THIS ONE AS A STRIKEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's simply that I no longer understand baseball. I used to; when I was a 
kid, I seemed to know quite a bit about baseball. Maybe I've just gotten stupid 
when it comes to baseball. That's the only logical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
What brought this to mind was a newspaper story reporting that one Mark 
Langston had become the highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
Langston, a left-handed pitcher, had signed a five-year contract with the 
California Angels for $16 million. No other player has ever received a total 
package of $16 million before. 
</P>
<P>
The story was filled with dollar figures, and there was a nice quote from Mark 
Langston's agent, and then finally -- in the next-to-last paragraph -- was the 
one piece of information I had been looking for: 
</P>
<P>
Langston's record last year was 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that might be a typo. A pitcher has a season in which he wins 16 
games and loses 14, and he becomes the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
I did some research. Mark Langston, the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball, has never had a season in which he won 20 games. The season before 
last, Langston had a record of 15-11. Two years before that, he was 12-14. In 
'85, he was 7-14. His career record is 86-76. The highest-paid player in the 
history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
I called a friend whom I consider a true baseball expert. His name is Rob 
Fleder; he is former articles editor for Sports Illustrated, and now is 
executive editor of The National, the soon-to-debut sports daily. Basically 
Fleder told me that, yes, I was stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the records lie," Fleder said. "Mark Langston has played 
most of his career for the Seattle Mariners, a terrible baseball team. You 
can't judge Langston's skills by his won-loss record." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to make sense -- at least a little sense. Certainly if Langston has 
spent most of his career with a bad team, it figures that he might not have won 
as many games as he might have with a good team. Still, though . . . a player 
whose lifetime record is 86-76, a player coming off a 16-14 season, getting the 
biggest contract in history? 
</P>
<P>
"He's really pretty good," Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure he is. Ted Williams was pretty good, too; many say he was the best 
hitter who ever played baseball. In 1941, the year that Williams hit .406, he 
was just coming off a contract that paid him $10,000 a year. That's not so 
important, though -- $10,000 in 1941 meant something different. What is 
important is what happened much later, in 1959. Williams, for the first time in 
his baseball career, was having a bad year. For the first time ever, Williams 
hit below .300. The Boston Red Sox, knowing how valuable he had been to the 
team and the city, offered him a raise for the next year -- a salary of 
$125,000, which would have been his highest salary ever. Williams turned it 
down. He wanted less. He said he had not performed well, and he demanded a pay 
cut. He got it. The Red Sox paid him $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston (16-14), the highest-paid player in the history of baseball, will 
make $3.2 million a year. "The thing you've got to remember," Rob Fleder said, 
"is that Langston's timing was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Fleder was not referring to Langston's timing on the pitcher's mound. He was 
referring to the fact that CBS television has just signed a $1.1-billion, 
four-year deal to broadcast Major League baseball. This TV deal has made 
baseball's owners incredibly wealthy before they sell a single ticket -- so 
wealthy that they can afford to make Mark Langston (16-14, 86-76 lifetime) the 
highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it really all comes down to Kim LeMasters, doesn't it?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it does," Rob Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters is the CBS entertainment executive who resigned recently because 
he had a bad streak of luck in choosing the shows on CBS' prime-time schedule. 
Because of Kim LeMasters' losing streak, CBS has been finishing last in the 
ratings. Because CBS has been finishing last, it needed a symbolic programming 
stroke in an attempt to turn the network around. Because CBS needed the 
symbolic programming stroke, it swallowed hard and paid $1.1 billion for the 
rights to telecast baseball. Because it paid the $1.1 billion, the California 
Angels could afford to hire Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters may be temporarily out of work, but thanks to him Mark Langston 
(16-14, 86-76 lifetime) is the highest-paid player in the history of baseball 
-- a sport about which I am stupid. Was Ted Williams stupid, too?

JIM MURRAY: IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE'S PITCHING FOR THE FOREIGN LEGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposition for Mark Langston, the baseball player, is really quite simple: 
does he want to be a left-handed pitcher or a lanceur gaucher? Does he want to 
be known as a strikeout king or le roi des retraits au baton? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he cope with an environment where an earned-run average is a moyenne des 
points merite with an accent over the "e"? Where his fastball is known as the 
rapide and his slider as a glissante? And his curve is spelt courbe? The 
changeup is a changement de vitesse? A walk is a but sur balles? 
</P>
<P>
Does Kevin Mitchell look any easier to pitch to because he's a frappeur instead 
of a power hitter? Is a home run any easier to give up because it's a coup 
circuit? Is it any more comforting to give up a base hit when it's described as 
a coup sur? 
</P>
<P>
Like to see your shutout referred to as a blanchissage. Would you? 
</P>
<P>
French is a beautiful language. I mean, it's got words such as Beaujolais and 
mon petit chou. It's the language of love. 
</P>
<P>
But is it the language of baseball? Does the game lose something in 
translation? Ballplayers who play the game in Montreal tend to feel they're on 
a demonstration tour of southern France. "You never feel as if you have a home 
game," Ron Fairly, who played there for five years and rolled up several 
hundred coups sur, once observed. "The weather was very changeable. It ranged 
from bad to terrible. The announcer used to come on in the morning to predict 
the day would be 'cold and windy with intermittent daylight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston is the curious case of a guy who belongs on Broadway but finds 
himself playing Bridgeport. Or Peoria. Or, as in his case, a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the best pitchers in the grand old game but found himself on the 
mound for the Seattle Mariners. That's like Caruso winding up in a barber shop 
quartet, Laurence Olivier in "Smokey and the Bandit II." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners are less a team than a sitcom. Pitching in the Kingdome is not a 
job, it's a sentence. Four times in its brief history, it has been the home run 
capital of the world. Most of those were hit by the visitors. The "power" 
alleys are a laughable 357 1/2 feet, the foul poles are 316 feet away. Umpires 
have to be careful invoking the infield-fly rule. It might turn out to be a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Finding yourself in the Kingdome with Jose Canseco is like finding yourself in 
an elevator with a lion. Nevertheless, Mark Langston won 19 games in this 
closet in 1987, a year when 218 home runs rattled out in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Langston learned early on the importance of geography. Pitching in that 
glorified tent, Langston won 17 games, led the league in strikeouts, even had 
two shutouts, in 1984, his rookie season. Nobody even looked up. Meanwhile, 
over in New York, another rookie pitcher, Dwight Gooden won the same number of 
games, did not lead the league in strikeouts and only had one more shutout. 
But, he became rookie of the year, Doctor K, and, the next year, Cy Young 
winner. Langston became What'd-you-say-his-name-was-again? 
</P>
<P>
Old What's his name has more lifetime strikeouts than Dr. K. He has led the 
league three times in strikeouts. He struck out 16 in a game (against Toronto) 
last year. He just missed a no-hitter, throwing a one-hit game against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he had to hire a Hollywood publicity firm to get his name in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
He played in the Kingdome on a team that finished last two of the five seasons 
he pitched there and next-to-last in two others. He knew he had to get out of 
there. So, he forced a trade. And he got to go to -- ta, da! -- Montreal! 
</P>
<P>
Now, Montreal is not exactly the show-biz capital of the world. It's a nice 
place to visit, but I wouldn't want to pitch there. At least in Seattle, they 
knew he was a hurler and not a lanceur. And Mark has no great desire to become 
Doctor Retraits Au Baton. He probably knew he was in trouble the minute he 
stepped off the plane and someone addressed him as mon vieux (old friend). The 
trouble with Montreal is their heroes come with hockey sticks attached. 
Everyone else is Coco Laboy. 
</P>
<P>
So, when does Mark What's-His-Name get to play the Palace, trod the boards at 
the Old Vic, so to speak, get on prime time? He needs a compass, not a curve. 
Fame and fortune lies south and Langston seems to be looking for the Northwest 
Passage. One more move and he'll need a dog sled. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal would like to keep him. He's the best lanceur they've got. But the 
Expos would have liked to have kept Andre Dawson, Gary Carter, Rusty Staub and 
Warren Cromartie. They all went over the wall. Tim Raines tried. Andre Dawson 
even signed a blank contract at Chicago rather than go back over the border. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal took a calculated risk in trading for Langston. He becomes a free 
agent at the end of the year. Montreal is hoping he will find their city rich 
in Old World charm. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's gerant (manager), Bob Rodgers, is acutely aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. Everybody wants to play in Southern California or New York," he 
admits. "What we have to do is convince them we have a first-class operation 
here, that it doesn't snow in Montreal in July, and that it just might be one 
of the best places in baseball to win a pennant." 
</P>
<P>
Gerant Rodgers acknowledges lanceur Langston, who has won 10 games for the 
Montreal Expos since his escape from Seattle, will be avidly sought when he 
reaches free agency this fall. "He has great stuff, but he's a pitcher not a 
thrower. He could mean a pennant to a number of teams. I would hope one of them 
would be us." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is unsure. He admits he is pitching this year with his bags packed and 
the car running and double-parked. "But, what I wanted basically was to get 
into a pennant race. I had never been in one and I like having the games mean 
something." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the French word is for pennant. Up to now, of course, they 
haven't needed one up there. If they don't get one this year, the word for 
Langston next year may be au revoir.

ANGELS PUMPED UP ABOUT NEW TEAMMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mark Langston's signing with the Angels wasn't the best news Sandy Alderson 
heard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, congratulate the Angels," said Alderson, general manager of the World 
Series champion Oakland Athletics. He paused, obviously thinking about his own 
club's concerns. "I think," he added somberly. 
</P>
<P>
Angel players and coaches exulted over the signing of Langston, interpreting 
the addition of the 29-year-old left-hander as a sign of the club's commitment 
to the future and proclaiming that his $16-million, five-year contract won't 
spark envy among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting a World Series ring on our fingers at the end of '90, that's the only 
thing we're thinking about," right-hander Bert Blyleven said. "I don't think 
the players are jealous. Other people see the big money, but we don't talk 
about that among ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased we got Mark Langston. He's been very consistent and I know he 
wants to play on a winning ballclub. This shows that (General Manager) Mike 
Port really wants to put a winning team on the field. I think everybody in the 
organization has to feel pleased." 
</P>
<P>
And apparently they do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Wally Joyner said. "I think this will help us close the gap 
between us and the A's. One of the reasons we went after Mark Langston was to 
better the ballclub. This is not going to do anything but improve our club and 
our staff. Hopefully, down the line there's a couple of players left that they 
might sign." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, was skeptical about the news 
until he was repeatedly reassured that Langston's signing was certain. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case, it's great," said Lachemann, whose staff's earned-run 
average of 3.28 was second-best in the American League last season. "Obviously, 
we've improved the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's been a great pitcher in our league before he went over to the National 
League. It's an indication that (owner Gene) Autry and Mike Port are really 
concentrating on trying to win. They realize we had a very fine year but came 
up eight games short. This is an indication they want not just a winning 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say winning, you talk about being over .500, but really winning is 
what Oakland did this year, winning the pennant and the Series." 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann said he knew Langston casually from the pitcher's time in Seattle and 
is already looking forward to working with him in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relatively eager for spring training three days after the season ended," 
Lachemann said. "This makes everything that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven is also anticipating Langston's arrival because he expects to reap a 
financial benefit of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Now maybe Chuck Finley will leave me alone and won't bother me to buy him 
lunch all the time," Blyleven said. "Mark Langston makes more money, and Chuck 
will probably hook onto him now."

ANGELS RALLY TO CATCH A'S BUT LOSE IN 12, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Angels knew for whom the rally bells tolled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the souvenir bells the 34,370 fans at Anaheim Stadium received upon arrival 
didn't ring true as the Oakland Athletics scored twice in the 12th inning for 
7-5 victory over the Angels Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three games that the Angels went to 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Weiss opened the 12th with a single off Mark Eichhorn (0-1), who had 
pitched three scoreless innings. Stan Javier forced Weiss at second. 
</P>
<P>
Javier went to third when Rickey Henderson's hard grounder kicked off the glove 
of shortstop Kent Anderson into left field for a single. Javier scored when 
Carney Lansford's grounder bounced off Johnny Ray's chest. Henderson went to 
second and then scored on Jose Canseco's single to center. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had rallied from a three-run deficit in the sixth inning on Dante 
Bichette's third home run of the season to pull even with the A's at 5-5. It 
was Bichette's home run that gave the Angels a 7-5 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins in 12 innings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mark Langston, who pitched seven hitless innings against Seattle 
last Wednesday in his previous start, did not approach that form Tuesday night. 
He gave up seven hits, including home runs to Lansford and Mark McGwire in the 
third inning, and left after six innings. The Angels rallied in the bottom of 
that inning to tie the score, ensuring that Langston would not be the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with four earned runs and made a throwing error on a 
pickoff play to set up the fifth Oakland run. He struck out six and walked two 
while making 105 pitches, a hefty total for so short a stint. He made 98 over 
seven innings last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by the Angels would have given them a 6-2 record and equaled their 
best starts. They had 6-2 records after eight games in 1970 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
A's starter Mike Moore, once a teammate of Langston's in Seattle, gave up three 
runs Tuesday. Reliever Todd Burns gave up the three-run home run to Bichette. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what Langston would do for an encore was answered quickly. As 
he did during his seven no-hit innings, he walked the leadoff hitter, Rickey 
Henderson. But the pattern was broken when the second hitter, Lansford, rapped 
a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Langston got out of the inning with the help of an excellent pickoff throw to 
second that caught Henderson leaning, but he couldn't escape the third inning 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The A's did their damage with two outs. Lansford powered a 1-0 pitch a few rows 
into the left-field seats, and Canseco followed with a shot up the middle that 
blew past Langston's upreached glove and into center field. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire then reached down for Langston's first pitch and slammed a home run 
deep to left field. 
</P>
<P>
It was his third home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner 
walked and scored when Chili Davis blasted a 2-0 pitch 420 feet to center field 
that pulled the Angels to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Langston seemed to settle into a groove in the middle innings. He struck out 
the last two batters of the fourth and first man in the fifth for a total of 
six strikeouts before Henderson bounced a ground-rule double down the 
left-field line. Canseco followed with a double off the wall in left, scoring 
Henderson for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The A's padded that to 5-2 in the sixth, without benefit of a hit. Dave 
Henderson drew a leadoff walk and went to third when Langston threw away an 
intended pickoff throw to first. Henderson held at third on Terry Steinbach's 
grounder to third, but with the squeeze play on, Lance Blankenship laid down a 
perfect bunt up the first-base line that allowed Henderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels then tied the score with one swing of Bichette's bat. Ray beat out a 
grounder to third for an infield hit and Joyner barely missed a home run, 
sending center fielder Dave Henderson crashing into the wall to make the catch. 
That was all for Moore, who was relieved by right-hander Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Burns threw four straight balls to Davis, who had switched to the left side of 
the plate. That brought up Bichette, a right-handed hitter, who slammed a 3-1 
pitch over the center-field fence. The drive was measured at 422 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa said his club wasn't taking this series against the 
Angels lightly. "You can't waste a golden opportunity to take your best shot," 
he said. "It's kind of unusual because we play them two and then don't see them 
for three months (July 23-26 at Oakland). We can't waste these games." 
</P>
<P>
His team didn't waste any games in the first week of the season, winning five 
of six. "The truth is, we had a solid first week," he said. "The starting 
pitching, relief pitching, hitting. The only problem is that it was last week, 
not this week." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa also said his team is aware of the defensive exploits of Angel 
outfielder Dante Bichette, who had five assists last week, but isn't about to 
change its strategy. "We know he throws well. We knew that last season," he 
said. "Still, our style is to push. If there's a guy on second base and there's 
a single to left field, unless the ball is in the guy's hand, we're going to 
send him. You don't take foolish chances, though." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson's first-inning walk was the 1,000th of his career, fifth among 
active players. Dwight Evans, Willie Randolph, Keith Hernandez and Brian 
Downing are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill 
Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
NEW MARINERS MAKE PITCH TO MAKE UP FOR LOSS OF LANGSTON, 6-3

<P>
When the Seattle Mariners turned down some big names to get three young 
pitchers for Mark Langston last month, it raised plenty of eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, it turns out, may have known exactly what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman earned his first American League victory and Gene Harris got his 
first major-league save Sunday at Cleveland as the Mariners beat the Indians, 
6-3. Holman and Harris both came in the trade with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Johnson, the third player obtained from the Expos, pitched three-hit ball 
for 7 2/3 innings in Saturday's 3-1 victory over the Indians, improving his 
record with Seattle to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I see a lot," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "That's three top quality 
arms and three competitors out there. I'm tickled to death for us." 
</P>
<P>
Holman (1-1) allowed seven hits, including a homer, double and single by Pete 
O'Brien, in Brian Holman 
</P>
<P>
5 2/3 innings. Harris worked the final 3 1/3 innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not Mark Langston," Holman said. "We're Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and 
Brian Holman. People are never going to be satisfied if they're looking for us 
to be Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I was trying too hard to impress people (at first) because it 
was a big trade." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Bill McGuire hit his first major-league homer, a three-run shot off 
Bud Black, in a four-run sixth inning that made it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Black (5-7) yielded five runs, two of them earned, on seven hits in 5 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Texas 1 -- Dave Parker and Mark McGwire hit back-to-back homers in 
the sixth inning as the A's increased their AL West lead to three games over 
the Angels by downing the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (8-4) allowed Texas three hits in 6 1/3 innings, lowering his 
earned-run average to 1.91. Greg Cadaret got one out and Gene Nelson retired 
all seven batters he faced for his first save and Oakland's 23rd, tops in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
The A's had a 2-1 lead when Parker led off the sixth with his ninth home run 
and McGwire followed with his 12th, both off Kevin Brown (5-3). McGwire also 
had a sacrifice fly in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Bush hit a two-run homer and Kirby Puckett 
added a two-run single, leading the Twins past the White Sox at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (7-4) allowed eight hits in seven-plus innings and got solid 
relief from Juan Berenguer and Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
Berenguer entered with a 4-1 lead, the bases loaded and none out in the eighth. 
He retired Ivan Calderon on a foul pop and struck out Carlos Martinez before 
walking Dan Pasqua to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon came on to get the side out and pitched a scoreless ninth to register 
his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Melido Perez (3-8) lost for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Detroit 0 -- Mike Flanagan and Duane Ward combined on a four-hitter 
at Toronto and the Blue Jays handed the Tigers their fourth shutout of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan (4-5) allowed three hits in seven innings. It was his first outing 
since a sore left shoulder forced him to miss two starts. Ward finished for his 
fifth save, striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto rookie Junior Felix went four for five with a two-run homer. Rookie 
Mike Schwabe (1-1) shut out Toronto until the fifth, when Rance Mulliniks 
doubled and Felix hit an 0-and-2 pitch into the second deck for his fifth home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Baltimore 1 -- Rob Deer doubled home the go-ahead run in the ninth 
inning at Baltimore and the Brewers handed the Orioles their fourth loss in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, leading the AL East, won eight straight before their recent slump. 
Milwaukee has won eight of 12. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Surhoff got a bunt single with one out in the ninth against Kevin Hickey 
(1-1), who gave way to Gregg Olson. Surhoff stole second and third before 
coming home on Deer's double. Deer took third on Mike Felder's single and 
scored on Olson's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Crim (5-3) pitched one inning to get the victory. Dan Plesac worked the 
ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4-8, Boston 2-7 -- Rickey Henderson snapped an eighth-inning tie with 
a run-scoring pinch single to win the nightcap and Don Mattingly drove in six 
runs as the Yankees swept the Red Sox at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly hit a pair of two-run homers in the second game and had a two-run 
double to back the pitching of Andy Hawkins (6-7) in the opener. Hawkins 
allowed four hits and two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly was five for eight for the day and has 40 runs batted in this season. 
His second home run gave New York a 7-2 lead in the seventh inning of the 
second game, but the Red Sox rallied for five runs off Lance McCullers to tie 
the score. Scott Nielsen (1-0) halted the Boston rally and got the win.

OAKLAND SCORES TWICE IN 12TH TO BEAT ANGELS

Oakland A's at 5-5.

slamming a home run deep to left field. It was his third home run of the

</P>
<P>
Langston did recover his poise, striking out two in the fourth inning for a 
total of five. He had struck out three Mariners in his seven hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner

</P>
<P>
Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill 
Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip. Trainer Ned Bergert said Schroeder 
(sore right elbow) is throwing again and is feeling better. However, Schroeder

<P>
ANGELS: FANS' PATIENCE RUNS THIN AFTER HE GIVES UP SIX RUNS IN 2 2/3 INNINGS IN 
8-1 LOSS TO INDIANS. WINLESS STREAK REACHES SEVEN WEEKS.

<P>
Mark Langston lost again Sunday, and this time he lost sympathy as well as the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Close scores have dogged Langston during his search for a fifth victory, now in 
its seventh week. In his last two starts before Sunday, he lost despite 
pitching complete games, yielding two runs in one, three in the other. Each 
time, he got only one run from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't let them thwart him again. 
</P>
<P>
This time he did himself in, lasting only 2 2/3 innings in the Angels' 8-1 loss 
to Cleveland. He was charged with six runs, the final two scoring on Joel 
Skinner's three-run homer off relief pitcher Willie Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed in (Langston) and supported him, and I will continue to 
believe in and support him," Manager Doug Rader said. "I don't think there's 
any question he will turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Langston has lost seven consecutive decisions, falling to 4-12. He has not won 
since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians scored twice in the first inning on Candy Maldonado's single to 
center field. After a single to Chris James put runners at first and third, 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann made his first visit to the mound, only five 
batters into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"(Langston) just had a rough outing," catcher Lance Parrish said. "Everybody 
has them. It came at an unfortunate time for him because I know he's trying to 
turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann came back in the second inning, during which Langston gave up another 
run on Jerry Browne's single. 
</P>
<P>
By Lachemann's third trip, Langston had given up four runs and 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Langston left the mound amid booing from some in the crowd of 32,129 in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was his shortest outing since June 15, 1988, when he was with Seattle and 
lasted only two innings against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody was too hard on him," Parrish said. "I think he has pitched 
well for us for a while. We just hadn't been able to get the win. All of a 
sudden, he has a bad game, and people react like he's been this way all along." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, whose earned-run average rose from 3.57 to 3.89, already had left the 
stadium before postgame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he's frustrated at this point. It's very understandable," Parrish 
said. "Mark Langston has been for some time one of the best pitchers in the 
American League. This is probably very hard for him, especially since he's on a 
new ballclub and trying to make a good impression." 
</P>
<P>
Langston was acquired in the off-season, signing a $16-million contract for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, Lachemann and Parrish agreed that Langston struggled with his location 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't throwing bad, velocity-wise," Parrish said. "His location was a 
little off. He wasn't able to get his breaking stuff over to make the fastball 
effective. Just a bad day for him." 
</P>
<P>
One irony of Langston's outing was that pitching poorly might not have made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had scored only 15 runs in his 11 previous losses, only nine by his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
They scored only one Sunday, fulfilling what has come to seem the Angels' quota 
with Langston on the mound. In seven of his past nine starts, the Angels have 
scored no more than one run, losing four times by 2-1 scores and once by 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"The game might have been a little different if he held them to two," Parrish 
said. "We might have been able to put something together, you never know. It 
was just unfortunate how it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Langston has not won a game in his past seven decisions over nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent Sunday, Greg Swindell, allowed a run in the first inning when Luis 
Polonia scored on Dave Winfield's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell retired 14 batters in a row, beginning with Lee Stevens on a 
double-play grounder in the first inning and ending with Polonia's single with 
one out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell (6-5) left after allowing six hits in eight innings, giving way to 
relief ace Doug Jones, who had not pitched in four days and needed the work. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Angels to 12 1/2 games behind Oakland in the American 
League West as they head into a four-game series at Oakland beginning tonight. 
It is series that once was expected to bear heavily on the pennant race, but 
now is important mostly to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this whole road trip and the next home stand is vitally important," 
Rader said. "I think it's our whole season." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels will play 10 road games against divisional rivals Oakland, Seattle 
and Minnesota before returning home to face Oakland, Boston, Baltimore and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"If things don't go well during this next road trip and home stand, it's going 
to be very disappointing for us," Rader said. "It's vitally important for us to 
get something going right now." 
</P>
<P>
And the same for Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to keep grinding," Lachemann said. "Not just him -- us as a 
ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield was pinch-hit for in the eighth inning, leaving the 
game with a strained right shoulder. His status was reported as day to day. 
Schofield said arm soreness had been bothering him for a few days and described 
it as normal during the course of any season. He will continue taking oral 
anti-inflammatory medication, he said. . . . Update in the great lineup debate: 
Sunday's lineup was identical to the one used Friday, when the Angels defeated 
Cleveland, 9-4, in the opening game of this series. It marked only the second 
time this season Manager Doug Rader has duplicated a lineup. Rader has used 
different lineups in response to the team's numerous injuries and in an attempt 
to handle various other situations, particularly involving the once-overcrowded 
outfield. The other times Rader used identical lineups were April 11 and 14. 
That lineup is one that will not be repeated; it included Claudell Washington, 
since traded to the Yankees.

OUTSIDE HELP COST PADRES, AGENT SAYS 
</P>

<P>
If Padre owner Joan Kroc had permitted the front office to handle the Mark 
Langston negotiations instead of retaining an outside attorney, Langston likely 
would have signed with the Padres instead of the Angels, agent Arn Tellem said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, with everything being equal, Mark's preference was to play for 
the San Diego Padres all along," said Tellem, Langston's agent. "If it had been 
left to the baseball people, he would have been a Padre already. But it's quite 
obvious the baseball people there are not in charge, and it's hurting that 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based attorney Fred Lane has been retained by the Padres to handle 
negotiations with Langston and reliever Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind, none whatsoever," Tellem said, "that if Dick 
Freeman (president), Tony Siegle (vice president, personnel) and Jack McKeon 
(manager) were involved, we'd already have had a press conference with Mark in 
a San Diego uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"But when the non-baseball people got involved, it put another tone on the 
negotiations. That's when it became apparent that nothing was going to get done 
with the Padres. And that's what really disappointed Mark, because that's where 
he wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, the left-handed starter who was considered the prize of the 
free-agent sweepstakes, instead signed a five-year, $16-million contract Friday 
with the Angels. It is unknown whether the Padres would have paid that kind of 
money for a free agent, but Tellem suggested that Langston might have signed 
for considerably less if the front-office had handled the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Padre front office refused comment, and Kroc was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced Mark would have signed with San Diego," Tellem said. "Mark just 
loves the area. He had a slight preference for staying in the National League 
because he liked to hit. He's got great friends there. He just thinks the world 
of (Padre players) Tony Gwynn and Bruce Hurst. . . . It would have just been 
all so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Lane has worked extensively with Kroc involving the McDonald's organization. 
Tellem said that although Lane probably is a fine lawyer, and certainly seemed 
quite competent, the fact that he has no baseball background sent a flare to 
Langston that the Padres were not going to be serious negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame, a real shame to see what's happening to that organization. No 
one's in charge, and the organization is suffering because of it. There's no 
doubt in my mind that's happening. 
</P>
<P>
"If the front-office was involved, I think they would have had both Marks 
signed by now. As it is, they have a good chance of not having any." 
</P>
<P>
The other "Mark," of course, is Davis, who won the Cy Young Award for the 
Padres last season with 44 saves. Davis, who was hoping to sign with the Padres 
just days after the end of the season, filed for free agency when negotiations 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, according to sources, are prepared to offer Davis a four-year 
guaranteed contract for $8.8 million. It would be the first time since 
negotiations began that the Padres have offered a four-year contract and the 
first four-year contract offered to a reliever since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also offered Davis salary arbitration, a procedural step most clubs 
take with their unsigned free agents to protect negotiating rights until Jan. 
8, when they would expire until May. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his agent, Alan Hendricks, are not expected to accept or reject the 
Padre offer until sifting all offers at the major league baseball winter 
meetings beginning Monday in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royals already have made a lucrative offer in an attempt to 
acquire Davis, and the Angels and New York Yankees also have engaged in 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Davis proved that he's the best reliever in the game right now," Royals 
General Manager John Schuerholz said, "and we'd like to have him. We need to 
close the gap between us and Oakland, and having a guy like Mark Davis would 
help enable us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Padres talked on the telephone with free-agent center 
fielder Robin Yount, 34, who was selected the Most Valuable Player of the 
American League this past season for the Brewers. Yount later met in person 
with Mike Port, general manager of the Angels. Others interested in Yount 
include the Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves and 
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
And in an attempt to protect themselves in case they lose Davis to free agency, 
the Padres have offered free-agent left-handed reliever Craig Lefferts a 
two-year contract with an option year, according to sources. Lefferts, 32, who 
was traded by the Padres in a seven-player deal that was used to acquire Davis, 
saved 20 games for the San Francisco Giants this past season in a part-time 
role as the stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Davis is our top priority," Siegle said, "but we can't sit back and wait 
for that. We've got to react before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Compte, the agent for Lefferts, said: "Right now we know we're kind of in 
the shadow of Mark Davis, and rightly so. They had little or no interest in 
Craig at the beginning, but now, their interest really has increased." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also will resume trade talks today, when Siegle and McKeon fly to 
Nashville for the winter meetings. They have a meeting scheduled Sunday with 
General Manager Hank Peters of the Cleveland Indians in which they hope to make 
a proposal for center fielder Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians are interested in obtaining one of the Padres' catchers, Benito 
Santiago or Sandy Alomar, Peters said, but have yet to come up with any other 
names in a possible trade package. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do anything until we talk to everybody Sunday," Peters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also has meetings scheduled with the Angels, Kansas City, the Boston Red 
Sox, the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount of interest in Joe because he's going to be an 
important player wherever he goes," Peters said. "I'm not going to say that 
team will win the pennant, but whatever club gets him will have a tremendous 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as Arn Tellem will tell you, the same held true for Langston.

PROGRAM NOTES: Sledgehammer Theatre's next show in the Progressive Stage 
Company space will be Georg Buchner's "Leonce und Lena" Nov. 17. Scott 
Feldsher. Sledgehammer's artistic director, will direct. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tony-award winning director Lloyd Richards will be coming to San Diego a few 
months before he is due to direct August Wilson's "Two Trains Running" at the 
Old Globe Theatre. Richards is the keynote speaker at UC San Diego's conference 
on Cultural Diversity in the American Theatre Nov. 8-11. Writer, director and 
Teatro Campesino artistic director Luis Valdez will appear as the Helen Edison 
Lecturer for UCSD Extension. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Community Theatre will bring Langston Hughes' "Black Nativity" 
back for its third year in a row. It will play at the Educational Cultural 
Complex Nov. 28-Dec. 16 under the direction of UC San Diego professor Floyd 
Gaffney. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Langston Hughes is just one of the many Harlem Renaissance 
characters in "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," the San Diego Rep world 
premiere that will have its first workshop reading this weekend at Newark 
Symphony Hall in Newark, N.J. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Scott, one of the co-producers and co-creators of San Diego's "Suds" went

RADER STILL SMILING EVEN WITHOUT YOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether out of superstition or experience, Doug Rader hasn't permitted himself 
the luxury of daydreaming about adding American League most valuable player 
Robin Yount to a team that already includes Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm not that imaginative to let my imagination run wild," the Angel 
manager said. "I've certainly had some wonderful thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' thoughts have changed as the winter baseball meetings have 
progressed. When Yount postponed his decision on departing Milwaukee, it 
prevented the Angels from addressing their other needs. But Rader said Tuesday 
he doesn't believe the club will suffer because it didn't get Joe Carter from 
Cleveland because Carter might not have been the ideal solution to the Angels' 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our priorities were set in a way that some things hinged upon others taking 
place," Rader said. "It was a case of 'If A and B were accomplished, C is 
feasible.' In terms of opportunity slipping away, that's not the case. A and B 
leading to C is still debatable as far as being the right way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"In acquiring Joe Carter, that would create a void elsewhere, without being 
specific. You can't do that without knowing the availability of somebody 
elsewhere. We didn't feel we were in a position to weaken ourselves elsewhere 
and not have Robin Yount to fill those holes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are said to have offered center fielder Devon White and second 
baseman Johnny Ray to Cleveland for Carter. Instead, Carter's rights were 
traded to the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he has "a lot of things up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
"We're juggling six baseballs and when they come down, hopefully we'll catch 
one or two or three of them on the way down and we'll be better for it," Port 
said. "I'd like to think we will not drop all eight." Langston's signing leaves 
Rader juggling six starting pitchers next season, unless one is traded in the 
interim. It's a happy problem for Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to have Mr. Langston. Not only is he a force unto himself, 
whenever something like that takes place with your pitching staff, it deepens 
it. That's when you become very good," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Oakland: They have seven or eight guys who could start and that 
doesn't even count (Dennis) Eckersley. When you have that much flexibility, 
that's great. . . . The thing about a little extra depth is that when you go 
into a series, you like to see how many runs you can expect to score. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Kansas City, with (Bret) Saberhagen and (Charlie) Leibrandt, that kind 
of depth. Hopefully, it's going to be very difficult to score runs (against the 
Angels). That's good." 
</P>
<P>
But they might have difficulty in scoring runs themselves. That prospect, 
though, is not enough to convince Rader to sacrifice pitching and defense for 
the sake of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The business at hand is to make sure the pitching at hand has the proper 
support," Rader said. "If you borrow from Peter to pay Paul, that doesn't help. 
We've got to make sure we not only can pitch it, we can catch it. If we improve 
our offense, so be it. It's important to improve your strengths." 
</P>
<P>
As strong as Langston has made the Angels' pitching staff, Rader didn't 
celebrate when he heard about the $16-million man's signing. His restraint may 
be an effort to avoid increasing the pressure sure to rest on Langston, the 
team and himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful the organization is able to do something like this, but the 
fact that we have him doesn't guarantee success," Rader said. "If we do 
something special with Mark Langston on the ballclub, that would be the 
appropriate time to jump up and down. Now is not the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd better prepare ourselves for a very difficult pennant race. It's going to 
take a very good ballclub to win it and there's not going to be any easy stops. 
Everybody in our division understands it's going to take 100 wins to win it."

<LEADPARA>  You could almost hear the plop, plop and fizz, fizz Saturday night, the sound
of American League West general managers reaching for relief after they heard
what Ron Darling did.;    Those G.M.s could discount the trade that sent
Darling to the A's because his numbers with the New York Mets and Montreal
Expos said he was a high-risk acquisition. They could discount his debut --
seven innings of two-hit, shutout work against Seattle on Monday -- as a
one-time fluke. But how can the G.M.s write off Darling's second superb outing?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DEAL FOR DARLING CONTINUES TO PAY DIVIDENDS
FOR A'S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     He limited the California Angels to three hits over seven innings in the
A's 3-1 win, and afterward he took a measure of satisfaction in proving his
critics wrong.;    "The last year and a half, for whatever reason, there's
been a lot of negative stuff said about me, and I haven't answered it. I still
won't," Darling said. "Those people have got their opinions. I still think I
can pitch.;    "I think the biggest thing for me is one, to be given the
opportunity to pitch for a good ballclub and two, knowing that they really
want me out there. That's a nice feeling as opposed to what it's been like
over on that other coast.";    The A's can't say enough about what Darling,
5-8 with a 4.37 ERA in 20 starts in the National League this season, has done
on this coast. He had been shipped to Montreal on July 15 because the Expos
wanted to unload Tim Burke's salary. The Expos gave Darling away for two
obscure minor league pitchers a half hour before the July 31 trading
deadline.;    The A's were willing to assume $600,000 in salary and
considerable risk. And Darling's making a difference in the West race. The A's
won their fifth straight and cut the gap between themselves and the
front-running Minnesota Twins to three games. The Chicago White Sox stand
between the A's and Twins, a game out of first.;    Mark Langston (14-6)
hasn't beaten the A's in nine consecutive starts. He lost a no-hitter in the
sixth on Dave Henderson's 24th homer.;    Darling wasn't fazed. His composure
must have been comforting for a team that has watched its starters pitch
erratically all season. He left the bases loaded in the second, then made
perhaps the play of the game in the third when he picked off Luis Polonia at
second.;    "How much of the season do we have left? How many starts does he
have left?" A's Manager Tony La Russa asked. "Just keep doing that, getting
into the seventh or eighth inning and giving up nothing. Whew.";    The play
of the game unfolded so quickly that La Russa marveled. Polonia opened the
bottom of the third with a double off left fielder Willie Wilson's glove, and
Darling walked Wally Joyner. With one out, Darling threw to second, and
shortstop Mike Bordick applied the tag.;    "I had no idea. I'd never seen
him. But that was a hellacious pickoff move," La Russa said.;    Darling sent
accolades Bordick's way, saying Bordick's play and catcher Terry Steinbach's
pitch-calling were the keys.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 6th -- Gallego walked.
Bordick sacrificed, moving Gallego to second. Wilson grounded out, moving
Gallego to third. D.Henderson homered. A's 2, Angels 0.;    A's 8th -- Gallego
homered. A's 3, Angels 0.;    Angels 8th -- Klink pitching. With one out,
Joyner doubled. Winfield walked, and on Klink's wild pitch, Joyner went to
third. On Klink's wild pitch, Joyner scored. A's 3, Angels 1.; OAKLAND

TOP MONEY-MAKERS BOTTOM OUT IN 1ST HALF; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: EIGHT OF THE MAJOR LEAGUES' 10-BIGGEST CONTRACTS BELONG TO PLAYERS 
WHO DIDN'T MAKE 1990 ALL-STAR TEAM. 
</P>

<P>
The big money takes a break at All-Star time. At least this year. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of baseball's 10 biggest contracts belong to players who didn't make the 
1990 All-Star team, including Don Mattingly and three pitchers who threw 
no-hitters this season -- Dave Stewart, Nolan Ryan and Mark Langston (with an 
assist from Mike Witt). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only two Big Ten players who made it to Chicago for tonight's game 
were Oakland's Jose Canseco, baseball's biggest earner at $4.7 million a year, 
and San Francisco's Will Clark, who pulls down a more modest $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a question of whether I'm an All-Star or not?" asked Stewart, who has 
won 20 games in each of the last three seasons for Oakland. "I'm not on the 
team, but that doesn't mean that I'm not deserving. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is, in fact, deserving enough to have negotiated a two-year contract 
last year that will begin paying him $3.5 million a year in 1991. At 11-7, he 
probably was deserving enough to be on the All-Star team this year too. 
</P>
<P>
But Stewart's own Tony La Russa, AL manager by virtue of the A's World Series 
victory last year, said he discussed the situation with Stewart, and the 
decision was mutual. La Russa already had two Oakland pitchers on the staff -- 
Dennis Eckersley and Bob Welch -- and Stewart wanted to make his regular start 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who will make $3.3 million next year, goes into the All-Star break at 8-4 
with a 3.79 ERA and 116 strikeouts after leading the majors with 301 strikeouts 
last year. La Russa, however, assumed Ryan would like the break to rest an 
ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, whose five-year contract averages $3.2 million, has a lower ERA than 
Ryan, 3.71, but a 4-9 record. His pain has been a little lower this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if I'm going out there and getting beat up," Langston said. At one 
point this spring, he lost four consecutive decisions, giving up two runs in 
each. Shouldn't that be good enough to win? "In some instances it is," Langston 
said. "For me, it hasn't been." 
</P>
<P>
The other Big Ten pitcher, Kansas City's Mark Davis, can barely make a case for 
staying in the major leagues after winning the Cy Young last year with 44 saves 
and a 1.85 ERA for San Diego. With a $3.25 million contract at Kansas City this 
year, he has five saves and a 5.66 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals are so desperately seeking solutions that they gave Davis his first 
start in three years Sunday, to no avail. He gave up four runs in 3 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly and Robin Yount are having years so ugly they would make Quasimodo 
shudder. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's problem, too, has been in his back. Earning $3.86 million a year 
from the Yankees, he's batting .253 with five homers and 33 RBIs -- his worst 
start ever. He hasn't homered since May 20. Last year, Mattingly earned the big 
contract with a .303 average, 23 homers and 113 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, who makes $3.2 million a year, had one of the worst slumps of his career 
this year and, after hitting .318 with 21 homers and 103 RBIs in 1989, just 
can't get over the hump in '90. He's hitting .239 with seven homers and 36 RBIs 
at the halfway point this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I may end up with a few more toys," Yount said when he became baseball's first 
$3 million man. "But other than that, I don't think it will have any effect." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Eric Davis and San Diego's Joe Carter have the ninth- and 
10th-biggest contracts at $3.1 million and $3,066,667 per year, and neither is 
on the All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is hitting .233 with 11 homers and 35 RBIs, although he missed nearly a 
month with a sprained right knee. But Davis also missed time because of 
injuries last year and wound up with 101 RBIs and 34 homers in 462 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Carter had 105 RBIs and 35 homers with a .243 average for Cleveland last year 
before being traded to San Diego in the deal that sent Sandy Alomar Jr. to the 
Indians. This season, he has 13 homers and 59 RBIs but is hitting .220. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the guys whose teams are struggling -- such as Carter, Mark Davis, 
Yount and Mattingly -- the No-Star break is a welcome change of pace. Three 
blissful days without baseball, without the pressure of questions such as: What 
did you do to earn your pay today? 
</P>
<P>
"We need not to think about all that stuff during the break," Mattingly said. 
"We need to get away from this for a few days. We need to make a fresh start."

<LEADPARA>  The laws of nature took Tuesday night off -- a good thing for the A's Ron
Darling and Dave Henderson, but not so good for California's Mark Langston.;  
Darling again showed the American League what a washed-up National Leaguer can
do. And Henderson again was his usual less-than-neighborly self to Langston
(15-7), winless in three complete games against the A's this season.  </LEADPARA>

LANGSTON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Together, they produced an inexplicable 3-2 victory over the Angels that
allowed the A's to remain six games behind A.L. West-leading Minnesota, a 10-5
winner over Seattle.;   Darling (3-0) reached the eighth inning for the first
time in four starts for the A's. More important, he was successful the second
time he faced the Angels, debunking the theory that pitches considered a
mystery the first time around would be easily solved the second.;   "If you
throw good pitches, it doesn't matter who's up there," Darling said. "In a
sense, it's easier for me, because they (the hitters) haven't seen me before,
but I haven't seen them.;   "I don't know. I'm not Bill James.";   In four
starts and 26 1/3 innings with the A's, Darling has allowed 16 hits and five
earned runs, for a 1.69 ERA. He has given up fewer hits and runs in four
starts than he did in his last two in the N.L., for Montreal.;   "I trusted
the people I talked to in the N.L.," Manager Tony La Russa said. "The people I
talked to were all Ron Darling fans.";   Henderson's mastery of Langston is
even stranger. Though they're next-door neighbors in Seattle, Henderson holds
squatter's rights whenever the two are together in Oakland or Anaheim.;  
Henderson went 2 for 3 against Langston, with both singles contributing to A's
runs. Henderson is 10 for 12 against Langston this season and 16 for 34 (.471)
lifetime.;   "It's more the luck of the draw. I've hit the ball, and it's
fallen in," Henderson said. "It just so happens Mark's on the mound. I
wouldn't make much more out of it than that.";   Like Darling, La Russa
referred to a baseball authority in trying to explain it.;   "That's why they
have that Elias thing, that this guy hits that guy," he said. "Everybody has
somebody -- I never had anybody -- but everyone else has somebody they hit.
That shows you how important confidence is.";   If not for Henderson, Langston
might be 18-4 and the Cy Young Award front-runner. Instead, he has come away
with losses of 4-3, 3-1 and 3-2 in his last three starts against the A's.;  
Langston also had errors to blame for Tuesday's loss.;   Both A's runs in the
third were unearned. Second baseman Luis Sojo failed to catch a high throw
from shortstop Dick Schofield in the third, negating what might have been an
inning-killing double play. Instead, Henderson's single sent Mike Bordick home
from second, and Rickey Henderson eventually scored on Terry Steinbach's
sacrifice fly.;   The fifth-inning error, though, was made by Langston. His
pickoff attempt on Rickey Henderson at second bounded into center field,
eventually leading to another run scored via a sacrifice fly.;   "It's
disappointing," Langston said. "It is very frustrating.";   Nature-defying,
too.; HOW THEY SCORED;   Angels 3rd -- Parrish was hit by a pitch, took second
on Sojo's sacrifice and third on Schofield's groundout. Polonia singled,
scoring Parrish. Angels 1, A's 0.;   A's 3rd -- With one out, Bordick walked.
R. Henderson reached first on a fielder's choice, with Bordick safe at second
on second baseman Sojo's fielding error. D. Henderson singled, scoring Bordick
and moving R. Henderson to third, and D. Henderson took second on the throw.
Canseco was walked intentionally. Steinbach's sacrifice fly scored R.
Henderson. A's 2, Angels 1.;   A's 5th -- R. Henderson walked. D. Henderson
singled, moving R. Henderson to second. R. Henderson took third and D.
Henderson second on Langston's throwing error on pickoff attempt. With one
out, Steinbach was walked intentionally. Jacoby's sacrifice fly scored R.
Henderson. A's 3, Angels 1.;   Angels 8th -- With two out, Polonia singled and
stole second and third. Abner singled, scoring Polonia. A's 3, Angels 2.;

<P>
BASEBALL: ANGEL PITCHER IS FRUSTRATED AFTER GIVING UP EIGHT WALKS AND FOUR RUNS 
IN BALTIMORE'S 9-1 VICTORY.

<P>
Few teams have walked all over Mark Langston as the Baltimore Orioles did 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when a victory by their prized left-hander might have given the 
Angels hope of reversing the skid that threatens to take them out of the 
American League West pennant race, the Angels instead reverted to the dismal 
form that has characterized their struggles during the first month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston matched a career high by issuing eight walks over six innings to the 
Orioles, who put together two walks and four singles in the fifth for the 
foundation of a 9-1 rout at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was a defeat Langston took hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed, totally embarrassed that it happened," Langston (2-3) said 
after the league's weakest-hitting team produced four runs against him on seven 
hits, all singles. The Orioles didn't manage an extra-base hit until Bill 
Ripken lined a two-run double off Mark Clear, and totaled only two. The second 
was a two-run home run in the ninth by Cal Ripken, who joined Ernie Banks and 
Vern Stephens as the only players to hit 200 home runs as a major league 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overthrowing the ball, rushing," Langston said. "It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' sixth defeat in seven games and 16th in their last 21 left them 10 
1/2 games behind the first-place Oakland Athletics, the Angels' first 
double-digit deficit of the season. Worse, it obscured the memory of Chuck 
Finley's exemplary three-hit shutout of the Orioles on Tuesday, which the 
Angels had hoped might lift them out of their funk. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they slid back. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're not in the situation we want," Langston said of the 
sixth-place Angels. "Chuck did such a great job (Tuesday) and I wanted to keep 
the ball moving. I let the team down, and that's very frustrating for myself." 
</P>
<P>
So bad did Langston deem his performance that he wondered why Oriole Manager 
Frank Robinson asked home plate umpire Larry McCoy to check the ball and his 
cap for pine tar in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Beats me why he bothered," Langston said. "I probably should have used it." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles seem to profit more by taking pitches, as shown by a league-low 
.229 batting average and a league-leading 134 walks. Langston said he felt "as 
strong as I've felt this year," but that abundance of strength didn't translate 
into the fearsome fastball and delicate control that allowed him to command $16 
million in the free-agent market last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Langston struggled from the outset but helped his cause by starting a pickoff 
in the first and was aided by Lance Parrish's throw on Phil Bradley's stolen 
base attempt in the third. He was flailing by the fifth, in which the key hits 
were Randy Milligan's two-run single and two-out RBIs by Dave Segui and Bob 
Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's just trying to do too much right now," pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann said. "It's a thing guys fall into once in a while. Bases on ball 
don't make it easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a matter of getting to the point where he's relaxing than mechanics 
and things like that. Right now, it's a matter of him not trying to do too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels couldn't do much at all against Oriole starter Pete Harnisch (3-0), 
although Harnisch owed much credit for the complete-game victory to his 
outfielders. Parrish was robbed three times, once to each field, and Dante 
Bichette's long fly ball to center with two on in the sixth was snared by Mike 
Devereaux to preserve a shutout, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The only Angel run came in the seventh, on a double by Mark McLemore and a 
single by Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chili Davis, who was one for four: "We get hits, but we're not getting key 
hits. It's tough to elaborate on things because there's going to be a lot of 
negative things, and I don't want to dwell on those. 
</P>
<P>
"This team will get hot. It's frustrating for the front office and the fans, 
but more frustrating for us because we aren't coming together as a team. But 
it's going to happen. We have to bear down and try hard and not try to do too 
much. We each have to do our individual job." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Reese, who suffered a mild heart attack last week, was released from St. 
John's Hospital in Santa Monica and is resting at home. The 85-year-old 
conditioning coach is not expected back in uniform until after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield is scheduled to undergo another Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging test today at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood to 
determine how his strained hamstring is healing. Schofield was injured during 
spring training and has yet to play this season. Reliever Bob McClure, on the 
disabled list because of a sore left elbow, threw for 15 minutes Wednesday -- 
including six minutes off the mound -- and reported no discomfort. He will 
continue to throw if no problems arise today. 
</P>
<P>
Several Anaheim Stadium employees said they had heard Wednesday that Brian 
Downing had retired and was to be paid $500,000 by the team. In truth, the 
retiree was pitcher Mike Smithson, who was released by the Angels the weekend 
before the season opened.

SKINNER TAKES PRIDE IN TAKING ADVANTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AS BACKUP TO ALL-STAR SANDY ALOMAR JR., CLEVELAND'S RESERVE CATCHER 
LOOKS TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

<P>
Joel Skinner's strategy at the plate seems to be a simple one: Ignore a 
pitcher's past glories, forget his notoriety and never consider him unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy's got a ball in his hand and you try to hit it," said Skinner, a backup 
catcher for the Cleveland Indians. "You take pride in what you're doing, that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner had reason to be proud Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in place of Sandy Alomar Jr., Cleveland's All-Star catcher who was 
sidelined by a sprained left thumb, Skinner had a double off starter Mark 
Langston, a three-run home run off reliever Willie Fraser and scored twice to 
help the Indians defeat the Angels, 8-1, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His homer to left, his first of the season, came on a 3-2 pitch in the third 
inning. It gave Indians a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, I was just trying to work myself back in the count," 
said Skinner, who was playing in only his 25th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to make contact. . . . Striking out has always been a thorn 
in my side. My ratio is not all that good." 
</P>
<P>
Going into Sunday's game, Skinner, a former standout at Mission Bay High School 
in San Diego, had struck out 24 times in 66 at-bats. The last time the Indians 
met the Angels in Cleveland, July 1-2, Skinner struck out four times in five 
at-bats, but also received a bases-loaded walk. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he faced Langston, on May 30 at Anaheim, Skinner drove in two 
runs with a single in a 4-2 Cleveland victory. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner shrugged when asked about his success against Langston, whose record 
fell to 4-12 with the loss Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a tough pitcher over my career," said Skinner, 29, and a six-year 
veteran of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have much luck against him when he was in Seattle. I think coming 
into this year, I only had one or two hits against him." 
</P>
<P>
But Skinner was sharp Sunday. After Felix Fermin grounded to third to lead off 
the second inning, Skinner hit a breaking ball down the left-field line for a 
double. He scored on Jerry Browne's single to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Skinner also played a part in an impressive outing by starter Greg 
Swindell, who improved to 6-5 after giving up six hits and one run in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He did real well," Swindell said of his catcher. "I think with him and Sandy, 
we have two of the best catchers in the league. I tend to know him better than 
I know Sandy anyway, so it was nothing (to pitch to him). I never had to shake 
him off once." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said it was just a matter of making the most of his opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"You just try to contribute," he said. "You can't go out and play for yourself 
-- that's a key part of being professional. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing people don't realize is that it's a lot of fun to play. And when you 
get to, you make the most of it so you can keep playing."

DOUBT GOES EARLY IN LANGSTON LOSS 
</P>

SEATTLE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels hoped they had signed a 20-game winner when they agreed to pay Mark 
Langston $16 million over five years last winter. Instead, they could have a 
20-game loser. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly excited about his second visit to the Kingdome to face his former 
Seattle Mariner teammates, Langston was as prepared as he had ever been for a 
game. But he wasn't ready for his dismal performance Friday night, as he gave 
up six runs in 2 2/3 innings as the Mariners rocked him and rolled past the 
Angels, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I had better stuff tonight than the last time I pitched here," he said, 
referring to a 2-1 loss July 11. "I had better stuff than I had my last couple 
starts. I was very pumped up for this game. I was ready to turn it around 
tonight and it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Mariners collected seven hits off Langston in sending him to his 
eighthconsecutive defeat and the Angels' fifth in their last six games. Erik 
Hanson (11-8) and Gene Harris held the Angels to four hits as the club's record 
fell to 1-4 halfway through its 10-game, three-city trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We were flat and got off to a bad start and it was compounded. That's it," 
second baseman Johnny Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a flurry of transactions, the Angels announced after the game they 
had optioned third baseman Jack Howell to Edmonton and recalled infielder Kent 
Anderson. Howell had five hits in his last 35 at-bats to reduce his batting 
average to .208. Anderson, who was sent to Edmonton on June 30, hit .271 in 18 
games with the Trappers and had seven RBIs. That's six more RBIs than he 
produced for the Angels in 30 games before he was sent out. 
</P>
<P>
They also recalled center fielder Devon White, sending out relief pitcher Scott 
Bailes. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in 10 starts and eight decisions, since a 6-4 victory at Kansas City on 
June 5, Langston's 4-13 record puts him on track for the Angel record of 19 
losses, set in 1973 by Clyde Wright and matched a year later by Frank Tanana. 
Perhaps most disheartening for the 29-year-old left-hander is that each of his 
past two starts has lasted a mere 2 2/3 innings and has been marked by 
surrendering six runs. In his last six starts, he has given up 29 earned runs 
over 35 innings, an earned-run average of 7.46. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, which Langston no-hit for seven innings on April 11 for his first 
Angel victory, batted around and scored four times in the first, an inning 
highlighted by Jeffrey Leonard's two-run double. Edgar Martinez added a home 
run in the third, and Omar Vizquel drove in the final run off Langston with a 
double to right, sending him to the dugout to the accompaniment of a chorus of 
boos and derisive cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard them like that," Langston said of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he's never pitched like this. "It's a gut-check," he said of his 
streak. "I've never experienced anything like this, and it's very, very 
frustrating. I want to help this team, and I felt I would be able to help this 
team when I came here. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work ahead very well, and for me to be effective and my pitches to 
work, I have to work ahead in the count. Then I can be aggressive. If I'm ahead 
two strikes, then I have some room to mess around. I threw some very good 
sliders tonight, but they laid off. They were going to make me throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't throw many. "If you get behind, location becomes everything," catcher 
Lance Parrish said. "He's certainly not fooling people at this point, so he has 
to concentrate on his location. He's got good stuff. Most of the time a guy 
with stuff like that can get by with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bad as his ordeal has been -- and on Friday he acknowledged how he has tossed 
and turned and replayed losses in his mind -- Langston is determined not to be 
beaten mentally. "I don't thinkmechanically there's too much more I can do," he 
said. "I made one adjustment (in hisdelivery) that was a good adjustment. I 
just somehow have to break through. I will never givein. I will not give in." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
After outfielder Devon White was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Thursday, 
he was in Friday's original lineup but scratched because of stiffness in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a little soul-searching," White said of his 14-game Edmonton stint, 
which began when he was optioned on July 6. "I went down there and I did what I 
had to do. . . . I took a lot of extra batting practice and before I left, 
(Dave) Winfield gave me some pointers." White hit .364 with four doubles, four 
triples and six RBIs in Edmonton after hitting .213 for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Bailes, who will make four or five starts for Edmonton, took the news well. 
"Everyone knows I need to get in some innings, and the way it's been going I 
wasn't going to get them in here," said the 27-year-old left-hander, whose 
earned-run average had jumped to 6.37. "I was tense out there. When they told 
me, it felt like 500 pounds had been taken off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hired Tony Seigle, former vice president of player personnel for the 
Padres, to handle special assignments regarding scouting and player personnel. 
Seigle has also worked for the Phillies, Brewers and Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Mark Eichhorn, who has given up 16 earned runs in 9 1/3 innings in 10 
appearances since June 21, attributed his woes to bad habits he fell into after 
his successful start. "Because I'm not pitching as often as earlier, I got in a 
couple of mechanical ruts," he said. "I've looked at tapes and hopefully I can 
correct a few things." . . . Jim Abbott is featured as "One of baseball's most 
eligible bachelors" in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. The article, 
entitled, "Baseball's most gorgeous hunks," describes Abbott as "tall, 
bright-eyed, strong and brave." Abbott took considerable kidding about it from 
his teammates. "It's a good thing they wrote about him because he needs all the 
help he can get," Chuck Finley said.

LANGSTON DOESN'T BLAME TEAMMATES FOR HIS 4-11 MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' paltry offensive efforts in his support are unfortunate, Mark 
Langston says, but he doesn't believe they are the product of resentment toward 
him as a newcomer or his $16 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who was a free agent when he signed a five-year deal with the Angels 
last winter, has lost his last six decisions, is 1-8 with three no-decisions 
since a victory May 15 at Milwaukee and is 4-11 overall. During his 19 starts 
this season, opponents have outscored the Angels, 57-45, while he was in the 
game. His next start is Sunday against Cleveland at Anaheim Stadium, where he 
is 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," he said when asked if jealousy might play a part, however 
subconscious, in his teammates' stingy production. "I've never felt that. There 
have just been some tough losses. If there is, they keep it to themselves. I 
haven't seen it. Maybe it's something you (reporters) think about, but I don't. 
They realize I'm a human being and I'm out there competing like everyone else. 
I'm the first to admit I wish things were a lot different than what they are, 
but you win as a team and you lose as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Langston said his Christian faith helps him endure. "I pray to the Lord and put 
a lot of it on Him," the 29-year-old left-hander said. "I go out with the 
ability He gave me and do my best to pitch as capably as I can. The results 
haven't been there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Every game I'm going out expecting to win. I feel every time I go out there I 
have a very good opportunity to win and I look forward to every one of my 
starts. I've never been one to put that much pressure on myself. I'm a poor 
loser and I don't like to lose. I'll never be satisfied with losing. That's 
what's been frustrating through this whole ordeal. Even though I pitch decent, 
I've made mistakes and they've turned out to be big mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' offense hasn't given him -- or Jim Abbott -- much room for error, 
but he refused to condemn his teammates. "This is a team-oriented situation. 
You can't blame one person," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't feel compelled to satisfy observers who expect him to put up big 
numbers because of the numbers on his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, my contract is large," he said, "but what they pay me for is to 
give the best I can give. That doesn't guarantee anything, which is sad. I give 
everything I've got every start I have, and the way I look at it, that's what 
I'm paid for." 
</P>
<P>
After his last start, a 3-1 loss to Milwaukee on Monday, Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said Langston was pitching well enough to be on the verge of 10 
consecutive victories. Langston smiled at the thought, but he isn't thinking in 
such grandiose terms. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be very nice, but I've got to win one before I can win 10," he 
said. "I have to look at it one game at a time."

ANGELS' MCCASKILL DEFEATS YANKEES, 4-2, CUTS ERA TO 2.96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the public fixes its gaze on the pitcher who might win 20 games and the 
pitcher who might lose 20, Kirk McCaskill presses on. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley has won 15 games, and Mark Langston has lost 15. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill is merely 8-8 after the Angels' 4-2 victory Monday over New York in 
front of 28,387 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But his ordinary record obscures an extraordinary earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's 2.96 ERA is the fourth best in the American League, surpassed only 
by those of Roger Clemens, Finley, and Dave Stewart, all likely 20-game 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who gave up one run on six hits in seven innings Friday, has 
fashioned this ERA despite pitching with bone spurs in his right elbow. He 
expects to have surgery the day after the season ends, or even the day after 
his final start, if the team approves. His victory Monday was his first career 
win over the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
His name disappears and reappears in the ERA standings because the number of 
innings he has pitched barely qualify him. But with his start each week, he 
usually pulls back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's tendency to find himself in 2-1 games and a sometime loser because 
of lack of support has been much documented. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill has seen his share too. In Monday's game, he led, 2-1, from the third 
inning until the Angels scored two runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Three times that he has pitched, the Angels have played 2-1 games, winning one. 
</P>
<P>
In his eight losses, the Angels have scored five runs at the time of his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill defended himself Monday, getting out of a spot in the seventh when 
the Yankees put runners on first and third with none out. 
</P>
<P>
He got Bob Geren to chase a low, outside pitch, hitting it to third base where 
Jesse Barfield was caught in a rundown. He got the second out by getting Matt 
Nokes to pop to short, and the third by striking out Roberto Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who were guaranteed not to fall into last place in the American 
League West only by virtue of Minnesota's day off, had a 2-0 lead after two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee starter Chuck Cary, who would last only two innings before being removed 
with back spasms, walked the first batter he faced, Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
Downing went to third on Donnie Hill's single, and scored on Lance Parrish's 
two-out single. Lee Stevens grounded to second, stranding two runners. 
</P>
<P>
Cary, the only Yankee pitcher to win consecutive starts this season, had not 
won a game since June 19, spanning nine starts. He didn't give himself an 
opportunity to win this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels put runners on first and third in the second inning on Dick 
Schofield's walk and Downing's single. 
</P>
<P>
Cary let Schofield come home when he threw a wild pitch, way high, enabling 
Schofield to slide in safe ahead of catcher Bob Geren's throw from the backstop 
to Cary, who had moved in to cover the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Downing took second on the play, but Hill flied out to end the inning. Cary was 
through, removed as a precautionary measure because of the muscle spasms in his 
back, according to a report from the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got a run back in the third inning, trimming the lead to 2-1 on two 
singles and a groundout. Oscar Azocar's two-out single to center drove in 
Alvaro Espinoza, who had singled and taken second on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels wasted a fine opportunity to break the unsteady grip of their 2-1 
lead, loading the bases with one out in the fifth inning on singles by Dave 
Winfield and Lance Parrish and Lee Stevens' walk. 
</P>
<P>
They walked away empty-handed after Devon White struck out and Kent Anderson 
grounded to short. 
</P>
<P>
White, sent to triple-A Edmonton last month to work on his hitting and 
discipline at the plate, seemed much improved when he returned, going eight for 
his 27 in his first six games back. But in the past seven games before Monday, 
he had gone five for 30, including 11 consecutive hitless at-bats entering 
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels led, 4-1, after eight innings, before Jesse Barfield's solo homer, 
his 16th, to left off Bryan Harvey cut it to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The homer was only the second this season allowed by Harvey, who had not 
allowed one in 40 innings covering 30 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey pitched the eighth and ninth for his 14th save.

Angel Notes

Mark Langston says one of the most difficult things about his 15 losses this 
season is the wait for the next start and the possibility it brings for putting 
the last behind him. There will be no long wait this time. Langston, who gave 
up eight runs in 2 2/3 innings Sunday, will start Wednesday on two days' rest. 
He will replace Bert Blyleven, who will skip a start after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his strained right shoulder Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the ball any time they want to give it to me," Langston said. "I 
didn't do that much work (Sunday). I don't think that will have any effect." 
Langston (5-15) threw only 64 pitches Sunday, his 10th loss in his past 11 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, whose next start will be Saturday, said the chance for him to skip a 
start will be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said he believes he has corrected several mechanical flaws in his 
complicated delivery, and that he "felt sound (Sunday) for the first time in a 
long time" despite his poor performance. Langston said he was consoled by 
pitchers Blyleven, Kirk McCaskill and Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"They really picked me up," he said, also including Manager Doug Rader. "I was 
down. . . . The more you talk about it, the easier it is to get rid of it."

LANGSTON A WINNER AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: LEFT-HANDER ENDS HIS EIGHT-GAME LOSING STREAK BY HOLDING OFF THE TWINS 
IN AN 11-5 VICTORY AT METRODOME.

<P>
Never did Mark Langston give in to despair. 
</P>
<P>
There were, during his eight-game losing streak, days that he wondered when the 
light might break the cloud of futility that enveloped him. Langston's 
religious faith lifted those doubts and his faith in his pitching ability 
carried him past some rough spots Wednesday, when he earned his first victory 
since June 5 in the Angels' 11-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins at the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"Three starts ago, the game at home, was about as rock bottom as I got," 
Langston said, referring to a 2 2/3-inning outing against Cleveland on July 22 
in which he allowed six runs. "I'd been pitching good enough to lose, and then 
I had the blowout game at home and I was very clue-less. I was on my knees 
(praying) quite a bit that whole night trying to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"What answers did I come to? Just don't give in. Never give in. Each game 
you've got a chance to do it. You can go one direction or the other -- give in 
or battle and come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Langston (5-13) battled himself as much as he battled the Twins, slipping back 
into his dangerous habit of trying to make the perfect pitch instead of the 
most expedient. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-run lead presented him by his teammates in the third inning gave him 
some leeway. It was three more runs than they scored in his last four starts 
combined. He used almost all of it, needing help from Willie Fraser and Bryan 
Harvey to preserve the victory that put the Angels back in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
With victories in three of their past four games, the Angels finished a 4-6 
trip with renewed self-respect. For no one was that more true than Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very flustrating, the whole ordeal," he said, "but I got a win, and 
I think I needed to win a game whether it was 1-0 or today's game. I'll 
definitely appreciate wins more than I ever have in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Langston got over the hump in the fifth when he escaped trouble by showing a 
resolve he admittedly has lacked. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels finished off Minnesota starter Roy Smith (5-9) by scoring three 
times in the second and four more in the third. The highlight was Bill 
Schroeder's two-run double in the second and Schroeder's fourth home run of the 
season in the third. But the Twins, with Langston throwing them mostly 
fastballs, scored a run in the fourth and added three in the fifth on two 
singles, a triple by Nelson Liriano and a double by Kirby Puckett to cut the 
Angels' lead to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett stood on second with none out and the fourth, fifth and sixth hitters 
coming up, creating a moment of truth for Langston. He knew the game could be 
determined by his next few pitches, and his determination to win prevailed. 
Langston got Gene Larkin to fly to left, Brian Harper to right and Kent Hrbek 
to center. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost played right into their hands," he said. "Instead of changing speeds 
and doing the things I'd been doing, I kept throwing harder and harder and they 
kept hitting it. With a big lead like that, the last thing I wanted to do was 
let them creep back into the game. I was lucky, basically, that I got out of 
the inning. It could have been even worse than it was." 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse in the eighth, after the Twins cut the Angels' lead to 
8-5 and had runners on first and third with one out. Harvey came in and walked 
pinch-hitter Randy Bush, but Al Newman hit the first pitch for an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's earned-run average climbed to 4.28. And in his last three games he 
has given up 16 earned runs in 11 1/3 innings, an ERA of 12.71. That mattered 
less to him and his teammates than the knowledge that he finally succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start, particularly since he had to sweat it out in the eighth," Brian 
Downing said. "He was a hit away from a no-decision. It's like a hitter in a 
slump who gets one bloop hit that turns it around -- maybe that'll work for 
him, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He struggled, but we got him a lot of runs and got him a win for a change. 
Maybe this is a good omen for him. It's a big negative off his back." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is positive he can again learn to enjoy winning. "It's been awhile, a 
real long while. I forgot the feeling, to tell you the truth," he said. "It's a 
real good feeling, even as bad as it was. . . . It was ugly, but I've got a 
smile on my face." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said the club salvaged what could have been a 
disastrous trip by winning two of three games in Minnesota. "There were great 
hopes for this trip because it was very important, as is the home stand," he 
said. "The way it started out (losing three of four in Oakland and two of three 
in Seattle) we did fine, because let's face it, those first two stops weren't 
too good." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Harper's fourth-inning double for Minnesota stretched his hitting streak 
to 22 games, the longest in the American League this season. St. Louis' Willie 
McGee also has a 22-game streak. The longest streak in the majors this season 
was 23 games by the Phillies' Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring 11 runs Wednesday and 13 on Tuesday, the Angels hit double figures 
in runs in back-to-back games for the first time since May 21 and 24 of 1989. . 
. . The Angels hit .296 on this trip (106 for 358) and scored 51 runs, but 
their pitchers gave up 49 earned runs in 86 1/3 innings, for an earned-run 
average of 5.11. 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he wasn't bothered by two runners being caught in rundowns and 
another thrown out stealing. "It's important for us to show more outward 
physical exuberance and be willing to take more chances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia's second-inning single ended his 0-for-13 drought and improved his 
mood. "If I go 0-for one game I go crazy," said Polonia, whose two-for-five day 
raised his average to .302. "And look who it's against: guys like (Monday's 
starter Kevin) Tapani or however you say it. There ain't no Cy Youngs there. 
It's OK if you're talking (Mark) Gubicza, (Bret) Saberhagen and (Roger) 
Clemens." . . . Outfielder Max Venable is hampered by corns on his feet and has 
not started the past four games.

YANKEES SOLVE LANGSTON, 5-2; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER BEATING NEW YORK LAST SUNDAY, ANGEL PITCHER GIVES UP MORE RUNS 
THAN IN ANY OF HIS FIVE STARTS THIS SEASON.

<P>
The supposed comforts of home weren't very comforting to the Angels Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the friendly confines of Anaheim Stadium after a two-week, 13-game trek 
across North America, the Angels did little to reward the 36,703 fans who 
welcomed their return. Mark Langston was tagged by the New York Yankees for 
five runs, the most he has allowed in any of his five starts this season, and 
the Angels' offense barely stirred in his support, resulting in the Yankees' 
5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The key hit against Langston (2-2) was a three-run home run to right-center in 
the sixth by Jesse Barfield, his fourth homer of the season. Langston, who was 
a 4-3 winner over the Yankees last Sunday in New York, hit one batter, walked 
four and struck out five as the Yankees ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee left-hander Dave LaPoint (2-2) went the minimum five innings to get the 
victory. He gave up only three hits, as the Angels managed only five overall. 
They are 3-6 in their last nine games and 5-11 in their last 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels entered the game with a team batting average of .236, tied for 13th 
in the American League, and they did nothing to improve it against Yankee 
pitchers LaPoint, Alan Mills, Lee Guetterman and Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia's triple and Devon White's sacrifice fly created the first run, 
which was the Angels' only run until Chili Davis walked against Righetti and 
Dante Bichette doubled him home. That extended Bichette's hitting streak to 10 
games. It also set a club record as the 22nd consecutive game in which the 
Angels have had at least one double. The previous record of 21 was set in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees opened their scoring in the third inning. Steve Sax walked with one 
out and stole second as Roberto Kelly struck out swinging. Don Mattingly, one 
of the few left-handed hitters to own a solid career batting average against 
Langston (.289 before this season), scored Sax with a single to center, winning 
the $35.5-million matchup (Langston's $16-million, five-year contract combined 
with Mattingly's $19.3-million, five-year pact). 
</P>
<P>
Before Langston's start against the Yankees Friday, left-handed hitters were 
only two for 17 against Langston this season. 
</P>
<P>
LaPoint, who lasted only two innings against the Angels last Sunday, retired 10 
consecutive hitters after Polonia. Wally Joyner ended that streak in the fourth 
with a one-out walk. Davis followed with a single and after Dante Bichette 
flied out to center, the Angels loaded the bases when third baseman Mike 
Blowers could not field Lance Parrish's dribbler up the line. The error was 
Blowers' fifth in two games, but LaPoint got out of the inning by getting a 
third strike past Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Angel hitters are one for 10 in bases-loaded situations this season. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to produce a run in that situation proved important when the 
Yankees managed to a run in the fifth. Blowers led off with a walk and stole 
second. Challenging the six-assist arm of Bichette in right field, Blowers 
tagged on Alvaro Espinoza's fly ball to right and made it easily when 
Bichette's throw was off-line. Blowers had to hold when Sax grounded out, but 
he scored when Kelly rapped a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got to Langston for three runs in the sixth, and their total of 
five earned runs was the most Langston had allowed this season. Langston struck 
out Mattingly but hit Steve Balboni on the hand and yielded a sharp single to 
Winfield before Jesse Barfield hit a 1-2 pitch to right-center for his fourth 
home run of the season. Langston ended the inning by striking out Blowers, his 
third victim, but the damage had been done. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Mills, once the Angels' property, relieved LaPoint in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson, now a TV commentator on KTLA, gave Yankee outfielder Dave 
Winfield a hard time while the Yankees were doing their pregame stretching. "So 
you're a part-timer now," Jackson began, as Winfield, who missed the 1989 
season after undergoing back surgery, did his calisthenics. "You know what 
happens when they make you the DH. That's how they ran me out of baseball. . . 
. Don't leave anything on the warning track tonight because you know what 
people are going to say. They're going to say, 'Years ago, that would have gone 
out.' " The other Yankees smiled, giving Jackson more fuel. "The guys that are 
laughing the hardest are thinking the same thing," Jackson said. "Oh, and you 
know I need you for an interview?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's jesting may have inspired Winfield. He ended a career-worst 0-for-23 
streak in the fourth, with a single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
To the delight of Angel newcomer Luis Polonia, Donnie Hill gave Polonia uniform 
number 22 -- which means Polonia can keep the ornate gold "22" charm he wears 
around his neck instead of selling it to Hill. "I figured I'd have to change my 
whole wardrobe if he gave it to me," said Hill, who took 18. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia was even more delighted to be in the starting lineup Friday against a 
left-hander. He showed his gratitude by leading off the game with a triple, the 
Angels' first triple of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. That's telling me I don't have to think about whether I'm playing 
or not," he said. "That was the tough thing for me -- I'd be home and then come 
to the game and see I'm not in the lineup. Now I don't have to think about it 
or read the paper to see who's pitching. I'm going to be there and I'm going to 
do my job day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston and his wife, Michelle, will provide the voices for two 
characters in an animated action-adventure TV series, "Captain Planet and the 
Planeteers." Langston will be the voice of "The Nuclear Computer," while his 
wife will be the voice of a TV anchor on a segment entitled "The Meltdown 
Syndrome."

'WE WILL GET MARK DAVIS,' LAWYER FOR PADRES SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Chicago-based attorney retained by Padre owner Joan Kroc to 
handle negotiations with free-agent pitcher Mark Davis, said Wednesday that the 
Padres will sign Davis. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been no progress in Lane's negotiations with Alan Hendricks, 
Davis' agent, and Wednesday Hendricks was more interested in the deals of other 
players such as Minnesota's Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
Lane also said he has been in touch with Arn Tellem, Mark Langston's agent, and 
expects to be in a position to make an offer to Langston sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
As for Davis, Lane and Hendricks talked earlier this week, but Lane didn't make 
an offer. Lane said he now figures to make one toward the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to get Mark Davis . . . we will get Mark Davis," Lane 
said. "We will get him, and it will be a fair arrangement for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because we want him, and he wants us," Lane said. "We'll work it out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hendricks: "I'm happy they feel that way. That's nice. Somebody is going 
to get him. I'm not pulling for or against the San Diego Padres. But I have to 
worry about what's best for Mark Davis and his family. If that's concurrent 
with what's best for the San Diego Padres, I'd be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Lane originally planned to make an offer to Hendricks Monday but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only make a deal with people who are prepared to listen," he said. "They 
need to do more shopping." 
</P>
<P>
With every new player signing this winter, that shopping list becomes more 
complicated for the Padres. Puckett, who wasn't eligible yet for free agency, 
agreed to a three-year, $9-million contract Wednesday. The Yankees signed 
free-agent pitcher Pascual Perez, 9-13 for Montreal last season, to a 
three-year contract worth $5.7 million Tuesday. Friday, Kansas City signed 
pitcher Bret Saberhagen, the American League Cy Young award winner, to a 
three-year contract extension for $8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Padres) can make their proposal any time they want," Hendricks said. 
"They seem to want to wait until they see what the market is. Puckett and Perez 
have signed in the last 24 hours, and Saberhagen, (Nick) Esasky and (Kevin) 
Bass have all signed. That's what the market is to me." 
</P>
<P>
Two free agents were signed last week: Atlanta signed Esasky, a first baseman, 
to a deal reported to be worth $5.7 million over three years, and San Francisco 
signed Bass, an outfielder, to a three-year package worth $5.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen and Perez, both starting pitchers, are most relevant to Davis, the 
National League Cy Young Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I read last week where a reliever won't command as much money as a starter, 
but that viewpoint isn't shared by very many clubs," Hendricks said. "As a 
matter of fact, some clubs have told me that a reliever is worth more than a 
starter because he's in more games and has more opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is seeking a four-year contract for what sources have said is as much as 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract's length is important, and that has been well-chronicled," 
Hendricks said. "We've got to solve that. I'm of the opinion that Mark Davis is 
as valuable as anybody on the free agent market." 
</P>
<P>
A New York newspaper reported last week that the Yankees had made an offer for 
Davis, but Hendricks wouldn't confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything publicly that will help or hinder the process," 
Hendricks said. "All I will confirm is that we have a lot of interested teams, 
and that shouldn't be shocking news to anybody. They know we have a stated 
asking price, and whoever meets it will get him. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said he would like to have Davis signed by the end of the winter 
meetings, which are Dec. 2-7 in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
As for Langston, Lane said he and Tellem discussed terms Tuesday, but the 
Padres will not make a formal offer until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Men who have top-flight pitchers seem to be checking the market out 
thoroughly," Lane said.

ANGELS BLOW AN 8-4 LEAD, WIN, 9-8, IN 16

First Dave Winfield kept the Angels in a game they had won for seven innings, 
nearly lost in the eighth and then were forced to work overtime to gain some 
semblence of control. His catch in the 14th inning kept the game under control. 
</P>
<P>
Then he scored the winning run in the 16th inning on Dante Bichette's topper to 
give the Angels a 9-8 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night in the 
longest game of the season for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton was the winning pitcher after being activated from the disabled 
list earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Wags here say the Brewers' emblem, which features a ball nestled safely in a 
glove, would be more accurate if it depicted a ball falling out of that glove. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers are the American League's worst fielding team, and they showed how 
richly they deserve that distinction Friday when they committed six errors. 
</P>
<P>
The errors gave Milwaukee 87 for the season. The Angels are second-worst at 76. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by the six Milwaukee errors, the Angels scored more runs for pitcher Mark 
Langston Friday than they did in his last five starts. That was all to no avail 
because Langston, who had lost his last four decisions, was unable to protect 
leads of 5-2 and 8-4. In his last 10 starts since he was an 8-3 winner over 
Milwaukee on May 15, Langston is 1-6 with three no-decisions. Overall, the 
29-year-old left-hander is 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with seven earned runs Friday in 7 2/3 innings, raising 
his earned-run average to 3.71. He walked five and struck out four for a total 
of 107 strikeouts in 119 innings. He leads the Angel staff in innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
The six errors -- which included a hat trick on three routine plays by 
shortstop Kiki Diaz -- tied a Brewers' club record set on July 26, 1978, 
against the Angels. The muffs undermined the efforts of starter Dennis Powell 
and reliever Jaime Navarro and rendered seven of the Angels' eight runs 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
The only untainted run resulted from Dave Winfield's two-run home run in the 
sixth inning, Winfield's 10th homer of the season. It followed an error by 
third baseman Gary Sheffield on a grounder by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on the springboard of second 
baseman Jim Gantner's error on a grounder by leadoff hitter Brian Downing. 
Lance Parrish drew a bases-loaded walk to force in the first run, and Dante 
Bichette drove in two more with a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee got two runs back in the bottom of the inning when Langston struggled 
with his control. He walked three, then yielded a two-run single to Greg Brock 
with two out, continuing his habit of allowing a high percentage of two-out 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz's first error, on a Dave Winfield grounder, allowed Downing to score for a 
4-2 Angel lead after he had walked, moved to second on a single and to third on 
a grounder. The Angels added a run in the third inning when Bichette doubled 
and scored when Diaz threw away Jack Howell's grounder for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers cut their deficit to 5-4 in the fifth. Singles by Diaz and 
Sheffield put runners on first and second, and Dave Parker -- Milwaukee's lone 
representative in Tuesday's All-Star Game -- drove them in with a double that 
rolled past the glove of center fielder Bichette. Winfield, the right fielder, 
recovered in time to throw back to the infield where a relay beat Parker to 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's home run into the left-field seats gave the Angels a 7-4 lead, and 
they added a run in the seventh inning on singles by Howell and Schofield and 
an error by Sveum, who had replaced the hapless Diaz at short. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee erased that lead by batting around in the eighth against Langston and 
Mark Eichhorn. All of their runs were scored with two out, and the tying run 
scored on Sheffield's perfectly executed squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The danger began when Rob Deer walked with one out. Brock doubled past Wally 
Joyner at first, sending Deer to third. The Angels turned Greg Vaughn's 
fielder's choice grounder into an out at home, although Deer didn't appear to 
touch the plate and catcher Lance Parrish didn't appear to tag him. 
</P>
<P>
The inning continued when B.J. Surhoff lined a single past Langston's head, 
scoring Brock and moving Vaughn to third. That was all for Langston, who threw 
124 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn struggled through the rest of the inning. Sveum singled to center, 
scoring Vaughn, and Jim Gantner singled to right, scoring Surhoff. Sheffield 
scored Sveum with the fourth run of the inning when he bunted toward third, a 
slow roller Jack Howell charged but couldn't play in time to first. Robin Yount 
ended the inning by grounding into a force play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels loaded the bases in the ninth by working out three walks (one 
intentional) against Milwaukee reliever Dan Plesac, but the Brewers got out of 
that jam with a rare bit of fine fielding. The Brewers pitched carefully to 
Dick Schofield before walking him to get to Downing, and Downing vindicated 
that decision by bouncing into a double play, third to home to first. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bryan Harvey left the club to be with his father, Stan, who suffered a 
mild heart attack Thursday in North Carolina. A club spokesman said Harvey will 
get as much time off as necessary. Stan Harvey, 47, was in guarded condition 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said Harvey's absence had some influence on his decision to 
activate Greg Minton off the 60-day disabled list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Minton arrived at County Stadium at 12:30 p.m. planning to run and pitch in a 
simulated game, not expecting to be activated. "I walk in and Doug says, 'We're 
not going to simulate you today. We're going to stimulate you,' " Minton said.

MIKE PENNER: PORT EMPTIES POCKETS WITH BOLDEST MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You pay 16 mil and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston on the mound, but you shouldn't stop yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels looked back in time and far into the '90s all at once Friday 
afternoon as they completed what easily ranks as the boldest move of the Mike 
Port era. Hello, Mark Langston. Halo Mark Langston. Sixteen million buys a lot 
of fastballs these days. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the Angels used to do it. This was the Buzzie Bavasi buzz-saw 
approach to baseball -- annual shoot-outs at high noon with George Steinbrenner 
for the biggest free agents in the land. 
</P>
<P>
That it failed more often than it worked is a lesson that had altered the 
course of Angel history during the past decade. Memories of Bill Travers and 
John D'Acquisto die hard, and once they added Reggie Jackson to the payroll in 
1982, the Angels sought safe asylum from the free-agent wars. 
</P>
<P>
We would build from within, the Port credo read. 
</P>
<P>
We would hazard no risk. 
</P>
<P>
We would be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
After tentatively testing the waters last winter and getting the chill from 
Nolan Ryan and Bruce Hurst, the Angels finally decided to damn the torpedoes 
Friday. More than just taking the plunge, the Angels went in cannonball style. 
</P>
<P>
No one gets five-year contracts anymore? 
</P>
<P>
No one makes more than Rickey Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
They do now. 
</P>
<P>
Time out should be taken to commend Port and Gene Autry for doing the right 
thing. Considering that the Oakland Athletics still reside in the American 
League West, it was really the only thing. At least now, the Angels can say 
they have a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't let them say they're done. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Angels still lack anyone approaching the offensive talents 
of Jose Canseco. Or Rickey Henderson. Or Mark McGwire. Or Carney Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
No one currently wearing a halo is going to contend for a batting championship 
any time soon. No one is applying for admission into any 40-40 club. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels don't even have a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Steps remain to be taken before thoughts of catching the A's can be undertaken. 
Langston was an important one, but let it only be the first one. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any money left for Robin Yount? 
</P>
<P>
As long as the Angels are in the mood, a second strike is in order. Yount, 
baseball's next $3-million man, is presently renegotiating with his present 
employers, the Milwaukee Brewers. Reportedly, Brewer General Manager Harry 
Dalton recently asked Yount what it would take to re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Yount replied, "Sign Mark Langston." 
</P>
<P>
If Yount still wants to share clubhouse space with Langston, he knows where to 
look. 
</P>
<P>
If not, the Angels, at last, have some bargaining power at the trade table. 
They have a surplus of designated hitters (Brian Downing and Chili Davis), a 
surplus of second basemen (Johnny Ray and Mark McLemore) and, now, a surplus of 
starting pitching. 
</P>
<P>
A package for Joe Carter or Vince Coleman or Eric Davis or Danny Tartabull is 
no longer out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
The new question is: Which starting pitcher to trade? Mike Witt is the obvious 
choice, but his dreadful 1989 numbers (9-15, 4.54) have diminished his market 
value. The Angels' best hope is finding a buyer willing to take a flyer on a 
still-young (29) former ace who won 16 games as recently as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With old right-hander Bert Blyleven and young left-handers Chuck Finley and Jim 
Abbott entrenched in the rotation, Kirk McCaskill's name might start making the 
rounds. Getting by more on finesse than power since his 1987 and 1988 arm 
problems, McCaskill's 15-10 record last season reopened some eyes. Kansas City, 
among others, is said to have a keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels can also use some help in the bullpen, and there's the Lance Parrish 
matter to attend to, so if Port is truly intent on closing the gap in the AL 
West, his work has really just started. 
</P>
<P>
But Langston is some first domino. He was the one everybody in Nashville was 
waiting to see drop, the action that had to be taken before 25 other teams 
could react. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the games may begin. 
</P>
<P>
And who would have cast the Angels as trend-setters, as catalysts? Finally, for 
the first time under Port, the safety of the sidelines has been abandoned for a 
spot in the front line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Big A stands for aggressive.

MARK DAVIS WILL NOT RETURN TO SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: FINAL SESSION TO KEEP CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER GOES NOWHERE. TEAM SIGNS 
LEFFERTS AS LEFT-HANDED STOPPER.

<P>
There was one last-ditch negotiating session Thursday, but when Jack McKeon 
hung up the telephone in his hotel suite, he said it officially is over. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis, the 1989 free-agent Cy Young reliever who saved 44 games, no longer 
is wanted by the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of the free-agent business," said McKeon, manager and vice president 
of baseball operations for the Padres. "There are no hard feelings. He was 
looking out for his best interest, and I was looking out for mine. We gave him 
every chance in the world, and he didn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon added: "Our left-handed stopper now is Craig Lefferts." 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts, who had a career-high 20 saves for the San Francisco Giants this 
season, signed a three-year, $5.4-million contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He will share the stopper's role with right-hander Greg Harris, who has six 
saves in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, Monday night rejected the 
Padres' final offer of four years for $12 million. Davis insisted on a 
five-year contract. Padre owner Joan Kroc insisted on four. 
</P>
<P>
"She's made it clear that it's over," McKeon said, "so we've just got to go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has not returned telephone calls for the past two weeks, must decide 
where to take his services. He already has five-year guaranteed contracts 
awaiting him from the Montreal Expos, New York Yankees and Philadelphia 
Phillies. And who knows? The Angels just might be in this hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The termination of Davis' career in San Diego culminates nine months of botched 
negotiations. Davis offered to sign a two-year extension for $2.8 million this 
spring, and sources said he would have signed for as little as $2.4 million. 
But Padre President Dick Freeman refused to budge from his $2.2 million 
counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
There were no negotiations again until the end of the season. The Padres then 
made four offers: three years for $5 million; three years for $5.4 million; 
three years for $6.9 million, and finally, four years for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as free-agent starter Mark Langston signed a five-year, $16-million 
contract with the Angels, Davis demanded a five-year contract exceeding 
Langston's. 
</P>
<P>
With negotiations at a stalemate, Kroc put McKeon in charge of all baseball 
operations Sunday. He met for about an hour Monday with the Hendricks brothers, 
and the next time they talked on Thursday, the agents asked McKeon to 
reconsider, to no avail.

LANGSTON FINALLY GETS SHUTOUT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE THROWS A FOUR-HITTER IN THE ANGELS' 9-0 VICTORY OVER THE TWINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mark Langston's mastery of the Minnesota Twins Tuesday night came far too late 
to affect the American League West division race, but the rediscovery of his 
poise and control has come in time for him to grab a few shreds of hope from an 
otherwise dreadful season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a real flustrating year. It hasn't gone too well from my 
standpoint, and the one thing I want to do is finish strong and come out next 
year and be more aggressive," Langston said after he and the Angels overpowered 
the Twins, 9-0, before a crowd of 21,908. It was only his third victory in 15 
starts this season at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to finish consistent and let the team behind me know I can do the 
job and get a little confidence in myself. I'll be able to block this season 
out as quick as possible and work very hard over the winter and be ready next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Langston (9-16) allowed four hits, struck out six and walked one in earning the 
fourth victory in his last five decisions and his first shutout since Sept. 17, 
1989, when he was with the Montreal Expos and defeated the New York Mets, 1-0. 
The shutout, achieved on 102 pitches in 2 hours 19 minutes, was also his first 
in the league since April 8, 1989, when he was with Seattle and beat the 
Angels, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"That was perfect. Just great," Manager Doug Rader said. "He changed speeds 
well and had a nice ratio of balls to strikes. . . . I think he's finally 
starting to feel better about everything, and that's great. He's persevered and 
worked his tail end off, and I'm very happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
Rader had much to be happy about. The Angels scored twice in the first inning 
off starter Kevin Tapani (11-7), who left after three innings to protect a 
strained rib-cage muscle that had prevented him from pitching since Aug. 13. 
They scored again in the fourth on Jack Howell's run-scoring single off Roy 
Smith. They pulled away in the fifth on Johnny Ray's double-play grounder and 
Dave Winfield's two-run home run to center, the 373rd home run of his career, 
and made it a romp in the ninth when Kirby Puckett misplayed Luis Polonia's 
single for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis ended a one-for-27 slump with three hits and an RBI, but in the 
night's lone negative note, he aggravated the sore back that sidelined him for 
five games last week and his status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for all the times we didn't score for (Langston). Now we're even," 
Winfield joked. "We're just playing loose, getting hits and playing good ball. 
Home cooking, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who was three for four Monday and two for four Tuesday, credited his 
resurgence to adjustments he has made at the urging of hitting instructor Deron 
Johnson. He also credited, as he called it, "that announcement July 30," 
referring to Commissioner Fay Vincent's sanctions against former New York 
Yankee general partner George Steinbrenner. Before that announcement, Winfield 
was hitting .231 with 37 RBIs. In 34 games since then, he's hitting .320 (40 
for 125) for an overall average of .259, with 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I got an emotional boost at that point," Winfield said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is getting an emotional boost from his strong finish, although he 
won't permit himself to think about how different the season might have been 
for him and the Angels if he had pitched this well. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened and I'm disappointed with the way it's turned out, but I just look 
forward. I can't do anything about what happened in the past," he said. "The 
flustrating part is we know we're such a better team than the way we've 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A decision on Manager Doug Rader, whose contract expires after this season, is 
unlikely before Friday. General Manager Mike Port had said he would confer with 
Rader this week to discuss plans for next season, but Port is attending owners' 
meetings in Pittsburgh and won't return until late Thursday. No meeting between 
the two has been set, and Rader declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette was miffed to see his name omitted from the groups of hitters 
for batting practice Tuesday, although he was told it was inadvertent. "They 
don't even know I'm here," he said. . . . Kirk McCaskill plans to complete the 
season rather than move up his elbow surgery, which is scheduled for the 
off-season. "It's important for me to finish because I've been hurt two of the 
last three years and it wouldn't be very good for my career to make it three 
out of four," said McCaskill, who will have bone spurs removed from his right 
elbow. "Plus, I'm still able to pitch. (Continuing) isn't threatening my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill was reinstated off the disabled list although his sprained left 
wrist is too sore for him to hit. He was available as a defensive replacement. 
. . . Max Venable sprained his right ankle in a fall down stairs at home 
Tuesday and was unavailable. . . . Devon White has had more than 100 strikeouts 
for the third time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Quad Cities farm club won the Class-A Midwest League title, but 
Boise lost in the Class-A Northwest League finals to Spokane, which is owned by 
the family of Angel broadcaster Ken Brett. The Angels' triple-A Edmonton club 
has lost the first two games of the best-of-five Pacific Coast League 
championship series with the Dodgers' Albuquerque club. . . . Larry Casian, who 
attended Lakewood High School and Cal State Fullerton, will make his first 
major league start tonight for Minnesota.
