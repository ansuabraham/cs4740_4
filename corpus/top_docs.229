<LEADPARA>  It was the Montreal Olympics of 1976, in which the East German women's team
won 10 of 13 possible gold medals, that knocked the United States off its
throne as the world's supreme swimming power.;    But the '92 Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, may see the United States restored to its former place atop
the swim hierarchy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The U.S. women won their first world championship since 1978 last January,
and the U.S. men made the meet in Australia their sixth straight title.;    "I
think you can read quite a bit into that," said Stanford swimming coach
Richard Quick, who coached the U.S. Olympic team three years ago in Seoul,
South Korea.;    Quick said the world championships were "the major focus of
the year for our premier athletes, and they were against the best athletes in
the world. I think that we're in pretty good position" for Barcelona.;    On
the brink of greatness?;  Part of the story in Australia were world records
set by Mike Barrowman (200-meter breaststroke) and Melvin Stewart (200
butterfly). Part was the U.S. women's performance in recovering from a
disqualification in the 800 freestyle relay, in which they finished first, to
still top the medal and points standings.;    And part was the decline of a
reunited Germany, which suffered rather than gained from the change.;   
Although there are doubters -- notably '84 Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines,
now a television commentator -- that the world championships and this week's
strong performances at the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals are indicative of
Olympic success, many coaches such as Quick see the United States at the brink
of greatness.;    'You just don't know'; "A 16-, 17-year-old girl who set the
world on fire in January of '91 could be over the hill by the time March (date
of the Olympic trials) rolls around in '92," Gaines said. "You just don't
know. Look at Anita Nall. Who the heck is she? She came out of nowhere.";   
Actually Nall, 14, came out of Towson, Md., and Thursday at the Spring
Nationals, she twice lowered the U.S. record in 200 breaststroke to the
second-fastest time in the world. The last U.S. woman to hold the 200
breaststroke world record was Catherine Ball in 1968.;    Nall wasn't even on
the U.S. team at the world championships. That team was led by Janet Evans,
who won two gold medals and one silver.;    The U.S. man-from-nowhere this
week is Joe Hudepohl, 17, of Cincinnati, whose 100 freestyle was the
eighth-fastest in U.S. history, though only good enough for third place. He
wasn't at the world championships, either.;    U.S. men hold world records in
six of 11 individual Olympic events: Tom Jager (50 freestyle), Matt Biondi
(100 freestyle), Dave Berkoff (100 backstroke), Barrowman (200 breaststroke),
Pablo Morales (100 butterfly) and Stewart (200 butterfly). Only Morales is not
longer competing.;    After Evans, who holds three world records (400, 800 and
1,500 freestyle), the only ones by an active U.S. woman, the top U.S. women at
the world championships were Nicole Haislett, who won the 100 freestyle in
national-record time, and Summer Sanders, winner of the 200 butterfly.;    The
U.S. women topped the medals table 12-9 over Germany, the gold medal count 6-4
over China, and team scoring 395-374 over Germany.;    "I think a lot of
(Germany's decline) is the fact they were such rivals before (reunification),"
Gaines said. "It's going to take them a long time to jell as a team.;    "Then
you've got to remember East Germany doesn't have the drugs behind them that
they used to, which was quite obvious at the worlds.";    A German magazine
recently documented East Germany's extensive illegal drug program.;    U.S.
Swimming, the sport's national governing body, has reoriented its entire
training program toward producing gold medals at Barcelona, including changing
the Spring Nationals from the usual 25-yard short course to an international
50-meter course.;    That has upset some coaches and meet directors who
believe it will hurt national age-group development programs and take
big-name, ticket-selling swimmers away from summer meets.;    "I disagree,"
Quick said. "I think the focus of United States Swimming needs to be the
Olympic Games for elite-level athletes. Success at the Olympic Games will do
more for age-group swimming than anything I can think of."  </TEXT>

WHARTON BREAKS U.S. RECORD IN 400 MEDLEY 
</P>

<P>
David Wharton, competing in his home pool, set the first record of the U.S. 
Swimming Long Course National Championships Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton lowered his American record in the men's 400-meter individual medley to 
4 minutes 15.93 seconds in the University of Southern California pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan star is competing at this meet in the name of Team Foxcatcher, his 
club team back home in Pennsylvania. But he will be back at USC as a junior in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Namesnik pushed Wharton to the record, staying with Wharton through the 
fastest butterfly leg Wharton has ever recorded. Namesnik took the lead on the 
backstroke leg, stayed close through the breaststroke and pushed Wharton to his 
fastest freestyle leg ever. 
</P>
<P>
And that's pretty fast, considering Wharton once held the world record in the 
400 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton said that his first priority was to win the event and secure a berth on 
the Pan Pacific team that will be competing in Tokyo next month. "I was kind of 
nervous because I hadn't made the team yet," Wharton said. "Getting the record 
was an added bonus I'll certainly take. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt smooth tonight . . . Coming home I felt really strong." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton won the silver medal in this event in the 1988 Olympic Games, finishing 
behind Tamas Darnyi of Hungary. Darnyi set the world record of 4:14.75. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will be taking special notice of Darnyi's time in the upcoming 
European Championships in Bonn, Wharton smiled. "Of course," he said. "What 
he's done isn't out of my ballpark yet. . . . My objective will be to go faster 
in Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton holds the American records in both the 200-yard and the 400-yard 
individual medleys and has been voted National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
swimmer of the year the last two years. He said that with the experience he has 
had in international swimming in the last few years, he is starting to feel 
more confident in that arena, too. 
</P>
<P>
He will be swimming the 200-meter individual medley here Friday night. "I'll be 
a lot more relaxed and confident for the 200, now that I've made the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans of the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team won her second national title 
of the meet, in the 400-meter freestyle. But her 4:06.73 was no threat to the 
world record -- 4:03.85 -- that she set in winning the gold medal in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Heike Friedrich of East Germany chased her in Seoul. And no one chased her 
Wednesday. She is going to have to get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
Olympians Betsy Mitchell and Dan Veatch both came out of retirement to win 
backstroke titles Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell won the women's 100-meter backstroke in 1:02.37, and Veatch won the 
men's 200-meter backstroke in 2:02.09. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's performance was especially impressive considering that her time, 
after only a few weeks of training, beat the 1:02.53 she swam here in '84 to 
win the Olympic silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell at one time held world records in both the 100- and 200-meter 
backstrokes and still holds the record in the 200. She was about as burned out 
as a swimmer can get when she scratched from the 200 during the U.S. Olympic 
trials last summer in her own University of Texas pool and then, after 
finishing fourth in the 100 in Seoul, scratched from the medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that would come up," Mitchell said. "I thought that would 
probably look pretty bad. I wasn't making a statement or anything with that 
scratch. I just felt like I wasn't going to go faster than Beth (Barr) was 
going to go. She was going faster at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the end of a really long rope . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really horrible being at the Olympics, but things were really 
different for me once I was a world record-holder. To tell you the truth, it 
was probably me assuming that people were putting the pressure on me. . . . 
Tonight I had fun swimming for the first time in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, 23, had been coaching at her alma mater, the Mercersburg Academy in 
Pennsylvania, when she decided in early July that she wanted to swim again. She 
drove to Stanford in her jeep to work out with her former college coach, 
Richard Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Lang of Club Wolverine, a member of the 1988 Olympic team as a relay 
swimmer, won the 100-meter freestyle in 50.17. Nichole Haislett won the women's 
100-meter freestyle in 56.15. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The last time Carrie Steinseifer competed in a championship final in the USC 
pool, she finished in a tie with Nancy Hogshead to win the 1984 Olympic gold 
medal in the 100-meter freestyle. Steinseifer finished in a tie for sixth place 
with Janel Jorgensen Wednesday. . . . Tom Jager tuned up for his 50-meter swim 
against Matt Biondi on Friday by swimming the 100-meter freestyle Wednesday. He 
finished third in 50.4, earning a spot on the Pan Pacific team. The top four 
finishers in the 100-meter freestyle make it in order to fill the 400-meter 
freestyle relay. . . . Longhorn Aquatics led the team competition after the 
third day, leading also in both the men's competition and the women's 
competition.

   Big Splash at Ooey-Pooey

   Indianapolis -- Perhaps the best measure of the strength
of the U.S. Olympic swimming team that was selected by trial
of water here last week was a quip that Eddie Reese, who will
coach the men's team at Barcelona next July, made Friday
morning, after his roster was all but filled. Reese knew he
would have in his charge no fewer than six reigning world
record holders, yet he was able to say, almost
straight-facedly, that he'd "offered Mark Schubert (the
women's team coach) money if he'd switch jobs with me."
   Added Reese, eyes atwinkle: "Most of the talk here has
been about the women, and how tough they look. And, hey, I
agree. I'd have to think hard before I'd put my boys against
them head-to-head."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the talk was about the women because a couple of
them did their world-record busting at the Phillips 66
National Swimming Championships on the campus of Indiana
University-Purdue University-Indianapolis (IUPUI), which
natives of the Hoosier metropolis shorten to "Ooey-Pooey."
The meet doubled as the Olympic Trials, with the top two
finishers in each event qualifying.
   Last Sunday, the event's first day, Jenny Thompson, 19, a
blue-eyed blonde from Stanford U. via Dover, N.H., churned
the 100-meter freestyle in the unprecedented :54.48. The next
day Anita Nall, a stuffed-owl-loving, 15-year-old wunderkind
from Towson, Md., took the 200-meter breaststroke, in a
record 2:25.92. Before the waves died down on Friday night,
two more American women's records fell and two others were
nudged severely.
   But this is not to say Our Boys did poorly. Charmin'
Melvin Stewart, a voluble Tennessean, on Thursday night swam
the 200-meter butterfly in 1:55.72, just .03-second above his
own world mark, and a couple hours later Jeff Rouse, a
bespectacled Stanfordian, missed his 100-meter backstroke
record by .14-second, at :54.07.
   And in the highlight of a memorable evening-indeed, maybe
of the whole meet-Matt Biondi, the giant (6-foot-7) hero of
the 1988 Olympics in Seoul (he won seven medals, five of them
gold), edged world-record-holder Tom Jager by .05-second in
the 50-meter freestyle final, with his time of :22.12 pacing
the fastest eight-man field in the history of the event.
   "Our goal in Barcelona?" Reese would echo. "To win all the
medals, of course. Although we probably won't do it."
   Chances look good, though, that U.S. swimmers will do
better at Barcelona than they did at Seoul, where their
18-medal haul was this country's lowest in 28 years. The rosy
outlook stems partly from the demise of East Germany, which
dominated the women's side of the sport in the 1976, '80 and
'88 Games.
   When the Berlin Wall came down, so did the wall of silence
that surrounded steroid use by East German athletes, and the
fact that Thompson and Nall broke records formerly held by
East Germans was cause for some breast-beating here. "It's
good to see that drug-enhanced records have been broken by
our girls, swimming clean," said Dennis Pursley, national
team director for U.S. Swimming, the sport's domestic
governing body. When pressed, Pursley admitted that drugs
still may be present in the sport. "Techniques to cheat
remain ahead of techniques to test," he allowed. But he
added, "I know our people, and know they'd never use them."
   While Pursley didn't mention it, one American woman,
sprinter Angel Myers, tested positive for steroids after
qualifying for the 1988 Olympic team, and was barred from the
Games. Myers has maintained she never used the drugs. Now 24
years old, married and last-named Martino, she's back in the
sport after serving a suspension. She qualified in the
50-meter free-style and 400-meter free-style relay, but said
that restoring her reputation was not her motive. "I don't
think about that (the 1988 incident)," she said quietly.
"Maybe I block it out."
   U.S. swimmers hope they'll have a couple of other things
going for them. One will be the extra training that team
members can glean from having the Trials in early March,
nearly five months before the Games. The '88 Trials were just
six weeks before the Seoul fest, and it turned out that some
swimmers couldn't hold their competitive peaks that long. But
it should be recalled that the '88 format seemed like a good
idea at the time.
   Probably more important will be the results of the
increased financial help available to top U.S. Olympic
hopefuls over the last quadrennium; whatever other adjectives
might apply to swimmers, "poor" no longer is one of them.
Last year, 1988 triple-gold-medal winner Janet Evans,
breaststroke world-record holder Mike Barrowman and Biondi
each collected more than $50,000 in aid, and 17 other
swimmers got $20,000 or more. The upshot is a 1992 men's team
that averages 23 years old, and a women's crew that averages
20, both about two years above '88.
   "I'm here because I love the sport . . . and can afford to
keep pursuing it," affirmed Biondi, 26, who qualified for the
50and 100-meter freestyles and the 400-meter freestyle relay.
   The 20-year-old Evans will be back, too, having won the
400- and 800-meter freestyles that she captured at Seoul, but
having failed to qualify in the 400-meter individual medley,
which she also won in '88. Along with Thompson and Nall, much
of the women's spotlight fell on Summer Sanders, a
19-year-old Californian. She qualified impressively in four
individual events and earned other accolades as well.
   "This is not only our best women's team ever, but also the
best looking," declared Stewart. "I'd be willing to grovel
for a date with Summer."
   "Melvin?" responded the dark-haired Sanders when informed
of the above. "He hardly talks to any of the girls."
   Swimmingwise, experience was a stronger theme among the
men. Qualifiers included 27-year-old Pablo Morales, whose
1984 world record in the 100-meter butterfly still stands but
who failed to qualify for the '88 team, and David Berkoff,
25, a silver medalist in the 100-meter backstroke at Seoul
who disgustedly quit the sport for a time after the
underwater technique he'd pioneered was banned.
   But they also include Joe Hudepohl, an 18-year-old
Cincinnati high schooler, who won the 200-meter free-style
and later showed there was something else to be said for
youth. Did the "pressure" make the Trials a trial, he was
asked. "Not really," he responded. "Our high school meets are
like this."

BARROWMAN RECORD BRINGS WORLD-CLASS STATURE TO OPENING DAY

<P>
Hoping for at least one world record Friday to give Goodwill Games II 
credibility as a world-class athletic competition on its opening day, 
organizers were rewarded for their blood, sweat and deficit-spending with 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Because all three records came in the same race at the King County Aquatics 
Center, the impact was somewhat limited. But it was one great race. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman, a University of Michigan senior from Potomac, Md., won the 
200-meter breaststroke in 2:11.53, bettering the previous record he set last 
August in Tokyo by a staggering 1.36 seconds. No other swimmer had improved the 
record in the event by more than that since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Although they did not challenge Barrowman, Kirk Stackle, a recent University of 
Texas graduate from Penasquitos, Calif., and Sergio Lopez, a Spaniard who 
competes for American University in Washington, also broke the old record of 
2:12.89. They tied for second place in 2:12.24. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman, 21, said that he was surprised by his time but not by the fact that 
the race produced a world record. He trains with Lopez in Maryland under 
Hungarian Coach Jozsef Nagy and knew from recent workouts that they both were 
ready for a fast swim. Lopez's time earned a European record, a first for a 
Spanish swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend and I have trained a lot harder than we did last summer," Barrowman 
said. "This is the first time I ever came into a competition not being nervous, 
completely relaxed. Something inside said I knew I was going to swim well and 
don't worry about it. That's very unusual for me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am very surprised by the time. If somebody had asked me before the race, 
I would have said that we might swim 2:12.88. I would have been happy with 
anything under 2:12. But 2:11.53 is not something I thought was a reality. It 
was more like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a record to be set on the opening day of the 17-day, 21-sport 
Goodwill Games, organizers anticipated it most likely would come in swimming's 
first event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the race's co-favorites, Tom Jager and Matt Biondi, have 
broken the record in the event eight times since 1985, no one who values his 
money would have bet against it. 
</P>
<P>
In 19 meetings at either 50 meters or 50 yards since 1984, Jager, formerly of 
UCLA and now of Tijeras, N.M., had won 13 before Friday. But Biondi, who 
graduated from Cal and now lives in Castro Valley, Calif., won the big one at 
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. He also won six other medals, five golds. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd of 2,472 were still filing into the new arena between 
Seattle and Tacoma when Jager and Biondi were scheduled to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for some of the late arrivals, there were two false-starts by 
anxious rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their only chance," Biondi said, dismissing East Germany's Nils 
Rudolph's beating both him and Jager this month in Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Jager had won the last four meetings with Biondi and led in this 
one for about 25 meters. But Biondi overtook him and then held off a late surge 
about 10 meters from the finish to win in 22.10 seconds. Jager was second in 
22.31, well off his world record of 21.81. Rudolph was fourth in 22.61. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who has complained because swimmers are not being paid for competing 
here while athletes in some other sports are receiving thousands of dollars, 
valued the victory as an advertisement for the "Dash for Cash" match races that 
he and Jager are staging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for me and for the sport of swimming that I'm seen as a viable 
contender in the 50," he said. "Tom's been beating me up pretty bad. It's good 
for me and for the sport to know that I can beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Interrupted Jager, "It was all planned." 
</P>
<P>
In the other featured event, the women's 800-meter freestyle, Janet Evans' only 
problem came about 10 meters into the race, when she lost her goggles. She won 
in 8:28.47, and second place Anke Moehring of East Germany swam 8:33.44. 
</P>
<P>
A closer race was expected. Evans, the gold medalist in Seoul, was joined by 
silver medalist Astrid Strauss of East Germany and bronze medalist Julie 
McDonald of Australia. McDonald was fourth and Strauss fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the field might have been faster," said Evans, a Stanford sophomore 
from Placentia. "I kind of hoped it would be more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi and Evans were stars of the U.S. swimming team in Seoul, but Barrowman 
was one of its few disappointments. After setting an American record in the 200 
breaststroke at the U.S. trials in Austin, Tex., he was favored to win at the 
Olympics. But he finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the pain has been eased by the three world records he has set since 
then in the event. But he has not forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it continues to haunt me," he said. "If it stops, that means it's time 
to stop swimming. Setting records helps, but I hope it still burns down there."

Tom Jager, a silver medalist in the Seoul Olympics, said he wants to prove that 
older swimmers can compete in a sport dominated by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, 24, who works as an aquatics director in Albuquerque, N.M., showed 
Saturday that he is fast enough to win major competitions with a victory in the 
50-meter freestyle during the third day of the International Swim Meet of 
Champions at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who was edged by Matt Biondi for the gold medal in the 1988 Olympic 50, 
was clocked in 23.74 seconds. Brian Kurza of UCLA finished second in 24.15 and 
Brian Jacobson, 15, of the Bellflower Aquatic Club was third in 24.35. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have scrambled a bit much in my race, and that might have slowed me down 
a bit," said Jager, whose 23.60 was the top qualifying time in Saturday 
morning's preliminaries. Jager, who wants to break Biondi's world record of 
22.14 set during the Seoul Games, said he decided to continue competing to 
serve as a role model for younger competitors as well as help find ways for 
athletes to stay in the sport after they complete their college careers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot still needs to be done in the sport," Jager said. "United States 
Swimming (the sport's governing body in the United States) needs to take better 
care of our athletes than they are doing now so we can continue to train and 
stay in the sport after they complete college." 
</P>
<P>
Still a teen-ager, Janet Evans of Placentia need only worry about winning, 
which she did twice Saturday. Evans, the world-record holder in the 400-meter 
freestyle, won that event in 4:13.55. 
</P>
<P>
France's Laurence Bensimon finished second in 4:19.65 and Francie O'Leary of 
the Click Tucson Swim Club was third in 4:19.65. 
</P>
<P>
Evans held off Mission Viejo High School senior Suzi Burt to win the 200 
backstroke in 2:18.53. Burt, who stayed with Evans during the first half of the 
race, ns was second in 2:22.27, and Natalie Norberg of Industry Hills was third 
in 2:23.51. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," said Evans, who won the 400-meter individual medley but 
finished fourth in the 200 butterfly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat scored his third 
victory of the meet by edging 1988 U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat, who battled with Jorgensen for the lead for most of the race, had a 
strong last 100 meters to win. Wojdat was timed in 3:55.09, Jorgensen 3:56.63. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat's fellow Pole and Mission Viejo Nadadore swim club teammate Mariusz 
Podkoscielny was third in 3:57.77, and Jorgensen's younger brother, Lars, was 
fourth in 4:00.80.

A BUSY EVANS TO COMPETE IN MEET BEGINNING TODAY 
</P>

<P>
Janet Evans, who took very little time off after the Olympics in Seoul last 
September before getting back into her incredible training regimen, somehow 
managed to train, handle a crush of requests for appearances, parades and award 
dinners and still compete for Placentia's El Dorado High School and her 
Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team, knocking off distance swim records all along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
She's tough over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Today, just one day after her high school graduation ceremonies, Evans is 
opening her long-course season in the Swim Meet of Champions at Mission Viejo. 
Evans will swim the 800 at 4 p.m. and will compete every day in the meet that 
continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also plans to swim the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, 
200-meter breaststroke, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, 
400-meter individual medley and the 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Finals start at 5 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will be attending Stanford in the fall and swimming there under the 
direction of Richard Quick, former Olympic coach and former women's coach at 
the University of Texas, has been working with Don Wagner, the new coach of her 
Fullerton Aquatics team. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a former assistant at the University of Arizona, replaced Bud 
McAllister, who coached Evans to three Olympic gold medals before moving on to 
a club in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Evans broke the 1,650-yard freestyle record that had been set by 
Olympian Tiffany Cohen in 1983. She lowered it from 15 minutes 46.54 seconds to 
15:44.98. And in March, at the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals 
in Chapel Hill, N.C., she broke Cohen's American record in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. She lowered that record from 9:28.32 to 9:25.49. 
</P>
<P>
It may take her a meet or two to get up to speed in this long-course season, 
but Evans is planning to compete in all the major meets. She is one of the 
stars that U.S. Swimming is planning to use both in Tokyo, at the Pan Pacific 
meet, and in Atlanta, against the Soviets, just days later. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it . . . 
</P>
<P>
The annual meet at Mission Viejo has recently acquired Chrysler as a sponsor, 
which could mean that it will again be able to pay travel expenses for the top 
caliber swimmers who used to be attracted to the meet when it was sponsored by 
Seventeen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the swimmers on the West Coast are competing either in the Santa Clara 
meet July 7-9 or in the Los Angeles Invitational July 13-16. East Coast 
swimmers will be competing in the Charlotte Ultra Swim Invitational June 22-25. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Invitational, which will be held at USC, has drawn not only 
Evans, but also Olympian Sylvia Poll of Costa Rica. USC Olympians Dave Wharton 
and Dan Jorgensen are also scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Invitational will be televised by TBS. 
</P>
<P>
All of the early summer meets are tuneups for the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming 
Long Course National Championships, which also will be held at USC, July 
31-Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi is not ready to say when he plans to race again, but there is 
little doubt that he will. Somehow, somewhere and no doubt for some profit, 
Biondi will sprint against his old nemesis, Tom Jager. 
</P>
<P>
If Biondi chooses to skip the long-course national meet and, therefore, the Pan 
Pacific meet, it is likely that he will swim a match race with Jager -- a 
prospect that no doubt would attract network television. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi quit the national water polo team last week just before reporting to the 
Bahamas for the filming of a CBS project in which, of course, he swims with the 
dolphins he has grown to love. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi has not raced since his final Olympic event last September. He swam the 
butterfly leg for the 400-meter medley relay that won gold, and then announced 
that he would be putting all of his athletic efforts into making the national 
water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the water polo team has kept him in shape, and he would certainly 
be of value to the U.S. team -- especially on the relays -- if he did decide to 
qualify for the Pan Pacific meet. As Jeff Dimond of U.S. Swimming put it: "If 
Matt decides to swim again, we'll be turning cartwheels." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Hines will defend her title as women's champion in the United States Ten 
Mile Swim in this year's ocean race along a course that runs between Huntington 
Beach and Seal Beach. Hines is using the race to gain attention for her quest 
to make an endurance swim an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to see a 10-mile swim become a demonstration event in 1992 and a 
medal event by 1996. According to Hines, U.S. Swimming and its masters program 
have submitted the event for Olympic consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Endurance swimming deserves Olympic status," she says. "It is an international 
sport, it demands the highest levels of skill and training, and it is 
incredibly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The United States sent a team of swimmers to the Soviet Union for a meet at 
Tallinn June 2-4 and the young women fared surprisingly well. They won nine 
gold medals, seven silver and one bronze in the 16 events, including an upset 
gold in the 400-meter medley relay. Pam Minthorn, 18, of Gaithersburg, Md., who 
swims for Curl-Burke Swim Club, won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:02.32, the 
100-meter butterfly in 1:01.5, and the 200-meter butterfly in 2:13.18. Summer 
Sanders, 16, of Roseville, who swims for the California Capital Aquatics, won 
both individual medleys. . . . Don Gambril has been named coach of the men's 
team and Dick Shoulberg has been named coach of the women's team for the Pan 
Pacific Games, the Alamo Cup and the World Cup meet to be held in Australia in 
January.

Freshman Jeff Rouse of Stanford won the 200-yard backstroke as Olympic silver 
medalist David Berkoff of Harvard ended his competitive career by placing 
second Saturday in the men's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Swimming and 
Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, helped by Shaun Jordan's victory in the 100 freestyle, a first in the 
400-freestyle relay and a second by defending champion Kirk Stackle in the 200 
breaststroke, won the team title for the second consecutive year. The Longhorns 
finished with 475 points. Stanford, which had its string of three consecutive 
titles snapped last year, was second at 396. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan was third with 315, UCLA fourth with 313.5 and USC fifth with 304. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Reese of Texas was selected coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
USC's David Wharton, who swept the two medley events earlier in the meet, 
received the swimmer of the year award for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, the runner-up to Berkoff when he set an American record in the 100 
backstroke Friday, won in 1:44.87 seconds. Berkoff, who set a world record in 
the preliminaries of the 100-meter backstroke at the Seoul Olympics and won the 
silver medal, finished at 1:45.88. 
</P>
<P>
"The 200 isn't his race," Rouse said. "He's better in the 100, but it does make 
me feel good to beat a world record-holder. I believe I'm a little better at 
the 200 than David Berkoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a sense of where he was, but I never really looked at him." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse made an error on his final turn. "I jammed the wall," he said. "I was 
expected to take another stroke and all of a sudden, the wall was there. . . . 
I misjudged it. That's happened to me before, but it was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a member of the U.S. Olympic team last year, took the 100 freestyle in 
42.98. USC's Erik Ran of the Netherlands, who was disqualified in two races 
during the meet, was second in 43.08. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman of Michigan, who set an American record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke at the Olympic trials last year and took fourth at Seoul, won the 
200 breaststroke in 1:55.72 with Stackle, who won the 100 breaststroke Friday, 
second at 1:57.01. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona freshman Mariusz Podkoscielny, a Polish Olympian last year, won the 
NCAA title and was on pace to set a U.S. Open and NCAA mark in the 1,650 
freestyle until the final 50 yards. His winning time of 14:38.09 was 17 seconds 
faster than the runner-up in his heat and just missed the record of 14:37.87 
set by Stanford's Jeff Kostoff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
John Witchel of Stanford, who swam his heat earlier, placed second in 14:49.69. 
California's Sean Killion, who also raced in an earlier heat, was third in 
14:52.31. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Melvin Stewart, a freshman who was fifth in the 200-meter butterfly 
at Seoul, won the 200 butterfly in a race in which the top three swimmers 
finished within 0.7 of a second of each other. Stewart finished in 1:44.30. 
Bart Pippenger of Nevada Las Vegas was next in 1:44.60, and Wharton was third 
in 1:44.98. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Methodist's Scott Donnie won the 10-meter platform diving with 757.45 
points. Pat Evans of Cincinnati, who won the three-meter event Friday and 
placed second on the one-meter Thursday, was second at 708.80 and was voted 
diver of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hobie Billingsley, retiring after 31 years at Indiana, tied Cincinnati's 
Charlie Kasuto for diving coach of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
There were several surprises in the preliminaries. USC's Dan Jorgensen, the 
defending champion in the 1,650 freestyle, had a time of 15:09.89 and placed 
14th. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Brent Lang, who won the 50 freestyle on Thursday, was disqualified 
for a false start when he tried to defend the 100 free championship. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana diver Mark Lenzi, who won the one meter and finished second at three 
meters, withdrew after injuring his wrist on his third dive off the 10-meter 
platform in the preliminaries. Lenzi attempted one more dive before 
withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
The injury was not expected to keep Lenzi out of the indoor national 
championships coming up later this month.

   It's quiz time again. 
How many of you can name three famous sporting Blanchards? 

   Of course, there's "Doc" -- real first name Felix -- who won the 1945 Heisman Trophy playing fullback for the U. of Army football team. 
And Johnny, who played catcher and outfield on a lot of the New York Yankees' championship baseball teams of the 1950s and '60s. 
But how about the third? 

   As of last week, you'd have to include Mary Ellen Blanchard, Doc's 16-year-old granddaughter. 
She showed up at the Phillips 66/U.S. 
Swimming Long Course Championships here and came away with a full medal packet: A gold for winning the women's 200-meter breaststroke, a silver for taking second in the 100, and a bronze for a third place in the 200-meter individual medley. 

   Freckled Mary Ellen, from Norcross, Ga., emerged not only bemedaled but also bedecked with praise from none less than Janet Evans, the U.S.'s three-golds aquatic queen of the 1988 Olympics at Seoul. 
Still giggly despite having achieved the advanced age of 17, Evans won four races here, three of them by furlongs instead of body lengths, but edged Blanchard and second-place Summer Sanders, also 16, by only one second and change in the 200 IM. 

   "That was a race]" Evans enthused after the win. 
"It was neat having someone near me at the finish." 
She said she entered the 200, her shortest event ever in a national meet, because she knew that she'd get heat from Blanchard and Sanders. 
She added: "Usually, the kids who do well the year after an Olympics hang around for the next three years. 
That definitely should include Mary Ellen and Summer." 

   That this is, indeed, the first (and usually quietest) year of the four-year Olympic cycle that governs swimming and other sports that come to popular life only quadrennially was apparent from a glance at the meet's surrounding. 
Its site was the 50-meter outdoor pool on the campus of the University of Southern California, where up to 14,000 people crowded high-rise bleachers for the swimming segment of the L.A. Olympics of 1984. 
Now the bleachers are gone, and despite four California-perfect days, the pool's permanent seating of about 2,000 was mostly more than adequate to accommodate the usual complement of parents and teachers. 

   Sad to say, a goodly portion of the throng that showed up on Friday, the final day, went home feeling cheated. 
The day's -- and perhaps meet's -- main event was to be a rematch in the men's 50- meter freestyle between Matt Biondi, the 1988 Olympic titlist and world's record holder, and Tom Jager, the runnerup at Seoul and the ex-record holder. 
But one false start disqualified Jager and another removed Todd Pace, the fourth-fastest qualifier, cutting the field to six. 
And when the race finally did get off, the 6-foot-7 Biondi started a whit slowly, maybe enough to have cost him another mark. 
His winner's time of 22.36 seconds was .22-second over his standard, and he later remarked that his first two starts were better. 

   It's worth noting that the U.S. rule on false starts differs from the international one, which gives fields two misfires before heads are lopped. 
It's also worth noting that a rules issue detracted from another event, the backstroke. 
David Berkoff, a Harvard student, revolutionized that stroke's 100-meter race, and set a world's record last year, by swimming the first 30 or so yards underwater. 
But after the Olympics, the sport's killjoy world governing body, FINA, decreed that, henceforth, backstrokers must surface by the 10-meter mark. 

   The U.S. retains the crowd-pleasing unlimited-underwater rule for domestic use, but used the FINA statute here because the Nationals were the qualifying race for a team that will compete in the international Pan Pacific meet in Tokyo later in the month. 
Still, the no-false-starts rule wasn't altered. 

   "If we went with FINA on the backstroke, why not on the starts, too?" asked Jager afterwards. 
He'd remonstrated with officials after he got the hook -- while fans chanted "Let him swim]" -- but later cooled off and called his disqualification "part of the game." 
No one, however, could answer his question about the rules hodgepodge. 

   As is typical of most post-Olympic-year meets, the swim nationals were contested by a mix of vets and newcomers, and the vets generally posted the best times. 
The stopwatch highlight was a new world's record of 2:12.90 in the men's 200-meter breaststroke by Mike Barrowman, a University of Michigan student who'd finished fourth in the event at Seoul. 
He did it in the Thursday morning prelims, and while his time in the afternoon finals was nearly two seconds higher (he said he got water in his goggles) it still earned him a first. 

   "My mother, father and girlfriend hated me this summer for spending so much time in the pool, but this makes it worthwhile," the slim Barrowman said of his mark. 

   Spending a lot of time in the pool is what swimming is all about. 
It seems like a drag, but some of the returning vets, including Biondi, a seven-medal winner at Seoul, admitted that life without laps wasn't what he thought it might be, so he ended a post-O Game retirement to swim again here. 
Evans, who has grown two inches (to 5-foot-6) since last year and soon will enter Stanford, said she still enjoys being wet even though she hasn't trained as intensively as she did in 1988. 

   But rest assured that the killer instinct of Evans, who plans to stick around through '92, is intact. 
Asked what she thinks about when she turns for home pool-lengths ahead of rivals, she said, "How to get farther ahead." 

   Mary Ellen Blanchard was one of a batch of other teen-aged winners among the women, but if genetics count she well might turn out best. 
Besides grandpa Doc, father Tony and brother Rhett play or played football and mom Barbara and sister Lee Anne are tennis aces. 
"In my family, it's compete or die," she smiles. 
At 5-foot-9 and 127 pounds she has the size of a pool champ, and the proper interests. 
Her hobbies? 
"Music, reading, doing laps."

THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT FOR STANFORD'S SANDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
While the anthropology professor explained that the expectation level is the 
primary difference between humans and monkeys, a few students skimmed The 
Stanford Daily. 
</P>
<P>
Others thumbed through the syllabus, making notations for a research paper that 
had just been assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, the professor made a declaration that caught the attention of 
Summer Sanders, the lanky blonde in the 15th row of the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings live in a world that doesn't exist," he said. "A world of worries 
and dreams that have not occurred yet. Monkeys live only in the present, not in 
the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
For Sanders, there is no better time than the present. If her freshman year at 
Stanford is anything like her freshman year -- which she calls the best year of 
her life -- at Oakmont High in Roseville, Calif., she has it made. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if she thinks ahead to this weekend's U.S. Open or the World Swimming 
Championships in January or the 1992 Olympic Games, she'll go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"You only have so much worrying in you," Sanders said. "I hate worrying and 
being nervous for races. I like to talk and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sanders can excuse the swimming world for wanting to press fast 
forward. Expectations are high since her triple gold-medal performance in the 
Goodwill Games last July. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' clocking of 2 minutes 9.46 seconds in the 200-meter butterfly was the 
second-fastest ever by an American and the fastest in the world in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Despite qualifying last in the 200 individual medley, she struck gold again in 
2:14.06, the fastest time by an American since Tracy Caulkins' effort in the 
1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
And in the meet's biggest upset, Sanders handed Janet Evans her first defeat 
since 1986, knocking an astonishing 8.68 seconds off her 400 individual medley 
best. Sanders' clocking of 4:39.22 is the fastest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sanders is 3.12 seconds shy of Petra Schneider's 1982 world record, 
Stanford Coach Richard Quick believes Sanders eventually will break it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no question in my mind," said Quick, who also serves as 
U.S. national team women's coach. "Summer Sanders has the potential in the 400 
individual medley to go under the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sanders despises that event, a sequence of 100 meters of butterfly, 
backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle that some coaches call the toughest race 
because of the stroke versatility and stamina it demands. "If I never swam 
another 400 IM in my life, I'd probably be the happiest person in the world," 
Sanders said. "It is the hardest thing ever." 
</P>
<P>
Like many medley swimmers, Sanders was an age-group breast-stroker. A pulled 
muscle prevented her from training in the breast-stroke for a few months and 
sparked her interest in and mastery of the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Her butterfly rivals the efficiency of Mary T. Meagher," Quick said of the 
world record-holder in the 100 and 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Sanders' second leg was a weak link. But her club coach, Mike 
Hastings of California Capital Aquatics, developed her into a national-caliber 
backstroker. 
</P>
<P>
The third leg, breaststroke, has always been a strength. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains for Sanders to improve is her freestyle, a segment that most 
medley swimmers don't struggle with because much of their training is in 
freestyle. Although Sanders' freestyle is above average, it doesn't compare to 
her other strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ability to stave off Evans, the world record-holder in three distance 
freestyle events, was a breakthrough. "(Rivals) always pass me," Sanders said. 
"I've been passed many times." 
</P>
<P>
The most painful of those occurred at the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials in Austin, 
Tex. Sanders led by a body length with 50 meters left when Mary Wayte and 
Whitney Hedgepeth passed her and became the two representatives the United 
States sent to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
At Oakmont High, Sanders' classmates staged a rally that cheered her up, 
despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about the rally," Sanders said, "because if I'd known about it, 
I wouldn't have shown up. I was kind of embarrassed. I started crying up there 
in front of the whole school. I felt (foolish). But it was nice. . . . I was 
real honored." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders yearns to be accepted, she wants the option of being 
unconventional. That is what binds her family in their own definition of 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' parents divorced when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what it was," Sanders said. "All I remember is that my friend's 
parents had just gotten divorced. Her parents were buying her all these toys so 
when my parents told me they were getting divorced I said, 'Yes. Toys! Woo!' I 
had no idea what a divorce was." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders found out soon enough that it meant moving from one parent's home to 
the other every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I would move from one house to another, I seriously probably 
couldn't talk for a day," she said. "I was so sad. I'd sit there and cry for 
about most of the day. You get so used to coming home and there's your dad and 
you do certain things with him, and then you all of a sudden move and your dad 
is not there. And me with my swimming, I didn't see him that much, you know. I 
maybe talked to him a couple times a week. We'd go out to dinner every once in 
a while and go to a movie, but it wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
It became more difficult at 15 when her older brother, Trevor, stopped making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of a bummer when I had to leave him," Sanders said. "But I like 
going to my mom's so I kept at it." 
</P>
<P>
That has been the key to Sanders' sunny disposition, maintaining warm 
relationships with her father, her mother, her brother and her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really close to all the parts of my family," Sanders said. "I think I want 
my kids to have the same family I do. God, they're so laid back. You know, it's 
not like you have to do this, otherwise you'll be a bad person. Like, if you 
want to, you can. It is totally up to us. When I think about church, it was up 
to us. My swimming was up to me. " 
</P>
<P>
Summer Sanders, nickname Scum, reveals nothing about swimming on the canvas of 
collegiate personality, her dorm room walls. 
</P>
<P>
They are plastered with Michael Jordan posters and she wears Air Jordans that 
Trevor gave her on graduation day, the ones she slept in that night. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' roommate didn't even know she was living with a world-class swimmer 
until one of Sanders' swimming friends told her. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is equally eager to conceal her academic prowess. She makes no mention 
of her U.S. Swimming Academic All-American status. Sanders is intimidated by 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I was real worried because people were using these huge 
words, and I'm into the simple kind of stuff," she said. "One day my friend Lea 
Loveless and I were walking down the hall when someone said something about 
mendicants. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'Lea, my vocabulary is not very good, what is mendicants?' and she 
said, 'Oh God, Summer, it is a singing group.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is not something she's going to worry about, however. Sanders tries not to 
look back or forward. 
</P>
<P>
Her faithful watch ever on her wrist, she simply follows her demanding academic 
and athletic schedule, including predawn swims while the rest of the campus 
sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea of a good time? Whatever is going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I could just sit here in my dorm room looking at my pictures," Sanders said. 
"I could listen to music. I could read this Homer book ('The Iliad') . . . oh, 
just kidding."

<LEADPARA>  It took three years to do it, but Angel Martino, who was disqualified from the
1988 Olympic team, is once again a national champion.;    Martino, of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., won the 50-meter freestyle in the U.S. Swimming Spring
Nationals on the final evening of the meet Sunday in 25.88 seconds.  </LEADPARA>

positive steroid test following the '88 Olympic trials, when she was unmarried
Angel Myers. Martino had led the first half of the 100 freestyle earlier this
week but faded to fifth. She was sixth in the 100 butterfly.;    After both
races, she said that lack of training and competition during and after her
16-month suspension had cost her endurance. But the 50, a no-turn dash from
one end of the King County Aquatics Center pool to the other, proved to be her
distance.;    "I'm getting there," said Martino, 23, one of the oldest
swimmers at the meet. "I feel old.";    She'll drop the 200 individual medley,
previously one of her best events, from her program because of her age, she
said. But she'll try to qualify for the '92 Olympics in the three races she
swam in this meet.;    Janet Evans won her fourth event of the meet with a
time of 16 minutes, 11.22 seconds in the 1,500 freestyle, the 10th-fastest
time ever. Evans holds four of the top 10 1,500 times, including the world
record at 15:52.10 set at the 1988 Olympic trials. She also earned sixth place
in the 200 backstroke and was the highest point-scorer of the meet, with 80.; 
  "I'm excited to get back to training hard," said Evans, who is leaving
Stanford to concentrate on the '92 Games. "I know what I want, I'm going to
work hard for it, and I'm willing to do that.";    No world records fell in
the meet despite it being the qualifier for three U.S. teams being sent to
international meets this summer: the Pan Pacific Championships in Edmonton,
Alberta; the Pan American Games in Havana; and the World University Games in
Sheffield, England.;    "I think if we hadn't just come from the NCAAs you
would have seen some more American records and world records," said men's 200
I.M. winner David Wharton.;    Nevertheless, several U.S. marks fell:;

EVANS WINS U.S. TITLE IN 400 IM; 
</P>
<P>
TWO OTHER TEENS -- BLANCHARD, KOLE -- ALSO VICTORIOUS

After breezing to another national title in the women's 400-meter individual 
medley Tuesday night in the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National 
Championships, 17-year-old Janet Evans said that she was starting to feel old. 
</P>
<P>
Not that she was aching in her bones or gasping for breath. But it's not the 
same as it was in the old days, when she swam in her first long course national 
meet at age 13. When she was a new kid and hung around with the other new kids, 
gawking at the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Now when she walks from the awards stand to the interview room, little girls 
follow along to peek in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's the star. 
</P>
<P>
The down side to stardom is that there is no one to push her. 
</P>
<P>
She had some competition when she won the gold medal in the 400 IM during the 
Olympic Games in Seoul, enough to push her to a U.S. record of 4 minutes 37.76 
seconds. Tuesday, she won in 4:39.36 with Michelle Griglione almost eight 
seconds behind her. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, her first of this meet, puts her on the U.S. team that will 
compete at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo and then in a dual meet against the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard racing against the clock," Evans said. "I like to have 
competition. But what can you do? . . . I want to go faster at Tokyo. But there 
probably won't be anyone there, either. I'll have to do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested that she might get some competition when she meets the 
Soviets in Atlanta, she brightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," she said. "There is a Soviet girl who has a really fast 400 IM. I 
hadn't thought about that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the excitement and the competition of the Olympic Games made 
everything else seem like a letdown, Evans answered with her trademark smile 
and shrug: "The Olympics only come around every four years, and there are a lot 
of other meets in between that." 
</P>
<P>
Two 16-year-olds won the other women's events Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Blanchard (granddaughter of 1945 Heisman Trophy winner Doc 
Blanchard) won the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:31.59, and Julie Kole 
(who had won the 1,500-meter freestyle Monday) won the women's 200-meter 
freestyle in 2:00.95. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Schroeder, 27, a swimmer who could tell Evans what it is to feel old on 
the deck, won the men's 100-meter breaststroke. Schroeder, who won a gold medal 
with the 400-meter medley relay team in Seoul, has left his job as an 
accountant with Price Waterhouse to become a carpenter. He prefers the physical 
work to the hours behind the desk. But his hours for weightlifting and training 
are still limited. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he continue to swim? 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to do it because I thrive on competition," Schroeder said. 
"Physically, I don't think I was ready to go 1:02.4, but, boy, I don't like to 
get beat, so I did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (the younger guys) like me hanging around, but I want to keep 
them honest. They'll pass me eventually, but they'll have to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gjertsen, 22, who won two gold medals on relay teams in Seoul, has 
completed a suspension for his limited involvement in the mask-napping caper in 
Korea, and is again competing for Longhorn Aquatics. Gjertsen beat fellow 
Olympian Melvin Stewart in the men's 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Wade King, who won the men's 100-meter butterfly, heard Evans saying that she 
felt old and commented: "How does she think I feel?" King is 22 and is just now 
starting to make his mark. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled with his national title and the prospect of competing for the 
U.S. in Tokyo. So far, the highlight of his career has been competing for the 
U.S. in the Pan Am Games in 1987 -- while Evans and company were competing at 
the Pan Pacific Games in Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
King, who swam for the University of South Carolina, explains that swimming 
there is not as "intense" as swimming in California or Texas or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he planned to retire soon, he said: "Not now. Placing the way I did, 
I'll get a lot more financial support. I'll definitely be able to stay in 
swimming another year." 
</P>
<P>
Wade's time (53.72 seconds) was better than the 54.58 recorded in the 
consolation final by 1988 Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty. Because he is 
from Suriname and is not a U.S. citizen, Nesty, a University of Florida 
swimmer, was not seeded into the final of this U.S. championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
Competition will continue here through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
This meet is the selection meet for the Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo Aug. 
17-20 and most of the swimmers will go directly from Tokyo to Atlanta for the 
Aug. 24-26 meet (the Alamo Cup) against the Soviet team. The Soviet swimmers 
will be coming from the European championships in Bonn, West Germany. . . . 
Mike Bottom, 33, who won the 1974 men's national title in the 100-meter 
butterfly with a time of 55.5 seconds and went on to a berth on the 1980 U.S. 
Olympic team, made the consolation final of the 100-meter butterfly Tuesday 
night swimming for the Walnut Creek Aquabears. He finished 15th in 55.44 -- a 
tick faster than his '74 time. . . . Olympian Dan Jorgensen of Blue Fin Swim 
Team (and USC) was fourth in the men's 200-meter freestyle.

UCLA WOMEN AIM FOR HIGH PAC-10 FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The seventh-ranked UCLA women's team is on a roll going into the Pacific 10 
Conference swimming meet today through Sunday at the East Los Angeles College 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins defeated USC two weeks ago, 86-54, and Coach Cyndi Gallagher is 
hoping for a top-three finish this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to equal last year's performance," she said. "We have four girls 
qualified (for the NCAA meet in March) and hope to get a lot more. We were 
third last year and will challenge (Arizona State) for that again." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and Cal, No. 4, will probably contend for 
the team championship. UCLA, Arizona State, and USC will battle for the next 
spots. Oregon dropped its swimming program in 1986 so only nine teams will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, finished in a sixth-place tie with 
Michigan at last year's NCAA meet. The Bruins have five All-Americans and 
several other swimmers who can score in championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
For the Trojans, the performance against the Bruins was encouraging, despite 
the defeat. Going into the meet, USC Coach Darrell Fick knew that winning would 
be difficult because USC was giving away so many points in diving. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has a much stronger diving program than USC, and because two diving events 
are included in dual meets, and scored like the swimming events, the Trojans 
were starting with a 14-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-ranked Trojans (9-6 and 0-5) have three All-Americans and several 
freshmen who have potential to score at the conference and NCAA meets. They 
finished fourth in the Pac-10 meet last year and 25th in the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is optimistic that USC will finish in the top five this weekend but will 
not be disappointed with a lower placing. Several of USC's top swimmers have 
qualified for the NCAA meet and they will not be shaving for the conference 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be aiming for third or fourth," Fick said. "Cal and Stanford are just 
too deep, but we'll be in with UCLA and Arizona State." 
</P>
<P>
Fick thinks the Trojans will improve on last year's NCAA performance, and 
expects his swimmers to finish in the top 10. The team was dealt a setback, 
however, when Australian distance swimmer Janelle Elford changed her mind about 
attending USC after competing in last month's Commonwealth Games. 
</P>
<P>
Elford, the last person to have beaten Stanford's Janet Evans in a distance 
freestyle event at a major meet, won a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 
Commonwealth games, and Fick was counting on her to help the Trojans in both 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
USC's men's team defeated UCLA on Saturday, 69-44, and finished the regular 
season unbeaten in 11 meets. The Trojans are ranked second in the nation going 
into the Pac-10 meet March 5-7 at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. UCLA, which is 
tied with Michigan for fourth, finished its regular season at 9-4 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was USC's fifth consecutive victory over UCLA. USC had two scorers out of a 
possible three in seven of the 11 individual events, including the 1,000- and 
200-yard freestyles, in which it placed first through fourth. 
</P>
<P>
After UCLA had swept Cal and Stanford two weeks ago, the Bruin-Trojan meet 
looked to be one of the top duals of the year. But the week after the sweep, 
UCLA had disciplinary problems and five swimmers were suspended for meets 
against Arizona State and Arizona. In addition, freshman backstroke ace Geoff 
Cronin missed those meets and the USC meet as well because of poor attendance 
at practice. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi and Tom Jager will meet again in 50-yard freestyle match races next 
month at Nevada Las Vegas and Iowa. They will swim March 2 at UNLV's Buchanan 
Natatorium for $4,500 in prizes, $2,500 going to the winner. That race will be 
held in conjunction with the Nevada Short Course championships. 
</P>
<P>
Meet director Dave Marsh, the coach of Las Vegas Gold swim team, has also lined 
up a 200-yard butterfly race between retirees Tracy Caulkins and Mary Meagher, 
and a 100-yard freestyle race between Rowdy Gaines and Australian Mark 
Stockwell. 
</P>
<P>
Caulkins won 48 national championships and Meagher is still the world 
record-holder in the 100-and 200-meter butterfly events, and the U.S. 
record-holder in each the 100- and 200-yard butterfly. Each won three gold 
medals at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The race between Gaines and Stockwell pits the 1984 Olympic gold medalist 
against the silver medalist for the first time since those games. In their last 
meeting, Stockwell charged that Gaines jumped the start and should have been 
disqualified. Videotapes showed that Gaines did not come to a full stop before 
the starter started the race but the result stood. 
</P>
<P>
On March 28, when they meet at Iowa, Biondi and Jager will be joined by Tom 
Williams, the 50-meter freestyle champion at the 1987 Pan-American Games. 
</P>
<P>
The race, which will be held in conjunction with the U. S. Swimming Junior 
Olympic championships at the Iowa field house, will have a prize of $5,000 for 
the winner. As an added incentive, any swimmer who beats 19 seconds will win a 
new car. Biondi holds the American record of 19.15 seconds. Jager and Williams 
have swum 19.24 and 19.64 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi beat Jager in the first match race in December at Long Beach.

Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Last month at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, USC sophomore 
Gary Anderson won gold medals in the 200-meter individual medley, the 200-meter 
backstroke, and a silver medal in the 100-meter backstroke while competing for 
Canada. . . . Also at the Games, Glenn Housman of Australia became the second 
swimmer to break the 15-minute mark in the 1,500-meter freestyle, winning in 
14:55.25. In the same race, 16-year-old Kieren Perkins, also of Australia, 
became the third swimmer with a time of 14:58.08. Vladimir Salnikov of the 
Soviet Union holds the world record, 14:54.76.

Less than 24 hours after receiving her diploma from El Dorado High School, 
Janet Evans conducted business as usual Thursday, the first day of the Mission 
Viejo International Meet of Champions at the Marguerite Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete, 
Evans was hardly challenged as she scored an easy victory in the women's 
800-meter freestyle with a time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Bensimon, who lives in Santa Barbara, finished second in 8:55.58. 
Sarah Anderson of Riverside was third (9:00.93). 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who last year set her world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
then pulled away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said Evans, who will attend Stanford in 
the fall. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200-meter 
butterfly in the Mission Viejo meet today, the 400-meter freestyle and 200 
backstroke on Saturday and the 200-meter individual medley, 200 breaststroke 
and 200 freestyle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation experiences the night before, Evans said: "Picking 
up my high school diploma was a little different for me. It was a sad 
experience for me but I was also happy. I'm going to miss high school but I'm 
real excited about starting college at Stanford and I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 800-meter freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat survived a strong 
challenge from Mission Viejo teammate Mariusz Podkoscielny to win in 8:08.62. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who stayed with Wojdat until the final 200 meters, was second in 
8:10.79. U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen came in third in 8:14.86. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to go about 8:10, so I was happy with my time," Wojdat said. "I'm 
right now where I expected to be when the season started." 
</P>
<P>
Said Podkoscielny: "I'm happy with what I did. I led at the halfway point, but 
I didn't lead by enough, and he won the race with his speed at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat and Podkoscielny, who competed for Poland during the 1988 Olympics, and 
Jorgensen, were among four Olympians in the men's event. Lars Jorgensen, Dan's 
brother and 1988 U.S. team member, finished fourth in 8:19.70.

TIMES GET FASTER AFTER HER HEART SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It would strike at any time -- the middle of the night, the beginning of 
practice, en route to class on the USC campus. Without warning, Megan 
Holliday's heart would begin to race, up to 170 beats a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman distance freestyle swimmer from London, Ontario, was born with 
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and has an extra muscle fiber connected to the 
upper and lower chambers of the heart that conducts impulses. When the 
pea-sized extra fiber was functioning, it forced Holliday's heart to beat too 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday noticed the symptoms when she was 11. The rapid heartbeats lasted from 
several minutes to more than an hour, although months would pass without an 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor told her it was only a nuisance that she might grow out of, but 
after Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed and died of a 
heart condition last spring, Holliday's mother, Susan, ordered more tests for 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The tests revealed that Megan is in a high-risk group and could suffer a heart 
attack at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock," Holliday said. "I thought all along it wasn't a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
She was given three options: medication, a catheter ablation procedure or open 
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday decided on the catheter ablation procedure, which would destroy the 
superfluous tissue, because it would not require a lengthy recovery. On Aug. 
20, a Canadian doctor performed the operation, but he was inexperienced with 
the technique and it failed. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival in Southern California, Holliday tried medication, but it 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"I had attacks more often and I was dizzy so the university pulled me out of 
the water," said Holliday, who had 12 episodes in four days. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom frantically called around to find a doctor who could do the catheter 
ablation procedure. We found one in Oklahoma City who had a cancellation, and I 
went on two days' notice." 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-hour procedure, the surgeon, Warren Jackman, positioned a small metal 
electrode into the heart via a catheter. Using a high-frequency electrical 
current, he destroyed the extra fiber. Five days later, Holliday was back in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really thought about it as my life being in danger," she said. "The 
funny thing is, I only worried about not being able to swim. Everyone else 
worried about my health." 
</P>
<P>
Although the procedure was apparently successful, there remains cause for 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get it going too fast, but after a couple of beats it stops," Holliday 
said. "I talked to my doctor (in Los Angeles). He said because I'm tuned to my 
heart so well I'm going to be on the alert for anything abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
During Christmas vacation or spring break, Holliday will be retested. Her heart 
will be stimulated to race to make sure the fiber has not grown back. There is 
an 8% recurrence rate, but according to Jackman, there is no recurrence after a 
second procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Holliday is concentrating on swimming. 
</P>
<P>
As a 15-year-old, she won two bronze medals for Canada in the 1987 Pan American 
Games, but since 1989 she had leveled off -- until last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Even after missing a month of practice, she improved her time by 45 seconds in 
the 1,650-yard freestyle in the U.S. National Grand Prix meet at Belmont Plaza 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Sarah Anderson swam a meet-record 16 minutes 22.82 seconds in winning the 
1,650 freestyle Sunday in the Grand Prix meet. Anderson also won the 500 
freestyle handily at 4:46.32, and the third-ranked Bears won in the women's 
division, beating USC, which is ranked fifth nationally, 1,249.5 to 948.5. 
</P>
<P>
Cal and USC split the four relays, thanks to a strong finish by Cal's Amy 
Tidball in the last event of the meet, the 400 freestyle relay. Tidball was 
caught by Trojan anchor Lisa Dorman at the final turn, but Tidball inched ahead 
in the last 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I just held my breath and it really speeded me up," Tidball said. 
</P>
<P>
All was not lost by Dorman, however. She won the 100 freestyle in 50.87 and set 
a school record in the 50 with a 23.18. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, Arizona State beat USC, 1,111 to 1,022.5. The Trojans were 
without five of their top swimmers. Four were benched by Coach Peter Daland for 
missing practice and Olympian Dave Wharton, preparing for the World 
Championships, swam only in the relays. 
</P>
<P>
The individual highlight on the men's side was Glenn Peoples' 1:59.70 in the 
200 breaststroke. The time would have placed him 15th in last season's NCCA 
meet, a promising effort so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans had a sore throat and finished fifth in the 400 individual medley 
and seventh in the 200 freestyle at the U.S. Open in Indianapolis Nov. 30-Dec. 
1. . . . In the 100 butterfly, Santa Barbara's Brian Alderman upset 1988 
Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty of Surinam and Canada's Marcel Gery, who is 
ranked No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia's Natalie Norberg has come a long way since the U.S. Swimming senior 
nationals in August, in which she finished 44th in the 200 freestyle in 
2:06.46. At the U.S. Open, the 16-year-old from the Industry Hills team won the 
silver medal in 2:02.83. . . . Texas sophomore Erika Hansen will not be able to 
compete in the World Championships because of a virus. Longhorn teammate Katy 
Arris will replace her in the 400 freestyle and Julie Kole, who recently made 
an unwritten commitment to attend Stanford next year, will swim the 800 
freestyle in her place. 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding James (Doc) Councilman is like trying to replace John Wooden, Bear 
Bryant, or Woody Hayes. It hasn't been done successfully by the initial 
successor. No wonder the going is rough for Indiana's new coach, Kris Kirchner. 
For the first time since 1956, the Hoosiers lost a dual meet to Purdue. . . . 
Matt Biondi, Tom Jager and Eric Hansen competed in Flagstaff, Ariz., last 
Saturday in two heats of the 50-meter freestyle before 325 at the Northern 
Arizona Natatorium. Organizers hoped for a world record, but the fastest time 
was Hansen's 23.08, well off Jager's world-record 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
COMING MEETS -- International: World Aquatic Championships, Jan. 3-13, in 
Perth, Australia, includes diving, water polo and synchronized swimming. Swim 
dates are Jan. 6-13 and include first time long-distance (25 kilometers) race 
in the Swan River. NCAA, Men: UC Irvine Invitational, Jan. 5-6; Men and Women: 
UC Santa Barbara Invitational, Jan. 3-5; Arizona State Invitational, Jan. 
10-13.

TEAM'S SPECIALTY IS GOING THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tracy Dodds 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. national team of distance swimmers broke the Long Beach-to-Catalina 
channel relay record Aug. 11, taking one-hour shifts and completing the channel 
swim in 7 hours 2 minutes 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Wilkerson, Jim McConica, Martha Jahn, Karen Burton, Chad Hundeby and Erica 
Reetz shattered the previous record of 12 hours 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
So, which is more of a surprise? That the record was broken by more than five 
hours or that there is, indeed, a national team of distance swimmers? 
</P>
<P>
"People really don't know what we're doing in distance swimming," U.S. Coach 
Penny Dean said. "Since we set the record as a U.S. team, I've had 15 or 20 
athletes contact me saying that they would like to be considered for the 
national team for the World Championships. These are athletes who didn't even 
know we had a team." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the team is still forming. 
</P>
<P>
To select a team for the Catalina crossing, Dean held a 25-kilometer qualifying 
race and then kept the top three men and the top three women. She worked with 
that group for a week, taking them to different beaches in the Los Angeles 
area, teaching them to deal with kelp and with swimming in the dark -- things 
that lap swimmers don't have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other U.S. swimmers training for distance and there are several 
more who would like to be included on the U.S. team that will compete in the 
distances swims scheduled to be included with the swimming events at the World 
Championships in Australia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
FINA, the international governing body for swimming, will be meeting then and 
might vote to include distance swimming as an Olympic medal event in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dean, FINA could decide to add the 800-meter freestyle relay for 
women to the pool events as well as adding a 16-mile swim (not a relay) for 
individual men's and women's medals, even though it would probably be a 
competition that the men and the women swim concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, who currently holds the individual records for both the English Channel 
swim and the Catalina Channel swim, has had to retire from distance swimming 
because of a problem with her left arm. She is the women's swim coach and water 
polo coach at Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
A team of women representing the Dolphin Club of San Francisco set the women's 
relay record for swimming the English Channel last week. The Channel Swimming 
Federation confirmed their time of 10 hours 49 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Drucker, Susan Cobbe, Carol McGrath, Joani Beemsterboer, Susan Allen and 
Lisa Smith raised the money for the trip and for the official pilot and pilot 
boat (about $2,000) and set out on what they considered an adventure and a 
longshot at the record. Karen Drucker in her phone call home to Los Angeles to 
announce the successful crossing said that it was "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
USC will be the host of a college invitational swim meet, the Grand Prix, Dec. 
1-3 at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Darrell Fick, the USC women's 
coach, said that he expects to have 10 schools each in men's and women's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
So far the men's teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona 
State and Cal State Long Beach, and he expects to add Michigan and Texas. The 
women's teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona State, 
Michigan, Tennessee and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is attempting to put together a 50-yard match race between Tom Jager and 
Matt Biondi, but he has a mountain of red tape to work through on that project. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford women's swim team will include Janet Evans, who has made several 
appearances at the Belmont Plaza pool in the past as a Placentia El Dorado High 
School swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' sweep at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo last month followed by her sweep 
in the Alamo Cup competition against the Soviet team in Atlanta stretched her 
victory streak to 25. She hasn't lost a national or international race (the 
only ones U.S. swimming is counting or the list would be longer) since August 
of 1987 when she lost the 800-meter freestyle in the Pan Pacific Games in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Evans lowered her world record in the 800 during the last Pan Pacific Games, 
swimming an 8:16.22. Her world record was the second for the U.S. team on the 
day that the swimmers set an unprecedented four. 
</P>
<P>
There have never before been four world records set on one day, although there 
were three set July 19, 1976, during the Olympic Games in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman started it when he lowered his own world record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke to 2:12.89. David Wharton got his world record back with a 2:00.11 
in the 200-meter individual medley, and Jager got his world record back when he 
swam a 22.12-second 50. 
</P>
<P>
Jager had lost his world record to Matt Biondi during the Olympic Games last 
fall in Seoul when Biondi won the gold and Jager won the silver. They have now 
passed the world record in the 50 back and forth five times. 
</P>
<P>
Jager and Biondi have raced only once since the Olympics. They were scheduled 
to meet in the national long course meet at USC last month, but Jager was 
disqualified for a false start and had to leave the starting blocks to the boos 
and angry chants of a capacity crowd who thought the official had erred. 
</P>
<P>
The disqualification of Jager from the 50-meter freestyle at the national long 
course meet in Los Angeles last month brought to mind a similar unpopular false 
start call against Mark Spitz -- who was disqualified from a much-anticipated 
100-meter race against Frank Heckl the last time the national meet was held at 
USC in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team victory over the Soviet team in Atlanta last month ran the U.S. 
team's record to 6-0 over the Soviets in dual meets. The series dates back to 
1971. In the Alamo Cup, the U.S. men won their competition, 91-78, and the U.S. 
women won, 106-56. 
</P>
<P>
Hired to attract corporate sponsorship and sell advertising in the official 
program, the Mazza Marketing Group generated $20,850 in connection with the 
Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National Championship swim meet held at 
USC last month. Most of that money will go to the swimming program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some controversy in the past weeks over whether USC is required 
to open the pool on its campus to the public. The pool was built by McDonald's 
on USC land for the 1984 Olympic Games, and, at the time, there was the 
understanding that although USC would control use of the pool after the Games, 
there would be some public use. No one has been able to find that stipulation 
in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
USC has made the pool available to many local swimming organizations for both 
training and meets and does allow serious lap swimmers use of the pool from 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. However, there is no recreational swim time. Swimmers 
must provide proof that they are 16 or older and they must pass a swimming 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jim Dennis, vice president of student affairs at USC, explains that the 
pool does not meet standards for a public recreational-use pool. There is no 
shallow area. It is a 50-meter pool that ranges in depth from 6-feet-7 to 17 
feet. And the lane markers are almost always in place. Users are required to 
pay $25 a semester to help cover the cost of operation.

<LEADPARA>  While the heavily favored United States swimmers continued to struggle in the
racing portion of the World Championships on Tuesday, two Concord performers
made their mark on the synchronized swimming portion of the competition in
Perth, Australia.;    Twins Sarah and Karen Josephson, of Concord and the
Walnut Creek Aquanuts, gave the United States its second gold medal of the
championships, winning the duet competition with a world-record score of
199.762 points.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  JOSEPHSON SISTERS CAPTURE GOLD MEDALS
CONCORD WOMEN ESTABLISH WORLD RECORD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Sports Digest  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The pair scored two 10s for technical merit and six 10s for artistic
impression with their routine. They earned a record  average for the figures
section (99.520) swum last weekend, before totaling a world's best duet score
of 100.242.;    The previous record was set by Canadian duo Carolyn Waldo and
Michelle Cameron in winning the Olympic gold at the 1988 Seoul Games.;    This
world title is a welcome breakthrough for the Josephsons, who have had to be
content with silver at the 1986 world championships in Madrid, at the FINA
World Cup in 1987 and the Seoul Olympics.;    They took a year off in 1989 and
made a comeback for this meet.;    "It's great to be back," they said, in
perfect unison, after their win.;    As for the races, the top effort in the
second day of competition came courtesy of Stanford's Janet Evans, who
captured a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle, and the men's 800
freestyle relay, which also earned silver medals. Former San Jose resident and
1988 Olympian Troy Dalbey swam the opening leg for the U.S. team.;    "Our
best days are yet to come," Evans said. "We had a few disappointments but . .
. we're doing OK.";    The U.S. team could pick up some gold today, with Evans
a heavy favorite in the 400 freestyle and Matt Biondi the  prohibitive pick in
the men's 100 freestyle.;    Biondi, the star of the U.S. Olympic swim team in
Seoul, had a rematch with Olympic conqueror Anthony Nesty of Surinam in the
100 butterfly. But Nesty instead battled Germany's Michael Gross to the wire
for the gold while Biondi placed sixth.;    Stanford's Jill Johnson was
eliminated from the 200 breaststroke competition in a preliminary heat.;
TENNIS: Andre Agassi was slapped with the maximum fine -- $25,000 -- by the
Grand Slam Committee for pulling out of and then belittling the inaugural
Grand Slam Cup in December, a controversial $6 million tournament boycotted by
some other top players. The committee also had the power to ban Agassi from
one or more of this year's Grand Slam events -- the Australian, French and
U.S. Opens and Wimbledon -- but decided not to impose such a penalty. . . .
Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Alexia Dechaume 6-3, 6-1 early
today in a second-round match of the New South Wales Open in Sydney,
Australia. In the men's competition, Magnus Gustaffson upset No. 2 seed Jonas
Svensson 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.; BOXING: Former welterweight champion Mark Breland,
27, will fight a yet-to-be-named opponent on Feb. 4 in Albany, N.Y. Breland
(27-2-1) said he wants to prove he's not through even though he hasn't fought
since losing his World Boxing Association title to Aaron Davis in July.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WITH THE world and NCAA championships now past, the next swim meet with
Olympic implications -- and the most important meet of the year in this
country -- is the U.S. Spring Nationals beginning Wednesday in Federal Way,
Wash., near Seattle.;    Stanford's Janet Evans, a double-gold medalist at the
January worlds in Perth, Australia, is one of three world-record holders

Tennessee. The meet will draw more than 1,000 swimmers.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SPRING NATIONALS NEXT FOR EVANS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Olympic Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Evans, the world's fastest woman in the 400-, 800- and 1,500-meter
freestyle, will be accompanied by Cardinal teammate Summer Sanders, who won
the 200 butterfly in Perth.;    Even though the Spring Nationals is the last
competition of a tough three-month stretch, it's important because it
qualifies swimmers for the U.S. teams sent to the remaining three
international meets of this year.;    The top two swimmers in each event go to
Edmonton, Alberta, in August for the Pan Pacific Championships. The Pan
Pacific competition, organized by Australia, Canada, Japan and the United
States and held every two years, requires that those four nations commit their
best swimmers. Also eligible to compete are the nations of South America.;   
After the Pan Pacific team is selected, the next two swimmers in each event
qualify for the Pan-American Games, also in August, in Havana, Cuba. The
Pan-Ams are the Western Hemisphere's mini-Olympics and are held only in a
pre-Olympic year. The next two swimmers who are eligible are assigned to the
national team for the World University Games in July in Sheffield, England.;  
 Because of the international implications of the meet, it has been switched
from the short-course (25-yard pool) format previously used in non-Olympic
years to the long-course (50-meters, about twice the short course) pool used
last year for all aquatic competition at the Goodwill Games. International
meets are held in the long-course format.;    Swimmers for the 1991 U.S.
Olympic Festival are also drawn from the Spring Nationals. U.S. Swimming, the
sport's national governing body, uses the Olympic Festival, to be held July
12-21 in Los Angeles, as a development event. The 104 swimmers chosen must be
18 or under and never named to a U.S. national team.;    Ex-Cal swimmer Matt
Biondi, who holds the world mark in the 100-meter freestyle, decided not to
enter the Spring Nationals and will instead use his exemption as a member of
the U.S. team at the worlds to qualify for future national teams based on his
times at Perth.;  JENNER GETS JOYNER-KERSEE: Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
world-record holder in the heptathlon, says she will compete at the Bruce
Jenner Classic on May 25 at San Jose City College.;    Joyner-Kersee, who will
be concentrating this year on The Athletics Congress national meet in New York
in June and the world track and field championships in Tokyo in August,
withdrew from last year's Jenner meet with an injury.;    The Pan-Am Games
don't figure in her plans, partly because they're scheduled too soon before
the world championships, but also because of continuing concern among U.S.
athletes over problems with setting up a drug-testing system in Havana.;   
"You can't take chances with that, especially when the procedures are not set
up right," she said. "People are not going to investigate it and read through
it and say they did not have it set up right. Your name is smeared now. You
urinate in a plastic bottle that -- who knows what's going to happen to it
now?";  BREAKING THE ICE: Julie Parisien's giant slalom victory in Waterville
Valley, N.H., last week was the United States' first World Cup victory since
retired ace Tamara McKinney won a 1987 slalom.;    The four-year drought was
the longest period in World Cup history without a U.S. victory.;    Eva
Twardokens of Santa Cruz was sixth and San Leandro-native Edith Thys was
23rd.;    Toni Standteiner of Olympic Valley, a member of the University of
Colorado ski team, won a silver medal in the giant slalom earlier this month
at the Winter World University Games in Sapporo, Japan.;  SOLICITING GOODWILL:
The site selection committee for the 1998 Goodwill Games, which founder Ted
Turner promises will be held despite huge losses on the first two runs in
Moscow and Seattle, has invited San Francisco to submit a bid.;    Thirty-one
other cities in the United States and Canada are being solicited. There's no
word on any city other than New York expressing interest in having the event.
The '94 Goodwill Games will be in Leningrad, Soviet Union.  </TEXT>

BIONDI, EVANS TRYING TO PROVE THEMSELVES, DESPITE '88 GOLDS 
</P>

<P>
Shouldn't eight gold medals mean never having to say you're sorry? 
</P>
<P>
Those were some of the spoils that U.S. swimmers Matt Biondi and Janet Evans 
brought home from the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Biondi also won a silver 
and a bronze. So, perhaps naturally, both were a little bewildered with the 
notion that they had to prove themselves again Sunday at the King County 
Aquatics Center. 
</P>
<P>
And when the third day of the Goodwill Games ended, Evans did not appear much 
more excited about her victory than Biondi felt depressed about his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's far too much pressure to win in American sports," Biondi said, 
shrugging off the loss but not his sub-par performance. 
</P>
<P>
For Biondi, it seems as if more attention has been focused in the last two 
years on one of the two gold medals he let get away in Seoul than on the five 
he won. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-meter butterfly, he had a clear lead until the finish, when he 
misjudged his stroke into the wall and was out-touched by Surinam's Anthony 
Nesty. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi had an opportunity to even the score Sunday when he met Nesty in the 
same event for the first time since Seoul, but he failed. 
</P>
<P>
As for Evans, one of the rare disappointments of her career came Saturday, when 
she lost for the first time in four years in the 400-meter individual medley. 
The surprise winner was fellow Californian Summer Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Although Evans did not react well to the theme of vindication suggested in 
Sunday's newspapers, she did have an opportunity to continue her winning streak 
in the 400-meter freestyle. She has not lost in that event since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Her task did not appear simple because one of her competitors was 200-meter 
world record-holder Heike Friedrich of East Germany. In Seoul, Evans held off 
two surges in the last 50 meters of the 400 freestyle by Friedrich to win the 
gold medal in a world-record time of 4:03.85 that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Evans did not approach that Sunday, although her time of 4:05.84 was enough to 
win the race and tie for the fourth-fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise silver medalist, Haley Lewis, 15, of Australia, finished almost 
five seconds behind in 4:10.78. Friedrich finished seventh in 4:18.32. 
</P>
<P>
So Evans is back? 
</P>
<P>
Where did she go? 
</P>
<P>
Even though she lost the day before, she said Sunday that she was more pleased 
with that silver medal -- which came with a time that was only two seconds off 
her personal record in the 400 individual medley -- than she was with the gold 
medal in the 800 freestyle that she won Friday night. She was 12 seconds behind 
her personal record in that race. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference Sunday to describe her Saturday night, Evans said 
she went to a movie, dinner and bed. "It was nothing different," she said. "You 
just have to put that (the loss) behind you, and you have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she asked a reporter, "What did people expect me to do, go back to the 
room and bawl my eyes out?" 
</P>
<P>
Biondi said Evans was her same, cheerful self Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just hopping around and supporting the team," he said. "I don't know 
why, but it seems like more people were interested in her loss yesterday than 
in her win today. Certainly, more people are talking about her loss than Summer 
Sanders' win." 
</P>
<P>
Nesty can empathize with Sanders. His victory in Seoul is better known as 
Biondi's loss. 
</P>
<P>
Nesty, who swims for the University of Florida, said he was thinking about that 
before the start of Sunday's rematch, which Biondi was expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous, I couldn't stand it," Nesty said. "I was big-time nervous. I 
guess that's what Matt does to me." 
</P>
<P>
It showed in the first 50 meters, when Biondi, who was just off the 
world-record pace, had the lead. But Nesty caught him with 25 meters remaining 
and won a clear victory. His time was 53.42 to Biondi's 53.82. The difference 
between them in Seoul was .01. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi said that the loss did not upset him because Nesty has proved himself as 
better in the butterfly. But Biondi was upset with their times. Those same 
times in Seoul would have placed them fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I lost in Seoul helped me to train better in the butterfly, and 
I did," Biondi said. "I got up at 5:45 every morning and would swim six hours a 
day, all for this moment. Then it happens, and I didn't swim anywhere near as 
fast as I expected. That's what makes this so disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
But the sun was still shining, something to be thankful for in the Pacific 
Northwest, and Biondi could still laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's look at the good side," he said. "I did finish a lot better than I did 
in '88."

SWIM MEET OF CHAMPIONS; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS HAS EASY WIN IN THE 800

<P>
Less than 24 hours after she received her diploma from El Dorado High School in 
Placentia, Janet Evans conducted business as usual Thursday, the first day of 
the Mission Viejo Chrysler Motors International Swim Meet of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete 
during the four-day meet, Evans won easily in the 800-meter freestyle with a 
time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Ensimon, who lives in Santa Barbara, finished second in 8:55.58, 
followed by Sarah Anderson of Riverside, who had a time of 9:00.93. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who last year set the world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
pulled away from the field to win by 25 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said Evans, who will attend Stanford in 
the fall. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200 butterfly today; 
the 400 freestyle and 200 backstroke Saturday, and the 200 individual medley, 
200 freestyle and 200 breaststroke Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation the night before, Evans said: "Picking up my high 
school diploma was a little different. It was a sad experience for me, but I 
was also happy. I'm going to miss high school, but I'm real excited about 
starting college." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the men's 800 freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat overcame a strong 
challenge from fellow Pole Mariusz Podkoscielny to take the event with a time 
of 8:08.62. Both swim for the Mission Viejo Nadadores team. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who finished second in 8:10.79, stayed with Wojdat until Wojdat 
edged ahead with 200 meters left. U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen finished third in 
8:14.86.

<LEADPARA>  If Jeff Rouse's clumsiness extended from staircases to the swimming pool, his
career might be in jeopardy.;    Rouse, whose junior season at Stanford was
shortened after he broke his left wrist falling down the stairs at home, is
doing just fine in the pool. On Friday, he solidified his status as one of the
world's top backstrokers by beating a loaded field in the 100 meters at the
Santa Clara International Invitational Swim Meet.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DIFFERENT STROKES
DESPITE WRIST, ROUSE HAS ROUSING WIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rouse's winning effort, 56.59 seconds, was witnessed by an estimated 2,800
fans at the Santa Clara International Swim Center and came against five of the
world's top 17-ranked 100-meter backstrokers.;    And aside from Rouse, ranked
No. 2 in the world, others turning top performances included:;    (check)
Stanford's Summer Sanders, capturing the women's 400 individual medley in 4
minutes, 51.14 seconds.;    (check) High school phenom Joe Hudepohl, winning
the men's 200 freestyle in 1:51.23.;    (check) Soviet Sergei Marinuk, setting
a meet record of 4 minutes, 21.42 seconds in the men's 400 I.M. In all, the
Soviets won three of the eight individual events, and its men's 800 relay team
set a meet record of 7:37.34.;    Rouse's victory, however, was perhaps the
most impressive individual accomplishment because of who he beat.;    Among
his competitors were Alexander Popov of the Soviet Union (57.01), an
up-and-comer who was the fastest qualifier in the event; Mark Tewksbury
(57.99), a member of the 1988 Canadian Olympic team who entered ranked No. 3
in the world; Vladimir Shemetov of the Soviet Union (58.17), the bronze
medalist at last year's Goodwill Games; Stanford teammate Derek Weatherford
(58.27), ranked 17th in the world; and Vladimir Selkov of the Soviet Union,
the world's 15th-ranked backstroker who was disqualified after a false start.;
   And Rouse did it with a wrist that's still not 100 percent. He broke it in
early February, shortly after winning the world championship in the 100
backstroke in Australia.;    He returned in March to win the NCAA title but
skipped the U.S. Spring Nationals in April to rest the wrist.;    "If
anything," he said, "the injury gave me another type of goal -- the extra
motivation to overcome this.";    The victory didn't come easily because Popov
stayed with Rouse the entire race.;    "I didn't know what to expect from
him," Rouse said of the world's 14th-ranked backstroker. "I didn't know how
fast he could go."; ETC.: Matt Biondi finished sixth in the men's 100
butterfly at 57.08. . . . Kyoko Iwasaki, 12, of Japan, was second in the
women's 200 breaststroke at 2:35.99. . . . Japan's Yoko Tsukashima defended
her title in the women's 200 butterfly, winning in 2:15.01. . . . Trials begin
at 9:30 a.m. today, with finals scheduled for 4 p.m. The meet continues
through Sunday.  </TEXT>

EVANS, BIONDI IN RUNNING FOR SULLIVAN AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, the Southern California swimmers who starred in 
the Olympics at Seoul, are among 10 finalists for the Sullivan Award, given 
each year to the outstanding amateur athlete in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming was the only sport with two finalists when the list was cut down from 
46 by the Amateur Athletic Union's selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced March 6 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who took only a brief break from swimming after the Olympics, is back 
competing for Placentia's El Dorado High School. On Jan. 16 at Long Beach, she 
set a U.S. record in the 1,650-yard freestyle at 15 minutes 44.98 seconds, 
taking more than a second and a half off the nearly 6-year-old record set by 
Tiffany Cohen, 15:46.54. 
</P>
<P>
Look for more American records to fall now that Evans will be swimming some 
major meets in yards, distances unique to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since Evans broke her first world record in July, 1987, the major meets have 
been long course (meters) in preparation for the '88 Olympic Games. But the 
U.S. swimmers will be competing in yards in some major meets, including the 
Phillips 66-U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals at Chapel Hill, N.C., March 
21-25. 
</P>
<P>
At that meet, Evans is expected to swim the 400-yard individual medley, the 
500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard individual medley and the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1,650 record already in hand, she will skip that event in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi isn't doing any competitive swimming these days, but he has been staying 
in shape to be ready for the tryouts for the U.S. water polo team, to be held 
at Newport Beach Feb. 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the water polo team retired after the 1988 Games, Coach Bill 
Barnett has a lot of spaces to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Besides doing speaking engagements and some commercial appearances, Biondi was 
back in the waters off the coast of Florida, swimming with dolphins for an 
ABC-TV special with Curt Gowdy that shows an apparent special communication 
between dolphins and children with Down's syndrome. ABC will televise the 
special April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi also has been kept pretty busy accepting awards and still has a few more 
to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi already has been named United Press International's sportsman of the 
year and the United States Olympic Committee's sportsman of the year. Not to 
mention being named Italian-American man of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in a long list of appointments is his Feb. 3 date at Boca Raton, Fla., 
for a basketball slam dunk contest against the likes of Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is staying busy, Biondi isn't cashing in on his 7 medals. When he 
passed through New York last month on a tour of 12 cities in 8 days, Biondi 
told John Nelson of the Associated Press that he was in the wrong sport for 
making big bucks. And, he said, 1988 wasn't the best Olympic year for cashing 
in, either. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to get rich from these Olympics except maybe Flo Jo, if she 
plays it right," Biondi said, referring to track star Florence Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many controversies -- steroids, television, the boxing -- and 
then there was the time difference. I think people got kind of turned off. 
Advertisers realize that. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one advertiser's quote. He said, 'Our company would rather sponsor 
events than athletes, because events don't do drugs or beat their wives.' It's 
getting harder for the athlete instead of easier." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why swimming isn't as potentially lucrative as other Olympic sports 
such as boxing or figure skating, and why swimmers don't draw top endorsements, 
Biondi said: "The Olympics is only once every 4 years, and for that magical 
week, everybody is watching and reading about it. But to stay on top, you have 
to be heard from a little more often than that." 
</P>
<P>
USC and UCLA are undefeated in swimming this season. USC is 6-0 and already has 
10 swimmers qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet. That's 
the most the Trojans have ever qualified before the Pac-10 meet. 
</P>
<P>
Helping build that total are the 1988 Olympians on the USC team, who missed the 
first semester because of the trip to Seoul but are allowed to use Olympic 
times for qualifying times. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are competing this weekend in the Dallas Classic at Southern 
Methodist, swimming against SMU, Texas, Stanford, California and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (7-0) already have Mark Dean qualified for the NCAA meet. Dean 
qualified for the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:47.25 in a meet against 
Arizona State Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Bruin team is breaststroker Andrea Cecci, who was the Italian 
national champion in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans and the Bruins are both 2-0 in the Pac-10. They will not meet until 
Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The USC women's swim team is 5-4 and has four women qualified for the NCAA 
meet. Leslie Daland and Kathy Hettche have qualified in the 1,650 -- Daland at 
16:33.63 and Hettche at 16:37.93 -- as well as Leslie Seward in the 200-yard 
breaststroke and Terri O'Loughlin in the 100-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women are 8-1 after a big victory at Cal last weekend. The Bruin women 
have lost only to Stanford, which is as strong as usual. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming, in keeping with its philosophy of getting international 
experience for a wide range of swimmers, is sending a team of 6 to the 
Coca-Cola International Meet at Paris Feb. 3-5 and the Meetings Arena at Bonn, 
West Germany, Feb. 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
On the team will be Steve Crocker of St. Louis, Matt Rankin of the Click Tucson 
team, Beth Barr of the Greater Pensacola Swim Team, Whitney Hedgepeth of the 
Virginia Assn. for Competitive Aquatics, Ann Mahoney of the Wichita Swim Club 
and Jenny Thompson of the Seacost Swim Team. Jay Fitzgerald of the Santa Clara 
Swim Club is going as the coach.

National swim team coaches from the United States, Hong Kong and Australia 
suspect the Chinese women's team of using steroids in the wake of China's 
world-best performances during last month's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Quick, coach of the U.S. national team and Stanford women's team, said 
he felt obligated to speak out after the Chinese produced three times that rank 
No. 1 in the world this year and three others that are No. 2 during the 
competition at Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of whispering about it with the East Germans, and I'm not going to 
whisper about it with the Chinese," Quick said during the weekend. "I think 
they've improved very quickly. I know some coaches who have watched them, and 
their ability to recover in practice is phenomenal. It is either extremely 
sophisticated training with the proper nutrition and massage, or it is with 
artificial aids." 
</P>
<P>
Said Australia's national team coach, Bill Sweetenham, who worked with the 
Chinese as recently as February: "I hope they are not doing it (using 
steroids), but I question their rapid improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a very positive advocate of the Chinese, their strict discipline and the 
Spartan attitude toward their training. Their high-altitude training is very 
significant, as is the socialist system. You are dealing with people who have 
nothing, and all of a sudden if they perform well they get something." 
</P>
<P>
The suspicions have been fueled by the quick improvement of the Chinese 
performances and what the coaches consider a familiar pattern. "It seems like 
we're seeing the same rapid improvement the East Germans had, and they (the 
Chinese) had help from the East Germans," said Sweetenham, Australia's Olympic 
coach from 1980-88. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coach David Haller, whose Hong Kong national team swam against the 
Chinese during the Asian Games, the Chinese women have made significant weight 
gains and developed deep voices. Those are common side effects of steroids, 
muscle-building drugs that some consider to be performance-enhancing. 
</P>
<P>
China's national team coach, Yunpeng Chen, denied the allegations from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Chen said. "In China, our swimming association forbids it, and you 
know at the Asian Games we have serious doping control." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Chinese swimmers tested positive for any banned substance at the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Chen said his team has had East German help. East German Coach Klaus Rudolf 
went to China in 1986 for eight months to share training techniques. Chen also 
learned from the Americans during 1979-80 when he studied at Springfield 
College in Massachusetts, and from the Australians in 1983 when he observed 
Coach Dennis Pursley's methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about the East German system of weight training, high-altitude 
training, dry-land and aquatic training," Chen said. "Then I mixed the 
Australian, U.S.A. and East German training methods to make the Chinese 
method." 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, because of his current position as U.S. national team director, would 
not address the question of steroids with regard to the Chinese. However, he 
did attend the Asian Games and was willing to share his views of the Chinese 
program, which Chen said has about 25,000 swimmers. The Chinese population is 
estimated at 1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really surprised me is that they really haven't scratched the 
surface," Pursley said. "They have a small number of swimmers and they don't 
have sophisticated talent identification or networking methods." 
</P>
<P>
In a report Pursley prepared for U.S. Swimming, he wrote: "It doesn't appear 
that the success of the Chinese program can be attributed to any 'secret' 
training methods that are unknown to the rest of the world. The training 
program is based on a solid work ethic and utilizes traditional methods of 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Quick also credits the Chinese training, saying that the swimmers could not 
improve on artificial aids alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The major benefit from steroids is that you can train so much more effectively 
so many more times," he said. "So you can get off them in time before the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Quick added that female swimmers benefit from steroids more than males. 
</P>
<P>
"And (improvement) has come in the power events first, the shorter events, the 
100s, and then the 200s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Voy, former chief medical officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
gives credence to Quick's belief that steroids have a greater impact on women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have male hormone receptor sites that require very little male hormone 
to fill," Voy said. "They can get that by using smaller doses and getting 
bigger gains." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, however, offered several reasons for the success of the women as opposed 
to the men, including the belief that the fastest women can train against 
faster men while the fastest men have no one to push them. 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the average height of Chinese women is only an inch 
shorter, at 5 feet 8, than the average height of female finalists in the 1988 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
He says the average height of the Chinese male swimmer is 5-11, three inches 
shorter than the average height of male Olympic finalists in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to power events, the only world record the Chinese women have is in 
the shortest event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Wenyi Yang, who set the mark at 24.98 seconds in 1988, has gone as fast as 
25.51 this year and is one of five Chinese women with world-best times in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The others are: Yong Zhuang in the 100 freestyle (55.12), Xiaomin Huang in the 
100 breaststroke (1:09.70), Xiaohong Wang in the 100 butterfly (58.87) and Li 
Lin in the 200 individual medley (2:13.16). Wang's time and the 58.89 turned in 
by teammate Hong Qian represent the second- and third-fastest times in history 
behind the world record of 57.93 set by Mary T. Meagher of the United States in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has seven individual world bests this year -- four by 
freestyler Janet Evans, two by butterflyer-medleyist Summer Sanders and one by 
100 backstroker Betsy Mitchell. This year's other bests are by Hungarian 200 
backstroker Kristina Egerszegi and 200 breaststroker Elena Volkova of the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Quick fears steroid users will not be caught through the testing procedures at 
the World Championships or the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
One former member of the East German women's team acknowledged in a Toronto Sun 
article recently that she used steroids and said that many of her teammates 
used the banned substances, but none of the swimmers tested positive during 
competition. During the U.S. Olympic trials in 1988, Angel Myers tested 
positive for a banned substance and was taken off the team, but those cases are 
generally the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Said Voy: "Only someone who misjudges a dose or gets greedy and takes too much, 
a la Ben Johnson, is going to get caught. With an eight- to 10-week cycle they 
can get off within two weeks of the competition date and still get a lot of the 
positive effects of the drug."

JANET EVANS DECIDES TO SWIM FOR STANFORD; 
</P>
<P>
SHE PICKS THE CARDINAL OVER TEXAS, FLORIDA

<P>
Janet Evans, who won three gold medals swimming in the Olympics, said Thursday 
she has signed a letter of intent to attend Stanford in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a senior at El Dorado High School, has been besieged by recruiters in 
recent weeks. She said she chose Stanford for its academics and its strong swim 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal women's team won the 1989 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. swim 
championship. Stanford also won the title in 1983 and has never finished lower 
than third since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I feel I've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history," said Stanford women's swimming coach Richard Quick, who was coach of 
the 1988 U.S. Olympic swimming team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time deciding," Evans said. "Texas, Florida and Stanford all have 
good programs. But I really like girls on the team at Stanford. I liked the 
school and I can get a good education there." 
</P>
<P>
Evans said she plans to major in communications. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working with people and I would like to do something in broadcasting," 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to swim in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds world records in the 400-meter individual medley, 400 freestyle and 
800 freestyle. She won gold medals in all three events last September at the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Her victories in Seoul brought numerous endorsement offers. However, Evans said 
that she turned down the offers to maintain her amateur standing. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was tempting, but I've always wanted to swim in college," Evans 
said. "I didn't want to forfeit my education. I'm 17, I want to be a kid for a 
while longer." 
</P>
<P>
Evans began gaining attention in 1986 as she won two bronze medals at the 
Goodwill Games in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Her small stature (5-foot-4, less than 100 pounds) and unorthodoxed style of 
swimming, which El Dorado Coach Tom Milich once likened to a Cuisinart, made 
her unique. Evans said she takes 52 strokes of freestyle per 50-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Swimming Open in 1987, Evans set world records in the 400 freestyle 
(4 minutes 5.45 seconds), 800 freestyle (8:24.71 seconds) and 400 individual 
medley (4:39.75). She later lowered her time in the 400 freestyle to 4:03.85. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first American woman swimmer to hold three world records at one 
time since Debbie Meyer held four in 1968. The last women swimmer to hold three 
was Kornelia Ender of East Germany in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her international success, Evans continued to swim for her high school 
team. Last year she set national high school records in the 500-yard freestyle 
(4:37.30) and 200 individual medley (2:00.72). 
</P>
<P>
She is favored to win those event again Saturday in the Southern Section 3-A 
finals at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest decision I ever had to make," Evans said. "My parents said 
they would support whatever decision I made. I weighed the pros and cons and 
picked Stanford. I'm really happy with the decision and think it's for the 
best."

Janet Evans, who won three gold medals in swimming at the 1988 Seoul Olympic

<LEADPARA>  Mark Spitz didn't even come close to beating Olympian Tom Jager in a 50-meter
butterfly match race Saturday, the first test of the 41-year-old swimmer's
comeback try.;    Spitz, the winner of seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer
Olympics, finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Jager, 26.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SPITZ'S COMEBACK GETS A SLOW START
'72 OLYMPIC STAR IS NO MATCH FOR JAGER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Jager, the world champion and world-record holder in the 50 freestyle,
earned $20,000 for the victory. Spitz got $10,000.;    Jager got a strong
start and swam across the pool in 24.92 seconds. Spitz finished in 26.70.;   
"I don't think the loss was disappointing," Spitz said. "I hate to admit that
I was probably swimming for second, but I thought I could swim in the low
25s.";    Spitz called it nerves.;    "I think I could have walked across the
pool faster than I swam across it, the nerves were so great," Spitz said.;   
Spitz lagged at the start, then briefly caught Jager just before the 25-meter
mark. After that, Spitz almost appeared to be swimming in slow motion.;    "I
got it handed to me nicely and decisively by the fastest guy in the world,"
Spitz said. "I'm sure I'll feel a lot more relaxed now that I've got one under
my belt.";    It was the first time in 18 1/2 years that Spitz had raced
competitively. The last time was at the '72 Munich Olympics.;    A year and a
half ago, he made the improbable announcement that he was starting to train
again with the hope of making the '92 U.S. Olympic team in the 100 butterfly.;
   He enlisted the help of UCLA swimming coach Ron Ballatore. Ballatore agreed
with Spitz that nerves were a factor in the race.;    "I feel that if he were
to have relaxed more and kept his stroke he would have done a lot better,"
Ballatore said. "He hasn't looked like that at all in practice.";    Neither
Spitz nor Ballatore disclosed practice times, but Spitz said he has swum at
least a second faster in practice and believes he can do so in his next match
race.;    On April 27, he will meet Matt Biondi, a 1988 Olympic silver
medalist in the 100 butterfly. The winner will take home $35,000 of a $50,000
purse.  </TEXT>

Mike Barrowman of the United States set a world record in the men's 200-meter 
breaststroke Friday at Tacoma, Wash., in a time of 2:11.53. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman bettered his own record of 2:12.89 set Aug. 20, 1989, at the Pan 
Pacific Games in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matt Biondi defeated fellow American Tom Jager in the 50-meter 
freestyle for the first gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who won five gold medals at the Seoul Olympics two years ago, swam the 
fifth fastest time ever in the 50 in beating his archrival. Biondi won in 22.10 
seconds. Jager was second in 22.31, far off his world record of 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the seventh time Biondi has beaten Jager in 19 meetings in the 50. 
Vladimir Tkachenko of the Soviet Union was third in 22.57. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's volleyball team overcame a slow start to defeat Peru at 
Spokane, Wash., as the round-robin tournament began with a rematch of the 
teams' 1988 Olympic silver-medal encounter. 
</P>
<P>
In another match, Brazil beat Canada, 15-5, 15-2, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which won the gold medal at the Olympic Games at Seoul, 
played the United States in a later Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
China won in four games over Olympic silver-medalist Peru, 15-5, 7-15, 15-13 
and 15-7, before a crowd of 1,000 at the 6,216-seat Spokane Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Seoul was a big game. This was for friendship, so we were not so nervous," 
Chinese player Li Guojun said. "This game was not as tough, but we both could 
have played better." 
</P>
<P>
Peru, with four players from the Olympic squad, suffered from a lack of 
preparation, according to Cenaida Uribe Medina, a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the players were playing in Italy and Brazil and unable to practice 
together," she said.

EVANS KEYS STANFORD TO BIG LEAD OVER CAL

The Stanford women's swim team continued to dominate the Pacific 10 women's 
swimming and diving championships, winning five of seven events Saturday night 
at East Los Angeles College. Stanford extended its lead over California to 
1,160-858. UCLA is third at 782 points, followed by Arizona State with 700. USC 
is fifth with 569. 
</P>
<P>
After Stanford won the 200-yard medley relay, freshmen Janet Evans, Janel 
Jorgensen, and Lori Heisick led the Cardinal by winning three of the first four 
individual events. 
</P>
<P>
Evans caught teammate Michelle Griglione at the 150-yard mark of the 400-yard 
individual medley and went on to win in a meet record of 4:15.26. Lorenza Munoz 
of California was second, and Griglione was third. All three were under the 
NCAA qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Evans trailed in the beginning, she never worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I've swum so many 400 I.M.'s against Michelle I wasn't worried," said Evans, 
who won three gold medals at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen joined Connors and Evans as double winners when she won the 100-yard 
butterfly. Jorgensen, who was on the 1988 Olympic team with Evans, led from the 
beginning, finishing well under the qualifying mark with a time of 54.33. 
Kristin Stoudt of UCLA was second and Terri O'Loughlin of USC was third. 
</P>
<P>
Cal junior Sarah Anderson stopped Stanford's winning streak with a victory in 
the 200-yard freestyle. Andersen, who caught and passed Jeanne Gibbons of UCLA 
at the halfway point, set a meet record with a time of 1:47.83. Gibbons held on 
for second place, followed by Anna Hansen of USC. The top two qualified for the 
NCAA championships, which will be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Heisick concluded the Stanford freshman triple by winning the 100-yard 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
In the final individual event of the session, Kristin Kuhlman of California 
swam away from the field with an NCAA qualifying time of 56.87. Sherri White of 
USC was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford ended the night with a victory in the 800-yard freestyle relay. The 
Cardinal foursome of Jody Smith, Evans, Karen Kraemer, and Jorgensen swam a 
national leading time of 7:18.79. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and USC continued to swim well, despite Stanford's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up three more qualifiers today and a relay that will seed us very 
high at NCAAs," Bruin Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "Point-wise we're not getting 
better, but more people are swimming faster." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans did not add any more qualifiers, but Coach Darrell Fick was 
impressed with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unshaved swimmers are swimming their best unshaved times of the season, 
and I think we are a couple of tenths (of a second) away from an exceptional 
meet," Fick said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pac-10 diving championships, being held at USC, Stanford senior Katie 
Connors defeated Arizona State's Janae Lautenschlager, 481.95-472.10, in the 
women's three-meter springboard. USC's Brian Earley defeated UCLA's Chris 
Dudka, 547.00-499.05, to win the men's one-meter springboard title.

<TEXT>     "Wherever I end up (training) next year, I'm going to be working more on
I.M., and I feel like I'll get better," said Evans, who is leaving Stanford to
concentrate on the 1992 Olympic Games.;    Evans' 4-minute, 44.07-second
victory was far off her 4:37.76 record swim at the 1988 Olympics, but it was
comfortably ahead of the disappointing 4:46.05 she swam to finish fourth in
the January world championships.;    "My breaststroke is becoming my worst,
rather than my fly," said Evans, who trailed high school star Kristine Quance
by more than two seconds after the breaststroke leg. "In the I.M., they say
you either have it all, or if one stroke is just a little off, you'll lose."; 
  Part of Evans' reason for leaving Stanford, in addition to restricted
training rules being instituted by the NCAA, is dissatisfaction with her
training under Coach Richard Quick.;    She gave further insight into that
issue after the I.M. when she said her college training has focused too much
on freestyle.;    "I feel like I haven't trained much I.M.," she said. "I have
not worked enough on fly and breast, but I was pleased with tonight because I
held the end of a long taper," Evans said.;    Evans' I.M. performances had
fallen so much that Cardinal teammate Summer Sanders beat Evans in the I.M. at
the worlds (Sanders was third) and the NCAA championships, where they finished
1-2.;    Sanders, whose time at the world meet qualified her for the national
team at the next big international meet, the Pan Pacific Championships in
August, skipped Friday's race.;    "I hate it," said Sanders, a sprinter. "It
hurts more than any race I do.";    It hurt Quance, too, but her finish in
4:47.67 was still the sixth fastest by a U.S. woman.;    "It's probably the
most pain I've ever felt in a 400 I.M.," said Quance, who beat Evans by nearly
four seconds in Thursday morning's preliminaries. "It's the first time on a
400 I.M. I really pushed on every stroke, and it was my fastest time by five
seconds.";    Quance, of Northridge, finished second in Thursday's 200
breaststroke to 14-year-old Anita Nall, who won in U.S. record time, and both
qualified in that event for the Pan Pacific meet.;    Santa Clara Swim Club
was second to Texas Aquatics in the women's 400 free relay and fourth in the
men's 400 free relay.  </TEXT>

A FALSE START FORCES JAGER OUT AS BIONDI WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympian Matt Biondi and a depleted field of challengers left the starting 
blocks for the 50-meter freestyle Friday night to a chorus of boos -- a first 
for Biondi after all his years of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the standing-room-only crowd of 2,500 attending the Phillips 66/U.S. 
Swimming Long Course National Championships at USC were expressing their 
disappointment because the meet's premier event was altered when Tom Jager was 
disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, swimming in his first major meet since winning seven medals in the 1988 
Olympic Games, was disappointed, too. After winning the national title in the 
50, Biondi said: "I've never felt so empty about a victory. I think I felt the 
same way most of the people felt. 
</P>
<P>
"When the race was over, I think there were about four people clapping. 
Everybody else was sitting there thinking, 'We got robbed.' This was not what I 
came here for." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi came here to swim against Jager, the one swimmer who has beaten him 
often at this distance. 
</P>
<P>
He came to revitalize their rivalry. He and Jager -- the silver medalist at 
Seoul -- have been trying to attract attention to their sport, and they finally 
had drummed up interest. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were on their feet and cheering when the swimmers walked onto the 
deck, but silent for the start. Then, as the eight swimmers left the blocks, 
the starter beeped, signaling a false start. 
</P>
<P>
There were groans as the swimmers made their way back to the blocks. But the 
groans became shouts of protest when referee Annalise Eggert walked down the 
line behind the swimmers, passed Jager, and then turned around and came back to 
tab him as the one who was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
While Jager argued, the crowd broke into a chant: "Let him swim! Let him swim! 
Let him swim." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like that," Biondi said. "I thought we were going to 
have anarchy. It was obvious that everyone wanted him to be there. But these 
things happen in sport. We're all human. We can all make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Eggert might have made a mistake. A TV replay showed that if anyone went early, 
it was Steve Crocker, in Lane 5. Jager was in Lane 4. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker said he didn't go early. He believes he just had a wonderful start. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi suggested that swimming officials should consider using the instant 
replay as does the National Football League when a call comes into question. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who said he has not been disqualified for a false start in at least 12 
years, did nothing unusual on his start. And when Jager reviewed the videotape, 
he thought everyone was still. The rule states there can be no movement. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Jager spoke with reporters, he had cooled considerably. Jay 
Fitzgerald, coach of Jager's Santa Clara Swim Team, had stopped him in the 
hallway to suggest using restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Jager is a competitor who relies heavily on his psyche. This time, all that 
pent-up energy was initially unleashed in the direction of Eggert. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should apologize for some of the things I said," Jager said. "I was 
pretty keyed up. I'm not proud of the things I said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't take back anything about the way they've got to learn to start 
the race. They have eight big guys up there about to make a decision by 
hundredths of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Jager said that he didn't expect to be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"She passed me up and I didn't really think about it, but when she started 
coming back, everyone had to be scared. She was just as scared as anyone. . . . 
Once she made a decision, more than anything, she didn't want to back down from 
her original decision." 
</P>
<P>
On the restart, Todd Pace was disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
The six swimmers left were cautious during the third start. Still, Biondi was 
pleased with his winning time of 22.36 seconds -- not bad considering that he 
had started serious training only six weeks ago, after leaving the national 
water polo team. The time was a pool record, but it fell short of his 
22.14-second swim in Seoul, which broke Jager's world record and earned the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker was second in 22.47. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Biondi nor Jager will represent the United States in the 50 at the Pan 
Pacific Games. Biondi has scheduling conflicts and will not attend. And now 
Jager isn't qualified to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Jager will, however, swim the 50 in the preliminary heats in Tokyo in what the 
swimmers call their "money swim." If he doesn't keep himself ranked in the top 
six in the world, he loses training money. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't break the world record," Biondi told him. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. There will be other high-profile matchups of the world's best 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
As Biondi reminded everyone: "We have a special event here, probably the most 
exciting event in swimming. Tom and I have one of the best rivalries in all 
sports. Anything can happen on any day." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, nothing happens, as was the case in the national final. And 
heavyweight boxing fans thought they got robbed when the last Mike Tyson fight 
was called after 93 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jager returned later in the evening to anchor the men's 400-meter medley relay 
for Santa Clara, which was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn Aquatics ran away with team honors, winning both the men's and women's 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The men's high-point winner was Dave Wharton of USC and Team Foxcatcher. 
Wharton added the men's 200-meter individual medley title Friday night to 
finish ahead of Dan Jorgensen of USC and the Blue Fins Swim Club. Dan was more 
than 11 seconds behind his brother, Lars, in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans of the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team won her fourth national title 
of the meet and broke the pool record that Tiffany Cohen set during the 1984 
Olympic Games, taking the women's 800-meter freestyle in 8:22.11. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds the world record of 8:17.12, a mark she set early in 1988 before 
winning the gold medal in the event.

QUANCE MOVES A BIG STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING OLYMPIC DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGER'S EFFORT IN LONG COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS LANDED HER 
ON A NATIONAL TEAM THIS SUMMER AND SHOULD EARN HER A BERTH IN THE '92 OLYMPIC 
TRIALS AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Until last week, Kristine Quance's Olympic goal was a secret, something she 
pondered on long, silent swims to avoid being mesmerized by the black line on 
the bottom of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
But Quance, 15, from Northridge, let the cat out of the bag last Sunday and 
Monday at the U. S. Swimming National Long Course Championships in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Although the qualifying times will not be released until the U.S. Swimming 
convention Sept. 16-23 in Pittsburgh, Quance's efforts in the 400-meter 
individual medley (4 minutes 49.52 seconds) and the 200 breaststroke (2:33.52) 
are expected to be well under the qualifying standards for the Olympic Trials 
in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, her third-place finishes in those races put her within striking 
distance of the first- or second-place performance she'll need to make the U.S. 
team that will travel to Barcelona, Spain, to compete in the Games of the XXVth 
Olympiad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kinda been in the back of my mind, but I've never told anyone," Quance 
said of her Olympic aspirations. "I still don't want to tell anyone. I don't 
want to be bragging about the Olympics, but it's a little more realistic now." 
</P>
<P>
Quance made it more realistic with a drastic improvement during the past 12 
months. Her 400 IM time was seven seconds better than her previous best and a 
whopping 15 seconds faster than her best time of a year ago. In the 200 
breaststroke, her clocking was three seconds faster than what she swam unshaved 
and unrested at the Olympic Sports Festival in Minneapolis last month, and 
seven seconds quicker than her 1989 best. 
</P>
<P>
"At her first nationals last summer at USC we weren't expecting her to make it 
and she had an awkward time," said Steve Reardon, her coach with the Valley 
Aquatic Swim Team. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second one in Nashville last March she did her best times in the 
morning (preliminaries) but she didn't come back (well) at night (in the 
finals). It was a sign that she was too excited by her morning swims. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, she had great races in the morning and she came back and made some 
adjustments and swam even better times at night. She feels like she belongs at 
this level now." 
</P>
<P>
Already Quance has earned a berth at yet another level. This weekend, she will 
make her international debut in the Legion of European Nations Cup in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty excited about going to Italy," Quance said. "I've never been 
anywhere with U.S. Swimming except Canada and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I like traveling with swimming, I really don't have a problem getting 
homesick. It's really exciting, but it can get tiring because of the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the intimidation. Quance is still in awe of Olympian Janet Evans 
as well as Summer Sanders and Mary Ellen Blanchard, among others. But the 
difference between her first national championship meet last summer and her 
last is that now she can race with the best in the U.S. in the individual 
medley and the breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I kinda still do idolize them because they are so awesome, and when I first 
started going to nationals they were so much more awesome, " Quance said. "But 
now I'm getting closer and closer. I didn't really expect to place here and it 
still hasn't sunk in." 
</P>
<P>
While Quance's inexperience was painfully obvious in the 200 breaststroke, her 
talent was equally apparent. She reached the first wall ahead of the field, 
established a personal best at the 100 by turning in 1:13.00 and maintained the 
lead through 150 meters. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the more experienced Blanchard (granddaughter of Heisman trophy 
winner Doc Blanchard) and Jill Johnson passed her and Quance held on for third. 
</P>
<P>
In the individual medley, she picked up time on all four strokes, but still 
suffers from a weak backstroke leg. 
</P>
<P>
"Her backstroke is something we've worked on from Nashville (last March) until 
now," Reardon said. "It has helped her cause. She still falls behind the 
leaders, but in Nashville, she fell behind the whole field." 
</P>
<P>
On her best leg, the breaststroke, Quance makes up for lost time, but that 
takes its toll on the final freestyle portion. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes her 25 meters to recover because she goes so hard on the 
breaststroke," Reardon said. "But all those things will work out. I guarantee 
her next nationals she'll be more competitive on the backstroke and the 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she has a taste of what it's like to be in a race like that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ed Spencer, coach of the Industry Hills Aquatic Club, it's that 
ability to race that sets her apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes athletes only do about two-thirds of what they need to do," Spencer 
said. "Some of them work hard in the pool, but up on the blocks they are not at 
all cut out for the perfect race. 
</P>
<P>
"Others are great racers, but they are not willing to pay the price in 
workouts. Kristine is going all out in workouts and weight training on her own, 
and when she gets up on the blocks, she's all business." 
</P>
<P>
Though Quance, who began swimming at age 10, has reached the age when 
boy-watching and shopping with friends compete with the early hours, cold 
temperatures and monotony of her sensory-deprivation sport, Reardon believes 
she can withstand distractions. 
</P>
<P>
For now. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't been swimming that long so everything is really fresh and new to 
her," he said. "And she's having too much fun doing what she's doing, 
especially coming to a meet like this and getting third. 
</P>
<P>
"After Nashville, she said she didn't want fifth and sixth any more, and now 
she doesn't want third. She's constantly upgrading her goals." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the risk, it appears, of someone finding out.Associated Press

RAPID RISE SURPRISES MISSION VIEJO'S ERIC DIEHL

<P>
The rise of Eric Diehl has begun. He has gone from promising young swimmer to 
one with a national reputation, all in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the next step is close at hand. In a month, Diehl will compete at the 
Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing there would give him a foothold on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has happened so fast, it's kind of caught me by surprise," said 
Diehl, who will be a senior at Mission Viejo High School this fall. "But I want 
to compete in the Olympics. That's my long, long term goal. I need to get more 
experience against elite swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl figures to get plenty of that in the next several weeks. Besides the 
Goodwill Games, he will swim in the Swim Meet of Champions, which begins 
Thursday at the Marguerite Recreation Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which continues through Sunday, will feature several top American 
swimmers, including Janet Evans, plus members of the East German national team. 
</P>
<P>
It will give Diehl a chance to test how far he's come since winning the 
1,000-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to swim fast, but all my focus is on next month," Diehl said. "But this 
meet will give me another chance to see where I stand. It will give me an idea 
of how well I will swim at the Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl, who swims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores, will compete in the 800-meter 
freestyle in Seattle. He qualified for the games by winning the 1,000 freestyle 
at the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 8 minutes 58.26 seconds was a personal best and made him the only 
swimmer to finish under nine minutes in the event at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised by my performance," Diehl said. "I expected to do 
well, especially in that event. But I expected the college swimmers to be much 
faster. I really thought I was a long shot to win." 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that Diehl will win Thursday in the 800 freestyle. First, he 
hasn't tapered his training for the meet. Second, he'll be facing stiff 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Artur Wojdat, who also swims for the Nadadores, and Sebastian Wiese of East 
Germany also are entered in the event. Wojdat, who competes for the University 
of Iowa, was a member of Poland's Olympic team in 1988 and Wiese is ranked 
fifth in the world in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"The meet will be faster this year," Diehl said. "Especially the 800. With 
Artur alone, it will be faster. But there are a lot more quality swimmers in 
that event this year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 800, Diehl also will compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 1,500 
freestyles. It will be his last meet before tapering for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Diehl's summer of competition will not end in Seattle. After the Goodwill 
Games, he will go to Austin, Texas, for the U.S. Swimming Long Course Senior 
Nationals, which also will be the qualifying meet for the United States' World 
Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl will compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong showing at the nationals could only enhance Diehl's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see how I do at the Goodwill Games," Diehl said. "Then I'll know how 
successful my year has been." 
</P>
<P>
Swim Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
The only events Thursday will be the men's and women's 800 freestyle. The 
finals are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. . . . A group of 18 East German 
swimmers will compete, nine men and nine women. Besides Wiese, who also is 
ranked seventh in the world in the 1,500, the team includes Sabina Schulze, who 
is ranked seventh in the 200 freestyle and 10th in the 100 freestyle, and 
Christiane Sievert, who is ranked eighth in the 100 butterfly . . . The United 
States' top two women distance swimmers, Evans and Jane Skillman, will be 
matched against each other Thursday in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>

he has won and all the world records he has set, people expect something

BIONDI KNOWS YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL
SOVIETS FINISH 1-2-3 IN MEN'S 50 FREESTYLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Well, for the second day in a row Saturday, Biondi showed he is mortal,
finishing fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the Santa Clara International
Invitational Swim Meet before an estimated 4,000 fans at the Santa Clara
International Swim Center.;    Biondi, the former world-record holder and 1988
Olympic champion in the event, finished in 23.47 seconds, behind the Soviet
trio of Alexander Popov (22.78), Gennadi Prigoda (22.82) and Vladimir
Tkachenko (23.18).;    Popov's time set a meet record, one of three individual
meet records set. The others were by Stanford's Janel Jorgenson in the women's
100 butterfly (1 minute, 2.38 seconds) and Soviet Elena Rudkovskya in the
women's 100 breaststroke (1:10.30).;    The Soviets, who won four of 10 events
Friday, won six of 10 events Saturday. Their men's 400 relay team set a meet
record of 3:24.09.;    The main reason for the Soviet domination is that their
swimmers are in top racing form after peaking for their national championships
three weeks ago.;    The top U.S. swimmers, such as Biondi, are unshaven and
won't begin tapering their practice workouts until next month when they train
for the Pan Pacific Championships Aug. 22-26 in Canada.;    Tapering is the
process in training in which swimmers cut their workout load so they can peak
at major competitions.;    "It's a big advantage for them," Biondi said.
"They've got stronger, fresher legs, and they can hold tempo. It means
everything.";    Still, Biondi added, he feels as if he has to win every race
to live up to fans' expectations. On Friday, he finished sixth in the 100
butterfly.;    "It's hard," he said. "I get a nice introduction, and people
expect me to win big. I don't want to let them down. But if I win today, I'm
not doing my job for tomorrow.";    Biondi, who swims the 100 freestyle today,
wants to remind people that in 1988, he finished second in the 50 and 100
freestyles at this meet before winning those events at the Olympics.;    And
considering his training stage, Biondi said, he wasn't unhappy with his times
Friday and Saturday. Today, he'll be looking for another good time, regardless
of where he finishes.;    "I wouldn't be surprised if I lost," he said. "The
key is to have a good time and a good swim.";      ETC.: Preliminaries for
today's events begin at 9:30 a.m., with finals set for 4 p.m.  </TEXT>

AUSTRALIAN HAD HIS TIMING DOWN, BUT HIS RECORD BID IS UP IN THE AIR 
</P>

After 100 meters in a preliminary heat of the 1,500-meter freestyle at the 
Australian Commonwealth Games trials last week, Glen Housman knew something 
special was happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in front of a world-record pace and thought, what the heck, let's 
go for it," Housman told the Sydney Morning Herald. "I just put my head down 
and kept swimming and swimming." 
</P>
<P>
When the race was over, Housman's time was 14 minutes 53.59 seconds, which was 
1.17 seconds under Soviet swimmer Vladimir Salnikov's world record of 14:54.76. 
However, Housman's finishing touch did not stop the electronic timing system, 
so his time was not recognized by FINA, the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Most timing systems at big meets are equipped with a backup electronic timing 
device that starts with the gun and is stopped by the timers at the end of the 
race; however, this meet had no electronic backup. Housman's time was 
determined by taking the middle time of the three timers' hand-held 
stopwatches. The times were 14:53.57, 14:53.59 and 14:53.60. 
</P>
<P>
Because the times on the watches were so close and the time was considerably 
under the existing mark, the Australian Institute of Sport filed a petition 
with FINA to have the record allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We will undertake every possible action to see that the record is acknowledged 
by the world governing body," Craig McLatchey, executive director of the 
Australian institute, told the Sydney newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the FINA technical committee, Roger Smith, was the meet director, 
and he will endorse the petition. "I have been officiating swimming carnivals 
for the past 30 years and I have never struck this kind of thing before," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Housman, 18, became the second swimmer to go under 15 minutes in the 1,500. 
Salnikov, who won the 1,500 in the 1980 and 1988 Olympics, has been under 15 
minutes four times. Several swimmers have been close, including George Dicarlo, 
who holds the American record of 15:01.51. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of this year's U.S. Open, held earlier this month at the 
Justice Aquatic Center in Orlando Fla., was the return of Troy Dalbey. Swimming 
for the first time since last year's Seoul Olympics, Dalbey won the 100-meter 
freestyle and was second in the 200-meter freestyle, with times close to what 
he swam to make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey, a double gold-medalist in 1988, was banned from competing in United 
States Swimming-sanctioned meets for a year after he was caught taking a statue 
from a bar in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had been away from competitive swimming for so long, Dalbey was 
unsure of how he would perform in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important meet for me, as far as my confidence went," Dalbey said. 
"If I didn't do well there, I wasn't sure I'd ever have enough confidence to 
win again." 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey has also returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 NCAA meet, as a freshman at Florida, Dalbey was runner-up to Matt 
Biondi in the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyles. His time in the 200 made him 
the second-fastest performer in that event. 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey took the next year off to train for the Olympics. When he returned, he 
decided that he did not want to re-enroll at Florida. Instead, he enrolled at 
BYU. After living in Provo, Utah, for two months, he decided that the area was 
not to his liking. His next stop was Arizona State, where he is now. 
</P>
<P>
He did little training initially but has been in the water regularly this 
semester. Ron Johnson, the Sun Devil coach, is glad to have Dalbey on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the type of swimmer who can make a program by himself," Johnson said. 
"He can swim anything but is especially good in the middle-distance freestyles 
and on the relays." 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, Dalbey could not compete for ASU this semester. Starting with 
next semester, he has 1 1/2 years of eligibility left. Dalbey lost a year 
because Florida would not release him from his scholarship. ASU is petitioning 
the NCAA to have one year of eligibility restored on the basis of an NCAA rule 
that states if an athlete takes a year out of school to train for the Olympics 
and makes the team, the year does not count against him. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Dalbey is having fun swimming again. He plans to help ASU do as 
well as it can and keep swimming toward the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Mark Spitz announced that he was returning to swimming and aiming 
for a spot on the 1992 Olympic team in the 100-meter butterfly. Because Spitz 
is interested in just the one event, and possibly a relay, he enlisted the help 
of UCLA men's Coach Ron Ballatore, one of the top sprint coaches in America. 
</P>
<P>
After five months, Spitz says he is progressing well, training five days a week 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing fine. The big thing is not to get into (training) too quickly," 
Spitz said. "I've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Spitz last raced was in 1972 at the Montreal Olympics, where he won four 
individual events and was on three winning relay teams. Spitz chose the 
100-meter butterfly because it was his best event. His world record in 
Montreal, 54.27 seconds, stood until 1977, when Joe Bottom swam 54.18. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz expects to enter his first race sometime in the spring but won't be 
concerned with how he does. "In swimming, you don't really get your act 
together until the end of the season," Spitz said, "and since I'm shooting for 
1992, I've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Several Southland collegiate swimmers will compete in the Perth International 
Invitational meet at Perth, Australia, Jan. 5-7. Ray Looze and Brad Askins of 
USC, and Mark Dean of UCLA will represent the United States, and Erik Ran of 
USC will swim for the Netherlands. The American swimmers, 25 men and 18 women, 
will leave Dec. 27 and attend a training camp before the meet. A U.S. 
long-distance team will compete in a 25-kilometer race in the Swan River, which 
runs through Perth. 
</P>
<P>
USC sophomore Gary Anderson won the 200-meter individual medley, was second in 
the 200-meter backstroke and qualified for the Canadian team that will compete 
in the Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand, Jan. 24-Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest college swimming rankings, the Stanford women are first, just 
ahead of Texas. UCLA is ninth and USC eleventh. On the men's side, Texas is 
first, with USC second and Stanford third. UCLA is 10th.

JANET EVANS THRIVING AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
STANFORD, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Evans knew she was going to be asked, again, about the Olympics, and her 
eyes glazed over a little. After a long afternoon's workout at deGuerre Pool 
she would rather have talked about the here and now -- about Saturday's meet 
between Stanford and Texas, the No.-1 and No.-2 women's swimming teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm really psyched up for it," said Placentia's Evans, holder of three 
world records, three American records and three gold medals from the 1988 
Olympics. "If we do well against Texas, it'll help our mind-set for the NCAAs, 
something we're all looking forward to." 
</P>
<P>
Evans talked about her first year with the Cardinals -- she has won 16 of her 
22 races and finished no lower than third. Not coincidentally, she is 6-0 and 
has won 13 straight dual meets, dating back to the 1988 season. The team, rated 
No.-1 in women's swimming all year, is coming off lopsided 104-36 and 117-16 
wins over Arizona and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, 7-0 this season, are ranked second in the nation. They are led 
by Leigh Ann Fetter, Amy Shaw and Andrea Hayes, who will likely swim against 
Evans in the longer freestyle races. Handicapping the meet, Evans said, "We 
have to swim as fast as we can, and I think we'll be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But then the subject turned, out of her hands, toward the 1988 Olympics in 
Seoul, when Evans was the designated pixie of the press, America's Sweetheart, 
the high school senior from Placentia, Calif., who went from three gold medals 
to being Grand Marshal of both the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the 
Fiesta Bowl. Those were the days when TV mini-cams would chase her around the 
campus at El Dorado High to get quotes, remembered Evans, who opted to come to 
Stanford after being wooed by a dozen schools, including Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've come here I think the craziness has really died down," said Evans, 
18. "Sometimes someone will recognize me -- I can see them say to themselves, 
'Is that her?' -- but they leave me pretty much alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy training with the team," said Evans, adding that emotion for 
the dual meet against Texas is running high. "It's just as intense as it was at 
the Olympics, even more intense. The difference at the Olympics is you're just 
swimming by yourself -- here it's the whole team, you're all in it together." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 5-6, 110, has qualified for the NCAA finals in four events since coming 
to Stanford -- the 500, 1000 and 1650-yard freestyle and the 400 individual 
medley. She has improved from a time of 2:08.35 in the 200 fly on Jan. 6 to a 
time of 2:04.61 two weeks later, from a time of 2:03.53 in the 200 free in 
December to a time of 1:50.71 on Jan. 26, and from a time of 9:45.41 in the 
1000 freestyle Jan. 6 to a time of 9:32.63 against Arizona last weekend, only 
seven seconds off her American record. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Arizona I was swimming my best," said Evans, who practices up to five 
hours a day, a regimen she's maintained for six years. To keep from drowning in 
boredom on the endless laps, Evans will talk to herself, "sing a song, think 
about how much homework I've got to do when I get back ..." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way ever since junior high, she explained -- while her friends 
went to drive-ins and Friday night dances, she would be making another circle 
around the pool. "I used to think, 'Look at all the things they get to do,' but 
then look at the things I've been able to do that they haven't, so it kind of 
balanced out." 
</P>
<P>
Evans wasn't sure she was good enough to be a top swimmer until she went to the 
Goodwill Games in 1986 and barely missed making the world team. That's when she 
realized "I really enjoy competing, seeing the rewards of working hard," said 
Evans, adding, "For some reason I've always been better at distance. I've never 
been a sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she won gold medals at Seoul in the 400 individual medley, the 
800-meter freestyle and the 400-meter freestyle -- setting the world record -- 
that America sat up and took notice, and ever since then Evans has been trying 
to get things back to normal. "I'm surprised at how genuine she is," said 
swimming coach Richard Quick. "She doesn't have one bone of prima donna in 
her." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Evans signed a commitment to come to Stanford last May, Quick said, 
"Obviously, I feel we've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history ... the things that she has already accomplished are without precedent 
in United States swimming." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, he's even more impressed since Evans has come to Stanford, 
explained Quick. "I've never seen anybody so consistent in the hours she puts 
into practice. She puts more time into swimming than anyone I've ever heard of" 
</P>
<P>
Every serious swimmer puts in a lot of hours, said Evans, but it takes more 
than that. "A lot of it is in your head. You've got to have the confidence you 
can do it. I think 50 percent of it is in your head ... believing you can win."

<P>
It has long been said, only somewhat in jest, that the U.S. Olympic trials 
constitute the toughest swim meet in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Andy Coan. The world record-holder in the 100-meter freestyle in 1975, 
he did not qualify for the Olympic team in 1976. For that matter, he didn't 
make the eight-man field for the trials final. 
</P>
<P>
The limit on entries, two per event, and the depth of U.S. swimming conspire to 
make the U.S. trials more difficult than the Olympic Games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That is expected to change at the U.S. Swimming Convention in Pittsburgh next 
week when the 600-member House of Delegates votes to confirm March 1-6 as the 
dates for the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the U.S. team was selected only three or four weeks before the 
Olympic Games. The March dates, an adaptation of the Australian system, will 
give the team almost four months of training together before the 1992 Games in 
Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the old system, some coaches believed, was that to make the 
highly competitive U.S. team, swimmers were tapering -- easing up on their 
training and shaving their body hair -- for the trials, then repeating the 
process a few weeks later for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The second time, many believe, the taper doesn't take as effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes such a big effort just to make the team and then we were asking them 
to bounce back for the Games a month later," said Doug Ingram, date selection 
chairman. "It's tough to come off that emotional high from the trials that 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
But some coaches contend that the early selection process penalizes the "hot" 
swimmer, the one who peaks at the trials and continues to pick up speed through 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram believes that sacrifice will have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel what's best for the group outweighs the potential loss of an 
individual who comes on at the last minute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new system also has a major impact on collegiate swimming, since the trials 
will be held three to four weeks before the women's and men's NCAA Division I 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take some focus away from the NCAA championships, but what came across 
in our meetings with college and club coaches is that in an Olympic year they 
are willing to put aside their local concerns and put the focus on the national 
concern," said Ingram, who coaches the men's team at Southern Illinois 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The conference championship meets will be affected even more, since potential 
Olympians won't taper for them. Instead, they will train hard up to and during 
the conference meets so that they can taper before the Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some conferences, including the Pac-10 and the Southeastern, are 
considering moving their conference meets from March, 1992, to December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"That takes the pressure off an individual who might feel that he was letting 
his team down by focusing on the Olympic trials," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
The system will be tested in January. For the first time, the U.S. picked a 
national team several months in advance. The World Championships team was 
selected in early August and will compete Jan. 7-11 in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mission Bay swimming program appeared on the scene in 1985 by hiring 
away Mark Schubert from the Mission Viejo Nadadores, it appeared to be 
patterning itself after a Nadador program that had won 44 national team titles. 
The club, in Boca Raton, Fla., had the facilities, the funding and the coaching 
to attract swimmers from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years later, it lost Schubert to the University of Texas women's 
program and the affiliated Longhorn club. Now his successor, Steve Bultman, an 
assistant on the 1988 Olympic team, is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Mission Bay is probably the best training facility in the 
country, but I do think coaching changes have not had a stabilizing effect," 
Schubert said. "It is not on as solid a footing as it appeared to be at the 
beginning. The budget cuts have hurt. It never lived up to the dream it was 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Schubert's Longhorn club is up to 250 members, an increase of 40. More swimmers 
are expected with the recent addition of a satellite facility, a 50-meter pool 
in the Circle C section of Austin. 
</P>

Indianapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Fla., and Oklahoma City are vying to be the 
host of the 1992 Olympic trials, although late bids will be accepted before the 
voting at the U.S. Swimming convention Sept. 23 in Pittsburgh. . . . Voting 
will be held there for performance of the year. Tom Jager and Mike Barrowman, 
the only U.S. swimmers to set world records in 1990, appear to be the best 
bets. Jager, the former UCLA star, lowered the 50-meter freestyle mark twice on 
March 24 in Nashville with a final clocking of 21.81 seconds. Barrowman 
bettered the mark he set in August 1989 in Tokyo by a whopping 1.36 seconds, 
the most improvement of the 200 breaststroke record since 1976. . . . Finalists 
for swimmer of the year are Barrowman, Jager, Matt Biondi , Janet Evans, Melvin 
Stewart, Eric Namesnik, Leigh Ann Fetter and Nicole Haislett. Jon Urbanchek of 
the University of Michigan, formerly coach at Cal State Long Beach, was named 
coach of the year by the American Swimming Coaches Assn. at itsconvention last 
week in Washington. Urbanchek is credited with having developed Barrowman. . . 
. Olympic gold medalist Mark Spitz is at the Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., for tests at the International Center for Aquatic 
Research. Spitz plans to swim in the flume, the only swimming treadmill in the 
Western Hemisphere. His stroke efficiency and swimming economy, a gauge of how 
efficiently he uses oxygen, will be measured and compared to future tests. . . 
. On Saturday, Spitz and members of Indiana's six NCAA championship teams, 1968 
through '73, will meet in Bloomington, Ind., for a reunion.

<LEADPARA>  She has seen the 3-year-old videotape so many times she's almost sick of it.
For a while, every time company came over to her house in Roseville, her
father would pop it in the VCR and she would have to relive the race again.;  
 "The more I saw it, the more I thought it was so close," said Summer Sanders,
who's finishing her freshman year at Stanford with three Goodwill Games, one
world championship and three NCAA swimming titles since this time last year.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SANDERS LOOKS AHEAD TO OLYMPICS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Then here these people are in the Olympics, and I think I should have been
there.";    She could have been there, swimming for the United States in
Seoul, South Korea, in 1988, but at the Olympic trials that spring she
finished third in the 200-meter individual medley -- one place from the
Olympic team but captured for posterity on Dad's videotape.;    Fifty meters
from the finish, turning from breaststroke to freestyle for the final time
down the pool, 15-year-old Summer Sanders had been first.;    "I turned my
breast-free turn and took a breath my first stroke and looked and there was
just nobody there," Sanders said. "They all hadn't made their turns yet. I
knew I was up with the leaders, but I didn't know I was ahead. I thought, oh,
my gosh. I had an Olympic gold medalist in the 200 freestyle (Mary Wayte)
right beside me, and when people are 15-year-olds, you know . . .";    Yes, we
know. Fifteen-year-olds either have no idea of the significance of what
they're about to accomplish, and they shock the world and themselves, or they
understand and psych themselves out.;    Sanders knew. Sanders faded.;    Yet,
in those three years, other things have faded as well. Mostly her anonymity.; 
  "She is an odds-on favorite to make the 1992 U.S. Olympic team," Coach
Richard Quick said when he signed her for Stanford.;    As superstitious as
she is, Sanders wishes he had never said those words, but she beat the world
in the 200 butterfly -- her favorite event -- in January, was second in the
200 I.M. and third in the 400 I.M.;    She has rested this week at the U.S.
Swimming Spring Nationals, dodging those events to win the 100 butterfly and
swim for her old club, California Capital, in the 400 medley relay.;    She'll
take the next week or two off and then begin training for the Olympic trials a
year from now in Indianapolis.;    "The Olympics are my ultimate goal," she
said. "That's the highest step you can make in amateur athletics.;    "When I
look back (at the '88 trials), I'm not really disappointed. If I had been to
the Olympics, what would my goals have been after that? Would my confidence
still be up?";    Perhaps not, because Sanders, while willing to put in the
work, is not someone such as former Stanford teammate Janet Evans, who lives
to marinate in chlorine.;    She hates the pain of the 400 I.M., her longest
event, and even 200s bother her.;    "My goal is by my senior year to be down
to 50s and 100s," she said. "When you have a bad 400, it's really bad. There's
four minutes of hell in there that just doesn't go by quick. A hundred is only
a minute. That's not so bad.";    Plus, if she screws up, the videotape is
short, too.  </TEXT>

Janet Evans, a triple gold-medal winner in the Seoul Olympics, scored two 
victories Friday as the United States continued to dominate the Pan Pacific 
Swimming Championships at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Evans won the women's 400-meter individual medley in meet-record time, then 
pushed the 800-meter freestyle relay team to a meet-record victory. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, the U.S. team won six of nine events in the 
50-meter Yoyogi National Olympic swimming pool. Australia, China and Canada 
each won one race. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400-meter individual medley, Evans took the lead after 100 meters and 
easily won in 4 minutes 39.38 seconds for her 20th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, representing the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team, finished about 10 meters 
ahead of China's Lin Li, who was timed in 4:45.69. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Evans teamed with Mitzi Kremer, Stacy Cassiday and Julie 
Kole to win the relay in 8:03.33, more than three seconds better than the 
former meet mark. Japan was second in 8:14.83, followed by Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really satisfied with my strokes today," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
American Richard Korhammer was a winner for the second time in two days, taking 
the 100-meter breaststroke in 1:02.95. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gjertsen, who won the 200-meter freestyle Thursday, swam with the 
victorious U.S. 800-meter freestyle relay team, which was timed in 7:20.87. 
</P>
<P>
American Brent Lang won the 100-meter freestyle in 49.56 seconds, narrowly 
beating Australian Andrew Baildon, who was clocked in 50.03. Gjertsen finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Yong Zhuan gave China its first victory, taking the women's 100-meter freestyle 
in 55.68, which broke the meet mark of 55.86 set by Dara Torres of the United 
States in 1987. Jenny Thompson of the United States, was second in 55.84. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Michael McKenzie won the 800-meter freestyle in 7:58.99, edging 
American Dan Jorgensen, who was clocked in 8:01.29. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Ferguson of Boca Raton, Fla., and Wendy Lucero of Aurora, Colo., completed 
sweeps of the springboard events in the U.S. Outdoor Diving Championships at 
Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson scored 671.82 points to win the men's three-meter final after taking 
the one-meter event Thursday. Second-place Mark Bradshaw, who had the lead 
after three rounds, finished with 636.96 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero won consecutive titles by scoring 472.05 in the morning's one-meter 
finals and returning seven hours later to win the three-meter event with 
502.77. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-time U.S. champion Kelly McCormick of Columbus, Ohio, finished second to 
Lucero in the three-meter final with 468.15 points.

one-third of the 100-meter backstroke under water.;    He won the silver

<TEXT>     The next year Berkoff retired, and the world governing body of swimming,
FINA, limited underwater starts to the race's first 10 meters.;    Not only
has FINA tinkered with the backstroke rules twice since '89, Berkoff has
un-retired to win Saturday's race at the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals using
a new turn he has developed.;    "I've got some tough decisions to make this
summer to see if I want to try and make the (Olympic) team in '92," said
Berkoff, whose winning time was 55.57. "The new rules for the backstroke I can
live with. I think I can break the world record. I think there are some other
guys who can break the world record.";    One is Martin Zubero of Spain, a
University of Florida swimmer who was barred from the championship finals
because of his nationality. He won the consolation finals in a time faster
than Berkoff's, 55.35. Zubero stands to win a reported $1 million from the
Spanish government if he wins the 100 backstroke next summer in Barcelona.;   
Berkoff, a Harvard graduate, said his turn is just part of his ongoing battle
to stay ahead of the rules makers.;    "I feel like an outlaw sometimes," he
said. "After the Olympics, I hid in my corner and pouted for a while. (With
the underwater start), the important part of the race was the first half. Now
we're looking at the back half of the race.";    In the women's 100
backstroke, Janie Wagstaff, 17, of Kansas City, Mo., chopped the U.S. record
down to 1 minute, 1.10 seconds in the morning preliminaries and then returned
to win the final in 1:01.22.;    Janet Evans easily won the 400 freestyle in
4:09.11, well off her 1988 world record of 4:03.85.;    Summer Sanders of
Stanford nipped teammate Janel Jorgensen in the 100 butterfly in 1:00.47.
Jorgensen was 0.01 seconds behind.  </TEXT>

TERRY'S RECORD LIST GROWS BY TWO

<P>
The events and the years change, but the results are always the same for 
USDHS's Alison Terry. In every individual event she has entered in the San 
Diego Section swimming finals, she has not only won but set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a junior, went into Saturday's swimming and diving championships at Mt. 
Carmel High having already set section marks in four events, two as a freshman 
and two as a sophomore. This year, Terry set her sights on two new events -- 
the 200-yard individual medley and 100 butterfly -- and broke the records in 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
Terry's was not the only repeat performance -- the Poway boys and girls swam 
away with team championships for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Poway had four individual boys' winners and scored 322 points to second-place 
Mt. Carmel's 205. The girls won the first event of the day, the 200 medley 
relay, and had 11 entries in the individual finals. None of its swimmers 
finished higher than second, but all of them either held or improved qualifying 
positions as the Titans defeated Rancho Buena Vista, 254-199. 
</P>
<P>
Terry swam the 200-yard IM in 2 minutes 5.71 seconds, bettering the 2:06.02 set 
by Hilltop's Tami Bruce in 1985. Later, Terry swam the 100 butterfly in 57.24, 
more than two seconds faster than any of her opponents, to bring down the 
longest-standing girls' mark of 57.52 set by Point Loma's Leslie Mendez in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman in 1988, Terry set marks in the 50 freestyle (24.09) and the 100 
backstroke (58.55). Last year, she broke records in the 200 freestyle (1:49.62) 
and 100 freestyle (50.56). She now owns section records in six of the eight 
girls' individual events. About the only question that remains: Will Terry come 
back as a senior and attack the 500 freestyle and 100 breaststroke? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided yet," she said. "I already swam the 50 and 100 back faster 
than the record times. I hear there's a freshman coming to our school next year 
that does a 1:52 in the 200 free. If that's the case, I might do that. I like a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that would challenge Terry, who competed for the U.S. Junior National 
team at an event in East Germany during the winter, is the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a goal to be there in '92 (in Barcelona) or '96," she said. "No pain, 
no Spain. That's my slogan." 
</P>
<P>
Poway's boys got two victories each from Marc Fairon (1:58.03 in the 200 
individual medley and 59.0 in the 100 breaststroke) and Trevor Jamison (51.84 
in the 100 butterfly and 21.72 in the 50 freestyle). Of the 11 Poway swimmers 
to reach the finals, seven placed in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked tired the last couple of events," Poway Coach Dennis Moore said. 
"They're so competitive. I think a lot of our kids used most of their energy in 
the prelims (Wednesday and Thursday). They don't like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS's girls, who finished fourth with 151 points, won five finals. Leah 
Schraeder qualified third and sixth in the 50 and 100 freestyles, but won both. 
USDHS's 400 freestyle relay, anchored by Terry, qualified third but won in 
3:39.34. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alison Terry's time in the 200 individual medley qualified her for All-American 
honors from the National Interscholastic Swim Coaches of America. . . . Mira 
Mesa's Mike Picotte, who set section records in the 200 freestyle (1:38.44) and 
100 freestyle (45.21) last year, won both races again this year but was slower: 
1:40.47 and 45.64. . . . San Dieguito's Kari Lyderson claimed championships in 
the girls' 200 freestyle (1:51.5) and 500 freestyle (4:54.17).

What do you give a girl who has nearly everything? How about a teddy bear? 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans, world-class distance swimmer, treasures a stuffed animal as much 
as the three gold medals she won in the Seoul Olympics last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The teddy bear was a present from one of her teammates at El Dorado High 
School. But the entire team presented it to her at the Southern Section 3-A 
finals in May. 
</P>
<P>
"It was from my secret pal on the team," Evans said. "Everyone on the team has 
one, and we give each other little gifts before every meet. But this one was 
from everyone. They all signed a card and gave it to me. It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, The Times' Orange County girls' swimmer of the year, the gift marked 
the end of an illustrious high school career. 
</P>
<P>
While at El Dorado, Evans competed in four Southern Section championship meets. 
Including relays, she won 10 Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked the Southern Section meet," said Evans, who will attend 
Stanford on a swimming scholarship in the fall. "It was fun to compete with a 
team. I like being with my peers." 
</P>
<P>
Evans has had few of those in the pool, especially on the high school level. 
She holds national high school records in the 200-yard individual medley and 
500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 3-A meet, Evans broke her national high school record in the 200 
individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. She also won the 500 
freestyle in 4:38.34, missing her national mark by a second. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also helped El Dorado's 200 medley relay team finish first. The Golden 
Hawks finished second at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish is Evans' fondest memory of her high school 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really exciting," Evans said. "It was the highest El Dorado has ever 
finished. That was special. I'm glad I was a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, the high school season was a welcome break from the rigors of 
international competition. It was a chance to be with her friends and have a 
little fun. She regularly swam in events other than her specialties in dual 
meets, as well as swimming on relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to swim the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke during dual meets," 
Evans said. "I could never do that on the international level. I'm a distance 
swimmer; there's no way I could beat the best in the world in the 100-meter 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school swimming, I get to be with my friends. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
It may sound odd, but Evans has actually lost a high school race in the 
Southern Section championship meet. Of course, that was back in those 
pre-legend days when she was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing in the 200 individual medley in 1985, she has won every individual 
championship race. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's over already," Evans said. "High school went by so fast. 
It's hard to imagine not swimming in high school anymore. It's a little sad." 
</P>

STANFORD WINS 4TH CONSECUTIVE WOMEN'S TITLE

The Stanford women's swimming team won four more events Sunday night to seal 
their fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championship at 
the East Los Angeles College Pool. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford totaled 1,717 points. California finished second with 1,238, followed 
by UCLA (1,143), Arizona State (1,075) and USC (936). 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's first victory came in the first event when freshman Janet Evans 
lapped the field in the 1,650-yard freestyle, setting a conference record of 
15:53.77. 
</P>
<P>
Although victories are almost becoming routine for Evans, who had won two 
events in earlier sessions, she was excited by her effort. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to go under 16 minutes and I was very happy to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Susannah Miller, a Stanford senior, led a Cardinal sweep in the 200-yard 
backstroke. Miller, who touched with an NCAA qualifying time of 2:01.29, was 
followed by Jody Smith and Dede Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Stoudt, a sophomore at UCLA, won the 100-yard freestyle with a 
conference record of 49.93. Michelle Thompson of Arizona State was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stoudt, who won the 50-yard freestyle Friday night, swam her best time ever. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to break 50 seconds," Stoudt said. "I'm confident going to NCAA's 
because I know I can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the 200-yard breaststroke, Stanford freshman Lori Heisick 
led from the beginning on the way to her second championship with a time of 
2:15.82. Her teammates, Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert, were second and 
third, respectively. Heisick won the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's final victory came when freshman Janel Jorgensen joined Evans as a 
three-event winner with a victory in the 200-yard butterfly. Jorgensen's time 
of 1:58.75 was just off Mary T. Meagher's conference record of 1:57.4, but well 
under the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen was happy with the victory, but had hoped for Meagher's record. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the record, but I wasn't sure if I could get it tonight," 
Jorgensen said. "We'll see, with a couple of weeks of rest, whether I can get 
her other marks." 
</P>
<P>
Meagher also holds the American records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
events. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA added another championship by winning the 400-yard freestyle relay with a 
time of 3:23.29. Stanford was second and USC third. All three teams qualified 
for the NCAA championships to be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
For Stanford, the relay was merely icing on the cake. Stanford, the defending 
national champion, is top-ranked this year, and after this weekend's 
performances is in good position to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA and USC, the result of the relay was a great way to end the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great Pac-10's," UCLA Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "The last relay 
just topped it off." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pac-10 diving championships, Jill Campbell of California won the 
10-meter platform event, defeating Kristin Jensen of Stanford, 360.30-350.50, 
at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC. Katie Connor of Stanford, who won the 
one- and three-meter springboard championships, was third. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Earley of USC won the men's 10-meter platform with 543.80 points. The 
victory was Earley's second of the meet; he won the three-meter springboard 
Saturday. Chris Dudka of UCLA finished second.

L.A. INVITATIONAL SWIM MEET; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS, STEINSEIFER POOL TALENTS ON FINAL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The L.A. Invitational Swim Meet tied together the past and the present of 
American women's swimming Sunday and, in so doing, unwrapped what looks to be a 
bright future. 
</P>
<P>
The past: Carrie Steinseifer, who won a 1984 gold medal in the 100-meter 
freestyle but later quit swimming altogether, won the 100-meter butterfly 
Sunday as the four-day invitational ended. 
</P>
<P>
The present: Janet Evans, three-time gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics, won 
the 200-meter individual medley by four seconds after finishing second in the 
100-meter backstroke, an event she hadn't competed in since she was 10. 
</P>
<P>
The future: Steinseifer, 21, and Evans, 17, were among a handful of swimmers to 
qualify for U.S. Senior Nationals which will be held July 31-Aug. 4 right back 
at USC's Olympic Swim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months ago, it not only appeared that Steinseifer wouldn't qualify 
for nationals, but it also appeared that she didn't much care. She had quit 
swimming for eight months because she says the sport ceased being fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I left with the intention of never coming back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she did return, much to the dismay of those opponents she blew out of the 
water in the 100-meter butterfly Sunday with a 1:03.78. The only swimmer to 
stay close was top-qualifier Francie Oleary, who finished with a 1:04.07. 
Steinseifer also won the 100-meter freestyle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to see her hungry again," said Pierre LaFontaine, her coach. "I 
don't think she ever lost the taste for winning." 
</P>
<P>
Steinseifer began training again in April, putting her a little behind in 
training, but, as this weekend proved, a little ahead of her competition. She 
has flourished as a member of the Phoenician Swim Team, a group that refuses to 
keep quiet whenever she swims. 
</P>
<P>
"I just missed swimming," Steinseifer said. "It had provided a lot of 
excitement and happiness in my life. . . . I still think there are a lot of 
good swims left in this body." 
</P>
<P>
In other events Sunday, Andrea Cecchi of Italy, who set a meet record in the 
100-meter breast-stroke with a time of 1:04.45 in the preliminaries, was 
disqualified before the finals for failing to check in after the preliminaries. 
Richard Schroeder, who finished fourth in the event at the 1988 Olympics, won 
with a time of 1:04.84. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200-meter individual medley, Ray Looze set a meet record at 
2:07.10, and Joyce Lightfoot and Olympian Lars Jorgensen won the 1,500-meter 
freestyles.

EAST GERMANS MAY BE HEARING SWAN SONG; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: NOT ONLY IS THEIR SYSTEM CHANGING, BUT U.S. WOMEN APPEAR TO BE 
GAINING GROUND. 
</P>

<P>
It was a scene all too familiar to the opponents of East German women swimmers 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Having won the gold and bronze medals in a race, two East Germans stood on the 
victory stand Tuesday night during the Goodwill Games at the King County 
Aquatics Center and listened to their national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
As practiced early during their training in East Germany's elaborate system of 
sports schools, they stood at attention, forbidden to sing the words in public, 
appearing emotionless. But that is all it was, an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that when I heard the national anthem, it did make me feel sad," 
said Heike Friedrich, who finished third in the 200-meter freestyle, behind 
gold medalist teammate Manuella Stellmach and silver medalist Nicole Haislett 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it is one of the last times I will hear it. Even though there were 
things wrong with our system, there were things that worked for us." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was ultimately important, and many in the country argue today that 
it was not, one thing that worked extremely well was East Germany's sports 
system. In no sport did the so-called "Miracle Machine" achieve more success 
than in women's swimming. 
</P>
<P>
After emerging as a power in the 1974 World Championships, East German women 
won gold medals in 11 of 13 events at the 1976 Olympics. Twelve years later, 
after two Olympics tainted by boycotts, East German women won gold medals in 10 
of 15 events at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
In the Goodwill Games swimming competition, which ended Tuesday night, East 
German women won gold medals in only three of 17 events. Stellmach's victory in 
the 200 freestyle was their only individual gold. They won two relays, but, for 
the first time since 1978, they also lost one, finishing second to the U.S. 
Monday night in the 400-meter medley relay.

"The Goodwill Games is not the most important competition for us," Friedrich 
said. "We are goal-oriented toward the World Championships in January." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the next breath, Friedrich admitted that she fears the East Germans 
will not fare much better at the World Championships in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
That could be their last major international competition as a separate team, 
although, considering the speed with which East and West Germany are merging 
their political systems, it is possible that the Goodwill Games was the last. 
</P>
<P>
"The political changes have affected us," Friedrich said. "It will definitely 
be worse in the next six months. It will be worse than it has been in the last 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, 20, was a heroine in her country after she returned from Seoul, 
where she won a gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Berlin Wall began coming down, the veil of secrecy surrounding the 
sports system followed. Resentful when they learned of the privileges 
successful athletes received, many East Germans blamed the athletes. 
Friedrich's West German car reportedly was vandalized last December. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through a six-week trip to the United States to train and compete here, 
Friedrich's coach, Joachim Rother, learned that he had lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
His sports club in Chemnitz, known as Karl Marx Stadt until earlier this year, 
lost much of its funding and decided to retain only four swimming coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been gone for six weeks and wasn't there to defend his position," 
Friedrich said. "While he was gone, others grabbed up all of the spots." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting to be swallowed by the more financially stable West German system, East 
Germany's sports committee has withdrawn support from most of the sports 
schools and clubs. Only those that have managed to enlist corporate sponsors 
are thriving. East German coaches and athletes are faced with finding jobs 
outside athletics in order to support their training. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go home, we don't know if we will have any training opportunities at 
all," Stellmach said. "Up to now, training has been made available to anyone 
who qualified. Now we have to go out and find sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Their rivals from the United States have been taking it all in, although not so 
gleefully as might be expected considering the beatings they've taken in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Their coaches and swimmers are really worried about what will happen when they 
get back home," U.S. freestyler Stacy Cassiday said. "They're sort of in a 
panic. They call home almost every day to see what has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Considering their youth, talent and depth, the young Americans -- "The New Kids 
on the Block" -- might have been ready to overtake the East Germans regardless. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. women won 11 gold medals and nine silvers in 17 Goodwill Games events. 
Janet Evans, still only 18, won three gold medals and two silvers. In the 
200-meter butterfly Tuesday night, Summer Sanders, 17, won her third gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"The East Germans are down a little bit in this meet," U.S. women's Coach 
Richard Quick of Stanford said last weekend. "Anyone can understand why from a 
political point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know that it's over for the East Germans. They may not be called 
East Germans, but they'll be back. They're just great athletes."

HOMESTEAD'S TAYLORS READY TO MAKE BIG SPLASH IN
CCS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  High School Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Karli and Ryann not only have continued the family aquatics tradition at
Homestead, but they also are regarded as two of the finest swimmers in the
Central Coast Section.;   Karli, a senior, and Ryann, a freshman, will be
among the favorites in their events at the CCS Swimming and Diving
Championships this weekend at Stanford's deGuerre Pool.;   The swimming trials
begin Friday at 10:30 a.m. Diving competition starts Saturday at 9 a.m.,
followed by the swimming finals at 1 p.m.;   Karli won the 200-yard individual
medley and 100 backstroke titles at last year's section meet, and she is the
choice to repeat in those events.;   She also probably would have been the
favorite in the 100 freestyle, but swimmers are limited to two individual and
two relay events in the section finals.;   Ryann, who has been among this
year's top CCS swimmers in the 100 breaststroke, 500 freestyle and individual
medley, said she will swim the breaststroke at the CCS meet but hasn't decided
whether her other event will be the 500 free or 200 I.M.;   If she chooses the
200 I.M., she will compete against her sister.;   "I wouldn't mind beating
Karli," Ryann said. "But it would be difficult. She is much stronger in that
event than I am.";   Karli's fastest swim in the 200 I.M. is 2 minutes, 7
seconds, her winning time in last year's CCS meet. Ryann said her best is
2:10.29, in April at a U.S. Swimming meet.;   The sisters, both of whom
compete for the Santa Clara Swim Club, also will be part of Homestead's 200
medley and 400 free relay teams.;   Paul Taylor, the father of Robin, Karli,
Ryann and Kyle, a sophomore water polo player and swimmer at Homestead, said
the Taylor family is in its third generation of producing swimmers.;   "The
first two generations of Taylors swam for Redford High in Detroit," Paul
Taylor said. "One of my brothers is still competing in masters.;   "There has
yet to be a Taylor swim in college -- but it looks like Karli will be the
first.";   Karli said UCLA, Southern Cal and UC-Santa Barbara have expressed
interest in her. She said she will be making a recruiting visit to USC this
month.;   "That has been one of my goals, to swim in college," she said.;  
How long her swimming career lasts, however, may depend on how her shoulders
hold up.;   "My shoulders have been giving me problems," she said. "I have
loose (shoulder) joints and that causes pulling on the tendons.;   "Doctors
have told me that surgery would be the only way to correct the problem, but
that would mean I would be out for three to four months. So I swim with pain
and take medication to reduce the swelling.";   Karli also coaches the
Homestead team on Tuesdays, when head coach Theresa Hessler is unable to get
away from her job as a nurse at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.;   "I
kind of look at Karli as my assistant coach," Hessler said. "She is the
captain of the team and a leader with a strong personality. The girls respect
her, and I feel very comfortable about leaving her in charge when I'm not able
to be there.";   Karli said her goals at the CCS meet are to improve on her
200 I.M. time and eclipse the meet 100 backstroke record of 57.73 seconds, set
in 1977 by Linda Jezek of Homestead. Karli just missed Jezek's mark last year
while winning the event in a personal-best 57.80.;   "Linda owns the oldest
record in the CCS meet," Karli said, "and I want to break it.";   When the
high school season ends, Karli said, she will be concentrating on reaching the
Olympic trials in March in Indianapolis, Ind. Last August, she finished second
in the 200-meter backstroke and third in the 200-meter I.M. and 100-meter fly
in the Junior Olympics at Mission Viejo.;   "I feel I have a shot at making
the trials in the 200 back and possibly the 200 I.M. and 100 back," she said.;
  Karli credits her improvement over the last two years to Jay Fitzgerald, the
Santa Clara Swim Club coach.;   "He has really motivated me," she said. "He is
very demanding. He has made me tougher mentally and physically. He sets my
standards very high and makes me believe I can achieve them.";   Ryann, who
also credits Fitzgerald for making her a better swimmer, said she believes she
has a chance to win a title this weekend in the 100-yard breaststroke.;   "But
that pretty much is the same for everyone," she said. "There are a lot of fast
breaststrokers in the CCS.";   As for Ryann's future in the sport, Karli said,
"I can see her going far. I think she will score (finish among the top eight
swimmers) at senior nationals before she gets out of high school. And I think
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta are within her reach."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  After a sluggish first two days, the U.S. swim team got back on course
Wednesday when Matt Biondi and Janet Evans won gold medals at the World
Swimming Championships in Perth, Australia.;    Biondi retained his gold medal
by swimming the 100-meter freestyle in 49.18 seconds, well off his world
record of 48.42.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Evans, a triple gold-medalist in the 1988 Olympics, finally added a world
championship gold to her victory list, beating Australian Hayley Lewis with a
time of 4 minutes, 9.40 seconds in the 400 freestyle. She didn't threaten her
world-record time of 4:03.85.;    With the victory, Evans, a Stanford
sophomore, avenged a loss to Lewis in the 200 freestyle Tuesday. Earlier this
week, Evans finished a disappointing fourth in the 400 individual medley and
anchored the 800 freestyle relay team which was disqualified.;    The women's
400 freestyle relay team added another gold medal Wednesday with a victory
over Germany in 3:43.26.;    The U.S. also got a surprise gold medal in diving
when Kent Ferguson, a six-time national champion who hadn't won an important
international meet, won the 3-meter springboard.;    In water polo, the U.S.
men's team lost to Germany 9-7 and must beat Hungary today to stay in
contention for a medal.; FOOTBALL: Syracuse named assistant Paul Pasqualoni as
head coach, replacing Dick MacPherson, who Monday was named coach of the New
England Patriots. Pasqualoni, 41, served four seasons as linebackers coach.;
TENNIS: John McEnroe, thrown out of the Australian Open last year after
throwing a tantrum, is staying away this year  because of a shoulder injury. .
. . Boris Becker lost to Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 in his opening match
of an exhibition tournament in Adelaide, Australia.; GOLF: Arnold Palmer,
after an absence of 11 years, has committed to play in the 1991 Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, tournament officials announced. The tournament will be played
on the Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Poppy Hills courses Jan. 31-Feb. 3. . .
. Tom Watson said his resignation from the Kansas City Country Club to protest
its discriminatory membership has resulted in positive reaction nationwide.
Watson's resignation late last year from the private club where he learned to
play golf prompted the club to change its mind about the membership
application of Henry Bloch, co-founder of a large tax preparation firm. Bloch
is Jewish, as are Watson's wife and children.; MISCELLANY: Former Stanford
basketball star Jennifer Azzi has signed a one-year contract with an Italian
pro team, USA Today reported. Azzi, a 5-foot-9 guard who was last season's
women's collegiate player of the year, will play her first game for Viterbo on
Sunday. "I'm happy for her, but more importantly she's happy," said Tara
VanDerveer, Azzi's coach at Stanford. "She has a lot of basketball left in
her." . . . Pat Summerall, CBS-TV's top NFL play-by-play announcer, says a
combination of alcohol and pain killers almost caused him to bleed to death
last month. Summerall, 60, told The National he has changed his routine since
spending 10 days in a Florida hospital with upper gastro-intestinal bleeding.
. . . The U.S. Olympic soccer team recorded a 3-1 victory over FC Volendam, a
member of the Netherlands' first division.  </TEXT>
