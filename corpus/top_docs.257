<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill Creates ``The Experiment Nobody Wanted''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After decades of studying wildlife in an
unspoiled area of Antarctica, scientists have begun a new, unwelcome
line of research: the effects of an oil spill.
   ``This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted,'' said National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge.
   By Tuesday, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area
affected by the sinking of an oil-laden supply ship, which ran
aground Jan. 28 off the Antarctic Peninsula.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, said Ted DeLaca, chief scientist of the foundation's division
of polar programs.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, DeLaca told
reporters by telephone from Palmer Station, a research outpost near
the spill.
   ``All the principle (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Adelie penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the
first time in a few days, swimming into contaminated waters. Other
birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive
into it to feed.
   Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the
oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they
swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil-covered prey.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said Polly Penhale,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from the large seal population, about 30,000 sea birds live
there, including Adelie and chinstrap penguins, cormorants, kelp
gulls and giant petrels, she said.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, but now the pristine nature of the area has been altered.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said Talmadge. ``I think if you're a
scientist in the year 2035, you've got to remember there was an oil
spill.''
   DeLaca said the highly sensitive environment ``has been
compromised in a way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   Langdon Quetin, research biologist at the University of
California in Santa Barbara, said if the oil spill causes dramatic
damage or long-term effects on plants and animals, ``then we can't
really depend on the area as a natural uncontaminated laboratory.''
   ``That really is unfortunate, to say the least, because it is one
of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good logistics to,'' he
said. ``It will be the ruination of a good laboratory, at least in
the near future, at least as a natural uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other
organisms kept in tanks at Palmer Station, which marine botanist
Mike Neushul of the University of California at Santa Barbara calls
``probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.''
   The tanks draw water from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, Penhale said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is ``much more toxic than
crude oil'' because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
the Baja California coast some 30 years ago, said the effects of
that spill lasted 17 years.
   In addition, recovery in Antarctica may be prolonged because
bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down, said
Paul Dayton, professor of marine ecology at the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.

   Oil from a sunken ship off Antarctica threatens
not only the environment in a pristine bay, but also wildlife
research in a biologically rich area prized until now for its
unspoiled state, scientists say.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said National Science Foundation spokesman
Jack Talmadge. ``I think if you're a scientist in the year 2035,
you've got to remember there was an oil spill.''
   Ted DeLaca, chief scientist of the foundation's polar programs,
said the highly sensitive environment ``has been compromised in a
way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   While the spill's effect on future research cannot yet be
determined, ``it's something I find personally disturbing,'' he said
by telephone Friday from Palmer Station, a research outpost near the
spill.
   The oil is leaking from an Argentine research and supply ship
that ran aground Jan. 25. The ship is nearly submerged on shoals in
the Bismarck Strait just off the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles from
the tip of South America.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck. American
cleanup crews are expected to reach the site sometime this week.
   Some scientists said the effects of the spill may be magnified
because it involved fuel oil, more dangerous to wildlife than crude
oil, and because Antarctic conditions could slow the oil's
decomposition.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said Polly Penhale,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from a large seal population, some 30,000 sea birds live in
the area affected by the spill, including Adele and chinstrap
penguins, cormorants, kelp gulls and giant petrels, Penhale said.
   ``It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful areas in the
whole Antarctica,'' said Sayed Z. El-Sayed, an oceanography
professor at Texas A&amp;M University who has studied it for 25 years.
   Most plants and animals live on islands off the mainland, where
the science foundation operates Palmer Station on a spit of rock.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, DeLaca said.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, he said.
   ``All the principal (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Birds can freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural
insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening
themselves or eating contaminated prey.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, focusing on birds and seals and also on such organisms as
fish, kelp, krill and shelled animals called limpets.
   ``One of the main concerns of the scientists ... is that that
area stay pristine, because we have a lot of environmental research
that's going on,'' said Langdon Quetin, research biologist at the
University of California in Santa Barbara.
   ``It is one of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good
logistics to,'' he said. The spill ``will be the ruination of a good
laboratory, at least in the near future, at least as a natural
uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other
organisms kept in tanks at Palmer Station, which marine botanist
Mike Neushul of the University of California at Santa Barbara calls
``probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.''
   The tanks draw seawater from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, Penhale said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is much more toxic than
crude oil because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
Baja California 30 years ago, said that spill caused mass deaths of
fish, starfish, sea urchins and other animals. The same may happen
to similar animals in the Antarctic, he said.
   In the California spill, the environment took 17 years to
recover, he said. Recovery in Antarctica may take even longer
because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down,
said Paul Dayton, professor of marine ecology at the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.
   After years of studying wildlife in a pristine environment,
researchers are now turning to monitor how the wildlife responds to
the oil spill, Talmadge said. ``This disaster is the experiment
nobody wanted,'' he said.

THINGS HATCHING AT SEA WORLD'S PENGUIN ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At 10 degrees below freezing, the delivery room at Sea World is colder than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, however, a record-breaking number of feathered couples have 
become parents at the marine park's "Penguin Encounter," and recently the 45 
tiny hatchlings have started to get some notice. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to 
resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of 
the 14 fast-growing adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside 
their nests. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are 
not yet on public display. Besides 23 more adelies, two baby gentoo penguins 
are being hand-raised by park keepers, the first gentoos to be born from eggs 
laid in captivity at Sea World. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being 
hand-raised as well, and keepers say that, by observing the young, they hope to 
learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a oil spill off the coast of Chile or Peru where the Humboldts 
are, that could disrupt the whole species," said Joop Kuhn, supervisor of 
aviculture at Sea World. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how 
much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 penguins, the marine park's 6-year-old exhibit is the 
largest penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted 
with the National Science Foundation, the park keeps detailed records on each 
penguin from nine species. 
</P>
<P>
There's a file, for example, on King Tut, the first king penguin park keepers 
hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on Elvis, 
another king penguin named for the "king of rock 'n' roll," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many 
offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part, they're 
monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Park experts know which birds have showed a knack for keeping their eggs warm, 
and which birds have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They 
know that a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do, as a kind of "insurance," 
Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most penguin species will lay two eggs 
</P>
<P>
but rarely will they be able to raise both young. It's survival of the 
fittest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing 
the second eggs from the nests before they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by 
artificial incubating," Kuhn said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and 
leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there." 
</P>
<P>
The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a 
tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream, 
water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated 
meals their parents would feed them in the wild, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said the park had also hoped to hatch some chinstrap penguins this year, 
which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the 
black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at Sea World this 
year. But the eggs proved infertile. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year they try and do it," Kuhn said. "They do their best sitting on 
the eggs. Hopefully, by the second year, they've figured out the copulation 
thing and see if they can pull it off."

At 22 degrees Fahrenheit, the delivery room at Sea World may be colder than 
most, but no less productive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more feathered couples than ever are becoming parents at the marine 
park's "Penguin Encounter" and their 45 hatchlings are attracting attention.

   A ship laden with more than 50 tons of
equipment headed toward the Antarctic today to try and contain an
oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to
wipe out a colony of baby penguins.
   The spill, from a sunken Argentine supply ship, has fouled the
once-pure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than
24,000 penguins and other nesting birds, said biologist Ted De Laca.
   ``It's very disturbing. Everything right now is worrisome,'' said
De Laca, a researcher at the Palmer Station, a U.S. research outpost
on the Antarctic Peninsula.
   About 52 tons of equipment flown from the United States was
loaded onto the 219-foot Polar Duke here from a giant U.S. Air Force
C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
   The Polar Duke departed shortly after 6 p.m. Friday and was
expected to reach the area in four days.
   The oil is leaking from the Argentine research and supply ship
Bahia Paraiso, which is trapped and nearly submerged on shoals in
the Bismarck Strait just off the Antarctic peninsula.
   Thousands of penguins, terns, gulls and other birds live around
the site of the accident, and the waters teem with marine life,
including whales. Two areas nearby are set aside by the Antarctic
Treaty for scientific study.
   Punta Arenas is at the windblown tip of South America about 600
miles from the stricken Argentine vessel.
   Thomas Forhan, ocean projects manager for the National Science
Foundation in Washington, leads the cleanup mission.
   American scientists, wearing respirators as protection against
the smell of oil fumes, are working in open boats to try to limit
the damage, but De Laca said ``virtually all of the area is exposed
to fuel,'' causing young birds to disappear and killing small sea
animals ``in large numbers.''
   De Laca spoke by telephone with the The Associated Press in
Washington.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookeries in the affected area, and
De Laca said 38 of the 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel-dipped.''
   The fear of the experts, he said, is that penguin chicks, due to
leave nests within a few days, will swim in the oil-coated water and
be sickened or killed. At least three dead penguins have been
sighted, said De Laca.
   ``All of the rookeries are surrounded by oil,'' he said.
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   ``We have a slick 150 meters (yards) by 2 miles long going south
from the vessel,'' moving ``along and a little bit away'' from the
coast, Forhan said in an interview aboard the Polar Duke.
   He said there were reports of birds smothered by oil and of dead
krill, shrimp-like creatures that whales feed upon in large numbers,
floating ashore.
   Scientists and workers at Palmer Station collected 112 compressed
gas cylinders and 15 oil drums from the waters around the wreck,
Forhan said, and ``there are more in the water.''
   The Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 25. The more than 250 people
aboard were taken off without injury.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. team of experts and 50 tons of
equipment headed to the Antarctic on Wednesday to battle a huge oil
spill that experts said was killing wildlife in the pristine polar
region.
   A U.S. Air Force cargo plane was bound for the southern city of
Punta Arenas, where the equipment will be transferred to a U.S.
research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said.
   Officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitude
of the spill, which was caused by a sunken Argentine supply ship,
but said it represented the first major environmental threat to the
Antarctic.
   The National Science Foundation in Washington said the crippled
Argentine ship carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an
``incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into the
unspoiled waters in the region.
   In Buenos Aires, the Argentine navy played down the spill and
said it did not pose a serious ecological threat.
   But U.S. officials on Wednesday launched a massive effort to stem
the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the
southwest, said Jack Talmadge, a spokesman for the National Science
Foundation.
   The spill occurred after the Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay), an
Argentine navy vessel, ran aground on Saturday in the Bismarck
Strait, about 600 miles south of the southern tip of South America
and 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station in Antarctica.
   All passengers and crew were rescued, but the vessel floated free
in heavy seas and then capsized Tuesday night, spilling barrels of
oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water,
Talmadge said.
   ``It has leaked oil,'' he said. ``We're not sure whether the oil
leak is continuing. The water surrounding the ship is covered with a
couple of centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of
oil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil
on the coastline of the several islands there.''
   A private yacht 10-15 miles away reported earlier that it had
seen oil patches on the water, he said. Oil also was spotted at the
research station.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, Talmadge said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   A National Science Foundation statement said about 12,000 pairs
of penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year.
   ``In a few weeks, hatchling penguins will leave their nests and
enter the now-fouled Antarctic waters, as will their parents,'' said
the statement.
   A team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant U.S. Air
Force C-5B cargo plane left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday. It was to
arrive here on Thursday and then go by ship across the Drake Passage
to the accident site along the Antarctic Peninsula by Monday,
Talmadge said.
   The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic
Program, which includes Palmer Station, a scientific outpost.
   Talmadge said scientists from the station have been going out in
boats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels and
propane containers floating in the water.
   ``We're trying to get those, but that's a pretty massive
project,'' he said. ``We're using all the lifeboats from the ship
and any other boats we can get hold of in the area.''
   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-up
mission, with assistance from the U.S. Air Force, Navy and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said: ``There could
be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of the
ship. ``Anything else, no,'' He said.
   The ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar
stations. All 300 ship occupants were taken to the Palmer station
after the vessel ran aground.
   Another National Science Foundation spokesman in Washington, Jack
Renerie, said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane was
carrying a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms to
contain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading the
equipment.
   He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private U.S.
clean-up companies, Marine Polution Control and Global Associates.

<HEAD>Baby Gulls Dying From Antarctic Oil Slick</HEAD>

   Chilean frogmen worked to stop oil from
leaking from a partially submerged ship off Antarctica, authorities
said, and a report today said thousands of polar seabirds have
already died near the spreading slick.
   Crewmen from the Chilean cutter Yelcho on Tuesday encircled the
nearly sunken Argentina vessel Bahia Paraiso with floating booms
designed to contain any further leakage, said a navy communique
released in Santiago.
   New Zealand Press Association today reported that thousands of
baby Polar Skua gulls had died because their parents were unable to
find food.
   The predatory birds also can freeze to death if the oil disrupts
their natural insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil while
preening themselves or eat contaminated prey.
   The news agency, citing unidentified scientists at the nearby
U.S. Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, said the oil slick
has surrounded penguin rookeries near the wrecked ship.
   An operator reached by telephone at the research station referred
all inquiries to the Washington-based National Science Foundation,
which oversees the base 590 miles from the tip of South America.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. The National Science
Foundation says oil is leaking slowly from the ship, which gradually
sank in the shallow waters. Only a section of its superstructure
remains above the surface.
   Foundation officials said Tuesday that a slick nearly 500 feet
wide and two miles long was trailing away from the vessel toward the
south, threatening the frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled
environment. Today's New Zealand report said the slick was four
miles long. It did not mention width.
   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to join
cleanup efforts. It carries military and civilian experts and 52
tons of sophisticated equipment.
   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also was at
the spill site evaluating environmental damage, said the insitute's
director, Antonio Massei.
   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around the
accident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many baby
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they are
worried the youngsters could suffocate in the oil.
   Other wildlife also is threatened, including krill, a tiny
shrimp-like crustacean considered a vital link in Antarctica's food
chain.
   U.S. researchers say a number of seals were seen covered with oil
and moving slowly in the waters.
   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels were in the area of the spill and planned
to help, according to the Chilean navy. However, the ships were
awaiting equipment being flown from Argentina to a Chilean-run base
200 miles from the wreckage.

<HEAD>Environmental Damage Grows From Antarctica Fuel Oil Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Birds and other wildlife in one of the most
remote parts of the world are being injured and killed by fuel oil
spilled from a ship wrecked on an Antarctica island, and more damage
is possible before cleanup crews arrive.
   Biologist Ted De Laca, chief scientist at Palmer Station in
Antarctica, said that more than 24,000 penguins and other birds are
endangered by an oil spill that threatens to wipe an entire
generation of chicks maturing in nests surrounded by the pollution.
Some wildlife already has been killed, he said.
   ``The environment has been compromised in a way that we can't
even evaluate right now,'' De Laca said in a telephone conference
call from Palmer Station. ``It's very disturbing. Everything right
now is worrisome.''
   Palmer Station scientists, wearing respirators to protect against
the eye-stinging fumes of the oil slick, worked in open boats to
recover debris littering the fouled bay and to evaluate the damage.
   But De Laca said a more effective effort to contain the spill
must await the arrival Monday of a Navy oil pollution control team
from the United States.
   He said the fuel oil is spilling from the Argentine ship Bahia
Paraiso at the rate of about two gallons a minute and if it
continues the vessel could dump about 250,000 gallons into the
previously pure, untainted waters nearby.
   The ship, which doubled as a cruise ship and a supply vessel for
an Argentine research station, ran aground near Palmer Station last
Saturday. It later floated free, went aground again 1.1 miles from
the U.S. outpost and then turned over on its right side against
another island. As it turned, fuel oil and deck cargo spilled into
the Palmer Station embayment, home to a number of large bird
rookeries.
   Palmer Station is a National Science Foundation research station.
Twenty-six scientists and staff are now working at the station under
the director of De Laca, the chief scientist. Palmer is about 600
miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America.
   De Laca reported that krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean, have
been killed by the thousands and are lining the nearby beaches.
Birds feeding on the krill seem sickened, he said. In a nesting area
of the Polar Skua, a bird of prey, up to 40 percent of the chicks
have disappeared, possibily because parent birds sickened by the oil
are unable to protect their young, he said.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookies in the affected area, and
De Laca said that 38 of 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel dipped.''
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   The precise number of animals killed by the oil is difficult to
calculate because other animals quickly eat the dead. ``It's pretty
depressing,'' he said.

   Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine
navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that
went aground Jan. 28 near an American Antarctic research station.
   A statement released Thursday by the Argentine Embassy said that
five Argentine naval ships that had been participating in
contamination control work were being withdrawn ``due to glacier and
meteorological conditions.''
   The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supply
ship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and that
all ``potential pollutants'' have been removed from the wrecked ship.
   American experts, however, say about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil
are still aboard the Bahia Paraiso and National Science Foundation
spokesman Jack Talmadge said that ``there has never been ship with
oil in it that withstood an Antarctica winter.''
   ``We're concerned about what might happen over the winter,'' he
said.
   The Bahia Paraiso lodged on rocks on DeLaca Island near the
Palmer station and dumped about 170,000 gallons of diesel and jet
fuel into the pristine waters nearby. An American research camp
called Palmer Station is 1.1 miles away.
   Experts from the United States and Argentina stopped further
leaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil, but the
Argentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain in
the Bahia Paraiso tanks.
   Talmadge said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible to
shifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter.
   The approaching Antarctic winter will not halt American efforts,
Talmadge said, because the NSF icebreaker Polar Duke is able to
operate out of Palmer Station in virtually all seasons.
   The Argentine statement also claimed that ``no visible harm to
the local ecosystem was noticed, especially with respect to its
fauna.''
   But experts at the National Science Foundation, which operates
the U.S. research program in the region, said that the spill of fuel
oil from the Bahia Paraiso did cause some loss of wildlife in the
area near Palmer Station, and that the eventual impact of the spill
may not be known for years.
   An extra team of American scientists went to Palmer Station
earlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fuel
oil spill. They are expected to return in April.
   NSF scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spill
since the ship first went aground and have reported:
   _Among a population of 30,000 birds of at least eight species,
fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result of
ingesting the fuel oil. However, there is indirect evidence of other
losses.
   _Penguins returning to the sea after nesting were forced to swim
through oil-covered water. Some penguins now are apparently being
eaten at sea by giant petrels, a long-winged bird. ``This diet,
unusual for petrels, is evidence that the oil spill affected
penguins,'' an NSF statement says.
   _An entire generation of South Polar skuas died in one rookery
near Palmer Station. The skua is a gull-like bird of prey. NSF
experts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spill
and failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and other
predatory birds. There are, however, many skua rookeries in the
South Polar region.
   _The loss most feared by scientists is that the area around
Palmer Station, which has been a science outpost for 20 years, may
no longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by the
oil spill. ``The usefulness of ... Palmer Station for basic research
(of) the undisturbed Antarctic ecosystem is in question,'' an NSF
statement said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear
were bound for Antarctica on Thursday to tackle a fuel oil spill
that officials said threatened baby penguins about to take their
first swim.
   A giant U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy cargo plane carrying the gear
and experts landed in Punta Arenas, on the straits of Magellan, the
official news agency Orbe reported.
   From there, the mission was to board the Polar Duke, a U.S.
research ship bound for the spill, about 590 miles south of the Cape
Horn.
   Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, said the Polar Duke
was to depart Friday and take about four days to reach the spill,
just off the Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S.
scientific base Palmer Station.
   ``Our concern right now is primarily for the birds,'' he told
reporters at Santiago's airport. ``All the young penguins are just
about at the age where they take their first swim.
   ``When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could
be the last time.''
   There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, which
occurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rock
Saturday and listed before sinking Tuesday.
   The 9,300-ton vessel, the Paradise Bay, was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel, according to the Science Foundation.
   The boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, and
hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped
from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday
``there really wasn't a (significant) spill.''
   A short communique issued by the Argentine navy said its planes
will fly over the sunken vessel ``to make a visual evaulation of the
damage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best means
to employ to combat the effects that could be presented.''
   Also, an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene Friday to ``assess
the best ways available to combat the pollution,'' the communique
said.
   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said
hundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created a
slick up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports
appeared exaggerated.
   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''
said navy spokesman Lt. Juan Pablo Barros.
   Jack Renirie, a Science Foundation spokesman said, however, that
a slick did exist and that personnel at Palmer Station were
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around
the grounded ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels in the water'' that slipped from the vessel's deck, Renirie
said in a telephone interview from Santiago. ``And there's still oil
coming out of the ship.''
   Inderbitzen said the Science Foundation, which organized the
cleanup mission and directs all U.S. activities in Antarctica,
feared lasting environmental damage.
   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had
caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,
Renirie said.
   Inderbitzen said Antarctica's delicate, unspoiled environment
requires special measures to contain the spill, which is near two
areas set aside for special scientific study under terms of the
Antarctic Treaty.
   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to
recover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in Antarctica, it takes
plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.
It's a very, very fragile environment.''
   The U.S. cargo plane, which is twice the size of a Boeing 747,
carries a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatable
booms to contain drifting oil.
   The cleanup work will be peformed by Marine Pollution Control
Co., under contract to the U.S. Navy, Renirie said.
   The Chilean navy said it will provide logistical support and
dispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist ``in
case any contamination exists.''

<TEXT>
   Damage to the pristine Antarctic
environment from an Argentine ship that ran aground and leaked oil
appears to be less than initially feared, a U.S. scientist reported
Thursday .
   ``There were not thousands of birds killed. What we saw was the
death of a few birds and there may be more,'' said Ted DeLaca, chief
of the Division of Polar Programs of the Washington-based National
Science Foundation.
   ``Some said this was an eco-catastrophe of biblical proportions.
That clearly is not true. Others said it was nothing. That's not
true, either. The truth is somewhere in between.''
   Many krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean that is the main food
for whalebone whales, washed up on islands after the Bahia Paraiso
ran aground on Jan. 28 and began leaking fuel oil.
   The Argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for a
tourist excursion.
   The accident took place near the U.S. polar research station
Palmer on the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles below the tip of South
America. DeLaca was on the scene and helped organize the transfer of
tourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats.
   The partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tons
of diesel oil, butane, compressed gas and other fuel, which
immediately began to leak. How much leaked and how much will be
recovered was not known, DeLaca said.
   He said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil or
getting it on themselves, and thousands of limpets, a small, marine
animal, also died.
   However, navy experts from Argentina and Chile and scientists
aboard the foundation vessel Polar Duke quickly recovered floating
fuel canisters, patched the Bahia Paraiso's hull, stopped the leak
and contained the spill and now are cleaning it up.
   ``For the most part, the stuff that went into the water seems to
have dispersed and gone away,'' DeLaca, a bearded, 45-year-old
marine microbiologist, said in an interview.
   The concern now is what possible long-term effects the spill may
have on animal and plant life and on research such as that conducted
at Palmer since 1970.
   ``The Antarctic is a hostile, unforgiving environment,'' DeLaca
said. ``The organisms that live there are specially adapted. The
margins for survival are narrow. ... Anything that takes away an
edge, that compromises their fitness, could mean the difference
between life and death.''
   He said ingesting oil may affect the penguins' capacity to store
oxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food. Oil on the
feathers of skuas, a large predator bird related to the seagull,
could affect their ability to float or stay warm.
   Lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breeding
patterns and the ability of young creatures to survive, he said.
   He said researchers also will wonder now whether the results they
obtain are valid, or a reflection of the oil spill.
   ``This is the first significant spill in Antarctica,'' DeLaca
said. ``It was a pristine environment and experimental results were
taken as accurate indicators of the Antarctic environment. This
spill could call into question future results.''
   A team of scientists from the United States, Argentina and Chile
will arrive at Palmer Station next month to collect data before
winter sets in.
   ``When next spring comes is when the story will be told'' about
the damage caused by the spill, DeLaca said.
   ``The environment will recover. No question about that. The
question is, is what comes back what was there before.''

   Chilean navy frogmen plunged into icy
Antarctic waters Tuesday to seal shut the fuel tanks of a crippled
ship and stop the spread of an oil slick threatening the pristine
area's wildlife, authorities said.
   A navy communique said the cutter Yelcho arrived Monday night,
the first cleanup vessel to get to the spill site 590 miles from the
tip of South America and close to the shores of the Antarctic
Peninsula.
   Crew members Tuesday morning encircled the nearly sunken vessel
Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) with floating booms designed to contain
any further oil leak, according to the communique read by a
spokesman at navy headquarters in Santiago.
   Divers then entered the frigid waters to seal shut the Bahia
Paraiso's tanks, it said.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28
about two miles from Palmer Station U.S. research base. Scientists
say the area teams with wildlife, including thousands of penguins.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. Officials of the
Washington-based National Science Foundation say oil is leaking
slowly from the ship, which gradually sank in the shallow waters.
Only a section of its superstructure remains above the surface.
   They say a slick nearly 500 feet wide and two miles long is
trailing away from the vessel toward the south, threatening the
frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled environment.
   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to arrive at
the spill later Tuesday. It carries a multimillion-dollar cleanup
mission organized by the National Science Foundation that includes
military and civilian experts and 52 tons of sophisticated equipment.
   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels are in the area of the spill and plan to
help, according to the Chilean navy. However, they await equipment
being flown from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a Chilean-run Antarctic
base 200 miles from the accident.
   An Argentine Embassy official in Santiago told reporters Monday
the government would try to salvage the Bahia Paraiso once the
environmental threat is stemmed.
   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also is at
the spill site to evaluate environmental damage, said the insitute's
acting director, Antonio Massei.
   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around the
accident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many baby

   U.S. experts were en route today to
Antarctica to clean an oil spill that threatens the delicate
ecosystem, but an environmentalist said only a few weeks remain
before the area's frigid waters begin to freeze.
   A giant C-5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gear
to the southern port of Punta Arenas on Thursday. The crew was to
board on a U.S. research ship departing today for the spill, about
590 miles south of the Cape Horn.
   Anton Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, said the vessel Polar
Duke would take about four days to reach the spill, just off the
Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S. scientific
base Palmer Station.
   However, a Greenpeace spokesman cautioned that less than two
months remain to contain the damage.
   ``They can't hang around too long,'' said Peter Wilkinson from
the Greenpeace ship Gondwana in Antarctic waters. ``By mid- to
late-April the ice will start to freeze over.''
   ``Any ship that's underwater in Antarctica with that amount of
fuel poses a big problem,'' he said in a radio telephone interview
to Sydney, Australia.
   The environmental group is calling for an international effort to
contain damage caused by the sinking Tuesday of an Argentine navy
vessel that, according to the National Science Foundation, was
carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel.
   In a stop in Santiago on Thursday, Inderbitzen told reporters the
crew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the polluted
area.
   ``All the young penguins are just about at the age where they
take their first swim,'' he said. ``When these birds enter the water
for the first time, it could be the last time.''
   The 9,300-ton Paradise Bay was leaking fuel oil at an
undetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of
compressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday,

Foul weather off the tip of South America on Thursday forced one Argentine ship 
to abandon its effort to reach a stricken vessel that is leaking oil into the 
pristine waters off Antarctica, and scientists warned that as winter approaches 
in the Southern Hemisphere, storms could soon cut off any hopes of salvaging 
the ship and containing the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't solve it right away, the winter storms will tear it up," said 
UCLA marine biologist Bill Hamner, who has spent five seasons studying the area 
where the ship ran around last Saturday just two miles from the National 
Science Foundation's Palmer Station. A second Argentine vessel should arrive in 
the area today, but it is not clear if that ship is equipped to attempt salvage 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that the stricken ship was still afloat despite earlier 
reports that it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
Hamner and others said the accident could not have happened at a worse time for 
the wildlife in the area, particularly the penguins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds' Insulation in Peril 
</P>
<P>
One of Antarctica's largest penguin colonies is in the area, Hamner said, "and 
this is the time when the penguins are fishing most heavily" and young penguins 
are beginning to swim. 
</P>
<P>
That will expose them to the oily water and tar that could destroy the 
insulation system that protects them from the cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Hamner said the penguin's feathers trap a layer of air between "the skin and 
the outside, so the birds can swim in ice water, and they are not cold because 
they are beautifully insulated. It probably wouldn't require very much tar to 
break down the insulation and bring cold into direct contact with the body 
core." 
</P>
<P>
Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of the Antarctic staff for the National Science 
Foundation, told reporters in Santiago, Chile, that the greatest concern now is 
that the oil will affect the young birds. 
</P>
<P>
"All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first 
swim," he said. "When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could 
be the last time." 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports Thursday over just how much oil has already 
leaked from the vessel, which is 80% under water but still afloat, according to 
Jack Renirie, spokesman for the National Science Foundation in Washington. The 
Argentine Ministry of Defense initially said the leakage from the Argentine 
cruise ship, the Bahia Paraiso, "really wasn't a significant spill" but later 
conceded some contamination is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Observers in the area radioed to officials in Washington that a spill several 
miles long had been sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Any spill in such a pristine area is bound to have a serious local impact, 
although Renirie said the incident was not likely to be as "catastrophic" as 
some reports have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a tanker," Renirie said. The ship was carrying about 250,000 
gallons of bunker oil used for its own propulsion system, plus 200 barrels of 
other types of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, large tankers carry many millions of gallons of oil and are 
capable of creating massive oil slicks during accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the area is running in the mid-40s, because it is still 
summer in Antarctica, but winter is rapidly approaching. Heavy storms could hit 
the area by the end of this month, and by late March the weather is expected to 
be so foul that little could be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed Every Animal 
</P>
<P>
When the tanker Tampico ran aground near Ensenada in April, 1957, it released 
diesel fuel into the Pacific, and Stewart said it proved extremely toxic to 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"It essentially killed every animal in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear arrived in Chile on Thursday aboard a 
U.S. Air Force C-5B. From there the experts and their equipment were to be 
loaded aboard the U.S. research ship Polar Duke for the 600-mile, four-day trip 
to Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
All 316 persons aboard the 435-foot Bahia Paraiso were rescued by other vessels 
in the area.

<TEXT>
   An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
   The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from
the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
   No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the
government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
   The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
   The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science
Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
   The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer
Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation
statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
Thursday or Friday.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to Palmer Station.
   The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement
said.

   NEW YORK -- Pearson PLC's Penguin USA named two executives
to the top editorial posts at its principal hardcover and
paperback divisions.
   Al Silverman, a vice president and contributing editor of
Penguin USA, was named publisher and editor in chief of the
Viking division, which publishes hardcovers. Mr. Silverman,
65 years old, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Time Warner Inc.'s Book of the Month Club before joining
Penguin in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Silverman succeeds Christine Pevitt, who resigned in
June. Ms. Pevitt presided over both the hardcover and
paperback divisions, but those duties have now been split.
   Kathryn Court, 43, was named publisher and editor in chief
of Penguin Books, the paperback division. Ms. Court had been
editorial director of Penguin.
   Literary agents and other publishers applauded the
appointments, saying both Mr. Silverman and Ms. Court are
known as skilled editors and "book lovers," unlike some
recent management hires in publishing, whose experience was
more financial than literary.
   Also, Penguin USA named Arnold Dolin, 63, to the new post
of publisher and editor in chief of Plume Books, the
paperback line in the NAL/Dutton division. Mr. Dolin
continues to serve as associate publisher of NAL/Dutton.
   The appointments follow a period of turbulence at Penguin
USA. After a drop in profit in 1990, the publisher shuffled
executives, streamlined its back-office operations, abolished
about 20 jobs and cut back its list of titles by more than
10%.
   John F. Moore, recently named president of Penguin USA,
said the company's performance has improved considerably. He
said Penguin USA had "the best fourth quarter in the
company's history."

   NEW YORK -- Penguin USA, a publisher that has suffered
declining profits and management turmoil, announced the
departure of the head of its Viking hardcover division along
with a top editor there.
   Christine Pevitt, publisher of the Viking Penguin division
of Penguin USA, whose parent is London-based Pearson PLC,
left "to pursue other interests," the company said. Penguin
insiders cited conflicts between Ms. Pevitt and her two
superiors, Michael Jacobs, Viking Penguin president, and
Peter Mayer, chairman of Penguin USA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Pevitt, who had been with the publisher about four
years and took on the top job at Viking about 18 months ago,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Also departing is senior executive editor Amanda Vaill, 42
years old, a 14-year veteran who has edited such authors as
Taylor Branch, Iris Murdoch and T.C. Boyle. Replacements
weren't named for either post.
   In 1990, Penguin reported a 20% drop in world-wide profit.
Like most publishers of trade (general-interest) books,
Penguin's sales have slumped in the recession. In recent
years it also has suffered severe distribution problems, a
rash of complaints from authors about royalty statements, and
problems resulting from the 1989 merger of NAL/Dutton, which
included editorial cutbacks.
   Along the way, Penguin USA has fired or lost a number of
top managers who still haven't been replaced, including
Morton Mint, who quit as chief executive officer last August
after 10 months in the job. Marvin Brown, chief
administrative officer, was put in as a replacement "for the
time being," but still serves in that capacity. After two
years, the top editorial post at the Penguin paperback
division still hasn't been filled.
   Mr. Jacobs, who has been president of Viking Penguin for
about a year, called the latest departures "strictly some
personnel moves that are necessary," rather than a plan to
reduce staff levels. He added that "both Viking and Penguin
distinctly need someone to lead them, and I'm looking for
strong editorial leaders. I think this is a great house, but
we can publish books better."
   The publisher will be cutting the number of titles it
publishes by 10% to 20% in both hardcover and paperback, said
Mr. Jacobs. Viking publishes about 150 hardcover titles a
year; Penguin publishes about 250 paperback titles.
   Referring to perceptions in the publishing industry that
Viking Penguin has been in turmoil and trouble for several
years, Mr. Jacobs said: "I'm tired of hearing about it.
Changing perceptions isn't easy, but the perception of this
house needs to be strengthened. Some people still think we
have distribution problems, for one thing, and they were
solved 18 months ago."

   A U.S. Air Force plane carrying tons of
equipment and a team of clean-up experts headed to Antarctica today
to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major
environmental threat.
   The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of Punta
Arenas, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferred
to a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago said.
   In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floating
oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four
miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National Science
Foundation said.
   The agency said in Washington the Argentine supply vessel that
released the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster'' would
result if all the fuel leaks into the region's unspoiled waters.
   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said the spill would
not pose a serious ecological threat.
   A spokesman for the Chilean navy agreed. ``The information that
we have is that there is no big spill,'' said Lt. Juan Pablo Barros
in a telephone interview today.
   The Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) ran aground on Saturday in the
Bismarck Strait, 600 miles south of the southern tip of South
America and 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station on the
Antarctic Peninsula. The ship was carrying supplies for Antarctic
outposts and sightseers.
   All 250 passengers and crew were rescued, but the ship floated
free in heavy seas and sank Tuesday, dropping barrels of oil and
several hundred propane gas containers into the water, said Jack
Talmadge, a spokesman for the National Science Foundation.
   Another foundation spokesman in Washington, Jack Renerie, said
most of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may not
be great. However, ``There's a bunch of free (drifting) oil down
there,'' he said. ``The slick has arrived at Palmer Station,'' a
scientific outpost run by the foundation.
   Renerie said personnel at the station had collected some steel
barrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels (still) in the water,'' Renerie said in a telephone
interview today from Santiago. ``And there's still oil coming out of
the ship.''
   He said the ship is about ``80 to 90 percent underwater'' but
appears to have settled firmly on a shoal.
   ``The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of
centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of oil in a
much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on the
coastline of the several islands there,'' Talmadge said.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, Talmadge said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   The Air Force transport left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday and was
to arrive in Chile today. Talmadge said its crew and 52 tons of
cargo would reach the accident site by Monday.
   The cargo includes a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up
spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat;
inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck for
loading and unloading the equipment, said Renerie. He said it was
accompanied by a crew from two private U.S. clean-up companies,
Marine Pollution Control and Global Associates.
   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-up
mission with assistance from the Air Force, Navy and the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

<TEXT>
   For two decades scientists
enjoyed a cloistered existence at this U.S. research center,
studying wildlife in conditions as unspoiled as anywhere in the
world.
   No longer.
   The mission of Palmer Station, perched on a gravelly point
beneath a towering glacier, changed overnight when the Argentine
supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 28 and spilled its cargo
of diesel fuel just offshore.
   ``This is changing from a place where people studied untouched
nature long-term to a place where people study the effects of an oil
spill long-term,'' said Margaret Rubega, an ornithologist from The
University of California-Irvine. She was studying skuas and kelp
gulls at the station when the wreck occurred.
   ``As an ecosystem that was basically undisturbed, it's a horrible
loss. Really it's tragic,'' Miss Rubega said.
   William Fraser, an ornithologist from the Point Reyes (Calif.)
Bird Observatory, said there already are indications of some
poisoning of penguins, skuas, cormorants and other bird species that
populate the rocky islands around the spill.
   ``We have no direct evidence of heavy mortality, but we have
indirect evidence,'' he said.
   Scavanging giant petrels who live on the rocky islands around the
base were feeding their newborn chicks an unusually rich diet of
penguin meat after the spill, Fraser said.
   ``What this means is you had large numbers of penguins dying
locally.''
   In addition, 726 pairs of polar skuas were nesting in the area
when the spill occurred.
   ``Every single one lost their chicks,'' Frazer said.
   He stressed that the evidence was not conclusive. A team of 15
U.S. scientists has just begun more comprehensive studies.
   Ironically, the site offers an excellent base of information for
a before-and-after examination of a spill. The wealth of data on
bird and marine life collected since the station went into operation
can be used for comparison, Fraser said.
   ``It's a terrible disaster, but it's an incredible natural
experiment.''

   An Argentine ship which ran aground off the
Antarctic Peninsula has floated free, and a leak of diesel fuel that
was threatening penguins and other wildlife has stopped, National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday.
   But the ship, from which all passengers and crew members have
been evacuated, is in danger of sinking.
   Renerie said the vessel is taking on water, is down at the stern
where water is up to the first deck, and is heeled over 25 degrees.
   Two Argentine vessels were headed to the vessel to try to pump
the remaining fuel from the ship and salvage it if possible, but it
remained in danger of sinking and had drifted against a nearby
island, he said.
   In Argentina, the government news agency Telam reported that the
ship, the Bahia Paraiso, would probably be towed to Rio Gallegos,
Argentina to be repaired.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The ship, a 400-foot-long double-hulled vessel, ran aground
Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research
facility which is located about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the
tip of South America.
   The 316 people aboard, including 82 passengers and 234 crew
members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station.
The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the
South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South
American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station,
said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, said a NSF statement.
   The crewmen will remain until the two Argentine salvage vessels
are expected arrive Thursday or Friday, the statement said.
   The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of
the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore
near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' the NSF statement said.
   The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and
canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, it said.

   And station workers said only fair weather prevented a disaster.
They said most of the Bahia Paraiso's lifeboats were open,
inflatable rafts without oars or motors. The day was calm and they
could be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty. But
they could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatile
Antarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse, the workers said.
   In response to the diesel spill, the National Science Foundation
dispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tons
of specialized equipment. The mission cost more than $2 million. The
Chilean and Argentine navies also sent costly clean-up missions.
   The clean-up ended in mid-March, although the Bahia Paraiso still
holds about 63,000 gallons that can't be safely reached and pumped
out. It could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm or
simply seep out for many months as the wreck gradually
disintegrates. Experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreck
away.
   The area of the spill teems with wildlife, including penguins,
skuas, cormorants, Arctic terns and other birds. Seals and whales
frequently pass through the bay.
   Scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that many
penguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill, but they have
been unable to determine the extent of the damage. A special team of
15 researchers from the United States, Argentina and Chile has
arrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spill's environmental
impact. It will take years to complete.
   Yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made. Since the
United States has no property rights to the area at or around Palmer
Station, it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation. The area
of the accident, on the Antarctic Peninsula, is claimed by Chile,
Argentina and Great Britain.
   Chile recently announced plans to propose, at the next Antarctic
Treaty meeting in Paris in October, an article to hold each country
financially responsible for environmental or other damage. The
Science Foundation plans to press for agreement on cost sharing in
clean-up of spills and other accidents, and for formation of an
international coordinating office for emergencies.
   But there could be some opposition.
   ``We must act with prudence, without falling into decisions that
could be a little hasty,'' said Roberto Daverede, head of Antarctic
affairs for the Argentine Foreign Ministry. Argentina claims a thick
wedge of the continent and, like the other claimant nations, rejects
any foreign or international jurisdiction.
   Daverede played down the effects of the Bahia Paraiso spill.
   ``This is far from being a natural catastrophe,'' he said. He
called the wreck ``an isolated incident.''
   Nonetheless, less than a month after the Bahia Paraiso accident a
Peruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away, near King George
Island. The vessel, called the Humboldt and touted as the flagship
of Peru's territorial claim, also spilled some diesel fuel but was
soon refloated.
   By world standards neither accident would qualify as a major
environmental disaster.
   ``I've walked away from bigger diesel spills than this where
nothing died, absolutely nothing,'' said Jim O'Brien of Gretna, La.,
a pollution control expert hired by the U.S. government for the
Bahia Paraiso clean-up.
   But there is special concern that Antarctica's environment may be
especially fragile. There's also a growing belief that its huge cold
mass plays a key role in long-term global weather patterns.
   There also are some indications that the strain on the local
environment may be straining political relations.
   For decades, a unique spirit of international friendship and
cooperation has reigned in Antarctica. Political conficts were left
at the doorstep, and missions from such idealogically distinct
countries as the Soviet Union and right-wing Chile lived as
next-door neighbors, sharing supplies, equipment and a drink or two
on the cold nights.
   In early March, however, the Chileans criticized what they called
the poor waste handling at the Soviet Bellinghousen base, literally
a stone's from their own Marsh base on King George Island. They said
they would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting.

   U.S. tour operators are planning to send a
record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for
strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife
and the very fate of the frozen continent.
   ``The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than
tripled in the past five years,'' said Bruce Manheim, a Washington
activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing
controls inadequate.
   Antarctica has become a ``hot'' travel destination for the
1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a
privileged few in their youth.
   They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry,
an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.
   About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988,
3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the
December-February summer season. Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
   ``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said Manheim.
   He filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more
regulation.
   ``We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to
Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be
regulated carefully,'' he said.
   Concern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the
Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000
gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and
other marine life. The vessel remains at the site off Palmer
Station with some oil in its tanks.
   Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise
Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years
to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.
   Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on
its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. The
first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.
   Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on
tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
   He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same
wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and
other birds.
   ``A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental
disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar
catastrophes,'' said Manheim.
   The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are
already in place.
   ``We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with
the explosion of Antarctica tourism,'' said Jack Talmadge of the
National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in
Antarctica.
   Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations,
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and
taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.
   He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to
minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of
ship visits.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim
slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is
larger than the United States and Mexico combined.
   Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists
have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first
tourists visited in 1958.
   Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its
Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines
began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
   Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel,
airstrip and hovercraft dock. The Canada-based Adventure Network
currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.
   But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by
U.S.-based operators. Conservationists say the United States should
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
   ``Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United
States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international
level,'' said Manheim.
   Operators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for
alarm.
   ``The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined
environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you
that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,''
said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will
lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.
   James Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes
that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often
return home more committed environmentalists _ ``Ambassadors of
Antarctica.''
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The scale of these activities is growing
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.''

<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar
international cleanup effort is concluding at the site of a wrecked
Argentine supply ship that still holds about 63,000 gallons of
diesel fuel, U.S. and Argentine officials said.
   The authorities interviewed this week said little more could be
done with the half-sunken ship, the Bahia Paraiso, before the
Antarctic winter sets in.
   ``The mission is practically completed,'' said Capt. Heberto
Rubatino, head of the Argentine navy's anti-pollution office. ``We
are sure we have checked out, cleaned up and controlled all of the
Bahia Paraiso's tanks.''
   Rubatino, in a meeting with U.S. authorities aboard an Argentine
navy cargo ship anchored near the site, said some of the Bahia
Paraiso's fuel storage tanks could not be reached safely by divers
to pump them out. He said they had been sealed.
   A U.S. navy salvage expert, William Walker, said the ship still
held about 63,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He agreed the fuel was
unreachable.
   He said the vessel had been carrying about 265,000 gallons of
diesel fuel when it ran aground Jan. 28 on shoals about two miles
from Palmer Station, a U.S. research base on the Antarctic Peninsula
about 600 miles from the tip of South America.
   The Bahia Paraiso rolled over and partially sank three days after
it ran aground. It is on its side, and part of its gashed orange
hull and its deck remain above the water line. The waters
immediately around the wreck are discolored and smell of fuel.
   The United States, Chile and Argentina sent teams and equipment
to the site. Walker said about 16,400 gallons of fuel was pumped out
of the wreck, after hundreds of thousands of gallons leaked out.
   Walker also said any effort to salvage the vessel, or to cut it
up and remove it from the site, would take three years and cost as
much as $60 million _ far more than the ship's value. Any decision
on whether to salvage the vessel would have to be made by Argentine
authorities, he said.
   Peter Wilkniss, polar programs director for the National Science
Foundation, said clean-up efforts by Argentine and U.S. experts
would conclude about March 15. He said scientists from the United
States, Argentina and Chile was being sent to Palmer Station to
study the spill's effects on the area's wildlife. The foundation
supervises all U.S. activities in Antarctica.
   He said the diesel still in the ship's tanks was expected to
continue to leak, ``maybe for as long as a year.'' Some floating
containment booms would be placed to try to control the leakage.
   ``There's little more we can do before winter sets in,'' he said.
   ``The best thing that could happen, as cruel as it sounds, is for
it (the ship) to break up and spill its guts all at once,'' he said.
This would bring contamination to a quicker end and allow the
wildlife to recuperate, he said.
   Wilkniss said, however, that experts were unable to predict
whether the ship would break up in a big storm or slowly rust
through.
   The Palmer Station area abounds with wildlife, including penguins
and seals. Scientists say they have found many dead seabirds,
including skuas and cormorants, and a few dead penguins, but are
unable to say for certain if pollution was to blame.
   Pollution experts say diesel fuel, because of its high
volatility, evaporates quickly and is less damaging to wildlife than
thicker petroleum products.
   On Feb. 26, a Peruvian research ship, the Humboldt, ran aground
in Antarctica near King George Island, 300 miles from Palmer
Station. Authorities said the Humboldt spilled a small amount of
fuel that was treated by the Chilean navy with chemical dispersants.
The ship was refloated March 6.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group on Saturday urged the
government to protect penguins and other Antarctic wildlife by
regulating companies that take tourists to that ice-bound continent.
   ``Repeated tourist visits will cause animals to abandon their
breeding sites or increase the vulnerability of their eggs and
young to predation,'' Environmental Defense Fund attorney Bruce
Manheim said in a statement.
   The New York-based group issued a report calling on the National
Science Foundation, the State Department and the Coast Guard to
establish a licensing system to ensure no damage to Antarctica from
tour groups.
   ``Although remote and generally inhospitable, Antarctica is now
visited by thousands of tourists each year who wish to see the
continent's pristine environment before it could be despoiled,''
the report said.
   It said ``most tourists are seriously concerned about protecting
Antarctica'' but ``their visits are often localized repetitive and
frequently occur at breeding grounds for penguins, seals and other
seabirds.''
   The report said ``frequent helicopter visits by the first
tourists to Antarctica _ diplomats and dignitaries visiting McMurdo
Station _ quickly resulted in a 50 percent reduction in the
southernmost Adelie Penguin rookery at Cape Royds.''
   It said Antarctic tourism is growing and one Australian company
hopes to develop and a hard-surface runway and luxury hotel on the
continent.
   Currently, however, most of the tour companies are American and
thus the federal government could do much to limit environmental
damage, it said.
   The group urged a ban on aircraft overflights within 1,500
meters of wildlife sites, guidelines on government observation of
wildlife, management plans for wildlife sites, advance information
requirements for expeditions, and coordination of tour visits to
wildlife areas.
   It also called for a monitoring program to assess the impact of
such visits, a ban on the disposal of oil, plastics and garbage
from tour vessels and strict regulation of vessel operations in
waters off Antarctica.
   The report was released on the first anniversary of the
grounding of the Bahia Paraiso, an Argentine tour vessel that
spilled more than 180,000 gallons of oil into wildlife breeding
areas, the report said. ``A year after Antarctica's most
significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations
to prevent similar catastrophes,'' it said.

<HEAD>Research Indicates Depletion of Ozone Could Threaten Food Supply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Antarctic researcher announced
findings Tuesday indicating that the depletion of the Earth's ozone
layer could threaten the world's food supply.
   Professor Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&amp;M University said increased
amounts of ultraviolet light, which a thinner ozone shield permits
through to the Earth's surface, supresses biological activity in
microscopic marine plants in the Antarctic.
   El-Sayed said his findings, the first of their kind, confirm
strong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might mean
trouble for fish, animal and other life in the southernmost part of
the world.
   On the other hand, ``I never underestimate the resilency of
nature,'' he said.
   El-Sayed said it is impossible now to say whether the plankton _
microscopic single-celled organisms called ``the grass of the sea''
_ and the organisms that feed on them might adapt to increased
ultraviolet radiation, and much work remains to be done.
   Plankton and the tiny shrimp-like creature called krill that
feed on them are the primary food source for the whole web of life
in the Antarctic, including fish, penguins and whales. A baleen
whale may eat three tons a day.
   ``If anything happened to the krill population, the whole
ecosystem probably would collapse, and you can say goodbye to the
whales and the penguins and the seals and the fish,'' El-Sayed told
reporters at briefing arranged by the World Resources Institute, a
Washington environmental research organization.
   Several nations are studying plans to harvest krill, a
550-million to 770-million ton reservoir of protein. A 10 percent
annual harvest would almost equal the current world fish catch.
   The ozone shield over Antarctica already thins greatly in
springtime, with the depletion reaching a record 50 percent last
year. Scientists attribute the destruction of ozone to man-made
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a 1 percent
drop in ozone means a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet light and a
4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin cancers.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on March 15
said a depletion of ozone at mid-latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere since 1969 was in all likelihood the result of those
chemicals. The Du Pont Co. said last week it plans to stop making
them.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters over lunch
Tuesday that the EPA and NASA would try to speed up the first
scientific review under last fall's treaty by 31 nations calling
for a cut in CFC production by 50 percent by 1998.
   Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate, subject of
a hearing Wednesday, calling for an early 95 percent cut in U.S.
production.
   A U.S. cut beyond international agreement might take the
pressure off other CFC-producing countries to act further, Thomas
said, and would add little to ozone protection.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer, was supported in his work
last fall on Anvers Island near Palmer Station by the National
Science Foundation. He and the foundation wanted to see if he could
extend earlier German findings that decreases in ultraviolet
enhance plankton growth.

<HEAD>Oil Slick Skimmed From Antarctic Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. clean-up team has begun to skim up
fuel oil that has threatened wildlife since it leaked into Antarctic
waters from a grounded Argentine supply ship late last month,
officials said Wednesday.
   Chilean divers also worked to patch the vessel's leaky hull, the
officials said.
   A 35-foot skimming boat rushed down from the United States began
cleaning up Tuesday, according to officials of the Chilean navy and
the National Science Foundation in Washington.
   A navy communique issued in Santiago said the boat skimmed the
waters near a U.S. research base, Palmer Station. ``There is a
notable reduction of contaminant in the water,'' it said.
   Authorities also planned to use the special craft inside a ring
of floating booms set up Tuesday by the Chilean navy to contain oil
around the leaking, nearly-sunken Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine
research and supply ship.
   The Bahia Paraiso, carrying more than 800 tons of fuel oil, ran
aground Jan. 28 on shoals about two miles from Palmer Station and
about 590 miles from the tip of South America.
   The oil has been slowly leaking, creating a slick two miles long
and threatening the frozen continent's pristine enviroment and
exotic wildlife. An estimated 29,000 thousands penguins nest in the
area.
   But Jack Renerie, a spokesman for the National Science
Foundation, said experts at Palmer Station have little precise
information on the impact so far.
   ``We've seen about six dead penguins so far, and oil on an awful
lot more of them,'' he said. ``But what the real extent will be we
don't know yet.''
   The United States, Chile and Argentina dispatched costly clean-up
missions to the site.
   Chilean navy divers ``inspected the hull of the sunken ship and
began patching efforts,'' the communique said. It said it was
believed that all leaks had been sealed.
   A U.S. vessel, the Polar Duke, arrived early Tuesday with 17
military and civilian clean-up experts and 52 tons of equipment,
including the skimming boat. The specialists and equipment were
flown down in a U.S. air force cargo plane to the southern Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, where they were put in the boat.

   NEW YORK -- Penguin USA, a unit of London-based Pearson
PLC, announced the resignation of Morton Mint, chief
executive officer. Mr. Mint has only been in the post since
late October, after years of running Penguin's operations in
Canada.
   The resignation was abrupt and shocked the publishing
community. Mr. Morton couldn't be reached for comment, nor
was Peter Mayer, executive chairman of Penguin USA,
available. The company released a statement that said the two
executives had "policy differences with respect to management
of the company in the future."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Penguin named Marvin Brown, chief administrative officer,
to the chief executive post "for the time being." The company
said Penguin USA will move toward more decentralization
within the company, with each of the adult divisions having
its own president as well as publisher.
   Penguin has been one of a number of publishing houses
experiencing turmoil in the past year after a time of rapid
growth by acquisition. Last fall, Penguin closed the adult
publishing division of E.P. Dutton, firing a number of
editors in what many in publishing felt was an insensitive
and abrupt manner.

SCIENTISTS TO STUDY KRILL IN ANTARCTICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists know that antarctic krill, 2 1/2-inch-long shrimplike creatures, are 
crucial in the food chain that sustains life in the undersea world of 
Antarctica. Krill are a staple for a wide range of antarctic creatures, 
including whales, seals, penguins and a host of other sea birds and fish. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists do not know what will happen to the antarctic food chain as 
krill are increasingly harvested for human and livestock consumption. Nearly 
half a dozen countries, including the Soviet Union, Japan and Korea, harvest 
krill, using new technology that makes it easier to pull the creatures from the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it is krill -- and their relationship to the rest of the 
antarctic world -- that scientists aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration research vessel Surveyor will study during a five-month voyage. 
The Surveyor is scheduled to cast off from San Diego's 10th Avenue Terminal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Three local scientists associated with the National Marine Fisheries Service's 
Southwest Fisheries Center in La Jolla will be among the Surveyor's dozen 
researchers. They are Izadore Barrett, director of science and research, and 
Roger Hewitt and Rennie Holt, marine biologists. Holt is also program manager 
of the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources program. 
</P>
<P>
It will take the Surveyor a month to reach Antarctica and another month to 
return. Most of the scientists will fly there to meet the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Data gathered during the three-month research effort will be turned over to the 
U.S. delegate to the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources. The convention is connected with the 1961 international Antarctic 
Treaty, in which a group of nations agreed to use Antarctica for peaceful, 
scientific exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of antarctic krill fisheries should include not only how much 
krill can be taken, but more importantly, where it can be taken," Holt said. 
"This is because heavy areas of krill concentrations are also home to vast 
numbers of the animals dependent on krill for survival." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Holt said, these same areas are the main target of krill 
fishermen. "Harvest of these krill . . . could impact the other animals as 
well," he said. A growing international fleet of krill-harvesting vessels is 
being drawn to Antarctica, where scientists have observed "super swarms" of 
krill that cover many square miles of ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists on board the Surveyor will use state-of-the-art equipment to measure 
krill populations. They hope to chart known krill populations in order to 
determine how krill harvesting affects the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Besides studying krill, Surveyor scientists will study the feeding habits of 
fur seals and penguins, species that consume large quantities of krill. They 
also will study the microscopic algae and plants that krill feed on.

   Once a place only for the penguin, adventurer and

visitor, increasing the danger to Earth's last pristine environment.
An Associated Press correspondent traveled to the Frozen Continent
recently and this is what he found.

   Like a monument to the end of
Antarctica's age of innocence, the Bahia Paraiso's badly gashed
orange hull rises out of ice-blue waters.
   Penguins calmly perch atop the overturned vessel, unaware of the
danger in thin oily sheen in the water around them. Most of the tens
of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that spilled out in the
shipwreck Jan. 28 has since evaporated, but more is slowly leaking.
   Times are changing at Earth's last frontier.
   Countries eager to stake or reinforce their claims to a slice of
the Frozen Continent are dispatching ships and aircraft, bulldozers
and amphibious trucks. With nationalistic fanfare, they are building
new bases and launching new research projects.
   During the austral summer, well-heeled tourists arrive by the
hundreds each week on cruise ships, supply vessels or military
transport planes contracted by specilized travel agencies. Even
private yachts and polar skiing expeditions are venturing into the
last place on Earth where no passport is needed.
   Accidents are happening, and in the case of the Bahia Paraiso
Antarctic wildlife paid the price. A host of legal, environmental
and highly political questions are surging up like the hazardous
icebergs in Antarctica's poorly charted seas.
   ``You're confronted daily with an ever-hastening chain of
events,'' Peter Wilkniss, polar programs chief for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, told a visiting
Associated Press correspondent at Palmer Station. The foundation
directs all U.S. research in Antarctica.
   Wilkniss advocates increased international regulation.
   ``There's nothing that prevents anyone from doing anything they
want,'' he said. ``I don't think we can live with that situation.''
   He described the continent's 5.1 million square miles as ``a
judicial no-man's land.''
   No laws apply to Antarctica because no one owns it, according to
the terms of the Antarctic Treaty. The pact was signed in 1961 by 12
countries who agreed to put all territorial claims on hold for at
least 30 years and reserve Antarctica for peaceful research.
   Eight other nations since have joined the treaty with full voting
powers, while an additional 18 have agreed to abide by its
provisions and hold observer status. The treaty nations meet about
every two years.
   The organization recently drafted a plan to permit strictly
regulated exploration and exploitation of the continent's mineral
resources after 1991, when the treaty itself is up for review.
   But it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as the
proliferation of bases, marine and air safety, indemnification, and
medical and rescue facilities.
   The wreck of the Bahia Paraiso exemplifies the region's
predicament.
   The 435-foot supply and research vessel, operated by the
Argentine navy, called on Palmer Station in glacier-rimmed Arthur
Bay on Jan. 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around.
It also carried a crew of 235.
   On its way out of the bay, it ran aground in a passage marked on
sea charts as containing ``danger ledges and pinnacles.'' Crew and
passengers got off safely in lifeboats and found shelter at the
station.
   The ship, over a period of four days, gradually rolled over and
sank. About 180,000 gallons of diesel oil from its storage tanks
spilled into the water.
   During the austral summer season, more than 30 cruises were
scheduled to call on Palmer, bringing an average 100 tourists on
each occasion.
   Tourism is uncontrolled and, to some, out of control.
   ``In 1982, we got three cruise ships all season,'' said Bruce
Carter of ITT-Antarctic Services, which is contracted to supply and
maintain Palmer Station. ``This year we got as many as five a week.
We'd sometimes get two in one day.''
   The Science Foundation briefly tried to ban tourist visits last
year, arguing that it interfered with research. But the ban was
lifted when influential Americans complained, claiming a right to
see how their tax dollars are being spent. The Bahia Paraiso's
tourists included 46 Americans who paid from $3,000 to nearly $7,000
for the cruise.
   The station's staff includes a medical corpsman with a small
one-room clinic for treating the two to four dozen people at the
base. It is not designed for handling a maritime disaster.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Travel: Warmed by the glories of the frozen continent -
Antarctica fires Nicholas Woodsworth's imagination

0748 hrs: arrive Cuverville Is. Position: Latitude 64 degs 41 mins South /
Longitude 62 degs. 37 mins West. Weather: Cloudy, 985 millibars. Temp: 2.50
air, - 0.50 sea. Wind: SW 4-5, sea calm.
Vessel drifting off NE of Cuverville Is. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3
humpback whales.
There is no getting around it - Peter Skog, chief officer and keeper of the
Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and
unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the 1990s? Or is there
simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another,
Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic.
Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and
bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as
six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the
moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded,
ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No
38 bus on to the Edgware Road. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek
at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me.
One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate
language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just
do the trick.
Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log
two days ago as we crossed the notorious Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the
Antarctic Peninsula. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the
least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and
anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and
porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace
 -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my
cabin bathroom.
Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the
charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise Drake, Magellan and Darwin,
all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise
Alex, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a
crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without
spilling a drop.
But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that Alex is
one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an
emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never
forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of
record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, Alex stands somewhere near
the top.
Sea temperature -0.50 Skog has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust
Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more
adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went
swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I,
who knew the secret of volcanic Pendulum Cove and its sand beach,
geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great
steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing?
Skog might not be impressed, but I was. Pendulum Cove gave me a better bath
than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in London.
Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes Skog, as if
compiling a shopping list for Sainsbury's supermarket. But I can tell you
that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying
pesto sauce or coffee beans.
In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds
and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a
penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards.
Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and
cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly
fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French
waiters, but are far more approachable.
Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200
yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a
contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors
lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match
rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative,
testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for
the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in
my favourite local on a busy Saturday night.
But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for
the whales. Skog can write 3 humpback whales and let it go at that if he
likes. When you are in a Zodiac inflatable dingy and close enough to be
drenched in the fine spray from a whale's blow-hole it is rather a different
matter. There is nothing quite like the company of these vast animals as
they lazily dive and spout and roll and wave their flippers and raise their
flukes. Melville wrote hundreds of pages about the great drama between men
and whales; you would think the miserable Skog might manage more than three
words. But no.
1145 hrs: arrive Neumeyer Channel. Position: a spectacular channel, narrow
and high sided, grander than any northern fjord. Weather: marvellous -
crystal clear air, gloriously sunny, fresh and bracing - the kind of weather
that makes you feel happy to be alive. Sea: full of blue curacao-coloured
icebergs.
Vessel crunching through jig-saw puzzle pack ice, surrounded by snow-covered
mountains plunging steeply to the sea.
Could Skog be be responsible for such a loose and fanciful entry? Of course
not. Skog wrote nothing at this point. I have written it for him. The chief
officer, apparently, does not believe breathtaking beauty worthy of
recording. But while he enjoys measuring millibars, the rest of us enjoyed
gazing out from the upper deck at some of the most astounding scenery we
have ever seen - great ice cliffs, impossibly tall and pointed peaks,
glaciers flowing at infinitesimal speed into the sea, weirdly sculpted
icebergs, seals basking on sun-washed ice-floes.
We were all impressed, and this is saying something, for the passengers
aboards the Explorer - wealthy, well-travelled, and for the most part
American - have high expectations. For my own part, I had no idea that such
a continent existed - in my mind Antarctica was a bleak, desolate and
lifeless place of little interest. On the contrary, it is now for me a place
of the greatest interest.
1500 hrs: arrive Port Lockroy. Position: Lat: 64 degs 52 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: partly cloudy, 982 millibars. Temp. 50 air, 00 sea. Sea calm.
Vessel drifting off Port Lockroy. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals.
Back to dull Skog's ditch-water delivery again. Does he never tire? Has he
never stood on the rocks, surrounded by hundreds of clamorsome, roosting
shags, and looked down into the waters of Port Lockroy as I did?
How striking it is to watch penguins, slapstick, waddling, inept birds on
land, transform themselves into marvels of dynamic design in the water. With
just one hop from a rock they become agile, graceful creatures, as fast as
torpedoes as they flash about in search of the fish and shrimp-like krill
that is their prey.
One moment of marine game-watching in Port Lockroy remains with me: that
instant when, on a drifting ice-floe not five yards distant, a snoozing
leopard seal awoke and yawned, showing me a great mouthful of needle-sharp
teeth, then slipped silently into the water. There is nothing furry or cute
about leopard seals - they can flay a penguin right out of its skin with a
few tosses of their powerful heads. The moment that seal slid below the
surface, the hunters became the hunted.
But does Skog appreciate the thrill of the wild, the vitality of life, the
inevitability of sudden death? Gentoo penguins, leopard seals is all he can
find to write. But then Swedes have always been a squeamish lot when it
comes to high drama. In their country I have seen dairy cows with rubber
bulbs fitted to their horns in order that they cause no undue harm or
excitement. Poor Skog, perhaps he should not be blamed.
2000 hrs: arrive Paradise Bay. Position: Lat: 65 degs 42 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: overcast, 984 millibars. Temp: 0.50 air, 00 water.
Vessel drifting off Paradise Bay. BBQ, then Zodiac tours, landing on the
Antarctic continent.
All is forgiven] In that last sentence taken from the log today I detect a
tiny soupcon, the merest hint of understanding, of what it is to be Man the
Explorer. But it is enough. Until now, the fourth of 10 days of cruising, we
have only visited islands lying off the coast of Antarctica. This evening we
land on the continent itself, and Skog has recognised the heroic symbolism
of that act. A literary milestone.
If there is any doubt as to the significance of the event, there is, as the
chief officer notes, to be a magnificent outdoor meal served on the rear
deck, with a penguin - even now being chiselled in ice by a skilled Filipino
chef - as the centrepiece to our blithe, mulled-wine-swilling company.
And if that is not enough, the captain is up on the bridge at this moment
preparing a Certificate of Antarctic Exploration for each of us. We have
'joined the ranks of Scott and Shackleton', it informs us, 'and ventured to
set foot on Antarctica, the biggest, coldest, driest, windiest, loneliest,
most remote and least-known continent on earth'. Not only that, but we are
now dedicated to 'honour the brave pioneer Antarctic explorers who sailed
these frozen seas before us, and to protect the Antarctic Continent for
those who will follow'.
That is certainly quite a big mouthful for one small step, even if it is on
to Antarctica. No matter how much the chief officer has loosened up, I am
sure he would not approve of the tone of such a document - could that be why
he has left the captain alone on the bridge and is down here with us
munching BBQ? It is simply not his style.
Nicholas Woodsworth sailed to Antarctica with Abercrombie and Kent, Sloane
Square House, Holbein Place, London SW1, tel 071-730 9600. A+K's 10-12 day
Antarctic cruises, combining visits to the Falklands and / or South Georgia,
begin at Pounds 3,996, inclusive of return air fare from London. He flew to
Santiago, originating point of the expedition, with British Airways.

The Argentine navy said Friday nearly all the fuel drums thrown into the 
Antarctic Ocean by a shipwreck have been recovered and no more oil slicks are 
visible, but American officials disputed that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The excursion vessel Bahia Paraiso, piloted by an Argentine navy crew, hit a 
rock and partially sank on Jan. 28 after leaving the U.S. National Science 
Foundation's Palmer research station. 
</P>
<P>
The 350 people on board, many of them tourists, were evacuated, but penguins, 
gulls and shrimp-like krill were endangered by the estimated 180,000 gallons of 
oil that leaked from the ship's fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of the drums of gas-oil (diesel fuel) that the ship had on 
its deck has been recovered," an Argentine navy statement said. "Yesterday, oil 
slicks on the surface were not visible." 
</P>
<P>
But Winifred Reuning, a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation's polar 
programs, said, "There is still fuel in the water that can be seen. It's not 
all cleaned up. However, there are no significant leaks from the ship any more 
-- that's plugged up."

   Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature
reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched
under ice.
   The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than
United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim
slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a
vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.
   But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon
whether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,
commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.
   In Paris, beginning Monday, 33 nations will review the 1959
Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the
remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.
   The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil
exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one
of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are
pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's
concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.
   Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988
convention took six years to negotiate.
   Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.
Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other
strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the
billions of barrels.
   Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably
pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its
delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can
predict.
   Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are
tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters
pristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.
   ``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle in
Antarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau once
told The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''
   In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit
the last untamed place on earth.
   ``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.
``It would be a catastrophe.''
   Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach
10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace
ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.
   Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely
unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it
such a disputed prize.
   Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white
continent than Africa is a dark one.
   Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.
   Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.
   For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for a
world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June
meeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that
are in danger. It's the entire Earth.''
   Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.
   For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's
thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
   A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much more serious than previously believed.
   Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites
calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earth
spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and
melting ice.
   Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds
and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny
shrimp.
   In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,
accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is
very difficult to correct.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: ANTARCTIC TREATY THREATENS CONTINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There exists a vast, eternally white continent where life clings to the borders 
of death. There the icy air is light to the lungs and offers magical 
transparency to the sight. The hours of bewitching quietness and of total sun 
are swept away by raging blizzards that spare intruders only by chance. 
</P>
<P>
This immense austral land is buried under mountains of snow, piled up and 
frozen over the course of tens of millions of years. Fossils, the vestiges of 
important chapters in our planet's history, sleep under their immaculate 
shroud. All around circles a silent carrousel of giant icebergs that have been 
torn from the shores, and dwarf lichens sprinkle the coast ice with hesitant 
spots of color. A fringe of salty ice protrudes, then disappears with seasons, 
while on land soft ice melts only to better solidify. 
</P>
<P>
The sea sometimes reddens with clouds of tiny shrimp -- krill -- on which 
penguins, whales and, indirectly, seals stuff themselves in order to survive. 
The seals move about under the pack ice while singing eerie melodies; a fish -- 
the icefish -- injects proteins as antifreeze into its colorless blood; the 
orcas, endowed with majestic fins, blend their breath with the morning mist. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica, continent at the bottom of the world, has shown us its fragile 
state, which is due to the extreme simplicity of its ecosystems. But the 
forbidding rigor of its environment did not discourage some territorial claims 
that the 1959 Antarctic treaty has thus far managed to include. The document, 
signed by 12 nations and now honored by 26 others, ensures the demilitarization 
of Antarctica and lays great stress on its use for scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Already whales have been hunted, and more recent tentative agreements 
(particularly that of April 7, 1982) have begun opening the way to industrial 
fishing for krill. Such hypocritical infringements on the spirit that 
enthusiastically gave birth to the Antarctic treaty -- namely the willingness 
to preserve the last wilderness zone on our planet -- caused us to sound a 
first cry of alarm in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, this time, masks have fallen. Representatives of 33 countries, assembled 
in Wellington, New Zealand, have, after six years of difficult negotiations, 
signed an agreement that opens the entire Antarctic continent to a so-called 
controlled exploitation of its mining resources: coal, uranium, gold and oil. 
</P>
<P>
The document even specifies that prospecting by means of seismic explosion of a 
"reasonable magnitude" is permitted. The cold? The ice? It will be difficult? 
It will be costly? What does it matter!? Since it is possible, exult the 
technocrats, it will be done! What? Dust from coal and smoke from oil torches 
are going to alter the protective whiteness of the surface, the albedo of the 
entire continent? The ice may melt; the sea may rise several dozen feet and 
engulf most of our cities? Come, come now! More ecologists' tales! 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. We need only take the example of the Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine 
supply ship that ran aground in January off Palmer Station, a crucial U.S. 
scientific base. The diesel-fuel cargo leaked slowly, over a matter of days, 
but 20 years of scientific research was compromised before clean-up vessels 
could even reach the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-coated seabirds and smothered plankton -- microscopic sea creatures being 
studied in experiments to gauge how increased ultraviolet sunlight will effect 
the ocean surface. Accidental pollution had finally stained the laboratory of 
Antarctica. It was a "minor" oil spill, authorities said, but the local 
consequences to the fragile ecosystem will take years, if ever, to recoup. 
</P>
<P>
If an innocent ship with an innocent purpose can cause potential catastrophe, 
what of mining operations? Are we naive enough to believe that miners will put 
on white coats and brush their feet before they unleash their industrial 
maelstrom? 
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the entire world, be on the alert! The Wellington Agreement is 
nothing more than a holdup on a planetary scale. It involves the smashing open 
of the safe that contains the most fantastic treasure: the last water reserve 
that cannot be controlled if it is set free. The hostages: seals, birds, 
penguins, whales. Threatened is the whole of humankind whose conscience in 
managing the future of our planet risks being sacrificed to the cult of a 
meaningless golden calf. 
</P>
<P>
The scrap of paper signed in Wellington will be applied when 16 of the 20 
voting members of the 1959 treaty ratify it. We must at all costs oppose this 
ratification in the name of future generations.

In December, 1972, I disembarked from Calypso onto Antarctica for the first 
time. A serene sun shone upon the dusting of snow which had fallen during the 
night. With my heart beating excitedly, I took my first steps. The crackling of 
my boots in the soft powder made me look back. My footprints, soiled with a bit 
of grease, contrasted with the blinding whiteness of everything that surrounded 
me. Naively, I blushed with shame for not having cleaned the soles of my shoes.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Vast Population of Plants, Animals in Polar Ice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vast and previously undiscovered population
of tiny plants and animals lives in hollowed pores carved through
the sea ice that forms annually around Antarctica, researchers said
in studies released Sunday.
   Cornelius Sullivan, co-leader of a National Science Foundation
polar study expedition, said scientists studying the sea ice found
large and thriving populations of krill, a small shrimp-like
animal, grazing on one-celled plants and animals that live in the
ice pores.
   ``The sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energy
the krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland,''
said Sullivan, the director of marine biological research at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
   Existence of the vast population of plants and animals living in
the ice came as a surprise to researchers who spent 70 days during
the heart of the Antarctic winter studying the polar ice.
   During the winter, sea water freezes to a six-foot thickness and
forms a pack extending 1,100 miles from the Antarctic mainland. The
total ice formed around the South Pole continent is roughly 11
million square miles, three times the area of the United States.
   Each spring, 80 percent of the ice melts, creating a
nutrient-rich layer of water that is filled with small plants and
animals, and with the birds and mammals that feed on them.
   But the amount of life that existed within the ice during the
winter months was an unanticipated discovery, said Sullivan in a
telephone interview.
   He said the scientists found that the sea ice was not solid, but
was pocked with channels, ``rather like Swiss cheese.'' These
channels form as hairlike pores when the ice freezes and then are
enlarged by wave action, said Sullivan.
   Once the channels are in place, they form a home for one-celled
plants called algae that live in the microscopic spaces between the
ice crystals.
   Sullivan said the algae is ``remarkable'' because it is able to
perform photosynthesis in temperatures at or below freezing.
Sunlight strikes the ice five to six hours a day in the winter and
enough of the light penetrates the ice to allow the algae to grow.
   The ice algae, he said, has adapted to the frigid temperatures
and will ``fall apart'' if allowed to warm to typical room
temperatures.
   Once the algae has bloomed in the ice, Sullivan said, the pores
in the ice surface becomes home to bacteria, protozoans and
amoebas, many of which feed on the algae. The krill, free swimming
from the ocean, then make their way into the channels and feed on
the other small ice creatures.
   Divers, exploring the ice from below, were able to probe the ice
channels and bring out samples of the life there.
   ``Almost all of the krill we found were in larval or juvenile
stages, which gives us the idea that the krill are using the ice as
a giant nursery for early development stages,'' said Sullivan.
   Some studies indicate that the ice pack around Antarctica may be
shrinking because the Earth is slowly warming. If this is true,
said Sullivan, it could have an impact on krill, which is a key
animal in the polar ecosystem.
   Adult krill live in vast schools and are a favorite food of
whale, penguin and seal.
   ``Krill is a key species that others depend on,'' said Sullivan.
A decline in the krill population could affect the populations of
other animals, he said, ``because they are obviously all linked.''

   King penguins at a rookery on a nearby
island stampeded, killing 7,000 of the birds, and officials said
Sunday they were investigating the mysterious occurrence.
   ``We don't know at this stage why they stampeded _ we have not
observed this type of behavior before,'' a spokesman for the
Australian State Parks Wildlife and Heritage Ministry said on
condition of anonymity.
   The stampede occurred on Macquarie Island, which is midway
between Australia and Antarctica and part of Tasmania, an
Australian state.
   The parks spokesman said about 6,000 chicks and 800 to 1,000
adults were found dead about three weeks ago on the island.
   ``There was no one in the area at the time, and we have ruled
out earthquakes,'' he said. ``There is a lot of seismic activity on
Macquarie Island, but there was no activity on that day.''
   Macquarie Island's Lusitiana Bay is home to hundreds of
thousands of birds and the site of one of the world's biggest king
penguin rookeries.

said.  </TEXT>

   Volunteers today began rescuing
penguins from an oil slick along the southeastern coast of
Australia that has already killed more than 100 of the birds.
   Schoolchildren joined in the effort to find dead or injured
birds along a 150-mile stretch of coastline of Victoria state.
   Fifty-six of the oil-covered penguins, close to death, were
being cared for at a special rescue center, said Kris Reinertson,
head ranger of the Otway Range National Park.
   An investigation was under way to find the ship responsible for
the six-mile-long oil slick, which has largely broken up in the
heavy seas since it was first sighted Monday, the Port of Melbourne
Authority said.
   The slick spread through major feeding grounds for the penguins,
which can swim up to 180 miles a day in search of food.

<HEAD>50 Penguins Found Dead in Hold of Taiwanese Trawler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of 50 endangered
penguins were found floating in the flooded hold of a Taiwanese
fishing trawler that ran aground, environmental officials said.
   The carcasses of the Jackass penguins had been individually
packaged in plastic bags, the officials said Friday.
   The fishing trawler An Hung ran aground on the rocky
southwestern coast of South Africa early Tuesday, and 15
crewmembers were rescued by helicopter. One was found dead on the
beach Tuesday.
   The Jackass penguin is unique to the southern African coast and
is protected under South African law. Its population has diminished
after centuries of being hunted.
   Its natural habitat has been diminished by fishing and the
collection of the guano the bird uses to build its nests.

   Man on the frozen continent requires steady supply. The fauna is
all but inedible. Even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast.
The plants are minuscule lichens. And what comes in must be carried
out.
   Travelers today find Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's hut as he left
it in 1911, with unrusted tins of Huntley &amp; Palmer's biscuits lined
up on dust-free shelves. Cold, clean air preserves almost anything.
   Environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany a
lengthening string of military and scientific outposts, including
the sprawling U.S. McMurdo Station.
   The Greenpeace environmentalist group set up a base near McMurdo
to monitor developments. Its members came to blows with French
soldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near the
South Magnetic Pole.
   The group accuses the Americans, among others, of killing marine
life with sewage and refuse. If scientists cannot protect the
environment, Greenpeace argues, oilmen and miners will be worse.
   Near the end of September, word filtered out that 44,000 gallons
of diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott
Station at the South Pole. The leak was discovered in August.
   U.S. officials said it would seep into the ice with no
environmental damage. But Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of
Australia called it a perfect example of why Antarctica had to be
protected.
   In the early 1970s, when politics heated in Antarctica, claimant
nations hurried to strengthen their positions.
   Argentina leased a Greek ship, with deck chairs but no radar,
for cut-rate tourism. Chile built a hotel. Last year, the first
commercial flights landed at the South Pole.
   Now Australian entrepreneurs propose ``Project Oasis'' _ a
runway for 747 jet aircraft, a five-story hotel and a hovercraft
dock.
   When the mineral convention was signed, some specialists argued
that controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all. If
anyone broke the moratorium, no international law would apply.
   Ideas included carrying out oil in submarines, rather than
tankers, to minimize risk.
   But the picture changed in January when an Argentine supply
ship, the Bahia Paraiso, nosed into waters marked on charts
``dangerous ledges and channels'' and tore open its double hull.
   The crew and all 81 tourists escaped, but an estimated 170,000
gallons of its 250,000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marine
habitats, eventually killing seals, penguins and other marine life.
   Salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil still
remains in the ship's tanks.
   The Argentine navy reported after a reconnaissance flight over
the area in early September that the Bahia Paraiso is still aground
in ice-free waters and listing at about 140 degrees.
   Capt. Raul Pueyrredon of the Argentine navy said the airmen
``saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage.''
   He added that he was not sure how much oil remained in the
vessel but that ``it was very little.''
   In a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in
May, the Environmental Defense Fund, an American organization that
describes itself as non-profit, said the Bahia Paraiso still had
about 70,000 gallons of fuel on board when the Southern Hemisphere
winter set in and still poses a threat to Antarctica's environment.
   ``Antarctica's worst environmental disaster has become a
forgotten oil spill,'' the letter said.

<TEXT>
   More ultraviolet light suppresses marine
productivity in the Antarctic, according to findings of new
research on the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&amp;M University said Tuesday his findings
could mean the existence of a threat to the krill, a tiny
shrimp-like creature on which all Antarctic life depends directly
or indirectly.
   If the krill goes, ``the whole ecosystem probably would
collapse,'' and the whales, seals, penguins, birds and fish would
disappear, he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the World
Resources Institute, a Washington environmental policy research
institute that has called attention to ozone problems.
   The ozone layer high above the earth thins by about half over
Antarctica each spring, letting more ultraviolet light reach the
ground. If this happened over the globe as a whole, the
Environmental Protection Agency says, each 1 percent decline in
ozone would mean a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation and
a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin
cancer.
   The krill, which are an inch or two long, feed on phytoplankton,
which are invisible to the naked eye. Fish and marine mammals in
turn feed on the krill.
   A 10 percent harvest of the 550 million to 770 million tons of
protein represented by the krill could equal the entire fish catch
of the world, and several nations are studying use of such a
protein resource.
   El-Sayed and his students at an island near Palmer Station
labeled test tanks of southern ocean water containing
phytoplankton, the ``grass of the sea,'' with radioactive calcium
carbonate.
   The radioactivity of the plankton after taking up the carbon
isotope is a measure of photosynthesis, the process by which plants
live, deriving energy from sunlight.
   Samples to which extra ultraviolet had been added showed far
less radioactivity: 1,000 counts per minute on a scintillation
counter as opposed to 15,000 counts per minute for the sample from
which all ultraviolet had been excluded.
   The extra ultraviolet was about 6.5 percent of what was already
in the light. On the day the measurements were made, ozone overhead
was only about 80 percent of normal, so the light was already
presumably enriched in ultraviolet.
   Ultraviolet reaching the ground in Antarctica is not as much as
it would be elsewhere under the same ozone layer. The sun is low in
the sky and its light travels a long slant distance through the
ozone.
   Scientists attribute the Antarctic ozone hole, and a newly
discerned average 2.3 percent year-round ozone decline in northern
mid-latitudes since 1969, to man-made chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons. Major producing nations agreed in Montreal
last year to a 50 percent cut in production by 1998, and last week
du Pont Co. said it planned to stop manufacture.
   Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, told reporters Tuesday that in light of the mid-latitude
decline, he would seek to accelerate the scientific review called
for by the treaty so that participating nations could consider
further production cuts when 1990 opens.
   But Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate,
subject of a hearing today, calling for an early 95 percent cut in
U.S. production.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer with 25 years of experience in
the Antarctic, was supported in his work last fall on Anvers Island
near Palmer Station by the National Science Foundation.

<TEXT>
   A huge cargo plane
that arose from the Antarctic ice like a frozen phoenix after being
buried in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base Saturday.
   ``Today we are celebrating a triumph: a triumph of technology, a
triumph of knowledge and skill, and a triumph of courage,'' National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge said after the LC-130
Hercules and its nine-member crew landed.
   Lockheed engineers and Navy personnel worked in subfreezing cold,
heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound,
40-ton aircraft. The 98-foot-long plane was flown out of the crash
site in January 1988 and was renovated in Christchurch, New Zealand.
   The LC-130 returned to its hangar at the Navy's Antarctic
Development Squadron 6, the ``Puckered Penguins'' who fly seven
cargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polar
missions.
   The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site
about 700 miles from McMurdo Sound, the U.S. ice station on the
Antarctic, after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski and
nose.
   The aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and has
one-ton, Teflon-coated ``wheel-skis'' to break the grip of ice on
takeoff.
   The loss of the Hercules hurt the foundation's ability to conduct
field research in Antarctica, foundation officials have said.
   A salvage crew worked in minus 30-degree temperatures, heavy snow
and 20-knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft, repair it
and fly it out. All but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot-high
tail had been buried in snow.
   The plane was made by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. in
Marietta, Ga. Lockheed engineers involved in the salvage found many
hydraulic and electronics systems still working after the long
hibernation.
   There was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks,
apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polar
climate.
   Foundation officials say about $4.2 million was spent to excavate
and overhaul the plane. The estimated cost of a replacement plane is
$35 million.

birds. "We don't know where they're coming from.";    The birds -- known as
common murres -- nest on the Farallon Islands. They resemble miniature
penguins, with black and white coloring.;    Authorities had no immediate
estimate of how many of the birds were dead and how many alive. Holcomb,
however, estimated that about 20 to 25 birds had washed ashore daily since
last Wednesday.;    "So far, we've had about 11," said Melissa Mills, a
spokeswoman for Monterey Wildlife Society. "Some are dead, some are alive. By
the time we get them, they're in pretty bad shape.";    Holcomb said the birds
had been washing ashore at a rate of two or three daily during November before
the pace picked up. Most of the birds have been found along the San Mateo
County coast.;    International Bird Rescue attempts to give the birds water
and wash them while coaxing them back to health.;    While a Coast Guard
spokesman cautioned that the source of the oil had not been determined, he
said it was not unusual for ships to empty bilge oil at sea to save expense.; 
  The Coast Guard maintains a computerized data base of oil samples that
allows comparison with a ship's bilge oil, sometimes years after a spill.  </TEXT>

Yet the somber memories of the wreck last year, and the oil it spilled within 
sight of a premier U.S. research station, endure as forceful symbols of the 
hazards posed by the growing human presence in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 315 tourists and crew of the Bahia Paraiso survived and the spill 
was minor by most standards, the accident gave new impetus to a movement to 
respect this continent not only as a place of forbidding beauty but also as a 
fragile reservoir ensuring the Earth's health. 
</P>
<P>
That has meant, in part, cleaning up the unsightly mess that developed in 
recent decades from Antarctic exploration itself. But more broadly, it has 
encouraged a changing mentality toward tourism, research methods and 
exploitation. The broken hulk also has reminded the world of the need to 
preserve Antarctica as a uniquely shared and still-untainted laboratory for 
understanding the planet's seas and skies. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 nations that make up the Antarctic Treaty organization are working with 
renewed energy on tougher rules to govern activities in the region. And some 
countries are rebelling against an already strict 1988 agreement to govern oil 
drilling and mineral mining, arguing instead for an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, is 
removing the junk heaps that scar its three permanent bases and is hauling 
shiploads of rubble back north. Even before the Bahia Paraiso sank, an 
additional $8.3 million was budgeted for environmental and safety projects this 
year. Cleaner sewer systems are being installed, environmental impact programs 
are under review and emergency plans for oil spills are being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Antarctica was approached in an expeditionary way," said Gary 
Staffo, recently named as the National Science Foundation's polar safety and 
environmental officer. "It was seen as a one-time shot: 'We'll go do the 
mission and get the people back and leave the trash behind.' Certainly that is 
no longer acceptable -- and that is progress. There are greater expectations 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Bahia Paraiso means Paradise Bay in Spanish, and that would have been an apt 
name for the place where the ship foundered on rocks on Jan. 28, 1989, spilling 
about 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Elephant seals nuzzle noisily on a rocky island beach, adelie and chinstrap 
penguins totter about, tiny limpets browse in the tidal basins and swarms of 
shrimp-like krill bloom in springtime, hearty meals for the whales. 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, blue-white glacial ice cliffs rise hundreds of feet out of the 
sea. The silence gives way to explosions as vast slabs break away and slide 
into the water -- the "calving" of icebergs from the ice shelf that covers 98% 
of the continent and is up to three miles thick near the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Antarctica is a place for science. In recent years, the research has 
taken on urgency as knowledge emerges of the environmental damage caused by 
industrial-era pollution and its potential impact on the whole planet. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects take advantage of the still-unspoiled seas and skies, with 
constant winter nights and crystal summer days, to pursue cutting-edge studies 
of phenomena such as cosmic rays and radiation belts. 
</P>
<P>
And some scientists are finding a world startlingly abloom in what seems at 
first such a bleak and lifeless place, fresh proof of the continent's crucial 
role in the world's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers David Karl of the University of Hawaii and Mark Huntley of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, for example, are charting a 
phenomenal mass of life in the Gerlache Strait along the Antarctic Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
From the pitching deck of the primary U.S. research ship the Polar Duke, Karl 
sends an electronic pulse into the water, setting off a small explosion. That 
frees a titanium frame holding a ring of 13 plastic bottles, and the device 
floats up hundreds of feet to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
All hands scan the choppy waters until Robert H. Rutford, president of the 
University of Texas at Dallas and a veteran polar hand, spies the yellow buoys 
astern. The ship's winch painstakingly recovers the experiment. Karl helps pull 
aboard the frame and its harvest: five months' worth of organic sediment, much 
of it excrement from luxuriant swarms of krill shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
The "catch" is neatly divided into 11-day samples captured by the 
computer-driven ring of revolving bottles attached to the bottom of a plastic 
funnel. Some are near empty, but a couple, recording the height of the "bloom," 
are nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year project, costing $600,000 this year, recorded a rise in the 
strait's biomass this summer "to a higher level than ever found before in any 
ocean," said Karl, who has visited Antarctica seven times since 1976. "In the 
winter, this water is essentially a biological desert. But in the spring, we 
are finding that it blooms into a biological garden." 
</P>
<P>
The study also will help analyze aspects of the "greenhouse effect" of global 
warming, thought to be caused by a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere. As the plant biomass of the Gerlache Strait grows and absorbs 
carbon dioxide, that may allow the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere and, in effect, serve as "a self-regulating mechanism that helps 
keep us from totally ruining the environment," Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntley, a partner in the program known as RACER (Research on Antarctic Coastal 
Ecosystem Rates), said the project has shown the strait to be 10 times richer 
than the nutrient-filled fishing grounds off Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica, known simply as "The Ice" by old hands, contains 70% of the world's 
fresh water, and the cold currents welling from its shores are apparently an 
engine for the world's seas. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got here is a biological pump," Huntley said. "The Gerlache is 
seething with life. And if you've got a rich resource like this that depends on 
a small locale, then you'd better be careful with it. It could be an incredibly 
important nursing ground." 
</P>
<P>
In a climate with winter temperatures as low as 128.6 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit and where psychological tests are required for those who plan to 
"winter over," Ph.D. degrees don't suffice; scientists need ingenuity, 
teamwork, stamina and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
When he sent the frame back to the bottom for another eight-month sampling, 
Karl resorted to an unlikely anchor: an old boiler taken from the junk heap at 
Palmer Station. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica is so harsh an environment that it defies the ambitions of any 
single nation, and nowhere in the world has international cooperation been so 
extensive. The RACER program's 23 scientists come from seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
"With colleagues from India to Germany, you get a whole different conceptual 
perspective," Huntley said. "One has the sense of constantly being fertilized. 
. . . A lot of the geopolitical nonsense falls away, and the human aspects 
prevail. The common denominator is scientific research." 
</P>
<P>
That fits the treaty's declaration: "It is in the interest of all mankind that 
Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes 
and shall not become the scene or object of international discord." 
</P>
<P>
The mean annual temperature in the interior of the continent is 70 degrees 
below zero Fahrenheit. But along the Antarctic Peninsula jutting up toward the 
tip of South America, the summer temperatures rise above freezing. That gives 
rise to names like the "Banana Belt" and the "Antarctic Riviera" in a region of 
majestic fiords and, between the outsized glaciers, much of the 2% of open 
ground not covered by ice on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula is just two days by sea across the fearsome Drake Passage or a 
two-hour flight aboard a C-130 Hercules to the Chilean airstrip at Teniente 
Marsh Base on King George Island, making it accessible to scientists and a 
steadily growing number of tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
The island is home to eight permanent research bases and also to the only hotel 
in Antarctica, run by the Chilean military. Calling it Spartan is generous; the 
hotel looks and feels like an elongated shipping container raised off the 
barren ground beside the gravel landing strip, with a few cubicles off the 
narrow hallway for people boarding ships in the bay for tours or transiting to 
bases farther south. 
</P>
<P>
The Bahia Paraiso was among several ships that call at Palmer Station, on 
Anvers Island halfway down the peninsula. About 2,500 tourists made the trip 
this season, up from 822 in 1983. A couple of tour ships plan to visit McMurdo 
Station next year, the largest U.S. base, located on the opposite side of the 
continent on the much colder Ross Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country skiers, an airborne tour group and a cross-continent dog sled 
expedition have also called at the third U.S. base, Amundsen-Scott at the South 
Pole, during the last two summers. 
</P>
<P>
Groups like the Environmental Defense Fund cite the Bahia Paraiso sinking in 
demanding far stricter rules for tourism, including a ban on helicopter flights 
and boat landings within 1,500 meters (about one mile) of wildlife sites and an 
outright ban of any ship waste disposal in the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, openly 
discourages tourism and last year enacted regulations to control tourist 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Carol A. Roberts, deputy director of the National Science Foundation's division 
of polar programs, cited three concerns: the impact of tourists on scientific 
work, especially during disruptive visits to the stations; the tourists' impact 
on the environment, underscored by the Argentine shipwreck, and the cost of 
search and rescue. Palmer Station sacrificed most of its research season last 
year to care for the Bahia Paraiso survivors and coordinate the cleanup and 
analysis of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Nascent adventure tourism on the dangerous mainland, she said, threatens to 
cause even greater problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who handles logistics for Antarctica, noted that the budget for 
getting to and working in the region is greater than the science budget itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last place on Earth; it's almost like going to the moon in a 
logistical sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards were apparent on a recent trip by scientists setting out on a range 
of expeditions, accompanied by NSF staffers evaluating environment and safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The C-130 flight from Chile descended through clouds toward the airstrip in 
35-knot crosswinds, just below the landing limit of 37 knots. The New York Air 
National Guard pilot fought to keep the wallowing, yawing plane on course and 
slammed it down on the airstrip. Parked, the plane shuddered in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
A choppy, wet ride aboard rubber Zodiac rafts with outboard motors brought the 
group to the Polar Duke, the workhorse U.S. Antarctic research ship. The 
219-foot, ice-strengthened vessel serves as both transport to Palmer Station 
and platform for some of the complex oceanographic studies that form the heart 
of the NSF's $151-million annual Antarctic research program. 
</P>
<P>
The new Norwegian captain, Tor-Arne Jakobsen, brought the ship into Palmer two 
days later on a stormy night in a punishing 45-knot wind, down from the 
66-knot, hurricane-force winds the previous day at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the approximately 4,000 people who work each year in Antarctica, 
Jakobsen had long sought the chance to be there. His father was captain of an 
expedition there in 1950, and Jakobsen himself had sailed seven times to the 
Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The charts Jakobsen used clearly showed the rocks struck by the Bahia Paraiso. 
The Argentine charts apparently did not. Treaty countries are working now to 
bring all charts used in the area up to date. 
</P>
<P>
Staffo, the environmental officer who previously worked for NASA, cited a 
number of other new safety measures. The NSF is testing devices to be carried 
on expeditions that could be tracked by satellite, instantly pinpointing a 
group's location. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. focus is on the environment, especially waste disposal. 
Macerators, which grind up sewage, were installed at Palmer and McMurdo 
stations this year; the "gray water" is still pumped into the bays. Palmer, a 
small station with just 40 residents in the summer, no longer burns its waste 
but rather "retrogrades" it, jargon for shipping it back north. McMurdo, a much 
larger center of more than 1,000 in summer, still burns waste every other 
Sunday morning, a sore point for Greenpeace and other activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jorgensen, Palmer's contract manager, said 10 containers of refuse had 
been shipped back this year, and a chartered ship had hauled away tons of junk 
from the abandoned Old Palmer Station, across Arthur Harbor. Several years' 
worth of old low-grade radioactive and dangerous waste was also sent back. 
</P>
<P>
A priority, Staffo said, is to get suppliers to remove all plastics and excess 
packing material before the goods are shipped. "It's much easier to deal with 
it in the States than once it gets out on the ice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. program suffered its own fuel spill this season when 10,000 to 12,000 
gallons of oil spilled from old rubber fuel bladders at the airfield near 
McMurdo, Staffo said. Since then, those bladders have been replaced with steel 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Palmer last year could do little more than watch as the Bahia 
Paraiso oil slick spread into nearby tidal coves and beyond. It took six days 
for emergency crews to arrive with oil booms and other gear. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60,000 gallons of fuel is still aboard the overturned vessel, but 
NSF projects the cost at $60 million to remove the wreck. So it will remain in 
its grave on a reef off DeLaca Island. American scientist Ted DeLaca was 
working at Palmer at the time and watched the ship founder on the island named 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, a scientist from Texas A&amp;M University, was 
returning to Palmer for a year-later analysis of the spill's impact. An 
emergency team analysis conducted after the spill, whose results are to be 
published in the May edition of Environmental Science and Technology magazine, 
basically found that the bay made a quick recovery after the initial kill-off 
of thousands of limpets and other invertebrates and about 300 birds. 
</P>
<P>
The pounding of the surf and winds apparently helped cleanse the area within a 
few weeks, Kennicutt said, but he now wants to see whether oil sediment that 
penetrated the shoreline has caused longer-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group found a very low population of microbes, "proof of how 
pristine the area is, since microbes thrive with pollution." He will study 
whether the microbes, which degrade hydrocarbons, have increased as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"The spill showed up the potential problem of tourism as the number of people 
in the area increases. It's unfortunate, but it gave us a laboratory framework 
to test the magnitude of a spill in such an area," he said. "But for other 
scientists who have been assessing the natural processes, to have this man-made 
event introduced throws all the years of data into doubt."

<TEXT>
   Workers have cleaned up most of the oil
spilled into Antarctic waters from a sunken Argentine ship, but the
accident wiped out a colony of baby birds that scientists were
studying, officials said Friday.
   Lt. Jose Araya of the Chilean navy said the oil leak from the
ship was stopped after divers patched the damaged hull of the
vessel, the Bahia Paraiso.
   But a National Science Foundation official at the Palmer Station,
a U.S. Antarctic research facility near where the ship ran aground
on Jan. 28, said the oil that spill from the vessel has wiped out a
colony of skua chicks.
   Bernhard Lettau, program manager for polar ocean sciences for the
foundation, said the oil killed all but six chicks in a rookery of
53 nests. The skua is a predator bird related to the seagull.
   ``In another two days, we expect the remaining chicks also to be
dead,'' Lettau said by conference call to reporters in Washington.
   The deaths of the birds means that no chicks will be produced
this year from a rookery that American scientists have studied for
years on the Antarctic peninsula, about 600 miles from the tip of
South America.
   Lettau also said two seals examined seemed to be having
difficulty breathing, some dead gulls were found and mortality has
been ``very high'' among limpids and sponges living near beaches
touched by the fuel oil.
   American scientists are still evaluating the oil spill and ``the
total effect is not yet known,'' he said.
   Thomas Forehand, ocean project manager for the National Science
Foundation, said it is doubtful that the Argentine vessel can be
refloated because its damage is so great. It is hoped that it can be
it cut apart and removed, he said.
   Officials are worried about removing the remaining fuel oil and
drums of gasoline from the the vessel without creating another spill.
   The United States, Argentina and Chile have been working to clean
up the wreckage, the first real environmental threat to the
untouched Antarctic.
   Araya said a special skimming boat from the United States has
cleaned up most of the oil slick. Asked in a telephone interview
whether the problem is considered under control, Araya replied, ``I
would say so.''
   Araya said the skimming boat had cleaned up Palmer Bay two miles
from the ship. The skimming craft was being used Friday inside a
ring of floating booms set up around the ship to contain the leak.
   The emergency craft is supported by the Polar Duke, a National
Science Foundation vessel that traveled to the spill carrying 52
tons of cleanup equipment.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Antarctica, beyond the comfort zone - Michael J.
Woods watches seals, terns and whales in inhospitable waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With hardly a sound, the sea lapped on to the shore of granite, ground to a
silky smoothness by ice and water - itself blanketed by a layer of snow.
Portly crab-eater seals lay enveloped in the folds of this fluffed and
plumped duvet or sprawled on bluish ice floes carved and drawn like glass
into delicate graceful shapes by the sea. Distant cliffs of rock and ice
loomed through a mist of floating flakes of a soft shower of snow.
Antarctic terns cried and hovered over a shoal of fish, diving and then
swooping upwards on confident wings. But from a distance came the sudden
roar of a collapsing ice cliff which, with immense force, sent a surge of
waves sweeping into the bay, a timely reminder that Antarctica is far from
placid and, even in the austral summer, can be fierce and inhospitable.
I had come here to fulfil a childhood dream born out of Scott, Amundsen and
Shackleton, nurtured by Edmund Hillary and Vivien Fuchs and given a final
push by David Attenborough's BBC series, Life In The Freezer.
From Punta Arenas in southern Chile our cruise ship, World Explorer, had
navigated the Beagle Channel, rounded the Horn and then braved the Drake
Passage, a two-day gauntlet run by every visitor to the Antarctic Peninsula.
The gods had been kind, and we stole into the shelter of the South Shetland
Islands with half a day in hand.
This gave us time to slip into the Weddell Sea, gliding delicately between
tabular icebergs which had calved from the ice shelf and were drifting
slowly away from the continent. These flat-topped monoliths, like blocks of
flats badly cast in concrete, towered high above the seven decks of the
ship. That a further eight ninths plunged into the depths below was almost
beyond comprehension.
Although there were some on board who had no intention of going ashore, and
others who simply wanted to tick off their final continent, many of the
passengers told me that they really weren't 'cruise people.' They were there
because the only way that Antarctica is readily accessible to ordinary
visitors is by cruise ship.
These not only provide comfortable accommodation with minimal impact on the
environment, but visits to the shore by inflatable Zodiac can be more easily
controlled.
I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial
check by an observer from the National Science Foundation who had come along
to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were
receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they
were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by
its own controlling body, the International Association of Antarctic Tour
Operators (Iaato).
This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints
are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a
tiny proportion of the continent, grows.
Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of
passengers are ashore. As a result, the expedition leader's advice to take
an early Zodiac ashore and catch the last one back was worth heeding.
On one of my trips ashore I watched a mass of chin-strap penguins in an
odoriferous rookery high on a stony hillside. There were birds feeding
chicks, stealing pebbles from their neighbours' nests, preening, displaying
or making their ponderous and squelchy way over dirty snow to and from the
sea.
On the shore below, a steaming heap of elephant seals wobbled irritably as
one animal tried to burrow further into the pile. Occasionally things proved
too much and a pair reared up, snorting and lunging, until honour was
satisfied and the two brown blancmanges settled down once more.
As we climbed aboard the last Zodiac to leave our final landfall at Port
Lockroy, one of the guides spotted the blow of a humpback whale a short
distance away, and we set off over the choppy water for a closer look.
The three great mammals were in no hurry and lazed along on the surface,
breathing noisily before arching their backs with utmost grace and sliding
into the depths, lifting their tails clear of the water - called fluking -
before disappearing with hardly a ripple. The Zodiac, which for a few
seconds had been dwarfed by cetacean tails, erupted with elated cries.
We followed the circular upwellings of water created by thrusts of their
flukes, and were there when they resurfaced after just 3 1/2 minutes. Again
they lazed on the surface; again they fluked. But time was passing and we
had to return to the World Discoverer.
Back on board, the mother ship began to shadow the whales. The sun was
falling in a clear, pale blue sky and our position between the Antarctic
Peninsula and several large islands felt as if we were sailing on a vast
lake surrounded by the soaring spires of mountains, unnamed and unexplored,
with dark, snow-dusted peaks piercing the huge iceflows.
These, the product of decades of snow, clawed down the mountain sides and
crumpled over folds in the underlying rock before calving chunks into the
dark blue Antarctic Ocean.
The great cetaceans had the muscle to outpace us had they wished, yet they
continued on their leisurely way, fluking and diving to delighted cheers
from the bows.
It would be hard to think of a natural spectacle more magnificent than
watching these massive mammals in a primeval landscape of such grandeur, so
outside the human dimension as to be at once both humbling and
awe-inspiring. Most of those on the ship - some were extremely
well-travelled - were unlikely to experience a scene of such power and
splendour anywhere else.
Michael Woods travelled to Antarctica c/o Clipper Voyages: Suite 301, Albany
house, 324-326 Regent Street, London W1R 5AA. Reservations: 071-436-2931.
The company runs adventure cruises during the austral summer (16 nights or
more).
All-inclusive prices, including airfares, transfers, hotels where necessary,
full board on the ship and insurance, start from Pounds 4,606 (1994-1995
season) for the 16-night cruise that Woods experienced (two departures: Dec
4 1994 and Jan 2 1995). Clipper will be operating a further six voyages to
the Antarctic, taking in, additionally, the Falklands and South Georgia.
World Discoverer handles a maximum of 138 passengers.
Clothing: Clipper provides a padded parka but other items are essential.
Thermal underwear as a base layer, and good quality fleece garments such as
those made by Mountain Equipment (tel: 061-366-5020) as an intermediate
layer, should be covered with a windproof outer shell. The parka is fine but
Woods found a Goretex outer over a down jacket more flexible. Waterproof
trousers and wellingtons are essential in the Zodiacs and for wet landings.
Photography: take plenty of film as well as spare batteries, which are
exhausted more quickly in the cold. A tripod is useful at the penguin
rookeries and for the seals. Carry polythene bags to protect your gear.

<LEADPARA>  Scottie Bowman leans forward in the office chair and disappears briefly behind
a cluttered desk as he undoes the laces of his skates. It is disconcerting to
see Bowman behind that desk when one is accustomed to seeing Bob Johnson
there, chattering for hours about the most obscure, seemingly irrelevant
hockey subjects.;   Bowman provides an obscure detail of his own. The
Pittsburgh Penguins will play 23 divisional games in the first half, he says,
and 13 of them will be played at home. That tidbit is worthy of Johnson.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And after all, Bowman is sitting in Johnson's office, the coach's office,
at Civic Arena. There is a wood-paneled locker by the door bearing a nameplate
that reads "B. Johnson." There is a photo of Johnson on the wall, and on the
floor is another, of Johnson, wife Martha and the Stanley Cup.;   Three
banners were raised Saturday night to the domed ceiling of Civic Arena. The
Penguins won the Patrick Division championship in the regular season and the
playoffs. They won the Prince of Wales Conference. And they won the Cup that
sits next to Johnson in the photograph.;   Johnson is fairly beaming in that
shot. The Penguins had 13 coaches in their 23 years before he arrived, and
none managed to win the Stanley Cup.;   The team celebrated that achievement
Saturday, or tried to, before a game against the New York Rangers. A telecast
of the game was available in Colorado Springs, where Johnson is recovering
from the radiation treatments he received for two brain tumors.;   "The whole
family is in Colorado Springs and they can watch it on television," Penguins
General Manager Craig Patrick said. "They're going to have a little party and
enjoy the banner-raisings just as we will.";   Saturday was the Penguins'
third home game; these things usually are done before the opener. The Penguins
had wanted to wait until Johnson was well enough to attend the ceremony, but
that wait might be very long.;   So the flags went up Saturday night and the
diamond rings were handed out Monday. Now the Penguins try to defend their
championship with another man behind Johnson's desk, behind Johnson's bench.; 
 "My approach, as an interim coach, is to make as few changes as possible,"
said Bowman, who had been perfectly happy in his role as director of player
development. "I feel my role is to try to avoid confusion -- to try to play
the same style of hockey, try to get Mario Lemieux on the ice as much as we
can, try to play him with Paul Coffey . . . the things they did a year ago."; 
 The Penguins are fortunate to have Bowman. No coach has guided more
regular-season triumphs than Bowman's 743. None has more playoff victories
than Bowman's 114. The first of his five Stanley Cup rings is 18 years old; it
is 15 months younger than the Penguins' Jaromir Jagr.;   Bob Johnson's first
Cup ring has a skating Penguin in the center and an oval diamond forming the
white belly of the bird's tuxedo. It took a lifetime to earn, and it is
totally unfair there should be so much less time to enjoy it.;   Left wing
Kevin Stevens said, "We pray for Bob," and you had to know they were thinking
of him when the flags went up Saturday night.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  HE COACHED teams to a league-record 739 victories and five Stanley Cup
championships by ruling with an iron fist, but Scotty Bowman says he is taking
a new approach with the Pittsburgh Penguins.;   Bowman, most famous for
winning five Stanley Cup titles with the Montreal Canadiens during the 1970s,
is trying to carry on the tradition established last season by Penguins Coach
Bob Johnson, who used positive reinforcement and unwavering optimism as tools
to lead the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup championship.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although he had no intention of returning to coaching when the Penguins
hired him as a director of player development before last season, Bowman has
been on the Pittsburgh bench since doctors discovered in late August that
Johnson had brain cancer, which ultimately took Johnson's life Nov. 26.;  
Bowman says life on the bench has been different for him this time around.;  
"This isn't my team, really," Bowman said as he watched the Penguins practice
at the Cow Palace for a game against the Sharks last week. "Times have
changed. The players have changed. I'm just the coach this time. I'm not the
general manager, so I'm free to spend more time with the players and get to
know them a little better.";   Bowman also said some of Johnson's personality
may have rubbed off on him.;   "I saw what he did here," Bowman said. "The
inspiration he gave these players is still with them, and I don't want to try
to break that down. I want to try to keep them upbeat and look for the
positive things.";   So far, Bowman has been well received.;   "We all feel
lucky to have been coached by a man like Bob Johnson, but I think we also feel
fortunate that there was a man like Scotty Bowman there to take over in this
situation," Penguins defenseman Paul Coffey said.; WHITNEY UPDATE: Center Ray
Whitney, the second player chosen by the Sharks in June's entry draft, is
playing for the independent San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey League
and scored six goals with three assists in his first six games.;   Although
NHL rules prohibit the Sharks from assigning Whitney to their IHL affiliate in
Kansas City because he has juniors eligibility remaining, he was able to sign
with the Gulls because they have no NHL affiliate.; DIZZY: Former Olympian
Lane MacDonald, the 1989 Hobey Baker Award winner as the best collegiate
player in the United States, has retired from hockey and plans to go into
business in San Francisco.;   MacDonald was still with Team USA for an
exhibition game against the Sharks at the Cow Palace on Nov. 17, but decided
to retire because of a recurring health problem.;   Before joining Team USA,
MacDonald had been out of hockey for two years because of trauma-induced
migraines. He said the problem returned when he took a hit during an
exhibition game against the Calgary Flames in Salt Lake City in September.;  
"I couldn't talk for about 20 minutes," MacDonald said. "I couldn't put a
sentence together. It was just a little scary.";   MacDonald scored six goals
for Team USA in the 1988 winter Olympics.; AROUND THE NHL: To get a feel for
how well Winnipeg Jets goalie Bob Essensa is playing, consider this: Essensa
has allowed only 17 goals during the nine-game unbeaten streak that the Jets
are riding even though the Jets have been outshot 328-241 in those games. . .
. Montreal Coach Pat Burns, who was promoting the use of condoms after news
broke that basketball star Magic Johnson has the virus that causes AIDS, has
decided he will no longer answer AIDS-related questions because the issue has
become a distraction for his players. "I won't discuss it anymore," Burns told
reporters after practice Friday. "Hockey is our business, and we'll discuss
hockey, not AIDS or anything else." . . . The debate over realignment has
become more heated since Winnipeg officials recently began to press for a move
back to the Norris Division, and the issue had to be tabled during a Board of
Governors meeting last week. The Jets moved from the Norris Division to the
Smythe in 1982, but insist they did so only on the condition that they be
moved back when the league added another western team. That condition was met
when the Sharks joined the league this season, but not everyone wants to
tamper with the status quo. "The whole league is being inconvenienced by the
Jets," one governor told the Canadian Press.  </TEXT>
