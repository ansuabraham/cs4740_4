  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) will discuss problems resulting from the 
growing world population at a symposium from Saturday in 
preparation for a United Nations Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo, Egypt, later this year, organizers said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The symposium, which will be held at Waseda University in 
Tokyo, is co-organized by the "Peoples' Forum 2001," an NGO 
umbrella organization, and "Japan's Network for Women and 
Health," which aims at increasing women's representation at the 
Cairo conference. 
  Panelists will include Makoto Ato, head of the Health and 
Welfare Ministry's Institute of Population Problems, Assistant 
Prof. Chizuko Ueno of Tokyo University and representatives of 
the U.N. Population Fund. 
  The symposium will adopt an appeal urging the Japanese 
Government to include NGO and women representatives in its 
delegation for the Cairo conference. The suggestions will be 
submitted to the government-organized "Tokyo Wise Men's 
Conference on Population and Development," which will be held on 
February 26 and 27. 
  "Population growth in developing countries is a result of 
environment destruction by developed countries. There the 
Japanese bear responsibility too," said Shunsuke Iwasaki, 
assistant professor at Tsukuba University and head of the 
Peoples' Forum 2001. 
  "This problem is not that simple that it could be solved by 
just providing means for birth control. As the Cairo conference 
is drawing closer, we want to make the first step to give 
ordinary people a say (in these matters)," Iwasaki said in 
explaining the objectives of the symposium. 
  The U.N. holds its international Conference on Population 
and 
Development every ten years. This year's conference, from 
September 5 to 13, will adopt an action program seeking to 
establish a sustainable balance between the soaring population, 
scarce resources and an increasingly damaged environment. 
  The U.N. estimates that the world population will grow by a 
record 93 million to over 5.7 billion in 1994, with the majority 
of the growth occurring in developing countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan will cosponsor an 
eminent persons' meeting on the subjects of population and 
development on January 26 and 27 in Tokyo, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Terusuke Terada said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The meeting will formulate its recommendations to a 
UN-sponsored conference in Cairo next September. 
  Some 20 high-level scholars, academics and political leaders 
who are well-versed in the problems of population will attend 
the meeting at the UN University in Tokyo, Terada said. 
  Participants will include such prominent figures as 
Norwegian 
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Mexican President 
Miguel de la Madrid, former World Bank President Robert McNamara 
and Taro Nakayama, former Japanese foreign minister. 
  The meeting is to be held under the cosponsorship of the 
U.N. 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN University and the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will address the 
opening ceremony. 
  The participants are expected to adopt a Tokyo declaration 
on 
the closing day. 
  The deliberations at the meeting will be recommended to the 
U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Population and 
Development, which is to be held in Cairo in September to 
discuss measures for problems related to the rapidly increasing 
world population. 
  Terada said Japan is by far the largest donor country for 
UNFPA, donating 59 million dollars in 1992 and as much as 63 
million dollars in 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- A United Nations-sponsored 
meeting on population and development concluded Thursday [27 
January] with a declaration urging governments to curb 
population growth. 
  The two-day conference was held at the United Nations 
University in Tokyo. 
  "Population growth is a major obstacle to the alleviation of 
poverty, sustained socioeconomic development, and the 
improvement of the status of women," said the draft text of the 
Tokyo declaration of the meeting of eminent persons on 
population and development. 
  The meeting, also sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was 
held 
in preparation for the International Conference on Population 
and Development (ICPD) slated for September in Cairo. 
  "We...call upon all governments and intergovernmental and 
nongovernmental organizations to do their utmost to make the 
(Cairo) conference a milestone in the global effort to eradicate 
poverty and socioeconomic inequality, to achieve sustained 
economic growth and sustainable development, to improve the 
status and role of women and to reduce population growth," it 
said. 
  The United Nations has predicted the world population, now 
at 
5.6 billion, will increase to 10 billion by 2050. 
  The declaration urged developing countries to integrate 
population issues into national development planning, and 
developed nations to change their patterns of consumption and to 
curb overproduction in order to reduce the impact on the 
environment and on the use of resources. 
  It also urged "the world community...to increase their 
financial commitment to population and related activities in 
developing countries in order to reach the estimated amount of 
approximately 13 billion dollars...by the year 2000 and 
approximately 17 billion dollars by the year 2015 annually." 
  At a news conference held immediately after the meeting 
ended, International Planned Parenthood Federation President 
Fred Sai, vice chairman of the Tokyo meeting, said, "one thing 
which has come out here...is that...we have to start addressing 
population issues much more seriously." 
  He said the other point stressed through the discussion was 
the importance of "partnership between the developed and 
developing countries." 
  The news conference was also attended by Nafis Sadik, 
executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, U.N. University 
Rector Heitor Gurgulino de Souza, Egypt's National Population 
Council Secretary General Maher Mahran [name as received] and 
former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, chairman of the 
gathering. 
  The 14-member panel of the meeting debated sustainable 
development, family planning and the status of women in relation 
to population. 
  The panel also included former World Bank President Robert 
McNamara, former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado 
and former Kiribati President Jeremia T. Tabai.

  [Text] The contents of a draft report the government plans 
to submit at the UN "International Conference on Population and 
Development" (ICPD), which is to be held this September in 
Cairo, was revealed on 1 March. In the report, the government 
touches on such issues as population trends and reduced birth 
rates. Regarding environmental hazards brought about by 
population growth concentrated in particular regions, the 
government concludes that "A high standard of education has 
enabled the nation to overcome such problems rather quickly." 
However, the government completely fails to touch on 
environmental issues which large cities face, such as huge 
amounts of garbage and air pollution. This stance is expected 
to cause a stir, inasmuch as the main theme of the Cairo 
conference includes "population, development, and environment." 
  The government's draft report consists of 17 pages of text 
divided into four major sections: 
  1) population trends and future outlook; 
  2) current situation regarding government policies related 
to 
population trends; 
  3) international cooperation regarding population issues; 
and 
  4) summary and conclusion. 
  Seven sets of graphical data, such as that showing trends in 
average lifespans, are also included in the draft report. 
  Regarding problems resulting from population movements 
within 
the nation, the government, in the report, refers to the cases 
of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto as examples. It points out that in 
these cities, "the population began growing in the 1960's due to 
the development of heavy chemical industries and the urban 
living environment rapidly deteriorated." It adds that the 
nation "was able to proceed with economic development in harmony 
with environmental preservation, after succeeding in overcoming 
population, developmental, and environmental crises rather 
quickly through public support and government efforts." 
  In the report, the government contends that the nation was 
able to overcome such crises due to "an especially high standard 
of education." It adds that "putting emphasis on education and 
the government's effective use of information play an invaluable 
role in international efforts to help developing countries with 
their population problems." 
  In Tokyo and other major cities, the problem of securing 
garbage disposal sites has become very serious. Nitrogen oxide 
emissions accompanying the sharp increase in automobile traffic 
have led to air pollution. The government fails to take up 
these issues in its draft report. In this regard, an official 
of the Health and Welfare Ministry explained: "It is impossible 
to cover all population-related issues, and there is also a 
limit to the report's length." 
  However, greater interest has been shown in developing 
countries concerning air pollution and garbage issues because 
recently, the environment has been deteriorating in these 
countries due to a rapidly growing population concentrated in 
cities.

<TEXT>
   Seven babies are born every second in Asia, and the continent may be only days away from reaching three billion inhabitants. 
This is causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner. 

   China greeted the prospect with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control. 
In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people. 

   Takashi Sato, Japan's minister of agriculture, said Friday that "excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy . . . and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries. 

   "Without global-level responses to the issues of population, food, environment and development," he said, "it would be difficult for the world to welcome a peaceful 21st century." 
Mr. Sato is chairman of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, which sponsored the conference. 

   In July 1987, the world's population passed five billion, double the population in 1950. 

   According to United Nations estimates, Asia's population will reach three billion on Aug. 10. 
Asia experts, however, predict the milestone will be reached within days. 

   Prof. Gayl D. Ness of the University of Michigan, a sociologist and researcher on Asian population, estimated that Asia's population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the century -- and to 4.5 billion by the year 2025 while the world population reaches 8.2 billion. 

   Rice production will have to increase 50% by 2025 to feed the continent, Prof. Ness said, but great gains already have been registered by farmers in China, Japan and Southeast Asia. 

   The 21st century targets, he said, "are well within the realm of possibility if the agricultural transformation continues; this, of course, requires sensitive government policies." 

   Asia, said Prof. Ness, has made "substantial progress" in lowering fertility rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to limit population growth. 

   But he noted disparities between regions of Asia. 
East Asian countries such as China, which has 1.08 billion people, and Japan, which has 122 million, have rapidly declining fertility rates. 
But in South Asia, India is still experiencing 2.08% annual growth in its current population of 818 million; Pakistan has 3.45% growth with 115 million people; and Bangladesh has a 2.67% growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according to U.N. figures. 

   "The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the death rates," Prof. Ness said. 

   He and other panelists were critical of the United States for withdrawing money from the U.N. Fund for Population Activities because of the fund's support for abortion. 

   The population growth also has caused some social changes. 

   Prof. Toshio Kuroda, director emeritus of Tokyo's Institute of Population at Nihon University, noted that China "expects the family to care for the aged . . . but the family is undergoing tremendous change in China with the one-child family." 

   China, the world's most populous country, has since the early 1980s limited most families to one child. 
But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years. 

   In Beijing, Chinese officials heralded the Day of Three Billion in Asia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People. They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers, doctors and others for "outstanding performance in implementing our population policy." Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. Said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman:
   "We cannot think that we can have more children because of economic development . . . nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Shanghai and Bangkok will 
be the subject of a three-year study by a group of Japanese 
scientists to help curb environmental destruction in the face of 
Asia's rapidly expanding population, officials of the Health and 
Welfare Ministry said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The study will be launched later this year and will focus on 
the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption 
of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the 
officials said. 
  Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn 
entire regions into deserts. 
  The team of scientists from the ministry's Institute of 
Population Problems and Institute of Public Health hope to 
improve long-term forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in Asia 
by examining the causes of population growth and the impact of 
rural migration to cities, they said. 
  The group will also look at how global warming affects the 
spread of malaria, they said. 
  The results of the study will be used to draw up population 
and energy conservation policies that could help reduce the 
impact of global warming. 
  The Environment Agency will incorporate the findings in its 
"Eco- Asia 21 Plan" and will try to enlist support from other 
Asian countries, the officials said. 
  World population is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by 
the turn of the century from 5.3 billion in 1990. According to 
United Nations population fund forecasts, it will further swell 
to 8.5 billion in 2025, with more than half of the growth 
occurring in Asia, mainly China and India. 
  Rural migration is likely to continue, raising the portion 
of 
people living in Asian cities from 30 percent of total 
population to over 50 percent in 2020. 
  The National Institute for Environmental Studies estimates 
that Asia's energy consumption will show annual growth rates of 
3.2 percent, far outstripping the world average of 1.6 percent.

   Seven babies are born every second in Asia and the

Nations University in Tokyo. She was also to speak at the 
opening ceremony of the gathering. 
  The meeting, to be held in preparation for the international 
conference on population and development slated for September in 
Cairo, will discuss sustainable development, family planning and 
the status of women in relation to population.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Japan's young population 
declined further to total 20.59 million children under the age 
of 15 as of April 1, down 500,000 from a year ago, the 
Management and Coordination Agency said Wednesday [4 May], a day 
before Children's Day. As of April 1 this year, children 
accounted for 16.5 percent of the nation's 125 million 
population, down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year, 
the agency said. 
  Since 1975, Japan has witnessed a steady decline in its 
population of children, a trend often referred to as Japan's 
aging society. 
  The largest portion of the nation's children, some 1.62 
million, are already teenagers aged 14. Reflecting the 
declining birth rate over the last decade, the younger the 
child, the fewer peers in his age group. 
  About 1.2 million children belong to each age group between 
1 
and 4. Children under 1 year old numbered 1.19 million. 
  Okinawa Prefecture was Japan's "youngest" prefecture with 
more than one in five persons, or 22.8 percent, under 15, 
according to statistics as of October 1, 1993. Following were 
Saga Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture with 18.9 percent each. 
  In contrast, Tokyo with more than 11 million inhabitants had 
the lowest share of children with some 13.9 percent. A slightly 
higher percentage of young people were living in Toyama 
prefecture, with 15.8 percent, and Kanagawa Prefecture, with 
15.9 percent. 
  In all 47 prefectures, the share of children was lower than 
the previous year. 
  Compared with other aging industrialized nations, Japan came 
third after Italy and Germany, where children under 15 accounted 
for 16.3 percent of the national populations, based on 1991 and 
1992 surveys, respectively.

  [Text] Sapporo, April 5 KYODO -- Most of Japan's minority 
Ainu remain dissatisfied with their standard of living, 
according to a survey released by the prefectural government on 
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. The survey showed 
that 33 percent of the Ainu families interviewed on Hokkaido 
said they find it "tough" to make ends meet, while another 44 
percent opted to characterize it as "somewhat difficult." 
  A total of 300 Ainu families in Hokkaido, where most of 
Japan's Ainu live, were interviewed last June for the survey, 
which has been conducted every seven years since 1972. Despite 
complaints about difficulties in earning a livelihood, the 
survey showed that ratio of Ainu receiving welfare payments from 
the government fell from 60.9 per 1,000 population in the last 
survey, undertaken in 1986, to 38.8 per 1,000 population in the 
current survey. 
  The survey said Hokkaido's Ainu population stood at 23,830, 
or a decrease of 551 over the last survey. 
  There are few remaining full-blooded Ainu in Japan. Counted 
as Ainu in the survey were those thought to have at least some 
Ainu blood or those living in families with members who have 
Ainu blood. 
  The survey said the percentage of Ainu children going on to 
senior high school increased by 9 points to 87.4 percent, though 
it fell short of the 96.3 percent overall figure for Hokkaido 
children. A bigger gap surfaced in the figures for those 
children proceeding to university or college, with 11.8 percent 
for the relevant Ainu population compared with 27.5 percent for 
the overall population. 
  In a questionnaire targeting Ainu aged 15 and older, only 
7.3 
percent said they faced incidences of discrimination over the 
past six or seven years, while 62 percent said they had not. 
  Officials said the Hokkaido Prefectural Government intends 
to 
use the survey in planning its future Ainu welfare policies.

   The population of Asia has reached three billion, according to a report released by a group of politicians representing 19 Asian nations. 

   The Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development report, based on data compiled by the United Nations, said this mark was reached at 47 minutes after midnight Greenwhich Mean Time yesterday. 

   Asia, the world's most populous region, accounts for 60% of the total global population, which passed the five billion mark in July 1987. 
Seven babies are born in Asia every second -- or 150,000 each day, the report said. 

   The forum, headed by Takashi Sato, Japan's Agriculture Minister, issued the report at an international conference in Tokyo last month, heralding the Day of the Three Billion. 
The forum includes 19 Asian nations from Australia to Syria. 

   "The designation of a day marking the birth of the three-billionth baby in Asia is very symbolic," Shigemi Kono, director general of the National Institute of Population Problems, said. 
"But I personally think it is nonsense, because there is no way of actually knowing when the three-billionth baby was born." 

   Skepticism about calculations aside, however, Mr. Kono agrees there are serious population problems in the region. 

   "Though we have come close to solving the fertility rate problem in Japan and China, serious questions remain in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan," he said. 

   India, with a population of 818 million, has an annual growth rate of 2.08%. 
The rate in Pakistan, with a population of 115 million, is 3.45%, and in Bangladesh, with 110 million people, it is 2.67%, according to U.N. estimates. 

   By the year 2025, Asia will have 4.5 billion inhabitants, said an official with the nonprofit, Tokyo-based Asian Population and Development Association. 
The estimated growth in Asia is roughly equal to the increase in the total world population from 1950 to 1980, she added. 

   Specialists have predicted that rice production will have to increase 50% by 2025 to feed the continent.

   The population of Asia topped 3 billion on
Wednesday, according to United Nations estimates.
   The report, issued by the U.N.'s Asian Forum of Parliamentarians
on Population and Development, estimated that the population hit
the 3 billion mark Wednesday at 12:47 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time
(8:47 p.m. EDT Tuesday).
   Seven babies are born every second in Asia, and the continent
accounts for about 60 percent of the global population, according
to the forum, which represents 19 Asian countries.
   ``The designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionth

   Among Asian countries, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan face the
most serious population growth problems, Kono said.
   U.N. figures show that India, with 818 million people, has an
annual population growth rate of 2.08 percent. Pakistan, with a
population of 115 million, has a 3.45 percent growth rate and the
110 million population of Bangladesh is growing at a 2.67 percent
rate, according to the United Nations. By the year 2025, Asia will
have 4.5 billion inhabitants, according to the Tokyo-based Asian
Population and Development Association _ roughly equal to the
increase in the total world population from 1950 to 1980.
   The world population passed the 5 billion mark in July 1987,
according to the United Nations.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD) 
closed here today. 
  The meeting has further promoted mutual understanding and 
friendship among the participants from 15 countries including 
China after their discussions on issues of population and 
development and women's position and role. 
  Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian population and 
development association, described the two-day meeting as 
significant. 
  He said that in September this year, the Third International 
Conference on Population and Development will be held in Cairo, 
at which a policy on population is expected to be approved. 
  He expressed the hope that this policy will become a program 
for actions of all countries in the next 20 years. 
  Hao Yichun, deputy head of the delegation of China's 
National 
People's Congress (NPC) and vice-chairman of the NPC Education, 
Science, Culture and Public Health Committee, said with the 
common efforts by the Asian parliamentarians, the meeting has 
achieved a complete success. 
  Noting that Asia is the most populous region in the world, 
Hao said the solution of the Asian population problem will be of 
great importance to peace, prosperity and development of Asia 
and the rest of the world. 
  She said many Asian countries have already adopted proper 
measures to reduce the birth rate and have achieved significant 
results. 
  However, Hao said the trend of rapid population growth has 
not yet been checked and the task of improving the quality of 
human resources is still arduous. 
  The solution of population problems requires the common 
efforts from Asian parliaments, governments, non-governmental 
organizations as well as the people from every Asian country, 
she added. 
  After the meeting Fukusaburo Maeda and leaders from the 
Asian 
forum and the UN Population Fund gave a press conference and 
answered questions on cooperation between China and the UN 
Population Fund.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Despite a wedding every 40 
seconds, fewer babies than ever were born in Japan in 1993 and a 
record number of couples ended up in divorces, the Health and 
Welfare Ministry said Friday [31 December]. 
  With 9.6 babies born per thousand people the birth rate hit 
a 
historic low. The number of births fell by 24,000 to 1.19 
million, sinking below the 1.2 million mark for the first time, 
the ministry said in announcing the estimate for this year. 
  The statistics were projected for the whole calendar year 
based on the number of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces 
registered between January 1 and October 31. 
  The low birth rate is expected to further reduce the 
fertility rate, which represents the average number of children 
a woman gives birth to in her life, from its all-time low last 
year of 1.5 children, officials said. To maintain the current 
population over the long run the rate must be 2.1 or above. 
  Apparently sparked by the June wedding between Crown Prince 
Naruhito and Masako Owada, 38,000 more couples tied the knot 
than in 1992. The number of marriages has been continuously on 
the rise over the last six years, reaching 792,000 in 1993. 
  The wedding fever was especially strong in June, which saw 
an 
increase by 10,000 marriages over last year. On June 9 alone, 
the day of the royal wedding, 13,000 couples started married 
life. However, the country also experienced a second divorce 
boom following a first peak in 1983. After a continued rise 
over the last three years, divorces peaked at 189,000, an 
all-time high. Some 10,000 more couples decided to separate than 
last year, amounting to a divorce every 2 minutes 47 seconds. 
  While births still outstripped deaths, the natural 
population 
increase further slowed to an all-time low 302,000 people, 
50,000 less than in 1992. Partly due to an influenza epidemic 
in January and February, deaths soared by 26,000 to a record 
883,000. 
  As to the causes of death, cancer ranked top with 237,000 
cases, followed by 183,000 deaths resulting from heart diseases, 
and some 120,000 people dying from cerebrovascular diseases. 
The pattern remained unchanged since 1985.

  [Text] Omiya, Japan, June 22 KYODO -- Representatives from 
16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ended a two-day 
environmental meeting Wednesday [22 June] with a call for the 
development of sustainable cities and the protection of island 
nations from the effects of global warming. 
  The call was included in a document adopted at the 
environment congress for Asia and the Pacific (Eco Asia `94) in 
Omiya, Saitama Prefecture. 
  Senior officials from 16 governments, including five 
ministers, as well as representatives from eight international 
organizations attended the congress. 
  The congress, the third since 1991, reviewed progress in 
achieving environmentally sustainable development in the region 
since the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), otherwise known as the earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro 
in June 1992. 
  The document, issued in the name of the conference 
chairwoman, Environment Agency Director General Toshiko 
Hamayotsu, said the region needs to shift from theoretical 
considerations to "concerted political and practical actions, 
international cooperation, and sufficient institutional and 
capacity building." 
  Countries represented at the congress are home to more than 
half the world's population, with millions of people 
concentrated in rapidly growing cities. 
  The document notes the concern of delegates over pollution 
and urban crowding in the region caused by rapid economic 
development at the expense of the environment. 
  It urges, for the first time at an Eco Asia meeting, the 
development of the concept of sustainable cities. 
  It also calls for developed countries to "change their mass 
consumption lifestyles, provide support for realization of 
sustainable development in developing countries and prevent the 
export of pollution." 
  "Solid waste disposal has become a critical issue in this 
region," the document says. 
  The document also incorporates a call made Tuesday by 
Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja to "tackle 
the problems" of small island states. 
  Indonesia and a number of other Pacific nations incorporate 
thousands of small, low-lying islands which could be threatened 
if global warming causes a rise in sea levels. 
  Although many delegates favored establishment of an Eco Asia 
secretariat in Japan, opinion was not unanimous and the document 
merely calls for "development mechanisms for smooth and 
effective implementation of Eco Asia activities." 
  Malaysian Environment Minister Hieng Ding Law, who served as 
congress co-chairman, told a press conference after the congress 
that there was "a general feeling that Eco Asia should continue." 
  "It is high time Japan should play a more significant role 
in 
implementing UNCED," Law said. "It is important to have a 
secretariat and a data bank."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] proposed a three-stage scheme 
to build a nationwide optical-fiber telecommunications network 
by 2010 as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an 
information-oriented society in the next century. 
  The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by 
boosting Japan's multimedia market by 56 trillion yen to 123 
trillion yen by the targeted year, said the Telecommunications 
Council, an advisory body to the posts minister. 
  The council said the telecom project would help correct the 
over- centralization of information in Tokyo, quicken economic 
restructuring in Japan through the creation of new business and 
expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an 
expected diffusion of "satellite" remote offices. 
  The scheme is also designed for the efficient use of natural 
resources and energy, contributing to a solution of 
environmental issues, one of the biggest global problems toward 
the 21st century. 
  In the recommendation presented to Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa, the council called 
for the laying of a core optical-cable network linking the 
prefectural capitals by 2000, in a first-phase project that 
would cover 20 percent of the nation's population. 
  A second-stage network should be built by 2005 to connect 
cities with populations of over 100,000 for a population 
coverage of 60 percent, the council said. 
  Nationwide hookup is set for the year of 2010 when Japan's 
population is expected to peak, it said. 
  Apart from the three-stage scheme, an optical cable network 
to link major public organs, like schools, libraries, hospitals 
and welfare facilities, should be built by 2000, accompanied by 
the development of application software for use at such 
institutions, the council said. 
  "Based on the council proposal, the posts ministry will push 
for various measures to implement the program, including further 
deregulation in telecom fields and an ample amount of budgetary 
allocation by the Finance Ministry, an official at the posts 
ministry told a press conference. 
  Tuesday's proposal has been apparently prompted by "the 
information superhighway scheme" unveiled earlier by the United 
States. 
  As under the U.S. scheme, the Japanese project is expected 
to 
provide a wide range of multimedia services in the next century, 
which the council says would make Japanese people's livelihood 
"dramatically more comfortable." 
  As possible multimedia services under the scheme, the 
council 
cited remote medical checking, video-on-demand services, home 
shopping, electronic libraries, virtual reality leisure parks, 
interactive access to administrative information and remote 
education services. 
  The proposed optical-fiber network is projected to cost 53 
trillion yen when the single-star (SS) system, the most 
sophisticated optical cable networking method, is used at 
subscribing companies and households, the council said. 
  The cost would be lower at 33 trillion yen if networking is 
done with a combination of the SS system and a less 
sophisticated system, a more practical approach in view of 
Japan's current technological level. 
  The council said the private sector should play a key role 
in 
developing related application software. But government support 
is also necessary in the inititial stage of networking that 
focuses on infrastructure improvement. 
  The task of laying the core part of the fiber cable network 
should be basically entrusted to either telecommunications 
companies like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) or 
cable television operators, the council said. 
  The posts ministry official avoided stating a specific role 
by NTT in the fiber project, noting that further discussion 
needs to be conducted to decide who should take charge of the 
task. 
  "To create a business environment that maximizes competition 
among various sectors would eventually serve the interest of 
general users," the council said. 
  It said interest-free loans and tax incentives should be 
provided to entities participating in costly infrastructure 
improvement projects in the scheme. 
  The optical-fiber network scheme is most likely to produce 
various social, legal and security problems that the Japanese 
people have rarely experienced in the past -- those uniquely 
inherent in the nature of multimedia services. 
  Among them are an unintended violation of individual privacy 
and intellectual property rights. The legal framework should be 
upgraded to cope with these problems, the council said. 
  The council also called for the standardization of telecom 
equipment and systems in accordance with international standards. 
  The concept of "universal services" should be introduced for 
the new telecom scheme, in which services are equally offered 
across the nation at reasonable prices, the council said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The consumption tax may be 
renamed the "welfare tax" in a bid to win public support for 
raising it, government sources said Thursday [20 January]. 
  The issue has been deliberated within government circles for 
some time, the sources said. 
  The governing coalition has been under pressure to clarify 
the purpose of the tax in light of the rapid aging of Japan's 
population, they said. 
  It is also being argued that a name change could help win 
support for raising the current rate from 3 percent, a move that 
is strongly opposed by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], 
the largest party in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition government. 
  The idea has met with criticism from some people engaged in 
various welfare programs, who fear that the amount of tax 
collected under that name might be regarded as a ceiling for 
welfare spending.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Thursday [3 February] agreed to provide a total of 12 billion 
dollars from now until the year 2000 for projects aimed at 
curbing the spread of AIDS and bringing the global population 
growth under control, Japanese officials said. 
  The agreement emerged from the bilateral "framework" trade 
negotiations under way in Tokyo, and will be officially 
announced after the meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton slated for February 11 
in Washington. 
  Under the scheme, Japan will give 3 billion dollars and the 
U.S. 9 billion dollars over the seven years. 
  The sums compare with 70 million dollars in annual financial 
aid extended by Japan for such purposes and 600 million dollars 
by the United States. 
  The sharply boosted aid will be used to try to find an AIDS 
cure, supply developing nations with condoms, and enlighten 
people there about the disease. 
  The money will also finance projects designed to spread 
knowledge of family planning and help poor countries compile 
more reliable population statistics. 
  According to data by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
the 
world's HIV carriers number 14 million at present and are 
projected to rise to 30-40 million by the year 2000.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori on Tuesday solicited Japan's continued support for his 
country's bid to become a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Fujimori, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day 
unofficial visit, made the call in a meeting with former Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, aides to the Japanese political leader 
said. 
  Kaifu was quoted as saying that APEC, established in 
November 
1989 as a loose consultative body, should be open in nature. He 
offered to convey Peru's desire to concerned parties. 
  APEC, which currently has 17 members representing about 40 
percent of the world's population, agreed last November to 
freeze new membership for three years. 
  It links Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand 
and the United States. Chile will be made a full member at an 
informal summit in November. 
  While Japan has urged fellow members to allow Peru to 
participate in the forum's working group meetings, no consensus 
has been reached on the matter. 
  Fujimori is due to leave Wednesday for China for an official 
visit.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- France will host a 
17-nation AIDS summit in Paris in November because the AIDS 
epidemic is now too serious to leave to medical experts alone, 
an emissary for the French health minister said Tuesday [8 
March] in Tokyo. 
  Jean Francois Girard, director general of health in the 
French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and City, told a news 
conference that the one-day summit will bring together heads of 
at least 17 nations to consider ways to fight the AIDS epidemic 
on a global level. 
  "Till now, health problems have been treated by doctors, but 
AIDS is too serious to be treated only by doctors," Girard said. 
  "For the first time in the history of the world, heads of 
government will be considering a health problem. It will be a 
historic turning point." 
  Girard visited the Health and Welfare Ministry on Monday and 
the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday to explain the goals and solicit 
participation. 
  He said the 17 countries to be invited include those whose 
contribution to the international fight against AIDS is the 
greatest. Among them are Australia, Canada, France, Japan, 
Russia, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. 
  He said United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has indicated he would like to attend. 
  Girard said several international organizations, including 
the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Education, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the U.N. 
Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Fund for Population 
Activities (UNFPA) and the World Bank will have input into 
planning the summit agenda. 
  He said experts in many other AIDS-affected countries who 
are 
not invited will be consulted at the preparatory stage. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will chair the 
summit, 
for which no final date has been set. 
  The gathering was originally scheduled for June, but Girard 
said it was postponed because many heads of state could not come 
in June and because Japan will host an international meeting of 
AIDS experts, including doctors, researchers, and AIDS 
sufferers, in Yokohama in August. 
  About 10,000 people from more than 140 countries, including 
some 1,000 AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS-causing human 
immunodeficiency virus, are expected to attend the Yokohama 
meeting. 
  Girard said the Paris AIDS summit will be able to capitalize 
on decisions made at the Yokohama conference.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States agreed Friday [11 February] to cooperate on global issues 
in 15 fields, including AIDS and population problems, saving the 
bilateral framework talks from ending in a complete flunk. The 
two governments agreed on the global cooperation, one of three 
pillars in the trade framework negotiations along with 
macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, at the summit talks 
between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  Under the accord, Japan and the U.S. together will offer 12 
billion dollars over seven years to tackle issues involving AIDS 
and population problems. Of the total amount, the U.S. is to 
disburse 9 billion dollars and Japan will offer 3 billion 
dollars. 
  The two countries will also cooperate in developing 
environmental technologies and developing human resources. 
  Tokyo and Washington failed to strike a deal on the other 
areas of the framework talks to slash Japan's huge trade surplus 
and boost the share of imports in its markets. The two sides 
remain deadlocked over the definition of "objective criteria" in 
accessing foreign access to Japanese markets such as autos and 
auto parts, insurance and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment.

  [Text] Yokohama, March 20 KYODO -- Two new faces Sunday 
[20 March] filed as candidates to challenge the incumbent in the 
April 3 mayoral election in Yokohama, Japan's second most 
populous city. 
  The three men who filed candidacy papers were incumbent 
mayor 
Hidenobu Takahide, 64, and challengers Toshihiko Izu, 67, and 
Takashi Nomura, 40. 
  All three are independents. 
  Takahide, who is seeking a second four-year term of office, 
has gained the backing of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
Social Democratic Party, Komeito, Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  Izu, a professor emeritus at Yokohama City University, is 
backed by the Japanese Communist Party, while Nomura, a former 
Home Affairs Ministry bureaucrat, has garnered support from new 
party Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party. 
  Yokohama, the largest international port city in Japan, has 
a 
population of 3.3 million, ranking second after Tokyo which has 
a population of more than eight million. 
  The challengers have accused Takahide of having received a 
huge amount of election campaign funds from general contractors. 
Takahide denies the allegation.

  [Text] The House of Representatives overwhelmingly 
approved a bill Thursday [23 June] to reduce the current 6.5 to 
1 disparity in the weight of a vote in various House of 
Councillors constituencies to 5 to 1. 
  The House of Councillors approved the bill Wednesday. 
  The amendment bill cleared the lower chamber's plenary 
session with the backing of almost all political parties and 
parliamentary groups except the Japanese Communist Party. 
  An upper house poll in the summer of 1995 will be held under 
the new electoral system. 
  The bill adds one seat to each of four underrepresented 
upper 
chamber constituencies in Miyagi, Saitama, Kanagawa and Gifu 
prefectures, while taking away two seats from the 
overrepresented Hokkaido electorate and one each from the 
prefectures of Hyogo and Fukuoka, legislators said. 
  The bill alleviates the current situation under which some 
relatively sparsely populated constituencies have more 
representation in the upper house than more densely populated 
constituencies, mainly in or near urban areas. 
  The amendment was submitted after a 1993 Osaka High Court 
ruling that the current maximum disparity of 6.48 to 1 violates 
the constitutional principle of equality for all under the law, 
the legislators said. 
  The amendment would reduce the maximum disparity to 4.81 to 
1, they said. 
  The bill was initially introduced in the upper chamber under 
the cosponsorship of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], Komeito [Clean Government Party], 
the Niin Club and the Shin Ryokufu Kai -- a parliamentary group 
comprising the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan New Party, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Democratic Reform Party. 
  Goken Liberal No Kai, a five-legislator group of the upper 
chamber, balked at the bill, saying it is not enough to 
accomplish fairness in voting power.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev warned Friday [8 April] that some leading Russian 
politicians' attempts to stir up nationalistic sentiments among 
Russians residing in Kazakhstan and other former Soviet 
republics may trigger an exodus of refugees. 
  "If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in Kazakhstan 
took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to 
move to Russia or other areas, they would plunge into a more 
severe situation than now," Nazarbayev said. 
  "Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest 
anxiety comes from this issue," Nazarbayev told the Japan 
National Press Club on the final day of his four-day visit to 
Japan. 
  At present, some 5 million Russians, or more than a quarter 
of Kazakhstan's population, reside in the country which has a 
population of 17 million. Germans and Ukrainians each account 
for some 5 percent of the populace. Under the 19-century 
colonial policy of Czarist Russia, Russians were ordered to move 
to the central Asian country. 
  Nazarbayev accused Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and other politicians of having tried to rekindle Russian 
nationalist sentiments in a bid to lure Russian voters during 
1993 parliamentary election campaigns. 
  Kozyrev said last November 22 -- three weeks before the 
parliamentary vote -- that Moscow would "protect the Russian 
population and Russia's interests in a tough manner, wherever it 
is needed and whoever is concerned, even if it (concerns) our 
friends." 
  "The treatment of official Russian representatives, 
servicemen and our compatriots on the territory of any state, be 
it near or far abroad, is the litmus paper on which good 
neighborly relations with any state will be tested," Kozyrev 
said. 
  Nazarbayev told the press conference, "these Russian 
politicians tried to draw strength from the theme of the 
interests of 'Russia' in view of the December 11 parliamentary 
election." 
  Nazarbayev said there is no rationale for any calls for an 
exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan, as the Kazakh Government has 
taken a "policy of providing free plots of land to enable all 
residents to build homes and plow fields," whatever ethnic group 
they may belong to. 
  Nazarbayev refused to comment on press reports that Russia 
and the former Soviet Union bought U.S. security secrets from 
alleged U.S. Central Intelligence Agency turncoat Aldrich Ames 
over the past eight years for 2.5 million dollars. 
  Asked about U.S. congressional arguments calling for a halt 
to aid to Russia following the reported espionage case, 
Nazarbayev said, "I am not in a position to give advice to other 
countries on their aid policy to Russia."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Seventy percent of 300 
single- seat constituencies being set up under new political 
reform bills will be redrawn according to a 1991 plan presented 
to then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, according to a survey 
released Saturday [26 February]. 
  A KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey of politicians and people 
concerned in 47 prefectures found that more than 200 new 
single-seat districts will be invented according to the draft 
plan. 
  Only 60 to 70 districts, mostly in the densely populated 
Kanto and Kinki regions, will be newly created under legal 
procedures after the expected passage of an amendment of the 
package of political reform bills in early March. 
  The political reform bills, which were approved in January 
after a long battle in the Diet, calls for replacing the present 
511 multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of 
300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional 
representation seats. 
  In about 45 new single-seat constituencies, the ruling 
coalition parties must single out their candidates since they 
have more than one incumbent lower house member in corresponding 
present multiseat districts. 
  The opposition LDP, which was ousted from power last August 
by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
hosokawa, must make similar adjustments of their candidates in 
about 35 single-seat districts. 
  Totally new districts in which there are virtually no 
"incumbent" members will come into existence as well, with the 
number of such districts reaching more than 90 for the ruling 
parties and nearly 120 for the LDP. 
  The 8th Election System Council, a government advisory 
council, submitted the draft plan for redrawing electoral 
districts for the lower house in June 1991 to Kaifu, then prime 
minister and LDP president. 
  In drawing up the 300 single-seat constituencies, the 
council 
set 549,000 as an upper limit for the population of a voting 
district and 274,000 as a lower limit. 
  The population of six of the proposed constituencies will be 
allowed to remain below 274,000 as exceptions. 
  On the council's plan, many of those surveyed complained 
that 
it ignores regional history and geographical conditions, but 
some said another plan would cause problems such as 
contradiction of the weight of vote per voter. 
  Kaifu and his LDP successor Kiichi Miyazawa were dislodged 
from power due to their failure to achieve political reform. 
  Kaifu, speaking to the LDP's local convention in Nagoya, 
central Japan, said Saturday politicians should not intervene in 
redrawing the single-seat districts. 
  The government "should redraw (the electoral districts) 
fairly by entrusting the task with a third organization," he 
said.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States vowed Tuesday [24 May] to create a joint health program 
for children to stamp out polio from the face of the world by 
the year 2000. 
  "We believe (this goal) is technically feasible," said 
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth in 
announcing the joint program. 
  The program is a new "common agenda" initiative the two 
countries created Tuesday as part of a year-old bilateral accord 
to promote cooperation on global social and environmental issues. 
  Wirth said the two countries also agreed to pool their aid 
resources and launch a second child health initiative to develop 
an inexpensive, "one-fits-all" children's vaccine to fight 
disease in developing countries. 
  In addition, the United States and Japan agreed to expand 
their "common agenda" plan on narcotics control, the protection 
of coral reefs, and the expansion of global changes research in 
Asia and Latin America, the two sides said in a statement 
released after a general meeting of the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda 
for Global Cooperation. 
  The "common agenda" program is the least controversial part 
of a highly contentious framework agreement the two countries 
concluded in July last year to define a "new economic 
partnership" between the two countries. 
  By stepping up bilateral cooperation on global 
social-economic issues while fighting on the trade front, the 
two countries have shown that "you can walk and chew gum at the 
same time," Wirth said. 
  The two countries have not yet worked out details of their 
new child health program, but Wirth said it involves bilateral 
cooperation in research and development, plus production and 
distribution of children's vaccines for use in developing 
countries. 
  "We believe that aggressive cooperation between the two 
countries...can lead to the eradication of polio worldwide by 
the year 2000," Wirth said. 
  Under the "common agenda" program, Japan and the United 
States have already agreed to pool their resources to control 
global population growth, battle the AIDS epidemic in developing 
countries and promote worldwide environmental projects. 
  A new environmental program approved Tuesday calls for 
providing financial aid to the Philippines to build a 
biodiversity training site at Subic Bay to protect lowland rain 
forests. 
  The two countries also pledged to finance a community 
resource conservation and development program in Papua New 
Guinea aimed at encouraging tribal clans to preserve endangered 
forests by promoting income alternatives. 
  On the AIDS front, the United States and Japan agreed to put 
six countries -- the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Ghana, Kenya 
and Egypt -- on their "priority" lists for a joint U.S.-Japan 
AIDS-fighting assistance program. 
  The two countries have so far pledged to provide up to 12 
billion dollars by the year 2000 to fight AIDS and control 
exploding population growth in the developing world.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Asian Family Planning </F>
Urged--Conference Pushes More Regional Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Premier Li Peng yesterday called for greater 
regional cooperation to stem the population tide sweeping across 
Asia -- home to 60 percent of the world's populace. 
  He pledged that China will continue its efforts at 
population 
control by sticking to its family planing policy; those efforts 
help develop the economy and improve people's daily lives. 
  And other Asian nations should formulate their own 
strategies. But their plans need to be developed according to 
individual characteristics, he said in a written statement to an 
Asian Pacific population seminar. 
  The question of population is a question of development in 
essence, the Premier added, and can only be tackled at its root 
according to each country's natural conditions, tradition and 
economic level. 
  The 10th Asian Parliamentarians Meeting on Population and 
Development is seeking solutions to Asian population problems. 
  More than 50 parliamentarians and scholars from 17 nations 
were drawn to the two-day seminar, organized by the Asian 
Population and Development Association (APDA) based in Japan and 
the Education, Science, Culture and Public Health Committee 
(ESCPH) of the National People's Congress of China. At the 
opening of the meeting, APDA Chairman Fukusaburo Maeda said 
controlling Asia's population is a decisive global issue. Its 
populace is expected to top 3.34 billion people this year. 
  It has six of the 10 most populated countries in the world: 
China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Japan and Bangladesh. 
  Maeda praised China's efforts to contain its birth rate, an 
"unmatched success in population policy while proceeding with 
rapid economic growth." 
  The population by the end of last year was 1.18 billion, 
according to the newly published statistics. 
  The birth rate fell from 33.43 per thousand in 1970 -- 
before 
family planning -- to 18.09 in 1993. And natural population 
growth has continued its fall, from 14.55 per thousand in 1981 
down to last years 11.45. 
  Without the policy 15 million more babies would have been 
born over the past five years. 
  Maeda said quick solutions to overpopulation in Asia would 
help ensure domestic stability. 
  Analysts recommended controlling the birth rate eradicating 
poverty, creating sufficient food and job opportunities, 
improving education standards, literacy rates and living 
conditions. 
  Chinese ESCPH Chairman Zhao Dongwan said that the nation's 
ultimate goal is to educate and explain to the people why family 
planning is so important. That way, he said, future generations 
will carry on the practice on their own. 
  He admitted that obstacles to China's development and 
population quality still exist, including economic and social 
development, resource utilization and environmental protection. 
  China, by sharing problems of unbalanced population problems 
and socio-economic development with other developing Asian 
countries, needs to strengthen cooperations with them to further 
contain its expansion of population. 
  Also yesterday, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi, 
parliamentary leader, met with the Asia-Pacific parliamentarians 
and scholars at the Great Hall of the People.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- An international gathering 
to discuss measures to achieve environmental conservation and 
economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 
century will be held in Tokyo on March 16 and 17, government 
officials said Friday [4 March]. The meeting will be attended 
by experts from Asian and Pacific countries and the United 
Nations, they said. 
  At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO 
Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency 
pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of 
other Asia-Pacific nations and the U.N. The first meeting on 
the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" will decide on the date of 
release of the report while discussing concrete measures, the 
officials said. 
  Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an 
interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year 
and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in 
1997, they said. The plan will propose policies, financial aid 
and international cooperation needed to maintain the environment 
and yet promote development in the region. The experts will 
draft the program after making projections for the region's 
future population, economic growth, manufacturing, agriculture, 
forestry, demand for energy, state of urban areas, and 
environmental conservation policies, the officials said.

  [Text] Washington, February 5 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Government is to increase its financial assistance to the 
worldwide population control, official sources said here today. 
  "If we can't stabilize the world's population, we're not 
going to be able to control any other problems," said State 
Department Counselor Tim Wirth, who is in charge of population 
policy. 
  President Bill Clinton announced last Monday the 1995 U.S. 
Federal Budget will include 585 million U.S. dollars population 
control assistance, up from about 503 million dollars this year, 
press reports here said. 
  The U.S. is also teaming up with Japan to boost aid for 
population stabilization programs in poor countries. 
  When Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits 
Washington later next week, he and Clinton will announce an 
accord on population assistance. Japan is expected to commit 3 
billion dollars by the end of the decade for population programs 
and combating AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in 
developing countries, an AP report quoted U.S. Government 
officials as saying. 
  Population experts project today's world population of 5.5 
billion will grow by 1 billion over the next decade, and double 
to 11 billion in 40 years. 
  By the year 2050, it will reach 12 billion, with more than 
90 
percent of the growth occurring in developing nations. 
  The present U.S. population of 259 million, growing at a 
slower rate, is projected to reach 392 million by the year 2050. 
  The Clinton administration has decided that stabilizing 
population is crucial to alleviating poverty and hunger. 
  The 1995 U.S. Federal Budget of around 1.5 trillion dollars 
will boost U.S. assistance to the U.N. Population Fund - which 
was cut off during the Reagan and Bush administrations - from 
the current 40 million dollars to 60 million dollars a year. 
  Wirth said that he hopes the U.S. population assistance to 
the U.N. Population Fund to top 1 billion dollars by the end of 
the decade. The goal is to ensure that every woman who wants 
family planning assistance can get it.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 12 KYODO -- The United States 
called off threatened sanctions against Japan on Saturday [12 
March] after Tokyo bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to a deal 
that will assure at least 300 million dollars in business for 
Motorola Inc., a major U.S. cellular phone system maker. 
  "We are delighted with the result," U.S. Trade 
Representative 
Mickey Kantor said in announcing that Washington has decided to 
drop retaliatory moves against Japan. 
  The cellular phone trade agreement, announced in Tokyo on 
Saturday, came five days before Kantor was set to unveil a list 
of Japanese products that would be subject to punitive import 
tariffs. 
  Kantor hailed the accord, which commits the Japanese 
Government to underwrite a commitment from Motorola's Japanese 
partner to expand the American cellular system in the 
Tokyo-Nagoya area, as the sort "results-oriented" trade pacts 
Washington wants from Japan in the future. 
  "That is what portends for the future in our efforts to open 
(the Japanese) markets," Kantor said at a news conference. 
  The agreement, which Motorola and its Japanese partner 
Nippon 
Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) concluded under prodding from U.S. and 
Japanese Governments, has set specific terms the Japanese firm 
must meet by December 1995. 
  Top among them includes a commitment by IDO, which operates 
both a Motorola and a rival Japanese cellular system, to build 
159 relay stations over an 18-month period. 
  That infrastructure facility would enable the Motorola 
system 
to cover 95 percent of the cellular market in a heavily 
populated corridor extending from Tokyo to Nagoya. 
  At present, the Motorola cellular system can be used only in 
40 percent of the localities in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. 
  The Motorola-IDO accord also commits the Japanese cellular 
operator to freeze the development of the rival cellular system 
developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and 
launch a sales campaign to promote the Motorola system. 
  Under a separate government-to-government accord, the 
Japanese Government has also pledged to "monitor and oversee" 
the completion of IDO commitments and review progress with the 
U.S. Government every three months. 
  "This agreement validates our results-oriented approach," 
Kantor said. 
  President Bill Clinton also hailed the cellular phone accord 
in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday as "a big win for 
everyone." 
  "Workers in the United States will gain because the 
agreement 
means more demand for cellular telephones and related equipment 
made in America. Japanese consumers win because they'll have 
access to better service and better technology at better 
prices," the president said. 
  Motorola President Christopher Galvin, who spoke to 
reporters 
after Kantor's press conference, said the infrastructure 
facilities IDO has undertaken to build will give his firm 300 
million dollars in extra business and create "hundreds of jobs" 
in the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A consumption tax hike is 
needed to finance a possible increase in social security costs 
in the face of Japan's rapidly aging society, the chief of a key 
government advisory panel on tax affairs said. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said his panel 
will 
provide options such as a hike in the controversial consumption 
tax, an increase in social insurance premiums or no raise in 
social security costs to meet an aging society. 
  "But it will be understood naturally the best way is a raise 
in the consumption tax," Kato said in an interview with KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. 
  The issue of how to respond to the nation's aging population 
with tax measures has been in the spotlight for some time. 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed two months ago to sell 
a proposal to introduce a national welfare tax to fund more than 
welfare alone. 
  The Finance Ministry has been pushing for a hike in the 
consumption tax as a way to raise funds to meet the needs of an 
aging society. Kato is viewed as close to Finance Ministry 
bureaucrats. 
  Kato, a professor emeritus at Keio University, also points 
to 
the need to implement administrative and fiscal reforms and to 
rectify the heavy dependence on direct taxes for state revenue. 
  But Kato said no one can expect administrative and fiscal 
reforms to save government spending in the short run, and a 
sweeping reform of the so-called unfair taxation system could 
result in additional tax revenue of only 1 trillion yen. 
  As for a local consumption tax proposed by the Home Affairs 
Ministry, Kato said he would like to discuss it in the form of a 
possible retail tax instead. 
  He also said his panel will take up the issue of whether or 
when to introduce a taxpayers' numbering system. 
  "It's no good to say just 'we'll consider it.' I hope to 
draw a conclusion on the issue, including whether to introduce 
it, by setting a deadline," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD), 
whose purpose is to strengthen and promote cooperation among 
parliamentarians of some Asian countries, opened here today. 
  A message of congratulation from Chinese Premier Li Peng was 
read out at the opening ceremony. 
  Noting that Asia is the most populous region and also widely 
held to be the region with the most dynamic economic growth, Li 
said "To study and address the population problem of Asia will 
contribute significantly not only to Asia's prosperity and 
stability, but also to global peace and development." 
  The question of population is, in essence, a question of 
development, Li said. Only when the interaction between socio- 
economic development and population control is given thorough 
and balanced consideration can the problem of population be 
tackled at its root. 
  Li said that given the fact that countries vary considerably 
in their national conditions such as the level of economic 
development, natural resources, traditions, culture and 
religious practice, it is necessary for each country to 
formulate effective population and development policies in the 
light of its economic and social development and its other 
specific conditions and to strengthen international cooperation 
on this basis. 
  He said that women are an important force for promoting 
human 
progress and social development. An enhanced role and improved 
status of women will surely facilitate a rational resolution to 
the population problem. 
  Li noted that the Chinese Government has always attached 
great importance to the question of population and development 
and made family planning a basic state policy. 
  While vigorously promoting socio-economic development, he 
said, China has implemented family planning to bring congruity 
between population growth and socio-economic development so as 
to ensure prosperity for the country and a better life for its 
people. 
  Li said that China is ready to continuously strengthen its 
exchanges and cooperation with other countries and international 
organizations and work unremittingly for the stabilization of 
population and for prosperity and peace in Asia and the world. 
  Among those present were Zhao Dongwan, leader of the 
delegation of China's National People's Congress (NPC) and 
chairman of the NPC Education, Science, Culture and Public 
Health Committee; Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian 
Population and Development Association; Shin Sakurai and Prasop 
Ratanakorn, chairman and secretary general of the AFPPD 
respectively; Hirofumi Ando, deputy executive director of the 
U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) [acronym as received]; and 
parliamentarians, scholars and experts from 15 countries 
including China, representatives of international organizations, 
and some Beijing-based diplomatic envoys. 
  In his speech, Zhao Dongwan spoke highly of the many Asian 
countries which have made progress in birth control and 
population quality over the past decade. 
  Reviewing the remarkable achievements made by China in 
economic growth and population control, he said that although 
the fertility rate in China has dropped noticeably, the annual 
net population increase is still estimated at around 16 million. 
  Therefore, he said, China must strictly enforce family 
planning to control population growth, while developing its 
economy. 
  Zhao said that realizing sustainable and harmonious 
development is considered a long and arduous task but the only 
alternative for China over a long period of time. 
  He said that China, like many other developing countries in 
Asia, is facing an incompatibility between population growth and 
socio- economic development. China attaches great importance to 
friendly cooperation with Asian countries. 
  Zhao said he hoped the meeting would deliberate on 
population 
and development issues, particularly the status of women. 
  The Chinese delegates are willing to make the meeting a 
success along with other participants and to contribute to the 
International Conference on Population and Development to be 
held in Cairo in September this year, he said. 
  Fukusaburo Maeda said the significance of the meeting is 
underlined by the fact that it is being held in China, "which 
has the greatest population of all countries in the world and 
which, moreover, has achieved an unmatched success in population 
policy while proceeding with rapid economic growth." 
  He described China's extraordinary growth of the economy and 
the population growth control as "clear proof that population 
and development are closely related." 
  Shin Sakurai and Hirofumi Ando also delivered speeches at 
the 
meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa told Benin President Nicephore Soglo on Monday [21 
February] that Japan will give the African republic 1.11 billion 
yen to help purchase medical equipment for a national university 
and other equipment for the state-run broadcasting station. 
  Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Soglo, who 
arrived 
in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day visit, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  The meeting lasted nearly 40 minutes and was followed by a 
75- minute dinner, both at Hosokawa's official residence. 
  The Japanese aid includes 565 million yen to help Cononou 
National University improve its medical equipment and another 
500 million yen as a nonproject grant-in-aid, the officials said. 
  It also includes 46 million yen as the first cultural 
grant-in- aid to purchase equipment for the state-run television 
station to produce educational and cultural programs, they said. 
  The Japanese Government has already pledged Benin a total of 
400 million yen worth of aid in fiscal 1993 that ends March 31, 
1994. 
  The aid included 100 million yen in food and 300 million yen 
to increase the production of food, the officials said. 
  Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is 
a 
former French colony that became a republic in 1958, changing 
its name from Dahomey in 1975. It has a population of about 
five million. 
  It was under communist rule until 1990 but is currently 
boosting democratization efforts, the officials said. 
  During the meeting, Soglo, 59, requested Japanese political 
and economic support for his nation, they said. 
  The president is scheduled to meet Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko on Tuesday. He will visit Nagoya on Wednesday 
before heading home Thursday. 
  Soglo visited Japan in 1990 as prime minister to attend the 
emperor's enthronement ceremony. He also came to Tokyo last 
October to attend an international conference on aid to Africa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [16 May] made a renewed pledge to seek permanent 
membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], saying Japan 
should gain a permanent seat in the key council to break its 
monopoly by war victors. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that 
there is a growing voice in the United Nations for Japan to play 
a larger role in the key UN forum, which was set up by the 
victors of World War II. 
  Hata said many important issues, including even environment 
and population problems, are decided at the council. 
  "There is a call in the UN in the new age for Japan to play 
a 
role," Hata said. 
  The premier responded to questions by Manso Hamamoto of the 
Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and Akira Kuroyanagi of 
Komeito over Hata's key policy speech before the Diet last week. 
  Hata also said the government is working on objective 
criteria to measure progress in Japan's market opening steps to 
reduce its huge trade surplus with the U.S., but reiterated his 
refusal to set numerical targets. 
  While stressing the importance of improving soured trade 
ties 
with the U.S., Hata said setting numerical targets would run 
counter to the efforts for administrative reform aimed at 
lessening the government's intervention in the private sector. 
  The bilateral talks under a trade framework agreement 
foundered in February, when former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa rejected demands by U.S. President Bill Clinton for 
numerical targets to gauge market access improvement in some 
sectors, such as in autos, insurance and medical equipment 
procurement.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel 
called Thursday [16 June] for "urgently" implementing a set of 
economic restructuring measures to revitalize Japan's economy 
toward the next century. "The Japanese economy now stands at 
the crossroads," the Industrial Structure Council said in a 
report, citing such problems as the rapid aging of the 
population, the lingering current account imbalance and the 
"excessive" strength of the yen. 
  The report urged the government to formulate a reform 
program 
by effectively combining three types of steps -- macroeconomic 
restructuring measures like social infrastructure improvement, 
microeconomic reforms such as deregulation and narrowing of the 
price gap between Japan and other countries, and overhauling the 
industrial structure for new business creation. 
  The advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry said the government's failure to carry out these 
measures would deprive the Japanese economy of "industrial 
vitality" toward the next century, promote "industrial 
hollowing" and eventually degrade the overall life standard of 
the Japanese people. "The report is not merely a collection of 
recommendations that simply depict a vision of Japan's future 
economy," a ministry official said. "But it reflects a strong 
sense of crisis among council members about the future course of 
the Japanese economy," the official said. 
  The council cited 12 industrial sectors as having growth 
potential toward the 21st century. They are housing-related 
services, medical and welfare services, culture, urban 
development, environmental improvement, energy, distribution, 
new manufacturing technology, labor services, business support, 
information and communications, and cultural services involved 
in Japan's internationalization. 
  The proposed reform steps would help create a substantial 
amount of new business opportunities in Japan, with the market 
size of such business growing to 210 trillion yen in 2000 from 
the current 130 trillion yen in the 12 sectors combined. The 
council also said the reforms would produce 2.5 million new jobs 
by 2000. 
  If large-scale industrial restructuring is carried out, the 
Japanese economy could achieve an annual growth rate of more 
than 3 percent by the turn of the century, the report said. It 
also said Japan's manpower structure would undergo big changes 
under the proposed economic reform. 
  The proportion of workers in services and livelihood-related 
sectors would increase while those in distribution and 
transportation would drop, for example, the report said. 
Without the proposed reforms, Japan's economic growth would 
slow to an annual average of 1.6 percent during 1992-2000 and an 
average 1.2 percent during 2000-2010, the report said. The 
council said Japan should propose industrial policy coordination 
among developed countries as a way to spur new business 
creation, a step that may present solutions for global 
unemployment. 
  The issue of trade and labor standards should be addressed 
in 
a manner that would enable free trade to be pursued in 
developing countries while upgrading labor conditions there, the 
report said.

<TEXT>
   Statistics that show Japan's population growth
declining to a postwar low are likely to sharpen fears that lagging
birth rates are weakening the nation's economy.
   Preliminary figures released Friday from Japan's 1990 census
show the nation grew by only 2.1 percent from 1985 to 1990. The 3.4
percent growth from 1980-85 was the previous postwar low.
   The Oct. 1 census counted 123,622,541 people in Japan. The
country is still the world's seventh most populous, but it has one
of the world's slowest growth rates.
   Over the past year, the country has been flooded with magazine,
newspaper and television reports that speak of a ``baby shock.''
Officials express fear that with fewer children, the nation will
eventually have trouble supporting the elderly, a growing
percentage of the population.
   Business leaders say industry is already beginning to feel a
labor shortage.
   Birth rates in Japan have been declining since the introduction
of modern birth control after World War II, according to Dr. Makoto
Atoh, director of the Health and Welfare Ministry's department of
population policy studies.
   A housing shortage, high land prices, rising ages at marriage,
and the soaring costs of education and child-rearing have
contributed to the declining rate, he said.
   ``We think the major cause for the decline is the rising
percentage of singles and the rising age of marriage,'' Atoh said.
   Health and Welfare Ministry figures show that 20 percent of
people in their late 20s were single in 1975, but 37 percent in
that age group were single last year.
   Most women believe the high cost of educating children is the
biggest obstacle to having more, said Dr. Naohiro Ogawa, deputy
director of the Nippon University population research institute,
and the consultant for a recent survey by Mainichi newspaper.
   Another factor is cramped housing conditions and the
astronomical prices of new homes. Mechanization in the home,
expanded education and job opportunities have led an increasing
number of women out of the home.
   Some say the refusal of men to change their roles in the home
discourages large families.
   ``Japanese men don't share housekeeping. All the burden is on
the shoulder of women at home, so it's impossible to have more
children,'' said Mariko Mitsui, a Tokyo city assemblywoman.
   A government policy group has considered revamping maternity
leaves, changing housing policies, and improving child care as
measures to get women to have more children.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a governing Liberal
Democratic Party leader and a likely future prime minister, caused
an uproar in June when he was quoted as blaming the shrinking birth
rates on the expanded opportunities for higher education for women.
   Hashimoto later denied making the remark.
   Four out of five women questioned in the Mainichi survey said
they opposed government intervention to boost the birth rate, Ogawa
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Mar 4 KYODO -- An international gathering to 
discuss measures to achieve environmental conservation and 
economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 
century will be held in Tokyo on 16 and 17 March, government 
officials said Friday [4 March]. 
  The meeting will be attended by experts from Asian and 
Pacific countries and the United Nations, they said. 
  At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO 
Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency 
pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of 
other Asia-Pacific nations and the UN. 
  The first meeting on the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" 
will decide on the date of release of the report while 
discussing concrete measures, the officials said. 
  Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an 
interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year 
and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in 
1997, they said. 
  The plan will propose policies, financial aid and 
international cooperation needed to maintain the environment and 
yet promote development in the region. 
  The experts will draft the program after making projections 
for the region's future population, economic growth, 
manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, demand for energy, state 
of urban areas, and environmental conservation policies, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Dalian, China, May 17 KYODO -- A large industrial 
complex for Japanese enterprises has been completed in Dalian, 
Liaoning Province, northeastern China. 
  About 70 manufacturing enterprises, mostly Japanese, will be 
invited to build production facilities in the 
2.2-square-kilometer complex in the city's economic and 
technology development district, officials said. 
  Seventeen firms, including auto parts, steel and towel 
manufacturers, have already signed contracts to secure space. 
  About 3,200 foreign firms, including 591 from Japan, had 
established offices or plants in the quickly developing city as 
of last August, they said. 
  As a result, the city's Japanese population doubled to about 
2,000 in the last one and a half years, they said. 
  China and Japan began the joint 3.5 billion yen project in 
October 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Outgoing Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, who is virtually certain to become premier later 
in the day, repeated suggestions Monday that he may ask Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to join the 
new cabinet. 
  Hata also indicated at a press conference after an 
extraordinary cabinet meeting, where the eight-month-old cabinet 
of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, that the changes 
in the new cabinet will be small to middle-scale. 
  Hata said that "in general," it is better to have heads of 
coalition parties in the cabinet to reflect the parties' 
opinions, indicating he may ask Murayama to join the cabinet. 
There were six SDP cabinet ministers in the Hosokawa government 
but Murayama did not hold any cabinet post. 
  Hata, who was also deputy premier in the Hosokawa 
administration, said that in principle, it is desirable for the 
ministers who helped compiled the fiscal 1994 budget bill to 
remain in the cabinet and respond to upcoming Diet 
interpellations on the budget. 
  Reviewing his eight-month-long tenure as foreign minister, 
Hata said he felt the world expected Japan to speak up more on 
the international scene. 
  Japan could make various proposals on problems such as 
population, environment, AIDS, disarmament and arms control, he 
said. 
  Hata also said foreign ministers should not change so often 
and that he regrets he was only able to hold the post for eight 
months. 
  He also said Japan should push ahead with deregulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan will contribute 3.6 
million dollars to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) to help repatriate Myanmar [Burma] refugees from 
Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials said Friday [14 January]. 
  The contribution is in response to a UNHCR appeal in 
December 
for a donation of about 34 million dollars in total for the 
repatriation program, the officials said. 
  The fund will be used to transport some 200,000 Myanmar 
refugees, provide goods for daily use and implement small-scale 
projects on agriculture, health, water and sanitation in support 
of resettlement of the repatriated people, they said. 
  Islamic residents account for about 3.8 percent of Myanmar's 
population of 42 million people, according to Foreign Ministry 
statistics. 
  Since 1991, Islamic Myanmar residents began moving to 
Bangladesh citing oppression, with the number of Myanmar 
refugees in Bangladesh reaching 250,000 by March 1992, they said. 
  But based on an agreement between foreign ministers of both 
countries, the refugees began returning to Myanmar and more than 
52,000 people have returned to date, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
studying the nation's overall development blueprint urges the 
government to take actual steps toward the relocation of the 
functions of the capital from Tokyo, according to the draft 
report by the panel obtained Saturday [28 May] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  The National Land Development Council also calls for a 
reprogramming of the government's development policy to enhance 
exchanges and alliances among regional communities, the draft 
report said. 
  The council's final report on its review on the nation's 
1987 
comprehensive development plan stressed the need for a 
reassessment of the traditional roles for the central and local 
governments as well as reorganizations of local communities. 
  The report, which should serve as the basis for the next 
development blueprint, is scheduled to be submitted to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on June 16 after approval by the council. 
  The report points to drastic changes in social conditions 
since the 1987 program, citing a declining birth rate, the 
dragging recession and the yen's upswing. 
  It advises the government to pay more attention to "exchange 
population," or the number of people who travel around at home 
or abroad. 
  As measures to boost local exchanges, it proposes the 
development of highways that connect local core cities, faster 
railway transportations, and new railway networks and better 
access to airports. 
  The council lauds proposed new corridors in the east and 
west 
Japan and along the Sea of Japan coastline as possible 
incubators for cross-regional intercourses. 
  In light of the increasing role that Japan should play in 
Asia, the report urges the creation of new economic areas 
surrounding the Sea of Japan or the Yellow Sea. 
  It also proposes nurturing "small global cities" that enjoy 
direct international exchanges in some specific fields. 
  To respond to the shift of production overseas by 
manufacturers and the increasing share of software industries, 
the report advocates the creation of higher-grade service 
industry through developing high-capacity, high-speed 
telecommunications networks utilizing the technology of optical 
fibers and telecommunications satellite. 
  The report also drew attention to environmental protection, 
and exhorts Japan's active involvement, not only domestically 
but globally, in the issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A senior 
telecommunications official said Friday [18 February] it is up 
to the private sector to resolve a dispute between Japan and the 
United States over U.S. access to Japan's cellular telephone 
market. 
  Yoshio Utsumi, director general of the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry's International Affairs Department, 
made the comment while briefing foreign reporters on Japan's 
position on the matter. 
  An official at the department confirmed the content of 
Utsumi's remarks at the briefing but said they were not as 
strong as had been reported. 
  AP-DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE reported that Utsumi warned that 
Motorola Inc.'s business in Japan could suffer if the company 
and the U.S. Government picked an "unnecessary" fight about the 
need for immediate results. 
  The ministry official said the tone of the U.S. wire 
service's report was too strong. "He (Utsumi) did not make such 
a warning. That story seems a little strong," the official said. 
  The U.S. Government said earlier this week it plans to 
impose sanctions against Japan for violating a 1989 bilateral 
cellular telephone agreement. 
  The agreement paved the way for Motorola to offer cellular 
telephones in the densely populated corridor between Tokyo and 
Nagoya on the basis of its own system. 
  Japanese officials say Tokyo has fulfilled its 
responsibilities to abide by the agreement, but the U.S. side 
complains that implementation of the agreement has effectively 
discriminated against Motorola.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] plans to allow a portion of the revenues collected from 
the consumption tax to be handled by local governments, ministry 
sources said Monday [30 May]. 
  The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the 
Home Affairs Ministry, which, along with local governments, has 
urged the introduction of a local consumption tax. 
  Currently, the state government collects all consumption tax 
revenues and distributes 20 percent of revenues to autonomies. 
  Under the Finance Ministry proposal, the same proportion of 
income from the consumption tax will be collected by 
municipalities and then pooled and distributed according to 
population and consumption levels. 
  Introduction of a local consumption tax is one of the 
focuses 
in the planned tax system overhaul the government plans to work 
out by late June. 
  The Finance Ministry initially opposed the idea but has 
conceded in the face of mounting calls for the need to boost the 
financial base of local governments. 
  Its proposal is slightly different from that of the Home 
Affairs Ministry, which requested that Japan's 47 prefectures 
collect the tax and the money gathered be distributed in 
accordance with the number of workers in each prefecture. 
  If the Finance Ministry's plan is accepted, the share of 
revenues for such major cities as Tokyo and Osaka will be much 
smaller than the original plan because many people who work in 
the major cities live outside city limits.

  [Text] Fukui, March 30 KYODO -- Activists of the 
international environmental organization Greenpeace arrived 
Wednesday [30 March] aboard the patrol boat MV Greenpeace in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to protest the start-up of Japan's 
prototype fast breeder reactor Monju there. 
  During the 10-day port call at Tsuruga, Captain Arne 
Sorensen 
and 18 Greenpeace activists will inform local residents of the 
dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo 
exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman Etsuko Ikeda said. 
  The fast breeder operated by the governmental Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. will soon reach what is 
called "criticality," the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is 
self-sustaining. Ikeda said Greenpeace estimates Monju will 
reach criticality on April 8. 
  The reactor, which uses a mixture of highly toxic plutonium 
and enriched uranium as fuel, will then produce 280,000 
kilowatts of electricity. 
  In a recent report, Greenpeace warned that Monju "could 
explode like an atomic bomb, killing thousands and contaminating 
most population centers in Japan and neighboring countries." 
  Greenpeace also alleged that the Japanese Government is 
withholding important data on the safety risk posed by Monju. 
Noting that the original safety assessment for the fast breeder 
was undertaken over 10 years ago, Greenpeace called for a new 
safety review and a full environmental impact statement. 
  On its previous mission last October, the MV Greenpeace 
monitored nuclear waste dumped into the Sea of Japan by Russia 
and the former Soviet Union.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale announced Saturday night [12 March] that the 
United States and Japan have reached an agreement on the opening 
of the Japanese cellular telephone market. 
  In a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, 
Mondale 
praised the Japanese Government for its hard work in resolving 
the long-standing problem. 
  "The government of Japan will take all available measures to 
ensure compliance with these commitments," the statement said. 
  Among the commitments are "to build 159 new base stations, 
containing an additional 9,900 voice channels, according to an 
agreed quarterly schedule, to provide coverage for 95 percent of 
the population by December 1995, and to reallocate spectrum for 
use by the U.S. technology-based system," it said. 
  "This agreement demonstrates that the U.S. and Japan can 
work 
together to achieve real market access in Japan," it said. 
  Meanwhile, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori 
Kanzaki issued a statement on the Japan-U.S. agreement, which 
read as follows: 
  1. Mr. Walter F. Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, and I 
have come to a final agreement today on the cellular phone issue 
between Japan and the United States of America. 
  2. Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) has drawn up a plan for 
expanded installation for the North American-type analog 
cellular telephone system and transfer of a part of the spectrum 
currently allocated to the company to the North American-type 
system portion. The Government of Japan and the Government of 
the United States of America have decided to take measures 
including holding of regular meetings to assess implementation 
of the IDO measures. 
  3. The Government of the United States will terminate 
actions under Section 1377 of of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competition Act in response to these measures to be taken by the 
Japanese side. 
  4. I would like to pay respect for cooperation by Ambassador 
Mondale and the efforts made by the corporations concerned 
during the process leading to the resolution of this issue. I 
earnestly hope that the settlement will translate into 
maintenance and further development of the good economic 
relationship between the two countries. 
  Later the same night, Mondale and Kanzaki had a joint news 
conference at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. 
  Mondale said the agreement is a good example for promoting 
the U.S.-Japan trade framework talks. He added that although 
the cellular phone negotiations are different from the framework 
talks, both sides should have heart-to-heart discussions with 
utmost effort. 
  Mondale also said the agreement will facilitate competition 
in high technology and will eventually benefit Japanese 
consumers. 
  Kanzaki said that Japan did not agree to setting of 
numerical 
targets with the agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
defended China's economic modernization program Thursday [24 
February], saying reforms are "without major problems" despite 
some symptoms of overheating. 
  While acknowledging foreign concerns about an overheating of 
the Chinese economy given its breath-taking double-digit growth, 
Zhu said he does not think the 13 percent growth of the past two 
years is too rapid, although prolonging such growth could prove 
difficult. 
  Zhu, seen as the main architect of China's ambitious 
economic 
reforms, said macroeconomic measures introduced last summer to 
rein in money supply and restore order to an inflation-wracked 
economy have stabilized prices and created an environment for 
stable growth. "We haven't seen big economic ups and downs," 
Zhu said, dismissing allegations that macroeconomic controls are 
failing. 
  Addressing Japanese business leaders at a Tokyo hotel, Zhu 
denounced foreign press reports of growing social unrest due to 
soaring prices as distorting reality. Although inflation in big 
cities has reached 18.6 percent, the urban population actually 
enjoyed better living standards as salaries increased by some 25 
percent last year, he said. 
  Beijing is well aware of inflationary risks but does not 
consider the current level of 13.4 percent as cause for concern, 
Zhu said, adding the increase in money supply has been 
successfully stabilized at about 20 percent. 
  The implementation of a comprehensive economic reform 
program, including the introduction of new taxes and a single, 
market-oriented foreign exchange rate system since January 1, 
has been "going smoothly and without creating major problems." 
  Beijing will do away with its special foreign currency swap 
centers from April 1, from which time foreign exchange will be 
handled solely through banks, said Zhu, who also heads China's 
Central Bank. 
  The planned transformation of China's banks into commercial 
banks will have to go hand in hand with the restructuring of 
unprofitable state enterprises which have depended on cheap 
loans while adjusting to market transition. Zhu predicted "big 
progress," however, in the privatization of the state-run sector 
this year. 
  Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will 
help gradually increase the central government's revenue share 
from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by the year 2000. 
  Zhu dismissed as "groundless" rumors that foreign companies 
will soon be listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. Beijing is 
taking a very cautious stance toward the country's fledgling 
stock exchanges, closely monitoring Chinese firms to prevent an 
"economic bubble" like that which occurred in Japan. 
  Japan-China trade, which soared by 54 percent to 39 billion 
dollars last year, is nevertheless "still small," considering 
the potential of China's huge market, he said. Increased 
investment and trade with China could help Japan overcome its 
prolonged recession and boost the competitiveness of Japanese 
products, Zhu pointed out, adding he hopes trade relations 
between the two countries would "reach a new level." 
  Zhu arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a nine-day trip 
focusing on increasing economic ties. Besides visiting a number 
of prefectures to study Japan's economic and corporate 
structures, the vice premier will also meet present and former 
political leaders.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 8 KYODO -- Japan and the U.S. agreed 
Wednesday [8 December] to draw up an action plan on bilateral 
cooperation on global problems such as the environment, 
technology, development of human resources, population and AIDS, 
Japanese and U.S. officials said. 
  The two nations will announce the plan in February at a 
summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Koichiro Matsuura told a joint press conference. 
  Japan and the U.S. reached the agreement during a second 
round of talks on a common agenda for global cooperation under a 
trade framework agreement reached between the two nations in 
July. 
  The meeting was held Wednesday morning at the Foreign 
Ministry. Matsuura headed the Japanese delegation and the U.S. 
side was led by Timothy Wirth, a State Department counselor. 
  During the meeting, Japan and the U.S. agreed that Russia's 
dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan was a 
"regrettable" act and agreed to continue exchanging information 
and discussing the matter, Matsuura said. 
  James Baker, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for oceanic and 
atmospheric affairs, told the news conference the countries 
strongly oppose any dumping of radioactive waste under the 
London Dumping Convention. 
  "We believe that Russians have acted in violation of the 
agreement by the London Dumping Convention," Baker said. 
  "Our joint support of the ban on dumping has been an 
important new step here," he said. 
  The two sides agreed to start a fellowship program for 
engineers from January. Some 30 U.S. engineers from companies 
such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will study for a 
year at Japanese firms like Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor 
Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Sony Corp. 
  For the next fiscal year, about 100 engineers will come to 
Japan under the fellowship. 
  Japan and the U.S. also discussed setting up a committee to 
cooperate on improvement of the environment in central and 
eastern Europe and are close to agreement on its establishment, 
Matsuura said. 
  Wirth said the two nations' cooperation in the area will 
make 
a "significant contribution in helping clean up enormous 
environmental problems that plague" the region.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa suggested Wednesday [16 February] Tokyo will file a 
complaint to the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
if the United States imposes trade sanctions on Japan. 
  "We will seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in 
accordance with international rules," said Hosokawa, during a 
plenary session of the House of Representatives. 
  He said Japan has not violated trade rules, and expressed 
concern about U.S. threats of sanctions. 
  Hosokawa's remarks came after the U.S. on Tuesday unveiled 
steps to impose sanctions worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. 
  The prime minister said Japan will "voluntarily" improve 
government procurement procedures and foreign access to its 
markets, but did not elaborate. 
  Hosokawa hailed his failed trade negotiations with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, saying the talks represented the outset 
of new Japan- U.S. relations reflecting a stronger sense of 
trust, in which both countries will make clear what they cannot 
do. 
  Hosokawa told the lower house he and Clinton held "good" 
talks in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on 
various issues, including the international situation. 
  Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral 
relations 
though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to 
slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in 
its markets, he said. 
  The premier said he and Clinton agreed to promote bilateral 
cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population 
and AIDS. 
  Hosokawa said he told Clinton that Japan would "do what it 
could" if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on North 
Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  He also called the planned one-time tax reduction an 
"emergency measure," saying permanent reductions of income and 
residence taxes will be included in the comprehensive tax reform 
he has pledged to carry out by the end of the year. 
  The ruling coalition agreed February 8 to implement a 
one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for 1994 as a means of 
stimulating the sluggish economy. 
  The tax reform package will include financing of the tax cut 
because, at the time of the agreement, Hosokawa was forced to 
abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 
7 percent "national welfare tax" mainly to finance the reduction.
